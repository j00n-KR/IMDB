0,SnoopyStyle,Seth is not a good comic actor,5,12 March 2015,"It's 1882 in the small town of Old Stump, Arizona. Albert (Seth MacFarlane) is not a manly man and not a particularly good sheep farmer. His girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) breaks up with him for Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). His best friends are Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and his prostitute girlfriend Ruth (Sarah Silverman). Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) is a ruthless bandit who places his wife Anna (Charlize Theron) in town. Albert befriends Anna who is looking for a nice guy.I have come to conclude that Seth MacFarlane is not a good comic actor. He's a good writer and is good with his voice. Here, he does poorly enough to make me question whether he's even actually a good director. He's just not expressive enough to be a performer. He's not leading man material. Without a real comic in the lead, Charlize Theron is put into an unenviable position to be funny. She's quite charming as the female Seth playing the dude in the relationship. Her cool-chick fun personality gives life to this movie but she is still not the lead. The two of them have good friendship chemistry together. There isn't much heat in the romance. I imagine many standup comedians and other actors could have excelled in this role. Seth is not the guy.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
1,Prismark10,Blazing photographers,4,14 September 2014,"First of all this is one of these films that showed all in its trailers, the good jokes that is.Secondly, Seth MacFarlane does not have enough to be a leading man and it needed another comedy actor to make the best of this film.Thirdly the story was let down when it lapses into frequent dullness. It needed to be sharper and wittier.What we have is a homage to the westerns mixed with low brow humour. Hold on, I think Blazing Saddles did this better.Amanda Seyfried and Charlize Theron are both appealing enough, Neil Patrick Harris gets into the spirit with a few off jokes and a song and dance number. Neeson plays it straight as the villain and there are a few cameos but its a poor show when the toilet humour are the best gags.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
2,nogodnomasters,If You've Only Got a Moustache,7,12 October 2018,"When you combine Seth MacFarlane with some major stars, you pretty much know what you are going to get: A crude comedy with some great scenes and a lot of scenes that don't work. This film is no different. The movie looks like it might be a spoof of the western film genre, but isn't. Its humor is generated from the crude anachronistic language, similar to Mel Brook's superior film ""History of the World..."" Some of the lines that didn't work were, ""You really shouldn't drink and horse.""Perhaps the biggest downer of the film was that Seth played the lead actor instead of hiring someone like Zach Galifianakis. Now if you don't think there were a million ways to die, Albert (Seth MacFarlane) gives us a head start on the list. The crude Sarah Silverman dialogue was perhaps the funniest part of the film. I always like it when she talks dirty.Fans of ""Ted"" should enjoy this film.Parental Guide: Excessive F-bombs. Sex. Rear male nudity...with a daisy",A Million Ways to Die in the West
3,kosmasp,Million ways to Ted in the West,6,20 September 2014,"No wait. This isn't Ted! Don't even think about Ted (until the sequel comes out that is, which might have happened by the time you read this). No try to watch this as what it is: a juvenile attempt to make a funny western movie. Which in parts does succeed. I'm not particular into all those fart jokes and whatnot, but the audience I was watching it with, was laughing almost all the time, so he must have done something right (at least).Now Sarah Silverman is known for having a potty mouth, shouldn't be a surprise either. One of the few surprises comes in the middle of the movie, inside a barn and with a quick cameo. Although it only really works, if you know and understand what this is about ... a nice touch for sure though. But that does not save the movie, neither does the added ending with another cameo and another reference (though much ""fresher""). Didn't catch it immediately, but someone in the audience did explain it to the rest. Not a bad effort, but maybe the high expectations made it fail in the end ...",A Million Ways to Die in the West
4,classicsoncall,"""What is there to live for on the frontier in 1882?""",7,1 February 2015,"I wasn't counting but I don't think there were a million ways to die here. What you have though is the ""Bad Santa"" of Western movies, a veritable ""Blazing Saddles"" on steroids by the time this thing runs it's course. I'm not big on the toilet humor aspects of the dialog here, but a lot of the picture actually was funny, leaving me more positive than negative on the movie. What MacFarlane's not afraid to do is take all the stereotypical PC nonsense and stand it on it's head, like you have in the runaway slave shooting gallery and the Islamic Death Chant. Maybe there was some outrage over this stuff when the flick came out but I didn't hear about it, but as you can see I'm a little late to this party. There was some clever stuff in the picture like the 'nobody's got a dollar' bit, the picture of the smiling guy, and the cowboy midgets, reminiscent of a real old time flick from 1938 - ""The Terror of Tiny Town"" with an all midget cast for a Western. Also somewhat derivative is the final showdown, hearkening back to the Gene Hackman/Sharon Stone spoof from 1995, ""The Quick and The Dead"". For me, the rapid fire one liners and snappy dialog get my attention, and total nonsense like Christopher Lloyd's cameo is always a treat. It shows that Seth MacFarlane is all over the place as a writer and nothing is too goofy that can't be worked into a script. I wonder what Clint Eastwood thought of Clinch Leatherwood.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
5,lee_eisenberg,Who hasn't wanted to picture the Old West as a bastion of teenage boy humor?,10,14 December 2014,"If you know that Seth MacFarlane is the creator of ""Family Guy"", then you'll have an idea of what ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" contains. Executive producing this year's ""Cosmos"" showed that he has a serious side, but his silliness is on full display here with him in the lead role. The movie shows what the Old West would've been like had it been the brainchild of 10- to 14-year-old boys. Not even ""Blazing Saddles"" showed the stuff that we see here! I found Sarah Silverman's character to be the funniest, speaking as casually as she does about oral and anal sex. As for scenes, I liked the whole sequence with the Indians the best. But the movie always knows which kind of movie it is. ""AMWTDITW"" definitely won't be for everyone, but if you can accept nonstop crude humor then you'll enjoy it. And you're bound to find Charlize Theron and Amanda Seyfried both really hot.Nerd a--hole. Ha!",A Million Ways to Die in the West
6,jboothmillard,A Million Ways to Die in the West,8,10 June 2014,"I saw a short trailer for this film, and as soon as I saw the leading star, also director, and the scenario, and having enjoyed his previous live action comedy Ted, I was absolutely looking forward to seeing this film. Basically in 1882, in the town of Old Stump, Arizona, cowardly sheep farmer Albert (Seth MacFarlane) is dumped by his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) following his refusal to fight in a gun duel, his only friends are inadequate Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and his openly prostituting wife Ruth (Sarah Silverman), Albert plans to leave for San Francisco, believing the frontier has nothing more for him. Meanwhile infamous outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) has robbed and killed an Old Prospector (Back to the Future Part III's Matt Clark) to steal his gold nugget, he wants to leave to continue his banditry, so he orders his man Lewis (Jarhead's Evan Jones) to take his wife Anna (Charlize Theron) to the town to lay low, they pretend to be out of town siblings wanting to buy a farm. Lewis gets arrested for starting a bar fight, Albert saves Anna from it, and they form a friendship, and decide to go to the town fair together, whether they encounter Louise and her new boyfriend, moustache emporium owner Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), he challenges Albert to a shooting contest, which he loses, Anna steps in and defeats him, but following insults Albert angrily challenges Foy to a duel. With a week until the duel Anna teaches Albert how to shoot, and in the evening they attend a dance, where he is again humiliated by Foy with a song called ""If You've Only Got a Moustache"", but she spikes his drink with laxative, on the way home Anna and Albert share a kiss, which is witnessed by Lewis who broke out of jail and murdered the Sheriff (Rex Linn, also the Narrator), he tells this to Clinch. On the day of the duel Foy arrives stumbling and defecating violently, but Albert has realised Louise is no longer worth fighting for anymore and again forfeits a fight, but in the saloon Clinch arrives and demands to know who kissed his wife, he shoots a cowboy when no-one comes forward, Anna is revealed as his wife, and he threatens to kill more people if the guilty man duels with him at the noon the next day. Away from town Anna is forced by her husband to reveal it was Albert who kissed her, but before he can rape her she knocks him unconscious, she goes to Albert's farm where he confronts her, and then Clinch returns and recaptures her, while Albert escapes, only to be ambushed and captured by a tribe of Native Americans/Indians. The tribe threaten to burn him alive, but he saves himself speaking their language, and settling with them they give him hallucinogenic drugs that give him crazy visions of his childhood, and making him realise his love for Anna, and following this Albert returns to face Clinch, he shoots the bandit in the arm, and he dies slowly as the bullet was poisoned with rattlesnake venom, in the end Louise tries to win Albert back, having proved himself brave, but he rejects her and enters a relationship with Anna. Also starring The Last of the Mohicans' Wes Studi as Cochise, Christopher Hagen as George Stark, Family Guy's Alex Borstein as Millie and Bill Maher as Barn Dance Comedian, with cameos by Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown mocking the western plot line of Back to the Future Part III, Aladdin's Gilbert Gottfried as Abraham Lincoln, Ewan McGregor as Cowboy at Fair (I didn't see him), Ryan Reynolds as the Man Killed by Clinch in the Bar, Sir Patrick Stewart as the Dream Voice, and Jamie Foxx as Django mocking the Django Unchained avenging of black slavery in the west. MacFarlane is likable as the frontier nerd, Theron is great being sassy and sexy, Neeson does well as the Irish villain, and spotting the genius cameos is fun, this is definitely the Blazing Saddles for the modern times, set in the Wild West, but with modern bad language and attitude, the best and most common jokes are the deaths and bodily functions, with some entertaining action thrown in, a really funny western comedy. Very good!",A Million Ways to Die in the West
7,paul_haakonsen,Could have been more enjoyable without the foul language...,5,31 August 2014,"I will say that the movie did have potential, and it did have a great story, just a shame that it was ruined by profoundly by below the belt jokes and foul language. Now, I am not one to frown upon foul language, but it was really inappropriate and misplaced in a western movie. And there was also a lot of things that were quite politically incorrect, so if you are easily offended, this movie might not just be for you.The story is about a sheep farmer named Albert who is dumped by his girlfriend Louise. He befriends a mysterious newcomer woman in town and finds out that she is the wife of a notorious gunslinger.The comedy throughout the movie was good enough, but mind you that there is a lot of jokes below the belt, and it is all accompanied by foul language. I laughed here and there, but it was starting to become too much and too immature towards the end.The acting in the movie was good, and Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron really carried the movie quite well.What was best about the movie was the cameo appearances throughout the course of the movie. You have Ewan McGregor, Ryan Reynolds, Patrick Stewart, Bill Maher, Jamie Foxx, but the best and most memorable appearance was Christopher Lloyd. And they reference to Mila Kunis during the scene with the Indians was also quite nice.The segment at the fair was without a doubt the best part of the entire movie.Overall, then I had initially expected much more from this movie, and having seen it, I must admit that I feel a little bit disappointed and cheated out of something that could have been so much more. If they had opted to not go with the foul language and excessive usage of the f-word, then just there the movie would have been much more enjoyable.""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" scores a mediocre 5 out of 10 stars from me.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
8,tavm,"With the many clever ways to present vulgar humor, I liked A Milllion Ways to Die in the West",7,10 June 2014,"Since I watched Ted about a year or so ago, I became aware of this Seth McFarlane more and more especially when he hosted the Oscars last year. I found him often clever and funny even with his take on many vulgarities which he continues with this movie. Since he co-wrote, directed, and is the leading player here, he should get credit for not only continuing to provide funny scenes and lines for his players but also some for himself especially when he rants on certain facts or just makes stuff up. There was also a cameo from another movie from the '80s that I was very pleasantly surprised by! So on that note, I recommend A Million Ways to Die in the West.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
9,edwagreen,Disgusting *,2,20 May 2015,"It's supposedly 1882 and Seth MacFarlane talks as though he is in current times and his constant use of profanity does not help matters either.Every conceivable way of dying in the most unusual ways are shown here. There are some disgusting scenes and for those who think they're comical, we have to set up some standards of morality.I don't know how Liam Neeson ever considered such a part in such a gross film.When you take all the vulgarity and nonsense away from the film, all you'd have is a simple tale of a gunslinger out to get his wife back and kill the guy with her.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

11,Scarecrow-88,A Million Ways to Die in the West,4,12 April 2015,"Seth MacFarlane is at it again, this time ribbing on the western genre, as a sheep farmer deeply wounded by his girlfriend's (Amanda Siefried; her eyes getting mocked as does her breed of pretty self-absorbed actress) leaving him for a mustachioed ""man of prosperity"", Neil Patrick Harris. Charlize Theron (beautiful even when ""glammed down"") is the wife of a notorious gunslinger (Liam Neeson) who falls in love with MacFarlane (and vice versa) not long after his emasculation when Harris bets against him in a shooting range at the fair (MacFarlane isn't much of a shootist, to say the least) and she has to win using her shooting skills. In a fit of anger, MacFarlane challenges Harris to a duel (backing out of a previous duel turned Siedfried off of him) but realizes how stupid that is considering he doesn't know how to shoot. So Theron (caring about him because he's actually a nice guy who doesn't deserve to be so mistreated) takes MacFarlane under her mentorship and helps him learn how to at least hit targets. Soon both are kissing, and her husband's bandit sees them, telling Neeson who isn't particularly happy about this. Sufficed to say, Harris becomes less of a threat (especially considering Theron soon slips him a drugged drink that causes him to defecate a lot) while Neeson arrives to put down the man responsible for kissing his wife.Family Guy and Ted put MacFarlane on the map, but I'm not sure the western genre was the right fit for his brand of comedy. I found a lot of the comedy rather akin to a square peg trying to fit in a circle. It isn't without its surprises like Lloyd's Back to the Future cameo and MacFarlane and Theron's good chemistry. I wish the film had more laugh-out loud moments, but the peyote-themed fantasy sequence with sheep as MacFarlane is induced by Cochise's (Wes Studi) drug while surrounded by his people who consider him a non-threat due to the fact that he can speak their language seems like a desperate attempt to go Family Guy (I can imagine the sound of crickets in the theatre instead of laughter), achieving zilch results. Neeson's presence in the film seems out of place (back to the square peg analogy), and thankfully he isn't in it all that long, except towards the end. All this said, some wonderful frontier cinematography provides some nature eye candy. Harris, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, and Siefried seem adrift during comic bits that never quite leap off the screen to tickle the funny bone. MacFarlane, to me, isn't much of a leading man, either. So not much I can recommend here, except seeing Theron as a gunslinger with no chance to square off with anyone.

12,LeonLouisRicci,Seth MacFarlaneLet's Talk About Your Potty Training,6,20 November 2014,"Writer/Director/Star Seth MacFarlane has a Deep Psychological Impairment that Stifles His Genius.

13,utgard14,It's not bad,6,5 October 2014,"Okay comedy from Seth MacFarlane, who I guess is now trying to become a face in front of the camera as well as behind. It's not as good as ""Ted"" was but still has some laughs. If you're familiar with MacFarlane's style, you know what to expect: lots of toilet humor and attempts at being offensive. The former is kind of tired out these days but the latter is appreciated, given how knee-jerk sensitive people are now. It's not hilarious. I laughed out loud a few times but most of the time I just chuckled. That's fairly common with me and comedies these days, though. So take into account reading this review that my tastes might not be the same as yours. As a lead, MacFarlane is fine. Maybe a proper actor would have been better but he doesn't embarrass himself. Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried, and Liam Neeson are good in their unchallenging roles. Giovanni Ribisi is largely wasted in a supporting part that doesn't give him a lot to work with. Neil Patrick Harris steals every scene he's in. There are several big-name cameos as well and most of them are funny. This is pretty low-brow stuff but there are moments where it's smart. It's not for the easily offended. It does go on a little long, but, for the most part, it's enjoyable enough. It's worth watching at least once.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
14,zardoz-13,Could Have Been A Million Times Better,5,2 June 2014,"Seth MacFarlane's half-baked horse opera ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is a saddle-sore saga. This lowest common denominator sagebrush satire boasts low-brow bowel humor, highly offensive language, and gory death scenes. Despite all these unsavory elements, this western spoof emerges as fair at best and routine at worst. Sporadically funny jokes and gags cannot conceal the conventions and clichés. The first problem is the trite Alex Sulkin, Wellesley Wild, and Seth MacFarlane screenplay. Recently, I watched an Eddie Albert comedy ""The Dude Goes West"" (1947) that covered similar ground with greater success. MacFarlane and his co-writers rant about the deplorable conditions governing life on the frontier in the 19th century American west. The hero and the heroine hate the west. This revulsion of all things western neither distinguishes MacFarlane's movie nor makes its humor any funnier. The only place where ""A Million Ways to Die"" breaks ground is with its raunchy R-rated jokes. Some of the jokes hit, but most miss. Some jokes are so vile they might gag the guys in the ""Jackass"" movies. Indeed, MacFarlane gets away with a lot in this lame oater, especially during the opening ""Gunsmoke"" showdown. The good jokes are really good. One of the best turns out to be badly told, but this serves to accentuate the humor. The second problem is most of the dialogue sounds like stand-up, comic routines. Some stand-up comedy routines are better than others. The best gag concerns Old West photography. The running joke is nobody smiles in a photograph in the 19th century. Nevertheless, the grinning photo attained the status as an urban legend. Those who aren't appalled by MacFarlane's infantile as well as scatological sense of humor will no doubt want to roll in it like a dog in its own feces. ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" struggles to emulate ""Blazing Saddles,"" deliver dialogue like ""Deadwood,"" and depict mortality like ""Faces of Death."" The setting of ""A Million Ways to Die"" is the town of Old Stump in the Arizona Territory in the year 1882. Our pusillanimous sheep farming protagonist, Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane of ""Ted""), sinks into a state of depression after his schoolmarm girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried), dumps him for a snotty lothario, Foy (Neil Patrick Harris of ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle""), who owns a mustache shop. No, nice-guy Albert doesn't sport a mustache. Louise left Albert because she classified him as too cowardly. During the opening Main Street showdown, Albert drops his six-gun in the dust rather than shoot it out with another gunman. Later, Albert challenges Foy to a duel. Meanwhile, a mysterious woman, Anna (Charlize Theron of ""Monster""), shows up and teaches Albert how to handle a hog-leg. Anna, as it turns out, is the wife of notorious outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson of ""Taken"") who eventually decides to shoot Albert for flirting with his wife. Basically, boy loses girl, boy tries to get girl back, but takes up with a different girl describes the storyline. An imbecilic subplot concerns the romance between a hard-working saloon prostitute, Ruth (Sarah Silverman of ""Evolution""), and a timid male virgin shoemaker, Edward (Giovanni Ribisi of ""The Mod Squad""), who has agreed to abstain from sexual intercourse with her until their wedding night. Albert and his friends emerge as likable, sympathetic characters, while Foy, Clinch, and Clinch's henchmen are as repulsive as rattlers.Although best known as the creator of the respective animated series ""American Dad"" and ""Family Guy,"" not to mention his previous blockbuster comedy ""Ted"" with Mark Wahlberg, MacFarlane must have been gambling that he could resurrect a moribund genre with his impertinent humor. Westerns have not performed well at the box office since the early 1990s, and even then the genre was riding on borrowed time. Since John Wayne died and Clint Eastwood grew too old to drift across the high plains, westerns have never regained their former grandeur. Disney's ""Lone Ranger"" tanked last summer, and only AMC's ""Hell on Wheels"" on television has survived with any success. Meantime, the Jeff Bridges ""True Grit"" remake and Quentin Tarantino's slave saga ""Django"" have proved to be exceptions to the rule. Nothing about MacFarlane's approach to the genre justifies its use. He appears out of place himself with his hopelessly clean-scrubbed, Shoney's Big Boy looks. Aside from his profanity, MacFarlane plays the same tenderfoot that Bob Hope, Eddie Albert, Gary Cooper, Don Knotts, or Tim Conway have all portrayed in earlier movies and television shows. Neil Patrick Harris usually steals the show, no matter what the material, but he makes only a minor impression with his Snidely Whiplash villain. Unfortunate Amanda Seyfried has little more to do than bulge her beautiful eyes and swish an umbrella. Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson wander through their roles. Colorful cameos by the likes of Christopher Lloyd, Gilbert Gottfried, Ewan McGregor, Jamie Foxx, and Bill Maher prove more stimulating.

15,grantss,Funny and entertaining,7,4 October 2020,"The American West, 1880s. A passive, shy sheep farmer tries to avoid conflict, a trait which has kept him alive but has now resulted in his girlfriend leaving him. She is now with a dapper, successful, extroverted store owner, Foy, a fact Foy keeps reminding him of. When the rivalry leads to a duel, he gets help from an unexpected, beautiful source.Pretty good, and unexpectedly so. I like Seth MacFarlane, largely for The Family Guy (but Ted was pretty good too), but his comedies can be low-brow at times and the trailers for the this seemed to bear that out. Having eventually watched this, I am pleasantly surprised.Quite funny with some of the usual MacFarlane humour: clever, satirical, topical and sometimes over the top. He does resort to some low-brow stuff on occasion but for the most part it quite original and intelligent.The plot is fairly conventional and merely a platform for the humour, but that's pretty much what you'd expect from a comedy.Solid performances from MacFarlane himself plus Charlize Theron, Neal Patrick Harris, Amanda Seyfried and Liam Neeson.Good fun.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Middle of the road,6,10 June 2014,"Albert(MacFarlane as a nerdy, cowardly sheep farmer you'll note that almost all of these characters are broad stereotypes, and not even well-done at that) gives up on the a duel(the first of three in this, each a ""touch base"", show where he is, growth-wise), and his girlfriend Louise(Seyfried, as the bitch ex who only wants successful men) leaves him for Foy(the douchy new boyfriend). He challenges the latter, and he will need all the help he can get on gun-fighting. He will receive it at the hands of Anna(the female wingman, who, you never know, may just end up falling for the lovable ugh). But then her husband, Clinch(Neeson, the toughest criminal around), comes to townThis is surprisingly conventional. The story structure is like that of a romantic comedy from 20 years ago. It doesn't even do anything interesting with the scenes that you see coming a mile away – showing up at her place drunk at night, showing up at the workplace of the new guy to confront him, trying to ""win"" over him, etc. The considerable talent here are utterly wasted. They get almost nothing to do, when they genuinely feel like they showed up to give it their all. This does look and feel like a Western. The focus is purely on the pathetic males, and them looking like fools in public so many awkward silences, supposed shows of strength, etc. and any woman in the cast is there to support them.When this goes for laughs, the material is actually pretty good, sometimes even hilarious, such as the comments on how sucky it was to be in that particular place and time. I'd say a good 2/3 of the jokes work – certainly this could do with some trimming for the rest of those, and in general the 110 minute running time is a good ¼ too long(no, I did not just learn fractions why would you think that?). The thing is, a lot of this just isn't really trying to be funny. That goes for the earlier-mentioned slog through bits you figured they'd skip, and humor is stripped from any scene that's meant to be sentimental, tense, or even forward the story. Some bits go on for too long. All offensive/ethnic/gross-out gags intentionally go really far, without being funny it's as if those are trying to stick in your mind not for any enjoyment value, but for how aggressive they are.This contains some brutal, gory, bloody and disturbing content, in addition to what I've already mentioned.

18,neil-476,Funny but filthy,8,5 June 2014,"In 1882 Arizona, sheep farmer Albert, downhearted after girlfriend Louise dumps him for sleazy Moustachery proprietor Foy, is helped by gorgeous newcomer Anna to work on getting her back. What Anna doesn't tell him is that she is married to blackhearted murderer Clinch. I'm not terribly au fait with Seth MacFarlane. I saw Ted, and I know he is responsible for Family Guy (which I don't watch), and he does voices, so I have a reasonable idea of what he's all about, but I don't have much experience of his work. I can't say that I came to this cold, though, because I've seen the trailer about a million times. Not in the west, though.And it's pretty much as I expected - a traditional western-type story, told through modern eyes, and loaded to the gills with gags and filth. As with any comedy of this type (ie. non-stop gags of all sorts - dialogue, character, plot, sight, slapstick, situation, in-jokes), not all the jokes succeed, but enough of them work that the film is funny all the way through.Make no mistake, it is filthy - as well as fairly non-stop swearing, there is also lots of sexual talk (though, as usual with US films, nothing visual) and a moderate amount of toilet-oriented material. Literally. If you are easily offended, do not see this film under any circumstances whatsoever.The film looks gorgeous, making the most of its locations, everyone in it obviously has a lot of fun, and MacFarlane is a pleasing leading man - amiable and sympathetic. There are a handful of cameos, one of which is great fun ( points awarded for identifying the word I nearly said instead of ""fun"").

19,anaconda-40658,Died in the West and On the Screen.,3,15 June 2015,"A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014): Dir: Seth MacFarlane / Cast: Seth MacFarlane, Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, Neil Patrick Harris, Giovanni Ribisi: Disappointing comedy with a title that physically references the various methods to which people die in this film whether it be by gun fight, stampeding bull, or a large block of ice. It also refers to one's self confidence. Seth MacFarlane plays Albert, a sheep herder whose girlfriend breaks up with him for a moustache brandishing businessman. When beautiful Anna strolls into town she befriends him and eventually teaches him how to shoot a gun when a challenge is issued his way. Central plot regards the fact that her husband is an evil gunslinger who shoots on the count of two. It is obvious that Albert will have to get Anna only via gun fight with her husband. MacFarlane turned the formula buddy movie into a creative turn with Ted. While that film is hilarious, this comedy is downright boring and devoid of laughs. There is a creative drug induced dream sequence that works visually particularly with sheep. MacFarlane fails to demonstrate a shred of emotion and is hardly sympathetic. Charlize Theron as Anna draws a quick gun but never generates a personality. Liam Neeson as the villain is all the personality of gunpowder. Neil Patrick Harris as the moustache man is only funny during a constipated showdown. Giovanni Ribisi plays Albert's best friend whose wife is a hooker and will not give herself fully to him. Theme of confidence is a bad leading debut for MacFarlane. It leaves a million reasons to watch Blazing Saddles instead. Score: 3 / 10",A Million Ways to Die in the West

But when she leaves him for the more successful and handsome owner of a moustache grooming store, Albert returns to his lonely daily life of trying to avoid death. Then Anna rides into town and captures Albert's interest and heart, but with her deadly husband in town, Albert is going to have to become the gun-slinger he never was. It won't be easy because there are a million ways to die in the west.....After the huge success of Ted, it was inevitable that MacFarlane was going to physically star in his own vehicle pretty soon after, and here it is, and what a mess the film is.Story and narrative wise, its rubbish, and totally incoherent. It's the old adage of a loser doing good, but MacFarlane doesn't have the Maguffin of a profane bear like Ted, or the length of Family guy, which never outstays its welcome.Here its the concept too, that doesn't work either, 'imagine having genital, excrement, bodily fluid, and sexual awareness jokes, with plenty of profanity, and set it in the Wild West?' Is what I could just imagine MacFarlane pitching, and because of his status, the studio wouldn't have thought it'd be risky.Although the film doesn't work, and is inconsistent throughout, there are a few funny moments. But these moments remind me of the random thoughts that are on Family Guy, hilarious, but have absolutely nothing to do with narrative.And it doesn't help that MacFarlane is highly unlikeable in his role. You are supposed to have empathy for his character, but he he appears to be so smug, you just want to punch him.Neeson is barely in it, and is on autopilot, so thank heavens for Theron, who absolutely steals the film from everyone.Some be though it does have a few funny moments, its a huge misstep for the auteur, and no matter how many cameos, or references to other movies you may have, it can't deter the fact that its poor stuff.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

22,Wuchakk,The best Western comedy ever brought down by juvenile crudities,5,4 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 2014 and written & directed by Seth MacFarlane, ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" stars MacFarlane as a yella sheep-rancher in an Old West town near Monument Valley. While grieving a breakup with his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) he starts a friendship with a hot blonde stranger in town (Charlize Theron), which isn't good because she's secretly the wife of a notorious gunslinger (Liam Neeson). Giovanni Ribisi plays the sheep-rancher's best friend and Sara Silverman his prostitute fiancé. Neil Patrick Harris plays the ex-girlfriend's new beau while Wes Studi appears in the third act. If you can look beyond the vulgar potty humor (with WAY too many d-word jokes), this is arguably the best Western comedy, speaking as one who's seen most of 'em. The characters are memorable, the story is compelling and the dialogues are snappy, all with a quasi-realistic tone offset by absurd humor. I laughed throughout even while I winced or groaned at the puerile vulgarities. Theron is stunning and I'm not even a fan (she definitely got better with age). There are a few notable cameos with a great one involving a barn with a mysterious light; and another one at the very end. The Western locations are of the highest order.Too bad it's nigh ruined by the constant obnoxious non-humor.

23,zetes,"Funny for a while, but it runs out of steam halfway through",6,13 November 2014,"My opinion on this one is much the same as my opinion on Seth MacFarland's last film, Ted. It's fairly amusing, but it never quite gels into anything memorable. This one has the particular flaw that it goes on far too long. It nears two hours, and there's even a director's cut that runs 15 minutes longer than two hours. It really gets bogged down with plot in the last third and isn't very funny. Also, a lot of the best gags - okay, probably all of them - were spoiled in the trailers. A Western spoof, the film follows MacFarland, a dorky guy who just tries to avoid all the horrible dangers of the old West. His whimpiness drives his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) into the arms of the mustachioed Neil Patrick Harris. A new arrival in town (Charlize Theron) attempts to help MacFarland win his girl back, but of course they fall for each other in stead. Theron is hiding the fact that she's married to the territory's most dangerous outlaw (Liam Neeson). A funny subplot involves MacFarland's best friend (Giovanni Ribisi), who is engaged to the town whore (Sarah Silverman), but they're both waiting for marriage to have sex. The film's best moment for me is probably the big dance sequence set to ""If You've Only Got a Mustache,"" which I assumed was an original song but was actually an adaptation of an actual song by Stephen Foster! Darn, I was really hoping for an Oscar nomination for that!",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Seth MacFarlane ambles through a western set cracking jokes with contemporary wit; mostly the usual pop culture references and scatological humor you can expect to see on a MacFarlane TV show. There's even an entire rant on how horrible the west was as a time and place (hence the movie's title).This is an overlong 2 hours of jokes that all land with a thud. It's a a talented cast, but they couldn't do anything funny with the material.

27,StevePulaski,"Boredom could be one of them, for some",6,1 June 2014,"It's 1882 in Arizona, the heartland of the American West. We follow the life of Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane), an incompetent and inept sheep farmer whose girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) breaks up with him because of his glaring lack of courage and skill. Depressed and discouraged by how his life is full of disappointment and how every instance of love is then destroyed and robbed from him, Albert finds comfort in Anna (Charlize Theron), a newcomer to his small village. Albert is attracted to her, initially, by her beauty, but realizes she's the courage and confidence he has always hungered for. However, when the infamous West outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) arrives in town, Albert realizes that he has just intruded on Clinch and Anna's husband-and-wife relationship, and Clinch is hungry for retribution. On the other hand, Albert also has to find the gunslinging skill in order to battle Louise's new boyfriend - the cocky and wealthy Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) - in a shootout in front of the entire town.A Million Ways to Die in the West may not have been the best followup to Seth MacFarlane's monster comedy hit Ted just two years ago. Despite critical/audience reception on the film taking a turn for the worse in recent time, I found that film absolutely hilarious in its brazenness and its levels of romance and heart to be on-point for a raunchy comedy of the modern day. A Million Ways to Die in the West feels like it came about when MacFarlane was sitting around a table with a few of his buddies for dinner and the gang of friends got to talking about how life in the American West must have been hell for the simple townspeople who weren't notorious gunslingers or dangerous outlaws. What they then proceeded to concoct was a barrage of events and downsides to living in one of America's most free and lawless times and what was formed was a satire on the American West life.To be fair, the film has certain merit to it. When the film isn't getting caught up in excessive use of shock humor and gross-out gags and relying on criticizing conventions of the West, it becomes a very funny and often hilarious endeavor. When it, however, resorts to using diarrhea and urinating sheep as it core jokes is when the film becomes a tad insufferable. This is particularly frustrating because we know MacFarlane is capable of so much more than what is presented here.However, MacFarlane excels when the screenplay calls for delivery of lengthy monologues explaining why the West is such a hellhole. Consider the scene that takes place in a local saloon, where Albert is talking with his close friends about how doctors use unorthodox practices, ""modern"" medicine kills and harms more than it heals, there is a new ""disease of the week"" every week, and everything that isn't you in the West wants you dead. This kind of humor is much more low-key and plays different instruments than the abundance of shock humor MacFarlane employs later on in the film. Was he fearful that the humor would be far too low-key and subtle for many to pick up on? Then there's the fact that the film is an unforgivably overlong one-hundred and fifty-six minutes when I initially struggled to see how this film could sustain ninety minutes. Being that it's MacFarlane, scenes drag out, subplots are introduced, musical numbers are introduced, and several little cameos such as the hilarious Bill Maher and Jamie Foxx turn up almost constantly. I am a fan of MacFarlane's rapid-fire style of filmmaking, and I admire this effort for the fact that it has to dodge contemporary pop culture references being that the story takes place in 1882. MacFarlane seemingly used those pop culture references as a cop out for story lines and plot points in his television show Family Guy, especially in the most recent episodes.It's incredible the cast of characters MacFarlane managed to get to partake in this affair. Theron and Neeson partake in some rare comedic performances to a solid effect, and Sarah Silverman as the town hooker works because of her comedic openness. It's hard to believe the weakest performer at hand is MacFarlane himself, who finds ways to overact in many places and can't convey emotions due to his single-facial expression.With A Million Ways to Die in the West MacFarlane creates a mildly-amusing writing exercising that turns into a sometimes funny but often middling farce on western life. The musical numbers are entertaining enough, the performances and the cameos are something to anticipate, and the aftertaste it leaves is not bitter nor offensive; just somewhat underwhelming.Starring: Seth MacFarlane, Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, Neil Patrick Harris, and Amanda Seyfried.

28,KineticSeoul,"I personally at least thought it was better than ""Ted""",4,21 June 2014,"If your a audience member that really enjoys Seth MacFarlane's comedic trademark elements. Than you're probably going to have a good time with this one...Maybe. I will say the movie does have it's moments and does have few slightly witty humor in it. Although most of it, I found to be a dull immature toilet humor that just wasn't funny at all. This flick does feel drawn out after the hour and 20 minutes mark and it just seemed like it was WAY longer than it's running time. If they somehow found a way to cut down this flick to a hour and a half, it would actually be a decent comedy. Even the jokes seemed drawn out and most audiences that has seen enough comedies will know exactly where it's going from the get go. I did like Seth MacFarlane's character in this for the most part and at least found some of the interactions to be amusing. However when it came to the climax of Liam Neeson's character getting involved the character Anna the movie gets really really boring. Who knows if this was a cartoon segment over being a drawn out live action movie, it would have been on the positive list for me. This may tick off certain movie viewers and critics, but I at least found this movie to be better than ""Ted"" which is a movie I just didn't like. Maybe I just need to view both movies again...Which is something I am not going to do.4.3/10",A Million Ways to Die in the West
29,Hellmant,Deserves a lot of points for trying!,8,5 June 2014,"'A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST': Four Stars (Out of Five)Western comedy flick co-written, directed by and starring Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane co-wrote the movie with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild. The same team also wrote multiple episodes of the animated TV series 'FAMILY GUY' and the popular comedy film 'TED', which MacFarlane also directed and costarred in (as the voice of the title character). This movie may not be as funny as either of those but it is original and deserves a lot of points for trying (I think MacFarlane is a great comedic talent)! It costars Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried, Sarah Silverman, Giovanni Ribisi, Neil Patrick Harris and Liam Neeson (as the bad guy).MacFarlane stars as Albert Stark; a sheep farmer who's dumped by his girlfriend, Louise (Seyfried), because she thinks he's a cowardly loser. Albert is so brokenhearted that he wants to move to San Francisco, and leave the dangerous (and horrifically violent) Wild West behind him. His best friends, Edward (Ribisi) and Ruth (Silverman), talk him out of it though (temporarily). When a strange but beautiful woman, named Anna (Theron), comes to town, he begins to have feelings for her (and she seems to like him back). What he doesn't know is that she's married to the most famous gun-slinging outlaw (and killer) around, Clinch Leatherwood (Neeson). When Clinch comes to town, looking for his wife, Albert finds himself in even more trouble. Most of the jokes revolve around the premise that the Old West was really dangerous, depressing and violent. I'd say only about half of the jokes work but I still really like the movie. It's different than most comedies out there; while a lot of the jokes misfire they're still (at least somewhat) amusing and it's got that classic western feel and style to it. The music is reminiscent of a lot of old serious westerns and the film does remind me (slightly) of classic western comedies like 'BLAZING SADDLES' and 'THE VILLAIN'. It's a little too long (and slow in parts) but for the most part it's pretty entertaining. MacFarlane makes a good comedic leading man, the supporting cast is all good (especially Theron) and it's full of fun cameos. I also really like the characters and found it to be pretty sweet (with a positive message about love). It's a mixed bag but definitely worth the watch (in my opinion).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-G3-O3wYgs",A Million Ways to Die in the West

31,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Disappointing comedy from the guy who was all too keen to let you know he was behind Ted,4,13 June 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAlbert (Seth MacFarlane) is a meek sheep-herder, who has just split up from his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) who has taken up with the obnoxious Foy (Neil Patrick Harris.) His life doesn't seem to hold much hope, until he crosses paths with the stunning Anna (Charlize Theron), who has ridden in to town on the run from her evil husband, Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson.) She teaches him to believe in himself and be more assertive...but it's only a matter of time before Leatherwood comes looking for her.Though it has a far more limited cultural relevance in the modern cinematic climate, the western will forever hold an iconic position in the hearts of cinema lovers, simply for the stage they set in the golden era of cinema, and the timeless legacy they've endured. So even in this age, it was still an inspired idea to attempt a send up of the genre, and see how the format would work. Director/star Seth MacFarlane obviously has a soft spot for them, and with expert observation, gets the set up just right, from the opening credits, to the opening voice over narrative and the character set up. Unfortunately, the guy who worked wonders with a talking teddy bear has only managed rather lukewarm results with this disappointing comedy.MacFarlane retains his juvenile love of all things toilet, with all the various flatulence, excrement and sex gags at various points, another effort that those with a sophisticated sense of humour should have dodged like a bullet, whatever the results. However, for all their consistency, they never really produce more than a titter or so, relentless and predictable as they are, the less funny it all is the more it lays it on. And a more coherent, less disjointed story would also have been a benefit, with Theron working on giving our lead guy all the pep talks and encouragement he needs to face his girl's new love in a gun fight taking up too much time, and leaving Neeson criminally under-used and making a belated appearance as the villain. It's also all bogged down with too much tedious melodrama between MacFarlane and Theron, talking about their feelings and trying to give the film warmth and heart, when MacFarlane's cynical, wise-cracking comedy style just doesn't suit it.It can't be said that it's unfunny, and if you get yourself in as facile a mood as you can, once or twice you might even have a few belly-aches. But probably only once, because any more and it might just be a total waste of time. **",A Million Ways to Die in the West

33,bowmanblue,A film of two halves,7,9 December 2014,"Seth McFarland. If you don't know who he is, you really should do your research on his humour before you decide whether you want to watch 'A Million Ways to Die in the West.' And, a good place to start would be his main hit TV show 'Family Guy' or his first cinematic outing 'Ted.' Whichever you choose, you will find some pretty crude humour, making sure that as many people are offended as possible.So, assuming you're okay with that sort of humour, you may want to give his new film a chance. Yes, it's packed full of the same 'style' of jokes, so you'll need to be pretty broadminded to get the laughs. This time, instead of simply voicing a foul-mouthed teddy bear (ala Ted), McFarland plays the leading man – a mild-mannered sheep farmer in the (very wild) west.The first half of the movie doesn't have a lot of story to it. McFarland sort of takes us on a tour of his world. It's basically the same wild west that we've seen in a dozen westerns, only this time McFarland makes it different by appearing like a modern day man, making fun of the time period's clichés. But, although the first half isn't exactly a classic tale in itself, it is pretty funny and I was really enjoying it.Then the second half came. McFarland then falls in love with the wife of the local bad guy. Now he must fight to survive, while at the same time winning her over. Yes, there is a story (hardly inspiring, but a story nonetheless), but the jokes suffer for the plot to get to A to B.Basically, episodes of 'Family Guy' are only just over twenty minutes long. Something that short find it easy to pack joke after joke into it. Even 'Ted' managed to be funny throughout its entire runtime (even if it was effectively a one-joke movie). However, 'A Million Ways...' just doesn't cut it. Fans of McFarland (like myself) will generally enjoy it, so I didn't think I'd wasted my time. It's just the film will never be as successful as much of his other work, namely because it's not generally funny enough all the way through to attract more than die-hard fans.I'd watch it again in a few years time. The jokes will be fresh again by then. Although I couldn't promise not to end up playing with my phone during the second half.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Now this film has a completely different genre, but I feel it doesn't live up to the lofty expectations that Ted has set. That being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The film gives off an authentic western feeling, despite being a Western spoof. There were many, many jokes. Some were great, but others fell dreadfully flat. The cast was mostly great, and I mostly had a good time watching the film. Seth MacFarlane's film is about a man named Albert who has no courage. When a beautiful woman named Anna comes down, he strikes up a relationship with her. But when her gun-slinging husband enters town, Albert must put his newly-found courage to test if he wants Anna and his life. The film has a great cast, no doubt about that. Seth MacFarlane himself plays Albert and he is hit-or-miss. He has better success voicing characters as he did in Ted or sitcoms like Family Guy. However, Charlize Theron was great and beautiful as Anna. Liam Neeson actually played baddie very well. Giovanni Ribisi was good as Albert's sex- wanting friend. I wanted to like Amanda Seyfried, but her acting seemed off. I am not sure if it was her or her character she portrayed. There are also several very amusing cameos that I am not going to spoil. Overall, A Million Ways to Die in the West could have been a comedy classic like Ted was. It's not exactly a big misfire in my eyes, but it didn't meet my sky-high expectations. However, I did find most of the film to be amusing and sometimes pretty funny. I liked the feeling the movie gave off, almost like I was watching a John Wayne movie.

This movie is getting a lot of negative reviews that I don't think it deserves, it may not be Seth MacFarlane's finest work, but he took on a risky project that I think he did a great job with for the most part. The western area looks beautiful and MacFarlane did a great job acting, this being the first film where he plays a character that he does not simply voice, he came across as very confident, hopefully this is not his last live action film role. It did certainly have its flaws, though I found a lot of the film hilarious, some of the humour was lame and immature, such as comstant references to the rarity of a dollar or prostitution, a sequence where Neil Patrick Harris deficates and a lot of death, there were definitely bits that felt unnecessary, that the movie would have been better off without. A lot of aspects to Albert Stark's character were underdeveloped, I think they could have scoped it more, such as his job as a sheep herder, his complicated relationship with his parents and the reason as to why he lives in fear, helping the audience know about the character's life would have let us relate to him more. A Million Ways to Die in the West is an enjoyable and funny movie, fans of MacFarlane's previous work, such as Family Guy, American Dad and Ted should definitely check it out, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.

Overall, his performance at the Academy Awards was very funny (of course, he was out of line with the ""boobs"" number). But, I can only assume -- based on this film -- which was produced, directed, and written by MacFarlane -- that MacFarlane has some repressed sexual issues. Why do I say that? Well, what really is this film about? ""X"", diarrhea, oral sex, prostitutes, ""X"", anal sex, farting (repeatedly), masturbation, ""X"", ""X"", burning people to death, ""X"", bestiality, not to mention that MacFarlane or other characters used the word f--- word 45 times -- that's once every 2.5 minutes. You know, sorta like high school boys in the locker room. Perhaps MacFarlane is the Jerry Lewis of the 21st century -- needs tight direction by someone other than himself.I know what you're saying -- I'm just a prude. Well, not really. It's just that a little bit of all that stuff goes a long ways, and more is not better. Frankly, a lot of it is out for shock laughter, not true humor.The best thing in the film is the spectacular photography of Monument Valley.Seth MacFarlane has a lot going for him, I'd like to see him in a real class act. Charlize Theron is very good here, though not quite as exquisitely beautiful as usual. Amanda Seyfried is very good here. Liam Neeson...well, I just don't care for his acting, but I guess he's talented. Neil Patrick Harris -- another of my not favorites actually does pretty well here. It's always great fun to see cameos -- Gilbert Gottfried as Abraham Lincoln, Christopher Lloyd, Bill Maher, Ewan McGregor, Kaley Cuoco, Jamie Foxx, and others.Did the film make me laugh? Occasionally. Even out loud a few times. There were even segments (such as the Indian drug high) which were inspired. Did I respect the film or the film maker? No, sorry. I respected the Three Stooges and their shorts more.By the way -- the ""X""s above are words IMDb wouldn't let me use, even though I cleaned them up compared to the movie itself.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Acting was OK, cinematography was very solid, music is good, and jokes were good as well (sadly, not all). It's not the ""best comedy ever type"" of a film, but it's a solid one. Actually acting by Giovanni Ribisi and Neil Patrick Harris were a standouts, and Giovanni Ribisi's story in this picture was the most funny.Overall, to enjoy this picture you have to relax, and enjoy the ride.

43,ironhorse_iv,This movie found a million ways for this Western Comedy to die. It really did die in the west.,6,9 June 2014,"This movie is no Modern Day's Blazing Saddles. The jokes for me, is mostly misses than hits to the funny bone. The movie explain all the jokes way too much. The jokes are all the same, anyways. It's about how bad, life was in the Old West. It's so repeatable and time wasting. I was deeply disappointed, by this film. The trailer for this film was so funny, and when watching the film. You can see that most of the best jokes were use in the trailers. What's left in the film is unfunny poop jokes, and random dark humor deaths that run too long or too short. Directed and written from Seth MacFarlane of the Family Guy television show fame. The movie is about a cowardly sheep farmer Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane) who just been dumped by his girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried) as a result of his withdrawal from a fight. Things got better for Albert, when a new girl, Anna Barnes (Charlize Theron) come to town, and found a liking in him. The relationship with her, build his courage up and made him into more of a gunslighter. The only problem is that she is the wife of infamous outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson), whom is now after Albert for flirting with her. Million Ways to die in the West is for the most part; runs a pretty slow pace. The last 30 minutes could had been cut, honestly. It was so padded out. Random sketches lead to nowhere, and too cartoony to be taken serious. While, I give the movie some credit, I love Family Guy and 2012's Ted. MacFarlane is funny at times, but this movie could had been way better. I did like how MacFarlane did do his research for the film, and it was made with lot of heart. MacFarlane, is after all, a lifelong fan of Westerns. He even wrote a novel out of this film. The decision to make Albert a sheep herder was inspired by the film 1950's Montana and his average, non-confrontational demeanor by 1959's 3:10 to Yuma. You can see bits from other Westerns movies here from 1955's Oklahoma! 1962's Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and 1966's El Dorado. The movie even had a few short cameos from other western flicks like Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx) from 2012's Django Unchained and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) from 1993's Back to the Future, Part 3. Also, look for other cameos, throughout the film such as Ryan Reynolds, Bill Maher, and Gilbert Gottfried. None of them couldn't save this movie. All the acting in the film, were great. Seth MacFarlane's best work was in voice-acting, but it's does show that Seth can do on-screen acting as well. Additionally, he has a wonderful singing voice, particularly for crooning and singing show tunes. I was deeply surprise, by the lack of music, here. You would think there would be more songs than the 'mustache'. He's a good actor, it just too bad, the material for this wasn't so good. It doesn't show, his acting chops. He felt like, I was watching a life-action Brian Griffin, type character. Charlize Theron is beautiful and cool enough to be taken serious. Still, it's a bit odd for her, to find a liking to Seth MacFarlane's character, way, way too early. The whole romantic plot seem rushed and botch. Liam Neeson is menacing as Clinch. Honestly, I would love to see him in more westerns. I would love them to focus more on him, than Albert's feud with businessman, Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman were alright in their roles, but for the most part, they play little to no role in the film. The way, the movie is film is both, somewhat beautiful, somewhat horrible. The camera frame was always in a mid-distance shot. It felt like it was a theater piece that a movie. Some of the CGI were just god awful. The whole dream sequence was just a waste of time, and money. The pacing is bad. A week goes very fast. It was really hard to tell, what time, it is. The foul language in the film, doesn't really add, anything. Overall: If you want to watch 'A Million Ways to Die in the West', Gibby-up Cowboys, and go see it. Nothing is stopping you. Just note, that the movie isn't as good as the trailers made it out to be.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
44,The-Sarkologist,"Okay, not Great Though",5,19 November 2020,"I probably can't say that I really did enjoy this film. Sure, it was somewhat cruder than many of the comedies that I have seen in the past, but that seems to be the case with a lot of the comedies that you tend to see these days. Then again, it is a Seth McFarlane comedy, and if you've seen Family Guy, or even Ted, you probably get an idea of what it is going to be about.Basically the film is about this rather nice guy that happens to live on a sheep farm out in the west. He girlfriend decides that she wants to break up with him, namely to have some 'alone' time, which is a nice way of saying that she thinks he's boring, and would rather go out with the mustache guy. Yeah, McFarlane comes across as somebody who really doesn't seem to be all that suited to living in the rough and tumble old west, and the contrast between him, his best friend, and the rest of the inhabitants of the town really does stand out.Still, as I mentioned, it really didn't stand out. That doesn't mean that it was a bad film, but it really wasn't a great film either. The reason being is that it just boiled down to him meeting another girl, who is somewhat tougher, namely because she happens to be married to this outlaw named Clinch, who happens to be played by Liam Neeson (which is somewhat different to a lot of his other characters because here he happens to be playing the bad guy).Of course, we can pretty much plot the course of the film from here, namely that they meet, they get on really well with each other, and then her husband returns and they have to deal with the fact that he really sucks at gunfights, and usually manages to talk his way out of it (which is not going to be all that possible with Clinch).A part of me felt that there was a lot of Blazing Saddles in this film as well, though it has been ages since I have seen it, and I guess that has something to do with with both of these films being off the wall comedies. Actually, it does make me want to go and watch Blazing Saddles again, since as I mentioned, it has been quite a while since I've see it. As for this film though, it was okay, just not something that I considered to be all that outstanding.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

But when she leaves him for Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) the more successful and handsome owner of a moustachery store, Albert returns to his lonely daily life of trying to avoid death. Then the mysterious Anna (Charlize Theron) rides into town and captures Albert's interest and heart, but with her deadly husband Clinch(Liam Neeson) in tow, Albert is going to have to become the western gun-slinging hero he never was. It won't be easy because there are a million ways to die in the west.MacFarlane almost makes a case that in future movies he should be heard and not seen, Theron and Seyfried are both OK, Neeson seems to think he is in a different type of movie, and even Neil Patrick Harris, who normally makes everything better, simply by appearing in it, fails to save this movie. in fact his moustache song was probably my highlight of the full thing, along with him saying his famous catchphrase from ""How I Met Your Mother""",A Million Ways to Die in the West
46,zkonedog,Seth McFarlane's Lampoon Of The Old West,7,3 March 2017,"As with any Fuzzy Door production, there is one disclaimer that needs to be made: Seth MacFarlane has a very specific brand of humor (think Family Guy, Ted, etc.). If you don't like that wise-cracking, making-fun-of-everything style, than stay away from this movie. Stay far, far away. If that kind of humor appeals to you, however, then I think you'll find this an entertaining experience.For a basic plot summary, ""A Million Ways To Die In The West"" centers on Albert (MacFarlane), a sheep herder in the Old West of 1882. As the movie begins, Albert is depressed after losing girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) to the mustachioed Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). Desperate and fed up, Albert is about to head out for San Francisco until Anna (Charlize Theron) rides into his life. The only problem? Anna just happens to be married to Clinch (Liam Neeson), the fastest gunslinger around who also happens to be a very jealous man.The reason this movie works well is that one can tell MacFarlane carries with him a respect for the Western genre. That is what many people do not understand about his type of humor...it is all in fun! It may be mean-spoken, but it isn't mean-spirited by any means. Included in this film are all the trappings of a classic western, from the rousing soundtrack to the period costumes to the stereotype characters. What MacFarlane does, though, is make fun of them all! He has it in particularly for the fact that so many things can kill you in the Old West (hence the title of the film).This movie isn't nearly as good as ""Ted"", MacFarlane's previous effort, mainly because all the really good material seems to be used up about an hour or so into this one. The ending (while still providing a few laughs) is not nearly as satisfying as the setup, where secondary characters played by Giovanni Ribisi, and Sarah Silverman are really allowed to shine next to the primary folk. For that reason, I'd give this an exact rating of 3.5 stars, but I'll bump it up rather than down because I did have fun watching it.It comes down to this: If you like Family Guy and/or Ted, I don't see why this one would appeal to you any less. Not an all-time classic by any means, but just Seth MacFarlane given free reign to lampoon the Western as he sees fit.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
47,Floated2,Offers Laughs Throughout,8,14 March 2015,"A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014) offers a variety of laughs and comedy gags that one would expect from a typical Seth McFarlane directed film. Besides the ubiquity of violent death, Albert Stark (Seth McFarlane has other woes. His self-obsessed girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) has left him for Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), and he's much despised in the 1882 Arizona township of Old Stump for backing down from gunfights. But he finds consolation when the mysterious Anna (Charlize Theron) roams into town and takes a shine to him. Only trouble is that, unknown to him, she's married to the territory's most lethal bandit, Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson). From its opening shots of Monument Valley, with Joel McNeeley's score cheerfully pastiching everything from Bonanza to The Big Country , it's evident that with his second feature (after 2012's Ted ) MacFarlane's set out to deliver on the entire sagebrush canon from a great height. A Million Ways to Die in the West is a solid follow up from his hit Ted, but the main criticism is that it is no Ted, meaning in plot, structure or overall film deliver. Although this film does have a its audience and the cast is well, along with the enjoyment.==================================================================== ====================================================================After a rewatch (08/17/17') A Million Ways to Die in the West remains a funny and enjoyable watch due to the acting and flow of the film.

48,eddie_baggins,A huge disappointment from MacFarlane despite its potential,5,29 May 2014,"See the funny thing about A Million Ways to Die in the West is it's not actually all that funny. Sure there are some very hearty laughs in amongst the mix but for a film that boasts a run time of nigh on 2 hours the hit to miss ratio is worryingly in the favor of the latter. What makes this a funny type of thing is that with the continuing hit that is Family Guy and the box office behemoth that was Ted there were high noon hopes for this venture to the west by polarizing comedian/creator Seth MacFarlane but it seems the man himself has overestimated not only his own talents but the crux of many of his jokes.MacFarlane is unquestionably a funny man but as shown by his somewhat lacking Oscar hosting gig he may in fact be a comedian funnier behind the camera or doing voices than he is fronting a production, especially a production filled with high caliber actors such as Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson. MacFarlane acts as a strange protagonist in the guise of cowardly farmer Albert Stark with his performance neither highly enduring or highly annoying yet his delivery of material and presence on camera frequently feels awkward. MacFarlane's role feels like it should've gone to a more seasoned comedic performer, a performer who would've made questionable material into something more and therefore generate a higher laugh ratio. The other aforementioned actors equip themselves well to what is no doubt a low brow comedy with Theron in particular seemingly having a blast and Giovanni Ribisi on fine from as usual as the hapless in love Edward. While these performers make up ground on MacFarlane's strange role it's also his material that lets the film down.The Western genre has proved itself in times past ripe for the comedic picking in what else but Mel Brooks spoof classic Blazing Saddles and the central premise at play here of the Wild West is one dangerous place is itself equally ripe but MacFarlane over-extends his grasp of what people came to see and instead fills the film with awkward and at many a times badly paced scripting moments that focus far too much on side shows when a more stream lined approach would of worked wonders on the films overall vibe. MacFarlane clearly thinks him romancing a women of Theron's stature is what we came to see, not horribly inventive and over the top Western quips and the films over reliance on smut, swearing and playing to the lowest common denominator can get old and does get old here fast.Watching a Million Ways is like prospecting in old times of the gold rush, you have to pan through a lot of murk and muck to find small nuggets of gold but sometimes the endurance pays off with gems that make you wish for more golden times. There are laughs to be had here and there are some witty plays on the Western genre but overall this is quite a large mis-step by a comedian that has so far ridden a saddled comedic horse to much fame and glory but you sense with this one it may in fact die a million different ways with some lackluster box-office, word of mouth and an overall sense of aiming low and still missing the mark.

At first, I thought it was going to at least be as funny as BLAZING SADDLES (another western comedy that doesn't really hold up after all these years, but that at least boasts good performances by Gene Wilder, Cleavon Little, and Slim Pickens); but no such luck. It bogs down in an uninteresting, clichéd ""love story"" that only detracts from what comedy there IS. (Charlize Theron honed her acting chops with MONSTER; the producers of A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST should've taken her considerable acting ability into account when they had this one scripted.

50,leonblackwood,No were close to Ted! 4/10,4,26 October 2014,"Review: I really had high hopes for this movie, after enjoying Ted so much, but I didn't find it that funny. The storyline was ridiculous and Seth MacFarlane's geeky face and terrible one liners got on my nerves after a while. Liam Neeson seemed a bit uncomfortable in his role as the baddie but Charlize Theron played her part well. It seems like MacFarlane was trying to use cleaner jokes so he would get a wider audience, which was a bad choice, but at least they left in the bad language. Basically, the movie just wasn't that funny and I found it hard to stay interested throughout the whole 2 hours. There are a couple of funny scenes, like when he's drunk, but there not really that amazing. Disappointing!Round-Up: Seth MacFarlane might have peaked to early with Ted because I honestly think that he got a majority of his audience for this film, based on its success. Obviously he had a big audience from The Family Guy and the Cleveland Show, so he was bound to make money from the movie, but if he doesn't come back with the original type of humour in Ted 2, he might have a short lived career on the big screen. He was lucky to get Liam Neeson to play a comedic character, which is out of his comfort zone, and the addition of Jamie Foxx near the end was a great touch, but it still wasn't enough to make the movie enjoyable. Charlize Theron has proved that she is a versatile actor that can take on any project that is put in front of her, but it was the bad script that really let the movie down. Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $86millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedy/western movies about a sheep farmer who falls in love with the wife of a harden criminal. 4/10",A Million Ways to Die in the West
51,Ed-Shullivan,"Congratulations Seth, your film legacy will continue (to grow) for decades with great films like this one! I hope to see many more films from your brilliant team.",8,20 February 2015,"Congratulations Seth, your film legacy will continue (to grow) for decades with great films like this one! I hope to see many more films from your brilliant team.Okay fans and naysayers alike just repeat the movie's title to yourself very slowly.""A Million Ways To Die In The West"". What Seth is making light of with this film is the fact that in reality, back in the 1880's a cowboys life expectancy was much shorter than what we the audience have going for us today. Additionally, for the lovely ladies that appear in the film there is a message as well, if you were not married by the age of 15 your probability of finding a decent man to live your short life with was drastically reduced. Although Seth takes the marriage requirements to extremes as with Anna (played by Charlize Theron) who tells Seth that she was given away in the hand of marriage by her parents at the age of 9 to marry the evil gunslinger Clinch (played by Liam Neeson) who she does not love.The story revolves around a sheep farmer named Albert (played by Seth MacFarlane) whose life has just fallen apart when he declines to die in a street gunfight. His then girlfriend big eyes Louise (played by Amanda Seyfried) breaks up with her cowardly beau immediately after he walks away from the gunfight challenge. And so our sheep farmer Albert is consoled by his good friend the local shoe repairman Edward (played by Giovanni Ribisi) that there is still plenty in his life to look forward to rather than be depressed because his girlfriend has just dumped him. Edward is in love with the saloon prostitute Ruth (played by Sarah Silverman), who even on a slow day screws at least 10 guys, but wants to keep her chastity intact with Edward until after they are married. Go figure? It is at the 12 minute and 50 second stage of the film that Albert explains to Edward and Ruth in the saloon that he is leaving their town of Stumpville (named because there is a huge tree stump in the middle of the town) rather than die imminently from a variety of rare but real causes of death which are then interspersed throughout the film quite comically. For all the negative critics of this film you need to take a reality check. The films purpose is to provide its audience with 2 hours of comedy relief and I for one would recommend for people to see it and take it for what is was intended to provide. If there was a negative comment to make I thought the F bomb was used a bit too often and not always called for. On the bright side we have Ruth's new boyfriend the well to do Foy, (played superbly by Neil Patrick Harris) who runs a men's boutique selling hair and moustache products. Foy's character is a latter day re-imaging of Neil Patrick Harris's character Barney Stinson from the 10 year running television comedy How I Met Your Mother. Foy and his handlebar moustache is a hoot and although the use of human excrement has been overly used for cheap humor in many films, I thought Seth's approach was hilarious.There are a number of great cameo appearances by known actors such as Django's Jamie Foxx, Ewan McGregor, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, Bill Maher's one minute date at the barn dance with a 10 year old girl was very funny, Ryan Reynolds, Mae Whitman, Dennis Haskins and Gilbert Gottfried. Each of their appearances provides a statement that they believe in Seth Meyers brilliance as well and wanted to be a part of this movie's success. A Million Ways to Die in the West cost $40 million to make, and has already grossed $86 million worldwide to date. So for all the negative reviews I have read, money talks and BS walks.Seth MacFarlane I congratulate you for your comedic spin on writing, directing and starring in this Western Comedy film. It is rare for a person to pull off this type of successful triple threat of writing, directing and acting in a film which turns out a profit. We have all seen films that when they first came out were not seen as classics by either film critics or the movie fans. Let's take the classic 1946 Jimmy Stewart Christmas film ""It's A Wonderful Life"" as an example of what I am talking about. As of today February 20, 2015, the film still remains 26th on the top 250 IMDb list, but at the time of its original release was a box office disappointment. I believe as the years pass us by, and Seth MacFarlane's body or work extends to many other facets beyond animation, comedy and westerns, A Million Ways to Die in the West will continue to grow in its popularity and through time Seth MacFarlane's fan base will challenge and eventually surpass the popularity of Mel Brooks body of work both in ratings and more importantly in box office revenues.As a footnote, Seth MacFarlane in real life was provided an incorrect flight time by his travel agent for his flight departure on September 11, 2001 due to a mix-up, and as a result missed his flight which ended up being the first plane that was crashed into New York City's twin towers in one of the greatest disasters of world history. There is more than A Million Ways to Die in the West, and I don't know if Mr. MacFarlane subconsciously was thinking how his life was spared on this terrible day for the world's people, but Mr. MacFarlane thank you for bringing humor into this so serious world. As for you naysayers, read the film's title very slowly once againA Million Ways To Die In The West.I rate this comedy western classic a strong 8.4 out of 10.

I detest Family Guy, I categorically refuse to see Ted and as a whole I'm not a fan of Seth MacFarlane. The only reason I decided to see this film is that the trailer looked promising, like it was going to be one of those dark comedy gorefests, which I do like.And yeah, there's some of that in here, mainly in the fair scene, which was pretty much spoiled to me by the trailer, so I didn't really get to see anything new. And admittedly there were some other funny jokes. Not a whole lot, but some. Unfortunately the rest of the jokes revolved solely around bodily extracts, horny people and the fact that human beings are pretty disgusting when looked at in a certain light. An uplifting and/or intellectual comedy it is not.Add actors that don't seem to care about what they're doing, a serviceable but unimaginative script, lackadaisical score and some decent Western style sets and you have a movie that is not awful, but which still falls pretty far behind average.If you like Family Guy or Ted, then you should enjoy this one just fine. I've heard that it's not as good as Family Guy, but I can't really judge that because I have seen so few episodes. In any case it's a comedy for those that can laugh at all kinds of humour.

You can buy your creams, your gels, your combs and your trimming tools, all for mustaches, all in one store.

Even though, when you work it out, he couldn't have possibly been there, even if the two universes collided, and time travel was possible.

58,freemantle_uk,A Comedy of Two Halves of Quality.,7,25 June 2014,"Directors like bands and singers are susceptible to suffering a second album syndrome, as they success leads to them having more free reign and see them receive less of an objective advice. After the success of Ted, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane made a bigger scale film with his follow-up A Million Ways to Die in the West.The Old West was terrible place to live where people risk death from other people, wildlife, the weather, disease and injury. Only the tough can survive, and unfortunately for sheep farmer Albert Stark (MacFarlane), he is a coward and after being shot by his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) she breaks up with him for a successful moustached man, Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). But all is not lost after he strikes up a friendship with Ann (Charlize Theron) who offers to help him win her back.A Million Ways to Die in the West is a comedy of two halves. The first half is a constantly funny comedy, using strong verbal, physical and gross-out comedy to supply laughs. The second half becomes more reliant on more cruder humour as the story itself runs out of steam.Ted worked taking the fun childish fantasy and twisted it into a stoner comedy. A Million Ways to Die in the West is a more traditional story of a man trying to win over his dream girl when he is blind to a better girl that is already there: it just happens to be set in the Old West. MacFarlene does show his affection for the Western genre, using bright cinematography and desert locations, the set dressing and costumes and its score which are all reminiscent of classic Westerns, just with more swearing, sex and violence.MacFarlane surrounds himself with a strong cast, featuring the likes of Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman, having fun as a Christian Couple saving themselves for marriage despite Silverman playing a popular prostitute. Theron's strength was supplying a deadpan performance, working off the more overt humour of the other characters and the strange location of Old Stump. Most of the cast was strong, but some actors suffer bigger indignities then others. MacFarlane also eschews some fun cameos who provide some great moments A Million Ways to Die in the West has strong first hour, that was consistently funny for the most part and features some of MacFarlane's risqué humour. But this was a film that needed a rewrite for the second half as it drags its down. It should have been a shorter, tauter affair.6.5/10 Please visit www.rocknreelreviews.com",A Million Ways to Die in the West
59,stevendbeard,Dark Version of Blazing Saddles,7,30 May 2014,"I saw ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"", starring Seth MacFarlane- Movie 43, Tooth Fairy, Oh yeah, he is also the creator of the t.v. show Family Guy and the movie Ted; Charlize Theron-Prometheus, reindeer Games; Amanda Seyfried-Red Riding Hood, Veronica Mars_t.v.; Neil Patrick Harris-How I Met Your Mother_t.v., Undercover Brother and Liam Neeson- The Taken movies-of which #3 is filming now for a 2015 release-, The A- Team_2010.This is a funny comedy about the old west, sort of like if Mel Brooks were to do a darker, more graphic version of Blazing Saddles. Seth plays a cowardly, pacifistic sheep herder in 1882 Arizona. He is dating Amanda but she breaks up with him because he is just too dull for her. She takes up with the local mustached Neil-mustaches were very popular during this time period, they even sing about them-and so Seth falls into an even deeper depression than he already was in. He was pretty bummed out about life in general, how there are so many ways to die in the old west. Diseases, drunks with guns, killer preachers, killer doctors, wild animal life such as snakes and wolves, irritated Indians, ...Well, you get the picture. Just when things seem that they can't get any worse, Charlize rides into town and befriends Seth. She helps him with his self confidence and teaches him how to shoot a gun. Which is fortunate for Seth since Liam, the baddest outlaw and gunfighter in the territory, shows up looking to kill someone. There are several cameos that you may need to keep an eye out for; they were usually in the crowd scenes and usually had one line of dialog. There is a scene as the end credits first start and there is also one after the end credits, with both of them involving the same cameo actor. It's rated ""R"" for language, violence, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

61,GiraffeDoor,One of the greatest comedies in years,8,23 March 2019,"It's so hard to find a good comedy.I'm not exactly picky when it comes to finding something to watch but so much comedy is diluted with some attempt at drama or is just gross or just reliant on zany scenarios.Macfarlane has hit a home run with this fine comedy movie which is not just good comedy but a fine piece of story telling.Authentic or not, the vision of the old west in enchanting, nostalgic and brutal. It's not as aggressively dark as Family Guy can be but it doesn't white wash anything.I love Macfarland's lovable loser character and seeing him move deal with losing the woman he thinks he loves to the snooty rich guy is a very satisfying narattive with, for once, a very believable romance with two independently developed characters where neither is desperate court the other from the offset but where their relationship develops gradually and I can actually root for this non-arbitrry relsationship.It's sense of humour is thoughtful, creative and irreverant and on top of that there is a real feeling of love for the vintage westerns.I'm so glad Macfarlane is part of popular culture. Even in person he is a treat to watch and listen to.It's gets a bit gross at times and I wish they had toned down the racism of its characters, but I choose to look past that as it's so rare to see a real comedy.There's even a song!",A Million Ways to Die in the West
62,estebangonzalez10,It could have been so much more...,5,30 July 2014,"""I'm not the hero. I'm the guy in the crowd making fun of the hero's shirt; that's who I am.""A Million Ways to Die in the West is a comedy that fails at so many levels, but since I had gone into it with low expectations I wasn't really disappointed by it and found some of the scenes extremely funny. On paper this should have been the year's best comedy because it had an excellent cast and an interesting premise. MacFarlane proved he could direct a comedy in the big screen after the success he had with Ted (which I liked, but wasn't blown away by). The first major issue I had with the film was that despite its Western setting it never felt like any of the characters belonged to this world. My second issue was with Seth MacFarlane's performance. He is a funny man, but he is good at writing and doing voice work, not acting, and that was a major flaw in this film because he was one of the main characters and the way he delivered some of the jokes fell flat. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about this comedy was that every time they were trying to get the story going and forcing some dialogue scenes they would try to add a poop or fart joke in there somewhere. It was way overdone. I can see how people might have been disappointed with this considering it had so much potential, and despite not liking this film I didn't think it was as terrible as many people claimed because at least it had some funny moments. Still, this is a rotten film and barely enjoyable because it's full of flaws and way too long.Seth MacFarlane is talented doing voice work and writing some great jokes, but he has some problems with the delivery (something we saw when he hosted the Oscars a couple of years ago). He really hurt this film considering the rest of the cast was pretty funny. Amanda Seyfried, Neil Patrick Harris, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, Charlize Theron, and Liam Neeson all give some funny performances and deliver a few laughs. My favorite moments were definitely the cameos (there were some great ones that had me laughing really hard, but I won't spoil them), and I also enjoyed the surprising death scenes and found them kind of hilarious. Maybe I just have a weird sense of humor, but those scenes worked for me. The rest of the film is just overlong and a bit tedious with several jokes that fall flat, making me feel the same way as the townspeople after hearing MacFarlane trying to deliver jokes and avoid getting killed during the duels: dead silence.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
63,Fluke_Skywalker,Overstays its welcome,6,9 December 2014,"Writer/director/star Seth McFarlane's non sequitur brand of humor has never really appealed to me. There are laughs to be found in 'Family Guy'/'American Dad' and 'Ted' to be sure, but it's always felt cheap and lazy. Here he keeps that tendency in check--mostly--and for the first two acts 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' is a surprisingly amiable and occasionally hilarious comedy.Unfortunately it's at least 20 minutes too long, and by the third act it completely loses its focus and winds up limping to the finish line with all of its good will exhausted. With a bit of polish and some trimming, this could've been a highly re-watchable guilty pleasure instead of a disappointing time-waster.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

This was a good spoof of Westerns as a cowardly sheep farmer talks his way out of a duel, gets dumped by his girlfriends, mocked by her new beau, and then meets a mysterious new woman whom he falls for. He is then pursued by a nasty gunslinger. This movie features good songs and dances, hilarious lines, terrific cameos, great scenes (including Sarah Silverman's ""whore scenes,"" the dance scenes, and my favorite cameo-I won't give it away), and good spoofs throughout.

65,jimbo-53-186511,"Oh dear Seth, what were you thinking?",2,25 August 2015,"I'm not a massive fan of Seth MacFarlane - I find some episodes of Family Guy to be enjoyable and I also liked Ted & Ted 2, but there was something very much a miss about A Million Ways To Die in the West...First and foremost is that, for the most part, it lacks any real imagination. MacFarlane & Co seem heavily reliant on sight gags here and I noticed whilst watching this that very little humour comes from the actual characters themselves. The only sight gag I found funny was The Back To The Future one. It seemed to lack much of the wit that we've seen from MacFarlane before this film and after it. MacFarlane is well-known for sailing close to the wind with his jokes, but some attempts at humour were either uncomfortable to watch (the girl that's clearly underage who's going round dating older men) to a misguided, offensive and tasteless joke about rape - I've got a broad sense of humour but making a joke about rape is taking things too far.MacFarlane's character Albert was also annoying; a whiny little dweeb of a character who remains like this for pretty much the entire running time (and I watched the 130 minute uncut version - more fool me). His bleating and self-pitying just really got on my nerves and as such I felt nothing for him as a character. Despite my annoyances with MacFarlane's character some of the other cast members such as Theron, Harris, Neeson, Ribisi & Hagen do at least try and have some fun here and make the most from what they have to work with. Which brings me neatly on to my next point, what exactly did they have to work with? The 'story' here was virtually non-existent consisting of the laziest and most clichéd of plot lines; I was bored by Theron and MacFarlane's blossoming romance (possibly due to how unconvincing it was). I also felt the same way about Harris and Seyfried's romance - although again it's a case of 'boring characters in boring situations'.MacFarlane and co seemed to inject 'historical information' (I'll use that term loosely as I'm unsure how much of it is true) into the film every now and again which to me felt like it was only there to pad out the running time as very little of it had anything to do with what 'story' there was here.AMWTDITW also seemed to have no cohesive narrative and felt like a random string of set-pieces with random Family Guy type inserts thrown in here there and everywhere. The bulk of the plot revolves around MacFarlane becoming a sharp-shooter in order to take on his ex-girlfriend's new fella, but the resolution to this aspect is one big poop joke and is disappointing to say the least. Thankfully the showdown between Neeson and MacFarlane is much stronger and much more clever and it's just a shame that these high points were so few and far between.I think the main problem here is that it never seemed clear what MacFarlane was trying to do here; it isn't clever enough or obvious enough to be a good parody or satire, it isn't funny or imaginative enough to be a good comedy and the characters aren't likable enough to make the drama aspect work. As it is, it's a largely unfunny sequence of cheap sight gags and humour of the lowest common denominator. I suspect that even the most forgiving of MacFarlane fans are going to have a hard time liking this one.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

67,3xHCCH,A Good-Natured Western Satire,7,1 September 2014,"I have not seen much of ""American Dad"" or ""Family Guy"" animated series which he created for television. I also have not seen his first major foray into the silver screen, as the voice of Mark Wahlberg's libidinous teddy bear Ted. With ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"", the talented comic Seth McFarlane makes his debut as a bonafide leading man in a motion picture.""A Million Ways"" is about Albert Stark (Mc Farlane), a genteel sheep farmer who is not cut out for the rough and violent life in the American West in 1882. After his lady love Louise (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him for a rich mustache salon owner Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), Albert meets and falls in love with the skilled gunslinger Anna (Charlize Theron). Unfortunately, Anna just happened to be the wife of the notorious outlaw Clinch (Liam Neeson).Despite its tendency to go overboard with the disgusting toilet humor, gory violent humor and gross-out sexual humor, which I believe are trademarks of McFarlane humor, I have to say that this film still remains really funny in a most charming way. I think it has its talented cast to thank for this. McFarlane's fresh clean cut looks and awkward charm are perfect for fish-out-of-water Albert. Charlize Theron is gorgeous here as Anna, the windswept outdoorsy look becomes her. The two of them had an effective chemistry going for them. Neil Patrick Harris is as irritatingly funny as his arrogant mustache. Liam Neeson was so sinister and mean, which makes his scene with a daisy simply hilarious. In addition, there is chameleon-like Giovanni Ribisi and the irrepressible Sarah Silverman gleefully playing the ironic Christian couple -- the shy virgin Edward and the popular whore Ruth.The cinematography capturing the breathtaking vistas of the New Mexico desert was noteworthy in its brilliance. The country-style musical scoring had a sense of humor. That square dance number to the song about mustaches was rollicking fun. The costume designs and production design was meticulous for its period, even though many parts of the script's language was not. The screenplay had so many potentially offensive references which fly fast and furious in the witty repartee, but the cast's amiability and bright smiles somehow make them forgivable in the name of a good time. There are a couple of unexpected cameo appearances of characters from other films which add to the fun mix. I had a really good time with this good-natured satire of the Western genre.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
68,JoeKarlosi,A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014) ***1/2,9,1 June 2014,"I went into the theater with no real familiarity of Seth MacFarlane's previous work (he wrote, directed, and stars in this movie). I just went because I thought Charlize Theron looked delicious in the trailer, and I wouldn't mind a couple of hours of light comedy, if this was done right. So, harboring no prejudice against MacFarlane, I was thoroughly entertained by this very good Western farce, which I consider more or less ""BLAZING SADDLES for the 21st Century"". Yes, the movie was done right... it had a good amount of funny moments, even if MacFarlane relied too often on typical modern toilet humor and sexual gags. However - he redeemed himself with a script that also offers some strong characterizations and a love story amidst the chuckles.Seth MacFarlane looks like a misplaced Peter Brady in the role of Albert, a fish out of water living in the Old West of the 1880s, and whose sensibilities are more suited to our own modern world. His troubles adapting to ancient frontier life become even worse when his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) dumps his poor sorry ass and she hooks up with the mustached Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), who is the town's rich and prominent store owner. Taking matters into his own hands, the incompetent Albert desires a gun fight with Foy, but can't shoot to save his life. So when a pretty and experienced cowgirl named Anna (Charlize Theron) arrives in town, she befriends Albert and sets out to teach him how to handle a gun. But Anna has troubles of her own, since she has an estranged jealous husband (Liam Neeson) who's out looking for her, and also happens to be the most feared and dangerous gunslinger of the West.The cast acquits itself nicely, beginning with MacFarlane and Theron, but also Harris and Neeson as the two villains. Sarah Silverman is perfect as the town whore who'll have casual and sloppy sex with everyone except her own boyfriend. We also get some fun cameos from Gilbert Godfried and Jamie Foxx. If the movie would have toned down the notch on at least some of the obligatory sleaze humor and substituted more clever jokes in their place, this would be perfect. The music and theme song were well done. All I know is, I had a good time at the movies and walked out feeling fine.

72,aidanratesmovies,"Consistently entertaining, but often lazy and not very funny",5,30 April 2020,"Incredibly juvenile, formulaic, and often forced- A Million Ways to Die in the West can make the best of its absurd premise at times, but hardly often enough to carry an entire film for nearly 2 hours. The film feels very dragged out, and even more, the humor is often forced and incredibly necessary at times. It seems there was more dedication to putting lazy written jokes in the film as much as possible, than actually trying to attempt something more humorous, and/or more satisfying. The acting isn't great, obviously this is no Oscar worthy performance film, but Charlize Theron does give her best as Anna in the film, and can provide for some smile worthy moments. The film is moderately and consistently entertaining throughout, but it does tend to feel like it's just a bunch of gags on a string at times, rather than having any true plot or storyline. The gags often become tiresome, and the execution of them are often pretty poor. The film does have some much well executed cameos and references that are quite enjoyable, but nothing to truly make the film itself memorable itself. Instead the film focuses on whatever joke, laugh, and punchline it can get its hands on, without it ever succeeding at anything truly hilarious. It was about what I had expected going in, but even McFarlane fans know that he is better than this. It has some good moments layered without, even a bit of heart towards the end, but it feels more tiresome than truly enjoyable, and is quite a vastly empty film of unused potential. It can be lazy, but also somewhat entertaining, its visuals are nice, but its delivery of gags seems to forced to be truly funny.

73,Amari-Sali,One man's life in the west becomes brightened immensely when the wife of an outlaw comes to town and changes his life dramatically.,8,1 June 2014,"Though controversial, it is hard to say Seth MacFarlane, with his R- rated Looney Tunes style of comedy, doesn't have his moments. For while this may be one of his first in which he physically is starring, he has shown through Family Guy, and public appearances, that he isn't against giving you the idea that anything can happen and no subject maybe taboo. Which for A Million Ways to Die in the West, makes for a seriously slapstick, and borderline ridiculous at times, movie. One which doesn't try, like its contemporaries, to pair an arguably deep story with a slew of jokes, but more so focuses on the laughs and a good enough story to help deliver them.Characters & StoryOut in the west, around the year 1882, lives a man named Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane) who is far from rich. He is but a simple sheep farmer who barely does his job well. But, despite this, he has a decent life. However, one thing that seems to be alluding him is the love of Louise (Amanda Seyfriend), a wannabe débutante. For this woman Albert seems willing to do anything, but being that he doesn't have the type of money Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) has, Albert ends up without his girl, and has only the shoulder of best friend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) to cry on.But, slightly luckily for Albert, not too long after Louise dumps him comes Anna (Charlize Theron). She is a bit of a tomboy, though a romantic at heart. One more than willing to look past Albert's faults and see this sweet guy who maybe could make a good husband. Something which she doesn't really have in Clinch (Liam Neeson) who is a regional outlaw/ bandit who everyone fears.Well, except Anna to a point. For while Clinch is out terrorizing some town, Anna finds herself spending an immense amount of time with Albert trying to prep him for a duel with Foy, over Louise. Somewhere along their training though, Albert and Anna begin to fall for one another, and Louise gets a tad turned on by how bad ass Albert is getting. Leaving us to wonder, between Louise seeing Albert in a new light, and Clinch willing, and ready, to take out the man messing around with his wife, will Albert forsake Anna just so he won't experience one of the million ways to die in the west?PraiseIn total, I laughed about 48 times over the course of this movie, which I find weird because the jokes were never really that complex, but you can see MacFarlane was looking for any which way he could to get the audience to laugh. Be it physical comedy; dirty jokes; racial jokes; through cameo appearances, like Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) showing up; and the occasional insightful joke about how strange it must have been to live in the west, each scene he tries to give you a good laugh, and lets just about every character try to win you over. Which they do.Of course though, Albert takes lead by doing most of the aforementioned type of jokes, but then comes Foy who matches wits with Albert through a dance number, a mustache obsession, bad puns, and through Harris using the line ""Challenge Accepted,"" in a Barney-esque way. As for the others, they also get their little niche, or moment to shine, as well. Edward and Ruth (Sarah Silverman) have the strangest relationship for he plays this straight-laced square, who is in a very committed relationship to a woman who sleeps with a minimum of ten men daily, on a bad day. But, what makes that duo so comical is how Silverman plays up her usual quirks, as Harris does for Foy, and somehow adapts them to the times. She is a would-be church girl, who doesn't want to sleep with Edward before marriage, and yet she eagerly has sex for money. All the while being this sugar sweet girlfriend who Edward sometimes wipes the cum off of.Though the best part, to me, was the cameos. Be it Gilbert Gottfried as Abraham Lincoln, the aforementioned appearance of Doc Brown, or even Django, this movie presents itself as a film in which anyone can show up, and anything can possibly happen.CriticismWhich compensates for how dull the story can be at times. For while I will give props to MacFarlane for sort of flipping the usual romantic trope of a guy changing a girl's life and making it so the girl changes the guy's life, outside of that, everything here seems very basic. What makes matters worse though is MacFarlane tries to make Albert sympathetic and deep, in terms of his insecurities, but when you mentally compare this to the other comedies which seek to give their characters some depth, MacFarlane's attempts seem underdone and forced.Overall: Worth SeeingThis film, for me, is right on that border between being ""Worth Seeing"" and ""TV viewing"" with the jokes being what push this toward being ""Worth Seeing."" However, if this film wasn't as funny as it was, it would undeniably be a ""TV Viewing"" type movie because there isn't a lot of strong points in the film. The story is adequate, and while I like how they developed the relationship between Albert and Anna, at the same time it only made for a decent distraction while you waited for the next joke. So, considering a minimum of 48 laughs, that is why I am saying this film is ""Worth Seeing.""",A Million Ways to Die in the West
74,jadepietro,"Bad, Let Me Count the Ways",3,14 October 2014,"This film is not recommended.According to comedian and filmmaker Seth MacFarlane, there may be A Million Ways to Die in the West, and he sure knows how to kill many of his jokes repeatedly in his unfunny movie with the same moniker. Subtlety and good taste evades him. He takes his sweet romantic comedy and send-up of the Western genre about a sheep rancher schmo named Albert who falls hard for a beautiful sharpshooter and peppers the story with smutty frat-boy sex jokes, dumb mean-spirited slapstick, and gross-out shock humor, all under the guise of comedy. It just doesn't work.Let's discuss why. First and foremost, as an actor, Mr. MacFarlane has zero screen presence. While his line delivery is good, his leading man status is nil. He comes across as smug and smarmy. Secondly, as a writer (abetted by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, he continually overstates his jokes and relies literally on potty humor with close-ups of urine and human excrement to make sure the moviegoer ""gets it"". The anachronistic modern day references, smutty double entendres, and non-stop f-bombs and profanity grow tiresome and rarely shock due to their overuse. (A PG rating, really?) The numerous attempts at slapstick veers into ugly violence with much of the film's sophomoric humor involving semen, sex, and farting. (Not my taste, I assure you.  I'd rather see the infinitely superior Blazing Saddles or Cat Ballou if I want to see a funny satire or romantic comedy about the Wild West.)However, MacFarlane's skill as a director are more evident, especially in a hallucinatory drug- related sequence that has some fine surreal moments and a nicely staged barn dance number. His casting choices are also strong with a talented crew of skilled performers like Giovanni Ribisi, Neil Patrick Harris, Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, and Sarah Silverman in supporting roles. Particularly strong is the performance of Charlize Theron as Anna, Albert's interest. The actress is so endearing and charming in her role.  She seems to be having a truly better time than we are having watching this film. Some jokes do work, but it is completely due to the actors involved and not the source of the script. The material is just so weak and self-depreciating that the end result seems more desperate than funny. Too bad MacFarlane, as a director, has yet to learn that less is actually more.Writer, director, and actor, Mr. MacFarlane is a triple threat indeed, but not in a good way. This non-Renaissance man needs some judicious editing, common restraint, and better decision-making when filming his next project. There may not be a million reasons to avoid A Million Ways to Die in the West, but there is at least ten dollars worth of reason not to pay the admission or streaming cost of this film.

75,Seraphion,The practical jokes are funny indeed,6,8 June 2014,"The movie focuses on Albert, a, weak shepherd in the Old West, who has his life as one misfortune after another. After being humiliated in a gunfight, and losing his girlfriend Louise to a more sophisticated and wealthier man Foy, Albert meets a newcomer girl in town, Anna. At a fair, Albert gets himself heated and issued a gunfight challenge to Foy, who is more a masterful gunman than he is.

On the eve before the duel, Albert, and Anna meet Louise and Foy on a dance event and after that Albert kisses Anna.

It turns out that Anna is the wife of a notorious gunman Clinch, and one of Clinch's men report the kiss to Clinch. Clinch seeks for Albert but he escapes, as Anna suggested him. But Clinch threatens to kill Anna if Albert doesn't return. In the middle of his confusion Albert is captured by an Indian tribe. Before he is being set on fire, Albert talks his way out. Turns out, Albert is fluent in the tribe's language. The Indians give Albert a drug that enables him to look within himself and find his own courage. He then goes back and meets Clinch, where ultimately he challenges Clinch on a gunfight. Albert, having told by Anna of Clinch's sneaky habit of shooting on the count of two while before he said at three, Albert shoots Clinch at the count of one,hitting Clinch but nowhere fatal. Clinch retaliate by shooting and disarming Albert. Realizing his fate Albert stalls for time, and Clinch dies out rattlesnake venom that Albert previously had soaked his bullet in, all while Albert is still explaining about his ingenious trick.The base story is sooo lame, having being repeated maybe some hundred times in many movies of many genres. But I bared the movie out of curiosity at the promising high end class cast names on the opening credits, a traditional craft that typical western movies do. And yes, the development of the story still doesn't lift it's value from lame. The protagonist is even being degraded from the ones in the typical westerns, that of either cool, wise and a precise shooter, or a reckless, loud mouth shoot- then-talk gunslinger, to a stupidly weak and sloppy shepherd who never doe any hard action before in his life.The movie is overly forcing to put common era jokes into an Old West time frame, the execution of the practical jokes are superbly great. The dialogs are being washed up so bad that they don't sound like any comedy happening in the Old West era, let alone like any typical western movie, but they sound like a lame stupid third class common era theater about set in the Old West time.Although I must also say that the development and execution of the practical jokes are greatly done. The comedic scenes of the death by ice, the unshaven sheep, and the Indian language surprise are done well. The joke of the poop hat is personally my favorite. It's done in a great sequence by the great Neil Patrick Harris. And also it transitions well into the dramatic part of the story. The end joke of talking to long is also greatly funny due to it being a surprise. Also, the DeLorean cameo is quite a nice surprise for me.The acting is quite a as expected for this caliber of a cast. But that's just it, not more than as expected. Well, I guess, Seth McFarlane kind of lost his edge in doing the verbal comedy in a western time set. As I said before, the dialog is especially done very wrong as a western, the accent play is stupidly scarce amongst the main characters. The speech speed and fluently is strangely too fast for people in that time.The music tries so hard to be a western, having a big band orchestration on every suitable moment it gets. The only missing music score piece is the lonely flute tune before the duels, that usually do the trick to heat up the tension before duels. The costumes are being done well. They succeeded in focusing on the characters of the main casts.From me, 1 6 out of 10 score is what this movie's worth, just out of the stupidly funny practical comedic moments. A recommendation is a yes from me, just don't prioritize on this one if there are other good movies you haven't seen yet in the cinemas.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

77,rgkarim,"Another MacFarlane comedy, Theron rocks it",5,31 May 2014,"The days of the Wild West movie have become scarce, with only the occasional director up to the task of returning to the rugged frontier. It seems that chasing bandits, riding horses across the plains, and surviving Native American attacks are no longer popular, replaced by a sea of romantic comedies and big budget book remakes. My second review this weekend goes back to the world of the 1800's, though not in the way nostalgic fans like my grandpa expect. Yes I'm talking about Seth MacFarlane's latest creation A Million Ways To Die in The West, and boy is it an interesting project. For those who haven't seen the trailers, this tale is about a coward named Albert (MacFarlane) who hates the desolate cesspool the West is at the time. After breaking up with his girl (Amanda Seyfried) and describing plenty of ways to die out in the desert, Albert plans on moving out of the town, only to be pulled in by the newcomer Anna (Charlize Theron). Interested once more, Albert soon finds himself in a gun standoff where his chances of winning are nil, and must be guided by Anna's tutelage to secure victory. What hilarious antics will ensue? In MacFarlane's world, there are no limits, which we saw with Ted, and this movie is no exception. From the very start, MacFarlane acts like a fool, stumbling around, both physically and in his words, trying to get a laugh. His material is very similar to his cartoons, filled with offensive references, racist jokes, and curse-laden sexual innuendos you haven't heard a million times already. What started out funny soon became stale, for MacFarlane takes a dead horse and mercilessly beats it into oblivion. MacFarlane has a variety of comedy styles blended in this movie, but often he takes a joke too far as he grinds into your face without relent. For me in particular, the sexual stuff was the material that failed the most, often presented in some fashion that was a bit over the line, i.e. semen on the face, or a full front view of a sheep's penis. Once again the lack of restraint in R rated movies allows his writing to get lazy, no longer clever, or witty as his TV shows are filled with. Yet some of his talent still remains amidst the cheap laughs, often executed in just the right spots for maximum laughter. However, the best part of the movie for me is Theron. Her character Anna is a center point for this shell of the story there is, and the most balanced of the cast. Anna has morals, a conscience to balance the darker secrets she holds, as she teaches Albert the ropes of life. Surprisingly MacFarlane and company wrote some touching dialog, and integrated a few life values that served as good lesson and helped develop her character. Yet the blonde beauty is also funny, delivering well-timed jokes without overacting or over emphasizing the lines, plus the girl has got skills in stage shooting. Theron does all of this so naturally, and was a fantastic pick for this well designed character. The combination of great acting and a great character is why I loved her so much, plus her gorgeous looks didn't hurt. What about the rest of the cast? Seyfried is okay, her character merely a ploy to drive Albert's actions as the remnants of her Mean Girls' days shows itself. Liam Neeson brings his Taken voice to the game, using the steely stare to deliver some imposing threats to help get the village shaking, though he is not in as much of the movie as you might think. Giovanni Ribisi is still awkward as ever, playing the innocent virgin whose naivety and child like manner provide some interesting comedic moments. His lines have a little more creativity behind them, but they were not too impressive for me, and would have been worse had Sarah Silverman not been partnered with him. Finally the legendary Neil Patrick Harris wraps up the cast. Fans of Barney will love his character, the cocky ambiance radiating from Foy and his prop mustache. NPH had me laughing most of the time as he brought all his talent, including singing and dancing, to the Wild West, adding spunk and pizazz to a rather bland world. He plays the rival so well, and thankfully, wasn't forced to spout out sexual innuendos or curse like a sailor. The writers allowed him to be his self, and it fit so well into McFarland's world. There isn't much more I can say about this movie. It's a western comedy from one of the dirtiest minds in Hollywood. The movie is filled to the brim with stupidity, making this film one for just a stress reliever or an outing with your friends. If you are a die-hard fan of MacFarlane I recommend you see this movie, but otherwise save your cash for future movies and rent this on RedBox. My scores for the film are:Comedy: 6.0 Overall: 5.0",A Million Ways to Die in the West
78,Galina_movie_fan,Albert: I'm not the hero. I'm the guy in the crowd making fun of the hero's shirt; that's who I am.,5,2 June 2015,"""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" uses the scenery, camera work, and soundtrack that are too good for such crude, rude, raunchy, tasteless affair as Seth MacFarlane goofy western –parody. Somebody said already that the world did not need the whole two minutes of Neil Patrick Harris's manifestations of the upset stomach and public defecation in somebody's hat not once but twice. The joke about a virgin guy in love with the town prostitute who would not have sex with him before the wedding was funny once (barely) not ten times. If MacFarlane had taken it easy (ier) on the jokes involving farts, pissing sheep, crude sexual references , etc, and decreased running time from 116 minutes to, say, 90 or 85, the movie might have been much better and funnier. There are a million ways to die in the west. Dying from constant laughing while watching this movie is not one of them. With all this said Albert's (MacFarlane) drug-induced trip close to the end is truly wonderful, creative, funny scene that re-invents the word ""surreal"". He deserves a credit for casting Charlize Theron as the female lead, Liam Neeson as the devious villain, and Neil Patrick Harris as the pompous mustached mustachery owner. It is always nice to see them on the screen, and they seemed to enjoy making fun out of the weird situations and the fools out of themselves. There are million ways to spend your time during the weekend, and Steve MacFarlane's western-parody comedy while, certainly, not the best of them, is not the worst.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
79,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of A Million Ways to Die in the West,5,30 May 2014,"If you enjoy the sight of Liam Neeson's arse having a dandelion stuck in it, Neil Patrick Harris defecating into a couple of cowboy hats (and having the camera pan down to show a ton of poop), and the constant sight of horse dung, then by golly this is the movie for you. Yes, Seth MacFarlane is at it again. He did a fine job hosting the Oscars and managed to make the aggressively funny Ted. Here he strikes out with 2014's wild wild west spoof, A Million Ways to Die in the West. You see his 2012 release Ted pushed the envelope with a forced crassness that truly worked. With his latest release however, he doesn't get a whole lot of laughs. ""West"" is vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, crude for the sake of being crude, and gross for the sake of being gross. There is virtually no humor in the screenplay. The result: the jokes fall flat as pancakes and you as the audience member, start to look at your watch and nod your head in disbelief. MacFarlane, acting as star, director, and producer here, gets on a mini ego trip trying to do what the Zucker brothers did with Airplane (spoofing air travel and airports) and the Wayans brothers did with Scary Movie (spoofing the horror genre and every other genre for that matter). He fails most contingently with a fine cast (Oscar nominees/winners Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson who deserve better) and tired jokes that actually render things a little boring (""West"" is probably 20 minutes too long).Containing an obligatory musical score lifted from every single Western (known to man) and featuring a lingo of dialogue by which no human being would ever speak in the late 1800's, A Million Ways to Die in the West follows a whiny, down his luck sheep farmer named Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane). As the proceedings begin, he loses his girlfriend to a wealthy mustache shop owner named Foy (played by Neil Patrick Harris who provides the film's only real chuckles). Stark complains that the town he lives in is plagued by disease, murder, and death in general. When he befriends a new town resident named Anna (the stunning Charlize Theron), he is smitten with her. They become close, form a relationship, and ultimately fall prey to Theron's character's evil husband (Clinch Leatherwood played by Liam Neeson). This plot thread just mentioned, somewhat deviates from the general ""so stupid it's funny"" element thereby making ""West"" a sort of black comedy that doesn't quite gel. As things get closer to wrapping up, Theron's Anna teaches Stark to become a great shot so that he can eventually confront and kill Leatherwood. Everyone can live happily ever after and Stark can avoid leaving his small Arizona town in order to move to San Francisco.Now the acting is fairly decent but certain characters seem to belong in a different flick altogether. Liam Neeson's Clinch Leatherwood is a prime example. He plays effectively, the outlaw or villain if you will. But there is nothing goofy or humorous about his performance. Everyone around him seems to carry a different tone. They are all playing for laughs while Neeson is gruff and out of place. As for MacFarlane, he's not a bad actor but doesn't quite have the chops to really carry a whole film. His Stark is ill-defined. It's as if he came from a different century or era. Heck, he talks about his gun slinging town as if he entered from the future and was stuck in some unforgiving time warp. All in all, he should probably just stick to doing roles like the voice of the despicable teddy bear from Ted. He brings the funny so much more when reading from a microphone in a sound proof booth.Ultimately, this is a redundantly flat and uneven comedy. I didn't get the humor in the 1974 classic Blazing Saddles (of which this film was clearly inspired by) and I sure didn't get the humor in what's featured here. Bottom line: A Million Ways to Die in the West possesses about ""a million ways"" not to make you laugh. Just call it one of 2014's weakest entries so far.Of note: (spoiler alerts) if you choose to purchase a ticket to this unfunny monstrosity, watch for the ending in which MacFarlane's character wins some reward money (in a gun-fueled shootout) and uses said money to buy thousands of sheep for his homestead (he's a lousy sheep herder so this makes no sense whatsoever). Then there are a couple of meaningless cameos in the form of Jamie Foxx (showing up obviously as a nod to his role in Django Unchained) and Christopher Lloyd (looking like he's 1000 years old) reprising his role as Doc Brown from Back to the Future. Their scenes are just plain arbitrary and too short to register.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
80,brando647,Another Guilty Pleasure; an Under-Appreciated MacFarlane Gem,8,21 March 2015,"A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST is my guilty pleasure of 2014. Man, this movie took a critical beat down when it arrived in theaters that summer. But I'm an unapologetic fan of Seth MacFarlane. I love his TV shows and I thought TED was hilarious. A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST is his brand of humor transplanted over a hundred years into the past where he can poke fun at a point in time often romanticized in the movies as being full of adventure. It's a movie loaded with MacFarlane's trademark humor and a cast that is obviously having an awesome time making the movie. The movie has some pacing and tonal issues that I figure might've led to some of the negative reactions, but I've been able to overlook them and find endless enjoyment in the gags that populate the movie from start to finish. The movie focuses on the character of Albert Stark (MacFarlane), a cowardly sheep farmer who's in love with the beautiful Louise (Amanda Seyfried). When Albert is humiliated in a gunfight, Louise decides it's time to break off their relationship, sending Albert into a serious funk that his best friend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and Edward's prostitute girlfriend Ruth (Sarah Silverman) can't break him from. That all changes when Anna (Charlize Theron), a woman with a mysterious past, arrives in town with her trouble- making ""brother"". When Albert finds himself engaged in another gunfight, Anna offers to train him in the art of gun slinging so he might just survive.You should understand that this is no BLAZING SADDLES. It's not so much a parody of the western genre as it is one man's diatribe against all the inaccurate perceptions of life in the Old West from classic movies. Seth MacFarlane wants you to know just how horrible it was back then and he spends the first half hour of the movie ranting and raving on the subject. When the movie isn't lecturing (humorously) about the horrors of the West, it's loaded with toilet humor so, you know, this isn't high class. Sheep genitals, diarrhea, and all the jokes that come with having a prostitute character in a Seth MacFarlane film. To be honest, I wasn't impressed with the movie when I saw it in theaters. It was fun(ish) but it was no where near the level of TED. I've watched it a few times since and I've found it actually gets funnier every time. I don't know if I'm just catching more nuances in the performances or little minor gags I might've missed previously, but I've come to really like the movie. The jokes are juvenile but they hit more than miss, and it looks like everyone involved in this movie is having a total blast making it. I thought MacFarlane made for an effective comedic leading man, showing he can be more than a cartoon voice. And his chemistry with Charlize is surprisingly good. She's an Oscar-caliber actress and it's odd enough seeing her in a movie like this but she is incredible when paired with MacFarlane. Every laugh sounds genuine and you actually believe when she starts to fall for Albert. Speaking of reeling in the major talent, MacFarlane scored Liam Neeson as the film's villain, Clinch Leatherwood. Clinch isn't much of a stretch for Neeson seeing as how he's already one of Hollywood top tough guys but at least he gets to go full Irish. There's even more star power when you account for the cameos. MacFarlane must've called in a load of favors for this one. I'm not going to spoil them here but some have been shown in the trailers, some you probably won't see coming, and some you might miss if you aren't paying attention. There's just so much I like about this movie and I'm always finding something newwhether it be a line, a character moment, a subtle joke that might've slipped by before. There's a lot of vitriol for A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST but my only complaint might be that the pacing is a little screwy. Because (at least of my first viewing) the Clinch Leatherwood plot seemed to be the primary, it took forever to get to the story and it felt as if the movie had stalled out. Once I realized that Clinch is just a minor plot device in the overarching story of Albert and Anna, and Albert finding his courage, it all sort of fell into place and I've never had a problem watching it since.A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST is one of the most under-appreciated movies of 2014 and I hope it's fan base grows a bit more once people have had more chances to re-watch it on home release (especially the unrated cut). In the meantime, I know I'll be revisiting it often and hoping MacFarlane sees fit to revisit the genre again in the future.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
81,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Contrary to the generally less-than-stellar reaction, I found ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" endlessly charming and amusing.",7,16 November 2014,"Seth MacFarlane is just one of those people. I don't always like his humor, yet I find him quite charming and amusing. (And a darned good singer, oddly enough) I often feel his storytelling is flawed, yet I find myself generally enjoying his work to at least some extent.So I went into ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" with a fairly open mindset. I didn't have any pre-conceived notions for better or worse, especially given the rather mixed opinions I had previously heard, which ranged from ""I loved it! Really funny!"" to ""Dreadful and humorless.""Thankfully, I'm pleased to report that my views mainly fall into the former category. Despite some serious flaws and truly hit-or-miss humor, I found the film quite enjoyable. Sure, it's not a comedic revelation, nor is even a particularly strong entry in the comedy- western sub-genre... but I found it endlessly charming, generally likable and frequently amusing. Even when I wasn't laughing out loud, I at least had a big, goofy smirk on my face.MacFarlane stars (in addition to directing and co-writing) as Albert Stark, a jaded sheep-farmer living in the old west. With very little respect from his town due to his profession and frequently cowardly ways, he spends his time lamenting his very existence, especially after his beautiful girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) leaves him for suave moustache-shop-keeper Foy. (Neil Patrick Harris)However, things take a turn when he meets Anna (Charlize Theron), a gorgeous woman who recently moved to town. Quickly striking up a friendship, Albert and Anna grow fond of each other, and Anna helps Albert begin to lighten up and embrace life more. However, what Albert doesn't know is that Anna is actually secretly the wife of a ruthless outlaw (Liam Neeson), who will complicate matters when he comes to claim her.Now, to get it out of the way, I do have to admit that the film has a lot of problems. It takes a good 10-15 minutes before it really ""gets going"" and hits a stride (in both humor and pacing), so I can see it losing some audiences in the first act. And the film is definitely ""MacFarlane"" in terms of humor- a lot of oddball jokes, really raunchy (even darkly raunchy) humor that sometimes goes too far, weird cutaway gags, and quirky musical numbers. And it's not for everyone. MacFarlane's brand of humor is pretty divisive, and I think this film is a prime example of how hit-and-miss it can be, as there are often periods where jokes feel misjudged, out-of-place or just seem to go too far.However, I think the saving grace of the film is two important factors- a great cast and some genuinely wonderful visual direction courtesy of MacFarlane. The cast is a lot of fun. Everyone does an admirable job with the material, and they all gel together well, elevating the sometimes questionable content. MacFarlane is cool, quirky and funny, and his schtick (he almost comes across as a modern-day guy stuck in an old- fashioned world) is always amusing. Theron is a blast and is gorgeous, and has a good chemistry with MacFarlane. And supporting roles by the likes of Neil Patrick Harris, Liam Neeson and Sarah Silverman are are good dose of plain-old fun. And I found the film very well-constructed. While I may not be the biggest fan of MacFarlane's last theatrical outing ""Ted"", both films have shown that he has a pretty darned good visual sense and style. It's a gorgeous looking film, and his storytelling in terms of composition, movement, lighting, etc. is top-notch.For me, this is a good ""dumb fun"" film. I enjoyed the heck out of watching it. My friends have pretty much all enjoyed the heck out of it. Heck, even my 50-something mom found herself laughing constantly at it. And that should say something- despite some mixed reception, a lot of people who go in open-minded are loving it.I give it a pretty good 7 out of 10. You just might find yourself dying when you see this film with the right mindset... dying of laughter.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

83,Screen_Blitz,A million ways to be unfunny,2,8 January 2015,"A million ways to die in the west starring Seth Macfarland, was an utter disappointment. This movie was short of laughs and used almost every clichéd joke that many people heard over and over again many times. The movie doesn't even take much advantage of its R-rating. The movie instead uses an excess of scatological humor such as fart jokes, urine jokes, and penis jokes and the results are always unfunny. The film is a comedy set in 1882 in old west where Seth Macfarland plays a cowboy who must come face to face with a ruthless gunslinger played by Liam Neeson. Along the way, he falls in love with the gunslinger's wife played by Charlize Theron. The movie fails deliver good laughs, the jokes used by the characters are yawn-inducing, and the script is just...................plain awful. One scene features Seth Macfarland's character hides in a herd of cows only to get urinated in the face, another scene involving cows dancing and peeing everywhere, and a later scene featuring a man using a cowboy hat to defecate. The movie just constantly uses gross-out humor and in the end, it's just not funny.I recommend this movie to only die-hard Seth Macfarland fans.

84,cricket30,Better TED than Red . . .,8,5 June 2014,". . . as South African native Charlize Theron substitutes for Seth MacFarlane's Teddy Bear (and exactly WHAT part of Charlize did Seth sing about seeing during his lone Oscars roast?). Like any good Western gal, Charlize keeps her clothes on and her guns out during her many scenes in A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST. MacFarlane plays an ultra wimp, lacking both a mustache AND gun skills, the two key ingredients of survival for Western males. Filling his movie with on-purpose anachronisms and jarring contemporary cameos, MacFarlane pulls his fat out of the camp fire with one liners, such as ""somehow the sheep had made twenty bucks!"" There may be no ""Mongo"" to sucker punch a horse, but BLAZING SADDLES' weenie roasting scene pales by comparison to the gross excess of Neil Patrick Harris and the strangers' hats. That the ""Runaway Slave"" county fair midway shooting gallery proprietor will meet DJANGO UNCHAINED probably is a foregone conclusion for most of the audience.

85,Troy_Campbell,Just not particularly funny.,5,2 June 2014,"This western spoof from Seth McFarlane (creator of Family Guy and box-office smash Ted) has two major flaws. To begin with, it asks the audience to believe that a mug like McFarlane could snag both Amanda Seyfried and then a smoking hot Charlize Theron. If you can suspend your disbelief enough to get past that, there's still the broader, more crucial problem to contend with: this comedy is just not that funny. With belly laughs you can count on one hand (including an admittedly hilarious moment of juvenile toilet humour featuring Neil Patrick Harris), a large portion of the film's runtime is made up of gags falling just shy of the mark or sequences that are surprisingly joke-free. Like Ted, there's an underlying message to be found – here it's one of not selling your self short – and McFarlane admirably attempts to create a few serious moments based around this idea, yet it's only mildly successful and unfortunately a tad dull. Where A Million Ways really gains back points though is with the top-notch cast: McFarlane proves he can do more than just funny voices in his first physical acting role as cowardly sheep-farmer Albert, Theron is seductive and tough as cowgirl Anna, Liam Neeson sneers up a storm as the snarling gunslinger Clinch, Patrick Harris is suitably pompous as the moustache-loving businessman Foy, Giovanni Ribisi is sweetly naïve as Albert's bestie Edward and Sarah Silverman is game for anything as a hooker with a heart of gold.

88,Stephen_A_Abell,Not So Wild West - Not So Funny Either.,5,28 February 2017,"This is one of the many movies where the trailer is better than the film because it eradicates all the superfluous parts, which in this instance is a lot.The concept of the story should have allowed for a variety of humour but once again the writer decided to stick to puerile adult toilet humour. Don't get me wrong, I like this kind of humour and some of it does make me guffaw, though I find many ""Comedy"" films are relying on it too much and this commonplaceness turns it stale.Seth MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin, and Wellesley Wild, also seem to run out of these type of jokes and try to extend them until they become cringeworthy and dullened. The point in case being Giovanni Ribisi's character Edward and his relationship with his fiancé Ruth, played by Sarah Silverman. Edward and Ruth are truly in love and are waiting to get married, in the eyes of God, before they celebrate their love conjugally. The problem being that Ruth is a whore in the saloon, who does the best business in town. This conflict is funny when first used, though by the third time it's starting to wear thin, then it just isn't funny anymore. These writers know how to kill jokes (another way to Die In The West).However, credit where credit is due, the planting of the flower is pretty funny.Though some of Seth MacFarlane's jokes fall short his directing skills are pretty solid as he does more than a decent job throughout.There's some serious acting talent in the film, though I do feel as though the characters could have been a little stronger. The main bad guy, the gunslinger Clinch, played by Liam Neeson, doesn't come off mean enough. He should be somebody to be scared of but he isn't. Charlize Theron, who plays Anna, should've been a lot tougher than portrayed. The west was a savage and dangerous place and she was Clinch's woman. The only characters which come out of this film correctly are Seth MacFarlane, who does a decent act as the cowardly farmer, who doesn't farm, Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman who do well adding a depth to their characters. Even though Neil Patrick Harris does a decent job with the character of Foy, it does seem to be very similar to other characters he's portrayed - and the moustache song... really(?) Though, the decent acting ability and direction cannot make up of the dullness of the script, missed opportunities to be funny, and overused and tiresome jokes.Unless there's nothing else worth watching I would stay away from this dud of a movie.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
89,maurice_yacowar,sheep farmer finds love in modern parody of the western,7,30 May 2014,"As the narrator intones, some people are born into the wrong times. That's Albert Stark (Seth Macfarlane), a sensitive, psychology-aware sheep farmer who finds himself in Arizona in 1888. His modernity inflects everything else in this splendid parody of the classic western, especially the profanity, the historic awareness, the struggle to sustain moral codes, and the surprise cameos (e.g., Bill Maher as a frontier standup comedian, etc.). Stephen Foster meets Freud in the barn dance valorizing of the moustache.The situations are everywhere informed by modern understanding. ""Why are the Indians so mad?"" one character asks, ""We're splitting the country with them 50-50, aren't we?"" A shyster's magic elixir contains cocaine and red flannel. The hero's discovers The Way through an Indian drug.The film's basic premise is the essential absurdity of the human condition, seen most clearly in the short but constantly threatened life span on the 19th century frontier. The film draws laughs from the variety of deaths to which our flesh is heir. Hence our nobility in carrying on, whether in the adjustments we make to our romantic failures or in marshalling courage under pressure.On the romantic side, Stark suffers from being dumped by his unworthy girlfriend Louise (Armanda Seifried) but finds true love in the unlikely arms-training of Anna (Charlize Theron), the wife of the vicious gunslinger Clinch (Liam Neeson). She married at nine to avoid being a spinster at 15. So too the pragmatic propriety (aka hypocrisy) in the Christian relationship between the whore Ruth (Sarah Silverman) and her fiancé Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) from whom she withholds all sex until marriage.On the courage side, the sheep farmer tries modern negotiation strategies to make up for his inabilities in the classic macho skills. Those having failed, he succeeds through the arcane knowledge he collects both as a nerd and as a friend of the natives. The film is very clever in its comic invention and in its replication of the classic Western's tone. The music evokes the Dmitri Tiomkin scores. The Monument Valley setting recalls John Ford, with the further hint of a raised third finger here and there on the horizon. Alan Jackson's rousing ballad at the end articulates the film's theme with the spirit of Frankie Laine at the end of Blazing Saddles, this film's true muse. I expect that for some viewers Seth Macfarlane is, like Mel Brooks, an acquired tastelessness. For me he, like Brooks, epitomizes sophisticated wit. Here as in Ted Macfarlane's project is to let his well-meaning, put upon hero make it as a man by sustaining his sensitivity in the face of overwhelming coarseness (the West here, like the teddy bear in Ted). Finally, it's fun. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
90,phubbs,A Million Ways to Die in the West,4,9 October 2014,"So this would be Seth MacFarlane's own comedy western version (or should I say attempt) of 'Blazing Saddles' or 'City Slickers' with his trademark Family Guy tomfoolery all in an uneasy marriage. The movies title does sound intriguing that's for sure, hell its actually a great title...but it could also be summed up quite easily in a 30 minute TV episode or maybe even a comedy sketch. This really is a one trick pony I'm afraid.The plot isn't worth discussing as it simply involves MacFarlane playing the useless underdog against a rough tough cowboy and his band of merry men. In the middle is the blonde damsel in distress played by Theron who naturally falls for MacFarlane as things proceed and we make our way to the inevitably predictable stand off at high noon. Its the basic western theme with the basic western setups and scenarios along side the reasonably amusing notion of how easy it was to get killed in the wild west...briefly touched upon in places.The film just felt like a spin off from Family Guy, almost like a live action version with 'Brian'. As MacFarlane provides the voice of Brian in his animated show it just feels like you're watching Brian in the wild west. The comedy plays out exactly as it does in Family Guy, you get the plot interspersed with the odd joke or visual gag that may or may not have anything to do with the plot. For instance right in the middle of the movie MacFarlane's characters stumbles across a barn and finds 'Doc Brown' working on his Delorean. Now I will admit its a nice little visual moment and both Christopher Lloyd and the car looked great...but its completely off the wall and had nothing to do with the actual movie!...just like MacFarlane's animated show.I really must stop comparing this movie to that animated show but you understand its very hard. The humour is of course as you would expect with lots of toilet gags and slapstick, lots fart and poo gags, much sexual references, sexism, racism, black humour, offensive bits...and then there's some good old fashioned lunacy and visual jiggery pokery. End of the day its quintessentially MacFarlane, you either love it or hate it which isn't necessarily a bad thing but you just feel like its dated already. There are some things in there that did make me laugh...or at least giggle, some good lines of dialog here and there. Overall most of it misfires, seems childish amateurish or just plain dumb admittedly but there are still some accurate strikes from the comedy bomber. I liked the spiel about old fashioned photo's and folk never smiling, the various ways people could die back in this era, the bad state of medicine at the time and the way Ribisi's prostitute girlfriend casually acts about her career.'shoot that dirty cowboy cum all over my face!!'One thing the film does have and that's stunning location work. The movie really does look superb at every turn with the eye popping New Mexico backdrops. Some (most) of the acting scenes are outdone by the incredible landscapes we see behind the stars. Its far more interesting to look at the rugged desolate beauty of nature instead of Theron and MacFarlane trying to shoot bottles or MacFarlane trying to chat up Theron. Seriously am I the only one who thought that? is it me or is this guy clearly trying to flirt with Theron in some of these scenes? we all know he wrote himself the best part of course. Oh and what's with all the pointless non-dialog cameos? just because he could get these big names?I get that MacFarlane has tried to make a sort of old fashioned western comedy mixed with his own unique blend of humour here...the classic credit fonts, the obligatory meeting with Indians, the old clichéd good guy coming up trumps in the end routine after dealing with moustache twirling enemies (literately) and dirty dark coloured attire wearing bad cowboys etc...I think we all knew it would be a satire and parody of sorts...but I guess everyone just kinda thought it would be funnier or a bit more ingenious than just sh*t jokes.MacFarlane is clearly not a leading man, I don't think anyone had the balls to tell him this. He ain't got the looks, he ain't got any sort of physique and strangely enough he can't quite pull off visual tomfoolery (neither can Theron, comedy ain't her thing). He does have an excellent voice though and that's his best weapon, we don't need to see you MacFarlane, just hear you. The movie looks outstanding in almost every scene no doubting that, the idea had promise, there are some good bits...but generally this feels like a very scattershot affair. The lighting has not been bottled here, hit and miss, now get off your high horse MacFarlane.4.5/10",A Million Ways to Die in the West
91,aciessi,A Million Ways this Film could have been Funnier,5,31 May 2014,"""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is Seth MacFarlane's second venture onto the silver screen. After the monumental, half-a-billion dollar success that was ""Ted"", audiences and critics were convinced that Seth was made for the movies, and in some ways, that is true. The misconception would be that he is capable of doing no wrong, because folks, I believe we've encountered his first major stinker. ""A Million Ways"" is an ambitious, beautiful looking movie, but it lacks very much in laughs. This is a big problem. ""Ted"" was constantly funny, even in times when the jokes landed flat. ""A Million Ways"" alters between broad comedy, drama and romance. It's inconsistent. The conclusion that I am resorting with is that Seth wanted to make a loving homage to Sergio Leone, Buch Cassidy, Mel Brooks and Woody Allen all in one goofy package. But that would mean that he is taking the material way too seriously. and that shows dramatically throughout the majority of this film. ""Blazing Saddles"", for example, was a broad comedy through and through, never taking a break in order to create a true western picture. Seth MacFarlane probably wants you to think that he is a Mel Brooks in the making, and that this movie is a 21st century answer to ""Blazing Saddles"". If he really wanted to pull that off, he should have never backed away from making an entirely broad comedy. Granted, if he did, I would have accused him of making a rip-off of ""Blazing Saddles"", but that is neither here no there. As far as other positives are concerned, the cast is terrific. Everyone here gives it there all and provide terrific comedic timing. I also enjoyed the surprise cameos (which I won't give away here). I guess the positives outweigh the negatives somehow. But it works vice versa. I guess you can say this is a flawed movie. A good movie is buried underneath all the junk, I know there is. Perhaps a healthy edit should have been made to the movie? I'm not entirely sure. I guess Seth MacFarlane is better suited for modern day satire. Which in that case, I guess we'll all have to wait for Ted 2.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
92,Hollywood_Yoda,"Very Raunchy, Somewhat Funny",8,20 June 2017,"Seth MacFarlane wrote and directed this film, a very raunchy, yet sometimes funny comedy western. Sort of like a modern Blazing Saddles, but even Mel Brooks wouldn't have appeared! One of the best moments is an homage to Back to the Future, where Christopher Lloyd appears as his iconic character, Doc Brown, complete with the time machine and his famous catchphrase, ""Great Scot.""MacFarlane's acting could have been much better, as it seemed he really wasn't even trying. As for Giovanni Ribisi, he was not too bad, his character, like himself, was flawed. And Sarah Silverman's character was terrible and disgusting, more so than needed! Neil Patrick Harris played an arrogant, self centered person, and he was great. He stole the scenes he was in, especially the gun fight in the street, too hilarious. Liam Neeson did a great job too, even though I'm not particularly a fan. His deep Irish accent was a great touch.Overall, it wasn't a terrible film, it will make you laugh, especially at inappropriate times. That's what Seth MacFarlane lives for! Not for anyone too immature, but just a little.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
93,Quietb-1,Another comedy western classic?,6,31 May 2014,"Blazing Saddles set the bar high.Seth MacFarlane deserves all the credit and all the blame. Comedy is subjective and not everything works. There are plenty of laughs, but most of the best jokes are in the trailers. Some of the trailer jokes didn't make the cut. One joke was so bad the star had to walk back into frame to explain it. The pace is choppy and the movie works best when it is moving along.MacFarlane acts like he is trying too hard. Liam Neeson was distracting as the too unlikeable violent villain. Amanda Seyfried and Sarah Silverman were under used. There are a couple of great cameos. Charlize Theron holds the whole movie together and provides someone to watch during the many slow points.The location photography is a highlight. The music is fun and appropriate. There is an award contender song over the end credits.Lower your expectations and see it in a theater. It will benefit from a big screen and a shared audience experience.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
94,bankofmarquis,Hang through the beginning and you'll be entertained,7,24 January 2015,"I like Seth MacFarlane's humor. I really enjoyed TED, so was a bit apprehensive when reviews last summer of A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST was less than positive. So apprehensive, in fact, that I ended up waiting until it was out on DVD to watch it.The first 15 minutes, or so, of this movie seemed to confirm my worst fears - MacFarlane was trying too hard to make the BLAZING SADDLES of our time. His jokes came out of the gate too hard - almost jarring - and were missing the mark badly. However, I am not a quitter. I'll stay with almost any movie through the end.And I'm glad I did with this one.At about the 20 minute mark - just about the time Charlize Theron shows up on screen - the movie seemed to find it's footing, and it's sense of humor and I found myself very entertained.Sure, there is quite a lot of poop, penis and pubes jokes - more than my tastes prefer - but between them there is a warm sincerity on the story of the town loser winning the best lady and saving the town from the bad guys.MacFarlane is just fine in the lead, but it is in the supporting characters - the aforementioned Theron, Neil Patrick Harris, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman and a perfectly cast Liam Neeson as the bad guy - that this film finds itself. MacFarlane throws in quite a few in-jokes, cameos and even a musical number to keep the action moving along briskly to a very satisfying conclusion.If you haven't seen this, I would recommend you check it out. Just make sure you make it to the half hour mark before deciding whether this one is for you.It was for me.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",A Million Ways to Die in the West
95,rzajac,I loved it!,9,12 June 2014,"Yeah, yeah; it's getting lacklustre reviews, and I half understand why.It's not a timeless piece of comedy, but it's got spunk, wonderful production values, inspired comedic acting (even the 'bit' roles), and it has well-turned moments of stunningly genuine romance. Of note: If other comedy films are ""better"", why did I find more good ol', down-home belly laughs in this one? I think I know why: Sure, MacFarlane can play it blue and scatological, but he also values that other timeless comedic tradition; that which is Truly Funny Because It Is True.Special Mention for Sarah Silverman. I think she struggles to reach out and touch with her unique and beautiful style, and goes largely unappreciated. MacFarlane gave her a great vehicle, and she lived up to it with the kind of aplomb and vivacity that I've certainly come to expect from her. I sincerely hope moviegoers will recognize this and watch her career with heightened expectations.One thing I thought a bit odd: The Onion reviewer's main critique was that MacFarlane was ""recycling"" gags. I was half-expecting to find a tiresome rehashing of a few gags. I started watching, and found it engaging and surprising.Anyway, it sorta looks like the horse is out of the barn. The flick did sh1t at the box office, and it'll go to DVD and maybe recoup its outlays. Too bad! It deserves better.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
96,Ruskington,Successful satire and laughs aplenty,7,11 September 2020,"While Seth McFarlane does have a tendency to jam his jokes down your throat at times, I still found this movie to be one of the few genuinely funny films of the last decade. The dry wit is relentless and it's all encased in a very pleasant Western backdrop. The Doc Brown gag is particularly good and I loved Giovanni Ribisi's performance. The satire genre has become withered in recent years so it was nice to see an attempt that actually delivered.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
97,spookyrat1,I'm About to Shoot a Full Load!,7,25 October 2019,"A Million Ways to Die in the West is not Blazing Saddles, but as a 21st century homage to the great Mel Brooks classic, it's not a bad effort and well worth a watch.On the debit side, there is no doubting it's a good 15 minutes too long. This is not the sort of movie that needs to be 2 hours in length. Much of the extraneous stuff occurs after Anna has been snatched, in the lead-up to the final gunfight and the pace begins to flag somewhat.It should be said too that some of the jokes fall a bit flat. The movie is not a constant laugh-a-thon. Having said that one has to add, that there are jokes of all varieties and shades in here. Everything is tossed into the mix. Satirical sketches, one-liners, heaps of sight gags, songs, dancing (both people and animals), hilarious, very appropriate and unexpected cameos. No one could ever accuse Seth McFarlane of not giving something a go.For a film of this type, it was greenlit with a relatively large budget and it shows. This is a fine looking film with great location cinematography in New Mexico and vey realistic sets.The cast is just plain impressive and you just feel they had fun making it. Special mention needs to be made of Charlize Theron in a part she was born to play. Besides being extremely cool as usual, she is both sexy and funny and proves again, she is one of those actors, that can just about play any type of role. From this film she went on to steal the acting and thrills credits from everyone in Mad Max: Fury Road and you can see why here.Liam Neeson, complete with his normal everyday Northern Irish accent has huge fun, playing the story's arch-villain, Clinch. As mentioned above watch out for the numerous cameos. They are brilliant, when they come, even when somewhat disembodied. And for dog lovers, the hound who plays Plugger has no lack of canine charisma.In spite of the title A Million Ways to Die in the West is a feel good movie for broad minded people. You'll be guaranteed to feel good after seeing it.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
98,bob-the-movie-man,Silence and Tumbleweeds not included,4,10 June 2014,"Comedy westerns have a strong legacy through classics like Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Support your Local Sheriff/Gunfighter"" (with James Garner), ""Paleface"" and ""Son of Paleface"" (with Bob Hope and Jane Russell) all the way back to the brilliant ""Destry Rides Again"" (with James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich). Unfortunately for each of these classics there's the odd ""Wild Wild West"" to restore movie western Karma, and Seth Macfarlane's follow on to ""Ted"" – ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" – is on that other side of the scales.Macfarlane aside (who really isn't funny enough to take the leading role of the sheep farmer Albert) the rest of the cast is bordering on stellar featuring Liam Neeson, Sarah Silverman, Amanda Seyfried and the gorgeous Charlize Theron. And they work very hard at it: Theron occasionally laughs like a hyena (to cover the fact that normally we are not) and Neeson plays the straight man villain very straight indeed.So let's accentuate the positive for a moment. The photography of the Utah locations is gorgeous. Joel McNeely's western score is sumptuous (gotta love a western soundtrack) and the songs (including the moustache song and the title song) are both catchy and suitably ridiculous.And there are moments in this film that are genuinely funny: Sarah Silverman's Christian hooker with a heart who is ""saving herself"" for her husband-to-be, played by the excellent Giovanni Ribisi (Frank Buffay Jnr in ""Friends""), while servicing 10 of the locals (""on a slow day""); shooting practice with plates and a doctor's blue woodpecker for the aftermath; the Navajo translation for ""fine"" being ""Mila Kunis"" and – most surreal of all – Albert's drugged up trip with moustache wearing dancing sheep.There are also some amusing cameos, particularly one in a barn (don't watch some of the trailers that cheaply give it away).But the bits that did make me really laugh were few and far between. A lot of the jokes fall face first into the dry Utah dust with the humour similar to Albert's aim: scattergun. The script stoops to swearing at every opportunity (because that's always funny isn't it?) and whilst toilet humour can work in moderation you need to know when to stop and when to leave something to the imagination. I'd like to suggest that this was a self-written, self-directed over-indulgent piece by Macfarlane, given carte blanche to indulge, and over-indulge, by studio execs after the runaway success of ""Ted"" – - but he did have co-writers who could and should have balanced his content more (Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild – I haven't actually checked that these don't make an anagram of Seth Macfarlane).Comedy movies need to have good material across the whole running time, which means the films need to be tautened until the material 'twangs' along its whole length. This was not one of those films.(If you enjoyed this review, please check out my other reviews on bobmann447.wordpress.com, and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"".

99,bryank-04844,"'A Million Ways To Die In The West' is largely funny, but lacks the character development and connectivity that was available in MacFarlane's previous effort.",5,17 August 2015,"Seth MacFarlane is back with his second directorial effort with 'A Million Ways To Die In The West'. His first film, 'Ted', which was a huge box office success, netting in almost $600 million from a budget of only $50 million, pretty much guaranteed that he would get to make any movie he wanted to in the future. MacFarlane is most known for creating and providing many of the voices for the cartoon shows such as 'Family Guy', 'The Cleveland Show', and 'American Dad'. All of which are family oriented shows. But with 'Ted', he took it a couple of steps further and made a solid 'R' rated movie with tons of laughs and a decent story.Well, if you thought 'Ted' was raunchy, then you better hold onto your cowboy hats, because 'A Million Ways To Die In The West' makes 'Ted' look like a Disney film, when you compare just how vulgar it is. I'm sure a lot of people will want to compare this to 'Blazing Saddles', as both films take place in the Wild West and are silly comedies. But I suggest you leave 'Blazing Saddles' at the door, because you really can't compare the two. 'Blazing Saddles' knows exactly what type of movie it is from the start and never tries to deviate from that. But with 'A Million Ways To Die In The West', MacFarlane almost loses his way in what kind of movie it actually wants to be, rather it be a straight western, a silly comedy, a musical, or a drama.In it's two hour runtime, you'll no doubt laugh your ass off throughout at some of the jokes, but you might not find yourself connecting with any of the characters like you did with 'Ted'. This is basically MacFarlane's opus to the wild west and has spared no expense in showing off the real beautiful locations in the middle of the desert where he built a town from the ground up and had tons of helicopter shots showcasing the amazing landscapes of rural New Mexico. The film focuses on Albert (MacFarlane) who seems to be way ahead of his time and not meant to live in the late 1800s. He runs his parents sheep farm fairly badly, and has a fear of just about everything. His one thing that keeps him from waking up every morning and making the gross wild west worth living in is his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried), who would rather be treated to riches than have a decent guy. Louise leaves Albert for Foy (Neil Partrick Harris), who owns a mustache growing and grooming business, and Harris just kills this role perfectly. Is there anything N.P.H. can't do?Albert's best friend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi), a friendly and decent man and his girlfriend Ruth (Sarah Silverman), a prostitute who will do any sexual act with anyone, but wants to save herself for marriage to Edward calm Albert down in the local saloon where Albert goes on a ten minute hilarious rant on why the Wild West is so dangerous, hence the title of the film. Meanwhile, the most dangerous man in the southwest named Clinch (Liam Neeson), has his posse of thugs robbing and killing their way to steal gold and money. Clinch's wife Anna (Charlize Theron) does not want any part of this life and seems more like a prisoner more than Clinch's wife. After Clinch murders an old man for gold, he tells his wife to head down to the nearest town while he and his posse lie low and look for more scores.This is where Albert meets and Anna, and the two fall in love with each other, which Albert does not know of Anna's current situation. From here the film plays out more like a romantic comedy with some silly humor thrown in for good measure with a glorious song and dance number about mustaches, physical comedy in the vein of Looney Toons, and some sexual situations that could make any veteran porn star blush. But with all of these genres mixed in the span of a couple of hours, it seems that MacFarlane wanted to add every thing into one melting pot and not focus on the story as much as set up to punchline. But after saying that, 'A Million Ways To Die In The West' is quite funny, and has some jokes that garner a belly laugh throughout.Since MacFarlane has been in the TV business for more than twenty years, as he's written, created, produced, directed, and provided his voice for numerous projects, it was only a matter of time before he cast himself in a live action movie as the main star. While I think MacFarlane is one of the finest voice actors around, he still needs a little work with his acting chops, and the movie could have benefited from not having him as the lead role, but rather another Hollywood A-Lister.There just isn't much there besides his good delivery on jokes. But everyone else in the film seems to have a great time with their roles and are tons of fun to watch. Two of the best aspects of the film are its epic score by Joel McNeely, which excites you from the get-go. It brings back memories of the old fun western films of adventure and romance. It is one of my favorite music scores in a long time. The other aspect is its cameos. There are tons of them and you will applaud at each single one. 'A Million Ways To Die In The West' is largely funny, but lacks the character development and connectivity that was available in MacFarlane's previous effort.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

101,jdkraus,Seth in the West,5,1 June 2014,"Okay. I'll be honest. I love Seth MacFarlane. Yes, his humor can be crude, vulgar, and even flat out disgusting but it also can be intelligent, witty, and thought out satire. He is a bit of an acquired taste so for those who have not seen ""Ted"" or have not watched ""Family Guy,"" people may find his jokes unfunny and perhaps repulsive. Going into the theater to see ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" I anticipated both the shock and ludicrous style of comedy that Seth throws into the viewers' faces. I snickered. I chuckled. I laughed. But I did not erupt into a belly-full of laughter nor could I find myself lost and immersed in an absurdity of outrageous comedy. This was certainly an ambitious project for Seth, especially with the fact that he starred (in person) in his own movie. Yet, he collided into two huge cataclysms of disaster.First is the story. The idea is simple. A cowardly farmer (MacFarlane) lives in an age that he does belong. He sees things for what they are and questions the frontier lifestyle—how so easy it is to die from the diseases, gun battles, Indians, food, and bodily functions like flatulence. Like with many westerns, he becomes an unlikely hero as he befriends a female gunslinger (Charlize Theron) who helps him win back his girl (Amanda Seyfield) from a snobby mustache man (Neil Patrick Harris). He is supported by his two friends—a prostitute (Sara Silverman) and her soon- to-be, Christian-abiding husband (Giovanni Ribisi). The villain is no other than the fastest gun in the West (Liam Neeson). This sounds just like any other western concept, bordering on being a big cliché. That is not a problem for a comedy. What is though, is the fact that Seth MacFarlane focuses on trying to tell a story with engaging characters when it is unnecessary. Frankly, with this kind of movie, the audience wants to see crazy comedy, not a good story. This leads to the other matter—lack of humor. Seth is notorious for tossing in a gag anywhere he can. This thought-process is so apparent that there are short moments of great humor and then long moments of absolutely nothing worthwhile to watch. This plagued the movie so much that I could hear only silence for over half of the film. This is pretty bad for a movie that is supposed to poke fun of the west. In short, it became dull and daunting. I really want to enjoy this movie. It is too long and it falls short. ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is not terrible either. Adding up all the funny bits, minus from what the previews gave away, the fun is only a half hour at most. There was a lot potential for this movie—particularly with good roles by such a great cast. Every moment with Sarah Silverman and Giovanni Ribisi is pure gold. Even they cannot save the film.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

105,MrDHWong,I liked it more than Ted,7,28 May 2016,"A Million Ways To Die In The West is a Western-Comedy film by Family Guy/Ted creator Seth MacFarlane. I found it pretty funny and I liked it more than Ted, although the humour is a bit different this time around.The film is set in the American old west in 1882, and focuses around a cowardly sheep farmer named Albert (Seth MacFarlane), who gets dumped by his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) when he wimps out on a duel. Afterwards, he meets a woman named Anna (Charlize Theron) who helps him regain his courage and confidence in himself. Albert later discovers that Anna is the wife of Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson), an infamous, murderous outlaw who is not too happy about his wife hanging around other men.The humour is very typical of Seth MacFarlane. It's crude, witty, fast-paced and often quite clever. If you're not a fan of his work (i.e. Family Guy, American Dad or Ted) then you probably won't care for this film. However, I found his character Albert was quite likable and not really as in-your-face as I thought he'd be. Liam Neeson is also at his most bad-ass as the villain. I also really liked the cinematography used on the Western-style establishing shots and horse chase scenes.I rate it 7/10",A Million Ways to Die in the West
106,cinematic_aficionado,Fun but over the top on few occasions,6,3 June 2014,"Making a western that is also comedy cannot be a straightforward task. Seth Macfarlane opted for a crass satire of that whole era and everything about it.A local farmer who comes across as a total loser, is forced to man-up by circumstances he could not possibly fathom. Few surprises were in store for him along the way and a journey of self discovery is probably not what he had in mind.On the whole, this is a mixed bag of experiences. There is a side to it which is absolutely hilarious; great satire and wit about this very backward time and place which was rather refreshing to see. The downside is that at times this was overdone and the language was a bit over the top on occasions.To make the most out of it, one simply must accept it for what it is and enjoy themselves.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
107,DareDevilKid,MacFarlane's Back with Another Side-Splitting Romp,8,9 September 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 stars""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is Seth MacFarlane's follow-up to Ted, and once again as always he's a one-man band – co-producing, co-writing, directing, and this time he even takes on the added responsibility of acting in his own script, that to as the lead performer. MacFarlane plays Albert, a meek and unhappy sheep farmer in the frontier of America in 1882. He's just been ditched by girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) and he's way too aware of the dangers the wild west holds. Rattlesnakes, outlaws, diseases, epidemics, lack of proper medical aid you name it. When Anna (Charlize Theron) arrives in town to await for her gunslinger husband Clinch (Liam Neeson), she decides to train him up for the showdown he's meant to be having with Louise's new boyfriend, the mustachioed Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). From there on the story unravels predictably yet pleasantly, and at a decent pace. There's also a refreshingly hilarious side plot involving Albert's best friend, the virginal Edward (Giovanni Ribisi), whose girlfriend Ruth (Sarah Silverman) – one of the town's whores – refuses to sleep with him until they're married and also because they're Christian.The script while uneven, is no doubt uproariously funny; helped in great part due to MacFarlane's simple but effective directorial skills. The screenplay mostly serves as fodder for one comic gag after another, but they are neatly crafted together too form a lucid, coherent, and enjoyable film. There are plenty of fart and genitalia jokes – some admittedly too gross – but MacFarlane smartly weaves them into the narrative so that they aren't felt contrived or forced. Besides these familiar elements from MacFarlane's repertoire, there are also plenty of sublime moments that elevate this deliberately silly comedy, meant for those who enjoy silly, playful banter without being smug about it. Special mention needs to be given to Joel McNeely's retro background score and Michael Barrett's cinematography. Their work lends the whole package an aura of genre authenticity.Both Theron and Neeson bring weight to their roles, and although no- one is given much to do apart from MacFarlane, they run brilliantly with what they've got. Neeson plays the quintessential evil bad-ass with aplomb and charisma, while Theron brings an effervescent comic charm to her character and strikes a surprising screen chemistry with MacFarlane, which comes greatly in use whenever our Director stumbles in his other job in front of the camera. As far as his acting credentials are concerned, the jury is still out on MacFarlane's on-camera future as a lead, for nothing about his individual performance screams out as anything more than functional. He's outclassed in the company of seasoned talents such as Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson, but this also speaks volumes of his growing dexterity as a Director, for in the larger scheme of things, Theron and Neeson outshining him in majority of their scenes together actually works in an odd way for his character and also for the script. Whether it was a conscious effort or unwitting outcome will never be known, but for now let's assume that MacFarlane the Director was aware of his limits and deliberately executed the narrative in this fashion. Sadly, he also comes up short in scenes with supporting cast members such as Amanda Seyfried, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, and Neil Patrick Harris – all deliver inspired work and contribute towards elevating the laugh quotient of the film – and this does take away a bit from the final outcome of this otherwise outrageously funny and unabashedly irreverent laugh riot.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
108,TheSquiss,One way to die of boredom in my seat.,2,12 August 2014,"The trailer for A Million Ways to Die in the West looked fun. Good cast, black comedy, and a team with a track record.I did smile once. I checked my watch and it came on 33 minutes with the start of the bar fight. Up until then I'd stifled groans and sighs of exasperation at horribly obvious and clumsily set up lines like, ""Dude, you really shouldn't drink & horse."" Ho hum.A Million Ways to Die in the West sets out to be a clever parody of the perils of the Wild West but winds up a painfully obvious, drawn out, 21st century looser flick with sledgehammer dialogue and fancy dress.Alas, it isn't very clever and wasn't at all funny for a full hour. Beyond that I have no idea and little interest as the boredom threatened to rot my brain and I departed before grey matter leaked out of my ears.I'm sure there's a joke somewhere in A Million Ways to Die in the West but it's difficult to hear it amongst all the dull thudding.It warrants two stars purely for the presence of Charlize Theron. She may make poor choices occasionally, but she remains a fine actress and the cause of more than a few heart flutters.It wasn't an entirely wasted evening; I made it home in time to watch a couple of episodes of The Inbetweeners.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
109,RevRonster,Sometimes funny...sometimes far less so.,6,10 November 2014,"Seth MacFarlane approaches his Old West comedy like a machine gun. He rapidly fires a lot of jokes at the audience and has little regard for whether or not they are of any quality. Granted, he takes this approach with everything he writes and, sometimes, it works out very well—like ""Ted""—but, in this case, it worked out in only making an average comedy that is funny at times and pretty bad at others.First off, even though Seth MacFarlane isn't a very good actor (voice acting is his real strong suit, in my opinion), the rest of the cast is made up of very talented people who found the right balance of being serious and funny at the same time. Without a doubt, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, and Neil Patrick Harris were my favorite actors in the film and were able to make their characters very entertaining. Liam Neeson was also very good as the antagonist and straight man to MacFarlane's more goofy character. Finally, one of my favorite things about the film was the celebrities who showed up to play small cameos and bit parts. That part really made the film fun.As for the story, it works to an extent but due to the fact that Liam Neeson's character (Clinch) spends a lot of time missing from the plot it makes the overall film feel like it was mashing together two separate scripts. While the two stories work—one where Albert is trying to win his ex back and the other being getting the murder eye from Clinch—and they could have blended very well together but the final results feel jarring due to Clinch missing for a majority of the movie.Finally, the comedy is all over the place. Some moments I laughed like crazy but these moments weren't very frequent. Other times I found myself chuckling slightly or, at the worst, was shaking my head at disgust at the repetitive or predictable nature of the gags. Additionally, MacFarlane relies way too heavily on swears to try and create punchlines and all it did was make the film look lazy and weak—like if he couldn't come up with something funny, just saying a swear would somehow disguise that fact. Swears don't bother me but using them for cheap punchlines do.""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" may not be a perfect or uproariously hilarious comedy but it has its moments that make it worth watching.Howdy, folks (Yes, I went for the stereotypical western greeting)!

Although, he tries his very best for the latter, rambling on and on about everything that bugs the living hell out of him...Meanwhile the side-characters, including Anna, played by Charlize Theron, and Liam Neeson's dastardly outlaw Clinch, don't seem convinced they're in a comedy Which isn't so bad since the performances in A MILLION WAYS TO DIE are laidback and natural, and Albert's plight is involving: When his girlfriend dumps him for another guy, he prepares for a showdown but finds himself pitted against a much more lethal adversary, that being Liam Neeson, the husband of his budding new love interest, Theron.While the title supports all the action-driven gags in the first half, mostly seen in the trailers... including a guy getting his head crushed by a block of ice... the funniest (and/or cleverest) lines are observations about the 1800's: like how no one smiles in photographs and examples of old school racism. These probably won't evoke belly laughter like the sporadic bouts of ""toilet humor"" attempt to do, but each subtle quip provides McFarland a chance to philosophize in his own bold fashion, not letting any minority group or religious sect off the hook.With gorgeous exterior shots, an intentionally melodramatic soundtrack and a bevy of expository montage sequences, the movie plays out like a bonafide Cowboy picture with jokes on the side...

111,bbickley13-921-58664,A Million ways to have Fun!!,7,29 May 2014,"From the man who brought us Ted, one of the best films of 2012.Seth plays a man who lives in the old Wild West, tackling the new frontier as a sheep herder. While the movie is shoot in a style that glamorizes the terrain of Arizona in 1882, Seth as Albert makes observations about how not so great the west actually was, using his typical sight gangs to show you the worse of the worse.Seth is really good at this no matter if it's animated or live action. All the gags pointing out how people are casually killed in the west, from the various illnesses to the lack of medical advancements, to the outlaws, is nothing but hilarious.I always felt one of the downfalls of Family Guy is that the show's gags can be hit or miss depending on one's knowledge of the constant pop culture references, if you did not grow up in the 80's, you might not get half of it, but the western theme made the references more universal. From gags about the value of a dollar, to how life spans were much shorter than they are now.And of course what is a Seth MacFarlane movie without a few racial jokes, but don't worry, everyone was fair game from Blacks to Asians to Indians and even a few other races most would not associate with the Wild West.McFarlane and Charlize Theron make a great on screen duo. I don't think I've ever seen her do comedy, except for hosting Saturday night live, which she was funny in as well. Speaking of being sexy and funny, Sarah Silverman was outrageous as a western whore whose religious beliefs allow her to have sex with everyman for money but not with her own boyfriend, played by Giovanni Ribisi, who is saving it for marriage. It should go without saying that the great Liam Neeson plays a bad ass bad guy in the flick.This movie was funny and entertaining like a western should be.

My wife and son seemed to enjoy the movie, but I laughed more at my wife laughing than at the movie itself. First, pretty much all of the supposedly-funny scenes were shown in the previews. Second, use of the f-word in itself is not funny unless it's used by someone totally out of character, like grandma or a nun. Simply throwing it randomly in every so often is not comedy. ""Let's get effed up,"" Seth utters in one 'hilarious' scene. Ha, ha, ha. Hadn't realized I'd walked into a spring-break movie aimed at teens.Basically, the dialog is not very funny, and the physical comedy mostly relies on grossing you out.I enjoyed 'Ted,' but will not likely rush out to see Seth's next offering after this nonsense.

I just watched this off HBO GO over the weekend, and was expecting to laugh as hard as I did at Seth MacFarlane's other works including ""Family Guy"", ""The Cleveland Show"" and his big-screen directorial debut, ""Ted"". But with ""A Million Ways to Die in the West""- I thought it was pretty funny/good, don't get me wrong; I just didn't laugh as much as I thought I would.MacFarlane stars as a sheep farmer in the old West who is a bit of a downer- constantly focuses on how many ways to die there are (hence, the name of the movie). After being dumped by his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried), he starts a thing with a mysterious newcomer (Charlize Theron), whose hubbie (Liam Neeson) is a murderous bandit on the rampage. Wow- what a cast- besides the above-mentioned, Sarah Silverman, Giovanni Ribisi, Neil Patrick Harris, etc... I like MacFarlane, but am just amazed every time I see him of his resemblance to Christopher Knight (AKA Peter Brady). He is an okay leading man in a ""Blazing Saddles""- style movie like this, but wonder if he should've gone with someone else to star in his own movie-??? I mean he's great with doing the voices (like in ""Ted""), but not sure he is right to anchor a big movie like this, and wonder if that may have been part of the problem-?? Because Seth's relative inexperience on-screen verses the decades of experience of his surrounding cast may have thrown off the overall balance of the movie; not sure..

116,LloydBayer,1 bullet 2 genres.,3,29 May 2014,"Over the top and under the belt, A Million Ways to Die in the West is a comedy-western, that in part, stays true to the title. While the narration is a verbose and often morbid illustration on countless ways you could get killed in the Wild West, do not overlook the possibility that you could also die in your seat for no other reason than sheer boredom.Best known for creating, scripting and voicing characters in TV's Family Guy and The Cleveland Show - animations that are both outrageous and equally hilarious – Seth McFarlane does a quadruple take in this film as writer-director-producer while also playing the lead role. Having done the same in 2012's Ted, about a not- so- cuddly yet hilariously charismatic teddy bear, McFarlane tries his hand at a western but can't seem to decide if it's a parody or homage to the western film genre. And that is the first stumbling block in a long line of stumbling blocks. With an opening credit scene overlooking the Grand Canyon, ala Sergio Leone, the setting is 1882 Arizona. McFarlane plays Albert Stark - a coward, a pessimist and a sheep farmer who can't tend to his own flock. After chickening out of a gun fight, Albert loses his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) to the mustachioed Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), the wealthy owner of you guessed it, a mustachery. Drowning his sorrows in a bar one night, Albert describes to his only friend Edward, how the West is exactly as described by the film's title. Sure enough, a bar fight ensues and more people die. This is also when Albert saves the life of Anna (Charlize Theron) a beautiful loner with a mysterious past. In turn, Anna teaches Albert a thing or two about marksmanship, and a whole lot on how to be a man. But just as they fall for each other, Anna's badass husband and bandit Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) rides into town, resulting in another high-noon shoot out. Can Albert chicken his way out of this one?With hundreds of crude and often rude gags, A million Ways to Die in the West kills itself in the first half hour with at least three flatulence jokes that goes flat even before it rips; All before one character shows you how to go to the toilet (twice) when there's no toilet around. In putting the 'R' in outrageous, it's OK to be perverted if the result is overpowering hilarity. We've seen this before in Ted, but how do you explain going from whimsical wit to cringe-worthy toilet humor? Some would call it dumb or even juvenile but I have to say that McFarlane has dented his pedigree as the highest paid TV writer with shoddy and quite frankly, lazy writing. In addition to several racial, sexist and pop-culture gags that may or may not hit the funny bone, McFarlane's script suffers from various plot points that are left abandoned. Maybe I didn't get it the first time but one unexplained joke has Ribisi's Edward say that he is a virgin but engaged to the town prostitute (Sarah Silverman as Ruth) who beds up to ten men on a slow day. Ruth retorts to saving sex for marriage because she is Christian. This and many more subplots appear to have no relevance if not just for bloating the run time.All said and done, if ever there is a highlight in the film, it would have to be the countless cameos throughout. Remember, McFarlane plays a coward who gets called ""Yellow"" all the time, so expect more than one reference to Marty McFly (Michael J. fox) in Back to the Future III. Other cameos are mere split second appearances but if you blink you miss them. Whether a parody or homage, A Million Ways to Die in the West is a low blow for comedy with laughs inversely proportionate to the title. And if this is an attempt at reviving the western genre, I seriously doubt it has an ounce of inspiration for other film makers. That stagecoach rode into the sunset a long time ago!",A Million Ways to Die in the West
117,diac228,"Wasted talent, wasted potential, ultimately a waste of time",4,30 May 2014,"Seth MacFarlane is the equivalent of the college student that has all the potential of breezing through his years with straight As and honors in everything imaginable----but settles for the easier, calmer Bs and Cs. The man is notoriously smart, notoriously gifted, and it makes all the more frustrating when Family Guy dips itself to crass and gross-out humor when we know that MacFarlane has the ability to make a show to the creative geeky levels of a Community or a 30 Rock.A Million Ways to Die in the West falls straight into the woulda, coulda, shoulda category.This comedic western (extremely rare genre with very few success stories) is a jumbled mess that unveils the wasted talent (Neil Patrick Harris and Sarah Silverman being the best examples) and the infinite level of potential. The plot was forgettable, the jokes and one-liners are all throwaways, and there was nothing really outstanding about the production aside from the cinematography. It was even lacking the classic Western tension that makes the genre stand out on its own.MacFarlane tried to throw everything at the movie, from shifts in tone to the shifts in humor. And you thought Lone Ranger had a clunky tone, wait until you get a kick out of this one. There's a clever monologue about how bad life really was in the West, but then we get tons of toilet humor mixed in. Adding to the mayhem is a sentimental story, random violent sequences, even more random musical sequences, and unexpected but unnecessary cameos. It all felt very random and although it may work in a short film format (Robot Chicken), this style flounders severely if it becomes a two-hour affair.There will be laughs; there will be some jokes that hit. But similar to the latter seasons of Family Guy, the amount of missed jokes subtracts from the overall enjoyment. And it hits the gut harder since this is a very smart, sophisticated, and well-rounded individual with tons of writing and singing experience behind the wheel. This is Seth MacFarlane we are talking about, not Adam Sandler. And the cast is full of Oscar and Emmy talent, not a bunch of duds (Like most of Adam Sandler's friends).Seth, I know you are capable of much better. Step up to the plate and actually deliver it.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
118,buckikris,"Some Funny Moments, But This One Will Go Straight To Rexbox",7,1 June 2014,"I went to see this movie primarily because Liam Neeson was in it. I felt he and Charlize Theron were mainly the lifesavers of this movie. I have never seen a Seth MacFarlane movie before. This movie is no Blazing Saddles. I think what hurt it was some of the toilet humor, acting, and the offensive remark about the runaway slave shooting game, remarks toward Asians, and some sexual references that were unnecessary. I am not a prude but I feel this movie could have been done better if MacFarlane would have taken some pointers from the very funny Blazing Saddles. I am a huge Liam Neeson fan and his character surprised me I didn't think he would end up being such a D**K. I don't think I have ever seen him play that kind of role before. I knew he would be a tough gunslinger, but I felt he was kind of out of his element. As for the rest of the movie , yes their were some funny moments, but sometimes it went a little too far with the crude humor. I guess the one reason why I gave it a 7 is because, of Neeson, Theron, and the Cameos. This is not a movie to take your child to see, or anyone under 17 for that matter. So as for Western comedies Blazing Saddles will still be one of the best in my books.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",A Million Ways to Die in the West
119,Okonh0wp,Really great film,10,9 October 2015,"Although it's definitely more of a popcorn film more than an ambitious comedy, there's something to be said for a comedy that can deliver such a strong rhythm of laugh-inducing moments and for me ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" was one of those films. Seth MacFarlane's work is great when you first discover it but the scatological randomness and the hit-or-miss ratio starts to get to you after a while. While a lot of moviegoers preferred ""Ted,"" I think it suffered from just being crass and having a protagonist who wasn't really rootable. By casting himself as an underdog in comparison to the manly men who settled the frontier, Seth MacFarlane creates a more likable protagonist here. With the exception of one scene (Neil Patrick Harris's shoot-off), he also manages to stay clear of overly crass and low ball humor and makes great use of his hyper- familiarity with pop culture to create something I found more memorable than ""Ted."" Another meta-joke is that MacFarlane is obviously an anachronism: He doesn't fit into the Wild West because he's obviously not taking the time and energy to be a true period actor. Your mileage may vary but I prefer this film when it comes to MacFarlane's best works.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
120,jayjaycee,"The childish, the idiotic and the vulgar",5,15 January 2020,"""A Million Ways To Die In The West"" is a 2014 western comedy directed by Seth MacFarlane starring him and Charlize Theron. As you may know, I'm a huge fan of Western, one of the oldest and most beloved genres of Hollywood, mostly influenced by the ""Red Dead Redemption"" video games I spent dozens of hours on. I can't even name all the titles I already gave a watch, but sure it was always a massive pleasure. The most fascinating thing about this sub-genre is simply the fact that it takes place in a world with established rules, but still has endless possibilities to create something never seen before - no films is like the other. Now, several years after my fourteen year old me surreptitiously clicked on the trailer and laughed at the ice block scene, I finally got to watch it for the first time. Expectedly, it's nothing but disappointingly cheap fun. For a film that was made by the creator of ""Ted"" I had mixed feelings about what to expect. It could have been either great comedy or unfunny and childish trash. Latter was the case. First of all, the film appears to be a western with comedy elements and not a comedy with western elements. It could not really decide on what it wanted to be and hence the tone shifted from serious to playful faster than Billy the Kid was able to shoot. It was literally in between the two extremes and that's why most of the jokes or dramatic scenes never really worked out properly. The cast therefore consists of versatile actors I wonder what SMF has done to get them in this obviously terrible film. I mean, Liam Neeson was great as usual (can I consider it a life goal I got to see his bottom?), Theron was loveable and even SMF himself delivered mediocre for his standards. The thing is, most of the screenplay was just not hilarious and felt more like a terrible episode of ""Family Guy"" that the producers declined to broadcast. Also, I could not quite take NPH that serious (he just played a costumed version of Barney Stinson) and when I actually laughed it was to the sheer stupidity of it. If there's anything memorable about it, it's the cameos, most memorable the ones of Dr. Emmet Brown and Django and I scream of cheer at how it confirmed that these titles take place in the same universe. But next to this, that film is only mildly entertaining and had a few chuckles. I'd consider it as mediocre fun if it wasn't for the vulgarity and lavatorial humour (why did I have to clearly see the scrotum of a sheep?) that was absolutely embarrassing to the story. In most cases it destroyed the pointe of what could have been a great skit. Oh, and don't get me started about that moustache song. And the hash cookie. Or the Indian drug. Also, why did it have to include an unnecessary and absolutely predictable romance of a subplot between Anna and Albert? Oh, I forgot: To make the movie that already suffers from the lack of originality and interesting plot decisions even longer and painfully stretched to two and a half hours of run time. All in all, I'm honestly saddened to admit that I'm extremely disappointed with the outcome of what easily could have been a classic comedy gem. It had potential, mostly the right actors and what SMF created is just not what I can laugh about. Of course it's naughty, but in an extremely cringe way and way too much of it feels like the film of a twelve year old who tried to mock his favourite western films and took it way too far. It could have been great, but it's just like the relationship between Albert and the bottles: It's a miss.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
121,gavinp9,"A decent, if scattershot, comedy",6,2 January 2018,"'A Million Ways to Die in the West' certainly delivers on what the title promises! For a comedy, there's a lot of death - so much so that it's basically smashing the point over our heads. Set in 1882 Arizona, it's a story about Albert (MacFarlane), wallowing in his sheep farming life on the ""frontier"". It gets better when Anna (Theron) comes along, but there are complications when Clinch (Neeson) arrives. Basically, there's a few Western elements - plenty of shorts of New Mexico/Utah filling in for old Arizona, some tumbleweed and gun duels - but the way MacFarlane talks and acts makes it feel modern (and sometimes as if you're watching 'Family Guy').There are some pretty funny/oddly short cameos - Christopher Lloyd, Ewan McGregor, Ryan Reynolds & Jamie Foxx - whether they add to the humour or detract is up for debate. There's really not much to the story, and it's pretty predictable, so it's surprising that it goes for almost two hours. Plenty of toilet humour, which can be a good thing in small does, but probably goes a little overboard. The main problem is that while there's plenty of good jokes, they're too much like a sitcom and are unable to sustain the plot and sometimes fall flat.'A Million Ways to Die in the West' is not a bad follow-up to 'Ted', but you can't help but feel that MacFarlane bit off more than he could chew here, being star, writer, director and producer.

122,TheMarwood,A million jokes die in this movie,3,3 September 2014,"Within the first 10 minutes of this western sitcom, MacFarlane goes on about all the horrible ways to die and how miserable life in the west is and if he only filmed all the silliness he rambles on about instead of poorly delivering dialogue, maybe this would have some life. MacFarlane doesn't really give a performance, as he's more a joke machine that doesn't shut up and he's the obstacle in every scene the film can't hurtle. As a director he spoon feeds the comedy to us, forcing this strained premise that might work in more capable hands, but in his it feels like a stand up comedian bombing on stage drowning in flop sweat. For a film that tries its hardest to be offensive, it's structured in the laziest, most generic outline of a narrative - MacFarlane gets dumped by his girl and he wants to win back her heart and a contrived series of events leads him to a woman who will help him, but they are really the ones for each other. Every character is defined by one attribute and calling them one dimensional is even pushing it - there's a wimp, a whore, a nice church going guy, the villain's wife who really has a nice heart and putting these lame archetypes in a 30 minute TV sitcom would be pushing tedium. When a Back to the Future 3 gag is the most inspired bit, you know you're running on fumes. A last act hallucination sequence injects some much needed life into this, but it's too little too late.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

124,monstermayhem32,A interesting western spoof,7,1 June 2014,"I think what made the film rather interesting was how the film was like a spoof of western films and had many great laughs. The film had cameo appearances by Christopher Lloyd reprising his doc brown character from back to the future films and Jamie Foxx returning as django. Seth mcfaralane plays the title role of Albert who gets dumped by his girlfriend Louise played by Amanda after getting fed up of his cowardly antics and pursues another man for played by Neil Patrick Harris who looks rather hilarious with a mustache, Albert ends up falling with a gunslinger named Anna played by Charlize Theron who teaches Albert how to shoot a gun and the two of them develop an attraction between each other while trying to to evade her husband clinch played by Liam neeson who is rather funny her, other great performances including Giovanni ribsi as Alberts friend Edward and Sarah Silverman as e hooker Ruth that Edward likes. Overall I would say it is so great way of getting some laughs.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
125,CountJonnie,"Started funny, and than it went down the drain",5,1 September 2014,"Seth McFarlane is a funny guy, which he proves with Family Guy and Ted. People love Seth's rude, fast and confronting humor, and they should. It works especially with animation and decent / o.k. acting.But in this movie, Seth didn't deliver. After a few jokes and some laughs, the jokes got old very, very fast. They've all been done before. Combine that with Seth being a horrible actor. Even the other actors didn't save this picture, 'cause they all looked as if they wanted to be somewhere else.Acting doesn't Always need to be perfect. Heck, people love Commando, Expendables part 1, Naked Gun etc. for a reason. But as an actor, at least make it look as if you're trying. So the advice to Seth is to keep writing, keep directing, but stay BEHIND the camera.5 out of 10: 3 for the movie and 2 for the cameo's.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

127,martinrobertson300482,Constant gags,7,2 June 2014,"I've always been unsure about whether Seth MacFarlanes actually some sort of comedy genius, or whether he just got lucky with a one hit wonder - ""Family Guy."" Now, when ""Family guy"" first started, i've got to admit, I hated it. I saw it as little more than a ""Simpson's"" rip-off. But over the years it's grown on me. As it really is just all about the jokes. If you forget that there's never much of a storyline, and that its actually like more of a sketch show. Then ye, it is very funny at times. But when it comes to movies, is this same style still going to work? Well, he managed to make a hilarious movie with ""Ted,"" and he's also kind off managed it again with ""A Million ways to die in the West."" MacFarlane manages to make another funny movie here without having to relay to much on the constant movie references, and crude humour he's renowned for. Although sometimes these kind off jokes still work their way in. A Good 20 minutes into the movie, I really did think it was going to seriously suck. But once it gets a lot of its terrible ""poop"" gags out of the way early. The rest is a laugh riot.There are constant gags throughout ""A Million ways to die in the West"" so there are bound to be some stinkers amongst all of the great old west spoofs, dumb awkward jokes, and hilarious scenes of Neil Patrick Harris as a ""moustached"" villain that there are squeezed in here. Plus, the flick even has a bit of a surprising sweet side to help balance out the rude stuff.Not to mention that it stars 2 of the biggest stunners in Hollywood. Charlize Theron and Amanda Seyfried (Who gets to poke fun at herself a lot in the movie) in the same film? Awesome. And MacFarlane gets to kiss both of them? Lucky him!",A Million Ways to Die in the West
128,bazmitch23,"Much like Albert's shooting, this movie misses it's target",1,15 March 2015,"Ted was a film that you could watch over and over again. This film doesn't.The story and characters aren't that interesting. The only character that I found interesting was Foy (NPH has a fun time playing this tosser who is in love with himself. I don't know why, but I like characters who are deeply in love with themselves). But the other characters; Albert is just Brian Griffen as a cowboy, Anna is a bland badass, Clinch Leatherwood (sigh, I know) is just a forgettable villain, no big deal and Louise doesn't do anything memorable. She's meant to be a nasty person, but she's not unlikeable enough. If they made the character a real bitch, it could've worked. Edward was okay, though.Some gags kind of work and other gags really heavily on potty humour. ""Oh ha, ha..... he farted!""Oh look, Wes Studi is a Native American........ AGAIN! Poor bastard.Many people criticized Seth MacFarlene's acting and I have to agree. He's a very good voice actor, but not good live action one. He has no facial expression. If someone else was cast as Albert, it might've worked. The Doc Brown cameo was pointless. He is never mentioned again. Poor Chris Lloyd will never live it down as Doc Brown, ever.However, Ewan McGregor tricked me. I couldn't recognize him when I first saw the film.And I thought that Django cameo was amusing. The finale wasn't all that exciting. It's just another boring dual. That was it. On a brighter note, it really does capture the western beautifully. Arizona looks amazing and the score works. Stump looks cool. NPH is pretty much the only good thing in this movie, mainly due to the fact that he plays the only interesting character.Sorry, Seth. But maybe you'll win us back with Ted 2.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
129,ghost_dog86,"Slightly funnier than ""Ted""; just not funny enough.",6,31 May 2014,"After being recently dumped by a woman named Louise (Amanda Seyfried) for the owner of a moustachery (Neil Patrick Harris) a sheepish sheep farmer named Albert (Seth MacFarlane) who has a little Don Knotts ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"" in him (just way more vulgar) finds himself falling for a mysterious, gunslingin' woman named Anna (Charlize Theron). The thing is, Anna is married to Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) the prototypical rough and tumble, no nonsense, most intimidating bad guy in the West.Though ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" has all the makings of a hilarious Comedy-Western; with a running time about thirty minutes too long (a la ""Django Unchained"") this satirical comedy is funny, yet sadly forgettable.Being that this is a raunchy comedy set in the wild west, it is impossible not to compare it to the likes of ""Blazing Saddles"", which is a death sentence in and of itself. And it doesn't help that it has been wildly apparent for years how Seth Macfarlane desperately wishes to be proclaimed as this era's Mel Brooks (which he is not). That said, I'm not saying that ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" isn't funny. Quite the contrary; it's slightly funnier than ""Ted"" (MacFarlane's last directorial attempt). Here's the problem: With ""Ted"" we saw stretches of laugh-out-loud bits, followed by stretches of waiting to laugh moments. In ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" there is a pretty consistent chuckle factor all the way through. The cleverness in the script's ""Family Guy"" inspired crudeness and boundary pushing subject matter is quite apparent. But therein lies the problem. Even though I found this funnier than ""Ted"", there was never that laugh-out-loud moment. And chuckle-a-minute comedies are usually not what people pay eleven dollars to see.With pacing and cinematography that would be at home in any American Western during the John Ford era and a plethora of solid ""old west"" characters, it is obvious that MacFarlane holds the Western genre in high regard. But while ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" has the look of a proficient Western, and while the comedic aspect is consistently funnier than what most critics are giving it credit for, MacFarlane has a hard time integrating these two genre's into one fully formed Comedy-Western; as throughout the film he clumsily switches back and forth between comedy and classic Western. This results in an ongoing feeling of tonal unevenness or genre wavering.While MacFarlane's direction is hit or miss, his performance does steal the show. Who knew that MacFarlane could hold his own, as the charismatic lead, against this star studded cast? Well, probably a lot of people knew that, but it did take me by surprise.Final Thought: What it all comes down to is that for a comedy to reach a certain level of entertainment value, there needs to be at least a few memorable/quotable moments within it. As I alluded to earlier, MacFarlane's sense of humor here will garner chuckles and the film itself is never really boring (as ""Ted"" was multiple times). However, there is nothing in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" that is memorable enough to quote back and forth between your friends post-viewing.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
130,ultramatt2000-1,McFarlane goes West!,10,11 July 2014,"Love ""Family Guy?"" ""American Dad?"" ""The Cleavland Show?"" How about ""Ted?"" Well if you do, have I got the movie for you. ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is like ""Family Guy"" in the West. It has all those run-of-the-mill jokes that McFarlane recycles his jokes he used in ""Family Guy."" It is hilarious, gross and there is a ton of pop-culture references. The songs in this film are funny. Albert Star, played by McFarlane, is like a human version of Brian, every time I see him talk about how terrible and stupid the Old-West is, I can imagine Brian diplomatically complaining. I was laughing in hysterics at the theater with a few other people. Some girls behind were laughing and saying shut up. Either they were shutting themselves up, shutting me up or both. This movie got a ton of flack and I know why. Because he is milking his jokes from his cartoon work. That's fine, but that doesn't stop me from liking it because he is my comic influence. I think people are jealous and want to take him down. People are like, ""Oh this guy did 'Ted' and now he is doing this one. What a load of garbage."" This movie is one of those movies that flop in the box-office but do well in the video-stores, rental and on-demand market, just like John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) or ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" (2010). Need a good laugh to exorcise the madness of life? What are you waiting for and watch this movie. If Ted is to Peter Griffin and Albert Stark is to Brian, then whatever his next movie would be is to Stewie. I bet it would be an alien. I can't wait to see ""Ted 2.""

The director of Ted and creator of family guy directs his second live action motion picture and well it's bad, but not as bad as I thought it would be, I mean from the reviews I saw I was expecting a lot worse, I guess it helps I barely remember the footage shown on TV ads or online. The film revolves around Albert Stark, who is a cowardly farmer begins to fall for the mysterious new woman in town, he must put his new-found courage to the test when her husband, a notorious gun- slinger, announces his arrival. The movie does achieve it's goal for the most part, it can be funny times. When I was laughing in this picture I tilted my head so back I thought I was going to nose bleed. Although there some jokes that just don't work and aren't that memorable. The story is not very interesting but I wasn't bored by it, so I guess that's a win for both you and the movie. I really don't understand why some don't think it's that funny but humor is subjective like everything else and sometimes depending on the situation and time I can be made to laugh really easy. The performances from Seth Macfarlane is terrible, I didn't like him or his character Albert Stark in the movie he just felt like himself in a lame cowboy costume for Halloween. Even Liam Nesson I didn't like that much and he's barely in the movie which is kind of disappointing. Neil Patrick Harris and Charlize Theron are my two favorite actors in the film. They have the funniest scenes. The direction from Seth Macfarlane this time around is just terrible, I mean Seth man how could you sell out on me like this? You gave us Ted man, that's one of the few comedies I actually love. But now you give me this hunk of garbage, WHY! I did find myself enjoying this film at times,but I don't see all the elements of a good film present in this picture, I give A million Ways to Die Int The West a two out of five.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

It gave the movie an uneven feel, but I think most fans of Seth McFarlane are used to that. Actually, it really saddens me how crude a number of the jokes/sight gags were, since there were also quite a few very clever bits.The story is pretty straight-forward, which works well for a comedy. McFarlane gets dumped, gets mopey, then the new girl comes to town, she teaches him to believe in himself, etc. Basically it's Better Off Dead set in the West.For a movie titled A Million Ways to Die in the West, there were actually relatively few deaths. Relatively being only a dozen or so, and most of the totally random ones were shown in the trailers. Instead there were a lot of bodily function jokes (including sex/prostitution jokes).But the bottom line is, if you've enjoyed other Seth McFarlane movies/TV Shows, you'll enjoy this.

135,happy_hangman,Better Heard and Not Seen,3,15 March 2015,"'A Million Ways To Die in The West' confirms something I've long believed about Seth McFarlane: he lacks the confidence on film that he manifests so obviously in animation. A versatile voice-artist with a great visual imagination in his 'Family Guy' and 'American Dad' star/show-runner roles, he struggles to transfer that invention to the big screen. 'Ted' was an extended riff on a single gag: the idea of a cute kids' toy manifesting the character of a leery, loudmouthed bloke. The joke became tired and the script over-reliant on bad language and gross-out humour – which is a great shame, as McFarlane's writing CAN be very funny and insightful. That it worked was largely because both Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis have good timing and genuine screen-presence. MacFarlane himself does not...which is the big problem with 'A Million Ways...'. He LOOKS uncomfortable, throughout. Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfreid and Liam Neeson are given very little to work with, in support; Sarah Silverman and Giovanni Ribisi fare a little better – but the talents of these fine character actors are wasted by (yet again) an over- reliance on innuendo and obscenity. There are brief flashes of brilliance – the 'Moustache Song' and a trippy dream sequence, and more of that – and of the stunning Arizona landscapes, straight out of John Ford – and this might have been worthy. If Mr McF works out he can be funny without seeking low-brow affirmation every second gag, then he might make a decent film-maker.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

139,lucasnochez,Film Review: A Million Ways To Die In The West/www.nightfilmreviews.com,1,3 June 2014,"Death is undoubtedly the strongest motif in Seth MacFarlane's newest live-action feature film A Million Ways To Die In the West. And like the motif itself, one cannot help but be bored to death with a film, that started off as an inside joke between friends (MacFarlane as well as his co- writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild), and develops into a perfectly displayed example of what happens when people who have too much money are given the freedom to make any piece of cow dung they want. If you are wondering just how and why A Million Ways was made in the first place, take this into consideration; MacFarlane's first live-action feature, a film set-around a fouled mouth, prostitute loving teddy bear, only cost the studio $50 Million dollars and sought in about $550 Million, excluding profitable marketing and merchandising. A Million Ways has a production budget of about $40 Million, and will surely either recoup its budget completely, or draw in massive crowds for a pleasing profit. Seems like the wild west isn't the only west with some issues. Western society is getting more and more involved with money making ideas than with any artistic ideas of merit at all, and because of that, our canon of comedy is suffering greatly for it. I can only imagine what our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will say when they see mere minutes of this and compare it to the classic masterful parodies before this like Blazing Saddles. To say that MacFarlane's A Million Ways is bad is giving it a compliment. Watching A Million Ways only once and being able to it endure it for the one time, is like watching the dumbest person you can image hitting a loved one unnecessarily for an extended period of time, and calling it comedy. Mixing in messy slapstick, vulgarity, violence, gore, animation and unrefined sexuality and sexually innuendoed jokes, MacFarlane better snuggle up and be comfortable beside his teddy bear for the sequel of his surprise summer hit Ted, cause A Millions Ways is worse than having monsters coming out from under your bed.Like any good parody, the story begins similar to any other clichéd generic story of a specific genre, in this instance, a Western centred around a poor sheep farmer Albert Stark (MacFarlane) and his inability to assimilate himself into the life of the frontier. Unable to grasp his hand or head around guns or gunfighting, MacFarlane writes himself as the lead protagonist with much knowledge and immense wit of today's society, comparing it to the ridiculousness of the wild west. Albert, who avoids confrontation at all costs, backs-out from duels forcing his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) to leave him for a wealthier and more macho man in town, Foy (ironically, Neil Patrick Harris). Depressed, lonely and unable to shake the feelings he has with his ex-girlfriend, Albert tries to find sanity and logic from his best friends and couple, devoted Christian Edward (Giovani Ribisi) and his prostituting girlfriend Ruth (the always hysterical Sarah Silverman). Albert, ready to give up, stumbles into the saloon one night and fatefully helps a beautiful Anna (Charlize Theron) escape a dangerous situation. As the two begin to bond over gun totting and a mutual hate of the wild west, Albert's world is about to get shattered as his newest relationship finds him at the open end of Anna's husband's gun, a gun belonging to the notorious and deadly Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson).Just a few days ago, I mistakenly found myself watching a video online on the lost art of visual comedy. The video, which highlights the steps and excellent examples of visual comedy using the very small yet extremely talented filmography of Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shuan of the Dead), reminded me how little visual comedy actually occurs in mega blockbuster comedies today. Jokes, actors, dialogue and sometimes stories are hardly the problem. Usually, the problem with so many of these polished and generic comedies is their dependence on the script and the focus of whats said and not what is happening. We are slowly approaching a point in our comedic pallet where the use of sound and picture is just a forum for actors to deliver jokes; think scenic stand up with props. A Million Ways may easily falls under this category (with the exception of a dangling sheep, or the drinking and riding scenes, which may very well be my favourite parts of the film). Staging is forgotten and thrown out the window (as are countless characters in the film) and what remains is a present mentality and hopeful comedic look at the outrageousness of the wild west. But, like any previous civilizations, there's always bound to be unexplained and comedic understandings as to why people did what they did then. MacFarlane's attempt to understand the wild west and make it a gross out, rude, crude and obscene comedy, just might inspire someone one day to make a comedy of people today, and their obsession with their phones and technology. Oh that's right, they already did, its called her, too bad MacFarlane didn't take any notes.A Million Ways can best be described as lightly edited improvisation gone wrong.It baffles me how and why MacFarlane is able to round out a cast as talented and versatile as he does. Sadly, so much of the industry is devoted and based on favours. So when a predominant A-Lister is shooting a Western a couple miles down the street already dressed in-costume, it doesn't hurt to have Charlize Theron make a phone call and summoned you over. MacFarlane has been fortune enough to work with some talented actors in the past through Family Guy or other endeavours, and it shows that he never forgot them.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
140,priyantha-bandara,West was never this hilariously lethal,7,18 October 2014,Hay the American West was bad and we know it. But I never knew it was this hilariously bad. This movie picks up some obvious facts from the 18's USA and sums it up to be a predictable yet a very funny comedy. With cocky dirty humor without limits and sarcasm written all over it the people who can digest this will certainly like it.Albert (Seth MacFarlane) who is a cowardly sheep farmer and a man with a big broken heart after his girlfriend dumped him decides that it's finally time to leave the pathetic small town he was living in the West. But soon he is touched by the mysterious Anna (Charlize Theron) who happens to arrive in the town. But he is yet to realize that Anna is full of surprises and most of them will get him killed.A Millions Ways to Die in the West is a very straight forward comedy and I take it to be positive. Comedies should be light weighted and should have little surprises. All the fans want is to have a good time watching it and get back to their not so hilarious lives in a jiffy. This movie does its job well though it may not be crowned as the best comedy ever produced. Scene after scene it throws in some really hilarious lines and some of them are so funny that you might lose the next few lines while laughing.Acting wise there is plenty to laugh about and definitely Theron proves that she is a stunner even in vintage clothing and natural looking makeup. There are quite a few surprising appearances of guest casts who are well known who are capable of raising a brow. All in all this movie packs some real funny goodies and some of them might taste like horse s... But it's okay!!,A Million Ways to Die in the West

Albert (McFarlane) a cowardly farmer is ditched by his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) and is replaced by TV's boy-toy Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). The lost lover falls for the new girl in town aka Anna (Charlize Theron) who conveniently happens to be the wife of Clinch (Liam Neeson) aka one of the meanest gunmen in the west.Seth McFarlane requires no fluffed up intro. He is the gag master. He is well known for crude humor and has proved himself to be quite the successful comedian in his longstanding show THE FAMILY GUY. McFarlane who gave us the hilarious R rated comedy TED is at it again trying to make a farce of the lifestyles of the Wild West. AMWDW can be classified as a lesser funny motion picture with comparison to TED but still has its moments. The sheepishly written AMWDW reads deep into the characters immediately connecting with audience. Its comedy is slapstick and often revolves around blatant sarcasm. Blatant sarcasm is a tool often used by McFarlane in his work and he indeed executes them to fearless precision as the protagonist. Maybe it's because he feels the screenplay more closely to him as it his own creation or maybe because he is just good at the whole entertaining an audience business. Whilst Neil Patrick Harris and Giovanni Ribisi are the only seasoned stars of the genre, Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried and Especially Liam Neeson put on a show that can brighten up your lazy movie weekend.One of the favorable aspects of the production is the detailed set piece of the movie. The Saloon, the entertainment house and the farm which personifies the sex jokes make the township and Albert's soppy love story bearable. Whilst not all jokes are as crude as one may believe AMWDW survives the near 2 hours. Certain frames with insertions of pieces from BACK TO THE FUTURE and DJANGO UNCHANGED too will entertain those who know their movies.Seth McFarlane's AMWDW is a concentration of crude joke after joke.

143,a.lampert,Funniest western since Blazzing Saddles,9,18 May 2020,"I seem to be in the minority here and probably a different age group, the upper one. Raised on westerns, my favourite source of drama in films, I have avoided this movie because of poor reviews and poor box office. I watched it last night, mainly to see Charlize Theron and was amazed how much I loved it. It opened with majestic scenes of what I took to be Monument Valley, used to such great success by John Ford in his classic westerns with John Wayne. My thoughts went almost immediately to Blazzing Saddles for comparisons, although it is much cruder but I'm used to that now in modern entertainment. Strangely I don't usually like vulgarity in humour but for some reason I overlooked it in this movie. That may be
due to the likeable performances from Seth MacFarlane and Theron. Amongst all the sillyness is a completely straight performance by Liam Neeson playing his best violent persona which is another reason why I found it worked. I never realised MacFarlane was the same actor who made Ted, which I really didn't like and for me the crude humour in that was everything I don't like about modern entertainment. Why I forgave him that for this picture is a riddle. Still, I really didn't want this film to finish. I loved the relationship build-up between MacFarlane and Theron and the supporting actors, the violent gags and the cinematography were terrific. Perhaps you have to be an old time western fan to enjoy and sadly it's a bygone genre to modern audiences judging by other comments here. 9 stars from me for the most entertaining movie of the year for me so far.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

I think I'd have taken a stricter view if I paid serious bucks to see this on the big screen.There are the usual fart jokes, toilet humour, ethnic and religious jibes, and overt sexual gags you expect from Macfarlane. Modern-day comedy lines juxtaposed with the clichéd 'man's man' dialogue of the time works well, especially when Liam Neeson is on screen, playing a very straight role.

148,FilmMuscle,A Million Ways To Enjoy This Western-Comedy,6,3 June 2014,"Well, I guess either people are being overly negative about the film or entering a movie with low expectations really is the best way to go. AMWTDITW (as it shall be abbreviated since the title is too damn long!) centers around Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane), a sheep farmer who plainly isn't fitted for the wild, wild West. After his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfriend) breaks up with him and the days of desperation and failure in getting her back, Albert really, really seeks to leave for San Francisco and live a calmer life. However, he chooses to put those plans behind for a little longer when he meets a gorgeous newcomer to the town (Charlize Theron) and from there on, all hell breaks loose as the protagonist is forced into the standard character-developing arc. After all the brutal criticism I've heard of this picture, I have to honestly disagree with some major aspects. Seth MacFarlane's performance is actually completely fine, and aside from his over- exaggerated reactions to violence, he effectively blends in with the overwhelmingly exceptional cast (featuring the likes of Liam Neeson, Charlize Theron, Sarah Silverman, Neil Patrick Harris, Amanda Seyfriend, and Giovanni Ribisi). His character (Albert Stark) is very intriguing—a man, as I've already mentioned, who blatantly hates his environment and doesn't belong in the midst of all the obnoxiousness that permeates it. He's not the big, tough gunslinger/killer that most men out on the frontier seem to be. Never does he try to appear brave and audacious, instead hiding behind the crowd at the sign of any imposing situation. It's seriously refreshing; the film doesn't possess that formulaic, predictable plot where the protagonist of the tale suddenly turns into a valiant victor by its end. Moreover, Liam Neeson shines as the menacing villain of the narrative, and it was quite smart to cast Liam ""I will find you and I will kill you"" Neeson in this role since you understand just how intimidating and badass the guy is as soon as pops up on-screen —no need to prove it even though he does several times. Now—look—the premise, alone, is undoubtedly unique. I admittedly liked the film better than Ted, which I was fairly disappointed with after hearing the endless praise. Whereas Ted primarily relied on tired and outdated pop culture references, there was a bit more diversity in the humor here. Yes, you do get your customary potty humor within (plentiful of poop and fart jokes; I must say though that I cracked up at one in particular due to its sheer vulgarity and severity), but you surprisingly also get some clever ones every once in a while with MacFarlane's usual snarky humor. The western-comedy never truly reaches laugh-out-loud territory, but I already knew not to expect much after witnessing MacFarlane's directorial debut, Ted. In addition, we should, at least, applaud Seth and the studio for being daring and artistic enough to produce a western (which we all know isn't exactly the most successful genre in Hollywood nowadays) in original fashion. Thanks to its concept (as the title very clearly explains—the unexpected violence and death never ends), the film remained largely entertaining throughout, no matter the amount of flat jokes. With that being said, the movie does feel a little on the longer side with a certain prolonged, totally random sequence towards the end that felt almost unnecessary—a segment so extravagant that it gives you the impression it was solely made as an excuse to showcase all the CGI action and wildness that wouldn't have made sense in the story itself. Don't worry; you'll know when you see it. On another note, there was a fair share of cringe-worthily corny moments that were fortunately shaded by some clever maneuvers in the script, ultimately surprising me with a witty punch line. All in all, AMWTDITW amounts to a fun night out. Even if you're not blown away by its jokes, there's still plenty to enjoy, including a fair share of hilarious cameos that should not be spoiled (and yes, they're used to better effect in comparison to Ted's).",A Million Ways to Die in the West

It's as if a bunch of dirty-minded, foul-mouth juveniles got together and decided to make a movie and put in it every goofy, dirty, idiotic, dumb idea and utterance they could think of. And they must have because here is plainly the result. What a colossal waste of talent. I don't know how long this took to film but everyone in it could have made better use of their time had they stood around and chucked rocks down a sink hole. Seth MacFarlane as writer, director, producer and so-called actor of this unfunny, boring mess has proved with this one undertaking that he is a quadruple waste of time.

150,Vincent_B,Actually Better Than Ted,5,25 November 2014,"This Seth MacFarlane film is the same comedic style; sex, drugs, racism, and bathroom humor. So why did I say it is ""better"" than Ted? Unlike Ted this adult humor film doesn't pander to children the same way that the man's cartoons and magic talking teddy bear does. Call me a prude, if you like. I have issue with anyone who wraps something visually attractive to a child, which in all reality is meant for an adult.I see other people expected this movie to be a gut buster. I haven't found many old western comedies to be gut busters. This is not Mel Brook's ""Blazing Saddles"", John Astin ""Evil Roy Slade"", or even Don Knotts ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"". Even Kirk Douglas in ""The Villain"" is better than this camp. While all these movies and more have entertained, none are what I call a gut buster.The plot is overtly obvious, the jokes are retold and recycled, but I appreciate the effort made by the cast and crew to make an adult western comedy. Most of the story is a love story or love triangle told inside a comedy. It seems they could not decide to be serious or funny, both seldom works. ""Blazing Saddles"" worked because nothing was taken serious right down to breaking the fourth wall.I hope Mr. MacFarlane will continue to make adult comedies for the big screen and not adult cartoons on TV.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

However when I finally watched the movie, I was pleasantly surprised. Little jokes were keeping the audience in a good mood which reached a zenith (spoiler alert!) with the appearance of Dr.Emmett Brown from Back to the future! The movie consists of a modern person's view of the far west past. Although mentioned in light-ironic way, it still rose to me some questions about the every day reality of the far west. Were women ugly as Miss America 1880, was the life expectancy 35? was a mustache trendy? Seth Mac Farlane first time acting in front of camera is doing a good job. It is really a pity he only used to work in the back of the camera and I would like to see more of him in the future. The presence of Neil Patrick Harris is funny as usual and the rest of the crew is good as well.It is certainly not a blockbuster, but still is standing well as a good movie.

152,vistheindian,Simply disappointing,6,31 May 2014,"Quickie Review:After the massive success of Ted, director Seth MacFarlane returns to make another comedy feature film, in which he is also the star. His character, Albert, lives in the West where everything and everyone is deadly. He loses his love Louise (Amanda Seyfried) to Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). With the help of gun-slinging Anna (Charlize Theron) he must duel Foy in a gunfight to win his love back. A Million Ways to Die in the West, is a satirical comedy western that unfortunately does not deliver consistent quality of jokes. You will chuckle a few times sure, but as a whole this is not MacFarlane's best work. Quite frankly this a poor movie that has been advertised in the trailers with all the best jokes.Full Review:I enjoy MacFarlane's work in Family Guy and I especially loved Ted. So going in I was quite excited to see A Million Ways to Die in the West. However, by the second half I realized I was actually bored. It pains to me to say this because I really like Seth MacFarlane's sense of humor, but this was just not a good movie.This is the first time we see MacFarlane in a live action lead role. We know he is good with voice work for animated characters but as a live action actor he's not at the same level of quality. He actually feels out of place, it's more like he is in some skit show. In fact, the whole movie feels like a series of skits, each scene is just set up for a gag. It gets so lost in making all these gags work that there is no coherent flow to the story. This makes an already 2 hour long movie feel longer because you just don't know where it's going, and more importantly the jokes aren't even that funny.This brings me to the biggest let down of this movie, the jokes. Yes of course there are few chuckles here and there, but even the worst comedies has those. At no point was I bursting with laughter. Later on in the movie, it starts to rely on the dick, fart and poop jokes. Sure, once in a while I can enjoy those jokes, but if the whole scene is depending on that to get some laughter, then I'm switching my brain off because clearly the writers have too. You know they ran out of ideas when they resort to the laxative gag. Dear Hollywood, stop it with the laxative joke, it was funny when I was kid.Apart from the scenes from the trailer, there is one cameo and a bar fight that I quite enjoyed watching. I think anyone going in with big expectations based on Ted will be sorely disappointed. There are definitely worse comedies out there than this. Still, considering the team and cast involved, A Million Ways to Die in the West should have been so much better.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

155,ahegde3149,Boring mostly with very few awesome scenes here and there.,3,13 January 2015,"'A Million Ways to Die in the West' is probably longest title I have seen recently, similar to the title the movie also drags on unnecessarily for almost 2 hours. I am not so familiar with Seth MacFarlen who tries pull out an all round actor-director-writer in this one, but fails to shine in any of the departments. The likes of Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron are wasted in this boring encounter.Set in 1882, the story revolves around Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane) who is a coward sheep farmer who thinks less of himself. After being dumped by his girlfriend he no longer wishes to stay in the west where there is death everywhere and million possibles ways one can die including diseases, fights, snakebites and what not. Then he meets Anna (Charlize Theron) wife of notorious outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) of which Albert is not aware of. Albert comes to know that his girlfriend is now with rich businessman Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) leading to more depression.Anna decides to help out him by playing his girlfriend to make his earlier girlfriend jealous. Well like always the acting of love gets converted into real love and then the villain husband comes to know leading to a face of at the end. I think this film does a better job as romantic film than as comedy. The slow pacing works that way. Still the story is very predictable. Unpredictable things still do happen here and there to induce more of jump-humor like there are jump-scares in horror, which was interesting. Yet the characters are quite one-dimensional despite being weird so the actors seem nothing much special.Despite being overall bad, there were some memorable scenes which save this one from ultimate travesty like the sequence Albert dreams when he gets high towards the end. Also there a cameo of character you may have known from another western-themed film at the end of movie which was the most hilarious scene in the whole movie.The background music is also quite atmospheric. There is not much of witty humor and more of toilet-humor filled with profanity and absurdity. Lovers of all that may have a good time with this one, but the others will find it senseless and boring. So there will be a million ways to avoid this film, which I feel I should have done now.RATING: [1.5/5]",A Million Ways to Die in the West

As bad as Movie 43, the infamous reference of dreadfulness since 2013.The newest absolute zero of cinema is called Seth MacFarlane. He has made this turd, so we all know what that makes him. The so-called comedy is a combination of fart jokes, poop jokes, bowels jokes and scrotum jokes. That's right: another grown-up with the writing skills of a 12 year old loser.

With the screen presence and the charisma of a door knob, he talks and talks and talks incessantly, and swears like a contemporary Californian kid trying to impress a teenager.To temper my unequivocal judgment, I'll add that the movie has absolutely no redeeming quality.

It would be easy for one to assume that this film would follow in their funny footsteps......BUTUnfortunately it doesn't. In fact it comes nowhere near. It is poor, very poor. It does bring out a few laughs but overall it comes across desperate and shows in abundance that Seth MacFarlane should physically stay away from the big screen. He has a great voice, but his acting ability is terrible. I honestly think that in some cases shutting your eyes makes the film slightly better when he's on screen. His facial expressions are nauseating to watch as he so eagerly tries to gain affirmation. Maybe he wants to be more than a voice. So he has positioned himself as a leading man. I truly think this will be his first, and last outing as that. There are decent performances by others, but in the end it falls flat on its face.There is so much about it that seems like it is plagiarizing Family Guy, but Family Guy has its own iconic stature and should not be replicated or transitioned away from animation.

In the wild west, a sheep farmer called Albert is about to leave to San Francisco when he saves a woman called Anna from being crushed to death, and so they become friends. Anna teaches Albert how to shoot good with a gun, as Albert cannot shoot very well with one, and they practice lots. Now, that isn't too bad of a starting to a film, is it? The film is pretty much good the whole way through.Anyway, it turns out the Anna was also friends with a criminal, and so Albert loses his trust in her.

160,midas-jacobs,"Not good, not bad, just mediocre",5,29 July 2016,"""A Million ways to die in the west"" is about... Well that's a good question. There isn't a story. If I had to verbalize it I would do it like this: The movie is about a nobody who trains to get back his girlfriend. That's the best I could do.No that that is out of the way, luckily, let's start with this paragraph of my review. Here I will talk about the technical stuff (directing cinematography and so on), the paragraph where I talk about the actors is the next one, and in the one thereafter is about the script and characters. So how was the directing? Good. It had some really bad shots, but this was weighted by the good scenes. There were nice aerial shots used. The directing was done by the person who also plays the main character: Seth MacFarlane. The cinematographer managed to frame the landscape very well. This just helped to make the movie better. This was done by Michael Barrett. The editing wasn't so great though. For example: In the beginning there was the dialogue between Albert and Louise where she is breaking up with him. This scene was edited way to rapidly and just made the scene hard to watch. On a small not, this was also not a well directed scene. There wasn't a lot of variation in shots (they only used the same two perspectives) The soundtrack was better. It helped to portray a western atmosphere, but it also had some funny songs. The green screen, when used, was very noticeable, but I believe that this was the point, for comedic purposes. But this failed because that scene felt out of place and unnecessary.The acting was just bad. I don't mean horrible but just bad. There were a couple of fine ones but those are rare. Let's start of with the main actor. Like I said this was Albert, played by Seth MacFarlane. He was one of the worst ones. I didn't like his character (more on this in the next paragraph) and the bad acting didn't make it better. That's a great start isn't it? The antagonists are both Clinch and Foy. Clinch was played by Liam Neeson and Foy by Neil Patrick Harris. They probably only casted Neeson because they needed a generic bad guy and that's where he's good at. Neil Patrick Harris was just fine as Foy. Albert also get's another love interest - what a surprise huh? - this was Anna played by Charlize Theron. She was the best of them all, mostly because she wasn't annoying, but also because she is a good actress. In this role she was just fine. Alberts first girlfriend was Louise by Amanada Seyfried. She was also bad, but MacFarlane apparently liked her, because they also worked together on ""Ted 2""The script wasn't great either. The movie was built kind of similar to ""Ted"", but this movie just failed to deliver. There were tons of jokes in the movie, but only a few of them made me laugh. These moments were mostly slapstick or some verbal jokes. There were also - surprise surprise - sh*t and fart jokes. Come on! stop using them they were not funny. For a six year old kid, maybe, but this movie is directed to another, more mature audience, hence the R-rating. So why put in such a lazy joke that isn't even funny? Seth MacFarlane, who also wrote the script, casted himself as the main actor. That says enough. He wants to come over as a likable guy, because he often uses humor that is offensive to some people. This only made me not like the character of Albert even more. Which is by the way a terrible character in the first place. He was very cliché and badly developed. MacFarlane wants you to care about him, but just fails at it. The other characters weren't well developed either. Liam Neeson didn't have any motivation. He was just bad to be bad. The only characters I found funny were Edward, played by Giovanni Ribisi, and his wife. These two had funny chemistry and the job of his wife just made it more funny .The story, like I said, feels absent. You have Albert trying to get his girl, Louise, back, but there is also a forced in story-line with Liam Neeson. We meet him in the beginning of the movie and then forget about him, but when the plot needs him he comes back.So in short this wasn't a good movie. The directing, soundtrack and cinematography saved it, because the acting and writing just were plain bad. This isn't a movie that you should hate, but for me it's certainly not one I will remember. So that's why I will be giving this movie a 5.4/10.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

163,mjplysaght,MacFarlane's ego takes centre stage,4,7 February 2017,"Being accustomed to the disjointed narrative and toilet humour of Family Guy, I was pretty positive that content of a similar nature would be present in this film. Sure enough, I was right. But what I found the most insulting about this film is just how uninspired and boring it is, once you really look at it.MacFarlane plays a complete wuss living in the Wild West. Already it is a clichéd fish-out-of-water story. His girlfriend has left him for a more classy gentleman and he proceeds to act like a cynical jackass for the majority of the film.Liam Neeson plays a bandit (also the only person in the Wild West with a Northern Irish accent) and orders his wife (Charlize Theron) to wait for him in MacFarlane's village. She spends time with MacFarlane teaching him to become more masculine and to adapt more in the current setting. She also teaches him to stand up for himself. So, obviously MacFarlane falls for her and they fall in love, although conflict arises when Liam Neeson comes back. Ultimately, good triumphs over evil. The end.There is no attempt to make this plot seem engaging. The amount of wasted actors in this film taking a step back just so MacFarlane can stroke his ego is just not fair. Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, Neil Patrick Harris, Charlize Theron, Sarah Silverman, Giovanni Ribisi? This impressive cast has to humour MacFarlane as he simply tries and fails to act? Don't get me wrong, the guy's talented as an animator, singer and voice-over artist, but as far as acting in live-action goes, he misses the mark here in every possible way.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
164,feyipuk,Inverse Family Guy,4,29 June 2017,"As pretty much every other review on here starts: Seth MacFarlane is known for his voice work on Family Guy (as well as creating/writing/directing), and it seems odd to see him, rather than hear him coming out from one of his animated characters. And maybe that's why this feels like an overly long Family Guy episode. MacFarlanes character here - Albert - could have been replaced with Brian the dog from Family Guy and delivered most of the same lines, without too big a change in the story. They could have even joked about a dog being a sheep farmer or introduced O'Brian, the sheep that belongs to Peter Griffin's dad. One scene has Albert talking to Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) about ""What is there to live for on the frontier in 1882?"" It goes on so long that I actually cheered when someone else says ""Why don't you shut up?"" I was half expecting the Family Guy rooster to appear and start a massively over the top fight scene, except one of the main premises of the film is Albert not wanting to fight. Edward and Ruth (Sarah Silverman) make a cute/innocent couple, and given her line of work as a prostitute (yep, she gets to talk about her genitals), the set up is: as good Christians they're saving themselves for after marriage. Alex Borstein (the voice of Lois Griffin) has a brief appearance simply to have a discussion about anal sex. Given MacFarlanes apparent need to talk about religion when ever possible (he's an atheist and talking about religion is very important to him), there are plenty of other jokes that go along similar lines. Likewise, you have the standard Family Guy gross out physical humour, including a couple of deaths - the film is called a Million Way to Die in the West - played for laughs.Neil Patrick Harris basically plays the same character he does in How I Met Your Mother, just replacing suits with another crutch. Amanda Seyfried is a pastiche of her previous roles, right down to being lampooned about her appearance in one scene.Wes Studi is yet again playing a stereotype, more in line with Mystery Men than Avatar or Dances With Wolves.Instead of Star Wars references, there's a cameo by Christopher Lloyd (no prizes for guessing which role he's reprising), as well as a comedic pause thanks to Bill Maher, and a couple of blink and you miss them cameos from Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool), Kaley Cuoco (The Big Bang Theory), Rodney Carrington (Rodney) and Patrick Stewart (American Dad...and other shows), though you can't miss Jamie Foxx reprising one of his former characters.The best characters, are the bad characters. Charlize Theron does a good Annie Oakley impression, while Liam Neeson possesses a particular set of skills, though their actual reason for being in the film does get a little lost behind other relationships.The musical score is good (again, not surprising, given Family Guy uses an orchestra for every episode) and the scenery is stereotypical for the movie old west.I watched it on terrestrial TV, and ten minutes in I was looking to see if Family Guy or American Dad was on on another channel.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

166,YJLcool,An truly disappointing comedy film from Seth MacFarlane,5,22 June 2014,"Riding on the success of Ted, Seth MacFarlane returns to direct, write, produce a Western romantic comedy film, in which he is also the main lead as well. While I was immensely entertained by his previous film about a grown man who has to deal with a foul-mouthed, beer-drinking, obsessive talking teddy bear, it's a shame the same couldn't be said this time around. This has to be one of the most unfunny and overexplained 'comedy' film that's filled with so many unnecessary and overextended scenes I have seen for quite some time.The story is rather simple: A film that sets in the West around the year of 1882 with a cowardly, pessimistic shepherd who gets dumped by his long-time girlfriend because he's too much of a wuss, later on meets and falls in love with a beautiful, mysterious, hot new badass woman in town, who also teaches him how to use a gun and find the courage to become a man up to win the girl of his dreams.The film suffers from a huge problem: It features a lot random crude jokes that just aren't funny at all. Seriously, I don't find it particularly funny (but utterly shocked, not in a good way) when a guy gets crushed with ice or when a guy suddenly gets pierced by a rampaging bull out of nowhere. Is sheep peeing at your face or finding sheepshit or horseshit under your pillow in the morning look funny to you? Do we really need to repeatedly see a virgin guy keeps on asking her prostitute girlfriend to have sex with him? Do we really need to listen to a guy who keeps on explaining and show that he does not belong in the West?During plot development, the film also seems to completely forgets to keep the audience laugh or feel entertained. It's so serious or got caught up in explaining the plot details that they failed to include any witty or slapstical dialogues/scenes. The film has so many weird, out- of-place cameo appearances from many actors: Ryan Reynolds, Ewan McGregor, Jamie Foxx, Bill Maher and Christopher Lloyd (what the hell? seriously?) which doesn't fit in the film at all. It just keeps you wondering the whole time why those scenes are even included in the film. The film also features an unnecessary, out-of-place dream sequence brought on by the American Indian drugs that adds nothing much to the story.Furthermore, Seth MacFarlane's gives a weird acting performance that doesn't seem natural...his character just doesn't have that defining personality for the audience to root for. The film's only saving grace is the romance between the leads. Charlize Theron does share a decent chemistry with Seth MacFarlane in the film that carries the film through the end. Their relationship is properly developed and fleshed out.While it's not the worst film ever, it's an extremely disappointing film despite its hidden potential. Some might find this film funny and enjoyable, but for me, it's a huge letdown.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/06 Rating: 5.5/10",A Million Ways to Die in the West
167,tord-1,One of the better modern Wild West movies!,8,8 October 2015,"Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, and the rest of the crew makes this a lovely movie, written and directed by the lead actor, Seth MacFarlane,It does have its weak spots, but overall, an enjoyable movie, crammed with nods to a lot of classic Wild West classics.Amanda Seyfried, and Neil Patrick Harris do excellently in their supporting roles, but the scene stealer is Giovanni Ribisi, without a doubt!Liam Neeson, and his wife (in this film) Charlize Theron, domainates most of their scenes, as does the Indians, who kidnaps the lead character.In short, a delightful surprise!",A Million Ways to Die in the West
168,moviescoundrel,A Few Funny Scenes in the West,6,25 June 2014,"After critical consensus came back rather low from this one, I once again lowered the standards bar before seeing this one. I expected very little, and was moderately surprised. The plot is rather weak, and the characters don't really develop, but what we see from them throughout the film is amusing and sometimes hilarious. It is a hard R-rated movie (see content below) and there are some parts that are hi-freaking-larious because of that. Some of the humor helps put the west in a whole new perspective. Ribsi and Silverman are decent as supporting cast members and I wish they were in it a bit more. The ending gets carried away a bit, I would have rather watched more weird scenarios in which people randomly died in the wild west, but oh well.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

170,RubyMouse,Why all the hate?,7,28 June 2018,"I'm a bit confused over the hate for this movie. Yes it's juvenile and a bit gross and the humour sometimes misfires - it's Seth MacFarlane folks, it is what it is! I personally don't usually like this kind of humour but my Dad was a massive western fan and I watched it because of that and loved the tongue in cheek references/send up of the genre. There are lots of fun moments for anyone who remembers those old westerns, there are lots of silly jokes, a good soundtrack, amusing cameos and the cast are clearly having a great time. It's a thoroughly enjoyable movie overall as long as you don't expect it to be Shakespeare.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
171,sujanfaster,Another movie whose fun in only limited to the trailer,6,9 September 2014,"The poster says, ""From the guy that brought you Ted"". Saying that alone this movie creates a lot of hype. I am a fan of Seth McFarlane and I like his brand of comedy that was in Ted. But the problem with this film is when McFarlane that it is just another rom-com film that could have been made even in PG-13.The name of the movie itself is misleading. The movie is not about Million Ways of dying(at least showing that in different ways would have been funnier). It is about a loser/coward who ends up winning the girl and killing the villain(as in so many other movies that we have seen). There are some funny moments but that does not make up to the age old script. Seth McFarnale doesn't have to do much for playing this role and same applies for Charlize Theron as well. Sarah Silverman and Giovani Ribbissi are genuinely funny. Being a Liam Neeson fan I am not happy with him taking this role. There are some interesting cameos in the film. Other than some funny ways of dying which w have already seen in the trailer, the film doesn't offer you much. So Seth McFarlane, I'm gonna excuse you for this one.

173,MovieSonic,Definitely worth watching but won't blow you away,7,5 September 2014,"I'd give this 6.5/10 so I've rounded up to 7. It had an iffy start and I was tempted to turn it off but then after ten minutes it started to get really funny and stayed funny for ages.I would say that the majority of the film is averagely funny with a fair few highlights. Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman were hilarious.Here's what I thought could have been improved:-- Better editing - a couple of jokes were left in that should have been removed and a couple of scenes should have been cut down or edited out.-- There was slight over-use of one joke in particular whereby it was done, it was over and then later in the film it was rehashed (the one with Silverman/Ribisi).-- The humour of this film focuses mainly on the only type of joke Seth MacFarlane does that I don't really like - the 'commentary' humour as I've termed it. By this I mean, something happens and it would be funny if there were a well-timed reaction shot or response but instead, Seth likes to just narrate what has happened in a sarcastic way which to me, isn't funny. It probably was the first or second time he did it on Family Guy but it's not funny anymore. However, there were a few scenes where he just reacted to something or gave a response and it was genuinely hilarious.I really enjoyed the scenes with Liam Neeson but I wish he (and Seth) had put some effort into doing a different accent.Neil Patrick Harris was hilarious and I thought he committed really well to everything he was made to do! That laugh of his!I also liked the way the relationship between Seth and Charlize Theron developed. It felt really natural and so I believed that they would fight for each other.There were other things wrong / right with the film and ultimately it was worth a watch for the many hilarious scenes, just don't expect perfection.7/10",A Million Ways to Die in the West
174,stephenlovelette,The Summer of Spoiling Trailers,6,12 August 2014,"Why get your hopes up?It won't help.A Million Ways to Die in the West contains several genuine laughs and a number of chuckles. Don't sully them with high expectations.Have you seen the trailer? Hence the anticipation.The preview spoils the majority of jokes, reveals and cameos. Wait a year before renting.This is the type of comedy where, if you're viewing with only a vague recollection of my dissatisfaction, there's a shot at enjoyment.John DeFore, a writer for Huff Po, suggests a, ""mid-film cameo prompts viewers to wonder how MacFarlane might have fared playing a time-traveler from our era stranded in the Old West. Instead, his 1880s sheep farmer Albert Stark simply talks like someone born in and transplanted from the 20th century.""DeFore's analysis couldn't be more accurate.Albert feels like a stand-up comedian; a prisoner in the Old West who attempts to gain freedom through wacky frontier material.The problem isn't a fun topic for discussion, because Seth MacFarlane deserves our respect.Celebrities only have nice things to say about him. He's one of the greatest contributors to contemporary comedy, offering quality on both the small screen (The Family Guy) and in the box office (Ted). As host of the 2013 Oscars, he delivered a bang-up performance.Therefore, it's unpleasant mentioning the weakness of his performance, and how it detracts from the film overall.For whatever reason, his acting isn't up to snuff.Harping on it won't do any good. Chalk up the loss to over-ambition.A $40 million budget isn't enormous for this type of production. And Seth's trying to write, direct and star in the biggest comedic western since Blazing Saddles. That includes flying the ensemble cast/production crew, building sets and shooting on location, while using horses, dancers and maybe guns (plus all the necessary advisors/extras.)Fun fact: Liam Neeson's the only cast member who rode horseback across the tarmac, up the steps and onto a private, horse-bearing jet. Apparently Neeson goes nowhere without his nag.That's a joke. But you can see how a budget dries up relatively quick.By the way, the supporting cast is what makes this movie good. Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman and Amanda Seyfried are great.Charlize Theron and Neil Patrick Harris are fantastic. Charlize is so impressive; she prevents the movie from becoming a 'thumbs-down.'N.P.H. plays a hilarious villain and is such an incredible talent that he manages to cultivate hysteria from an unfunny scatological bit.Aside from Neil and Charlize, the best part is an original song.If nothing else, at least give, ""If You've Only Got a Mustache,"" a listen.All in all, AMWTDITW is not a complete success.Nor is it a complete disappointment.Let it simmer on the backburner.You'll thank me later.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

It hits more than it misses but the movie could have been better if it had been 1hr 30 and the story being a bit more eventful.

I saw this at a opening night showing and I had my doubts, praying that it wasn't going to be bad like ""Wild Wild West"". Thankfully, this far exceeded my expectations. After watching it, I'm almost certain that the critics took this film way too seriously!The plot is thin at times, but what do you expect from a comedy made by the creator of Family Guy? Anyways, the movie takes place in the west where our hero tells his friends all the ways to die (hence the title) and hilarity ensues. The acting is well done, the characters are memorable, and the jokes actually worked. The movie went by so fast, even though it was slightly less than two hours.Time to wrap things up. If you go in with the right attitude, you are going to love this movie. This was completely entertaining from start to finish, I never felt boredom during the experience of watching this in a theater. Everyone in the audience was having fun and the cameos are absolutely hilarious. Since it just came out, grab some friends and see this when you get the chance.

177,Paul-271,"Some Hits, Some Misses",5,14 May 2015,"This would have been a much better flick had it reduced the number of gags in it. Not just any gags but the childish bathroom humor which forms a sort of patter between the winner jokes, visuals and gags. I suppose 12 year old boys would find laughable some guy defecating into a hat in front of a crowd but for anybody who isn't a weak minded 12 year old boy it's just tedious. Silverman, who has a lot of unrealized potential should she be properly directed, chews the scenery as a prostitute who regularly screams out details about her work. Theron is the high point of the movie looking wonderful in her western outfit and exuding a certain tough sweetness that's enormously endearing. MacFarlane himself plays the lead like a young Charles Grodin - a fine choice to imitate for the role. Others do a workmanlike job. The one daring visual gag is the 'escaped slave' routine but the movie wimped out at the end showing you can't insult certain groups who have political power and are expert at feigning outrage. Very likely had this been directed by anybody else, it'd have had the junk cut, but MacFarlane is suffering from Woody Allen disease - he has to control all to the detriment of the whole.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
178,fluturoj,Funny,7,2 July 2016,"I was surprised by this movie in a very good way. I did not expect it to be this good. I found it very funny and what I think made it funny was that it showed the 21th century in 1800s. To explain, the language they use and the expressions are the same ones they use today so there was no attempt to adjust them to the time period which made the movie very funny. The story line is also very interesting. I expected it that the Albert is going to win in the end but I I did not foresee how which made it quite interesting. Albert is a very lovable character. I loved how he was different from what was common in the West and did not care what other people thought about him. What I also loved was Ryan Reynolds' appearance in the movie just to get killed. I loved that part and laughed aloud. Overall this movie is quite enjoyable. It is funny and has an interesting story line. I would recommend it.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
179,shinsrevenge,Peter Griffin in the wild west,7,29 August 2015,"When I hear Seth MacFarlane I think of ""Family Guy"" and I found quite some similarities between Albert and Peter Griffin. They even have a similar kind of ""humor"" like exploding heads, cum on face and a man filling hats with fecal... None of them were funny and some were rather disgusting and needless.Nevertheless I rather enjoyed the rest of the movie apart from the mentioned scenes. Albert struggles with his own doubts and inabilities to prove himself worthy. To him and to his girlfriend, who ran away. Anna, the wife of the outlaw Clinch, helps Albert built up his self esteem. Clinch is played by Liam Neeson, who is a great actor but only has a minor role here. He is the main reason I wanted to watch the movie and his performance is top-notch. A ruthless bad-ass.Seth MacFarlane included a lot of funny things and references in this movie. I liked the part where he finds ""Doc"" Brown with his time machine from ""Back to the future 3"" in a barn. Altogether it was a good movie, worth 7/10.

And I enjoyed this movie, period.It's a long way from the polished, chock-full parody of BLAZING SADDLES or other Mel Brooks films, but still worth watching. I'm looking forward to the next viewing since I missed the first ten minutes or so, and undoubtedly missed a few jokes among the parts I did see.I have only one regret -- that they didn't spend an extra six months on the writing, or even hired a few more writers, which might have brought it up to the Mel Brooks level.

185,DJ_Shilo,Danger in the West,5,16 October 2018,"Fresh from the success of ""Ted,"" Seth MacFarlane comes out from behind the camera for ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" and gets the acting bug. ""Ted"" is the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time and if he thinks this picture is going to top that, he needs to think again.It's about a cowardly man, Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane) who is dumped by his gold-digging girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried). After his attempt to move to San Francisco backfires, he is left with his friend, Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and his prostitute girlfriend, Ruth (Sarah Silverman). His life takes a change when he saves a woman, Anna (Charlize Theron) and she teaches him how to stand up for himself. Little does Albert know, she is on the run from her infamous outlaw husband, Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson).""Ted"" made well over $500 million two years ago and I would not be surprised if this made no more than $100 million. Just because you have great success with one film doesn't mean the next will be the same and that's where Seth MacFarlane makes a mistake. I'm not saying this picture is terrible, but it's not the greatest or funniest comedy I have ever seen. I started to realize the movie but not be that good as it got closer to release. I figured it would be nothing but jokes and it is. However, it's nothing compared to what Adam Sandler throws at us with brain-dead comedies like ""The Waterboy,"" Mr. Deeds"" & ""Billy Madison."" Seth is known for taking offensive material such as his ""Family Guy"" show and trying to make people laugh with it. I do find Peter Griffin humorous sometimes because he's an idiot, but I find the show stupid because it repeats itself over and over again with the same fart jokes, sex jokes and bodily fluid jokes that are not funny and because it's always the same, it's a pointless waste of time. The idea of this film is that it's based on the old frontier where anything can kill you. This is a good concept, but Seth dumps the film into the same jokes ""Family Guy"" is known for, and it's not funny. It's now clear that he likes to take the easy and cheap route at humour and if that is the case, he's not as smart as I thought he was.It's sad that he takes the lazy way out, but that says nothing about his performance. This is the first time he steps out from behind the camera, and as an actor, I didn't really have a problem with him. This will probably be the only time we see him as an actor because I'm almost sure that this picture will bomb at the box office. He repeatedly points out that anything in the wild west can kill you: cholera, wolves, stomach gas ignited by your own farts and bandits. His characters are smart, and he shares good chemistry with Charlie Thereon, the only other intelligent role in the entire picture. Her name is Anna, and she sees the right heart in Albert and encourages him to be a better man. Now, this is not supposed to be a romantic comedy, but when the two characters share a moment in a romantic atmosphere, Seth feels the need to throw dick jokes in there. Liam Neeson is wasted as a murderous outlaw. We know nothing about this character because there are too many fart jokes that need to be launched instead of giving us a funny comedy that we can laugh at and not feel the same old cheap gags and jokes.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

187,KingProjector93,"Needed a Moustache, even when extended",6,28 December 2014,"From the creators of Ted and Family Guy comes a story about how sucky the Old West was. Macfarlane is Albert Stark, a loser-good guy-sheep farmer whose modesty and lack of spine lose him his girlfriend (Seyfried) to town jerk and moustache empresario Foy (Patrick Harris). However, all is not lost when a mysterious woman, Anna (Theron) arrives in town, and she and Albert begin to bond. Little does he know that she is the wife of notorious killer Clinch Leatherwood (The Son of God), who of course, is none too pleased about this development....Neither a gut busting success nor a miserable dud, 'Million Ways' is at times funny & inventive, and at others, cheap and phoned in. The key culprit here is the screenplay, which Macfarlane wrote with two other F.G. alumni; it's scattershot, both comically and structurally. It feels like they wrote two scripts for the film, then chopped them up and spliced them together; one is Albert having to learn courage and face up Leatherwood, who is only in at the beginning and end, disappearing for a large chunk of the film and diluting whatever threat he may have been. The other is Albert trying to win back his old girl from Foy, which takes dominance in the middle, but after that, it fizzles out from relevance. Both stories, from a narrative perspective, serve the exact same function, so the film could've been about one and it would've been the better, and shorter for it.Oh, and that's another problem; a lot of the humour, when it isn't pratfalls or gross outs, is either Albert or one of the characters talking about how much the West sucks. While not unfunny, this isn't a very cinematic form of comedy, and the pacing sags, especially in the middle, as a result of trying to accommodate the two plot lines as well as this. A pity because everything around it is actually rather solid, Macfarlane makes for a decent lead man and he's got a powerhouse cast behind him who all clearly had a ball with their roles. It's filmed really well with some legitimately beautiful vistas of the West, and Joel McNeely's score is tremendous. It's tongue in cheek but also legitimately majestic and moving in its own right, and is one of the most distinctive I've heard from a comedy in a very long time. Even the 'Moustache' song is really catchy and lively, and highlights just how when Macfarlane fires, he can create legitimate hilarity.As for the extended cut, it just amounts to some extended jokes during the first two acts, mainly expanding Albert's dating attempts after Seyfried's character dumps him. It's OK, but it's obvious why it got cut, as it doesn't really advance the story any further. In the end, 'Million Ways' held my attention, and had enough bright points to make it better than I thought it was going to be, but alas, this movie was really missing a proverbial 'moustache'.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

And if they are expecting a similar foul-mouthed rant in 'A Million Ways To Die In The West', they are right.The problem is, viewers will feel that he's trying too hard to make people fall under his spell again. I didn't feel like laughing out loud during the screening; I was more prone to emitting the occasional snort of laughter, much like the rest of the audience.MacFarlane is not afraid to mock Chinese, blacks and Christians, but you really feel him straining when you encounter a prostitute who services 15 men a day but is averse to having sex with her virgin boyfriend. You may feel him more than just straining when a woman places a daisy in the anus of a man she's just knocked out cold with a rock.Read more at: www.jeffleemovies.com",A Million Ways to Die in the West
193,namikazedante,A truly funny and cool western movie !,10,13 March 2016,"Okay first off. How can this movie have such a low rating? Come'on people. First off , what does this movie have? It has a goofy and likable character (Seth) and we got ourselves a good plot and story line. Great bad guys and it jokes about yeah everything. I am a huge fan of the western movies aka Clint Eastwood. And to see a more joking kind of movie in that sense is just fun to watch. And I didn't think much of this movie at first. Well I hadn't heard anything actually but I started watching it and I loved it. It is not a movie that take itself too serious and it has good jokes and cool character. It has all that the family guy and American dad TV shows should be all about but these days it seems like this is just watch Seth should do. Take more time to come up with something good like this movie. And for people who don't like western well heck I don't think it's a reason to hate on this movie. The jokes are modern and we have the classical story of boy is weak, meets a strong woman, bad guys come, and things gets crazy. I mean give the movie a shot before thinking oh boy look what a low score ...",A Million Ways to Die in the West
194,allexand,"Mel Brooks can rest easy cause this is no ""Blazing Saddles""",3,24 June 2014,"After the success of ""Ted,"" the movie industry expected big things from ""Family Guy"" creator Seth McFarlane, and of course, like so many of Hollywood's next-big-things before him, he failed to deliver.When I saw the trailers for this film, the scenes looked funny and since I enjoyed ""Ted,"" I thought I would enjoy this too. Little did I know that the best parts of the film were featured in its trailer.For starters, the movie recycles too many jokes from ""Family Guy."" Having watched it sporadically since its return to the airwaves in 2005, I could recognize every joke and scene that was patterned after a similar scene or joke from that show. It shouldn't have been a surprise that it was like this, what with Seth writing the film with his FG pals and ""Ted"" honestly having the same problem, but the difference is that ""Ted"" used pre-cancellation ""Family Guy"" humor while ""Million"" uses POST-cancellation humor and as most FG fans will tell you, that ain't a good thing.""Million"" left a bad taste in my mouth because it reminded me of everything I hated about ""Family Guy"" since about season five or so: jokes that are explained to the audience after delivery, shock humor that offends more than entertains, prolonging a joke to the point of audience fatigue, and throwing in an unnecessary acid trip sequence reminiscent of ""Family Guy's"" dreadful hurricane episode. The most memorable non-joke involved a shooting gallery depicting runaway slaves, which was not only offensive and unfunny, but historically wrong as slavery ended nearly twenty years before the movie's setting and Arizona wasn't even a state, much less part of the Confederacy.The story, such as it is, involves McFarlane (cause he IS playing himself) as a sheep farmer disgusted with the daily perils that come from a life in the Old West. His girlfriend immediately leaves him for a more exciting and wealthier mustache groomer played by Neil Patrick Harris, who McFarlane challenges to a gunfight to win her back despite the fact that he's never fired a gun in his life. Fortunately, he hits it off with a mysterious woman (Charlize Theron) who also teaches him how to shoot and becomes so enamored with her, he lets his nemesis have his girlfriend. Unfortunately for him, his new girlfriend has an outlaw husband who won't let him off the hook so easily. There's also a stagnant side plot about his best friend and his girlfriend saving themselves for marriage despite the fact that said girlfriend is a hooker by trade. You wouldn't think this sounds like much, yet the movie goes on for nearly two hours. When the far superior ""Gravity"" can tell its story in 90 minutes, you know there's a problem.And there is filler in this movie. The aforementioned hallucination sequence is not at all needed, nor is the bonding with the Indians scene leading up to it. Sadly, Liam Neeson is extraneous too. Though he gives a genuinely chilling performance, you could cut out his ENTIRE character and nothing would be lost. He has one scene at the beginning to establish how evil he is and he disappears until the last half-hour, which is where the most filler is. Honestly, the movie could've ended with McFarlane calling off the duel with NPH and taking Charlize to ride off into the sunset. The ""abstinent"" hooker and her boyfriend could've been cut because that plot just kinda goes nowhere. The beginning duel with a debt collector could've been cut too as it's used to set up a tasteless shadow puppet display and is later completely resolved offscreen. All that's probably a good forty-five minutes to be honest.There are some good performances and a few good jokes, believe it or not. The ending where Neeson drops dead before McFarlane can give his exposition was a pretty clever gag, the gag reference to ""Miss America 1880"" and the montage of McFarlane in target practice was pretty funny. Among the good performances are Neeson, Charlize Theron, and Harris, despite the fact that he has little to do and is given an overlong diarrhea joke and a dull musical number. And when McFarlane is on screen with Theron, he's pretty good too, because they do seem to be enjoying each other's company. Without her, however, he comes off as a bit of a deer in the headlights. The awkwardness of his opening scene gives a good indication of what you're in for. Another positive is that the cinematography is so gorgeous it could be on postcards.Much like modern day ""Family Guy,"" watching this film left me feeling empty and disappointed because it could've been so much better. If Seth McFarlane is going to transition into movies, he really needs (1) to not physically appear in front of the camera, (2) someone higher up to rein in his worst impulses, and to (3) write with someone other than one of his ""Family Guy"" cronies.Until then, there's always ""Ted,"" the first three seasons of ""Family Guy,"" and ""American Dad"" to occupy my time.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

That's from another movie (The Natural) and if only someone had had that talk with a young Seth McFarlane. It's clear he is a gifted voice actor, writer and animator. And yes he can sing and his acting is passable. He just shouldn't do all of these things at the same time! This is supposedly a tribute to Mel Brooks' 'Blazing Saddles' and, to be fair, Mel Brooks' comic sensibilities are an acquired taste as well. (For example 'Robin Hood: Men In Tights' is a horrible film too!) But 'Blazing Saddles' had the magical pairing of Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little to prop it up. In 'A Million Ways' you have Seth McFarlane and Charleze Theron (who should get an oscar for ""best supporting good sport""). It also stars Neil Patrick Harris, another boyishly charming actor who wants the world to know he can do it all and arguably Neil can (Gone Girl) but it's still annoying. McFarlane has the time, money and most importantly the need to continue producing this kind of stuff forever. Hopefully, he'll get better at it.

199,suicidea,How NOT to make a comedy 101,2,17 September 2018,"Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in The West should be taught in cinema schools, as a textbook example about how not to make a comedy. It has all the ingredients to make a funny film, but manages to do everything wrong, almost never hitting the right button.One, even if it's your baby (that's if you're the writer and director) it's still a mistake to cast yourself as the lead, unless you're right for the part. MacFarlane is not right for the part. He's the kind of guy who, even after watching him in 10 movies in a row, you still wouldn't recognize on the street. The part required a more memorable actor, and more importantly, someone who didn't look as if he was always about to burst into laughter, barely able to hold himself.Two, make up your mind about your target audience. The script has quite a few adult jokes, but they are dispersed between long scenes of unfunny, kid-oriented humour. A lot of recent American comedies have been suffering from this. They are like Disney family movies with an f-word or a phallic reference inserted every five minutes. Make up your mind: Are you making a film for kids? Then remove the language and innuendos. Are you making a film for adults? Then write stuff that will make adults laugh, not 10-year olds. (Like the fart jokes. I stopped counting after the fourth one).Three, when you're able to cast good actors, use them. The film has Charlize Theron, Neil Patrick Harris, Giovanni Ribisi (who has the only funny scene in the movie) but none of them have memorable roles, they're terribly underused. All the screen time is hogged by Seth MacFarlane's ever-stable facial expression, for a whopping 116 minutes.Four, never, ever repeat a joke, unless it's in a different context. And I'm not talking about the fart jokes every 10 minutes. I'm talking about the ""people never smiled in the old photos"" joke. It was funny the first time. Not funny the second time. Cringy the third time. And the fourth time, where MacFarlane inexplicably repeats the same joke with such sheer excitement, as if even he himself had never heard before, will make you think ""Is this guy serious?""Five, when you're analyzing past hit movies to give you inspiration, make the right deductions. Blazing Saddles wasn't funny because of the farts, it was funny because it had a solid plot, and the jokes linked to one another (as opposed to unrelated jokes / skits brought together to make a movie) and the characters were well-written.There are some redeeming points, though. The Neil Patrick Harris part with his shop is well written, and Sarah Silverman is obviously enjoying her sexual tirades, but they don't add up to be a funny movie.Overall, this is a huge disappointment, leaving you with no memorable scenes, faces, jokes, nothing. Considering the huge budget and nice cast, it surely could have been much more. But to make more, you first need to write it.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
200,shawthingproductions,Well - there go the actors' careers...,1,30 May 2014,"How this film ever got made is beyond me. I should have known it was going to be dire when it started with titles showing Seth Macfarlane as 'director', 'writer', 'actor', 'producer'. This is nothing more than a vanity project which proves he is past his sell-by-date and only really good for Family Guy (TED was a so-so comedy).The main problem with this film is the advertising campaign behind it - all trailers (and even teasers) show the funny bits and even when you're watching the film...These aren't even as funny as they appear to be in the trailer.The fact so many stars got involved with this (including cameos) also makes me wonder whether Seth has some kind of hold over them. Perhaps some dodgy photos from the Oscars after show party?This film has no redeeming qualities about it and sucked an hour and ten minutes from my life. It's considerably longer than this running time but - I have to be honest - I walked out (and was not the only one).Shame - was hoping for a fun comedy. Instead, I got served tripe.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
201,danielmartinx,"Well done, some awkward/lagging moments",8,31 May 2014,"I saw this movie last night and liked it. It's beautifully shot, and the panoramic ""wild west"" landscape and costumes and sets are beautifully western. The story arc was interesting, if a bit predictable, but the whole setting and story is really just a line on which MacFarlane hangs a bunch of jokes. He is a comedian with a ""here and now"" sensibility, and all of his works seem to be interesting/funny in the specific scene but perhaps a little poorly done in terms of the arc of the whole story.Charlize Theron was great. She turned in a solid and strong performance, as a tough-but-battered woman with a raunchy sense of humor and a very loving and protective heart. Others have noted that MacFarlane's performance doesn't quite hold up to hers, but there were moments when his uncanny big Irish mug and delivery were perfect.I was not expecting to find an innocent love story about people making the most of their lives and their situations. I was not expecting many of the things in the film, but enjoyed it all. 8 out of 10 because I'm knocking the film for its slender story arc. Another producer or some studio bigwigs could perhaps have retooled the script to make it more dramatic or rapid -- but then they might have killed off the good things in the script, too. All in all, I recommend.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

203,videodrome1234,Blazzing Ted.......,4,30 May 2014,"Seth Macfarlane's name is probably familiar because of Family Guy. I prefer animations like South Park and Simpsons but FG has its moment, that being said I was surprised by Macfarlene in 2012 when Ted came out. That film was about a talking teddy bear's and his best friend's dirty mouth and it was pure genius. The jokes weren't just funny they were original too, one's we've never heard before and that is very rear amongst comedies these days. So it really took me by surprise. Of course since the film made a lot of money, it was pretty much a given that there would be more made and Macfarlane would be give free reign. Other directors have been in this position before and it usually doesn't work out well. When I heard that before Ted 2 he will direct a western-comedy then I really started to worry. The reason for this is that this is a very tricky genre and apart from Blazing Saddles there hasn't really been any film that could make a huge splash and somehow Macfarlane's brand of humor doesn't seem to fit with the wild west, and unfortunately my fears were realized. Like I said before nothing noteworthy has been made in this genre, with the exception of Blazing Saddles, unfortunately the biggest problem with Macfarlane's film is that it looks like this is exactly the film he didn't watch, he has no idea what a wild-west comedy is like. If this film would have come out before Ted, Macfarlane would probably never be able to direct a film again, cause I'm sure that this will not be successful. As far as directing goes he does his job, but he falls short where he came out on top in Ted, with the story and the script. The scripts biggest mistake is that it's not funny enough, when it is funny the joke doesn't belong in the wild-west setting. Most of the time I felt that I'm watching recycled jokes, cock and fart jokes, but that isn't even the problem, the problem is that the story is totally typical. Nothing extra. and it wanted too much. The film is full of great actors but the film has no idea what to do with the characters. A lot of them get lost in the background and we barely get to know them. Macfarlane to me wasn't convincing enough it's like the people in the wild-west who meet Marty in Back to the Furture 3. They all laugh at him because he doesn't belong. Charlize Theron, Giovanni Ribisi are okay as are NPH and his mustache. To me the biggest disappointment was Liam Neeson, you can tell he isn't enjoying the role, the whole thing just doesn't fit. All of this is also shadowed with the major problem that the trailer gives away all the jokes, and except for the whisky stealing joke, none of them are funny. So all in all Macfarlane did what I wasn't expecting, taking a mediocre comedy and transplanting it to the old west. Unfortunately its filled with mistakes and not too original. 4/10 just for the cameos, they are great keep an eye out. Other than that I only recommend it to Macfarlane fans. https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1",A Million Ways to Die in the West
204,dirtphelia,Relies on immature and plain stupid bodily function jokes,4,17 September 2017,"Just not that good, though it follows the trend of big name actors starring in bad movies - how and why I do not know, but here we have Liam Neeson (THE Liam Neeson) and Charlize Theron. They're always great to watch but I can't understand why they agreed to be part of such silly antics. Even if seeing that Sarah Silverman was in this lowered my expectations, I was still surprised at how bad it was.(Spoiler alert) I mean, Liam Neeson falls to the ground and Theron sticks a flower in his butt crack. Really? Then Neil Patrick Harris relieves his bouts of diarrhea in a couple guys' hats, which is disgusting and immature - but wait, there's more! We actually get to see what came out of him. For that alone this movie loses a couple of stars.Come on, people, how low can a movie go? I don't know what's up with Hollywood but it doesn't fail to disappoint.

205,BrentHankins,"A few genuine laughs, if you can wade through all the toilet humor.",6,29 May 2014,"After finding tremendous success with animated sitcoms Family Guy and American Dad, Seth MacFarlane ventured into the realm of live-action comedy with 2012's smash hit Ted, which featured Mark Wahlberg as a slacker whose best friend is a sex-and-drugs-obsessed teddy bear. While MacFarlane provided the voice and motion capture for the titular stuffed animal, he never actually appeared in the film, but takes center stage in his sophomore effort, A Million Ways to Die in the West.Set in Arizona in 1882, the film stars MacFarlane as Albert Stark, a mild-mannered sheep farmer living a mundane existence in the rough and tumble town of Old Stump. Stark has just lost his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) to a wealthy local businessman (Neil Patrick Harris), and spends his days drinking away his sorrows with his best (and seemingly only) friend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and his prostitute fiancée, Ruth (Sarah Silverman).Meanwhile, notorious outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) has dispatched his wife to Old Stump to await his arrival while he and the rest of the gang pull off another stagecoach robbery. After a chance encounter during a bar fight, Anna (Charlize Theron) takes an immediate liking to Stark, and agrees to help him win back the heart of his lost love, but omitting her true identity could have grave consequences when Clinch discovers who she's spending her days with.While the plot sounds like it could have come from any number of Western films, everything that occurs on screen is through the filter of MacFarlane's unique sense of humor. Simultaneously poking fun at genre tropes while also paying homage to the classics, A Million Ways to Die in the West offers plenty to laugh at, including a hilarious song and dance number about men's facial hair, and an absurd variety of comedic death sequences.Unfortunately, these moments are overshadowed by the fact that most of the film's humor is derived from the sort of R-rated content that MacFarlane can't get away with on television. There are only so many jokes about semen, diarrhea, and homosexuality that an audience can absorb before these topics stops being funny, but the film continues well past that mark, with Silverman coming across as particularly grating. After years of the exact same schtick, haven't people grown tired of hearing her talk about her vagina? MacFarlane has proved time and again that he can write intelligent, thought-provoking comedy, but much like his previous film, he seems far too willing to cast that aside in favor of dick jokes and lame attempts to be offensive and shocking, just for the sake of being offensive and shocking. A Million Ways to Die in the West isn't a bad film - indeed, I think it's a vast improvement over Ted - but it's still not the MacFarlane film that I had hoped for. He's better than this, and hopefully we'll see that in his next flick.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Do you like Family Guy yes/no?
If yes you may like this film. (Possibly)
If no you probably won't. (Probably).
If you have never seen Family Guy but have a knowledgeable but slightly twisted but are not offended by humour some consider bad taste in many ways but can see through it because you are intelligent enough to see through it and know the humour is intended to offend those who carry those views and are really the offenders of distateful and offensive or much worse views. Then you may or may not like this film.The film itself I found incredibly amusing, well directed, great at times cinematography, and brilliantly acted by talent who got the humour in the first place.
But humour like this on a film length needs a good story to put it together. Is it very original or predictable? Not really. But the pace of the story is excellent and the strength of the humour is so strong, if you like it, will actually be disappointed when it ends it so amusing.Seth MacFarlane has proved himself as a director in Family Guy, of course a very different media to a feature length film, and proved himself as a director of film with Ted. Of course he acted in that too, if unseen in a way.In this he actually as well as directing and co-writting, acts and takes the lead role. His comic timing is spot on. But his acting also holds the film together. He has done serious roles since and gave a double slap in the face to viewers who think he is not a good actor.That all aside I watched this film many years ago and found it massive fun from the first scene. If you don't like the first scene it is not for you.I love film. Of every genre. If the film is quality. My favourite film is Subway by Luc Besson. But I don't concentrate on one genre. I delve in to all. Sometimes you find just plain bad film. This I did not. It was a joy first time. Probably better second time. Picked up a few jokes and Easter Eggs I missed first time. I only watch a limited number of films more than once. This? In a year or two I will likely watch it again.Know what you are going to watch before you watch it.And I hope you laugh as much as I did and will. A full 10/10. If only i could turn it up to eleven as I would rate it that highly.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
208,tmf084,I think it's was hilarious ....,9,3 September 2014,"If you know MacFarlane and his style then you pretty much know what kind of comedy you can expect. It's set in the western frontier of the late 19th century and besides slapstick, jokes and some comedic-gore (see movie title) you also have subtle satire about the era back then, which, from time to time, achieves to mock the backward thinking of a few people from the present. The only thing which is slightly different is that there are fewer politically incorrect jokes. Also MacFarlane's performance is solid, he fits like a glove for the role as sheep farming nerd and coward, who doesn't belong in that place and time. His chemistry with Theron is good and I was surprised how well she would do in such a goofy production. Her more serious part acts as a nice counter balance to keep the whole thing grounded, but it never takes itself too seriously. Also Neeson's outlaw with Irish accent is a pretty cool antagonist and way better than some of the bad guys I know from other comedies. The only things I would criticize are the rather predictable plot and the pacing towards the end, which is a bit too slow. However, I think this movie is hilarious, it's definitely not meant to be liked by everybody especially if you don't like MacFarlane, but it was fun and very entertaining.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

It is in no way a ""follow-up of Ted"" although they do both parody existing movie genres and have the odd celebrity appearance.I thought this movie was good and you should watch it if you have the patience for a western styled parody and crude/silly humour.However, as Seth McFarlen's almost sole creation, you will also notice how having others check your work can really help clean it up; as much of the comedy falls dead.

It's not great but it's watchable. 6/10",A Million Ways to Die in the West
216,oscarxp25,An okay follow up to Ted,6,1 June 2014,"Seth MacFarlene is unapologetic about his brand of humor. Where Judd Apatow tries to hide his filth through witty dialogue, MacFarlene is in your face with his childish but often very funny humor. He knows deep down inside all of us, behind the maturity of being an adult, lies the ten year old snickering at fart, dick, and sex jokes. In his first feature film,""Ted"", he had that humor channeled through a talking teddy bear. Here, he takes a the live action approach with parodying old school Western films.MacFarlene, in the lead role, plays Albert, who is a wimp that is terrible at his job at being a farmer. His stock is sheep. The humor derived from his occupation of choice is smirk worthy at first, but quickly wears thin as the film moves along. The love of his life, who doesn't share the same feelings back, Louise, played by Amanda Seyfried, dumps him with in minutes of the film opening. The only friend MacFarlene has is a lovable loser like him. Edward, played by Giovanni Ribisi, is in love and about to get married to Ruth. Ruth, who is played by perfectly played by Sarah Silverman, is a prostitute that, on average, sleeps with fifteen guys a day. Edward doesn't mind it because he finds her job and life exciting, compared to his mundane one. The relationship is sweet and laughable. Silverman gives Ruth that dirty side that so many actresses would fail to put forward in a role like this. Ribisi, who played a creep in 2012's ""Ted"", once again embraces his creep side to play Edward. This time though he is a less scary creep and more of a lovable one. Albert's life is then given a kick when a beautiful outlaw named Anna comes to town. Charlize Theron, who seems to be having a great time, is a nice fit into the universe that MacFarlene has created. Her and MacFarlene have great on screen chemistry. On top of his immature comedy style, MacFarlene has an obvious fondness for musicals. Anyone who has watched ""Family Guy"" sees knows that he can put together a good tune. He is a showman. The film, which is a very good parody of the west, is very light on its feet even when things do get dark or serious. Liam Neeson, who plays Anna's criminal out-law husband, Clinch, never really cracks a joke, but is the butt of many. While the film is a parody, it is very convincing recreation of the west. MacFarlene has created a living and breathing representation of what many would feel what it would be like to live in. While other films, especially comedies, romanticize the view of the wild west, his interpretation, while played for comedy, seems dangerous and wild. In one great bit, Albert rattles off everything that could kill you. One of the things we are informed about is doctors don't know what the hell they are doing and have silly and twisted methods on how to cure a simple cut or sickness. MacFarlene shows that when he isn't catering to the idiotic masses, he actually has a sharp eye for observational humor.While those things do work, there are things that bog down the film. MacFarlene's immature side does get the best of him for the greater part of the film. His trademark fart and dick jokes contribute to many of the misfires in the comedy department. He also has a habit over going on too long with a gag or practically spoon feeding the audience punchlines. There are so many things to parody in this genre and he tries to fit everything into this picture. The film drags out too long and could have cut about twenty minutes out of useless material. A drug trip comes off as forced and too weird. Even though there is a great joke at Seyfried's expense in there. His need to cover every aspect of the genre does become a bit over abundant at times.The one thing he did get right was the cast. While Neeson does cover the enemy role quite well, everyone else is ace with the comedy. Theron never stumbles with the comedy at all. Theron really does these kind of films but she definitely has a knack for them. Ribisi and Silverman are a great duo together. She uses his vulgar card full out in this film. It fits nicely with the character. Neil Patrick Harris is basically playing Barney here with a mustache. MacFarlene is okay as an actor; though he is no where near as strong as the costars he has surrounded himself. ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is a cartoon come to life. Seth could have easily animated this film instead of doing live action. It embraces how ridiculous it is and does not pretend to be something smart or witty. You have to admire the truth in that decision. He is just there is have fun. The cartoon feel though does backfire at points because what works in one medium may not work in another.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
217,mfrost71w,Surprisingly bad film,3,7 July 2017,"Mmm...now here's a curious thing - a comedy that isn't funny, an 1882 western set in the modern day, a star who's a cartoonist rather than an actor. The childish toilet humour will appeal only to 11 year old's and the retarded; the anachronisms from imposing modern day speech, idioms, values and culture on an 1882 setting are annoying in the extreme; love Family guy but Seth is not an actor as is abundantly made clear by this film. In short, a real turkey",A Million Ways to Die in the West
218,HollywoodJunket,Death and Celebs in The West - Not A Winning Combo!,7,2 June 2014,"Written by: Myles Warden for Hollywood Junket Disease. Gun Fight. Snake Bite. Bar Fight. These are just some of the ways Seth MacFarlene uses to execute in his newest film A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST.A Million Ways To Die In The West is a comedy that is directed by, written by, and stars Seth MacFarlene. Or, as every advertisement would like to remind us ""THE GUY WHO BROUGHT US TED!"" He also gets some help from his ""Ted"" writing partners Alec Sulkin and Wellessley Wild and some very famous costars, as some equally famous cameos by Ewan McGregor, Gilbert Gottfried, Christopher Lloyd, Dennis Haskins.Besides the subplot of all the ways to die in the west the movie is about Seth's character Albert, a terrible and courage-less sheep farmer, who loses his girlfriend Louise, played by Amanda Seyfried, by withdrawing from a gun fight and attempts to get her back by making her jealous with his new to town friend Anna (Charlize Theron). Of course he falls in love with this new girl and eventually discovers she's married to the baddest man in the west which leads to trouble.One thing's for sure Seth knows how to pull in the A-list talent and if you've ever seen Family Guy or Ted you know he loves a good random cameo as well. This movie is no exception with Liam Neeson playing Anna's husband Clinch (the best shooter in the west), Giovanni Ribisi as Albert's virgin best friend Edward, Sarah Silverman as Albert's prostitute girlfriend Ruth, Neil Patrick Harris as Louise's new rich beau Foy, and a slew of surprise cameos. It's definitely an embarrassment of riches of talent for any director so the question is does Seth make the most of his riches or does he die trying? The answer is - kind of. Allow me to explain. There were a ton of extremely hilarious moments such as the musical number with Neil Patrick Harris' character Foy, numerous interactions between Ruth and Edward, and of course each surprise cameo packed a great punch, Christopher Lloyds' Emmett ""Doc"" Brown from ""Back to the Future"" movies included. On the other hand there were a ton of scenes that lasted too long or entire acts, which is the case with the final act of the movie. There were also a few deaths that just had zero funny in them.You can't really drag out the ending to a movie when everyone knows how it will play out and we're just kind of waiting to get there and hoping for laughs along the way. Every scene did serve a purpose but if that purpose doesn't also make you laugh in a comedy then it's null and void. With that said there were simply too many scenes where that was the case.There were some magical moments where everything clicked. One of the best examples is the annual county fair. Here we get a few hilarious and random deaths and our first interaction between Albert, his ex Louise, his new friend Anna, and Louise's new boyfriend Foy. This scene shows everyone's personality perfectly and also sets up the path for the rest of the film. We also get to hear Neal Patrick Harris say ""challenge accepted"" and get a very funny cameo from a 90's TV principal.I will also say the cast did a splendid job and were perfect for the roles they were cast in. Seth even managed to pull off some emotional moments very well. Too bad the acting just couldn't make this as great as TED (assuming you loved TED like I did) and it falls short too often. Not a complete loss but not a movie you'll want to watch twice.MORE at: HollywoodJunket.com",A Million Ways to Die in the West

225,lornloxor,Not as funny as Ted but still quite entertaining if you're part of MacFarlane's audience,6,1 June 2014,"A Million Ways To Die in the West is more vulgar and crude than MacFarlane's feature debut Ted (think sheep penises and quite a bit of poop jokes). Yeah, he may have gone too far in a few places. I loved Ted, it was consistently funny and it had a real heart to it. I remember cracking up really hard when I saw it in the theaters. I had a decently good time with A Million Ways To Die in the West as well but I wasn't laughing uncontrollably at all and some of the jokes fell a tad flat and some of them could've been edited to be shorter. They were mostly amusing at least though so it's not that they didn't work at all. I just wish MacFarlane had aimed a bit higher and built more onto some of the stuff that was in the film (like the running gag with Sarah Silverman's prostitute and her hapless boyfriend in Giovanni Ribisi, it was the same joke all the way through).I'm not quite sure what to think of Seth MacFarlane as an actor. He's terrific as an voice actor but he doesn't quite have that cinematic look for live acting in my opinion and he looks out of place in front of a camera. That actually sort of works to his advantage here because the whole thing has this off-kilter feel to it. Also, being the voice to a raunchy teddy bear or a baby makes stuff funnier just by itself and let's you get away with more stuff so I hope he sticks to his voice acting in the future. Charlize Theron looked gorgeous in the film and she had pretty good comedic timing as well. I sort of have this hunch that all of this was just an elaborate plot by MacFarlane to get some action going with Theron. Can't fault the guy for that I guess. Liam Neeson works well as this hard ass counterpart in comedies (watch his sketch with Ricky Gervais in Life's Too Short if you're not convinced) but I do wish that he had more screen time and depth here though. There are also a few funny cameos in the film so that's something to look for. All in all, I liked A Million Ways To Die in the West but I was expecting more from MacFarlane. If you liked Ted and Family Guy, go see the film but with tempered expectations. I'm still expecting good things from Ted 2 as it will play more to MacFarlane's strengths as a comedian.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

227,db-beurylaw,Finally a film that tells How the West Really Was,9,2 July 2014,"Hollywood loves the Western. The first real movie, ""The Great Train Robbery"" was a western. Over the past 110 years the studios have made about 50 westerns a year or about 6,000 westerns. Most were romanticized baloney showing how glorified and exciting it was to be in the small dirty towns that dot the west. Finally someone makes a movie that points out that it is all bullshit. The West in the second half of the 19th century was dirty and dangerous. Herding cattle (or sheep) is incredibly boring. There were very few women and those that were were reduced to being prostitutes. Then you have a bunch of uneducated idiots who tote a gun everywhere and you have, well a modern Republican paradise, but hell for the rest of us. Seth McFarlane's movie make a great comedic point of all of this and the film works best when it shows the west as it was. I grew up in Nevada and once you get away from Vegas and get to the small towns you can see how boring and brutal life was and some places still is. OK, I could have done without the fart jokes and the scene were a sheep pees in Seth's face. McFarlane should have stuck more to his theme about reality of the west. The other unbelievable part is Charlize Theron. It would be hard to believe that you would encounter two beautiful women in one small town. Even more was that she was so street smart and valuable to Seth. But she was awesome and moved the story along. Sara Silverman was more realistic as a hooker who had to service the whole town. Yes, Seth McFarlane is a poor actor, but so was Bob Hope, Steve Martin, Jerry Lewis and a whole bunch of comedians who brought laughs to the screen. One thing that needs to be said: The IMDb has to police this site better. This movie was released at about the same time as ""Blended"", a horrible piece of garbage. There were numerous public reviews posted on the Blended site that were clearly fraudulent. Apparently publicists for Adam Sandler/ Happy Madison Productions wrote fake reviews because there is no way that crap could rate a 10 out of ten. I don't believe that anyone is that stupid to rate a poor movie like Blended that highly. Conversely I believe that the same people gave this movie an extremely low grade. I strongly suspect that many of the review were inflated for Blended and deflated for this film because they were both in the theaters at the same time and both competing for movie goers ten bucks. This move is not a 10, but there is no way a reasonable comedy lover would give it a ""1"". I take a ""10"" grade seriously, only great movies deserve a ""10"". Good movies deserve an 8. Adam Sandler deserves the Razzies he always wins.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
228,xodanielcasterox,"Pretty funny, but weak story.",6,5 October 2014,"I heard the reviews for this and I can understand why people don't find it very funny, but I thought it was funny. It's not ""TED"" but it still had it's funny moments and some dumb moments. I just prefer Seth as a voice actor rather than a physical actor. There's a couple of jokes that did work I could point out but I won't spoil it for you; you decide if they're funny or not . Charlize Theron, if I'm spelling her name wrong I'm sorry, is okay; she's pretty much just a sexy face. I like Liam Neeson as the bad guy (though he should work better on his American accent like he used to or maybe his character is Irish,) but there was nothing special or new going on; it's just Liam Neeson as the bad guy. The story is pretty weak. The title says ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" even though there's no real focus on it; it's more of a sheep farmer evolving into a hero as he falls in love with a hot chick who turns out to be the wife of our villain. That's the plot. That's not new. It's not really funny, it's just pretty funny. That's it. If you're looking for a stupid dumb little comedy and you have a thing for poop jokes then this movie is right for you.

Although it is worth acknowledging that the premise itself is innovative, offering a very original approach, the film comes across as an unsuccessful genre parody, one that has a very limited impact on the viewer. There are some clever moments during the course of the film that showcase Macfarlane's trademark humor, but those are few and far between, and one would expect a slightly more sophisticated approach from the director. Along with being considerably too long for a film of its nature, A Million Ways to Die in the West desperately tries to amuse the audience at all times, but fails miserably, mainly due to the lack of subtlety in its humor, which ultimately results in an ineffective and boring comedy.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

It wasn't a bad movie. But it wasn't nearly as funny as the stuff I'm used to by him. It was also way to long for what it is.

Its dragged out, amateurish and childlike toilet humor is about as funny as a boil. The fact that ANYBODY finds this kind of garbage humorous, in any capacity, just says that they must be under 23 and think they're supposed to find this hilarious. What it says to me, and probably 10,000 other movie goers, is that if this is all the material they can come up with for a script - which by the way has ZERO plot in it, as well - then I'd save my ticket money and just get disappointed on-line when the movie comes out for web-streaming.

239,Rage-Kage,Pretty good overall,8,12 June 2014,I've been pretty excited about this movie ever since I first saw the trailer a few months ago. I was sure that it would be the funniest movie of the year and I was a little disappointed. Thats not t say that this movie wasn't funny it just wasn't hilarious like I'd hoped. Even though A Million Ways to Die in the West was not the funniest movie I've ever seen it was still a good movie. On top of being funny the story was entertaining and very well done. Seth MacFarlane is a sheep farmer who gets dumped by his girlfriend and then spends most of the movie trying to get her back. It's entertaining watching him go from kind of a coward to less of a coward. I know that makes it sound like he did not change at all throughout the movie but he does and it's fun to watch. Seth MacFarlane and Charlize Theron worked well together and had a believable relationship and Sarah Silverman and Giovanni Ribisi were also very good together. In particular every scene Sarah Silverman was in were all really funny.After the movie my friend said to me that he didn't like the ending because he was expecting a much more epic final shoot out between Seth MacFarlane and Liam Neeson and I get where he is coming from but have to disagree. I thought that the way it ended fit the overall tone of the rest off the movie. I really don't get why this movie is getting all of the hate that it's getting. If I had to guess I would think it is probably because like me people expected it to be funnier than it ended up being and since it is supposed to be a comedy a lot of people probably automatically decided it was a bad movie. I can't say that I blame anyone for thinking that but if you are thinking about seeing this movie I'd say don't worry about all the bad or mixed reviews and just go see it for yourself. If you like Seth MacFarlane type humor you will probably like this movie.I give A Million Ways to Die in the West an 8/10,A Million Ways to Die in the West

Their sons led with their dicks and their guns. If one was at the wrong end of a revolver, instead of giving up, he would start talking trash about the guy's sister's knowledge of all the young men in the county. And get killed.Louis L'Amour said that a gunman itching for a duel was more likely to get shot off his horse by all the weapons-trained Civil War vets who populated the territories. Gunslingers were likely to apologize to a challenger and buy him a beer knowing that he probably could kill most men. God? McCoy cursed Hatfield wishing God would send him to Hell. Hatfield said, ""If I hear anymore about God-whose side He's on-you won't be riding out of here on the horse your sitting on."" Most morals were anomic: without norms, moral landmarks or direction.

242,AlukardsCastle,Mostly forgettable,5,29 May 2014,"After the hugely successful and hilarious Ted and Family Guy/American Dad have engraved themselves into history, it seems like Seth Macfarlene could do no wrong. Wrong. If this movie was his 'F*** you' to critics and expectations, then F*** you Seth Macfarlene. This movie sucked. The humor sucked most of the time. The idea of a western comedy was always a bad one and this movie proves it didn't work. Also, Seth isn't a believable leading man, well at least not for this setting. I will say that some of the jokes made me chuckle, but most of them were just annoying. Even the somewhat funny jokes were forgettable. They would make you laugh, but after the movie is done you won't remember a single joke. There won't be anything to quote in a tweet or FB status. Nothing memorable to laugh about later when discussing the movies with friends the way Family Guys episodes would make you do. You'll laugh, but you'll forget what made you laugh. Not good. I'm someone who has an immature sense of humor and high comedy sense of humor at the same time. I would classify most of the jokes and gags in this movie to be just annoying. Not funny, annoying. The best thing about the movie has to be the cameos and references to irrelevant topics in the same fashion as Family Guy, but not nearly as good. Some of the shots of the setting are nice and again, the cameos are fun to watch. But that's it. This movie will bomb at the box office and it deserves to. If you are reading this review during the movies opening weekend, I suggest you choose the better Maleficent instead. At least you'll have a visual feast with that movie compared to a B-movie with forgettable humor like this movie. It will have a decent opening weekend but afterwards it will die out. If you are reading this review in the future, then you'll see I'm right, right? Only worth a rental tops. Hopefully next time Seth tries a live action film starring himself he'll choose a better setting and time and provide better writing and funnier jokes and gags. If not, then someone tell this guy to just make a feature length Family Guy animated movie to release to theaters like The Simpsons did.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
243,bkbirge,"Fun movie, great production values, brought down by reliance on fart jokes",7,5 September 2014,"I did like this movie quite a bit, there are some genius moments in it.I think it can be summed up by the scene where the Love Interest is encouraging the Main Guy to believe in himself. I think if McFarlane had believed in more of his non-toilet humor moments instead of using the farting and cussing as a crutch it would have been a lot funnier. Don't get me wrong, I've got a pretty high tolerance for both but even I could tell he was leaning on them way too heavily.I expect he'll get there eventually though, I would watch another movie of his because overall the fun parts for me outweigh the negatives. But after the 10th fart joke they did start getting real old.The casting was inspired and as has been mentioned he and Theron have great chemistry. All the curtain chewing side characters were great, especially Ribisi's. Greatest cameos in a long time too.I think McFarlane could be this generation's Mel Brooks if he wanted to be, seems a natural at that kind of humor, same level of silliness, slapstick and sarcastic and self referential observations. But Mel didn't wallow as much in the butthole side of things.I also don't agree with the criticism of McFarlane as a lead actor. I think he has it, just needs more cracks at it. He's got the looks and style for that classic Buster Keaton every-man archetype. It would have served the story better if there was a little less of his character and more of the others, and in that regards it comes of kind of as a vanity project. But overall enjoyable even after cringing at the umpteenth bodily function set piece.I get the impression that everyone in the movie had a lot of fun working on it and the production values are high, especially the music as is always the case with a McFarlane production.I know he can do better than this but the question is if he wants to. I guess we'll see in the future.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

If you are looking for The Unforgiven, Tombstone, The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, True Grit, or any other Western fanfare with quality plots and superior acting, this is not it.What this movie is, however, is a parody of the Western lifestyle delivered in buckets of laughs with crude humor and offensive jokes.

It is produced by Seth McFarlane, who obviously is unable to select a capable crew. 2. It is written by Seth McFarlane, who obviously is very infantile and not funny at all. 3. It is directed by Seth McFarlane, who has no talent for directing and editing. 4. The lead character is played by Seth McFarlane, whose acting skills are absolutely undetectable. Lucky for him, judging from his ultra-smug appearances on various talk shows, his ego does not seem affected by the above facts.I must have seen at least a couple of dozen really awful movies through the years, but none as bad as this one.

The jokes are crude and unfunny. The characters are unlikable especially the main character who just goes around pointing out everything wrong with society at the time only stopping when there's an awful joke to make. This movie has an theme of death that just goes nowhere and is entirely pointless. The fact is this movie is like many others excepted with a western and death theme. This movie is just as bad if not worst than Ted. Seth McFarland should stick to TV instead of putting out awful movies like this.

With this film I was expecting another 'Blazing Saddles' but it was not quite up to that level. I found some of the gags just a bit too crude for my liking but Charlize Theron and Liam kept it watchable with sterling performances.

How in the world Amanda Seyfried goes from Les Miserables to this is beyond me.She had to have lost a bet to take such a step backwards in her career, unless the money was too good to pass for her or everyone else. So embarrassing I rather just stop talking about it.

253,ghostjunk,The Wild West Will Never Be The Same...,8,27 May 2015,"Writer/director Seth MacFarlane stars in this western tale of a cowardly sheep farmer who struggles to win back the love of his ex-girlfriend. Due to unexpected circumstances, his plans quickly change once he falls in love with the mysterious new woman in town, who turns out to be the runaway wife of a vicious gun-slinging outlaw. Forced to deal with this new dangerous turn of events, our protagonist must look deep within himself to find the courage he never had to be the hero he never was.In this contemporary take on the classic western genre, Seth MacFarlane manages to cleverly satirize the old west by poking fun at all the harsh realities of this time period. A Million Ways to Die in the West may have been a little too smart for its own good, though. Considering its poor critical reception, I think a lot of people failed to understand or appreciate the true brilliance this movie conveys through its humor. Or maybe they just couldn't see past the farts? Despite his use of toilet humor, none of Seth's jokes ever feel forced or out of place, which is why more of the gags are hits rather than misses. This is primarily due to his clearly educated writing talents, ensuring that his jokes are never one-dimensional and that the line between the serious tones and silly slapstick remain balanced throughout. This can't be said without mentioning his ingenious use of the most priceless cameos possible. I won't spoil them for you, but let's just say I'm very confident true movie buffs will appreciate their flair and surely crack a smile! While some of the scenes are pretty gruesome, his realistic approach to violence helps convey a brutal honesty towards its true nature. This was a smart touch as it clearly helps elevate the sense of danger while ensuring we understand its grim reality rather than simply glorifying it. This approach is also elevated from his use of practical effects and highly detailed set pieces that accurately recreate the look and feel of the dangerous and depressing old wild west.Final consensus: in the vein of his hit TV series Family Guy, Seth MacFarlane fires non-stop jokes that are playfully delivered with strong wit and near-perfect comedic timing. Self-aware of its own edgy stupidity, A Million Ways to Die in the West is a brilliant homage to its time period and a hilarious slapstick blast!",A Million Ways to Die in the West
254,JoshuaHarryMurphy,Sporadically Funny,6,23 June 2014,"'A Million Ways to Die in the West' is a western-comedy film helmed by Seth MacFarlane (directing, producing, writing and starring.) The film features an accomplished ensemble cast including Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried, Neil Patrick Harris, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, and Liam Neeson The film is MacFarlane's second attempt at directing a live- action film, following the release of Ted in 2012. The film focuses on the cowardly sheep farmer Albert Stark (MacFarlane) who attempts to survive in the extraordinarily treacherous 1880s Wild West, whilst trying to win back the affection of his estranged girlfriend (Seyfried). The film is intermittently funny – more often than not during sequences void of Albert's presence. Unlike Mark Walberg in Ted, MacFarlane's performance appears tiresome, and his sporadic instances of genuine humour are few and far between. This regrettably means that he generally struggles to maintain interest and generate empathy. Counteracting this though are strong performances from the rest of the billing, but from Theron in particular, who breathes life and energy into every sequence she's in. The film's narrative in itself is so simplistic and predictable that these performances are really the fundamental factor which contributes to the majority of the enjoyment of the film. The film's pacing comes off as nonchalant and mis-judged, as the film jumps from sequences of intense gross-out humour, to unnecessarily lengthy expositional sequences which essentially act as a narrative bridge to allow MacFarlane to attempt to create some substance behind the amalgamation of toilet humour. Despite MacFarlane's evident knowledge of the western genre and its conventions, it appears that he struggled to pinpoint the exact purpose of this film. It seems as if 'A Million Way to Die in the West' is the mutual ground between the two films MacFarlane wanted to make: a simplistic and traditional heartfelt drama set in the west, and an over the top gross out slapstick-filled comedy with cowboys. Ultimately this indecision leaves the film feeling almost purposeless, with many minutes spent just waiting for the next inevitable punchline.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

This one is well worth your time, it will definitely give you a good laugh, a couple of chuckles and a few grins that might come back on you later. I guarantee it is not your Grandmother's cup of tea, and I strongly suggest no young kids watch this.

Characters would pop up and I would think ""Oh My god That's ___"", and "" I love~ him/her."" Its jam packed with great movie stars.The story is simple but NOT simplistic. There is lots of action going on in sub plots etc. Performances by the actors were VERY good and I am sure allot of them had serious problems keeping a straight face while filming. I can only imagine how much fun they had making this come together, and I sure wish I could have been at the cast party.It was extremely entertaining.

But the chemistry between Seth & Charlize is so genuine, it felt more like an actual love story.There were both laugh out loud moments, as well as some uncomfortable ones. The entire first half of the movie I was adjusting to hearing Brian Griffin's voice come out of an actual human being. I didn't know that was his real voice, it was weird.Giovanni Ribisi & Liam Neeson played their parts to perfection. There were also many surprise cameos throughout the film that were pretty random & hysterical. I thought the funniest parts came at the end, which also plays to the movie's favor. Overall I liked Seth very much as an actor, very compelling. I hope some of the negative reviews don't dissuade him from keeping on with it",A Million Ways to Die in the West
260,andyreynolds-1,Expected More,5,4 June 2014,"If Seth McFarlane created this film just for the opportunity to snog Charlize Theron then well played sir, well played. Unfortunately one mans opportunity to kiss a beautiful movie star is another mans two hours of average entertainment.As a longtime fan of Family Guy I went into the cinema armed with popcorn, M&M's and a drink with pretty high expectations. The popcorn was salty, the M&M's were sweet and my drink wasn't flat but sadly I can't say the same for A Millions Ways to Die in the West. It began poorly and only just rose above that standard on a couple of occasions until the final credits.To be fair, the storyline wasn't too bad but Seth and his writers spent a quarter of the film introducing the main protagonists before getting on with the narrative. Charlize Therons character introduction was almost an after thought and her friendship with Seth went from introduction to firm friends in 5 minutes. The writing comes across as convenient, lazy and disjointed.As an actor McFarlane tries hard and is at his best when his emotions are extreme. Anger or depression are his best moments but in between he appears unsure of himself. Theron and Neeson are clearly having fun in their roles with the Northern Irishman thoroughly enjoying himself as the villain of the piece. Sarah Silver is excellent as always but Giovanni Ribisi could not have appeared more disinterested as her fiancé. He all but checked his watch in every scene and appeared to want to be anywhere else but in this film. The same could be said of Amanda Seyfried and Neil Patrick Harris who practically phoned in their performances.I'm not saying the movie was unfunny because there were a couple of laugh out loud moments but over two hours they were few and far between. Perhaps the film could have been reduced to 30 minutes....and produced as a cartoon.......and Seth could have still kissed Charlize if he wanted.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Beautiful scenes in Monument Valley, AZ.Loved the cameos too! Of course it was absurd (so was Ted for that matter but it was funny too).

264,brendan-821-654855,A million ways to ruin a film,1,16 June 2014,"The problem with this film is that it didn't actually appear to understand what it wanted to be.In places it is romantic comedy, in others it is action drama, in others it is part Adam Sandler comedy, but mostly it's just a collection of crude and unfunny frat boy jokes.I am amazed the movie failed the way it did, because it has a lot of star power, and a decent budget behind it - but then I guess it just goes to show that just because you can succeed in one medium, that doesn't always mean you are automatically capable of doing the same in every medium.Probably one of the biggest flaws in this film is that not only does the main character's frame of reference make absolutely no sense, but it's also inconsistent throughout the film.MacFarlane plays a character who spends the entire movie showing how enlightened he is by complaining about how terrible life in the West is - but he could only know this if he had experienced life AFTER that period, and therefore had something to compare it with. For someone living in that actual period, things would have actually seemed quite advanced, compared to what had gone before, and with all the technological developments and political innovations taking place during that actual period.And then later in the film, MacFarlene's supposedly enlightened and modern-thinking character suddenly reverts back to making jokes about the American Indian people (something someone of his period is likely to do), but then later still he actually gets adopted by an Indian tribe because of his enlightened approach to Indian/American relations.I would also suggest that his jokes about ""Black men"" and their body preferences in women, and the Islamic ""death chant"" were grossly demeaning, if not racist.And don't get me started on the montage towards the end of the film, which largely felt like a series of skits that didn't fit anywhere else in the movie, so they jammed them pointlessly into the montage because they didn't have the good sense to know they weren't actually that funny.All in all it was a confused effort that just wasn't that good.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

In the end, I was pleasantly surprised. So much funnier than I thought it would be. I think because the jokes were dry and in some cases dark. Not far removed from risque British comedy.

Sure, there's the recycling gag thingy people complain about, there's potty humor and swears. But this is the thing; it's not intended to be a classy, heartfelt comedy. It's just a very funny and immature slapstick comedy. It's clear that Seth McFarlanes humor isn't classy, clever or original. However, he does manage to create a somewhat funny movie that can be enjoyed. Now, I like stupid, silly movies. I don't like cleverly written comedies. So, If you are a fan of Family Guy or Ted's humor, you will probably like this movie.A lot of reviewers tend to review this movie as like it is trying to be an Oscar movie. It isn't. All the actors did a great job (even the small rolls), the jokes weren't all over the place & it was actually quite enjoyable. They're having fun, we're having fun. Nothing wrong with that.I don't understand why people go into movies like these expecting them to be some kind of comical masterpiece when the trailer was clear enough about it just being another random & dumb slapstick comedy. People are stupid enough to go watch it knowing what type of movie this is and expecting it to be something it's not.So bottom line: If you like stupid & silly comedies with racist jokes & stereotypes, go watch this one. If you are a typical fan of the humor in Family Guy, South Park etc you will enjoy. There's plenty of different kinds of jokes in here. None of them classy, but funny. Toilet humor, foul mouths, racist stereotypes, offensive parodies & a few references that will be totally unexpected. If you're a fan of cleverly written scripts & wants to watch a classy comedy film; well, this movie is a total waste of time for you. I watched this expecting it to be really dumb, but enjoyable and it surpassed my expectations. The plot is simple, the jokes aren't clever but funny, the actors are doing a more than well job. I couldn't ask for more. This one deserves at least a 7 star rating.

Much as I like MacFarlane, and Ribisi is always good value - he's a chameleon - I just couldn't take any more. Charlize Theron looked gorgeous and Liam Neeson - what I saw of him - must have been there to buy in his fan base. If there was any real humour it must have been behind the camera because it sure as heck wasn't in front of it. Look, Blazing Saddles by comparison is comedy gold and 70s western god John Wayne, a comic genius. If you're going to construct sex gags, they've got to be done well. You cant toss them in like sketches on SNL with all the subtlety of a brick between the eyes... oh and they have to be new gags! You know, the sperm on the hookers face... been done before. If it was aimed at 14 year old boys, I understand. So why aim the advertising at an older audience. The plot seemed flimsy and trite. For the half hour that I watched of the film, the break up of a relationship and an old man farting wasn't enough. The set was good...... and I'd have liked to see how the sheep turned out.... but it wasn't enough, sorry.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
280,Abumaor,Fun movie,9,17 September 2020,"This movie is very good. I'm puzzled why the relatively low score here on IMDb.
Personally I think the story was good, acting was not Oscar material but still good and the jokes are awesome. Some unique black humor you don't see often.
I highly recommend.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
281,Fun-Gus,Hilarious!!,7,4 October 2014,"This was a very good deadpan downright hilarious movie and if you watch it you will see this is not childish humor as some suggest, it is just a little over their heads. I found myself laughing at several point in this movie and as they say,""Laughter is the best medicine,"" and I felt great after watching this. You will know fairly quickly if this isn't your cup of tea. If you have ever seen HBO's Eastbound & Down, that is what I consider very poor taste with stupid childish humor and unwatchable, not this little gem. Along with some good shots of the landscape, the movie itself rolls along fairly quickly and did not have a dull moment.

283,pcongleton-1,The shocking and feel-good movie of the Summer all in one.,9,16 June 2014,"There is only so much Seth MacFarlane can do with his voice and writing talent. Now that he has been seen so much in real-life since the Oscars, it is only fitting that he venture out into the world of Live-Action. We all know that his approach to comedy is to shock and to open eyes and since he has the luxury of the R-rating, that is exactly what he does, but with a cute twist. This is a classic story that takes place in the Wild-West, about the good-guy beating the bad guy ....... and getting the girl. He is a man trapped in a town he doesn't understand. A man surrounded by people he can't understand. He is a nice guy living in an environment that is dangerous and life-threatening at almost every turn. This is the only place in the world where people die at the ""Town-Fair"" every year. After being tossed aside by his girlfriend, because he isn't ""tough enough"", he is then befriended by the most beautiful girl in the West. Unfortunately, she is married to the most dangerous outlaw in the entire West and it is from this recipe that the film grows out from and by the end makes you feel good inside. There are a lot of great cameos in this film. There are also plenty of smart funny jokes as well. Sure, the film makes room for all its shocking humor. All the ""poop"" and ""vagina"" jokes. Making fun of conservatives and white people. But, in the end, you can feel what Seth is trying to convey to you. That among all the silliness that makes up this world and all the gross nonsense that human beings can do and all the violence that assholes try to do to their fellow man, love will still prevail.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

285,calle_2565,"What happened, Seth?",2,13 June 2014,"I find it quite rare to not see the funny parts in a comedy. Going in to this film, only to have seen the trailer, I can't say that I'm impressed or surprised that I wasn't impressed.The film itself has impressive visuals, good supporting actors and nice music (apart from one song that I didn't enjoy, but it's catchy). But the script regarding the jokes is all over the place, and I laughed maybe two times throughout the whole film.I enjoyed TED for the fact that the jokes centered around the characters and their dynamic relationship. It felt as if more thought was put into TED. AMWTDITW feels awkward and doesn't connect to either of the characters, it is too random for my taste. Not to speak of the overflow of disgusting jokes to get a cheap laugh.If you HAVE to see the film, you need to go in with an open mind and try to see past that Seth isn't a good live action actor. Also, prepare for the jokes to be repetitive and as I stated, cheap.Otherwise, just save yourself the time and the pain that the film causes (In my case at least).Seth is capable to write good material, but it feels like he needs to expand his thinking, maybe associate himself with different people. You know, get new ideas.Also, that Back to the Future spoof with Christopher Lloyd. Just useless...",A Million Ways to Die in the West
286,Demetrius_Stork,MacFarlane should have stopped with the teddy bear,5,17 December 2015,"This movie was really disappointing for me. After MacFarlane showed that he had a ability to make a good feature film like Ted, I expected this film to at least be solid, but it wasn't so. Poorly written, bad drama, not very funny and lame MacFarlane tropes that really shine through.But let's first talk about the good. The acting is quality, with a lot of clearly funny/talented performers making appearances. Seth MacFarlane stars as Albert, a misfit dweeb in the rough and tough wild west. He's OK but his supporting cast really does an awesome job. Charlize Theron plays Anna, the love interest, and does an alright job. It just looks like she was having fun more than actually acting, which honestly for me is fine in a comedy such as this. Neil Patrick Harris plays a silly, moustached owner of a ""moustachery"" and as you can probably tell, MacFarlane thinks that jokes about facial hair are grade A comedy. But even though some of his lines are awful, my god does he make them work. Patrick Harris can do no wrong in my opinion, unless he's hanging out with little blue people. I really enjoyed Liam Neeson in this movie. I have always wanted to see him play a villain and boy was my wish granted in this movie. Neeson plays Clinch Leatherwood, a notorious outlaw and gunfighter. It's just great, he just has this atmosphere about him that's so intimidating, you know he's a big deal the second he's in the scene. The rest of the cast is funny as well, Amanda Seyfried, Sarah Silverman and Alex Borstein all bring their talents to the screen. Look out for some celebrity cameos too. A lot of people really didn't like this factor of the movie (which I understand), but I love them, it's sort of a game of Where's Waldo. Keep an eye out for Patrick Stewart, Ryan Reynolds, Kaley Cuoco, Ewan McGregor, and a whole bunch more.Besides the acting, this movie is just eh. The plot is tired and not really interesting. The whole underdog story with a pro training them has been done to death. The cursing in this movie is a little much at times, it just seems unnecessary and not believable, think Platoon times two. The cinematography is boring, the sets are whatever, and the scenarios are basic. The climax with Leatherwood isn't really that cool either. It just makes me wish I was watching a good old western with Clint Eastwood or John Wayne instead. But the biggest problem I have in this movie is its attempt at drama and wow is it bad. MacFarlane clearly doesn't know how to write good drama, which makes sense considering the type of comic he is. But I have no idea why he insists on spending so much time on drama in this movie. The relationship between Albert and Anna takes up almost the majority of the film's focus and it just isn't interesting. I have also never been a fan of writers writing themselves into stories and I really hate it here. MacFarlane wrote too many lines about how nice of a guy Albert is how much Anna loves him. Bleh, it just seems like an ego trip to me and I just couldn't buy into it at all. It's just not written very well either, the drama at least, and as I said before it never stops. In Ted 2, a much better MacFarlane film made a year later, the drama is downplayed so that you can focus on the comedy. In this movie, comedy takes the backseat, something that should never happen. Maybe this was just an experiment though and now MacFarlane will learn from his mistakes, it certainly seemed that way in Ted 2.But let's talk about the comedy. How is it? Once again it's just mediocre. There is the occasional joke that can make you giggle and some where I did laugh out loud. But MacFarlane continues the trope of the cut-away, which is a complete hit or miss. Some of the jokes in this movie fall flat too. But when MacFarlane jokes don't work they don't just fall flat, they crash and burn. If a joke doesn't work, it just seems to go on for forever. But ironically when the jokes do work, often times they're just one line or they're brushed over. It's bizarre and it can be really annoying and, at times, even cringe worthy.In conclusion, I didn't really care for this movie. If you're a huge fan of MacFarlane, then there's a good chance you'll enjoy this film. It has his name written all over it, the good and the bad. Honestly if you want to see a movie that shows all of MacFarlane's positives and negatives, this movie is for you. The good casting and at times clever writing butting heads with poorly written drama and hit or miss gags. Not terrible, but don't expect it to do anything special.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
287,dude2010,Nothing but offensive and toilet humor,1,19 June 2014,"In his newest work, Seth MacFarlane made a desperate attempt to create a melting pot of whatever he could find related to Wild West and wrap it up in a humor that pushed the bar of what can be considered as toilet, racist and purely disgusting humor.How such brilliant actors as Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson and Giovanni Ribisi even considered to be a part of this nonsense is beyond my comprehension. My guess would be they were also tricked into this, and didn't know the actual content of the film before it was too late and the contracts were signed. This movie should be called ""how to make a primitive, offensive, toilet level humor movie about nothing, make out several times with Charlize Theron and, eventually make money of this"".",A Million Ways to Die in the West
288,BoboBagina,Lacking in any real Intelligence,2,5 June 2014,"This film had the ability to be very funny, as do all comedies. Each failed attempt at humour designed for 11 year old boys (Fart jokes, poo jokes, penis jokes and the like) was getting worse as the film went on.As Seth is the creator of family guy you expect that when statements are read a scene swap to illustrate that 'joke' is then preceded. This does not work on the big screen. The acting was questionable from Seth and script/dialect was all over the shop. One minute there is a ridiculous death scene followed by a sad man being comforted, and repeat.If you are to make a film like this, then review successful films in the genre from the past and learn, not disregard what works. The ending of the film is predictable and dull/boring. If you are to make a film like this, why not change it up, make it somewhat interesting. In all, Seth failed hugely in this film, I found it very difficult to stay throughout the whole film, which is also way to long. Quick cons: Same old boring jokes, a scene of drug use (dear god stop it), boy gets girl in the end, Seths acting ability. Story/Script.Pros: Theron, Neeson and Giovanni Ribisi made this film up to a 2/10 as they are credible actors who at least attempted to improve the quality.If you are under 18 you might like this, but if you have seen the trailer then you wont laugh. I did laugh at one time when they were talking about ""a dollar bill"".",A Million Ways to Die in the West
289,DirectionWritten,"Hit and miss in the first act, cleaned up by the second and third",8,7 June 2014,"This film is essentially a montage of cameos, modern references, slapstick, gun fights, and sex jokes. But I concur, it all meshes together very well. From the slow opening act to the hilarious final scene with a cameo that could not have been better chosen, it managed to make me laugh almost constantly all the way through. And, that's really hard to do. That's what differentiates comedies from other genres. It's hard to be consistently funny. It's far easier to make a film scary than to make it hysterical. Which is why Seth Macfarlane deserves a lot more credit than he's receiving for writing and directing this. If you had a bad day at work and your feeling down, or you simply want to laugh, follow Seth Macfarlane's A Million Ways To Die In The West.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Going to see this I was thinking ""Okay, maybe this will make me laugh unlike Neighbors."" But Seth MacFarlane missed the shot... literally. Barely and i mean Barely made me laugh and it was just dry. It was just a really weird movie and you can tell that it was definitely produced by Seth. As for the other actors, they did good. I'm not saying Seth wasn't good... it was just an awful movie. No plot, no funny or memorable lines. I certainly hope that 22 Jump Street hits the nail on the head with comedy movies of this summer because this one is definitely not worth spending money to go see. Do Not go see this. It's really boring and just not fun. It's really a Wild Wild Fail.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Well, if you're a Seth fan, you've already seen this movie .... flat out uncoordinated, boring and uncomfortable to sit through. Seth lacks any charisma, and the sudden focus on poopoo and caca makes it like the director was having fun with the actors. Things make no sense at all, they don't relate. Not to mention that sleaze on an aunt who left a haunted property off in her will, not to mention an entirely useless roster of characters. Bad acting, misdirection and not to mention whats with all the emphasis on the retard music in the beginning? Playing songs alone doesn't make a moment resonate, not to mention whats with that vile running/ loud music playing shot.

292,starry42,"Not as hilarious as expected, but funny and entertaining enough",7,7 June 2014,"Seth MacFarlane has always been one of those individuals people either love or hate. Personally, I admire his style of humor, having watched ""Family Guy"" from the beginning, and found ""Ted"" to be a surprise hit. When I saw the first trailer for ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"", literally every scene made me laugh, which is why I was looking forward to this movie. After actually seeing it, I realized there were two different kind of laughs I got: legit laugh (where I found the scene naturally funny) and cringe laughs (where I was grossed out and amused at the same time).Set in 1882 Arizona, MacFarlane and his rowdy posse, which includes the likes of Charlize Theron, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, Amanda Seyfried, and Neil Patrick Harris, provide plenty of laughs via contemporary dialogue in a Western setting. There are sex jokes and fart jokes aplenty, just the kind of stuff one would expect from MacFarlane. Thrown into the mix is Liam Neeson as the villain, who plays his role so straight it's as if he wasn't even aware he was doing a comedy. This makes him the perfect comic foil for MacFarlane and his gang. There are also a couple of hysterical cameos which I won't reveal.Bottom line: It's not by any means the funniest movie of the year so far, or even the decade, but it has enough laughs to keep one entertained. Fans of Seth MacFarlane may enjoy it more than others, and everyone else may call it a hit-or-miss. It's no ""Blazing Saddles"", but it's funny in its own right. This is a case where I will say see it for yourself, and use your own judgement.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
293,alicedick,A Comic Deconstruction of Western Movies,7,10 July 2015,"I really like the basic idea behind this film. It demolishes nostalgia for the American West once and for all. The nineteenth century was a dirty, cruddy, dangerous place and Seth MacFarlane doesn't hesitate to say so.That said, the film has its share of flaws. The animated hallucination sequence is fairly freaky and I could have done without some of the dirtier jokes, not to mention Neil Patrick Harris pooping in somebody else's hat. The cast is great fun - I'll watch Liam Neeson in anything, and Charlize Theron is funny, capable and gorgeous. She and Seth make a great couple.I think the deciding point for most reviewers is whether MacFarlane should have played the leading role or not. I thought he did a good job - I don't think I've ever seen him in anything before this film (never saw Ted or Family Guy). He's very appealing as the nebbish who can't shoot, can't keep his sheep under control and hates everything about where and when he is.And setting a dance sequence to a Stephen Foster song about mustaches?

What were these negative reviews I read on IMDb? Simply put: If you are looking for some deeper meaning brought to you by the art of film, move on. If you enjoyed the slapstick of Airplane! and Blazing Saddles with a touch of modern interpretation, then watch this movie.

I couldn't stand one more diarrhea or fart joke.There were some funny moments in the movie. For example, Sarah Silverman played the part of a woman who worked in a whorehouse and had screwed every man in town numerous times, but who refused to sleep with her doormat boyfriend because she was Christian. I also enjoyed the running joke about nobody smiling in photographs.Generally, however, the movie's humour is more about grossing people out than making them laugh. It's the kind of humour that would appeal to 10-year-old boys. I think we are also supposed to find it funny that every character says ""fuck"" in almost every sentence. I'm not offended by the language but the crudity was greatly overused.I'm surprised that actors such as Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson would waste their time on this script. I wanted to like this movie because of these actors, and I kept thinking it would get better, but it just didn't. I felt that the movie pandered to the lowest common denominator, and it felt boring, crude, and bland. Just not my kind of movie.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

MacFarlane never managed to settle on a tone - one minute he's cracking wise like we the audience are supposed to be in on his ""I know it's supposed to be 1882, but we all know it's really 2014"" inside jokes; next he's resorting to gross-out potty humor; next he's throwing in non sequiturs like it's ""Airplane.""

302,yem777,Very Funny for a Particular Crowd,9,30 May 2014,"I came into this movie with low expectations, but when I came out my face hurt from laughing so much. To be fair, this is a movie has an uninspiring plot and appears to be poorly edited. While the lousy editing may bother some, I thought it was intentional and actually worked well, poking fun at the hundreds of not-that-well edited westerns.If you're expecting an actual western, don't. This movie put a lot of work into satirizing westerns, and I think it did a pretty good job. Personally, I'm a very casual western fan, just enough of one to understand a lot of the satire, but not enough of one to be ""offended"" that it ""tainted the genre"" or whatever critics are saying.I saw one promo for this movie that claimed basically claimed: if you liked Ted you'll like this movie. I actually think that's a pretty good characterization. This movie is PACKED with R-rated humor that is ridiculous and over-the-top, and I loved that. The ""serious"" love story plot line is, to be fair, not that great (or serious). Charlize Theron did a great job, but Seth MacFarlane is no Mark Wahlberg. Seth is much funnier, but the romantic moments here don't compare to Ted. There's a reason MacFarlane usually plays voice overs, but his physical appearance didn't make him any less funny.So in summary, if you like the idea of making fun of westerns, liked the humor in Ted, and can come in with an open and understanding mindset, I think you'll really enjoy this movie.9/10",A Million Ways to Die in the West

So hopefully my 10 will off-set it a little bit.This movie is what you expect from Seth. Dirty toilet, masturbatory, off-color, laugh-out-loud comedy. Nothing more, and honestly it can't be less. If you want to just go to a movie and just laugh, forgetting any redeeming cinematic quality, this is the movie for you. If you can get over the inaccurate history, use of words that did not exist in 1882, and some of the truly stomach-clenching, barf-out-loud scenes, then you will truly enjoy this ""film.""

I do not understand why Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried, Liam Neeson, Giovanni Ribisi, Neil Patrick Harris, Ewan McGregor, Ryan Reynolds and many other actors and actresses needed to be a part of this uninspiring and very, very bad project. I never liked westerns. I always found them boring, stuck in simple clichéd storytelling, full of ugly dirty characters with poor dental hygiene and appalling standards of personal grooming. This movie does not display the last two traits, since most characters have pearly white teeth and seem washed and combed, but the rest of the clichés are present. This is supposed to be a comedy. I struggled to find it funny. There were only a very few scenes that may be considered funny. Mostly, it is brimming with bad toilet humor, uninspiring acting, boring and unimaginative storytelling. The man around whom this movie had been constructed, Seth McFarlane, does not make his character neither lovable nor pitiful. He is simply an obnoxious, irritating and useless man who does not deserve any of the good stuff that happens to him. Even though I knew that he could not be killed, being the corner stone of the movie, I was secretly wishing for his character to die a horrible death some of the supporting characters were suffering. Watching this movie was a waste of my time. I can not understand what made me sit through all of it. I hope I will forget it fast.

311,stevec-35,Not as bad as some of the reviews indicate,8,14 April 2015,A Million Ways to die in the West is obviously not perfect and there is a definite over supply of potty humor but I still felt entertained and isn't that what watching a movie is all about?. Some of the jokes made me cringe but there are definite laugh out loud moments. This movie is definitely nowhere near as bad as some of the IMDb reviews indicate.The two strongest elements in my view were Charlize Theron who plays the wife of the gunfighter outlaw Clinch and the musical score by Joel McNeely. McNeely has come up with one of the best western musical scores ever written in my opinion. Seth McFarlane mostly does a good job and Sarah Silverman is often hilarious as the town prostitute who still keeps to her Christian values.Sure it's often very silly but it still pushed the right buttons for me. 8 stars out of 10.,A Million Ways to Die in the West
312,mkcross,A Million reasons to see this movie,9,8 June 2014,"I saw A Million Ways to Die in the West 2 nights ago and man was it worth the $9.50 I paid, saying this movie has a lot of dirty jokes in it is an understatement, but they are funny and put in ways that are relatable and make sense. While I can't say this is the best movie I've ever seen, it's worth checking out because lets face it, if Seth Macfarlane is in a movie, It has to have good dirty jokes. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is the 1 plot hole with Clint and threatening to shoot Anna and her dog because Albert was caught kissing her, because we see her being a master at shooting why doesn't she just shoot and kill Clint in the first place rather than allowing him to have the control that he did? Movie villain logic I guess.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
313,dch48,Better than I expected,8,24 October 2014,"I wasn't expecting much when I rented this from Vudu since I didn't like Ted very much at all, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is actually a very funny movie and is well acted by everyone concerned. I'm giving it an 8 out of 10.I'm not a big fan of Family Guy and only find it occasionally funny but I think McFarlane has taken big strides forward with this latest offering. He has done a good job in his triple role as actor, producer, and director.I liked the cameos by Christopher Lloyd and Gilbert Gottfried as well. I hadn't seen either in a while and it was nice to see them again, if only for a brief time.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
314,alizekeriya,Liam Neeson is the only reason to watch!,6,16 July 2014,"Like MacFarlane's directorial debut,Ted, this was also over-hyped, after seeing Ted and disliking it to an extent, I decided to watch this, as I am quite fond of the Western genre. It basically plays out like a feature length episode of Family Guy. It is not really my cup of tea, but it had some selling points to it, namely Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron. Now the only good thing is Liam Neeson's acting and that Badass look and voice he has, but sadly he is not that long in it. Seth's acting kind of seems forced and weird, it probably has a lot to do with the language. Now I don't mind the F word or other cursing but it didn't seem to fit in the film's Timeline and also fell flat, as it seemed to be cursing just for the sake of cursing. The other good points in the film are Christopher Lloyd's cameo (as SPOILER!!!!!!!! Doc Brown!) and Jamie Foxx ( SPOILER!!!!!!!!!! presumably reprising his role from Django Unchained). The jokes seem tired and outdated and the film relies mainly on toilet humour. Some actors from Ted are also featured in this, but only Giovanni Ribisi stands out as one of the supporting actors. In conclusion I presume this film is not for everyone, but Family Guy fans and Seth MacFarlane fans. So don't expect a nonstop comedy flick, as it only offers a few good chuckles, at least to me.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
315,quehouse,Waste of talent,2,17 October 2014,"Seth, Seth. You should have let someone else read the script before money was spent making this. I tried and tried to like it and kept waiting for the funny parts. Kept wanting to walk away from this movie but I couldn't believe that with this much talent in the movie that it wouldn't get better. It didn't. Seth MacFarlane, Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson what a great cast. Obviously they did it for the money not the entertainment value. Poorly directed.

321,garman-productions,another bad movie with actors showing bad judgment,1,13 April 2015,"""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is a terrible movie by Seth McFarlane who seriously believes vulgarity and bad taste is funny and demonstrates with regularity his twisted juvenile lack of intellect. When I read some of the favorable reviews on this piece of trash I had to add my opinion to bring down the overall rating for this disgusting excuse for satirical ""comedy"".Lacking wit and style, and focused on sex and ""potty humor"" the talent lacking Seth delivers another Hollywood funded piece of garbage that is both offensive and unfunny. That Theron and Liam N. would put themselves in this terrible exercise in tastelessness shows bad judgment on their part and an unlimited desire to make money, regardless of the quality of the script.I actually felt sorry for Christopher Lloyd making a cameo in this movie because it reveals his desperation over his waning career. And throwing ""f bombs"" around as a sign of humor is really a demonstration of the wasteland that is Seth's brain. I really hope he stops ""making movies"" because he cannot write, direct, or act. Avoid this movie unless you are writing a college paper on the deterioration of American comedy.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

323,crashdavis18,I love this movie,9,10 September 2018,"So, it should go without saying that comedy is subjective. I can understand that there are all kinds of people who would say that this movie is not for them. To each his own.That having been said said, if you like Family Guy even a little bit, I would be surprised if you didn't really like this movie.The story was probably just meant to be a bare framework for a million jokes to be told in the west. That said, it's a pretty good story, especially for a comedy. There is nothing more annoying at this point than: boy meets girl; boy throws away a perfectly good thing over something silly; boy 'Harvey Weinsteins' his way back into her life, because stalking makes everything better. As romance goes in movies, comedies or otherwise, this story is completely not in any way annoying.Far more importantly, this movie has the hallmark of the classics. When I first saw it, the obvious jokes were funny, ... really funny. The key though is that on a second, third, fifth, seventh viewing, you notice the more subtle jokes, which are equally, if not more, hilarious.There was not an actor in this movie whose characterizations and lines were disappointing, exactly the opposite. I love this movie even more every time I see it. How on god's green earth could someone not like a movie with Liam Neeson, Charlize Theron , Amanda Seyfried, NPH, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, and on and on, all at the top of their game? On top of which, one written by Seth MacFarlane, who is really good as a non-animated actor.If you dislike the Family Guy, I don't think it should come as a complete shock to you that this movie might not instantly rank on your list of top 10 all-time classics (although stranger things have happened). Otherwise, watch it. Watch it once and, if you aren't completely blown away, watch it again. Give it a little more time, then watch it again. I have a feeling that you won't be disappointed.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
324,rocketrider231,Filled with Gross-out Humor and Few Redeeming Qualities,4,17 July 2014,"Seth MacFarlane is mainly famous for presenting us with the television show Family Guy and the 2012 comedy Ted. I enjoy sitting down and watching Family Guy on occasion, and I really enjoyed Ted. That being said, I was excited to see A Million Ways To Die In The West.A Million Ways To Die In The West has a rather cluttered plot. So in the simplest way I can describe what the film is about: MacFarlane's character, Albert, is a shy farmer in the West. Then after Albert's girlfriend (played by Amanda Seyfried) breaks up with him, Anna (Charlize Theron) strolls into town and develops a friendship with Albert and teaches him how to shoot, and I can't really get into anything else about this cluttered plot without confusing anyone or spoiling anything.After seeing Neighbors (probably the funniest movie I've seen so far this summer) I was excited to see A Million Ways To Die In The West. So, is it as funny as Neighbors? Is it the comedy that everyone needs to see this summer? Well, sadly, no, it isn't even close to being that. The movie as a whole is not very funny or enjoyable.Before getting into any of my negatives, allow me to start with the positives. First of all, Sarah Silverman and Giovanni Ribisi are probably the funniest part about this movie. They have great chemistry and they're quippy and funny. Also, Liam Neeson continues to be awesome in all his roles. No matter how bad the movie is, he's always great in his roles. Another thing the film has going for it is a handful of unexpected cameos that made me smile and go ""Hey look! it's _____!"" whenever one came on.Getting into the negatives, Seth MacFarlane does have a few moments where his humor shines, but 80% of the time, it falls flat. Neil Patrick Harris (who plays Albert's ex' new boyfriend) seriously did not make me laugh once. His character especially annoyed me and I did not enjoy any moment in which he was on screen. Also, Amanda Seyfried's character feels like dead weight, whose presence is only being used for a plot point that could have easily been tailored out.The humor in this movie doesn't consist of the clever humor that Ted had. Instead, it relies heavily on gross-out humor and offensive humor, similar to some of the newer episodes of Family Guy. Right now I can name at least three moments of this movie that made me cringe and go ""Oh gosh..."" out of the sheer grossness of what was happening. I even heard someone in the theater say out loud ""That was NOT necessary to show..."" And frankly, they couldn't have been more right. I'm not going to lie, I did chuckle at a few jokes (mainly due to Silverman and Ribisi), but I can probably count all the times I laughed on my fingers.Despite all this, A Million Ways To Die In The West does has an EPIC cameo in the final thirty seconds that literally made me laugh out loud in awe (not the one shown in the trailers). It actually made me consider bumping up my rating from a 4/10 to a 5/10, and it might just be worth sitting through the movie just to see. Sitting through all the gross-out jokes, crude humor, disgusting gags, and unfunny dialogue...actually, on second thought, you'd probably be better off just YouTubing a collaboration video of all the cameos and avoiding this film entirely.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

327,khalidabusamra,Forget the Critics! Go watch it..,6,29 May 2014,"It never quite hits the advertised number, but as ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" goes on, it keeps a pretty good running total: Cholera, gun battle, rattlesnake, knifefight, hanging.But as creator Seth MacFarlane could tell you, for a comedian there's only one way to die: Be unfunny.He had a taste of mortality hosting the Oscars two years ago, when some of his jokes didn't just offend, but — worse — fell flat. And he certainly knew he was risking a lot with this new movie, a comedy western.Well -dodged a bullet.Because ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is, yes, often offensive and juvenile. (It's Seth MacFarlane, after all.) But it's also often funny and even occasionally pretty clever.Starring in his own script, MacFarlane plays Albert, an intelligent and smartly cautious man who's somehow ended up as a sheepherder in the Wild West. Which he hates with almost as much passion as he loves his schoolmarm girlfriend, Louise.But she leaves him for a rich man, and it seems as if things couldn't get much worse. Except then the territory's worst gunslinger passes through, and his wife begins to take a shine to this shy shepherd. And suddenly things do, indeed, get a whole lot worse, MacFarlane, who directs as well, isn't the most obvious movie star. With his pleasant but inexpressive face and shoe-button eyes, he looks a little like ""Ted,"" the dirty teddy bear he created (he talks like him, too) — cuddly but unengaged.The movie also misses out on a nice joke by having everyone sound alike — which is to say, like the same, foul-mouthed, 21st-century cynic. It keeps Albert from standing out; it'd be funnier if everyone but he spoke with florid 19th-century style.But MacFarlane is game for pratfalls, and he has a good supporting cast around him, including Neil Patrick Harris as a romantic rival, Sarah Silverman as a perpetually upbeat hooker, Liam Neeson as that dreaded gunslinger and a few surprise guest stars — including one post-credits one — whose identities I'll keep secret here.He also has a secret weapon in Charlize Theron who showed her taste for rude comedy in ""Young Adult"" but hasn't gotten much of a chance since. Here, as the gunman's wife, she cuts a confident, eye-catching figure (and occasionally uncorks a terrific dirty laugh) while still rooting her character in reality. As a comedian, MacFarlane often can't help going for the gross-out joke. There barely a bodily fluid that not only gets its own gag, but gag-worthy closeup, too; his slightly self- conscious, I'm-a-bad-boy act also includes the usual non-PC tweaks at race and religion.But as a filmmaker, he shows a real appreciation for genre (the movie starts with shots of John Ford's beloved desert landscapes, and a rolling Elmer Bernstein-style score). Some flashes of style, too, particularly in a psychedelic dream out of Dali, and some clever in- jokes.Admitted, for all its wild satire and crude humor, ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is no ""Blazing Saddles"" (although it does share a fondness for jokes about passing gas); only briefly does it risk going as fearlessly over the comedy cliff as Mel Brooks did regularly.But it's well-made, often (and outrageously) funny, and manages to keep up the pace and interest for nearly two hours. Clearly there's more to MacFarlane than a bad Oscar show, ""Ted"" and some Fox-TV toons. It'll be fun to see what he finds funny next.i'll give it 6 out of 10.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
328,andrecluff,Best comedy of the summer,9,31 May 2014,From start to finish it was the funniest movie so far for this year. Even funnier than neighbors. Seth is a genius when it comes to making people laugh. It's not the retarded type of things. Its the smart or intellectual type of conversations in the movie. This movie has an all star cast and there was exceptional chemistry between both Seth and chalice. This comedy was thought out perfectly and the lines made sense. Oh there is a guess appearance at the end that you will find to be most entertaining. I would not listen to the credits at all it was good from start to finish. Your not wasting your money at all worth it. Apparently in the movie there really is a million ways to die in the west and Seth names most of them.,A Million Ways to Die in the West

The jokes were not that funny and most were so obvious that you could see them coming for miles.The cast was great. They all played their parts well and delivered their lines respectably and believably, but the material was quite weak. The first half of the movie was a real trial for me to get through. I took my teenage nephews to see it and they even thought it was ""lame."" It seemed to get a little better in the last half, but it was a far cry from the brilliant ""Blazing Saddles"" (the movie it so obviously wanted to be).I have seen many far worse comedies, but this one will never be in the same league with ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Airplane!"", ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""Tropic Thunder.""",A Million Ways to Die in the West
330,beegalindo,"Wit and hijinks from Seth, a feature length western comedy ala blazing saddles but not quite its peer",7,23 December 2019,"McFarlane gets assists from some great actors, which kind of smooths over his lack of presence as a comedic actor. I think he's brilliant as a writer, cartoonist, creator, and with voices, but as an actor here he comes across a bit too normal, or maybe plain is the adjective. I contrast this with his role as the entitled, egotistical boss in Ted, a more memorable performance.However he has some hilarious deliveries, and his supporting cast do a lot to make the film as a whole fully enjoyable. It put me in a great mood and was fun from start to finish. I thought a feature length film would be tough for McFarlane to pull off, but there was no point where i thought ""enough, already"" or ""where are they going with this"", the whole picture hangs together well.Best Performance was for the character Edward played by Giovanni Ribisi.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

An interesting inconsistent misfire,4,31 May 2014,This review comes from someone who likes Famnily Guy and really enjoyed TED... but this new one... was... ouch... I went in expecting a few laughs but there were fewer than even my low expectations predicted. Other than the script everything is top notch. Actors are great. Charlize and Liam and Sarah Silverman etc are terrific. It's too bad they didn't have something better to work with. Liam in fact seems like he's in a different movie. He's 100 percent serious. That might be Seth's point in making a guy (himself) who is caught in the middle of a serious horrible deadly world that the west really was.It looks very good visually. Great score. But very inconsistent. Not hit and miss. More like hit and miss miss miss groan miss semi-hit miss. And the joke style kept changing. Silly to sweet to over the top and serious at times. and some of the jokes were so disgusting I don't know what they were thinking. (and i like disgusting) Plus the anachronistic style gets tired fast. And Seth as predicted should not have made himself the lead. He's not awful but would have benefited greatly with a pro. His persona is not fit for leading man status. And his voice and style is so in step with Brian's on family guy its a bit distracting. Basically the tone of this film keeps changing. The joke styles keep changing. it doesn't know what it is. Is is a sweet western romcom? Is it a satire? Is it a serious comedy? With all the success from Ted I'm guessing Seth had carte blanche with this one and probably needed someone to question him more. Might be more fun if your stoned. Really really stoned.

Granted, jokes are not in very good taste mostly, but it also has subtle ones which I enjoyed. And after over 100 years of comedy movies,being surprised by one is great. The cast works. I thought Giovanni Ribisi was hilarious. Also Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson are good. Seth Macfarlane is not known in my country, but I think he was great on this movie.

This is probably not a movie for my Bluray collection but I will definitely be adding it to my DVD collection!!! Both me and dad agreed we would see it again in the cinema! The cast were great and I laughed a lot in this movie. Considering this is Seth's second ever Directorial I think he did a cracking job. If you've seen TED, its on the same comedy lines as that film and at some points I was in stitches!! As we were walking over to the cinema I was told that the critics weren't raving about it, which did put a little doubt in my mind. But that was wiped away as the film got started.

Bloody, violent, almost undisguised swearing and jealousy.2. Is this movie funny? Absolutely funny. Even if it is swearing, it sounds like the right swearing.3. Does this movie let you know about the western United States? Yes, it will be a little bit. For those who can only learn about the American West from movies and games, this is a lively and interesting learning material, although its content is somewhat exaggerated and time-out.4. Is this movie only the above? Do not. The second half of the movie has greatly sublimated it. In the second half of the movie, McFarland played the actor's normal. Although he was still swearing, violent, and incompetent, he did not look different from the beginning of the film. He became a living person, no longer a movie character. . He worked hard, he was timid, he ran away, and he made up his mind. Until he came back, he returned to the town. When I saw his feet into the town and walked into the camera, I was a little choked. He defeated the villain played by Liam Nissen, not by the sharpshooter, but by his wisdom. If you work hard, you will have a reward, and you will improve yourself. This is confirmed at this time. Although he did not become a sharpshooter, he won the cheers and glamour of the whole town, including Anna.

I think Sarah and Neil and Giovanni could have been used more and I wish we could have seen a little more Back to the Future references, but all in all this was a slow smoldering fire that kept you warm and didn't go out.If your looking for traditional Seth or split your sides humor, this ain't it. But what else is out there. I thought Ted was unwatchable. I've tried to get through that thing twice and failed. I guess my IQ is triple digits, because most comedies these days take the easy way out. Let's f*rt, that's funny. P*ss in his face, that's funny. Sh*t in a hat, that's funny. Now, while this movie has all of these, I think this is where this movie falls short. Where is succeeds is when the writing gets anachronistic, like when Seth and Giovanni see things more the way we do today and everyone else is stuck in 1880's or the Back to the Future scene or the Indian's translating scene or the trip scene or the Mustache song scene. All of these worked for me and had me laughing. Seth don't listen to these hacks, transition yourself, get rid of the toilet humor and work on more sophisticated movies like this one.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
344,enderwilliam22,Could have been so much better,6,30 May 2014,"Don't get me wrong. This was a funny movie, but it is no where near Ted or Family Guy or typical Macfarlane work. There were too many actual serious, regular romantic comedy stuff in this. I wasn't looking to see a typical romantic comedy where a wussy sheep farmer overcome his own fears and get the woman of his dreams, I was wanting to see a slap-stick western that was all Family Guy style humor, and while it was there in parts the trailer gave the best moments from the movie. I went in expecting to laugh a lot more. In addition, I feel like some of the characters could've been better. Theron and Harris were great, but I was disappointed in Liam Neeson's character. I was expecting a more funny villain, instead Neeson played an actual asshole outlaw (when he shot that old man at the beginning I felt that was way too dark for this type of movie). So overall this movie is funny, but not up to Macfarlane's usual standards, the funny parts were sandwiched between romantic comedy, serious stuff and I just felt like this made the movie seem rushed and out of sync. 6/10",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Many of the jokes were either over used and clique or too disgusting. I also didn't how Liam Neeson was shown briefly in the beginning, but was completely ignored until very late in the movie. It has one of those awkward plots where there are two main conflicts that are almost unrelated. First is the conflict of Seth's character trying to get his girlfriend back. Once that is finally resolved near the end of the movie,Liam Neeson comes to claim revenge on Seth for seeing his wife. Besides that most of the jokes are funny. Its definitely not the most memorable comedy, but its still worth watching.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

348,nick-kohn1,A million ways to be disappointed,4,29 May 2014,"If there's one thing about Seth MacFarlane, it's that he is usually always funny and rarely serious. After watching Ted, all of Family Guy, and his other works, I expected this movie to deliver extremely funny moments. Instead, the movie had more serious scenes than the whole family guy series.Seth's acting was pretty good, but it is better if he sticks to animation as it seems speaking through a dog is much more suiting to him. The whole movie seemed like his typical style of comedy, but without as much hilarity as there should have been.The movie passes the time quite quickly and isn't very long, so it's one to see if you're a fan on Seth, but not one to see if you are not familiar with any of his work.The addition of Liam Neeson was absolutely retarded. Why put a man with such an accent in 1882 in the middle of Arizona. Absolutely wrong choice of cast. Perhaps Jamie Foxx was meant to rip of Django, but he had only five seconds in the whole movie.Seth has a long way to go as an actor. Animation is clearly his strong suit. The movie is surprising that there is moments of emotion, but in essence, the movie is nothing more than a sit down and watch Seth's movie. After all, it really was only his movie and it seemed he created everything in the movie.I enjoyed some comedic moments, and the ending was interesting. However, the rest of the movie is not to be taken seriously. Only watch if you are interested in Seth or have nothing to do for 90 minutes.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

That is to say, I've seen so much of Seth MacFarlane's work to know his sense of humour comfortably well.OK, the movie is trite and the screenplay won't win awards, but it's bright, the scenery is amazing, the timing is reasonably fast-paced, and the quick-witted chemistry between Seth and Charlize plays out fairly well for the bulk of the film.Also, there are plenty of jokes to enjoy and plenty of cameos to look out for. Some jokes are weird, vague, or just plain dirty. But really, after twelve seasons of Family Guy, what were you expecting, Shakespeare?If you're looking for a dramatic, earth-shattering movie that will question existence and alter the way you view humanity, don't see this movie. But, I guess, if you bought tickets to a Seth MacFarlane movie without knowing what you're getting yourself into, it's kind of your own fault now, isn't it?If, however, you're a fan of the offbeat and immature sense of humour that embodies Family Guy, this movie will most likely be a fun and easy-going way to pass two hours of your time.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

355,neba91,"Disappointing, but not bad",6,3 September 2014,"Seth McFarlane, the man behind ""Family Guy"", which is often regarded (and often disputed) as the only true competition for the legendary ""The Simpsons"" had hit the jackpot with ""Ted"" back in 2012. His unique and controversial sense of humor is sewn through with a healthy doze of satirical view on contemporary American society and modern pop culture in general. With all this taken into account, along with the fact that ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is set in late 19th century, the movie generated a lot of excitement and expectations upon its release.Still, as it often happens, what we got is disappointing. It's not a bad comedy, but, it's not a good one either. There are some scenes, early in the movie, that can make you laugh your guts out, but as the movie unfolds it becomes repetitive and the story itself is not strong enough to distract you from the mediocre humor. McFarlane could be worse in his role and this way to said it says a lot. Theron, a respected and proved diva, is in this movie mostly because of her stunning looks, her role is far from being challenging, therefore her acting is OK, but nothing more. Neeson is a standard when it comes to bad guys and feels at home in his role while Sarah Silverman plays a part that's totally written for her style of comedy. Neil Patrick Harris is definitely Barney here, although his ""challenge accepted"" in this movie was actually a nice pun, if we can call it that way. Also, Jamie Foxx as Django and Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmet Brown were convenient cases of ""breaking of the fourth wall"", to put it that way, and a nice nod to two classic movies.What's great about the not-too-strong narrative is the symbolism of wild west setting. McFarlane presents the dangers of this time nicely with his black humor, which is a subtle allusion to modern Hollywood and the fact that there's a million ways to die"" professionally in a merciless wild west of today's movie industry.In the end, all the bad things in this movie could be acceptable if the humor alone was at the high level throughout the film, which is something we know McFarlane can achieve. Things being as they are, there are far worse comedies, but my advice is to prepare for a disappointment, although, I can't say that there's no chance that this movie will leave a good impression on a viewer, especially if viewed as light fun with some friends and couple of beers.65/100",A Million Ways to Die in the West

However it is a smart and fun movie with a great and happy ending. When I initially started to watch it I couldn't stand the movie because I expected something much funnier. With lower expectations I tried again and this time I found it to be great. A lot of the humor contained in the movie you could smile in your head and say...yes I see what you're going for.

360,wsidejack1,"Profane, Insane, and Inane. Loved It!",8,7 December 2017,"This movie is a satire of a massive film genre, American Western movies, and the Old West itself. It mocks and makes ridiculous all the mainstays of those films, which, like all movies, are not historically accurate, and it also has fun with quite a few realistic aspects of life on the frontier itself. For example, in recorded history there are VERY, VERY few instances of anyone fanning a gun (pulling back the hammer repeatedly by running his opposite hand across the top of it), because it made your shots go wild and it was an excellent way to get yourself killed. Similarly, two gunmen meeting at a prearranged time (high noon?) in the middle of the street, much less counting to three or one of them letting the other man draw first, are also Hollywood fantasies, as are conversations between the two combatants, as seemingly happened more and more over time in movies starting with the Psychological Westerns of the 1950s.Just like in Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal,"" which I think most of us were forced to read in high school and we could not get what the guy was trying to say, this movie is not to be taken on face value. The intent is to have a good laugh and to poke fun at certain things about the Old West and its depiction in movies.Yet, there is apparently a reverence in this movie for some of the conventions of classic Westerns. Actor Seth McFarlane, who plays a sheepherder in this movie, is named Stark. Perhaps this is a thinly veiled reference to the main character, Joe Starrett, in the Western classic movie ""Shane""--a peaceful farmer who is threatened by the local cattle baron. Also, did anyone notice that in the center of the main street in the town this movie is set in, there is a large old tree stump? That's equivalent to having a twenty foot high pile of massive stones in the middle of a three lane modern highway. It shouldn't be there for all practical purposes.So why did McFarlane and the other writers put it there? Because such a tree stump is part of a prominent scene in both ""Shane"" and, if I recall correctly, the more recent classic ""Pale Rider"" (starring Clint Eastwood). In both cases there is a scene where the threatened farmer/miner bonds with the gunfighter who is there to help him (Alan Ladd as Shane or Clint Eastwood in ""Pale Rider"") by the pair laboriously chopping out a large old tree stump on his land with axes, when it would have been so much easier to blow it up. Finally, I wonder if some of the stars of this movie were specifically chosen with satire in mind. Neeson and Theron are both foreign born, but are in an American western? And Neil Patrick Harris is the new boyfriend of McFarlane's lost love Louise?",A Million Ways to Die in the West

368,jdowlicious,A Million Better Ways To Spend Your Time,3,2 August 2014,"Seth MacFarlene has always been a mixed bag. No doubt he is an incredible voice actor, but a lot of his own creative projects have been inconsistent, to say the least. His latest outing, A Million Ways to Die in the West is no different, and boy, it's a doozy.The meandering plot follows Macfarlene as Albert, a loser sheep farmer recently dumped by his girlfriend (Seyfried) for a richer, better looking mustached man. He runs into Anna (Theron), starting a forced romantic plot and then... nothing happens for an hour until the movie remembers Liam Neeson is in the movie for a huge anti-climax.There may have been a decent movie that could have been saved out of this film in editing. But holy crap, this movie has no sense of pace. It's nearly 2 hours long and feels like an eternity, the main issue that causes this is the stop/start nature of the movie. There will be a small scene, something will happen and then Aeon Flux and Brian will talk about it going ""I got to get out of the west, it's crazy!"" They wasted so much talent in the movie. Giovanni Ribsi is a one joke character (A virgin? No way!). Amanda Seyfried has been hilarious in the past, but here she is subjected to being extremely one-note and boring. Before you go 'hey, that's the point of the character!', her character is extremely vain and selfish, sure, but she was great playing the same sort of roles with similar characteristics in the past. Here she has no funny lines, or nothing. And Liam Neeson. So much potential for humour and yet the funniest thing that happens to him is that his wife sticks a flower in his ass. Yup.I guess the only thing I found redeeming were the cameos, but in my opinion, cameos are a desperate form of humour. Sure, there's the brief moment of surprise, you're taken off guard and laugh. Then again, pretty much all the humour desperate - sheep dicks, people farting/shitting for like a minute straight... but I guess the worst thing of all was the movie was just boring. It was a slog to get through, and I could tell the others in the cinema were getting restless constantly checking their watches and phones.

After the success of Ted (which I thought was decent) MacFarlane obviously thought he could do no wrong but 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' brings him crashing back to Earth in spectacular fashion.Here's the plot: (may contain spoilers) It's set in 1882 in Arizona, MacFarlane plays a nerdy, out of his depth but supposedly 'charming' sheep farmer who loses his girlfriend (Seyfried) and then unwittingly befriends the wife (Theron) of the most dangerous gunslinger in the territory (Neeson). That's it really, there isn't a whole lot else going on.There's so many problems with this film that it's hard to know where to start, I suppose MacFarlane is the main problem because he's the one who's genuinely out of his depth. He's totally devoid of any humour or charm and he's also totally incapable of propping up a movie as the lead. It's far too long, it's loaded with tired and repetitive jokes, MacFarlane actually assembled a good cast but largely ignores them in favour of himself (ego trip) and worst of all he actually tried to inject a serious love story, which turns out to be cringe worthy at best.I honestly didn't laugh once during this painful experience and neither did most people in the quarter full cinema, maybe 3 or 4 smiles, that's as good as it got for me.

A ton more could have been done with this film as well(especially the main plot), but it is by no means as bad as some on here make it out to be.

Sure she cringed at a few spots, but that was part of the entertainment.rzajac says it below much better than I can, and he summarizes the movie perfectly when he says how can this movie be rated below other comedies, when you laugh out loud more with this movie than you have in a long time.Grab some popcorn, and plan to escape the real world for a bit with this over-the-top, funny, entertaining flick.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
374,OLD_ACCOUNT_skribb_Mk2,"Hilarious ""Stoner Western"" in the vein of Van Wilder, South Park, Austin Powers",8,19 June 2016,"I loved this movie, and I give it an 8. I would have given it a 9 if it wasn't for the fact that it felt like Seth's character was a time-traveller who for some reason needs to be in 1882 (or somehow got stuck there). And when the movie starts he's been in 1882 for a few weeks, and that's the reason why he's commenting on how life in the old west sucks, all the time (don't let this discourage you as the movie has a lot more to offer). Most other characters seem to be more ""authentically"" portrayed.Don't understand why they didn't polish the script more. Seth's ""social commentary"" jokes felt out of place quite often, again, because it seemed like he had traveled back in time and tries to point out to everyone how awful their epoch is to live in. This was a huge annoyance for me. But the rest of the movie was amazing. Good ""stoner movie"" in terms of attitude and visual content.Ribisi's character was hilarious, and Silverman was great too. One particular celebrity cameo was THE EFFING BOMB and I give the film makers a huge cyber hug for it.Pretty solid acting all around, with Seth obviously being the weak link, altho he was in no way bad - but there were a few cringey scenes/lines were they could have tweaked the script and done a few more takes to allow his delivery to improve. 8 peyote cactii out of 10.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
375,komsikkids01,Disappointing,5,3 February 2015,"The film feels disjointed on a number of levels. For much of the first hour, what little narrative drive there is gets lost in a series of comedy routines that are pretty hit and miss. After introducing Liam Neeson's villainous Clinch Leatherwood as the prime antagonist, MacFarlane allows him to vanish from the entire mid section, leaving a love story to develop between Albert and Anna. We get supporting turns from Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman, as well as Seyriend and Harris, but while sporadically amusing, none of the threads are funny or interesting enough to make the film feel like it's really going anywhere. There are enough successful gags to prevent boredom setting in, but the film can't decide where it wants to settle down. Even the central gag contained within the title – that the American West was a terrible place to be – isn't really pursued with much vigour.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
376,djshane378,One of my top favorite movies!,10,17 July 2017,"I actually didn't know much about Seth MacFarlane until I saw the movie Ted. Never was into Family Guy. I'm more of a South Park guy LOL which I know he hates. But after Watching Ted I could not wait to see this movie when I saw the trailer for it in theaters. The only negative I can say about this movie is that there was too much of the greatest moments put into the actual trailer. So that kind of took some of the laughter away because you'd already seen it once. However I admired every bit of this film. The production values, cinematography, music score, the comedy, the writing, and the cast was excellent. I actually get what he was trying to do. And I think his acting was pretty good as well. I think he created a great character and played it just fine. I can even find myself relating to his character with heartbreak which I was going through at the time I saw this movie, and I've been that oddball before. Come to think of it I think I still am LOL. I think the unrated uncut version of this movie was the best. I laughed even harder when I saw that version. If I wanted to create my own Western film, I think I would have done everything the same way. I know he is proud of this film. And I'm sure he doesn't care that this movie has gotten mixed reviews. Some people I've talked to love this movie and some thinks it's stupid. But I'm with McFarland on this one, I'm sure he didn't care about the ratings he just wanted to make his own Western film how he's always dreamed of doing it. And I thank him for that. Because I really enjoyed watching it. Thank you Seth McFarland. Don't let the internet trolls stop you from making more films when they tell you to stick with animation.

Myself and my three mates were pretty excited as we sat down to watch this film, the trailer had me howling and made it look pretty cool. I think Family guy is great, as too American Dad. And I thought Ted was really very funny and had a decent script. About 20 minutes into the film I'd noticed there hadn't been much laughter at all from any of us. I stared at my mate and we both had this look of utter disappointment and bewilderment on our little faces.Some reviewers have given this an eight, stating it's 'the funniest film they've seen in ages'. I'm sorry, but they either have really bad taste in films, weren't watching the same film I was, or are part of the films production.Honestly, I was so disappointed.

Perhaps if this world was not so ridiculously politically correct these days then it might have. I would also be interested to know a general statistic on the type of people who gave this film such a low rating, and also wonder why they bothered to even watch it in the first place; it would be akin to myself watching art house films and rubbishing them just because I did not like the genre...ridiculous!At least Seth can console himself with the fact that he will always be more successful and popular than most of the snobby and conceited so-called 'Film Critics' that disparage a film because it is not intelligent enough for them; or the camera shots were not arty enough; or there was no clever lighting. Maybe it's time for a review site that does not take into account the pretentious and malicious ramblings of these pompous nobodies, and actively prevents the biased aspersions of the PC brigade too.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
383,foolforfilm,Abysmal,1,31 May 2014,"After seeing several depressing foreign movies about Jews dying under the Nazis, I figured it's time for a big-time all color American comedy. Wrong.Today I had the misfortune to see A Million Ways to Die in the West. Because Seth MacFarlane is clearly a genius, I figured I'd give him a second chance (second, after seeing his disaster hosting the Academy Awards a few years ago; you can't hold a grudge forever).But – this film has nothing that would appeal to anybody with brains beyond that of an addled boy over 15 (addled should be in italics). Almost every joke was about bodily functions (#1, #2, sex). While enduring it I kept thinking – maybe this is just a 40-years-down-the-road version of Blazing Saddles. The only thing correct about this thesis is ""down the road."" (My wife suggested we leave after about 45 minutes, but I said no. I figured we've already paid our $20 and what else would we do for the next 75 minutes. Almost anything would have been better.)At its crudest, Blazing Saddles (IMO, one of the greatest comedies, up there with Duck Soup) featured the campfire scene. *This* one featured Neil Patrick Harris crapping in his hat. Cum on the face? Let's hear it for There's Something about Mary. These things were outré, but funny because they were original. But once that's been done, that's been done. (Let's hear it for the terrific career of Sharon Stone after Basic Instinct.)The only chuckles involved cracks about Amada Seyfried's big eyes and a 15-second cameo by Bill Maher. One of the characters was so stupid as to make Cheech and Chong appear intelligent. (How desperate is Giovanni Ribisi?)MacFarlane obviously has a lot of clout to get major names like Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron to star in his movie. In their defense, as artists Neeson and Theron never know. How could this miss? By a mile. And MacFarlane can't act; he's a performer.Good point: Utah's Monument Valley backgrounds.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
384,facebook-138-591361,Family Guy gone west,5,21 June 2014,"A great cast with Ribisi, Silverman ,Neeson and Theron doing a fairly respectable job. If McFarlane was not actually in the film one would definitely notice his paws all over this with many of the gags and characters resembling Family Guy. Definitely a McFarlane film for McFarlane fans.The issue for me here though is McFarlane the actor. I can only imagine how much of an impact this film would have had if someone like Jeff Daniels played the lad. McFarlane is in nearly every scene and he becomes somewhat tedious. His timing for the joke lines is pretty impeccable (and there are a lot of joke lines) but he gives the impression he is going out of his way to not make an effort and its all too easy for him. I say keep the director McFarlane and ditch the acting.The film has its fair share of funny gags, many of them miss but enough make it to make this film enjoyable enough way to pass a couple of hours. Probably not for those looking for deep a meaningful films but if fart jokes make your day there are a couple of pretty funny ones here.

First of all, the dialogs are terrible, totally atemporal, it doesn't feel like they are in the past, it feels like some Americans traveled and are living in another country that they hate, the humor is terrible, so bad to the point they go to the universal laughing system: stupid fart, penis, gross sex jokes, sometimes all of these in the same phrase, in my opinion jokes for the people with less than 100 IQ.

386,johndavidwest20,Million Ways to Say Poop in Seth MacFarlane's Scatological West,2,15 August 2014,"Writer and director Seth MacFarlane (Ted, Family Guy) has taken scatological humor to repulsively infantile new lows with his comedy-Western, A Million Ways to Die in the West. Some might attempt to compare this effort to Mel Brooks's irreverent 1974 classic, Blazing Saddles, but that would be as unfair as comparing Porky's to The Searchers. MacFarlane proves that, as a screenwriter, he has about as much creativity as a hyperactive thirteen-year-old boy who just entered the hormonal battlefield of puberty and recently discovered the F-word.The story features MacFarlane as the film's protagonist, Albert Stark, a cowardly, talkative sheepherder (in the vein of Bob Hope's gutless characters), who is out of place in the dangerous 1882 Wild West (Arizona). He is soon dumped by his girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried); he later falls in love with an unlikely villainous gal, Anna, played by Charlize Theron. (It takes oxen-strength levels to suspend reality and believe that this clever, ethereal beauty could fall for MacFarlane. But, hey! Why not? Diane Keaton fell for Woody Allen in many of his films, and, of course, countless other squirrelly, comic, writer/directors have had many an unapproachably hot babe as their love interests). So Albert eventually proves that he's no longer a coward as he faces the Irish, gunslingin' Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) in a duel finale that does have a rather smartish surprise. Oops, did I give away too much? Not really. You can predict every plot point five scenes ahead, or before MacFarlane can distract you with a line about a prostitute returning from her date in time to ""do anal"" with a regular customer. . While this predictable story plays out, our thirteen- year-old boy throws in as many poop, fart, and diarrhea jokes as his juvenile mind can think of before inducing an E. coli outbreak. But he's not a one-trick pony. He coats on layers of—he he—sex jokes, lots of sex jokes (hand-over-mouth, ""Oh my God! No he didn't say that!"" sex jokes). Endless gags including a prostitute Ruth (Sarah Silverman) with a heart of gold and a ""huge vagina,"" and, of course sperm (both talking about it and showing it, recalling There's Something About Mary's hair gel scene. Yep, been there seen that). He then takes us back to some good, old, toilet humor with erect golden showering sheep (another hand-over-mouth ""Oh my God! No he didn't!""); he does steer clear of the obvious sheep jokes and rather gives us a retarded sheep! There are a few comic surprises that amuse, but not enough to redeem this film.Now, I don't have a problem with silly, irreverent, gross-out humor, but it's so much more enjoyable and less intellectually insulting when it is bathed in an element of wit. I don't necessarily need lofty Woody Allen literary cleverness in my comedies. But MacFarlane's potty humor represents a paucity of imagination. In using the word f-word and other four-letter words gratuitously in his depiction of the Western United States of 1882, he betrays his inability to express anger, distress, annoyance, and other strong emotional outbursts in his dialog. In fact, all of the film's dialogue feels out of place, too contemporary, and lacking any craft. I couldn't help but think that MacFarlane excessively uses ""f***, along with the other expletives, because he knows no other way of expressing extreme distress, anger, annoyance, or basic dialog that's interesting and or engaging. Well f*** him! Sorry, I'm extremely distressed. Clearly, I have no problem with the word. I think South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut is still one of the best musicals of the past twenty years; it's filled with the F-word, but it's also clever and carefully crafted. How could I possibly object to the F-bomb as one of my favorite directors, Martin Scorsese, drops bombs throughout his films? It's appropriate to his characters and to the diegesis of the respective films. But MacFarlane's disproportionate use of the word distracts from any substance that may exist in the dialog among the characters.One pleasant surprise in this western is Charlize Theron's performance—this woman can act. Despite an infantile acting partner, she's somehow able to transcend the inane material and produce an honest performance. Given the challenging task of crafting a sincere presence that relies on more than just her fantastically stunning face, Theron is able to rise well above all in this fecal folly. I am being unfair to Seth MacFarlane since he is not the sole writer of this movie; he shares that credit with two other writers, Alec Sulkin (Ted, Family Guy) and Wellesley Wild (Ted, Family Guy), so, clearly it took a village. If you remove all the sex jokes, eliminate the four-letter expletives, soften a few of the violent scenes, MacFarlane would have a funny(ish) thirty minute kids' show. Or, better yet, animate it, leave in the sexual innuendos and irreverent humor, and you'd have a quite funny twenty- two minute animated TV sitcom—Family Guy? If poop, sperm, and urine are what sells tickets these days, then this puerile movie is going to make a load of money.-John David West",A Million Ways to Die in the West

A poor story of a too nice, but poor shot sheep handler, that gets dumped by his girlfriend, only to find a new girl who ends up to be an outlaw bandits wife!!! The jokes weren't funny, the death scenes just seemed to make up screen time for what the story should've filled. I feel sorry for screen legends like Liam Neeson in this movie, who must have taken this movie on just for the money (tough times maybe?). Ewan McGregor even popped up for 5 seconds of cameo screen time, along with Christopher Lloyd, I mean 'Great Scott!'.The overall cinema experience was poor and I left there feeling a little deflated, un-joyous and well had to find another million ways to cheer me up, and find food!.

399,JordanRHanson,A Must-See for Lovers of Satire/Parodies,8,9 June 2014,"Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy, American Dad, The Cleveland Show) returns with his second motion picture: A Million Ways to Die in the West. Being that I am an avid fan of Family Guy, I was expecting to see a film containing similar jokes and satire that have kept me watching Family Guy for fifteen years. I was not disappointed.The film is a comedy/western set in Arizona in 1882. It stars Seth MacFarlane as well as Charlize Theron, Neil Patrick Harris, Amanda Seyfried, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, and Liam Neeson. I have seen other works with all of the main cast, so I thought it would be very interesting to see how their different acting backgrounds intertwined in a comedy/western. I thought each actor/actress played their respective roles to the greatest potential (given the type of raunchy humor this film has).I saw this movie one day after it was released, and I thought it was hilarious. However, upon reading critics reviews, it would appear that not many film professionals agree with me. I honestly don't know what these people were expecting... it's a self-aware western parody by Seth MacFarlane. This isn't an Oscar-hunting film that takes itself too seriously. Rather, it is poking fun at a genre that has served its purpose in cinema.When the western movie genre comes to mind, most people think of guns, horses, bandits, saloons, and the old frontier. Given that there isn't much left to make with this genre that hasn't already been done, Seth MacFarlane and others have decided to create a work of satire that exposes how depressing and death-filled the western genre truly is. When I heard the plot of this movie (as if the title didn't explain enough), I was so excited. The auditorium I was in had people of all ages, and they were all laughing throughout.Keep in mind that this is not high-brow comedy. The humor is raunchy, offensive, and slapstick... all of which I love. If you go see this film with an open mind and a raunchy sense of humor, I promise you will not be disappointed.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

So my recommendation is if you want to see a funny western go check out Quickdraw for free on hulu on your computer or if you have hulu plus you watch it on any device, that will give you your comedic western fix and you can forget all about this movie, plus Quickdraw isn't scripted it is improvised, they have a basic plot for the episodes but all the actors improvise the lines for the show.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Now first Id like to say I am a fan of MacFarlenes work: I liked Ted, American Dad and Family Guy(Although I've realized family guy has been going downhill) and when the trailer came out I was really excited to see it, but when I finally rented it on On Demand...yeah. The casting is good: MacFarlene is a very likable protagonist and I want to see him get the girl played by Charlize Thorton, who I think does great a job. I loved Neil Patrick Harris! I actually did get some laughs out of Sarah Silverman and Liam Neesons performance, but I didn't care for Amanda Seyfried or Giovanni Ribsis characters. They weren't unessential but they weren't interesting. The cameos were...interesting. I had a good laugh at the Doc Brown Cameo, I chuckled at MacFarlenes remark to the Gilbert Gottfried cameo,I thought Ryan Reynolds was... weird seeing as he had one camera shot before he was...shot, and I really didn't know what to make of the Django cameo.The jokes either hit it or they're annoying toilet jokes.

I like his quips, his best of this movie was when he quoted that this tragedy was 'just another way that God mysteriously shows that he loves us'. Genius wit.This movie was funny, but there was no real moments of laugh out loud (I as a man refuse to write 'LOL') comedy. Definitely some smiles and some snigger's but the biggest moments, such as the giant ice block splattering a man to death, was already shown in the trailer and it wasn't funny knowing what was coming. This is a problem the movie producers and directors need to work on for the future.The most memorable part of the movie was none of the humour, but the musical song 'moustache' which I guarantee will be stuck in your head days after watching the movie.The plot was simple, it moved along nicely there just wasn't many funny hysterical moments which I was expecting. Liam Neeson was as serious as he is in Taken and Sarah Silverman played her part with innocent humour.

404,mrhubbahubba00,Where are the jokes?,3,21 November 2015,"No one watches a movie like this because they are hoping for a creative, exciting storyline. It seems like most comedies of this style take the standard ""underdog realizes his potential and gets the girl"" approach and they usually don't even do it very well. And I think that can be okay - but the movie needs to have plenty of what viewers really came to see in the first place. The title and tone of this movie lead you to expect a lot of ridiculously over-the-top westerny deaths and the fact that it is a Seth MacFarlane movie makes you expect a lot of raunchy and childish humor. Sadly, it doesn't deliver enough of either. This is two hours of movie with fewer laughs than a 20 minute Family Guy episode. It almost feels like a trap - as if they created just enough material to put together a decent trailer and then spent the rest of the time enjoying the pretty scenery and joking with each other off camera about how much money they were going to make.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

All actors who have performed marvelously in previous movies/shows and you want to see them do more. Under the leadership of Seth MacFarlane, one of the people who has been able to produce quite some funny comedy and is a wonderful voice actor. The story about a young man who loses his girlfriend to a mustachioed'd gentleman and tries to win her back with the help of a beautiful lady, the wife of the greatest killer alive, and falls in love with her in the end with some action and lots of jokes, could be a wonderful little comedy, right?Wrong. It starts in the first scene with obscene and unfunny shadow jokes, continues with appalling sex, fart, penis, urine and excrement jokes, crowned by the well known laxative joke and sheep urinating in your face joke. Even the end is an attempt at being funny, I don;t mind the racism, it just went too far, that fails miserably. The wonderful, but spoiled, cameo of Back to the Future and Django Unchained, and the two songs, of which one is during the credits, were highlights in this movie. And to top it all off:They put a buttercup in Liam Neesons butt. They have one of the most brilliant actors alive, who by the way delivers the best performance of anyone in this ""comedy"" and what do they do with him? They stick a buttercup up his butt.

The whole movie is spiced with jokes which are, quite surprisingly, not those stereotypical and not-so-original jokes which are so common in movies these days. Also, the movie proves to be somewhat educational, since many little known historical facts have been implemented in the story. Without that, the storyline would probably be a little dull, and that is why I had to take two points off. There are also many references to older hit films, such as ""Back to the future"". Not to mention that the cast is amazing and the acting throughout the whole movie is outstanding. My personal opinion is that it deserves standing ovations.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
422,Rogueblue00,Good modern time comedy but not the best,8,30 July 2014,"Quick review:Enjoyed the movie and had a great time. There was no point in the movie where, I was shocked or surprised as Seth MacFarlane has a thing for jokes that may offend others from colour or religion as some may commonly know from his work, ""Family Guy"". But as fan of his work and watching his movie, I can say it was good but not the best. It could of been great if the writers had of put more thought into it as at times it was just relying on dumb immature jokes which I rarely saw in the movie but at same time, wasn't proud of.Full review:I was surprised seeing Seth MacFarlane in action and as a fan of his work, like Family Guy and Ted which I really enjoyed, it had me excited seeing his next piece of work in the spot light yet again. I understand this movie is not for everyone as in the movie there are plots where it may be like a gag and at times it was just silliness, but hey! As we all know it that's Seth MacFarlane humor, and to me if you enjoy his humor and the jokes he presents than you might especially enjoy this one. I for one did enjoy the movie and was surprised how he brought in modern time socializing into the wild west, which lol never in that way existed. There were parts in the movie where I felt like I was not bursting into laughter which had me worried on the movie at certain times. I did chuckle here and there but nothing major. It just felt too much like Family guy. I'm not sure if it's me that i'm seeing Peter Griffen or Seth MacFarlane true nature.As a fan of his work, especially Ted which had me excited all, I can say that I would defiantly pay to see another of his work, as I was not disappointed in any way, but..just not over the moon. Hopefully next time the writers could of put in more thoughts into the jokes. Seeing Seth MacFarlane and Charlize Theron together and just the two, I thought they did a good job. Without her I doubt, I would of enjoyed the movie, as she had the same sense of humor as he did in the movie, and without her, I cant see it possible for the movie.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

425,finn-holland_1993,Okay but not great,5,20 June 2014,"A Million Ways to Die in The West is Seth MacFarlane's second live action film after his earlier film, Ted. His humour has become part of the staple diet in the last decade or so of anyone who has regularly watched his shows Family Guy or American Dad. I still find it quite exiting to see Seth MacFarlane directing a film even though I myself have grown quite tired of his other shows.The first thing which is apparent is that anyone who is used to his brand of humour will feel quite at home with this film. What a comedy film relies on to the most part is of course it's jokes. They're in abundance and are usually funny, although that is not to say that there are some which actually aren't.The film covers most clichés in the book, and although this is in some ways part of the joke, it still runs for me slightly too close to the thing that it is mocking at the same time. What the outcome of this is that there are some parts of the film which just sort of run their course without too much wider impact. Something that it fails to do is completely set itself apart from the average comedy film. Whilst it is funnier than most, it doesn't ever feel groundbreaking. This is in part due to MacFarlane's humour being so present in the last ten years.This is not to say that his humour doesn't transfer well to live-action, because it does. There are some incredibly funny moments in this film, which can also be quite provocative – jokes relating to race, sex and damning violence. It is still a relief that he has not lost at least in the most part what has made him so successful and this is something which can be taken for granted.Seth MacFarlane's presence in the film is a tad too celebrified. His face has this soft light which makes him look almost wax-like. Although his character is lacking self belief and is left by his girlfriend, there is a sense that he is at the tipping point of being slightly too high up for own good. There is a moment in the film where he says ""I'm the one who laughs at the famous guy's shirt""; of course his jokes are aimed a lot at fame and money, but there is a hint of him losing his perspective slightly. He is arguably becoming too much of the joke. This style of self confidence comes off as slightly obnoxious at times.The desert setting is shot very nicely, with there being shots of glorious sunsets and dimly lit nights. It creates a backdrop which the rest of the film is able to comfortably work over.There are plenty Seth MacFarlane-style critics of society's way of life. For example, the medical procedures and fashion sensibilities of the time are made well-aware of. At no time does he want this story to trudge on without the audience being very well aware of the ludicrous lifestyle of the west, which of course takes place in many idealised depictions of the wild-west.The cameos are frequent, although some part of me was always wishing to see slightly more of some of the respective celebrities to make their space slightly more meaningful. Of course a cameo does not have to be meaningful at all and it makes it seem as though they had a lot of fun filming, but with such small parts for each they seem to break the film's rhythm without giving too much in return.This film is however, even with its flaws, an entertaining film which is worth watching. It makes good use of the 'wildness' in the west and uses it's drastically old-fashioned way of life to salvage a reasonably funny film. It comes off as slightly too sweetened and lacking any proper depth, but it is perhaps worth a watch if you are a fan of Seth MacFarlane's work.2.5/5 stars http://totellyouagain.blogspot.co.uk/",A Million Ways to Die in the West

It gets so lost in making all these gags work that there is no coherent flow to the story, not following a good movie format, bla bla bla. they only searching/fixating on how the movie presented, not searching for its entertainment.Comedy, in the contemporary meaning of the term, is any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or to amuse by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film and stand-up comedy. This sense of the term must be carefully distinguished from its academic one, namely the comic theatre, whose Western origins are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre can be simply described as a dramatic performance which pits two societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye famously depicted these two opposing sides as a ""Society of Youth"" and a ""Society of the Old"", but this dichotomy is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation. A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. Satire and political satire use ironic comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor. Satire is a type of comedy. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, using certain ironic changes to critique those forms from within . Screwball comedy derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising situations or characters. Black comedy is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or evil elements in human nature. Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

434,anton_heimerman,"Hardly ""Laugh-A-Minute""; rather, ""Titter-A-Scene""",5,31 May 2014,"Considering Seth MacFarlane's reputation for reinventing the 'Offensive Laugh Riot', as well as frequently paying tribute to well-known classics, we all expected the same thing: a send-up to Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles"". That comparison is now offensive to Mel, not Seth.The latest seasons of ""Family Guy"" hint that Seth's humor is fading, and he's more interested in production value and pretty imagery than the side-splitting humor we would expect. Unfortunately, the 'A-B' progression between the fantastically entertaining ""Ted"" and the sadly disappointing ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" prove this fading is true.Fans of Seth MacFarlane will like this one, though not nearly as much as ""Ted"", or even ""Family Guy"". I should also mention that I'm referring to his other work only because his style and humor are self-indulgent, and it rarely seems to stray beyond 'Signature Seth'. ""A Million Ways"" certainly has plenty to offer: a stellar cast; small handful of very funny parts; an oddly brilliant musical Square-Dance number about the glory of having a mustache; best of all, plenty of eye-popping visuals to offer, namely some of the most beautiful frontier nature shots I've ever seen. The single worst aspect of this okay-but-not-great flick is the fact that the trailer was as misleading as could be. A follow-up to ""Ted"" is no easy feat, and therefore, one thing is painfully obvious: the only way to get butts in the seats was to market the movie as a start- to-finish laugh riot. Take it from me, IT IS NOT! Every scene has more non-comedic storytelling than goofy situational humor, save a rather enjoyable ""acid trip"" sequence shown in the trailer. Take heed: it also offers plenty of crude, sexual, even scatological jokes that you'll find embarrassingly unfunny.""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is *probably* worth your time and money, *surely* worth checking out at a discount theater later on this summer, and *most definitely* worth a RedBox rental.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

I probably haven't laughed so much at a movie since ""Borat."" I loved the scenery, the bad jokes, the music, the cast, the witty dialogue ... everything.

Seth ought to do something else than acting in front of the camera. I think the movie would have been funnier if the actors wouldn't look so polished and clean.

I thought the movie Ted was pretty funny and I'm not a huge fan of Family Guy but I used to think it was one of the best shows on TV. Also I think Seth McFarlane is funny and was a great Oscars host who can be edgy but the trailer looked sort of stupid to me. So I had no idea going into the theatre if I would like this movie or not.Turns out I did not. The only even sort of funny scenes are all in the trailer. The premise wears thin very quickly and the jokes are pretty obvious and hacky. There's also lots of toilet humour etc but it never gets very funny or edgy even compared to other earlier movies like American Pie, Farrelly Brothers, etc. This movie was really disappointing in regard to how funny (or unfunny I should say) it was.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

If you enjoy family guy and Ted and that sort of humor you will enjoy this movie.it's the raw humor that shows the way people actually think, and not the boring FCC regulated humor in other shows and movies. It's this simple, if you enjoy this sort of comedy then you will love it. If you're not into the silly funny then, well I still think you'll love it because it's hilarious.

Yes, they could have made a cartoon about it but won't see Liam Neeson's acting. Neeson played a very good and convincing bad guy. Neil Patrick Harris also did a great job playing an a-hole. The movie may not be perfect but it had a storyline and good plot. MacFarlane played the leading man in a Western movie and I will give him credit for transitioning from animation creating and directing to putting himself as the main Western actor minus the Scottish/British accent. He has potential. I like his friends in the movie, the prostitute and her man. Charlize Theron is older but is still sexy in the movie. So, I don't know what some of these people are talking about unless they had not seen the movie, at all!

After all, we all know how stupid the viewing public is (Paris Hilton was popular for awhile, right?)"" Come on, comedy is only good when it's based on good observation and offers tidbits of truth in clever, fun doses. This wreck makes absolutely zero effort at uncovering any new perspective on the wild west other than to say that apparently toilet language and bowel movement obsession dominated society. There is nothing, repeat, nothing of interest in any of the plot lines or characters.

It isn't too much for him. He's a genius.Brilliantly observed and witty, he did his homework on what it was like in the Wild West and combined it with modern day language.

In my opinion, this was not a film that made me ""die of laughter"", but it did make me laugh for it does contain some outrageous moments. With a guy like Seth MacFarlane behind the film, you know that the comedy has to be done well. The setting is something that I rarely enjoy in films, the wild west. But this comedy made me enjoy the west a lot more than I normally would have. Though it is not a serious western, it captured the elements quite well. I give props to the writers for being able to create an entertaining comedy in the west rather than making it take place in the 21st century. Overall, the film has an awesome cast that presents comedy very well, but obviously it is hard to create a 10/10 comedy and A Million Ways to Die in the West is that.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Simple as that.I signed up here JUST to review this movie.I agree with Seth seeming out of place in front of the camera. It's because he is very popular for being behind the camera. We know the voice ,but we're not used to seeing the face.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and have gone back a few times to see it again. There are several parts that were just too dumb for me, but overall i loved it. I have several women friends who loved it too, which absolutely shocked me because this type of movie is generally not liked by women.

At first glance, a pop culture enthusiast may think ""what an original idea for a pothead movie"", they are indeed wrong to assume such pretentiousness. The film is superb in the historical references of that era. The main character, played by macfarlane, is charming beyond belief. The enjoyment I receive from watching his many facial expressions was indescribable. His voice almost made me pregnant. Assuming many women have become pregnant just by the sound of his name. There are other characters in the film whose story lines were excellent , but macfarlane won my vote over Brad Pitt in every way. On another note, this film is and has the same wonderful and priceless standards of the Monty Python franchise. Except for the leading man, who could resemble a young Brando, honestly I did not focus on even his horse or the famous actress who won him over.

He simply gets crushed to death by a bull. Why? Why does this bull run him over? And the guy who gets crashed by the ice. They just die to tell the people, hey, sb. died, thats funny.

Story was OK, but i especially liked the way of filming, the humour and the dryness of it... The actors were chosen right and i liked Liam Neeson playing a bad guy and of course Barney Stinson's 19th century version. This calls for a sequel in a different age. Maybe with the same actors.

Not a waste of money at all, you'll enjoy it.This movie doesn't take itself seriously at all. The most engaging part is the way that it presents the 'real' wild west from the same perspective as if a modern person had travelled back into the past. There are many good observations that stand up under their own steam and are a good laugh at the same time. Particularly engaging is the implicit invitation from the film's writers to count how many gruesome and often hilarious ways one could randomly and tragically die in the wild west. I also greatly enjoyed the side-swipe at how lethal the doctors of the time could be. Liam Neeson also plays a good role as the no-good husband of the heroine.Not a laugh a minute, but I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times. Enjoy.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

A few NEAR-laughs are buried beneath ""sentimental"" moments between Seth and devastatingly gorgeous Charlize Theron; long, long dragged out scenes that look like they're badly improvised, like padding for a narrative that doesn't know where it wants to go. Never have characters sit there giggling at their own jokes if you want an audience to break up! Key rule in comedy. Comedy is schadenfreude! We need to have someone else's misfortunes to laugh at, or it just isn't going to be funny! The viewers see the humor in the situation that the characters don't. Any movie that misses this rule just isn't going to be funny. Don't have the characters themselves provide the laugh track. That's OUR job!

I ""get"" what Seth MacFarlane does. With that said, let's break it down.Seth MacFarlane can't act. He can do the voice work for animated characters, but put him on the screen, as a live, human being, and he falls flat. He didn't make the character spark or relate. His acting was about as two-dimensional as the characters in his animated series.The script was poorly written and the jokes were not that funny. Maybe if you were still in high school or junior high a steady stream of d*** jokes, fart jokes, and other elements of bathroom humor might make for a dandy picture. I had thought that MacFarlane could aim higher and deliver better: maybe that opinion was incorrect.The supporting cast of actors--for the most part--did an admirable job. However, they could not overcome the limits of MacFarlane's on screen performance or the poor quality of the script they had to work with.I'm glad I caught this dog at an afternoon showing and didn't have to pay full price.

Everything you see on the television ads are literally the funniest parts of the movie. I think I chuckled, not laughed, out loud maybe 6 or 7 times.

It's like he's just reciting some lines without even putting an effort into it.Don't get me wrong I like his creations, the cartoons that is.

We pretty much laughed till our guts hurt as did many others in the theater.Don't go if you're offended by ""potty"" humor or the like.Movie set is very authentic looking but Macfarlane's and Theron's characters speak as if in present day while essentially doing a commentary on the risks of the West in the 1800s. It just works. If they had attempted that in ""authentic"" Western vernacular, it would not have been nearly as funny.There were a couple of dud jokes in there in my opinion, but most of it was downright hilarious as they compared 19th century Western life from today's point of view.This was an 8 on the IMDb scale, but definitely a 9 on the Stooges Scale . :)",A Million Ways to Die in the West
474,LesterFester,Stay Home,1,6 June 2014,The only thing worse than a bad sequel to Mel Brooks's BLAZING SADDLES is You guessed correctly This movie. The adult sexual humor was so sophomoric that I'm sure only those under 12 thought it was funny. The sad thing is not only was it not funny the first time they chose to do it again and again in different ways.The only possible entertaining feature of the film was the dance sequence. But the choreography was clearly borrowed from SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.If you look at the credits there were many talented actors I just wish they'd had been in the movie.My advice STAY HOME!,A Million Ways to Die in the West

Albert's (played by Seth MacFarlane) rants in the first 30 minutes of the movie were not funny, as he so desperately tried to make them. If this movie didn't have an R rating, all the farts and toilet humor would be hilarious to a 12 year old but they wore really thin after the first 2 or 3 attempts. Overall, the cast was great and I love cameos from stars you wouldn't expect to see, but this movie could have been A LOT better. When Albert gets high on peyote with the Indians, that's when the movie totally goes off the rails.

The characters were consistently interesting and well cast, the plot was fresh and entertaining, and the writing was just brilliant. I loved the subtle jokes and the cameos, and Seth MacFarlane was exceptional as the lead. He plays the leading man without any arrogance or cliché' swagger; instead, he comes off as genuine and easy to relate to. I really like that. There are few films in which I laugh continuously from start to finish. This is one of those. It never got dull or repetitive, never felt forced, and was not at all predictable.

However, I could barely sit through the entirety of AMWTDITW without nearly nodding off or wanting to leave the theater completely. The humor (if you can even call it that) was scarce. It was noticeably forced and obscenely crude, which is nothing new for Seth, but it was crude in a very childish way. Much of it had something to do with farting or diarrhea, not an adult topic in my opinion. The storyline was unoriginal, boring, and predictable. The characters were stereotypical and flat and the acting was poor at best. Seth is far better suited for voice acting than live action. It was painful to watch. *SPOILER* The scene that tipped its hat to the back to the future series would have been a fun surprise had it not been ruined in the previews.

But in the end, even with its handful of HILARIOUS moments, it ended up not meeting my expectations. All the really funny scenes were the scenes that were already in the trailers, so maybe that was the reason I didn't laugh that much, considering I had seen all the trailers beforehand. But in the end, I personally think that a movie listed under the comedy genre should be much more than a handful of good quality jokes spread throughout a huge sea of overused toilet humour used as filler. Maybe if I hadn't seen all the ""good jokes"" in the trailers already , I would have enjoyed the movie more; but again that doesn't change the fact that this movie SHOULD have had more material than just those.

Despite the film's lack of realism, it is still a greatly funny film which really reinforces the comedy aspects. Maybe not as well written as Macfarlen's other film Ted, but just as funny. Therefore I give it a 7/10.

The lead male is portrayed by Seth Macfarlane as you may have guessed who is nothing special in outside of voice acting which is where he belongs. The humour in the film seemed more or less the same as the stuff found in Family guy. This is fine however it doesn't really hold the movie and is not worth your 11 dollars depending on what country your from or if you are a pirate. A Million Ways to die in the West or AMWTDITW for short is definitely not a stand out comedy for 2014 and will likely be surpassed in terms of popularity and grossing by films like Bad Neighbours and 22 Jump street.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

And it wasn't because I was completely in love with his last movie Ted. Ted honestly was disappointing because everyone talked about how much they loved it and to me it fell flat. It was entertaining, but it fell flat. However, I'm a fan of Seth regardless and this movie looked cute. That being said, ""ways"" goes right where ""Ted"" went wrong, for two reasons.1. It has one heck of a plot. It's simple, like the old west, and that's what makes it delightful. Seth did a great job of keeping all the jokes appropriate to the era, and if you aren't being cynical of it, you'll appreciate how much effort he put into designing this movie. The plot has an understandable conflict, and it ends satisfactory. but it's not just slapstick humor. There is some actual acting going on here people, and you do feel something for the characters. It's not just mumbo jumbo laugh at this laugh at that. He sets you up, and takes you for a comedy ride that has you laughing naturally at the cleverness. 2. Charlize Theron and Seth have some chemistry!!! Trust me when I say that a talented actress like Charlize wouldn't sign on to do this movie if she didn't see something in it. She shines. Seth shines. All the actors do great at just having a good time. And it makes you wonder why charming (and somewhat good looking ) Seth isn't in front of the camera more.All in all, this movie was fun.

About every cliché contained in Old Western television series and movies was blown apart. The premise that the Old West was a very dangerous place, and not as romanticized in fiction, is entirely correct. Much of the audience being too young would not have appreciated the opening faux-Technicolor shots of Monument Valley, the backdrop for many Westerns, including the John Wayne classic, Stagecoach. There were references to Blazing Saddles, which were appropriate as that movie is probably better remembered that the movies it lampooned. The Native American chief was called ""Cochise"", a perennial name for the chief in many movies. Perhaps the writers were just recognizing one of many stereotypes. I have awarded Nine Stars. Seven stars for the many belly laughs, with two stars added for sound research to achieve historical accuracy.

I see this as an update of Blazing Saddles reflecting the way humor has changed over that period of time. McFarlane's least talent is as an actor but that was offset by Charlize Theron who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying herself and I was enjoying her too. Liam Neeson was effective and suitable scary as Clinch. The rest of the cast was solid but not asked to do much. Production values were high with some good outdoor photography.

The difference is that here it's ""for real"" but the more hilarious for it!A whole lot of guest stars make for a fun time and add a special wink to this film as well as give it a certain credibility in terms of how worthwhile it can be.(Don't blink or you may miss some!)Go watch this now on the big screen, don't wait for the uncensored BluRay version.

I wish I could say the movie exceeded my low expectations, but it was worse than anticipated. A couple laughs, but far too much mind-numbing nonsense in between. Seth MacFarlane sought laughs by using modern-day references in the Old West, abundant genitalia references, and potty jokes, all punctuated with f- bombs aplenty. These devices have been used so much, they are now cheap groans. The problem with being edgy is that you constantly need to go further out. MacFarlane took gross-out over the edge, especially for diarrhea absurdities. I suppose the movie is meant to be a parody of traditional Westerns, but the film uses so many anti-Western clichés that it ends up being a parody of itself. A Million Ways to Die in the West comes across as dull and repetitive. Movie making is a collaborative art form. The tagline for this movie is ""From the guy who brought you Ted."" The singular noun is purposeful. Seth MacFarlane produced, wrote, directed, and starred in this farce. I believe a major theme of the movie was how everyone needs a helping hand on occasion. MacFarlane would be wise to seek help on his next film. When he works collaboratively, he's done some good stuff.The big question was why this movie was ever made. In McFarlane's script, the character played by McFarlane constantly says that he hates the West. It sounded like serious damnation, not witty self- deprecation. Did McFarlane see the Western rearing its ugly head and feel compelled to knock it back down again. When Mel Brooks made Blazing Saddles, he was having fun with a tired genre. A Million Ways to Die in the West comes across as ridicule, not comedy.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
509,dorgan662,A million ways to kill an idea.,2,4 June 2014,"This film was seriously disappointing for any fan of fuzzy door productions and Seth Macfarlane himself. The film was riddled with continuity errors, boring/ sometimes obvious jokes and bad acting. All of which were provided by Seth Macfarlane himself. This title is something to miss if you have a lot of respect for Macfarlane as I have. Unfortunately it seems his career in voice acting in no way constitutes towards his screen performance. Hopefully the next big blockbuster he puts out into the world will provide fresh jokes and actors that are new to the whole industry that is toilet humor, as the return of Giovanni Ribisi unfortunately did very little to improve the performance or entertainment level of what could have been a great film.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

I love Family Guy and American Dad (Cleveland show has its moments too!) Ted was also a great film in my opinion so I hoped this one would live up to my expectations and it did not disappoint. I feel it got a low ranking mainly from people who don't understand the sarcastic humour that was obviously apparent throughout. I thought the film was incredibly witty, extremely funny with constant laugh out loud moments and it also had a decent plot with some great acting from Seth himself (who would have known he was just as great in front of the camera?) The great cast showcases to me that people could see great potential in the script and all actors involved really held their own in making this film a brilliant comedy.

While I was laughing out loud at moments, it was probably the same amount of laughter (or less) that a typical Family Guy episode produces. The raunchy parts are somewhat funny, but it's all too over-done and not funny, mostly. The story of the movie itself is garbage and more than predictable once it's actually revealed; until then you spend about 20 minutes or so wondering ""what the hell am I watching??"". Do yourself a favor and rip this movie, don't use your hard earned money, but still see the humor included in this - you'll think of MacFarlane differently and appreciate Family Guy MUCH MORE.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Needless to say I was beyond disappointed with this film. It was suppose to be a comedy and I didn't even laugh once! The jokes were either too filthy or too corny. Some of them even I found offensive. All the ""jokes"" were in the trailers, so by the time you went to see the movies you were tired of hearing them. I don't know how he got the actors he did to play in this movie. Maybe just a favor to a friend or something. Save your money and skip this movie. Better luck next time Seth.

Both were crazy first attempts of Seth MacFarlane which have great critically and commercial success. This must be a pattern with Seth because just like when American Dad! came out, it is good but it's no Family Guy just like this movie is no Ted. That being said, I believe this movie was the best Wild West movie I have ever seen, mainly because it is not my genre of movie. The humor in the movie was good and you know it was written by Seth and his crew. I think the main reason this movie did not have the commercial success of Ted is mainly because Seth cast himself as the lead and not another A list actor. In conclusion I think it is a great movie for having a comedy Wild West movie. I just hope Ted 2 is a little better..",A Million Ways to Die in the West

Combine these actors with ""Family Guy""'s creator, Seth MacFarlane, and call it a comedy movie and you are sure to experience disaster and boredom.

However after having watched this film i was delighted! the sets were excellent, the jokes were punchy, the score was fabulous and the cast was very top shelf.I loved the evolution of MacFarlane's character from one of a timid disposition, to the gun slinging westerner he is at the end of the film - however still with his heart in the right place.I thought the jokes delivered by the cast were well timed, and just that brand of comedy that you shouldn't really laugh at, but you do anyway. My only complaint being that at times there was perhaps a little too much 'potty humor' for my liking (poo jokes etc) but other than that i thought the comedy was well placed.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it was a heartwarming comedy set in an era that we haven't seen televised for a while.

My first impression of the trailer for this movie is that it would be more stupid than funny and slapstick/toilet humor isn't my idea of funny (most of the time). The only reason I watched it is because there was literally nothing else I hadn't seen at the time.Fortunately, McFarlane's humor in this movie is actually witty for the most part- even the slapstick type stuff was funny. It's obviously not a serious movie so I don't really understand the point in trying to review it as such. If you like humor of any fashion I recommend giving it a watch- I was glad I did.

It was almost like trying to watch him perform stand-up, in a movie setting. It stunk up the whole house!Thank God Walburgh didn't get in this one, he's probably glad he stayed away from this bomb.

525,chillthrill,Brutally honest movie review,6,6 October 2014,"Got a highly medicated before snuggling up in bed to watch the Seth MacFarlane comedy script with my girlfriend. Opening thoughts were that the setting and plot almost have nothing to do with each other. The story takes place in the wild wild west and the awkward conversations are too modern for the setting or plot. Many of the comedy bits are forced. This coupled with Macfarlane amateur visual acting made me think that he should stick to voice-overs.Bottom-line: This movie would have been more appropriate as a animated piece with the long cast of celebrity voice-overs. Needless to say, about 45 minutes into the movie me and my partner stopped paying attention and had the most amazing intercourse we've had in weeks. Therefor, depending on your definition of ""success""... Movie night was a success 10/10, but i only got half way through the film so that gets 4/10. Overall rating 6/10.Better luck next time Seth, But thanks.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
526,pococksmith,"A million ways to die, and it did .....",1,12 October 2014,"Seth Macfarlane first came to my attention as the past host of one of the Oscar shows and I thought he was very good. I'd also seen him recently along with Charlize Theron on the 'Graham Norton' show talking about making this film and having Tom Cruise in fits of laughter. So knowing that Miss Theron is an excellent actress and you couldn't go far wrong with Liam Neeson I recently bought this film and we settled down to watch it. Do you ever get into the first say ten, or fifteen, minutes of a film and think ""Oh God, this is awful, or is it me?"" I thought the horses and extras looked a damn sight more comfortable appearing on screen than the lead actor did. I'm no prude but the amount of breaking-wind jokes became so boring, crude, then tiresome, and the machine gun gags, many more miss than hit, well ... what a waste of my money, what a waste of all those other talented cast members and what a waste of film stock. I'm afraid his other efforts 'Ted' and 'Family Guy' are not for me, but everyone each to their own but from now on I won't be purchasing anymore DVD's by this guy. This movie's title is spot on, it really did die a million ways according to the myriad poor reviews this film has had. I hope the other two leads were paid well because this wouldn't have been a great help on their film CV's! Maybe it also didn't help that Mr Macfarlane had written, produced, directed as well as starred in the film - all those different hats he wore may well have exhausted his perspective. Lastly, my DVD is going to the charity shop, hopefully somebody else out there might enjoy it for a third of the cost I paid for it.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

After watching the trailer, I felt compelled. I laughed. I was entertained. Amanda was a bit flat, but the rest top shelf actors obviously enjoyed themselves and delivered decent performances. To be honest, I really tried not to laugh and was prepared to pan this film.

Why do they have to make of of religion in that movie? That is disrespectful and I couldn't trust my own ears when I hears that.

I was hoping it would be more like Ted than Family Guy and was happy to find it was. Like Ted, it starts off slow with a lot of Family-Guy-esque gags, even in one case using one of Family Guys' signature flashbacks. After watching the first 15 minutes or so I was afraid my wife wasn't going to enjoy the movie, but then the story actually started going, and you actually started to get to know, and like, Seth's character Albert. Another reviewer stated that Albert acts like he's in a skit for a lot of the time, and states it as if it's a bad thing, but that's really part of the comedic element of this film. Rather than just being a comedy based in the old west, Albert acts as if he has a modern, outside perspective of life in an old frontier town, and even makes some references to things that did not exist back then.

Can't believe all the negative reviews.Good comedy is lost on those without some degree of intelligence. Good comedy is subtle and does not appeal to all.

It's Seth MacFarlane people, and he has his own way of humor. Some find it disrespectful and inappropriate, and others find it simply hilarious and genius. Unfortunately I belong to the latter group. Not really into family guy but I love American dad and Ted. The moment before I went into the cinema, I expected the movie to give me a huge amount of laughter and to be a fun movie to watch at. And it damn well did. It's full of mature jokes, and dark humor accompanied with what I think a decent plot. And lets not forget the wild western theme, you don't get western themed movies often nowadaysThere's a ton of added extras like some famous actors playing little roles. And too some references to other movies which is nice. The movie itself wont win any awards, which I also think isn't what Seth is trying to do. But it sure delivered one of many goals of any comedy movies, to make viewers laugh and have a good time. It's also worth noting that the movie's target audience are likely more for young to middle aged people who are more open minded and not too sensitive with offensive jokes. Though, if you don't like Seth's humor don't even think about giving it a try. I'm not too harsh on the other aspects of the movie because it's just a comedy which I don't really give attention to all the details. So my review is in contrast to mostly other reviews.

I mean, it's just such an awesome contemporary take on the Western and I feel like Seth MacFarlane was able to take what's great about Family Guy, dial it down a notch and very effectively create a very self-aware, self- parodying flick, that's also oddly thought-provoking and highly relevant to our times.The character development could have been better as a lot of the supporting characters were just there for comic relief... which makes sense, because as Seth MacFarlane said, it's meant to be a comedy, but also a Western.With that said, between Neil Patrick Harris's character and Seth MacFarlane's, it almost felt like an episode of How I Met Your Mother meets Family Guy so I'm definitely biased, because I loved both those shows.I could go on and on about all I loved in this movie, but I don't want you to read my opinion - I want you to watch it and a definite standout was Neil Patrick Harris'sEven if you watch it and you're viscerally offended... you have to respect Seth MacFarlane for taking bold risks and fully putting his humor out there.

You know, I just realized that last joke might not have been clear. I didn't mean that she has a hairy pussy. I meant that Foy has a mustache, so, you know, he gets hair in her when he goes down there."" However if the crudeness can somehow be separated and you can somehow block it out of the movie it could be salvageable, since the movie had its redeeming moments. A slapstick comedy although sick, disgusting and moronic in quality during those tiny not-frequent intervals that ruin the movie. Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson are wasted in this lousy script.",A Million Ways to Die in the West

545,blenusmartin,Second best comedy western ever,10,27 January 2020,"If you like good comedy, guns, the west and pretty ladies shooting guns, this is the movie to watch. You have to watch through the very end. I give it a 10.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
546,jamie_g-07307,I don't get the hate,8,26 March 2018,I do t understand why so many people hates this flick. I laughed my ass off and still do even after multiple watches. I think you need to know what to expect going into it. It's similar to a family guy episode. Short quick witted jokes that either land or don't but they move along quickly so it's no big deal. The story get a bit convoluted in the back end of the movie but in true Seth fashion it doesn't matter.Make your own decision in this one and give it a crack,A Million Ways to Die in the West
547,lukestevenbaker,Light hearted fun,9,28 December 2020,"Thoroughly enjoyed this, light hearted and not to be taken seriously.
The best humour when we poke fun at ourselves. Some great cameo roles and lots of real belly laughs. Been a while since I had those from watching a film :)",A Million Ways to Die in the West
548,camillawebster,Thanks Seth!,10,8 January 2019,We had a fantastic evening watching this and having a laugh. Thanks Seth!,A Million Ways to Die in the West
549,castlepsaint-74051,Loved it really funny movie,8,4 August 2018,Cant believe this only got 6.1 as it is one of the funniest films I have seen in a long while. Maybe it just worked with my sense of humour.,A Million Ways to Die in the West
550,kcolop,"Mindless, enjoyable entertainment",8,8 August 2017,"I'd watch the reading of an obituary if Charlize Theron was in it, but in spite of that, I found myself entertained by the unsophisticated humor and the good performances from some really good actors. This absolutely isn't a thinker-kinda movie, but it is easy to watch and doesn't make you feel cheated by paying the steep price of admission. Appreciate it for its simple entertainment value.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
551,jerryammel,A Million Ways to Laugh Insane in the West,9,13 August 2017,"I liked this movie for the simply executed raw humor. The acting was great and the story line kept you interested providing a somewhat predictable outcome, but you just could be sure. The overall production was very cinematographic with lots of great camera angles. The core to the humor in this movie it the farcicalness of it all. Overemphasizing how the old west was such a wasteland of bad-ass people and harshness. The comedy is beautiful 5th grader to young adult, brash, raw, lots of one liners (I'm 57). Very MacFarlane-ish with old school 60's Batman slapschtick fight scenes. This movie is not for the stuck-ups and people that like to overthink their movies. This movie will become a cult classic.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
552,chaboum,"Incohesive, uncomic",2,5 September 2020,"A failed attempt at layering a modern comedy on a western scene. The use of excessive profanity to mask an uncomic script is evident.There is a blatant attack on religion and in particular Christianity in this movie, perhaps McFarlane is passing atheist beliefs is this script.Mcfarlane's Kent accent stinks out like a sore thumb in a western and accentuates the erroneous layering.All in all the comedy is sub-par and more is not better.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
553,jwood-28,"Poorly Acted, Poorly Written, Not Very Funny",1,12 June 2014,"I want to start by saying that I am easily entertained and usually am a Seth Macfarland fan but he can not act! This was one of the worst movies I have seen in years. I kept thinking you are no Mel Brooks and you are no Gene Wilder. My wife and I went with another couple and we saw the film for free and it still was horrible. it seemed like they took a little ""Family Guy"" humor, their take on ""Blazing Saddles"", and threw in parts of Sarah Silverman's act and mix them all up with modern references and some off color humor and you have the film I saw tonight. it was a waste of time and left me stunned in disappointment! I thought Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson were fine with a lousy script and a cameo by an actor from a classic comedy was excellent but not much else worked for me. Neil Patrick Harris and Amanda Siegfried were surprisingly horrid. I so wish it had been better!",A Million Ways to Die in the West
554,Nomad_85,21st Century Hollywood 'comedy' by the numbers,1,15 June 2014,"Let's see if I've found all the cornerstones of today's Hollywood 'comedy' here:Weak, hopeless, pathetic male lead. Puts women on a pedestal.Weak, hopeless, pathetic 'comic relief' male sidekick. Puts women on a pedestal. 'Strong and independent woman' to baby the male lead into 'being confident'. Falls in love out of pity. Borderline liar but no matter because she cares so much! Another 'Strong and independent woman' who is mean because women should just be nasty and strong and independent right? And she must have a catfight with the female lead. ""bitch!"" Groundbreaking!Fart and poopy jokes. oh my, classic! Penis and vagina jokes. rofl. double laughs for animal ones! the more graphic the better.Women being violent against men (this one is a Hollywood favourite).Extras dying horribly. omfg so funny!!!!11Racial stereotypes. Black men love women's bums! Chinese people have small eyes! get it?!?!Such a shame. The plot idea - a parody of the western - could have been funny. I would suggest the script itself had been written by 5-year-olds, but the stereotypical characters are a giveaway.Seth MacFarlane (his character and his movie) is about as funny as his fart jokes.Liam Neeson, as the bad guy, is horribly out of place. Maybe he was in shock about what he had got himself into here? Must have done this one purely for the money.Neil Patrick Harris plays the character he's played a hundred times before. One or two amusing quips. That's about it.Unfortunate that I got dragged along to see this tripe. I suggest you avoid this if possible.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
555,andrealazzarotti,Another piece of shame in the cinema,1,30 November 2019,"This is not comic....volgarity its not comic, the only way this movie try to entertain the public its with farts, volgarity, and explicity sexual sad irony....its ok for 5 minuts..but then become very annyoing",A Million Ways to Die in the West
556,kekkie-1,Ahead of its time... some spoilers.,8,27 October 2014,"Seth is, as always, a genius. This is a sharp comedy, but it's probably too smart for its own good. But just like Family Guy in its first two years; this movie is way ahead of its time. I suggest it will become a cult classic. I've never seen popular culture infiltrate the Wild West in this way - it's a good way! Seth really has an amazing following of good solid actors. Giovanni Ribisi and Neil Patrick Harris are perfectly cast and Sarah Silverman is outrageously spot on. I also really liked Amanda Seyfried, she's always dedicated to her character. Some of the lines are brilliant, don't horse and drink is just fabulous and I loved the silly dance scene. Bill Maher's stand-up scene is hard to beat. Seth continues to develop as an actor with time but I must admit, I would have loved to have seen Jim Carrey as the farmer. Grab the DVD and just relax and enjoy some really smart humour.",A Million Ways to Die in the West
