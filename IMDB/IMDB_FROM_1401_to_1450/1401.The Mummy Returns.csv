0,TheLittleSongbird,"More of the same adventure sequel, but it actually works.",7,8 September 2009,"Both the original and this are great fun and completely likable. Of course the sequel does have flaws, the plot isn't quite as strong as the one in the original, the scorpion king was a bit of a disappointment(he could've been designed better) and again like the original it is overlong. But it does have a sense of unpretentious fun, and that is great to see. The visuals are very impressive, and the music score, this time by Alan Silvestri is very effective, though I do prefer the Goldsmith. Although he isn't given as much to do, Arnold Vosloo still impresses as Imhotep, who I admit I did find scary in the original, not so much here, but Vosloo's performance is great. The other performances are fine too, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are both charming in the lead roles, and Patricia Velasquez is just beautiful beyond words as Meela Nais/Arnk Su Namun. Plus Freddie Boath is perfectly tolerable as Alexander, and John Hannah is fine too, same with Allun Armstrong of all people. All in all, a fun sequel, that shows that more of the same can actually work. The only other sequel that I have seen that is more of the same yet lives up exactly to the standard of its original is Home Alone 2:Lost in New York. 7/10 for Mummy Returns.

1,Leofwine_draca,"Awful acting and rubbish CGI, but it's still an improvement over the first",5,30 August 2016,"I wasn't a major fan of the first MUMMY film so it took me six years to finally bother watching this sequel – when I happened to catch it on television. In all respects it's a direct continuation of the first in the series, with the viewpoint of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". THE MUMMY made a whole heap of cash at the box office, so the big wigs ordered more of the same, and what we get is THE MUMMY RETURNS. Loud, brash, and resolutely dumb, this is a film that requires you to leave your brain outside the door before sitting down to watch. It's packed with preposterous special effects and some awful acting, but despite these things, I couldn't help but enjoy it a little. It's certainly more fun than the first film, as everything's settled down a little and there are no hopes waiting to be dashed. Despite the overlong running time, THE MUMMY RETURNS provides adequate entertainment for those in a forgiving mood.I won't talk about the plot – suffice to say the action shifts from Egypt to London and then finally back to Egypt again. It's all wonderfully stupid, and the script is a real clunker this time around. Unfortunately the film-makers decided to put a kid into the proceedings, and Freddie Boath plays an irritating public school brat of a boy; you'll be praying for him to get his head lopped off or at the very least lose an arm during the proceedings, but to no avail. Fraser and Weisz return as the hero and heroine; Fraser is typically wooden, while Weisz gives another absolutely appalling performance; how is this woman still getting acting jobs? Far better is John Hannah, whose comic relief role is reduced here, and the returning Arnold Vosloo seems a lot more comfortable with his central role. Heads up to The Rock, who impresses despite only having five minutes of screen time, and Patricia Velasquez, who seems to be trying to rival Weisz in terms of bad acting but who really looks the part – especially those eyes! Other characters I liked were Izzy, the black pilot; the black bodyguard, who whups major backside, and Alun Armstrong, who seems a little lost here, a world away from his usual films.This being an action-adventure, you'd better pray there's plenty of action to be had, and the good news is that there most definitely is. Whether it's mummies chasing a double decker bus through the streets of London, Arabs and Westerners duking it out in displays of swordsmanship, or deadly pygmies lurking in the bush, the fight scenes come thick and fast and once again, they're heavy on the special effects. As for those FX, they're a mixed bunch, ranging from passable but seeming to deteriorate as the film progresses. By the time the completely-CGI Scorpion King shows up at the film's climax, they're hopelessly messy and quite appalling, and the cartoonish pygmies are also a disappointment. But never mind that – THE MUMMY RETURNS improves on the first film, and that's a definite good thing. Just don't go in expecting too much.",The Mummy Returns
2,SnoopyStyle,Good swashbuckling fun in confusing story,6,7 December 2013,"The team of Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) have increase by one with the addition of their son Alex (Freddie Boath). Together, they are treasure hunting and finds the Bracelet of Anubis. In ancient times, the Scorpion King used it to command the Army of Anubis. Now everybody is on a quest to stop the coming of the apocalyptic rising of the army of Anubis.The story is complicated and confusing. There is a lot of backstory to learn. The 15 minute prequel of The Rock as the Scorpion King didn't help any. It's more of an ad for the Scorpion King franchise. At least, it's easy to identify the good guys from the bad guys. So even if you don't understand what's happening, you know who to root for. The CGI and the swashbuckling makes up for some of the confusion.",The Mummy Returns
3,Hitchcoc,More of the Same but OK,6,19 September 2001,"There are times when the cynical part of me gets put aside and I go to a movie to just see what happens. I decided that this time I would enjoy the special effects, the rules dreamed up by the Mummy experts, none of them ancient Egyptians, and just watch. There is really no plot, at least none of any importance. It is a series of events with some loose kind of contrived hierarchy of evil that needs to be addressed. It is pure video game stuff. Still, I watched it, admiring the incredible images put on the screen. The rapidity of motion. The critters that kept coming and coming. I looked at this like I look at a photograph and said, ""The people that did this are pretty darned creative."" Wouldn't it be nice if there was a bit of suspense and anticipation. We all know that you-know-who is going to meet you-know-who and according to the talk about the sequel, we know who's coming next. Anyway, I'm not going to put it down but I'm also not going to bother to watch it again.",The Mummy Returns
4,mark.waltz,"Was one enough? Probably, but this is still worth your time.",6,7 July 2020,"OK, since I've already watched ""The Mummy"", I might as well carry on with its sequel, especially since much of the main cast (lead by Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) have returned, and the first one was so much fun. How bad can it be? Well, bad is in the eye of the beholder, and this is extremely enjoyable for what it is in spite of the fact that like most fantasy action films of the past 20 years, it can be just TOO much. Even though this came out before the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, it has some of the elements that made later entries in that series far too complicated even with its simplicity. Convoluted, often confusing, mainly because there's far too much going on, far too many characters, far too much action to get in one sitting, and with hundreds of thousands of movies to watch, who wants to go back and see something again that they didn't get the first time. OK, me, but that's when I need a break from fresh celluloid.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson dominates the first reel of this film as the Scorpion King, an Egyptian warrior who, while on the verge of death, offered himself up to one of the Gods of darkness in exchange for more time to conquer his enemies. That he gets, with the sudden appearance of a tropical paradise in the middle of the desert, and then he's off to battle with the aide of demonic looking monsters aiding him. But when his time is up, it's up, and he's pulled away to fulfill his promise. Centuries go by, and the scorpion bracelet ends up on the arm of Fraser and Weisz's son, and that could open up a great big can of flesh eating beetles and once again destroy the world. The only way to conquer the Scorpion King is to bring back Imhotep, last seen being pulled into the muck after his eternity was pulled out by mysterious beings on a white chariot.This probably plays better on a digital TV than it did in the theater because by the sounds of things, it is extremely loud, and I like to be in control of the height of my movie watching volume. This takes everything that was good about ""The Mummy"" and practically quadruples it. That makes it fun in spots, too much to really collect in your movie going memory in most places, yet always keeping your attention. At least there is a story there, and the continuity from the first film to this hasn't been greatly sacrificed outside the return of Imhotep. If you can get past the absurdities, you'll have a good time, but my mind's eye tells me that I'll have to give this another shot again in about five years to catch what I missed the first two times around.",The Mummy Returns
5,lee_eisenberg,"You kids have it easy. You only have to kill the mummy twice. Back in my day, we had to kill him thrice.",7,5 March 2006,"Mostly a rehash of the original, but this time, there's the Scorpion King (The Rock) to shake things up a bit. I actually saw this movie in Spain, so the one-liners were often hard to translate. But overall, we now know that movies from the 1930's are to be remade in the 1950's-1970's with a sense of camp, and then remade in the 21st century as crosses between David Lean-style epics and Harrison Ford action flicks; not only ""The Mummy"", but also ""King Kong"" comes to mind. But now that Brendan Fraser has starred in a Best Picture winner (""Crash"") and Rachel Weisz has won Best Supporting Actress for ""The Constant Gardener"", I expect no more mummies.And one more thing: why did the Scorpion King get his own movie? I never saw it but heard that it was just an excuse for buff men to flex their muscles. It was actually released the same weekend as ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", which of course is much more well remembered. No surprise there.",The Mummy Returns
6,jboothmillard,The Mummy Returns,5,23 June 2005,"If you liked the original 1999 story of an Egyptian monster brought back to life, then you might like the sequel. The film starts with the story of The Scorpion King (wrestler The Rock) who swore an oath and his soul to the god Anubis, and after he had done what he wanted, they all returned to the sands, waiting to be woken again. Then it is 1933, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is still exploring Egyptian places, along with wife Evelyn ""Evie"" (Rachel Weisz) and their son Alex (Freddie Boath). Soon after returning to London, the bad guys have brought the body of High Priest Imhotep, and they just need the bracelet of The Scorpion King to help him take over the world. They bring Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) back, and he is reunited with the body (no soul yet) of Meela Nais, aka Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez). They do eventually get the bracelet, that is on the arm of Alex, and with his help they navigate their way round Egypt to find the burial of The Scorpion King so Imhotep can kill him. Meanwhile, Rick, Evie, Jonathan (John Hannah), Medjai Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) and balloonist Izzy Buttons (Human Traffic's Shaun Parkes) they are following Alex's trail and trying to help Alex before the sun rises and sucks the life out of him. Eventually they save Alex, and the bracelet is taken by the guy responsible for bringing Imhotep back, but the Madjai still have to fight off the army of Anubis soldiers, aka dog soldiers (LOL), Evie (or Princess Nefertiri) is fighting Anck Su Namun, and Rick is fighting now mortal and powerless Imhotep, as well as The Scorpion King, who has turned into a giant scorpion, a lot of fights. Also starring Alun Armstrong as Baltus Hafez and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Lock-Nah (now in TV's Lost). The story is still quite cheesy, but the special effects are much more elaborate. Rachel Weisz was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses. Worth watching!",The Mummy Returns
7,ccthemovieman-1,Yet Another Example Of Overkill,4,11 April 2007,"Here is another ""Class A exhibit"" on how to turn a successful, appealing movie into a ludicrous stupid one with a sequel that overkills everything that worked in the first movie.When the 1999 film, ""The Mummy"" came out, it features a likable family: husband, wife and young son - battling all kinds of strange and fascinating foes in ancient Egypt. It was simply a fun movie with awesome special-effects that dazzled millions of theater-goers. The story was ludicrous but took a back seat to the astounding visuals and the nice family whom we could root for.Then the sequel comes out - Mummy 2, if you will - and now (a) the wife (played by Rachel Weisz) has turned macho; (b) the kid is now a mouthy snot; (c) the action scenes have gone from a good number to an excessive amount where it is two hours of non-stop mayhem; (d) the sound has gone from loud to ear-shattering. In other words, here we go again with ""excess"""" or ""overkill,.""It's too much....way too much....and so poorly done I am not surprised a third in the series hasn't been released, although rumors have it there will be another in 2008. I can't imagine how bad that one will be if imitates this one.",The Mummy Returns
8,Tweekums,A solid sequel with almost nonstop action,7,19 September 2016,"This sequel opens in ancient Egypt and shows a warrior known as 'The Scorpion King' raise an army and set about conquering the known world. Eventually he is defeated and as he is about to die in the desert he prays to Anubis; he gives him a new army and he takes Egypt but is then taken by Anubis.The action then moves forward to 1932 and explorer Rick O'Connell and his wife Evelyn are searching a site in Egypt; Evelyn had strange visions that led her to the Bracelet of Anubis. They return to London with it and their son Alex puts it on; it locks onto his wrist and shows him a vision of Ahm Shere, in Egypt. Meanwhile a cult has raised Imhotep; hoping that he can defeat the Scorpion King and take command of his army to do that they kidnap Alex and take him to Egypt; along the way Alex is told that he has seven days from the moment he put the bracelet on to get to Ahm Shere or he will die. His parents, along with his uncle Jonathan and Ardeth Bay, set off in pursuit and before the time limit is up they come across a variety of dangers and ultimately must confront the risen Scorpion King.Fans of the first film will almost certainly enjoy this; the plot is fairly ridiculous but that doesn't matter as the action barely stops from start to finish. The action is pretty good for the most part although some of the CGI is certainly showing its age; unfortunately this includes the Scorpion King himself. The central cast are pretty good; Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have a good chemistry as Rick and Evelyn and John Hannah provides some good laughs as Johnathon. Shaun Parkes also provides some funny moments as Izzy, the pilot of a dirigible who has had bad experiences when working with Rick in the past. Overall this is a solid 'Boys' Own' adventure with little material that could offend and thrills that are suitable for older children and adults wanting good silly fun.",The Mummy Returns

10,Quinoa1984,Watch the Rock turn into a scorpion...and give the people's eyebrow,6,7 May 2001,"(possible rock spoilers ahead)In this sequel to the first film, which is just slightly lesser than this one, the deja-vu style sets in as Fraser and company face of against Imhotep again to stop him from ressurecting the infamous Scorpion King (The Rock). At times my mind was going crazy from the illogical plot points (running from sunlight and water, etc.), but the film compensates with amazing visual effects and tightly done action sequences (those battle and fight scenes are quite well done).  Good of it's kind (popcorn style), as long as you turn off part of you brain in the process.And by the way, going back to the Rock, he only appears in acting role for about 10 minutes and then later appears in computer face on a giant scorpion.  While his role is nothing more than a glorified cameo, he does what he can for the movie and is actually amusing doing the rock bottom on helpless soldiers (just remember, most wrestlers have to do a trademark move or trademark in the movies ala Hulk Hogan leg drop in films).  Best scene to look for though: the little mummies.  B+",The Mummy Returns
11,Coventry,Do not watch if you're older than 15,1,21 June 2005,"The first Stephen Sommers mummy-movie, released in 1999, already was a lousy and overly boisterous film that focused on the visual eye-candy rather than to re-tell the classic Imothep-tale properly. Still, it had its compelling moments and enough humor to put the whole production into perspective. Even the more experienced horror fan, who seeks atmosphere instead of excitement, could find a bit of joy in ""The Mummy"". This rapidly finished sequel, however, fully aims itself at (pre-) teen audiences who never in their lives saw a good movie and waste their days with playing video games! The script is a mess, revolving on the resurrection of Imothep (again) and the coming of a new Egyptian bad-boy, namely ""The Scorpion King"". Rick and Evelyn O'Connor (the heroes of the first) as well as Imothep intend to destroy ""The Scorpion King"", but for different purposes. The mean mummy wants to take of command of Scorpion's army and wipe out the world whereas the archaeologists-couple tries to prevent this. There's a giant amount of totally redundant sequences and it looks like they were only added to show good the makers are with computer-engineered special effects. Okay, we got it...tell a story instead! Every dead end or illogical aspect in the script is resolved with another attention-distracting visual trick and  after a while  it looks like the writers aren't even trying to be ingenious anymore. The acting is really bad with Fraser and Weisz both thinking about their paychecks instead of their lines and the introduction of cinema's most annoying child-actor in history: Freddie Boath. He's an 8-year-old brat who supposedly has more archaeologist-knowledge than an army of university professors. John Hannah also walks around the sets for no reason. He had a few funny one-liners and grimaces in the first film, but his part here is pretty much pointless. For some incomprehensible reason, this movie is pretty loved among IMDb-members (judging by the ratings and user comments) but I can't think of any positive (or even redeeming) comments in favor of it. I'm sorry",The Mummy Returns
12,michaelRokeefe,Merry old England has a mummy amuck.,7,31 May 2001,"This time out I am less critical, because this runs circles around the first entry in '99. Brendan Fraser is much easier to take as the ultimate reluctant hero. Of course he is very ""whipped"" and who wouldn't be partnered with Rachel Weisz? She impresses me more than ever. What a stunning looker and a very athletic actress. The couple's son played by Freddie Boath can at times be a pain in the butt. The story line plays a back row seat to the special effects and almost non-stop action.Rick and 'Evie' O'Connell not only have to control the awakened mummy of High Priest Imhotep(Arnold Vosloo); they also have to fend off the likes of 'sand soldiers', pygmies, scorpions and the Scorpion King himself played by professional wrestler Dwayne(The Rock)Johnson.Also appearing in this fun time summer thriller are Oded Fehr, John Hannah and Shaun Parkes. Worthwhile fantasy flick. Can you dig it?",The Mummy Returns
13,hitchcockthelegend,"Yeah, right, and no harm ever came from reading a book. You remember how that one went?",7,14 August 2013,"After the financial success of ""The Mummy"" two years earlier, the sequel was inevitable. The big players from the first film are back, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr. Stephen Sommers once again directs (and writes), Patricia Velasquez comes in to be a main player after her cameo in the first film, and young Freddie Boath plays the son of Rick and Evelyn who are now married. This time the cameo goes to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson who plays The Scorpion King and who is replaced by a very bad CGI version of himself at film's finale.When the second sequel, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (2008), was released, Brendan Fraser went on record as saying that for ""The Mummy Returns"" they basically remade the film they had already made in 1999! This is absolutely true, some new characters and an expansion on the O'Connell romance have been put in to beef it up, while some Zombie Pygmies are around to add extra monster factor, but yes! It's a re-tread only with more money spent, more effects (and better effects apart from Scorpion King) and more noise. This actually is OK for those who enjoyed the first film immensely, because ""Returns"" is every bit as enjoyable as family blockbuster entertainment. The Worldwide box offices rang to the tune of over $330 million in profit. That's a lot of happy families you would think!.So yes, it's a bit of a cheat, but much like the film before it, it gets away with it because the makers do everything they can to entertain the action/adventure loving crowd. With legions of Anubis warriors, those awesome Pygmies and the all round funny by-play between a cast comfortable with the material (again), ""The Mummy Returns"" delivers exactly what can reasonably be expected of it. 7/10",The Mummy Returns
14,Theo Robertson,A Film Shouldn`t Revolve Around CGI,5,15 May 2003,"The problem I had with the original film was that the script seemed to be written around the special effects , especially the CGI . Well the bad news about the sequel is that it suffers from the same problem multiplied by ten. Witness the opening prologue of massed armies fighting , an oasis appearing from nowhere and the scorpian king`s army overrunning a city all of which might have looked good on paper but on screen is badly executed due to some really apalling CGI . I don`t know what it is about this type of cinema technology but think of all the films where it`s been used in set pieces that fail to convince ( ESCAPE FROM LA , DIE ANOTHER DAY etc ) and watching it used in THE MUMMY RETURNS  left me shaking my head wondering why directors and FX maestros haven`t been able to improve upon it . Watching the action scenes in this movie is like watching a cartoon.Equally unconvincing and uninvolving is the screenplay which revolves around the bad guys wanting to get their hands on Rachel Weisz chest . Who can blame them ? you ask , well it`s not that sort of chest I`m talking about , it`s a treasure chest containing something or another which I didn`t bother to digest because the plot takes second place to a bunch of CGI inspired set pieces . Unfortunately most of the set pieces are stolen from the previous film which gave me a feeling THE MUMMY REMADE WITH A SEQUENCE STOLEN FROM JURASSIC PARK:THE LOST WORLD would have been a better title . And watch out for the number of scenes where one of the good guys is in serious trouble only to have the hero appear to save the day . It really does get tedious after the first three or four times it happensI may be accused of taking this film far too seriously and not realising it`s a dumb popcorn movie . Perhaps but what`s wrong with an intelligent popcorn movie ? And does anyone else miss the good old days when monsters were men dressed up in costumes or stop frame photography ?",The Mummy Returns
15,preppy-3,"Loud, silly, PG-rated violence...",7,2 May 2001,"basically a typical summer blockbuster!  I saw it at a sneak preview last night and I mostly liked it.  The action is virtually non-stop, the special effects (except for one monster at the end) are incredible and the film never stops moving.  But the plot makes no sense (something about a Scorpion King and the Mummy fighting), characterizations are nonexistent and there's some truly awful dialogue.  Also in a movie that takes place in the 1930s, terms like ""Are we there yet?"" ""Whatever..."" and ""Get a room"" did not exist! That may be nitpicking, but it bothered me.  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and John Hannah all reprise their roles from the original.  They're all very good here...too bad they have nothing to play with.  But, I was never bored. It's a movie where you turn off your mind, sit back and enjoy the ride.  In other words, a very good summer movie!",The Mummy Returns
16,poolandrews,"""You know, a couple of years ago, this would have seemed really strange to me."" Highly enjoyable big budget action.",8,28 October 2006,"The Mummy Returns begins in 'Egypt 1933' where the now married Rick (Brendan Fraser) & Evelyn O'Connell (Rachel Weisz) are on the trail of an ancient artifact called The Bracelet of Anubis, a bracelet that belonged to the evil Mathayus the Scorpion King (The Rock) centuries ago. Meanwhile at Hamunaptra the city of the dead the evil Baltus Hafez (Alun Armstrong) & Meela Nais (Patricia Velasquez) the reincarnation of Egyptian princess Anck Su Namun have discovered the remains of the high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who they intend to bring back to life to fight & defeat the reincarnated Scorpion King & take control of his army that will enable them to conquer the earth. However Baltus needs the Bracelt of Anubis to reveal the location of the Scorpion King's pyramid & they will go to any lengths to gain possession of the bracelet which currently Rick & Evelyn have although unknown to them their young son Alex (Freddie Boath) has it on his wrist. Baltus & his gang kidnap Alex & use him to show them the way to the Scorpion King, although Rick, Evelyn, Jonathan (John Hannah) & Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) are hot on their tails to save Alex & the world...Written & directed by Stephen Sommers The Mummy Returns was the sequel to the smash hit remake of The Mummy (1999) & in my opinion is a slightly better film. The script is all about being bigger, louder & better than the original with one extravagant overblown set-piece after another. The film moves along like a rocket, in fact The Mummy Retrurns has to be one of the fastest paced films I've ever seen, there's barely a scene that goes by where there isn't a special effect, shoot-out, chase, explosion or some sort of action. As a result the character's are pretty shallow & I honestly don't know why Jonathan is back as he does nothing, I think in some ways they're as much of a passenger as we, the viewer, are. The story introduces all sorts of mythical Egyptian cities, legends & monsters & feels very much like an Indiana Jones globe-trotting action packed adventure with a hint of archaeology & horror thrown in there! Although The Mummy Returns is about as far removed from reality as any film can be so don't expect to learn anything, if you know what I mean. The Mummy Returns is big budget over-the-top entertainment that I thought was great fun & had had many enjoyable sequences although it's a little silly & a bit overlong at over two hours.Director Sommers does a good job, there's plenty of flashy CGI effects & some great action sequences. Everything looks great, the production design is top-notch as are the costumes, locations & period sets. The fights are well choreographed & I rather liked the the Scorpion King monster at the end even if the close-up special effects aren't the best. Not that it matters but if you look at Rachel Weisz's boots she wears throughout the film you'll notice how the heel changes between shots, sometimes she has high heels, then medium & then totally flat soles depending on what she has to do, however I'll cut her some slack as I don't think you could do back-flips in high heels without breaking your ankles...With a supposed budget of about $98,000,000 The Mummy Returns is well made & has that big budget Hollywood polish to it. The acting is almost incidental, it's not particularly good from anyone but it'll do. Is it just me or does anyone else think Rachel Weisz looks really hot in this?The Mummy Returns in my opinion is a great film, it moves along like a rocket & it has some terrific action scenes & special effects. There's plenty of bang for your money here, definitely worth a watch & I reckon it's a highly entertaining film. After proving popular here The Rock got his own spin-off film The Scorpion King (2002) while on the back of The Mummy Returns the animated TV series The Mummy: The Animated Series (2001) was made.",The Mummy Returns
17,CinemaSerf,It's not at all bad as sequels go....,7,7 December 2019,"This is, actually, every bit as good as it's daddy - but why, oh why, do we always to have to introduce children into the mix? In this case Fredddie Boath joins the gang of intrepid adventurers trying to save the world from the scourge of a recently re-reincarnated mummy (a re-born, born again sort of thing!). He finds the Bracelet of Anubis, gets kidnapped and off we go on a fun race against time across the desert encountering all sorts of dangers and evil critters along the way. This one also introduces us to the ""Scorpion King"" (least said, I think) and Sommers, again, keeps this all moving along apace. It is just entertainment and if you look for nothing more then - of it's genre, it isn't disappointing.",The Mummy Returns
18,lastliberal,Rachel Weisz is fantastic,7,2 May 2007,"I got a chance to see Rachel Weisz in a dark movie last night, but she really shines in this film. I continue to be impressed by her range. It's not a great film by any measure, but it is good fun. Weisz's duel with Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnated Anck-su-Namun was incredible.This is, in one sense, a family movie, al la ""True Lies."" Dad (Brendon Frazier), mom (Weisz) and son (Freddie Boath) all fight together to defeat Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo). There is even a kooky brother-in-law (John Hannah) - a real family adventure.This is the second film for ""The Rock."" He was in ""Longshot,"" but way down on the billing as a mugger. Here he rises to prominence in a cast, but his character is quite ridiculous. It's something out of a ""B"" movie.All in all, if you are looking for some mindless entertainment on a Saturday night, this film can frequently be found on USA.

More action, more special effects, more comedy, more new characters and more different plot lines. Is it all better? Perhaps if the movie was more original and not so much an extension of the first movie, then perhaps it would had been.If you enjoyed the first ""The Mummy"", you'll probably also enjoy watching this movie. It's in the same style and follows the same characters, with just a few more new adjustments to it. Not all are for the best though.Compared to the first movie, this movie obviously has an highly budget and it uses this for some more big scale battles, at the beginning and end of the movie. It also puts in some overall more action sequences and more traveling elements, which helps to provide the movie with its fun and adventurous feeling.They also tried to put some more layers into the story, involving the same characters from the first movie but none of this ever really works out, since these plot line differ way too much from the characters as we got introduced to in the first movie. There also are some new characters in the movie. The O'Connell's now have a son. Why oh why do movies always feel the need to put in kids into the story. As a matter of fact the character is quite entertaining in the movie but at the same time annoying because he just feels so completely redundant. Luckily John Hannah is still present for the comical notes of the movie and Arnold Vosloo as the charismatic mummy. This is the role he definitely will be remembered for, even though it isn't a very demanding role.Very much like the first movie launched the careers of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, this movie launched the acting career of The Rock. Yes he's painfully horrible in this movie, despite having no lines but he's such a great new action hero star. He definitely is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger, who obviously also wasn't the best actor around but still a big and popular one. It was also fun to see Alun Armstrong in the movie, though he's hard to recognize. Also Patricia Velasquez's role has been extended, which is a welcome thing.Like most sequels, it's tries (too) hard to surpass its first movie, in terms of size and spectacle. Yes, it provides the movie with some great moments but yet the movie feels more of the same. It's not a bad thing, since the movie is still perfectly fun and entertaining but its lack of originality and new ideas is disturbing at times and makes me worried for ""The Mummy 3"", if there is ever going to be such a movie.The ending is sort of an anti-climax, when a computer animated scorpion king appears, that looks nothing like The Rock and looks as if it came straight out of a playstation game. It's a bit of a disappointing ending but luckily the rest of the movie is good enough to compensate for this and still make this is perfectly fun and watchable movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Mummy Returns
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"He does return, and he brings nothing new with him",6,30 December 2009,"More of the same. For anyone wondering, no, I don't like Indiana Jones either(though I've barely watched any; I do believe that I'd enjoy it, and I can't say that for this). You know, I really wish I could say something nice about Sommers. No, honestly. For as cathartic as it can be to unleash a verbal smack-down in these reviews, it is nothing compared to how satisfying it is to point to what a certain film-maker does that sets them apart from the rest. Be it an uncompromising vision, perfectionism, or, heck, simpler things such as them always making the viewer laugh, or being dependable to provide exciting pictures. But I can find no such thing about him. Well, to be accurate, nothing that is *positive*. The numerous holes that this(the *second flick*) creates in the continuity are one of the signs that he expects the audience to just ignore all of the inconsistencies, to not question the fiction we are served. While there are a couple of things that are kinda cool, and the occasional second here and there of the non-stop action that doesn't suck, everything is still ridiculously over the top. Can he please limit his crap to focusing on only one catastrophe at a time? The effects continue to be the real attraction(and they're already outdated), albeit this has less of people standing around to admire the aesthetic value of the source of the immediate danger that they are in. I don't know why they chose to cut corners with several of the FX, instead of figuring out a different way to do the sequence(it would be less obvious). Bits in this mirror the first, only here, it makes even less sense. Rick himself has a line about how convenient the plot is. Every character is obnoxious, and this adds an intolerable kid. I repeat the question: Who are we meant to care about? Emotion is invariably phoned in, mainly because of the tone. A handful of these performers can act, elsewhere... it is not a myth, I have seen it. A couple of them may make an effort here. Oded Fehr remains my favorite thing about these. The Rock has so little to do that you can barely be disappointed; it is worth noting, however, that, in this, his face often seems to indicate that the desert exudes an incredibly rank odor. Oh, wait, sorry... that's him trying to look bad-ass. This is powerfully unfunny, and a few moments are disgusting. When did Imhotep develop outright telekinesis? And why on Earth does he only use it sometimes? There is mild, if potentially disturbing, violence in this. Well, the mummies do, to an extent and every now and again, actually have the appearance they're supposed to. And this provides hot chicks(including showing them briefly half-naked) for us straight males to gawk at. I mean, I've never noticed before that Weisz is that sexy. Maybe this is the only time she's had cleavage so much in the space of two hours, and her legs featured prominently in as frequent shots as here. In ways(not all), this is not as awful as the original. I recommend this to any fans of that, and/or of cheesy adventure movies in general. 6/10",The Mummy Returns
21,view_and_review,The Mummy should have stayed dead,5,21 June 2007,"This movie is average at best and it's only saving grace are its special effects. The story is lousy, and if this is considered a horror, then so should the movie ""Toy Story"". Who wouldn't be afraid of walking talking toys? This movie was definitely more comedy than horror and not a good one at that. The child genius only made the movie more absurd. And I say child genius because what kid would have been as intelligent as to leave the abstract yet incredibly accurate clues that he left for his parents to find him? ""The Mummy Returns"" was just another platform for Hollywood to show off its newest tricktography.",The Mummy Returns
22,Uriah43,A Film Containing Action and CGI in Lieu of Suspense and Horror,6,26 February 2019,"This film begins in ancient times with a warrior known as ""the Scorpion King"" (Dwayne Johnson) amassing an army for which he intends to conquer the known world. To his dismay he is soundly defeated while besieging Thebes and as a consequence he is left wandering in the desert with no food or water. It's then that he prays to the Egyptian god Anubus and promises his soul for the opportuntity to defeat his enemies one last time. True to his word, Anubus grants this request by conjuring up an army of jackal warriors for which the Scorpion King does indeed conquer everything in his path to include the city of Thebes. But as soon as he tastes his hard-fought victory Anubus claims soul of the Scorpion King along with the army given to him. The scene then shifts to five thousand years later with an archeologist named ""Rick O'Connell"" (Brendon Frazer) and his wife ""Evelyn O'Connell"" in the process of exploring a tomb near ancient Thebes. Also with them is their young son ""Alexander O'Connell"" who discovers a small chest which contains a gold bracelet. Upon putting it on his wrist he suddenly sees a vision of where the Scorpion King's sepulcher is located. Not long afterward, the curator of the British Museum resurrects the mummy of ""Imhotep"" () who plans on resurrecting the Scorpion King for the purpose of killing him and assuming command of his army in order to conquer the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had numerous sub-plots which became rather confusing at time. Likewise, the inclusion of numerous action scenes and CGI in lieu of any noticeable suspense or horror was also a feature which lessened the overall potential this film could have had. Be that as it may, while it certainly wasn't a bad film by any means, it could have been much better and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Mummy Returns
23,ferguson-6,Feels like Mummy Reruns,5,16 May 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Same old story for a sequel.  Make it a little bigger and a little louder, and people will flock to the theatres ... especially if it is released at a very slow time for movies!  Rachel Weisz gets much more physical in this one.  This along with a ""smart beyond his years"" kid are two of the three changes from the original.  Still no story line to follow.  Just an incredible succession of special effects.  The early scenes with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, gave a flicker of hope for a real story; however, his screen time was disappointingly brief.  That is, except for the animated mess at the end.  You will not be able to stop shaking your head at his return.  Hopefully this was meant as a big joke by our ""director"".  Arnold Vosloo is the only one to put forth any acting effort, but the weak script prevents us from seeing what he's made of. Unless you have a high dollar home theatre, this will be a flop on video.

It opens with the reign of the Scorpion King who conquered many armies until his defeat. Left for dead, he gives his soul for revenge. Jump ahead a few centuries and Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz now have an annoyingly idiotic son who causes the ritual release of the Scorpion King because he has been taking stupid lessons from the screenwriter. They research the tombs because TV has not been invented yet. The rest is all action and outrunning bullets and tidal waves. Director Stephen Sommers manages to creates a mess with unlimited help from the cast. Fraser is required to run and fight while making narrow escapes and witless remarks. Weisz is plainly just there to prove that her talent is best suited somewhere else. John Hannah plays her less than swift brother. Freddie Boath plays the stupidest character in the film as the kid who fails to use his brain for anything. Finally there is Dwayne Johnson as the Scorpion King who starts out Intriguing until he becomes reduced to another playground fight. The special effects are the norm but hardly a saving factor.

25,FlashCallahan,The Mummy: The Animated series......,6,5 July 2015,"Rick O'Connell is now married to Evelyn and has settled in London, where they are raising their 8-year-old son Alex. When a chain of events finds the corpse of Imhotep resurrected in the British Museum, the mummy Imhotep walks the earth once more, determined to fulfil his quest for immortality. But another force has also been set loose in the world... one born of the darkest rituals of ancient Egyptian mysticism, and even more powerful than Imhotep. When these two forces clash, the fate of the world will hang in the balance, sending the O'Connells on a desperate race to save the world from unspeakable evil, and rescue their son before it is too late...Well after the huge success of the remake, a sequel was inevitable, and as expected, it's more of the same stuff. If it ain't broke don't fix it......just copy the set pieces from the first movie and switch the locations.And that's the film main problem, you have an irritating sense of déjà Vu whilst watching the movie. Fraser is still trying to be Harrison Ford, but alas,the script just leaves Rick a kind of sarcastic Jock who gets a bit sad toward the end.If anything, the film belongs to Weisz. If you can stomach the incoherent script, and convoluted narrative, her story (even though it's amazing it never came about in the first movie) is interesting, her character actually does something different, whereas everybody else from the first movie is doing the same thing, only not as good.The we have the inclusion of The Rock. His prologue sets the tone of the film up very well, and you can tell, even in his short role, he is going to be something of a screen presence.The Scorpion King is a worthy villain in the franchise, but the biggest villain in the film is the woeful CGI. Back then it was poor, watching it now, it's as if Sommers just couldn't be bothered, because he knew it would make big bucks, and the final third of the film is ruined, thanks to the abomination of the CGI Scorpion King.Because of this, there is no urgency, and the feel of adventure is gone, because you are too busy wincing at the poor effects.So for a sequel, if you liked the first, you'll find something here, because all the makers have done have took all the good elements of the first movie, and relocating it.Did I mention the abhorrent CGI....",The Mummy Returns
26,Aaron1375,"More action in this sequel, but the plot isn't as good.",8,24 April 2003,"This one is very action packed this time around.  From start to finish is almost one action scene after another.  Unfortunately, it is not better than the first mummy because its plot leaves a bit to be desired.  First off, the mummy doesn't seem to be important enough in the plot.  The title of the movie is the mummy, but he doesn't seem to be the focus he should be.  Then there is the Scorpion King plot.  I don't mind that too much, but it just lessened the importance of the mummy further.  Thankfully, the Rock has no speaking lines and not much screen time to muck up the film.  Still aside from these and a few more story problems, this movie is a great action flick.  Best to just turn off your brain and enjoy all the action such as the cool bus chase in London or the forest filled with the little creatures. The effects, like in the first one, are pretty good...but nothing really ground breaking.  The Scorpion King at the end though was a pretty cool looking character that looked like one of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion creatures.  Looking for action though, then this is your movie.",The Mummy Returns
27,Wuchakk,Bigger is NOT always better; here it's overKILL,4,11 March 2014,"I'm a fan of the first movie from 1999 and was naturally looking forward to this 2001 sequel. I originally saw it at the theater with two friends; after about 10-15 minutes we were all bored by the bombardment of action and F/X. We just laid back in our seats in tedium for the remaining couple hours.It's a curious thing that too much action and F/X in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true; and ""The Mummy Returns"" is Exhibit A. I usually give certain movies second and third chances in the hope that my first impression may have been in error, which I've done with this one over the years. Unfortunately I keep finding myself relatively detached from the story even though there are all kinds of exciting things going on; or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.""The Mummy Returns"" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. (although some of the CGI is woefully cartoony, like the Scorpion King at the close). It has great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a forgettable piece of cinematic dung. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. ""The Mummy Returns"" abandons the characters while the plot is utilized as a clothesline for action and F/X sequences.The flick curiously has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails to absorb the viewer. It is unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance or overKILL: having all the right elements, including budget, and yet stupefyingly fumbling the ball.The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes (overlong), and was shot in England, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt.GRADE: C-",The Mummy Returns
28,zetes,Unpretentious and fun. 7/10,7,4 May 2001,"The Mummy Returns is maybe a step above the first one. The action is non-stop, and it does manage, for the most part, to rouse the audience, or at least me. The good guys are likable. Brendan Fraser is where he belongs. Rachel Weisz is beautiful. John Hannah amuses as Jonathan, and Freddie Boath manages not to annoy as Alex, the kid. He's pretty good as a smart-mouthed brat. The bad guys are, for the most part, fun to hate. Im-Ho-Tep is a good villain. Maybe he isn't given enough to do here, but he's still cool. Patricia Valazquez is a real stunner as his love interst, Anck-Su-Namun. She's probably the best thing about the film. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was good as Lock Nah, the main henchman. Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the Rock as the Scorpion King. The narration during the film's prologue is not nearly as good as it would be if we were watching the story develop. The Scorpion King is basically a boring character. His computer-animated doppleganger at the film's climax is neat, but it would have been better if there were some feelings towards that character.People who know their action flicks will notice that the Mummy Returns steals about every action scene from every action movie made in the past 20 years, quoting movies like Aliens, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park 2 (why? that movie was terrible), and especially Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, with which, if you remember, The Mummy I was competing with in the box office successfully in May of 1999. They don't try to hide any of it. They even make a jest at Spielberg with a shadow against the moon from ET and Amblin Entertainment. It's all in good fun. You shouldn't be too angry at the sloppy script. If you are going to be angry, the shoddy computer animation should be your target. Still, it's not bad.",The Mummy Returns

There are bits of comedy with a small boy who manages to get himself deeply involved with a Scorpion bracelet and fits in quite well with this thriller of a story. Brendon Fraser, (Rich) sort of plays second fiddle to Rachel Weisz ,(Evelyn) who seems to handle the Scorpion King with no problems. If you hate looking at scorpions, you will definitely have your share and some might be larger than you plan to deal with in this film. Excellent production but rather too long and drawn out at times, but worth viewing.",The Mummy Returns
30,JamesHitchcock,Don't You Just Love Social Realism?,6,7 December 2004,"The plot of this film is too complex to set out in any great detail. Suffice it to say that a group of villains, including one of the curators of the British Museum, have revived the corpse of the Ancient Egyptian priest Imhotep, who was put to death for his part in the murder of the Pharaoh, a crime carried out by his wife Anck-su-Namun, who was also Imhotep's lover. The villains are also seeking to use a magic bracelet to revive the Scorpion King (a warrior from another period of Egyptian history who sold his soul to the dark god Anubis in exchange for military success) and his army. The idea is that they will then use Imhotep to kill the Scorpion King, which will give them control of his army, which they will then use to achieve their ambition of world domination. The only people who can thwart their schemes are Rick O'Connell, an American archaeologist, and his beautiful English wife Evelyn, whose young son Alex has stolen the magic bracelet. Evelyn just happens to be the reincarnation of the daughter of the murdered Pharaoh.You get the general idea. Don't you just love social realism?Despite the fact that the plot of 'The Mummy Returns' is clearly nonsensical, I rather enjoyed the film. It is set in the 1930s, and it clearly owes much to the 'Indiana Jones' films, also set in that period. Both involve Egyptian archaeology and artefacts with mystical powers. Although this will sound heretical to the army of Spielberg devotees, who have voted 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to number 17 in your list of the 250 best movies of all time, I have to say that I enjoyed 'The Mummy Returns' at least as much as any of the 'Indiana Jones' series (and considerably more than 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'). The reason is that the film is fast-paced and occasionally witty; the film whisks the viewer from one adventure to another and generates enough excitement to make him or her forget the many absurdities and inconsistencies in the script. The film never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously, a mistake that can often ruin an adventure film of this nature. The best thing about this film is that it stars the gorgeous Rachel Weisz. Indeed, it helped to change my ideas about her. I had previously seen Rachel as an attractive, but rather conservative and proper actress, always playing English rose types in art-house movies. 'The Mummy Returns' (I have never seen 'The Mummy') showed that she has a larger range than this and has not only the looks, but also the sex appeal and cinematic presence, to take the lead in Hollywood blockbusters. (Her predecessor as official English Rose, Helena Bonham Carter, has also made a similar move). Brendan Fraser has never really been my favourite actor, but here he did well as Rick, the solid and dependable family man. This is very much a 'family values' thriller, like 'True Lies' or 'The River Wild', in which mum, dad and the kid all play their part in thwarting the bad guys. This phenomenon perhaps marks a change in the way in which women are seen by the film industry. At one time, leading actresses often disliked being cast as a mother, even of young children, as it was seen as a sign that their career as a leading lady was over and that henceforward they only had 'character' roles to look forward to. Rachel Weisz, however, plays a mother both here and in her next film, 'About a Boy', without her career suffering any harm. Of the other characters, there was an amusing cameo from John Hannah as Jonathan, Evelyn's cowardly and avaricious brother. The villains do not really stand out , with the exception of Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnated Anck-su-Namun, a villainess almost as sexy as the heroine. (Her duel with Rachel Weisz will probably strike most male viewers as the film's most memorable scene). The sense of menace overhanging the heroes comes more from the film's computer-generated effects. One thing I did not like was the Scorpion King, in the early scenes a human being but in the later ones a rather ridiculous and unconvincing half-man half-scorpion monster like something from a cheap B-movie. In a way, the film could be seen as a modern-day B-movie; an updated large-scale big-budget version of those old Saturday morning quickies. Much the same thing, however, could be said of many of Spielberg's films (and not just Indiana Jones). 'The Mummy Returns' may be nonsense, but at least it is entertaining nonsense. 6/10",The Mummy Returns

Sort of.,3,19 May 2013,"How on earth can one movie have such an impact, please so many people, make so much moneythat they honestly believe spending a buck fifty on special effects for the follow-up is a good idea?The special effects, namely The Rock's Scorpion King, was so bad in The Mummy Returns, I honestly couldn't get past it. Yes, I know FX doesn't make the whole movie experience, but these were so comical, so cartoonish – and even in 2001 – that the movie was more of an unintentional comedy that the humor it tried hard to produce.The movie is, in fact, bookended by the worst special effects, namely the laugh-out-loud pasted on Rock's head finale, but the overall movie was so much a recap of the original 1999, that I barely remembered I was watching the sequel.Granted, they decided the best way to make more money or milk this franchise dry like the deserts its set in, is just to rehash everything from The Mummy (1999.) In fact, the only thing that really changed was the transformation of the actual ""mummy"" took mere seconds when the first film took much more efforts from the characters.The basic plot revolves around a soul-selling warrior – a la Scorpion King, the new adventures of the new O'Connell family and the Mummy's Revenge, sort of.Look, I've only seen this movie once in theatres in 2001 and just one more time about a week ago. I've put off the review until now and I've seemed to forget everything that happened in this movie, aside from a fairly decent car/bus chase scene I did like, set in London and the atrocious and hilarious Scorpion King finale. One that was so bad, I never bothered with the spin-offs. Even if they advanced in CGI, I seriously couldn't care less to revisit that character.This doesn't fair well for this movie.

It also keeps up the same fun tone and slightly irreverent feel, which makes for an overall enjoyable experience. It does, however, feel a bit tamer this time and isn't quite as tight overall. Still, everything is painted with a broadly fantastical brush and the flick introduces some fairly unique back-story elements that surely provided inspiration for Sofia Boutella's recent incarnation of the bandaged bogeyman. When 'The Rock' turns up as a fully CG creature, things take a turn for the worse, though; that particular special effect is still possibly one of the worst I've seen in a piece of this size. Nevertheless, the movie is an entertaining time, despite its few flaws. 7/10.",The Mummy Returns
37,bowmanblue,"Good, but not – quite – as good as the first",7,11 January 2015,"The first 'Mummy' film was a classic. No, not in the 'Godfather' kind of way. No, it certainly won't be remembered as one of the greats when it comes to the history of cinema. However, it was a fun little film which has its place on TV on a Saturday afternoon. It was a good action-adventure film which could be enjoyed by all the family without much of a need for brainpower.Yes, it could be looked at as a 'poor man's Indiana Jones,' but it was just such fun it should be afforded some of its misgivings and simply enjoyed for what it was. So, because of its simple success (and commercial, obviously), a sequel was quickly greenlit. The second instalment certainly gets a fair few things right, yet it never quite gels together like the first. Not that's it's bad, it's just not – quite – as good as the first.The best thing about it is the cast. They all return from the original. And it's nice to see the two central characters (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) don't need to fall in love all over again. They're married now and they have a child, Alex, who's not as annoying as 99% of the children we see in films. In fact, instead of Rik having to rescue Evelyn constantly, the two of them have to rescue their son. Yes, the Mummy does indeed return (never mind how he was firmly killed and dragged to hell in the first instalment. He's now back, okay?) and wants to borrow the mythical 'Scorpion King's' army with which he can then take over the world again. Unfortunately, little Alex just so happens to have the only bracelet attached to him, so he's captured and subsequently dragged half way around the world into to raise the army.One of the things 'The Mummy Returns' will always be known for is that it's the first filmic outing for 'The Rock' (better known nowadays as, former wrestler, Dwayne Johnson). He plays the Scorpion King himself – a secondary villain, also not the type you want to get hold of either your only son, or an army capable of taking over the world. It's a brave attempt to crowbar another villain into the mix, but he's not properly in it until the final showdown, therefore the main villain we go with is the Mummy, simply because he was in the first film and is basically in the second outing all the way through.So, The Mummy Returns sits nicely alongside its predecessor in the 'Saturday matinée' type of film. It too will be enjoyed by most families with a sense of humour and a forgiving nature towards daft films. But it's not perfect. It's hard to explain exactly what's wrong with it, but there's something there that doesn't feel right. And it wasn't in the first. It does seem a little more formulaic than the first. You get one action scene after the next, even going as far as to copy the sandstorm from the first film and changing it slightly using water instead of sand.It's a nice little film and most people should like it. Perhaps it's best to let the Mummy franchise die there. It will certainly save you from the very disappointing third instalment.",The Mummy Returns
38,MLDinTN,The Mummy was great...,5,28 May 2002,"But the sequel has less to be desired.  I saw this film expecting great things, but I was sorely disappointed.  I missed the laughs and the romance that the first Mummy had.  The Mummy Returns wasn't funny and the plot was too convoluted to make any sense. Also some of the CGI critters did not have much appeal. I loved how the mummy looked in the first film.  But in this one, there isn't enough of the original mummy. Instead, we get the Rock with a scorpion body that looked so fake and those little munchkins running around.  And that kid, where do I start.  The word annoying comes to mind. I mean, why couldn't we have just had another film where Rick and Evie go on another adventure together.FINAL VERDICT:  If you want to see a great, funny, interesting adventure movie, watch The Mummy.   My advice is to avoid this sequel because watching the Mummy Returns will only ruin all the great things there is to like about the first one.",The Mummy Returns
39,Cineanalyst,Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Mummy,4,12 October 2018,"""The Mummy Returns"" is best when it's shamelessly recycling the story from the prior ""The Mummy"" (1999), especially when the characters joke about the repetition early on. Through the double-decker bus sequence, where they fight the same mummified soldiers from the last picture, and after the woman is once again saved from bondage, and after another temple full of booby traps and secret passages, and the kid repeating mommy's domino effect of bookcases but with columns this time, this sequel excels at recapturing the magic of movement and comic relief of its predecessor and the formula that was borrowed, as many others have pointed out, from the Indiana Jones franchise. But, then, there's a tonal shift towards the dramatic, including another kidnapping and some not-so-Ancient-Egyptian nonsense about reincarnated bodies and destinies spilling over from past lives, and, like the balloon of the airship, it's as though all the air was taken out of the fun.There's also an appreciation for the excess inherent in sequels--seemingly reaching back to Universal's past life of monster movie sequels beginning with ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), calling for the doubling of everything. So, now there are two mummies (Imhotep and the Scorpion King), two reincarnated women, two flashback scenes (one of which is shared by the two women), two men following ancient codes of protection (the good Egyptian from the last movie and the white American hero sporting a new tattoo), two abductions, two sets of travel and plots (train and airship), two countries, two fictional Ancient Egyptian sites and two real ones, even two black stereotypes (one the good clown, the other the evil buck). Not all of the excess amounts to much, though. The Scorpion King especially gets short shrift, and his CGI creature looks about as realistic as the stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen without an ounce of the charm. There's another curator, too, except he's evil this time, and we're offered hardly any explanation as to his motives and methods. And the whole past lives business seems to be here just so that the women can do fight moves between choppy editing just like the men. I miss the simplicity of the frumpy librarian flirting with the rugged, gun-toting adventurer.In addition to this sequel, like its predecessor, opening with an Ancient Egypt flashback, there's a shared flashback vision after the tonal shift, which elaborates upon the last movie's flashback: from one perspective, it's a pool vision like the one in the 1932 Boris Karloff ""Mummy,"" and the other is from the airship. Additionally, there are the visions from the bracelet serving as this one's map. Again, there are bugs and quicksand, and now there's an army of mummified Pygmies and Anubis Jackal-men, all providing disintegrating, bloodless PG-13 deaths and violence. As well as the gaping mouths from afore, this one adds catching thrown weapons. Like the sequel ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984), a kid is added, but fortunately nobody is named ""Short Round,"" and nobody eats monkey brains.",The Mummy Returns
40,g-bodyl,The Mummy Returns.....Better Than Ever!,10,10 January 2009,"The Mummy Returns is a very good sequel, much better than the first film. Most of the main characters return and some intriguing new characters appear for the first time. The special effects are better than the first film, obviously. There is another good blend of genres such as action, adventure, and comedy.Brendan Fraser returns as Rick O'Connell. He and his wife Evy along with their son, Alex find the bracelet of Anubis while a British Museum curator and Imhotep's old lover resurrects the powerful Imhotep. Alex gets kidnapped by Imhotep because he wears the bracelet and that is the guide to the Scorpion King. Now the O'Connells with Ardeth Bay have to rescue Alex and prevent Imhotep from taking control over the Scorpion King's army.The acting is great. Fraser did a better job than he did in the first film. Rachel Weisz is even more beautiful in this film and she is a fine actress. John Hannah cracked me up even more as the stupid uncle. The presence of a kid, Freddie Boath added youth to this film. I was happy to see that Oded Fehr got more screen time as the serious, bold protector of Imhotep's tomb.The special effects are much more effective especially when the water demon was chasing the O'Connells in the hot air balloon. The creatures by the Scorpion King's pyramid scared the living daylights out of me. I don't want to be chased by vicious creatures like those.Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10.",The Mummy Returns
41,CuriosityKilledShawn,"A fast-paced, inventive adventure",7,24 October 2004,"Mummy Returns takes the characters and story from the first film and develops on them in a big, big way. The situations and set-pieces are wilder, the odds even bigger and character arcs more complex.Set 10 years after the first movie Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have made a rich living out of plundering tombs and pyramids. Who could have predicted that their old nemesis I'm-Ho-Tep would return faster and stronger than before.But I'm still having trouble seeing I'm-Ho-Tep as a villain. Surely it's the scheming, lying, conspiring supplicants that are the real villains. The look in his eyes at the end, when his lover betrays him, is heartbreaking. I can't root for him as a bad guy when he never really does anything bad. Sure he wants to rule the world and all but who doesn't?The effects are not the best (Star Wars Episode 2 used up all the space at ILM at the time) but there are loads of them and they're all lavish and imaginative. I HATE movies that are carried by SFX but Mummy Returns incorporates them into the story in a seamless way. How cool is the big balloon? Or the approach of Anubis' army?Most directors screw-up big budget, big scale movies (AVP, King Arthur, Sky Captain, Exorcist Prequel, Catwoman) but Stephen Sommers knows where the heart of this kind of movie is and delivers, once again, a cheeky adventure with loads and loads of action and enough story and character to back it up. Filmed in Panavision the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is perfect and the Dolby/DTS 5.1 is very loud and thundering. A very good soundtrack indeed. The extras are total fluff and not worth the time.",The Mummy Returns

All the characters are great!, and the story is really cool as well, Plus while it can't match The Mummy it's still top notch for a sequel. I thought the special effects were cool even though the CGI was extremely obvious and the final was especially awesome, plus Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz had very good chemistry together once more. It had some awesome villains in Imhotep(Vosloo),Lock-Nah(Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Patricia Velasquez(Anck Su Namun), and all the characters were really likable!, plus Freddie Boath is surprisingly good as the young Alex and didn't annoy me at all. Yes it's weak script wise, but come on!, it's still really enjoyable if you put your brain in check!, plus there are a couple of great emotional moments in the film as well, especially at the end involving Imhotep!.The set pieces and setting are both great!,a nd there is some great humor thrown in just like the 1st as well!, plus I loved the opening narration and all the flashbacks of The Scorpion King and Anck Su Namun,Princess Nefertiri!. This is a great follow up to the mummy!, with plenty of exciting action and fantastic performances once again, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Stephen Sommers does a very good! job here with great camera work, cool visuals, good angles and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is awesome. Brendan Fraser is wonderful here once again, he had all of the assets as he did in the 1st,, had very good chemistry with Rachel Weisz, had some cool lines,and kicked that ass! (Fraser Rules!!).Rachel Weisz is gorgeous and does excellent here once more, while she didn't have as much to do, she still did an excellent job, and held her own opposite Fraser yet again!, they are two of the reasons why these Mummy movies are so enjoyable. John Hannah is hilarious once again, and cracked me up throughout and brought great comic relief. Arnold Vosloo is fantastic, only problem is he is not the only clear villain in this so he didn't have as much to do, still he had tons of presence!, i really dug him. Oded Fehr is very good here again i really like his character and he fought very well!.The Rock didn't have to act here in his role, but he rocked anyways!, More of him would have been nice!. (The Rock Rules!!!!!!!). Freddie Boath is surprisingly good as The kid, and didn't annoy me in fact he was rather likable!.Patricia Velasquez is hot and did well as both of her characters!.Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is very good, he is funny and also had quite a presence.

44,851222,Not good and poorly paced,6,25 January 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) was fan worse movie then superb first film. It lacks anything that made first film fun - very poorly paced, with lots of not fun adventures and some lines (lots of them actually) and acting that made my eyes rolling. Special effects weren't that special, check out this movie now and you will see how dated it looks now. And the ending with The Scorpion King was pretty OK, but special effects of the The Scorpion King himself has to be (still) one of the worst special effects efforts ever.Overall, ""The Mummy Returns"" is louder, more action oriented sequel that lacks everything that made first film truly fun and very impressively looking adventure.

45,tabuno,Entertaining in Style but not Substance,7,27 January 2019,"7 May 2001. While I enjoyed this sequel, I began watching the first Mummy and found myself more captivated. Perhaps, it was the actual action without the special effects and the use of more mystery and substance that made the first film more intriguing. The ending was a bit of a let down because the biggest weakness about the characterization of the evil Mummy's woman was that she was a weak flake, which really bums me out, because she really would have sacrificed her life to save her man too. So much for consistent characters being sacrificed for easy plot endings.",The Mummy Returns

48,Movie Nuttball,The MuMmy: In-depth Review!,10,4 July 2004,"I am a big fan of mummy movies especially the new MuMmy films. I adore the first MuMmy and I just love The MuMmy Returns! I think the films are great, funny, and just spectacular! In My opinion they are some of the most accurate Egyptian movies out there. The movies are packed with tons of awesome action, tremendous special effects, great acting by all of the actors and actresses who I believe were born to play their roles in both films, great writing and directing by Stephen Sommers, and two of the most astounding scores ever by Jerry Goldsmith and Alan Silvestri! I love the history of ancient Egypt and I think that it is the most extraordinary history next to the time of the Dinosaurs and Prehistoric life! There are so many mysteries of Egypt that no one knows and some of it I believe is so incredible. One day we may find out how the wonders of Egypt were created and why the greatness and beauty of the designs look like the way they do. I believe the entire history means something special. Any way below is an In-depth look at most of the characters in The MuMmy Returns!THE HEROES: Brendan Fraser as Richard O'Connell - This big strong man is a former foreign legion leader and is now married to Evelyn Carnahan who saved his life from being hung by the late Warden Gad Hassan (Omid Djalili) and now has a young boy.

Lock-Nah is part of the occult that is with Imhotep and will Ardeth finally settle the score with his arch-nemesis?

Thanks to spoilers nine years ago and a second resurrection of the creature they now have failed and must fight a battle that is impossible to win!

Now they along with Rick's lovely wife Evy, her good hearted but silly brother, and the brave Ardeth Bey will have the biggest adventure ever!THE VILLAINS:Arnold Vosloo as Lord Imhotep - The high priest was once resurrected and regenerated completely after sucking the life out of gun fighting Americans Mr. Henderson (Stephen Dunham), Mr. Daniels (Corey Johnson), Mr. Burns (Tuc Watkins), and Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain (Jonathan Hyde) nearly a decade ago. His huge dust storm that he created killed Captain Winston Havlock (Bernard Fox). He was also served by the late Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Connor) who betrayed Rick O'Connell. The creature as Ardeth Bey calls this misunderstood phenom was defeated by the O'Connells but now is brought back to life by Baltus Hafez and his secret occult. The reincarnated Anck Su Namun is in cahoots with this very occult and she is the one that led the current curator of the British Museum and his men to the area where the mummy was left buried. Soon they will be reunited and their love will an eternal love. It is the year of the scorpion and the Scorpion King is now superior and for someone to rule Anubis' army they must kill this incredible beast.

Just not a king but he was also an adored leader in battle. He led his Akkadian army of over twenty-thousand warriors against the Sumerian enemy which they too had an army of soldiers in the thousands. This battle between these two unstoppable legions lasted almost a decade. The Akkadians were eventually defeated. Mathayus and what was left of his fallen comrades walked the desert until they fell to their doom. Mathayus, on a sand dune got on his knees and begged the lord of the dead Anubis that if the dark lord would grant him an army to defeat the Sumerians he would give the dog faced one his soul. Anubis agreed and it was right then Mathayus and Anubis made a pact. Mathayus led the nine foot tall Anubis warriors and defeated the enemy. The underworld God then took Mathayus' soul. Though the Scorpion King never met the commanding personality called Imhotep due to them being in two different eras but thousands of years later it would be the year of the scorpion and Mathayus would be more powerful than ever only in a different body form and by a strange coincidence the high priest would return and he too would be super human. The two historic icons would have a meeting of Armageddon!Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep - This man was a high priest, medicine man, and a philosopher. He was an intelligent individual. This handsome man had a relationship in secret with the Pharaoh's wife Anck Su Namun and later murdered her father with the help of his dream lover.

49,johnnyboyz,"The Mummy does indeed return: displeasingly; in what is, frankly, a sequel at the lower end of what is moderately acceptable.",5,14 May 2011,"I rather liked the first Mummy film, I rather liked its knowing attitude towards its rip-roaring and somewhat guilty content; I liked the way it had its characters just walk off into the desert sunset when everything had been said and done. The film's overall framework was satisfyingly closed, evil had been defeated and its undercurrent of romance that the lead and the leading female shared had been introduced as disparate at best; developed and then rounded off in a pleasing manner – if we'd never again seen Rick or Evy or Jonathan, despite how fond of them we'd become by the time The Mummy ended, we'd have been happy. Steven Sommers' 2001 sequel, entitled The Mummy Returns, does precisely what it says on its proverbial tin; the dragging of some of these people back into a firing line of stunts and special effects complete with a few new faces, most of them as unwelcome as the arriving of the film is as a whole and most of the content this time tired and dreary.As with the first, the film begins with a somewhat out of place back-story full of gory and grotesque minor details more broadly linked to a seedier bigger picture around which decrepit acts are unfolding. In the first, two people had an illicit affair which lead to tongues being removed from the mouths of those guilty, and for those whom got off lightly, live mummification; a process one ought to point out is wholly impossible for a duration of longer than about half a second. Here, we observe a great warrior and king in Dwayne Johnson's character, without provocation, gobble down a live scorpion after his power mad but ultimately failed attempts at the conquest of varying kingdoms go array. The reasoning for the arthropodic snack lies in the pact he makes with a war God - the wolfing down of a live scorpion its activation and the first of many instances in which characters do crazy, off-the-cusp things purely to lead us onto greater extents of spectacle driven content. The results allow the now infamous Scorpion King to sweep across most of his land, killing all in his way but arriving with the catch that he won't really be in much of a position to enjoy any of it since his soul is swiped and he is doomed exist cursed. Indeed, the conquest carries with it an air of pointlessness; I guess people were just more aggressive and power hungry way-back-when.Centuries later, in 1933, the O'Connell's, in Fraser 's Rick and Weisz's Evelyn, are back; here complete with a new face in the form of son Alex (Boath) as well as John Hannah's Jonathan who's actually the funniest thing in the film. How we can tell Alex keeps it in the family is in his activation of a number of pillars toppling into one another alá his mother's pratfalls in the library in which she worked during the first. Where they are is an isolated tomb somewhere, the family's introduction as a working unit seeing them intermingle and combine in an array of goofy ways to eventually get whatever job or quest they were initially there for complete. The opening, in its cave chock full of floors of creepy-crawlies is very post-Temple of Doom; the removing of a statuette causing the whole temple to cave in rather sub-Raiders of the Lost Ark. You'd have to be a very stupid person to go into these films not knowing that they owe a great debt to Spielberg's then-trilogy of Jones movies, but this just takes the cake.Evil forces, however, lurk; the bringing about of the High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo), he of the first movie, out of his slumber by a cult its revealed is way out of its own comfort zone kicking off all manner of nastiness – the ultimate goal to resurrect the Scorpion King and steal his armies and power so as to rule over all for once and for all. The film itself is peppered with an array of instances and happenings which do not makes sense, the bulk of it special effects driven masking wafer thin plotting; the troupe of heroes' eventual enlisting of the help of a black hot air balloon pilot a sort of replacement for the firsts' Benni so as to induce a love/hate buddy relationship with Rick just disappointing. On other occasions, the film will branch out into another back story in which that of Evy is involved; her premonitions of being present during ancient Egyptian times and in the company of Imhotep and co. handy for plot conveniences but arrives with the fact the man himself was in her presence and yet has never recognised her – to be fair, I suppose he's had a lot on his mind in the intermingling thousand years. Things lead onto other things; the encountering of some four foot high monsters nearer Johnson's domain puzzling in that they appear deterrents, but why wouldn't The Scorpion King want to be awoken? The Mummy Returns retains the familiarity of the first but lacks the fun, as if Sommers is trying to 'top' material which was never there to be done in any other manner than knowing and self-aware. It is epitomised by the instances of Rick's casual jabs at generic code and convention, which worked with the 1999 first film, but here, is delivered in a flat and disparaging fashion. Sommers is sticking true to what his returning character might say, even though it counteracts with what it is he actually thinks of the material, ie; as something that can be played for something other than smiles and smirks. Flimsey, loose and not nearly as involving nor as fun as the first; Sommers drops the ball with The Mummy Returns, a film which removes the pleasures of the first and mishandles the contexture to produce an effort high on goofiness more than anything.",The Mummy Returns
50,filipemanuelneto,"A good sequel, although not surprising",5,28 April 2016,"In this movie the mummy will return to wake up, this time in London in the thirties. Rick and Evelyn will have to run against the clock in order to save the world again, and most importantly, to save their son, Alex. This is the sequel of ""The Mummy"", movie of 1999, and has the direction and script by Stephen Sommers and the participation of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, added by Patricia Velasquez, Freddie Boath, Dwayne Johnson and Oded Fehr.It's always difficult for a sequel surprising the audience that saw the first film. This film suffers from this difficulty and therefore couldn't surprise the same way as the first one. The script could also have been more interesting: the ""Scorpion King"" story is hardly convincing and sounds like a sort of publicity for the movie with that name which came out the year after. Dwayne Johnson, in turn, played his role perfectly well: this ""pseudo-actor"" is good for any role where he has to punch four times more than talk. The rest of the cast is perfectly fine, particularly Freddie Boath, who was brilliant in his role, and Arnold Vosloo, who gave his character a psychological depth that he hadn't had the opportunity to show in the first film. The soundtrack continued to be good without being exceptional, the special effects and make-up continued to make their role positively but without surprises. The computerization and digital resources surprised me most at the end of the film, which is very well done.This film comes on the trail of a great movie for the family and for almost all ages. I believe that, despite not having been exactly a surprise to the public, this shouldn't be a big sin. It remains a film made with great care and in an intelligent and humorous way. It's a movie for everyone.",The Mummy Returns
51,TheMovieDiorama,"The Mummy Returns for another sandy CGI adventure, tossing out character development off of the dirigible.",6,30 July 2019,"Bigger is not always better (unless you are a size queen...). Clearly, both Sommers and the ancient pharaohs failed to capitalise on this ethos, with colossal pyramids, temples and undead armies towering over the O'Connell's. Yet despite the plague of special effects that have tainted the lands of Egypt, turning it into an outdated polygonal desert, this is still an incredibly enjoyable adventure flick that harks back to the 'Indiana Jones' era of films. I miss those days! After activating the Bracelet of Anubis, the O'Connell's must prevent a newly resurrected Imhotep from slaying the Scorpion King, granting him control over Anubis' army.Right, let's address the camel in the oasis. The Scorpion King. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Merging into one. It looked abhorrently terrible back in '01 and I can damn well guarantee you it still looks like the dark side of Anubis' buttocks today. That is just one example of various ""revolutionary"" special effects that either look out of place or are atrociously rendered. Some, mostly environmental details, still hold up well. Most, do not. So to align the film's focus on haphazard visuals rather than the characters themselves, well, it makes for light entertainment at best. There are some droplets of personable qualities, especially with Rick and Evelyn, but with a large array of returning and new characters, it was just too much. Too many travellers in this desert, y'know what I mean!Regardless, Sommers is able to keep the narrative flowing and showcase a plethora of set pieces that are sure to bring some excitement, even if certain sub-plots like Anck-Su-Namun's reincarnation are underdeveloped. Whether it be a barrage of mummified pygmies killing everyone or a car chase in downtown London, it's always kept brisk and enjoyable. The cast does not need any dusting, with them all performing adequately (damn I miss Fraser...). And Silvestri's score is a definite highlight, enhancing that enjoyable nature even further.Substituting the horror found in its predecessor for a straight up adventure flick was probably the best move Sommers could make, but more attention to the characters was needed to truly add that much required Egyptian spice.

Remember claymation? *coughs* lame *coughs*Now that I've said that, the story line was FUN, the characters were endearing, well presented and developed, and the direction was wonderful. I loved the cinematography quality of this production.As sequels go, this one picks up a few years from the end of the first, and while we, the viewers have missed a lot, there is not so much that we feel left out or completely out of the loop.Evie and Rick are now married and have an eight year old son. The Bamebridge Scholars are no longer turning Evie away, but are after her to work with them now, though she prefers the field.In the field, they discover the Bracelet of Annubis, and their precocious child slips it on. MISTAKE!I won't detail what happens after that. I LOVE this movie, the imagery scenes and sets. Absolutely wonderful production reminiscent of the Indiana Jones days. Everything was wonderful except for the horrible CGI treatment given to the Scorpion King. That really was awful!It gets an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Mummy Returns
55,elshikh4,When The Exaggeration is Scarier than The Mummy !,6,8 February 2008,"The morning after (The Mummy) was released, its producers at (Universal) phoned its director (Stephen Sommers) asking him: ""We need another one!"". And the rest is history.. and foolishness as well!It's not that bad. On the contrary, the talented and diligent (Sommers), as its writer / director, tried to make it bigger and louder than the first one, achieving dazzling image and hot pace, creating a vivacious comic book. However, while the first movie was a lesson in how to make a pure cinematic adventure full of action, thrill, comedy and imagination to the extreme, this one exceeded the extreme; and that was a problem!Script wise, it was crowded. The long flashback in the movie's middle hindered the flow, there were too many storylines, and the dramatic logic of the whole thing was flimsy; for instances: who is that modern girl with the soul of a ""Anck Su Namun""?, how ""Imhotep"" did get his life back after being mortal in the first one?, how the scorpion king will destroy the world?!, and why did the god of evil betray him in the first place?! It's clear that (Sommers) wanted rich conflict, but leaning to fabrication made it unconvincing, if not dull.The CGI was hasty and embarrassingly needy sometimes. I believe its aspiration was more than the movie's abilities. And you can see that in the visual momentum of the climactic sequences.The outcome was a cross between (Indiana Jones) movies & (The Lost World - 1997), however heavy, vociferous, and a little poor. I know that I got a headache because of it! Unlike (The Mummy - 1999) which's close to iconic ""B"" movie, and still that young and entertaining--this one is less cohesive, less strong, and its impressiveness fades away after the watching, and lessens as time goes by.The Mummy Returns is partly fun, but idiotically exaggerated. At times, trying to be bigger and louder produces something inflated and frail. Yes, exaggeration can be horrific, more horrific than the mummy or Universal monsters combined!",The Mummy Returns
56,generationofswine,An Honest Review,8,26 November 2016,"And what happened? The Mummy Returns is far from a bad flick. It is still a massively entertaining adventure, but it just seems...odd? Here there be mysteries...but don't worry you don't have to see the first one to really understand the second. It's not that type of movie.But it is challenging. It challenges you to get past the...well, let me bring you up to speed.Fraser the foolhardy adventurer and Weisz the lost in her own world Archaeologist got together in the first film and are still together in the second, only now it's been a few years and they have a little kid.Hannah is still around playing the brother and black sheep of the family. Vosloo is still the mummy. Fehr is still the guardian of whatever society and the bulk of the film still takes place in Egypt.But it is challenging. It challenges you to keep up with the inconsistencies. Honestly, they are just pulling plot points out of hammer-space in this one. They are adding backstories that would have been insanely relevant in the first film had they thought they were going to make a sequel......but they didn't and rather than writing a follow-up that would stay consistent film they threw caution to the wind and opted to just make everything up and hope the audience went along with it.And we did.Because, let's face it, it's not exactly Shakespeare. We weren't expecting Richard the II. Honestly, if you can't follow it, you have an IQ below 80 and if the blatant inconsistencies upset you so much you can't get around them than you are taking life way too seriously for your own good.This is a popcorn popper. This is a soda sucker. This is a sit down in your chair and enjoy the campy-fun ride.The audience walked into The Mummy Returns expecting an adventure film that delivered action and humor and that is exactly what they got.The bottom line is that, despite its massive flaws, The Mummy Returns is still entertaining and that is all it is, Entertainment. Capital E there.If you want a heady work of cinematic brilliance...well, you shouldn't be watching this. This movie had one job and it pulled it off soundly.",The Mummy Returns
57,dfranzen70,Step-Mummy: more bark than bite,8,19 May 2001,"Set 10 years after the first film, this Mummy finds our Hero Rick (Brendan Fraser) and our Heroine Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) back to their old adventuring, excavating ways. And with them as always is Evelyn's brother Jonathan (John Hanna), who acts as the film's Comic Relief. But there's a newcomer: the 8-year-old son of Rick and Evelyn, Alex (Freddie Boath). The gang's brought back into more hair-raising experiences when a dig unearths a rather cool-looking chest that contains a sacred bracelet. Naturally, once the family gets back home to London, the first thing the little imp Alex wants to do is open it. And put the bracelet on. Turns out that whoever wears the bracelet is shown a series of famous pyramids, and only by going to each one in succession can he or she know what the next destination is. What's the point, you ask? Well, at the end of this whole thing our old buddy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is gonna defeat the Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson) and take the king's army and conquer the world. I know, it sounds like Steven Somers (who wrote and directed) has been reading too many comic books. But this is the kind of movie that you don't examine too closely, at least not the plot.  The point is simply that there's an adventure afoot, and it's up to Our Hero to save the day.Rick, Evelyn, Jonathan, and Alex, joined by Ardeth Bay, the protectorate from the first film, encounter a series of mind-boggling special effects, all wonderfully done on someone's computer. Hey, don't get me wrong, they look real neat, like that giant waterfall and those freaky pygmy skeletons. The problem is that they're all stolen from other movies! The waterfall is a simple ripoff of the last Mummy movie, and the skeletons look a lot like the little demons in Gremlins. One fatal mistake the movie makes is in introducing the typical Annoying Little Kid. This is what singlehandedly sunk another wonderful movie, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989) had a then-very-young Sarah Polley, and this one has the aforementioned Freddie Boath. Both actors speak with a thick Cockney accent and both have a tendency to get into mischief. But you know that all credibility is tossed kicking and screaming out the window when, in the very first scene, Rick and Evelyn bring little Alex to a spooky temple in their search for this chest, and wouldn't ya know it, they leave HIM out by the entrance. ""Stay here,"" they tell him. What kind of a parent brings their kid to a place like that? Ok, ok, I know it's a movie, but there was simply no reason to have this kid in the movie. He may be a good actor, but the character was unnecessary, unwieldy, and unlikeable. He was also a bit like young Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars, only not as cool. Now Alex had a few good lines and generally acquitted himself nicely, but he was more of a liability than an asset. If anyone should have played the role of buffoon and put the bracelet on (thus incurring all sorts of supernatural wrath), it should have been Jonathan, who was a wonderful surprise from the first. But alas, as is sometimes the case with casting people, they fall in love with cute little kids. Bah!Don't make the mistake I made and overexamine the movie. I saw some really dumb things, but most of them are inconsequential. There's one I'd like to point out, however: Rick, Jonathan, Ardeth, and Alex are running from the front of the outside of their house around to the side, where their car is. They RUN around the corner, and then the next shot shows them slowing down to a slow walk. Why? So they can discuss what's happened, what they're going to do, and so forth. Never mind that Evelyn's been kidnapped. Never mind that they were all frantic not 1 second ago, and suddenly when they go around the corner, they have time to chat? Sheesh! Such stupidity! Such bad editing!This very poor man's Indiana Jones isn't terribly inventive, even in its special effects, but it still is roundly entertaining. You could do far worse for two and a half hours.",The Mummy Returns

Unfortunately Returns isn't always at its best. Setting the bulk of the first act in London gives it some aesthetic diversity, and I actually found the two action scenes there (One in the O'Connell's house, the other on a double-decker bus) to be my favorites in the movie. I also preferred Alan Silverstri's rip-roarin' action score to Jerry Goldsmith's from the original. But unfortunately the titular Mummy doesn't loom as large here, and with the Scorpion King not showing up until the last few minutes, Imhotep's minions aren't nearly enough to make up for it.Despite inserting a spunky kid (Will Hollywood never learn?), a clunky middle act and some absolutely cringeworthy CGI in the finale, The Mummy Returns unwraps enough fun to satisfy.",The Mummy Returns

Whilst on another one of their archaeological digs they come across the bracelet of Anubis and return it back to their London home. In the meantime another team of explorers find Imhotep's body and raise him from the dead and this team of explorers need this bracelet to control The Scorpion King's army and take over the world. Rick and his team must do everything in their power to stop this rival faction acquiring the bracelet and must once again try to destroy Imhotep.The Mummy Returns shares a lot of the same qualities as the first film; the tongue-in-cheek humour, goofy charm, and once again the tone is fairly light-hearted and fun. As with the first film, the story is fairly well-paced and moved along fairly well - the only aspect of the story that I wasn't totally impressed with was Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun's romance which was overused and given a little more focus than I felt was necessary.The performances were pretty good once again; although the chemistry that Weisz and Fraser shared here wasn't quite as good as it was in the first film - maybe having them as a married couple in this film may have subdued it somewhat. As Alex, Freddie Booth gives a cheeky and fun performance and to his credit he didn't cross that fine line between being funny and annoying which was nice to see. John Hannah was good value here, although again I didn't think he was quite as funny in the second film as he was in the first film.The only real problem I had with this film lay with the Scorpion King's arrival at the end.... Having seen the real Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson at the start of the film I fully expected to see the real Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson at the end of the film. However, when he does arrive rather than being Dwayne Johnson what we actually get is some kind of horrendous CGI creation of Dwayne Johnson. Why did the filmmakers feel that it was necessary to CGI Dwayne Johnson??? Couldn't they have just superimposed a scorpion's tail and claws/pincers on to his body? I can't imagine that this decision will have gone down well with his fans and I'm sure that the real Dwayne Johnson could have been used at the end as the Scorpion King with some kind of computer wizardry. Personally I thought it just looked naff and it made what should have been a tense final battle look laughable... Imhotep's cowardice at the end only made matters worse. Had the CGI been good then I might have let it slide, but it looked awful and was a misstep in my opinion.Fortunately, a lot of the fun that was present in the first film is present here which, like the first film, makes this sequel watchable. However, the CGI Dwayne Johnson Scorpion King at the end was awful and almost ruined this film for me, but the key word here is almost.",The Mummy Returns

This time the protagonist has to fight with two antagonists Imhotep and Scorpion king as both of them wanted to conquer the world.The plot of the movie is quite similar to it's first part with some addition of few characters. The execution of the plot is good, entertaining and funny but still the movie isn't been able to match the level of it's first part.Acting is good and almost all the characters were impressive with John Hannah again taking the responsibility of humour, Freddie Boath was surprisingly great.Screenplay of the movie is majorly predictable but is fast paced and will keep you engaged most of the time in the movie with the periodically funny scenes and some decent one liners..

This movie is a very worthy and fun to watch sequel. The actors all hold their own in throughout the film and do a wonderful job at portraying their roles. Brendan Frasier does a great job in the action sequences along side Rachel Weisz. The new characters are very well put together as well. I really enjoyed the villains in this movie, especially the scorpion King, played by the very well cast Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He truly is perfect for the role of the scorpion King, tough, muscular, good looking, and able to do the hardcore action adventure scenes true justice. On to The special effects. The special effects are very well done in this flick, very cool and realistic looking, well for the most part that is, there is one scene at the end where the special effects are actually pretty bad looking. The end part where the scorpion King is resurrected, the cgi in that scene is very poor, but that's the only bad part with the special effects, the rest are great!

63,TOMNEL,"Entertaining, but very, very messy.",4,31 July 2008,"If you're thrilled by amusing one liners and nonstop special effects of all kinds of weird creatures, then you're sure to enjoy this second Mummy picture. If not, you will probably turn it off after a few minutes. The first Mummy picture was quite good, in that it managed to fit in characters and plot amongst the big budget special effects. The first picture showed that Universal movie monsters could easily be remade into big budget, special effect extravaganzas, and still be good. Everything I liked about the first movie (minus the characters) was overdone to the extreme here, and about halfway through or earlier, I found myself loathing this picture. The overall feeling though was not one of hatred...this is just an overplotted mess, with moderate entertainment value throughout.Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is back, nine years after the first movie (I thought it was two, but whatever), and he and Evelyn (Racchel Weisz) are married and have an 8 year old kid, Alex (Freddie Boath). Imhotep's (Arnold Vosloo) mummy has been brought back to life, and he wants the bracelet of immortality, which is now in the hands of Rick and company. The bracelet controls the Scorpion King's (played in a pointless cameo by the Rock) army, which consists of easy to defeat dogs who with one hit turn to sand. Chaos ensues throughout.If you aren't paying attention in this movie, or you miss the first ten minutes, you will be extremely confused. Heck, you could be paying attention the whole movie and still be confused. So much is going on, and so many special effects and new plot lines are shoved in your face way too often. Special effects on the mummies and creatures are pretty cool, but the bigger effects are just a huge headache, and they look very artificial. The plot is virtually nonexistent. I guess there are several plot lines, but in between them are many sidetracked scenes, and by the end, this just feels like a bunch of random scenes shoved together.This movie is full of cutesy moments. I'm unsure as to why a mummy movie needs any cutesy moments, but since this is meant for families, writer and director Stephen Sommers made this both violent and cutesy and comedic, so it never fully works as anything (though it does work much better as an action movie than anything else). Jonathan (John Hannah) provides many of the movies cringe worthy lines. He's one of those characters that is scared to death from anything and everything, and still quips out the bad jokes. Brendan Fraser does the same, but he has a charm he brings to the character, and is one of the few positives of the movie. The kid Alex was a good addition, and for some reason, he felt more mature and developed than most other parts of the movie.Overall, this is a pretty bad movie. It's full of effects that add up to nothing, and characters that do the same. There is some entertainment to be found, but you may find after you finish this, you'll be in desperate need for something intelligent.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 125 mins.

It's also cramming in a lot of really forced and clunky backstory and exposition that they clearly wanted to come back to in more movies, but that never happened.Like I said, it's not awful, it's just kinda average and mediocre, which is a real disappointment.

Stephen Sommers, Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah were back to do the second part of the franchise, this time up against an even more powerful adversary. Parts of the plot are amusingly retrodden from the first part too; and again not much makes or is expected to make sense.The former servant of Anubis the Scorpion King and his vast army have lain dormant for nearly five thousand years biding their time. Young Imhotep would like to control this power, meanwhile the Fraser's are chasing after them all to get back their precocious eight year old son who has been kidnapped by Imhotep, and to fight Evil with Good too of course. It's a swift film with no messing about but favourite bits out of many include the London Bus ride, the boy's journey on the train, the barmy dirigible flight, the race to get to the pyramid before dawn. With this movie it's only the ride that matters - all the way from 3067 BC to AD 1933, not the reason for it. The cgi cartoonery was laid on with a trowel but usually complemented the action even if a bit brutal at times. Fraser and Weisz certainly had a delightful rapport.It only worked because it was the same team on and off the screen - take one part of the jigsaw away and you don't have a jigsaw, witness the later disastrous part three. However I still wish it originally could've been a three-film franchise instead of two, simply because we would've had even more of this pleasantly nonsensical hokum to enjoy all these years later!",The Mummy Returns

69,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Missing Some Things,8,15 January 2012,"After having The Mummy (1999) perform really well at the box office, Universal pictures decided that a sequel HAD to be made. So it was done, and this film plays nice and retains a lot of it's genuine feel but it seems like there are things that were sorely left out. In other words, things were given precedence over other things instead of the other way around. What seemed to get more attention was the aspect of special effects and the characters were left in the dust,...sand whatever. There are just too many scenes that contain so much CGI, that it's difficult for the viewer not to imagine seeing the actors onset with a blue screen surrounding them. All main characters from the first movie are back in this film. Plus there's an add on. Rick O'Connell and Evelyn conceive a child named Alex. And of course to make the screenplay fun they make Alex an energetic brat that loves to be just as adventurous as his mother and father. Nothing like family genes to keep the entertainment high in this franchise. Rachel Weisz looks even more attractive in this film and she's not as klutzy as she was before, which is good for an undead vanquishing mother. Her brother Jonathan still learns nothing in this film and its funny to see him try and do things right and ends up failing. Nothing changes with his character that's for sure. What's doesn't work is how the story involves so many ideas and concepts that it looks like this film could have maybe passed as the first film. Arnold Vosloo returns as Imhotep, the evil, life-absorbing mummy who cares for nothing except his girlfriend and himself. He didn't even care about his high priest that helped him get to where he had to go. Jerk! Adding to this though is a character called the Scorpion King played by Dwayne Johnson seems to take hold of the reigns in the finale of this film. Wasn't this film about Imhotep returning for his own needs? Well yes, but his focus is to gain control of the Scorpion King's army who is not yet destroyed, yada yada yada. So in a sense, no it's not really about him returning. Imhotep's in this film to create a race against the O'Connell family but he's not the important person the O'Connell's need to kill.The special effects of this film really starts to overwhelm its characters when the end of the film approaches. The action sequences are still cool to watch but to see giant armies of dog headed zombies, massive forests surround a pyramid, and the Scorpion King himself is just not convincing enough to be real. I think director Stephen Sommers took a chance with that. Although this film was a success, I think they could have held off on the majority of the CGI. It was almost like Universal was saying, ""Look how much stuff we can cram into this 24 inch screen"",...seriously, you don't have to overload a film with CGI to make it look good. Just look at the first one, it's a perfect example.The title of this film can be somewhat misleading due to the fact that Imhotep is in this film but is utilized only as another plot device. For the most part it keeps all the elements of the first movie the same, but sometimes CGI is all the audience looks at which doesn't make it anymore unrealistic than it already is.",The Mummy Returns

So what can I tell you? Well, the movie isn't as bad as I expected. It's all to clear that the director's first thought wasn't about the script but about the many special effects, but i still quite liked the movie. What made this movie work for me was the humor. Normally this kind of movies takes itself much too serious, there is no place for any joke or funny situation at all. In The Mummy Returns this is different. Thanks to the humor, this movie was very enjoyable, but it is of course the many special effects that make this movie what it is. Don't expect anything real: a mummy coming to life, sucking the life out of people, armies of mythological creatures... will of course never exist in reality, but it certainly was nice to see. I guess it is best to qualify this movie as some excellent way to pass some boring hours on a cold and rainy afternoon.

If you read my review of ""The Mummy"", you know that I love it... It was an action treat with some great scenes, memorable characters and fantastic action.""The Mummy Returns"" is definitely what I would call a 'solid summer sequel', and that implies several things: firstly, it manages to continue the storyline created in the original, maintaining what made the first movie good, whilst taking the story in new directions; secondly, it was smart enough to not abandon too much (ex. we don't mysteriously have characters disappearing between films, as happens in some sequels); and thirdly, it steps up the action and adventurous aspects of the original.I will say, it does fulfill those three requirements, which I feel are necessary for a sequel's success (with few exceptions), though at the same time, I think that writer/director Sommers (who returns, along with most of the cast and crew) could have done a lot more. ""Mummy Returns"" is ultimately what I call a ""dumb-fun"" movie... It is ludicrous, and blatantly stupid at times, but still good in a way.The story also seems a bit more silly and overly-fast-paced this time, only there to serve the often-overdone CG and action. However, Sommers is able to save it from being 'just another bad sequel' by working some of his quirky magic into the story and characters. I will give Sommers that... He can make the most cliché, mundane characters and situations into something special.Rick O'Connell and Evie are back, now married nine years after the original, with a young son, whom is the typical trouble-making young hero you often see in these films. After they discover an ancient bracelet worn by the legendary warrior known only as 'The Scorpion King' (played briefly in a flashback by wrestling superstar The Rock), in a well-done opening action sequence that involves collapsing pillars and flooding water, the story is set in motion.As it turns out, Imhotep, the evil mummy with a grudge against the O'Connells, is back, having been resurrected by some sort of oddball cult that want him to use the bracelet of the Scorpion King to bring the warrior back from the underworld. Once reawakened, Imhotep must slay him, in order to gain control of the unstoppable army of the god Anubis... the army which the Scoprion King once led thousands of years ago after striking a bargain with the Deity. With this army, nothing will be able to stop Imhotep.Along the way, Imhotep kidnaps Alex (the O'Connell's son), after the bracelet permanently latches itself to him to act as a map to a pyramid of gold, where the Scorpion King lies... etc. It is all convoluted to a remarkable degree, yet, somehow still absorbing to an extent. Perhaps it is because we spent so much time with the characters in the original movie and already care about them... Maybe that is why fans were able to let go of the fact it is all so silly, and just enjoy the ride.We get other returning characters, including Evie's brother Johnathan (who has some great moments) and the still cool-as-ever Magi Ardeth Bay. We also get new faces, including a silly blimp-pilot (yes, I said ""blimp pilot), and the reincarnated Anck-Su-Namoon (the love Imhotep died for so many years ago), whom hopes Imhotep can restore her to her former self.But let me just skip all the story and character stuff, and get to the real meat of the movie... the action! This movie is definitely a step-up from the original in terms of sheer volume and velocity of action. From the opening flashback where we see hundreds of warriors battling with a ferocity that would make Peter Jackson blush; to a great Soldier-Mummy battle on a double decker bus; to a fiendishly funny and creepy scene involving two-and-a-half-foot-tall ""Pygmy Mummies"", pretty much anything you could even conceive of for a ""Mummy"" movie is covered, and pulled off near-perfectly.There are a few scenes that feel thrown in just for the heck-of-it, though, including a new riff on the 'sandstorm' sequence from the original (this time with a wall of water) and a flashback to an ancient 'sparring session' between Anck-Su-Namoon and the Pharoh's daughter, but they aren't really bad... Just a little flat when compared to the other sequences.Also, I must make one comment regarding the final battle... Without giving away too much, I will say that while most of it is fantastic, it also has some exceptionally poor CG work... Though I have since heard this was due to money/time issues. But other than that one knit-pick, it was great.Overall, I would say ""Mummy Returns"" is worth seeing to any fan of action or adventure. While not as good as the original, it is certainly a fun roller-coaster ride that will entertain you...",The Mummy Returns
72,Terryfan,So much that could have been,5,18 October 2015,"If it wasn't for the fact Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was going to be in this movie I might not have bother with it.Mostly for the fact I never seen the first one and I sadly have a bad habit of seeing a sequel before seeing the last film. But after watching this film I don't think I'll see the first one.I mean the one thing I did enjoy about the film was the fight scenes which were good enough to watch the film.Also the setting wasn't that bad at all and some effects work well for the plot.But other than the film just left with so much that could have been. Plus it's never a good idea to promote your movie around one star just to get butts to seats and sell tickets that is never a good idea. Also the movie is graphic even for the rating it got, normally I try to avoid seeing that much in a film plus the acting in the film just feels out of wax I can't recall one good performance from anyone while it does have good actors I just don't think the acting is worth well nor is the plot of the film.

That film is a film like Indiana Jones with the same plot and the same characters. But the kid is an exception. The cinema show us the kids like boys and girls insufferable, but Alex O'Conell is a boy that ""pass more time in the museum that in house"".

75,Maciste_Brother,"Stephen Sommers, undisputed king of schlock!",3,20 April 2004,"THE MUMMY RETURNS is an orgy of actions, noise and cheap special effects that amount to nothing. Stephen Sommers is THE undisputed king of schlock filmmaking. Unlike movies of the past, when schlocky genre films had small budgets to keep them from going over-the-top with their combination of bad taste, unoriginality and complete lack of understanding of what consists of good writing and acting, Stephen Sommers, thanks to uber desperate Universal pictures, works with unlimited amounts of money to bring his super schlocky vision to the big screen. There's nothing restrained or subtle about his style of filmmaking. If Sommers can have 10,000 extras, why not make it 1,000,000 instead, thanks to (overused) CGI. ""More, more, more"" is probably Sommers' motto. The end result is a huge pile of melted processed cheese that has very little to do with Egypt,  mummies or anything else for that matter.The funniest scene in this action/horror/fantasy/romance/special effects (you can add more slashes to it if you want to) orgy is when the four mummies go through the wall of the museum in London. These mummies are so strong that they can actually go through super thick brick walls of a Victorian building and yet the director has Brendan Fraser destroy them with a shotgun. I'm sure that if Brendan would point his shotgun at the brick walls of the museum, that there'd be very little damage to the walls. The whole scene is totally illogical and always makes me laugh out loud. Ah, that kooky Stephen Sommers.If you're in the mood for schlock, THE MUMMY RETURNS (or any other Sommers movies) will satisfy you and then some. But if you're looking for any quality filmmaking, well, you'll be sorely disappointed by it.",The Mummy Returns

But this film certainly isn't a dud. It's a very entertaining film. Like the original, it is never boring. Whatever laughs it aims for only works cause of John Hannah.In the sequel to the 1999 box office hit, The Oconnells(played by Brendan Fraser and Rachael Weiz) have moved on with their lives. Kind of. They still go to tombs and stuff. But now they are married and have a son named Alex. A really annoying child. Probably the worst thing about the sequel.But their lives change once again. When Evy gets kidnapped in the middle of the night. Rick, Alex, Johnathon, and their old friend-ish Adereth go after her. She is taken to a museum where she is forced to unleash the Mummy Imotep(played by Arnold Vosloo). Where he plans to unleash terror yet again.The thing about the sequel that I didn't like as much as the original is that it is annoying. The Oconnell's son is. There are many moments recycled from the original. Such as when Imotep makes his face in the ocean. Or really, if you think about it, the plot alone. Exclude the fact that the plot also involves Evy and Rick looking for their son. So the movie has it's flaws. But it is never boring.

78,Vomitron_G,The Same Cast & Crew Returns,7,22 September 2011,"When you look at what Stephen Sommers first ""The Mummy"" movie delivered, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a perfectly acceptable sequel. We get more adventure, more action and more cartoonish horror. A blend that simply manages to entertain in an unpretentious fashion with nothing more to it. Even more so than the first film was, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a CGI/SFX oozing fest in the adventurous vein of the legendary ""Indiana Jones"" movies. Only with mummies and other fantastic shenanigans this time. It's big budget summer blockbuster fun, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. The same cast & crew returns and delivers the goods a second time. By now Fraser & Weisz's characters have a kid, so you'll just have to take him along for the ride. Naturally, this also means that the film is intended for a very wide target audience, so all the violence & horror in this film is virtually bloodless, rather aimed to be enjoyable & spectacular than frightening or gruesome. The two films can easily be watched back-to-back for 4 hours of fast-paced entertainment. Or you can go watch a 90 minutes artfilm instead. The choice is yours.",The Mummy Returns
79,RNMorton,More inane fun,8,20 August 2002,"What can you say? A return to the well with many of the same characters brings mixed results. Fraser and Weisz, now married with child, get caught up in a plot to conquer the world (what else?) involving their old friend Imotep and a new baddie, the Scorpion King, played by cult fave The Rock. If you look at it as a cartoon strip it's easier to take - while much of the dialogue and almost all of the plot are beyond mindless, the special effects and main characters are almost uniformly appealing. Weisz handles her expanded action role very nicely while doing repeated battle with a stunning Velazquez, who also gets a lot more air time. A reserved thumbs-up.",The Mummy Returns
80,TheUnknown837-1,excellent sequel close in quality to the first one,7,8 March 2008,"I have and continue to describe the first ""The Mummy"" as one of the quintessential action-comedy movies of all time. The sequel, featuring the return of the most important cast members, called ""The Mummy Returns"" is a follow-up that is additionally very good, full of intelligence and humor that combines elaborately and with effectiveness, and has its fair share of action sequences and fights of all kinds. Like its predecessor, ""The Mummy Returns"" never gets dull or boring and although it is still just lots of fun, most of it silly fun, is highly entertaining for this reason.Most of the traits that make ""The Mummy Returns"" effective are described in my review of the first ""The Mummy"" so I will not begin to restate them again and just advise readers to check the aforementioned review for my ideas on why I think this film and the one before it are excellent and good enough to be called quintessential action-comedies. ""The Mummy Returns"", in short, is well-paced, full of action, has intelligent and well-acted laughs, a great cast of characters, sword fights, gunfights, fist fights, doesn't become too serious in any of its traits, is not too scary or frightening, and although not as good as the original, is still very fun to watch.",The Mummy Returns
81,PatrynXX,"Fun to watch, but isn't that much original.",8,13 May 2001,"This movie was a slight bit of a let down.  However it was a good sequel to the first Mummy.(SPOILERS possible)minuses Biggest problem is it's homage to the first movie.  Meaning the stupid lets parody the first movie.  Both  Beastmaster and Scream love to do that.  But I think it ruin's some of the fun in this movie.  Whereas it may have been fun (and still is) in the first movie.  This movie it's like, quit wasting are time already. There's also some question in the script writer when O'Connell says this line as they see Imhotep being raised from the dead.  (or something like that) ""You know, if I saw that a couple of years ago, I wouldn't have believed it.""  For some reason I believe 9 some years past.  That couldn't possibly a couple of years.  Oh sure a couple of years ago in our time sure, but it ain't 9 years. O'Connell pretty much is funny as usual. Anck Su Namun is a little more of a b**ch in this movie.  I liked her in the first. Oh mr Mummy/Imhotep is still the victim, tho more of Anck Su Namun than anybody else as she leaves him to die.  Nevermind herself. The Rock is a publicity stunt for the movie The Scorpion King.  He's like barely in here, says less lines than Arnold did in Terminator and was only on for less than 4 min.  Unless you count that crude computer designed Rock-Scorpion creature at the end. And while I still love Evelin, she's become fun loving librarian to miss wonder-bra woman who can kick butt.  Of the two if I'd first seen her, I'd take Miss Librarian any day.  Simply because I love books. And the movie has a little of that rushed lets push the director to get this done feel to it.  (Whats it about May??? anyway?)Now the plusses. Believe me the plusses far outweight the minnuses.  If I've misspelled anything, it's only in rush btw. ;) It's the damn action that got me.  I loved it.  I loved seeing mummies in London.  That was my favourite part.  That Imhotep (Arnold Voosloo) had more screen time.  (Hmmm  great two arnolds in the same review.. oopsy) Some of the movie gets more of that Indiana Jones feel. (not the dog) If you like big grand scene's, you'll love it.  And the little one just has a field day now doesn't he.In the end,  I like the first movie better.  It had a good mix of action and humor.  It's only fault was too much humor. Mummy Returns was the exact opposite.  In that it had too much action to humor mix.  I just hope that on Mummy 3  (not Scorpion King) and if there is one, that they finally find a good formula for this.Cause it was the most fun I've had since Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade.8/10(new thing I'm trying.  Quality is what I believe is how good the movie is not how much I like it.  Which is what I've always done with movies. and Watchable or replay value is a side note.

Stephen Sommers hasn't reached the heights of ""Speed,"" but he hasn't plumbed the depths of ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" either - he makes big dumb movies, for sure, but at least he makes entertaining big dumb movies. Think of him as the American equivalent of Roland Emmerich if Emmerich hadn't shot his bolt after ""Independence Day"" (""Deep Rising"" is everything ""Godzilla"" should have been).""The Mummy Returns,"" the silly but fun sequel to the silly but fun ""The Mummy,"" actually improves on the original in a few aspects, most notably in that Rachel Weisz's Evy has a bit more dimension to her this time with the clumsiness that was a running gag in the first movie passed on as an afterthought to her and Rick's (Brendan Fraser) son; but the story of our heroes having to prevent the unearthed Mummy and his reincarnated love (the fetching Patricia Valezquez) from killing the Scorpion King and using his army to take over the world, all the while racing to keep their son from dying himself, is more than a little flawed in its scripting - where did the new Anck-su-Namun come from, for instance? - and some moments leave a bad taste in the mouth (are we really supposed to laugh at the scene where a hapless underling gets killed by a pygmy and John Hannah's character says ""Sorry!""?).Our heroes' son (played by Spencer Treat Clark, who I honestly thought was a girl in ""Gladiator"" and didn't impress me here either) is another drawback, with attempts to weld his mother's Britishness and his father's wiseacre nature never quite working; and the special effects are uneven, varying from horribly obvious (like the opening battle and the raising of the dead army in the climax) to quite good (like the pygmies and the abyss) - since five effects companies are listed, it's unlikely that Industrial Light and Magic are to blame for all the flaws (and they are definitely credited for the pygmy work). But the movie benefits from action to spare, from its spirited cast (even the Rock in his - let's be honest - cameo as the Scorpion King), and also from Alan Silvestri's excellent score. (A big order of the carnivorous bugs that eat at least one member of the cast should, however, go to whoever put that ghastly song ""Forever May Not Be Long Enough"" over the end credits - the most obvious tack-on pop number since Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting got together for the tune at the end of the '93 version of ""The Three Musketeers."")

83,vip_ebriega,A second look: THE MUMMY RETURNS,9,5 October 2007,"My Take: A ripping old-fashioned adventure with excessive special effects galore, but a lot of fun. Sequels have always been a part in Hollywood entertainment, most especially summer blockbusters. What we have here is a sequel, once again, to a surprise blockbuster hit. The film was THE MUMMY, which became one of the biggest hits in 1999. With more than a million bucks for another movie, writer/director Stephen Sommers is back for THE MUMMY RETURNS, with bigger plans, bigger budget and, of course, bigger special effects.THE MUMMY RETURNS has the usual trappings for a summer movie. Big special effects mainly. This one has more special effects than the first film. We get to see more than just mummies coming to life, or sand taking form of the large gaping face of a monster. This time, director (Sommers) brings out everything his imagination has brought up. The story seemed to be more than a decoration, rather than the special effects, which suddenly turn up as one of the films main target. It has special-effects over story and intelligence, but what do you expect from a summer action movie (a sequel, no less). I enjoyed THE MUMMY RETURNS, like all summer flicks, for what they are.Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back as Rick and Evy, who's out to defend the earth, once again, from the mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who is resurrected to fulfill a prophecy, to slay the legendary Scorpion King (played briefly by The Rock), and gain control of the Army of Anubis and gain full immortality.The film has overtones of a horror story, but really is a big, bustling action movie. Obviously inspired by the INDIANA JONES series, like the first film, this film boasts a lot of daredevil action stunts, some totally unbelievable. A large suspension of disbelief is required, but the action sequences, as are the special effects, are so wildly exciting and silly (embracing the slight absurdity of a n old B-movie serial) that they are simply destined to please the eyes, and that's what they do, in spades.Best of all, it's that great new summer action movie, yet it embraces elements from the past. Like the first movie, it ain't art, but it's a well-written strictly old-fashioned adventure, providing chills, action and a lot of laughs. Sommers and his crew truly understood what the original such a hit. It wasn't a brilliant piece of movie-making, and neither was it a realistic lesson in archeology. It was big-time fun. Though it needed the most skillful special effects money can buy, THE MUMMY RETURNS proves that the good old times of action adventures are not extinct. In a time when very few of these kind of movies are being made, it's nice to see one done right. (and if you ask me, that's everything a long-time fan of INDIANA JONES, like me, could ever ask for). I think THE MUMMY RETURNS is just as good as the original.Sure it's a purely silly action-adventure of B-movie quality. Sure it aspires to be mocked. But that's just it, no matter how silly and overblown this movie is, it never forgets to laugh at itself and just have fun with it. Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",The Mummy Returns
84,jhclues,A Special Effects Extravaganza,7,8 May 2001,"If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably expecting fast paced adventure, non-stop action and a special effects extravaganza with just enough story to keep it all interesting.  And if that's what you're hoping for, you certainly won't be disappointed; because that's exactly what you get in `The Mummy Returns,' written and directed by Stephen Sommers. The story begins in Egypt, where Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) discover an ancient bracelet that had once belonged to a warrior known as `The Scorpion King (The Rock),' who, back in the day, had sold his soul to the god, Anubis, for control of his armies and domination of the world.  Now, it seems, The Scorpion King's resurrection is imminent, and if he succeeds and once again raises the armies of Anubis, he could very well take over or destroy the world.  Followers of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo), however, who are privy to this information as well, decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face The Scorpion King, defeat him, take control of Anubis' armies and conquer the world himself, putting them in control.  But the key to the whole plan lies with who has control of the bracelet at the time of The Scorpion King's resurrection.  And the O'Connells have taken it back home with them to London. 
	So the adventure begins in earnest, moving from Egypt to London, then back again to Egypt.  Along the way, there's plenty of mummies, fighting, and bugs, but very few surprises, except for one scene near the end when something quite unexpected happens.  The story itself gets somewhat lost in the muddle, but it doesn't really matter; plot is fairly insignificant in a movie like this, as long as it maintains at least a thread of credibility and can give the action some context.  And that it does, so all is well and it allows you to get on with what this movie is really all about, which-- simply put-- is having a good time.	With shades of `Indiana Jones' and `Star Wars' abounding, the real success of this movie lies in the fact that it never pretends to be anything other than what it is or what it was meant to be, and that is an entertaining, fun movie.  It's visually explosive, from the sweeping, desert vistas of the converging, battling armies, to the mummies and assorted demons and creatures generously sprinkled throughout.  And the hand-to-hand combat scenes between Evelyn and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) are especially thrilling.  The one element of the film that doesn't seem to work too well has to do with a particular mode of transportation to which the O'Connells must resort upon their return to Egypt, and which ultimately plays a significant part in the outcome of the whole adventure.  It's something that seemingly would have been more appropriate in `The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' or `Peter Pan.'	As far as the performances, suffice to say that the actors involved all do their jobs well; after all, in a movie like this you're not going to find anyone struggling with `The Method.'  Fraser strikes a handsome, heroic pose-- call him a poor man's Indiana Jones-- and Weisz is becoming as Evelyn.  Most importantly, they all walk the walk and talk the talk, and Sommers keeps them on track and wisely avoids allowing any lapses into `camp' or tongue-in-cheek character interpretations, which makes this a solid, fun-filled, action-adventure movie that is what it is.	The supporting cast includes John Hannah (providing some comic relief as Jonathan Carnahan), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lock Nah), Freddie Boath (Alex O'Connell) and Obed Fehr (Ardeth Bay).  As with most sequels, you'll get more out of `The Mummy Returns' if you've seen the original, which had more of a story and, of course, would give you the background of the characters. But even on it's own and taken at face value, this movie is a feast for the senses, and just a lot of good fun.  Just don't go in expecting anything more than what the trailer promises; if you can do that, chances are you're going to enjoy the movie and have a good time.  I rate this one 7/10.",The Mummy Returns
85,SanteeFats,Decent enough,8,6 July 2013,Not as well done as The Mummy but I still really liked it. Rick and Evy are now married with a child. They are living in London in a very nice house. The fight scenes when the bad guys break into the house are very well done. Their kid is taken during the fight. The kid is a major player in this movie. He is smart enough to leave clues for his parents who are following him. The graphics in this movie are just as good as in the first one. I love the little pygmy guardians that wake up when all the people invade the area. They are inspired and funny. The Scorpion King scenes are not even close to the movie that came later. That movie is a good one though.,The Mummy Returns
86,Bob-45,Could Use Tighter Wrapping,6,18 June 2001,"`The Mummy Returns' brings back most, but not all the elements that made `The Mummy' such a hoot; i.e., exotic locales, larger than life characters, genuine humor and breakneck action.  However, suspense, which was not a hot commodity even in the first `Mummy' is TOTALLY absent here.Fortunately, all of the surviving principals are back.  However, Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), the weasel, is sorely missed, and not altogether satisfactorily replaced.  Worse, there are TOO many villains, none of whom are given adequate screen time.  One would certainly wish for more of a contribution by Arnold Vosloo (the mummy).  Rachel Weisz looks incredibly fetching.  However, her ego must have gotten the best of her.  Can you imagine ANYONE explore insect-infested ruins wearing a Wonderbra and supermodel makeup?  Rachel probably couldn't stand how everyone (at least every male) stood up to take notice at Patricia Valazquez first appearance in `The Mummy,' wearing makeup and very little else.  Here Valazquez's most prominent assets are kept discretely tucked in her blouse (at least in the `contemporary' sequences), and she wears no makeup (a decision I am sure was dictated by Weisz).  Weisz needn't have worried.  Inept acting is a turnoff, and Valazquez is laughable in her key contemporary scene with Vosloo.The movie jumps into the action portion of the plot way too quickly, which results in the brief lulls intended to build suspense building tedium instead.  The movie also promises us `The Rock,' who appears only in the flashbacks.  Instead, the `contemporary' climax gives us a phony-looking computer generated scorpion with `The Rock's' features.Even with all its shortcomings, `The Mummy Returns' is one heck of a ride, a worthy, if slightly inferior successor to `The Mummy.'",The Mummy Returns

The film moves faster than the first one (or at least I think so), has plenty of light hearted humor and action sequences to make it fun and it has a cool song at the end by the band LIVE.

88,stamper,A good return,8,7 June 2001,"Well first of all I must say that when I watched this movie, I was not in the movie mood. Not because somebody dragged me to the cinema to see this film, I simply couldn't pull it off to get in the right mood. I mean I would not have gotten into' this movie if I had one of them Last action Hero tickets'. But maybe all that just has me looking at the film a bit more objectively or maybe it just has me seeing some of its flaws better.
First of all I must say that in this film there is an almost uncountable amount of effects, way more than in the first part and I must say that the guy I was watching it with was right when he said: This was almost as full of effects as Star Wars Episode 1. That did no harm in this film though. There were actually only a few things that really did. First of all there is The thing with the message bird' that I think is not correct, for birds can only run messages around if the guy that is supposed to get them stays at one point and one point only. Second of all the (SPOILERS AHEAD???!!!) the figures made of sand by the boy are much too good and pretty and third of all I really dislike two scenes on the air transport. First scene is the Oh I want my son back  weeping' scene and the second is the flashback  falling scene'. It is only the almost falling that bugs me, for the rest it is a great scene. A thing I also disliked is, that I immediately knew Evelyn was going to be resurrected with the book of the dead, after she died (SPOILERS END!!!). Also I thought that the guy who played Jonathan did not do too well some times and really stank, just like the cheering scene of the good guards'.
That is it for the bad parts then (oh wait did I mention that Imotheps lady love was not as pretty as I thought she would be after that first glimpse in The Mummy + Rachel Weisz looked better in the original too). But that's only for shallow people and it is only my opinion and perhaps the only opinion of that kind in the world. Getting to the good stuff, the direction was good, the effects were good, the acting was good (except Jonathan (see above)). There were a couple of good jokes (some even mocking the genre (not quite as much as Scream though)) some of which were very obvious, while others were less (like the one in the beginning with all the scorpions in the mummy filled room). What I really liked though was the great music and the epic, emotional feeling the film sometimes delivered. This is a film that is at no times boring and even though I never really left the seat to become one with the characters, the story and the action I enjoyed this film

But like I said some of the special effects are terrible like the first appearance of the animated Scorpion King, he just looks really bad. Apart from that The Mummy Returns is an hilarious and highly entertaining film. A must for fans of the franchise! A lot of the critics were unkind to this movie but they were missing the point: it's just fun all the way﻿. They only dropped the ball on the CG scorpion king in my opinion. Brilliant movies﻿. I felt my soul freaking escape when I heard Arnold speak Imhotep was my favorite character and still is! What I love about this movie: The Mummy and The Mummy Returns reminds me on The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Both of the movie did had returning cast and they ere both much different dark tone, characters. I think The Mummy Returns copied or borrowed scenes from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This film is set 10 years after the vents on the first movie an ancient legacy of terror is unleashed when the accursed mummy, Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), is resurrected - along with a force even more powerful: The Scorpion King (The Rock). Now, as the fate of all mankind hangs in the balance, Rick O'Connell (Fraser) and his wife Evie (Rachel Weisz) embark on a daring, desperate race to save their son - and the world - from unspeakable evil. I have enjoyed this movie in every way and I love that movie isn't boring but has action and it is set in different locations beside the Egypt. It has action, humor and great performances by the actors in it. In my opinion I think The Mummy is superior and much better than this movie, but this sequel isn't bad either and it is a good summer blockbuster movie. I always enjoy even today when every time I see it. The acting is pretty good, though sometimes things become a little hammy. The writing and directing are also well done, this is like the mini-version of what Indiana Jones could be -- though that may be too big a compliment. The flaws and the problems I have with the film are: the CGI were messed up this time around; it did not meet up with those from the first film! Some characters were in a dark tone this time. The character Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) was really in a dark tone and way, way too hot I really did not like that in the movie. Not that I did not like it, in the movie the past life of Evelyn really confused me, when she was Princess Nefertiri a princess warrior when Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velásquez) killed her father the emperor. Suddenly Evie was a bad ass! Just like Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from The Terminator from a shy girl to a bad ass in sequel. That is why I am saying this movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The special-effects are TERRIBLE! The Scorpion King looks so fake! The army of Anubis looks fake! Everything that had to be inserted digitally comes out terrible. That is the main problems in the film that I had. The last ting I wanna say: when the full force of Anubis' army is bearing down and outnumbered, the Medjai prepare to make their last stand everyone in the theater was cheering up with them when Ardeth Bay screams his line: 'Till Death! Everyone was cheering up for them. As everything was said, I love this movie and everyone did a great job and I love this movie to death! I gave a 9/10 if they wouldn't be any flaws in it or weren't things that bothered me in it.

90,SmileysWorld,He should have stayed where he was.,4,14 October 2001,"I have mentioned before that 9 times out of 10,sequels to great films,such as ""The Mummy"", lead to disappointment and wasted money.I'm afraid this film is no exception.The performances were good,particularly Brendan Fraser,who is really coming into his own as a fine actor,so the problem is not there.This movie suffers from a very weak story line.It's as if they had to dig pretty deep for another story to tell.Another problem I have is with ""The Rock"", or Dwayne Johnson,whichever he prefers to be called.There was so much hype over his appearance in this film,that when you went to the theater,you expected him to play a major role.He was in it for a grand total of 3 minutes,if that long.If that's all we were going to see of him,he didn't deserve that much hype.All in all,it's called ""The Mummy Returns"",but if this is as good a sequel as they were going to do,he should have stayed where he was.",The Mummy Returns
91,fernandoschiavi,"The elements of terror and a good capture of the period from the first film, are completely discarded here. Bigger and fun but does not have the charm as before",6,4 July 2020,"With one foot in the adventurous Spielberg of Indiana Jones, the megalomaniac Stephen Sommers skillfully and unashamedly brought together all the clichés that permeate the most basic of adventure films, whether in the usual conception of good vs. evil. badly, in the inevitable romance between two charismatic protagonists, in the uncompromising epic tone of a production set in exotic environments, and in the technical pomposity to fill and please the public's eyes. Being a bet that was more than right, ""The Mummy"" earned a few million for Universal's coffers, which would inevitably end up generating a following. The producer called Stephen Sommers again, who once again wrote and directed. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Patricia Velásquez would also return by reprising their characters.In London, inside a dark chamber of the British Museum, an old force of terror is about to be reborn. It is 1933, the year of Scorpio. It has been ten years since the brave Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Egyptologist Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) fought for their lives against Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a 3,000-year-old enemy. Now Rick and Evelyn are married and live in London, along with their son, Alex (Freddie Boath), who is eight years old. Several events culminate in the discovery of the resurrected body of Imhotep, thanks to the help of the reincarnation of his beloved from ancient Egypt, Anck-Su-Naman (Patricia Velazquez), who killed and died for him. Thus, the mummy returns to roam the Earth, determined to carry out its search for immortality. However, another force is also at large in the world, the Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson), who was born from the dark rituals of Egyptian mysticism and is even more powerful than Imhotep. When they face each other, the fate of Earth will be in danger and Rick and Evelyn will start a desperate race to save the world from an unspeakable evil and also to rescue Alex from the followers of Imhotep, who took the boy because he, without having a clue, he placed the bracelet of Anubis on his arm, an artifact of incredible power. On this journey they will go to Egypt and enter the Scorpion King's domain. A long time ago this terrible warrior promised his soul to the god Anubis in exchange for military sovereignty. He and his army were frozen in time, in a kind of interval between life and death, but now they are ready to kill again. The King Scorpion has more powers, secrets and strength than the fearsome Imhotep, is full of hatred and should not be disturbed.Sommers established himself as a nostalgic for classic adventure, which, in the midst of his generous production in special effects and grandiose scenarios, seeks to flirt with naivety and disengagement with great ambitions that allow him to flow and breathe organically while entertainment. Anyway, here is again the whole gathering of elements that made the original taste good, improved now by a more experienced director and a cast whose tuning has grown satisfactorily from one film to the next. Of course, Sommers who does not miss the chance to shamelessly reissue the most striking moments of the original production, such as the imposing sandstorm (here taken to the sea) or the climaxes - which involved reading the Book of the Dead, was 'recreated '- and the character who reads the spell, although different from the one who performed the task the first time, gets to be confused with the same symbol - which certainly denotes a certain lack of interest in innovating in the script, even though there are curious twists and turns.In ""The Mummy's Return"", Sommers makes this mistake again by creating an absurd story that serves as a mere excuse for him to portray his heroes facing, in exotic locations, digitally created villains. With this, the director manages to produce a film that entertains the audience for about two hours, but that is promptly forgotten when the lights go on. Films like Return of the Mummy always revolve around ancient curses, human sacrifices and legendary beings that are apparently indestructible. However, the first to recognize the clichés is the story's own hero, Rick, since he is the one who says the above sentence at various moments in the narrative - and this is the characteristic that redeems, at least in part, this production: by insisting on not taking himself seriously, the film ends up conquering the viewer through his humor, which tends to self-parody. Yes, parody: after all, how would you define the reaction of a certain character in this sequel, who, upon discovering what the villain's goals are, exclaims: Ah, the old trick of destroying the world '?
Much more form than content, this was a film that enriched the universe of its predecessor, but even more dumbed down a formula that, honestly, was never smart. The great asset of Return of the Mummy was to bring to the mainstream world in its first film role, still in a completely underdeveloped way, what would be, today, one of the biggest names in the world entertainment industry: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. In charge of playing the Scorpion King, perhaps the greatest warrior Egypt has ever seen, for a few minutes of the film, the character's popularity ended up being so great that the producers thought it best to give him his first film, The Scorpion King.The lack of originality ends up being compensated, however, by the technical values of production. Sommers excels in the action scenes, intense and well-choreographed (there is a sensational duel between two characters), in addition to maintaining their ability to exhibit and explore the grandeur in art direction. Alan Silvestri replaces Jerry Goldsmith well in the composition of the soundtrack and maintains the scale of the production's grandeur. The production has numerous shots involving visual effects, which work in a few scenes, such as the chase of the mummies on a double-decker bus in the heart of 1930s London, but which, in general, aged extremely badly and arrive in several moments to be extremely shameful and regrettable, especially in a production of almost 100 million dollars, in which we can mention the emergence of a forest in the middle of the desert. This same forest being ""sucked"" into a pyramid, the escape of the airship from a water wall connecting its turbo, the extremely artificial look of the local pygmies and, mainly, the scenes that perhaps most people remember in this film, which is the regrettable and shameful CGI of the Scorpion King, amazingly, is one of the main characters in the plot. The most powerful warrior in ancient Egypt, here, seems to have come out of a video game whose lack of budget did not allow it to be finished. Not only the face, but the whole movement of the character takes away all the sense of danger and urgency from the climax of the film, causing laughter and greatly impairing the final experience of those who watch it.Even the elements of terror and a good capture of the period and its classicist features from the first film, are completely discarded here. Becoming just that big-scale action-adventure movie that, while fun, doesn't have the same charm as before. Sommers certainly wanted to adapt new blockbuster rules and please the general public, and he still does not do badly in directing the action that is well shaped and still has matinee elements. Even if you come to opt for generic elements of constant slow motion and quick cuts, with some vexamous visual fuss. ""The Mummy's Return"" is not a film that can be considered bad. He has good times, despite a substantial amount of poorly performed effects along with recycling and repetition of past plots, not to mention some rather stupid and even contradictory decisions to the first film. Arnold Vosloo's Imothep in the first film had the power to control the ten plagues that plagued Egypt, an even smart and cool balcony, and here out of nowhere he apparently has the power to levitate people by hand; climbing walls with your hands; create tsunamis with a gelatinous face of yours; anyway ... he became a perfect villain of the X-Men that the X-Men never had.The film, like the first one, has a good sense of rhythm and never fails to slow down in a way that is always direct to the point of the thread and surprisingly cohesive. And even with the countless new villainous characters and the presence of almost 5 different macguffins, nothing gets confused and everything is quite understandable. In the cast again we have the greatest virtues of production. Brendan Fraser, despite being more of the same, he has a lot of charisma in his Rick, and he nourishes a good chemistry with an always great Rachel Weisz who manages to be the only character to demonstrate a clear evolution from the silly historian character in danger from the first film to a woman who knows how to fight practically everything she sees ahead and her stimulus is in love for her family. And young Freddie Boath completes the family triangle that is certainly the efficient heart of the film. We have more of the same with John Hannah, the clumsy man who manages to function as comic relief as possible, and Oded Fehr with his Ardeth once again fulfilling the quota of the Arab franchise, but without any charisma.The film goes far from having any more essence to make here a perfect continuation of your great and charming first film. Overall, the film ends up working well, as the action sequences are really breathtaking - but when the story comes to an end, the viewer ends up discovering that his 'old friends' remain Indiana Jones, Luke Skywalker and John McClane, not Rick O'Connell or Ardeth Bay. And this is, after all, the big difference between Stephen Sommers and other storytellers: his characters are for immediate consumption, not for a long trip.",The Mummy Returns

While Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, and Oded Fehr do just as great as they did in the first film, they cannot match a superior performance by Rachel Weisz, whose character has really grown up in the 10 years since the original (she is now strong-willed and action packed, unlike her nervous youthful character in the first film). And while I miss Jerry Goldsmith's score from The Mummy, Alan Silvestri is definitely up for the task and produces just as good of a score.

While it may not be a classic, I'm one of the few people who liked it due to the likeable cast, the sets, action sequences, great music from the late Jerry Goldsmith, and atmosphere. Then when I heard that they made two sequels to this, I became interested and watched the former, this one, to see if it would be as good as the first.From what I've got, it's nothing spectacular, but for what it is, this sequel is a guilty pleasure. Ok there are some problems like the story being a carbon copy of the first like some sequels, a few inconsistencies with the script and some of the effects looked great when the film came out in theaters but they don't hold up very well.That being said, everything else stood out fine. The cast is still likeable especially Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo (to those who don't know, kid actor Freddie Boath, who played the son of Brendan Fraser and Rachel Wiesz's characters Rick and Evelyn, chose to audition for this role instead of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's (Sorcerer's in USA) Stone. Which is a shame really, but that's life I guess), the sets are very unique, the action sequences are even better and while Alan Silversti's score may not be as strong as Jerry Goldsmith's in the original, the guy did a serviceable job providing some of the best action music in years.Overall, The Mummy Returns isn't a classic, but it's still a guilty pleasure sequel and to those who haven't seen it yet, check it out!",The Mummy Returns

The sequel should be better, right? Hell, no!! Stephen Sommers, writer and director of the 1999 hit, THE MUMMY brings us THE MUMMY RETURNS, one of the biggest action adventures ever made! Now, let's start by saying that I like this movie. The plot is good. The story is good. Everything is fine! There are a few corny performances, but other than that, everything is good. Except that Sommers did not know how to handle this concept.He got too damn anxious to put a sequel out so he could make more money, that he didn't care what he wrote down for a script. So, no less than five minutes into the movie, the action starts. Then about ten minutes later it stops for about another five minutes and then the action starts again and doesn't stop for the rest of the movie! The action never stops! No one takes a breather, no one even has time to take a leak! There is just so much action, that it eventually becomes boring. Sommers just kept on writing down action. He also started the story in the middle. What did he do? Lose the first five pages of the script? Because the movie starts with the previous film's stars Brendan Fraser and Rachael Weisz in a temple somewhere. Then these guys come along with no notion as to who sent them. Then after that scene is over a couple minutes later, we get to this dig site where people are finding Imhotep's body (with no explanation as to why) and the person behind all of this is Anck-Su-Namn (some Egyptian woman from the first movie who was dead) and there is not explanation as to why she is alive!!

101,Movie-12,"One of the year' worst movies, another mindless special effects extravaganza. * (out of four)",2,4 June 2001,"THE MUMMY RETURNS / (2001) * (out of four)By Blake French:	I can tell you exactly what happened with ""The Mummy Returns."" The filmmakers of ""The Mummy"" were in stitches of the huge success of the first film and quickly had the original actors sign for a sequel. They got the green light based on the box-office grossing of the first film, and probably started shooting before the first draft of the script was complete. The results of this shallow, mind-numbing array of visual effects are ridiculous, frenetic, and spontaneous-one of the year's worst films. It proves when a movie is made with the intentions of grossing a lot of money, it does not provide audiences with much more than visual stimulation.""The Mummy"" was one of the biggest box office hits in 1999, but even that was no cinematic masterpiece. Considering the rule of thumb that the original film is always better than its sequel, my expectations for ""The Mummy Returns"" were not especially high. I expected the same kind of movie, where the plot is simply a clothesline for lots and lots of special effects and high-tech action sequences. I was right on the money, but I never expected the movie to be this horrible. 	 The plot in the original mummy' was kind of interesting-but in ""The Mummy Returns,"" the filmmaker's do not really supply us with a plot-but with a string of incidences that setup for yet another pestering sequel. ""The Mummy Returns"" opens with professional wrestler The Rock playing the Scorpion King, a warrior who trades his soul to a god in exchange for military victory, but becomes frozen in time. Most of the original film's actors reprise their roles; Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and John Hannah as protagonists and Arnold Vosloo as the antagonist. Director and writer Stephen Sommers also returns, with a script created for the sole purpose of making a sequel. 	I will not waste my time with a detailed plot synopsis. The film is much too incompetent for such an explanation. Besides, does the story really matter? If you chose to see this film, it will not be because of a thought-provoking story, or even an interest in the actors, but because it is a big-budget, special effects extravaganza. Many people will see this film-my guess is that they will walk away loving the action and visual effects, but once out of the theater this movie may never account in their minds again. It is forgettable, disposable, recycled junk-and you do not even have to think. Before you see this movie, park your brain outside the theater, you will not be needing it. 	What about the action sequences and special effects? Even that aspect of ""The Mummy Returns"" fails miserably. The action scenes are predictable, superficial, and relentless. Action scenes relieve suspense. In this film, they occupy the tension-free plot. The film never builds for any suspense or momentum. This would not be a major problem if ""The Mummy Returns"" had other redeeming factors-but the whole thing is one extended action sequence. The insignificant exhilaration never stops to take a breath. Watching this movie is just like watching ""The Mummy"" again, but this time we expect every occurrence and see every turn coming from a mile away. The ""Indiana Jones"" similarities become even more obvious. The film also introduces several new horror creatures, including a Scorpion monster so badly created that many audience members laughed at its sheer presence.",The Mummy Returns

There are great scenes in this movie that are different than the first movie but they are the same thematically.The Mummy Returns is an inoffensive sequel and this is not meant as a bad thing. The Mummy Returns is a sequel that does everything that it needs to to please the audience. This is a great movie in both its action scenes, its setup, and production. Although it is not a great movie, it is an incredibly entertaining movie. The movie lacks in its story overall and it feels like a rehash of the first movie.

103,gigan-92,All in All a Decent Sequel,7,23 March 2010,"Two years later and here comes the sequel. So who's ready for even more thrills?? Stephen Sommers once again directs and fans of the first will be pleased. This film seems less horror-like, less dark, and so I don't think it can surpass the first but don't get me wrong it's far from being a dud of a sequel. John Hannah is back!! In fact, all of the actors from the previous film return, much to my delight, although are there a few new characters of course. For one there's a kid in this film, something that worried me a bit at first in the trailers. But he doesn't distract audiences from the really important characters, and so I can live with his existence. Also, the sexy Patricia Vasquez plays a much larger role in this film as Imhotep's re-incarnated girlfriend. The story is a bit longer-feeling but it keeps you interested, the important part.Now, the SFX are outrageously well executed for the most part, but a few things were a tad bit questionable. First off, I love the end battle. It's dramatic, sad, and definitely Sommers-material. But the close-ups of The Rock as the Scorpion King were a bit too, well odd looking. His body didn't seem to blend well if you ask me. Another scene was Imhotep's suicide scene, which is tragic but is almost ruined by the look of this crevice of lost souls or whatever you want to call it. It looked rather unconvincing unfortunately. Pushing those aside, the Anubis army was quite simply stunning.This time around, Alan Silvestri does the score and he does a good enough job, though I find it would've been better if Jerry Goldsmith had returned instead.

104,Bogmeister,Bring That Mummy on Again,6,18 September 2005,"All the key players are back for this more spectacular variation of the new Mummy villain - an Egyptian high priest thousands of years old with many supernatural powers. The first 5 minutes, with the new character The Scorpion King essayed by The Rock, actually outdoes the '99 film right off the bat; everything is more, as is the case with such sequels - about 10%-15% more, like a formula. The box office grosses seem to bear this out - throw in more, and the crowds will come - this out-grossed the '99 movie. But, more what, really? More money spent on the special computer FX? That's it. When commenting on a film such as this, it's more appropriate to focus on 'the ILM guys' - the ones who construct all the fake armies and sprouting foliage out of nowhere. Did they spend the computer money well, is the main question. I suppose so. I'm not a computer FX expert.I am familiar with movies such as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and its own sequels. The '99 Mummy movie was derivative of those adventures and this is a copy of the '99 movie. So all the stuff in the old crypts and hidden tunnels and funky pyramids is very old (no pun intended) by now. The scouring beetles make a brief early appearance and still manage to creep out a bit, but the rest is just a slightly enlarged/expanded take on the menace of the same old Mummy. They advanced the story a few years from the previous movie, indicated by the new son of the two main characters (Fraser & Weisz). And this is the only new element, the threat to the young son, which deviates from the first flic. ""The Scorpion King"" offshoot picture arrived soon after this but what really surprises me about the franchise is that no 3rd Mummy picture has surfaced, yet.

After finding the bracelet of the mythical Scorpion King, they're attacked by villains who are intent on raising Imhotep from the dead (again) so he can kill the Scorpion King and take over the world. Of course, it's up to Rick and Evelyn to stop them.All the characters from the first film in the franchise are back, and they slide into their parts easily. Arnold Vosloo gets to do more with his character, and Patricia Velasquez (who has about 10 times as much screen time as she did in the first film) has a lot of fun acting like Jennifer Lopez's alter-ego. There are a few new characters as well, including young Freddie Boath, who is excellent as Alex. His screen appeal rivals Macauley Culkin at his best. Shaun Parkes is a much better source of comic relief than Kevin J. O'Connor (he's consistently funny, and the dialogue between him and Rick or Jonathan is hilarious). Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is suitably creepy as a new villain and Alun Armstrong is suitably kooky as the ringleader.Stephen Sommers knows how to create an action movie. He creates real characters, not actors who are given different names, and sends them into action scene after action scene. It's a fun and exciting flick, and that's all it tries to be.",The Mummy Returns

Well, the movie isn't as bad as I expected. It's all to clear that the director's first thought wasn't about the script but about the many special effects, but i still quite liked the movie. What made this movie work for me was the humor. Normally this kind of movies takes itself much too serious, there is no place for any joke or funny situation at all. In The Mummy Returns this is different.Thanks to the humor, this movie was very enjoyable, but it is of course the many special effects that make this movie what it is. Don't expect anything real: a mummy coming to life, sucking the life out of people, armies of mythological creatures... will of course never exist in reality, but it certainly was nice to see.I guess it is best to qualify this movie as some excellent way to pass some boring hours on a cold and rainy afternoon.

And is the rare thing, but this movie surpasses its original. For the people that love an adventure movie this is a must watch.Brief: Set 10 years after the first movie, where Imhotep is being resurrected and this time he wanted to rule the world and be immortal. To do so, he have to kidnapped Rick's son who is the chosen one to guide them to the mystical place of Scorpion King pyramid.Though not very accurate nor sophisticated as the previous film, the movie is being substitute with more entertainment and more action, and it was an absolute blast to watch. The story is brilliant and the best part is there has been a characters development and the introduction of the new character adds more freshness to the film.What I like most about this movie is an endless action scenes, that is unlike ""don't talk, just shoot"" kind of movie. This is fun from the beginning till end, though many parts of the movie are over done. What disappoints about this movie is the CGI of Scorpion King, which look absolutely fake and it was one of the worst animation I have ever seen and that really put me off. Why every single animation in the movie is awesome, the most importance character ends up so plastic like.Lastly, it is truly a worthy sequel to the great franchise.Reason To Watch: The Story Continue Brilliantly From The First Movie.Reason Not To: The CGI of Scorpion King is Horrendous.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-).Rate Y/N After Read, Thanks",The Mummy Returns

Brendan Fraser seems to be a pro when it comes to combining action hero moves and comedy delivery.  Arnold Vosloo does his role well as Imhotep, but it seems the focus on him yields to that of the Rock as the Scorpion King. I was impressed by the visual effects, particularly the scene where the oasis springs up around the Scorpion King.  But I must admit that the CGI wasn't perfect all the time.  When the Scorpion King comes out as the monster near the end, the Rock's face looks like it came out of a wrestling video game.

A campy film that doesn't take itself too seriously is OK in my book, but this one is too campy by far.As in the first film, the plot makes no sense, the acting leaves one with no feeling of tension. The additional of a cute kid is not helping, as it did not for ""Blue Brothers 2000"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"".If you're an action movie lover like me, you will be tempted to try this film. But only those with the highest tolerance for letting go and enjoying the wild, stupid rile will enjoy it. And don't take along your SO looking for a romantic comedy.Who should see this film:-- Those who didn't mind the lowbrow but punched-up action in ""Jurassic Park II"", ""The Mummy"", ""The Mask"", ""Batman II"", ""Mars Attacks"", etc.-- Computer graphics afficionados who want to try to figure out how they did all the special effectsI regret I must give ""The Mummy Returns"" a 2 out of 10.",The Mummy Returns

The characters arcs are much more richer this time so to me it adds a lot to the story and script. Brendan Fraser is a good actor, just like I said before his character resembles Indiana Jones, a lot of attitude and sarcasm. Rachael Weisz is gorgeous and a wonderful actress.

Evelyn starts having visions where she pictures herself as this other person back in Egypt before discovering something deep in the caverns of one of their expeditions. The bracelet of Anubis is in the hands of the O'Connell's.In another part of London, Blatus Hafez (Alun Armstrong) has his own agenda where he wants to raise Prince Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) back from the dead to awake the Scorpion King (The Rock) and unleash hell all over the world. Blatus gets help from Meela Nais (Patricia Valesquez) who bares a resemblance to Imhotep's girlfriend Anuk-Su-Namun from the first Mummy movie.Along the way, Alex is kidnapped by Blatus's goons where they believe the parents will give when the bracelet of Anubis is handed by them.John Hannah brings comic relief as Johnathan Caranhan, Evelyn's brother, and gets involve in more action scenes. Oded Fehr returns as Ardeth Bay, the anti-hero from the first movie who plays a much larger role than in the original where he's more of a hero and ally.It's good fun, but it takes too much formula of the original movie from the special effects, including a water chase sequence that looks like the sand chase from the first movie. There's also a character in the film called Izzy where his name sounds like a derivate of Beni just like in the original.

Then, when you consider that the original wasn't all that good to start off with, what you are left with is rather little. The story is so preposterous, it isn't even funny any more.Universal just had to make a sequel for financial reasons, but the filmmakers didn't have any ideas left on how to make one. So they put together whatever came to mind and forged it into a movie hoping that a ton of special effects will make it watchable... It didn't. The result is a mess not even a 5-year old kid will find plausible. This is in my opinion all that 'The Mummy Returns' really is.",The Mummy Returns

But there's another dark force that's about to be set loose, with the name Scorpion King.This was a very entertaining film, but I'm not sure if it's better than the first. It had a lot of cool battle scenes, excellent graphics, and a lot of other cool stuff, but there was something missing. I guess I was just bored with the fact that this film is really nothing new. Still enjoyable.I was surprised with the amount of money this film made this weekend. I thought it would make a good 50 or so million, but 70 million? Damn, that's a lot. I never had to buy a latter ticket showing a film and had to wait in a longass line to see a movie before, so I was surprised that that's what I had to do when I went to see this film.Starts off with the Rock playing the Scorpion King, leading his men to wadge war. Eventually he makes a pact with the god Anubis and all this other crap starts happening. Fast forward into the future and Brendan Fraser's character and his wife, Rachel Weisz, are checking out another tomb. The rest is easy to figure out.It was interesting to see the Rock on the big screen, since I'm so used to seeing him on my little television screen talking and wrestling with a bunch of dumbasses. His acting wasn't as bad as I expected, but he didn't really do or say much anyway. Everytime I saw him in the movie I kept thinking, he's gonna do the eyebrow I know it. It was probably my imagination, but I think I did see him do a little hint of the ""people's eyebrow"" towards the end of the film. Bah, it was probably just my imagination.I liked how they tied the events of the first film into this one. It worked out quite well, and the story was pretty good. What I didn't like was the fact that the whole film was so predictable. There wasn't anything new here. A few scenes reminded me of Indiana Jones, but that was a given. I still enjoyed watching it though.I really liked the huge fight scenes that took place in the movie. Especially the final fight between the two female leads.  They had quite a few of those. The effects were pretty good, except a few smaller scenes that I thought were rather funny because it was obviously computer generated.There weren't any good scares in the film, but we have to remember that this isn't a horror film anyway, so they aren't going for scares.

120,Flagrant-Baronessa,A 'Bad' movie that is fun to watch,7,27 October 2006,"Of all my 200-something reviews here, this proves the most difficult to write. How do you justify a film so overtly poor in all traditional aspects? Maybe you don't  maybe it is enough that I leave you with my titular summary and hope you will have as much fun as I did watching 'The Mummy Returns'.Yet I could not to do this because it is a film that demands some evaluation. First, there are many many things wrong with this Mummy installment: its screenplay is a sketchbook mess with gaping plot holes, it suffers from the sequel-hubris of being 'big, bigger, epic', its one-liners are often wristslashingly cringeworthy, the villain characters are frighteningly flat, the animated pygmies some 2/3s into the movie are a joke, and on that note the CGI is so inexplicably bad that it may actually wound you to watch just five years later (it is bizarrely much worse than in the first Mummy film), and lastly there is an unbearably annoying young-Anakin-like boy  Rick and Evelyn's son  whom is given far too much importance in the story and far too much screen time in the film. In other words, 'The Mummy Returns' is camp of Batman and Robin-like proportions.But my god, it is quite possibly the most well-executed and entertaining camp I have ever seen. Its predecessor 'The Mummy (1999)' proves a wonderful little Indiana Jones romp with a crisp freshness and beautiful settings. 'Returns' is equally sprawling with stunning ancient Egyptian locations and buildings but much of the novelty of the whole premise has regrettably worn off from the first film. It therefore goes to great lengths to compensate for its sequel-shortcomings by dishing out everything on a larger scale. This means kinetic, dynamic heartstopping action in all kinds of time eras with all kinds of scope. It is also, thanks to this no-nonsense approach, bathed in urgency which means no slow-paced moments to reflect on its quality.The pinnacle of 'The Mummy Returns' success is its characters. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz undoubtedly have a remarkably comedic rapport that was fully showcased when the series kick-started, and is equally engrossing this time around. Although these two are the goldmine of the film, it offers plenty of goodies from the rest of its cast. Oded Fehr and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are excellent and fun to watch in their respective parts, as is the triumvirate of goofy comedic-sidekick-ish badguys with their assigned quirks. It is constantly poised on the brink of silliness, but then, so is Pirates of the Caribbean and the mainstream audience is crazy about that series. I strongly believed that this is a highly underrated film in terms of entertainment value and it is a shame Fraser wasn't showered with awards for his hilarious performance.7 out of 10",The Mummy Returns

122,theshadow908,Not even close to the first film,6,21 June 2006,"The Mummy Returns takes place 9 years after the first film. Rick O'Connell and Evey Carnahan are now married with a 9 year-old son who enjoys exploring as much as they do. Evey has been having strange visions, and it leads her to the discovery of a bracelet that once belonged to the legendary Scorpion King. When her son accidentally puts it on, an evil cult kidnaps him to revive the Scorpion King. Meanwhile, they've already raised Imhotep from the grave once again, and it's up to the O'Connells and Evey's brother John to stop the mummy and find their son. This is a pretty fun popcorn movie, but it lacks the same charm the first film had.The plot to this movie is okay, but it's just not the same as the first one. Too many ridiculous plot devices have been added to make the movie more meaningful, but it fails. For instance, we find out that Evey is a reincarnation of Nefirtiri, a rival of Anck Su Namun in ancient Egypt. This leads to a fight between Evey and a reincarnation of Anck Su Namun near the end of the movie. Wait...Where was this reincarnation of Anck Su Namun in the first film when he needed her? Whatever. There is an action scene involving a bunch of pygmy mummies, and it is one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie. The character of the Scorpion King was majorly hyped up in the trailers and through word of mouth, but the sad part is that The Rock appears as the Scorpion King for about 5 minutes at the beginning. The movie also uses a couple of the same scenes, such as pillars falling like dominoes instead of bookshelves, and a wall of water chasing a boat rather than a wall of sand chasing a plane. The special effects are terrible as well. The Scorpion King appears at the end of the movie as well, but as a CGI effect so bad, it looks like an N64 video game character.Thankfully, the acting is just as good as the first film. Brandon Fraser and Rachel Weisz are great as a couple, and John Hannah is once again hilarious as Evey's brother. Arnold Vosloo plays the mummy once again, and does a good job, but sadly, due to everything else that's going on in the film, the mummy's return receives the least attention.Overall this is a fun popcorn movie, but nowhere close to as good as the first movie.6/10",The Mummy Returns

This one spent much more time and effort on big-budget special effects than character development or humor.  This film needed a Benny.The hot-air balloon idea was contrived, badly written, and poorly animated. The character of Izzy just isn't filled in enough, and that IS a writing problem, not an acting problem.  The movie feels like it was thrown together, re-written by a half-dozen studio executives who wanted to mix the original with ""The Matrix"" and remove everything intelligent.  I liked the characters in the first film quite a bit.  I missed them.  And other than faint glimpses of the original Rick, and even fainter ones of Evie (more of which are shown via Alex than Rachel Weisz), they're not here at all.  Great actors given nothing to do but react to special effects, as opposed to (as in the first one) each other.A good idea squandered-- I liked it, but any director is likely to be surrounded by Yes-men after a success like the original ""Mummy.""Worth watching once.

129,rollernerd,Scorpio Year,8,29 October 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Greetings from the dark...tonight's movie review is The Mummy Returns (2001), where the director and the gang are back to fight old Imhotep who is revived once more to tackle the Scorpion King in order to gain control of the dead army to rule universe. Now pretty much the first film is definitely of my all-time favourites - top 100 potential right...so this sequel needed to live up the any expectation I had. Guess what? It did. Now the CGI in this film - its too much, like when we see the Scorpion King, played by the Rock and the undead army of Anubis, it was not the best-looking CGI. Granted this was the early 2000s but they could've used practical effects to make the film more appealing. Having said that, the film is heaps of fun, chockers of mummies and action adventure. We have Ardeth Bay finally playing sword buckling with his nemesis Lok-Na. We have Brendan Fraser's character Rick O'Connell playing best father and husband of the year. Honestly this actor steal the show again - his comedic timing and his action sequences or having a gun in one hand and a fire torch in another whilst walking through cobwebs and scorpions makes you wonder, where is this guy?The story is more complicated in this flick, which makes you question and relate to the first film. For example, Rachel Weisz character, Evelyn, who has evolved in more confident and more on the edge taking risks character in comparison to what she was in the first flick. And she is finally accepted or should I say getting poached by the Beveridge scholars. In the flick though there is something new about her - we are to believe she is the reincarnation of an Egyptian princess. Not only that, Rick is her guardian after the filmmakers decide that Rick always had cartouche - a bizarre tattoo on his wrist indicating he is a ""protector of man."" There is another reincarnated character, Anck-Su-Namun played by the stunning Patricia Valazquez, who has more of a role here. I guess the whole reincarnation plot describes how the major characters are to finalise their own destiny.There are new characters including Jacques the French bloke who believes everything is cursed and Izzy the hot air balloon pilot who has a keen eye on a sceptre and doesn't like to get shot. Another new character is a kid called Alex, that's right the son of Rick and Evelyn who in his second scene does a throwback to his mother's domino affect sequence. His onscreen scenes with his uncle Johnathon are hilarious. Going back to Fraser, in this sequel, he plays more of a voice of reason which is a good balance with Weisz character. However again those comedic timings are spot on, for example he uses the following words on point to make you gee up ""you lighten up, you BIG trouble, you get in the car.""The film moves a lot quicker and given how the first film ended with Imhotep being dragged back down into hell and his powers taken, I would have liked to have known how it was so easy to bring him back with his powers and also why he doesn't seem surprised to be back??? But it's not meant to be taken as a serious film, it's a popcorn flick. The action sequences are great, whether it was at the O'Connell's house, the showdown of mummies on a double decker bus in London and to the Medjai (sooo close to Jedi) fighting the armies of Anubis. Plus who wouldn't like to see mummified pygmy warriors in the forest - funny, especially the log scene.Overall, the movie is great fun, but not as coherent as the first film and very questionable CGI, however if you like gang from the first then by all means watch this sequel - 8/10.",The Mummy Returns

Mainly, I feel that the film focuses too much on the action rather than the horror that the first one created. However, the action sequences were satisfying, from the bus sequence, to the final battle between the Medjai and the armies of Anubis. Even though Arnold Vosloo still maintains his portrayal of power, he loses some of that original power as the danger and importance of his role is replaced with the race against time to stop the Scorpion King from being awaken. Overall, although I enjoyed most of the performances, like Fraser and Weisz, I feel that while it's enjoyable and is re-watchable, for me, its only the action sequences that make this worth returning to, rather than the characters, horror and the few yet strong battle scenes from the first film.",The Mummy Returns

136,HenryHextonEsq,A breakneck ride into rudderless inanity.,4,12 July 2001,"This ""film"" was really more of a scattershot exercise in pointless, mindless visual excess and absurd bombast. Rarely does it ordain to slow down and focus on character, motivation or theme. When such attempts are made, they are outright laughable. At times, early in this picture, the breakneck pace, absurdly wafer-thin awestruck dialogue and farcical bouts of violence, do amuse in an admittedly mindless way, but as the movie progresses, such hilarity (presumably unintentional for the most part) is harder and harder to find. It frankly descends into what is literally a barrage of pointless, scampering special effects-endowed images. The characters are scant, of course, with the actors probably better, but failing to truly rise above the material. The best that can be said about the child actor is that he is less inappropriate than the one in ""Enemy at the Gates"". Fraser, and certainly Weisz fail to truly characterize. Fraser is tolerable, and at times comically adept, but presumably is wasted in this film. John Hannah is relatively effective in the film's context, but the character is rather a tired stereotype. The least said about plot and script the better. Oh, and The Rock? A pointless appearance in keeping with the arbitrary ""qualities"" of the film. It is indeed no ""Citizen Kane"", and folks, it is yet another film that makes one wish more mainstream producers, studios and directors at least aimed for the vision and entertainment offered by the man Welles.

137,dcldan,Better than the first,7,14 February 2006,"This time, Stephen Sommers has forgotten the terror to film a pure adventure film, in the same way as Indiana Jones, with exoticism, adventures, dangers, and of course, good sense of humour, all mixed with spectacular special effects. The reincarnation of Ank-sun-ammun awakes the Mummy again, Inmhotep must fight with the Scorpion King in order to command his army a nd conquer the world. In this way, he will be able to enjoy his life with his lover forever. Unfortunately, this will mean the end for humans, so the O'Conells have to stop him. With a great sense of humour and adventure it is better indeed than the previous part, better special effects, and less terror,which makes the film better. All actors are great (for this kind of film) specially Voosloo, who makes the Mummy the most charismatic character of the film. On the other hand, the charisma of the characters of inmhotep and Ank-sun-amun is greater than the time they have in the film, the director could have taken more profit of their spectacular and precious love story to make the film more enjoyable; this guides us to another question: If the Mummy only wanted to be with his lover, why should he do all this mess to command Anubis Army, could he simply stay happily with her?? The film is funny and enjoyable, despite some things (as said before) that could have been filmed better. Ideal for enjoy during 2 hours with one of the best modern classical adventures film.",The Mummy Returns
138,carlos37andre,The last 30 minutes of the movie are amazing (for all the wrong reasons),5,7 June 2020,"I have fun watching the movie, again. I think that, funny enough, here you feel more the dated CGI than in the 1999 film (cof cof Scorpion King cof cof). I'm totally analyzing this movie through a whole different perspective tho.First, the good stuff. I like the first 1/3 of the movie for real, the scenes in the tombs and in London are cool, some good scenes, and that fight with the Mummy on the bus is great. I like Evelyn a whole lot more this time around, she is a badass, even though I still not shipping them as a couple. She at least isn't totally helpless.Again, Fraser is great as the lead. And at first, I didn't like the kid, but afterwards I loved his chemistry with his uncle. The movie definitely goes for a more comic tone than the first one.Right when they meet the balloon guy, the movie lost me a bit. Here we have some truly bad CGI moments (with the night sky, and also the part at the lake with the face). And man, that whole Evelyn is actually a reincarnation too was horrible. This and the whole ""I have a tattoo that says something"" stuff with Rick is just bad, and used as a reason to tie everything together (but did we really need this?). The next 1/3 of the movie lost me again. Also, where was this reincarnation of Anck Su Namun in the first movie? C'mon, don't do that. Everything here goes against what they did in the first movie.The third act tho. My god the third act. I love everything about it (mostly the last 30 minutes). But for all the wrong reasons. Of course, the kid resurrects his mom! Anck Su Namun leaves Imhotep to die lmao. And MY GOD the Scorpion King! I love every minute he's on screen. Is so bad, but so damn entertaining. And of course, who didn't see the ex machina factor coming a mile away at the end?This is by no means a better film than The Mummy (1999), it manages to have some truly awful CGI (and being known for it) even tho it was released 2 years after the original. However, the first 30/40% of the movie are good, the next 30/40% are bad, but the last 20/30% are freaking awesome, the big fight scene with a CGI The Rock against young Brendan Fraser. I can't wait to watch The Scorpion King.",The Mummy Returns
139,wnterstar,A worth while sequel,8,21 April 2006,"I'm not a great fan of sequels usually. They tend to be derivative and just plain stupid.The Mummy Returns did not fall into that trap. It is just as clever as the first. Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weiss reprise their roles as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn Carnahan in the Mummy Returns. This time, they are married and their son has been taken hostage by the newly raised Imotep (brilliantly portrayed by Arnold Vosloo).It is filled with the clever repartee and the cartoonish fights that made the first movie so good. The special effects are terrific and the cinematography leave you wanting to go visit Egypt.OK...It's not great cinema....it's not suppose to be. It is, however a great movie to watch for a night of fun!",The Mummy Returns

The plot is more interesting and it makes sense once you're willing to believe in ancient curses and armies rising up from the sands. We know the characters after the first film and so we care about them. The Izzy character was a nice addition and I liked Ardeth Bay's part here. I actually hated the first mummy but this was twice as cool. The action was simply much more imaginative and the effects were lovely. Who can forget the little nasty pygme's or the Anubis warriors? Those are really great new creatures. The Scorpion King, on the other hand, looked weird and cartoonish. I liked the references to the first film.

143,lyubitelfilmov,But why can't you stop it! or a good continuation of your favorite adventure,8,12 November 2020,"Adventure. Continuation of the film ""The Mummy"" of 1999, and no less beloved by me than the first, because I grew up on it (well, not literally, of course). I remember that if I was sick, then without hesitation I took the remote control from the VCR, took out the cassette with the first and second parts - and enjoyed my favorite adventure for the hundredth time, because both parts occupied me for four hours. And here's my brief opinion - Why can't you stop it! And, despite my love for this painting, I will consider both the pros and cons of this adventure. Then I ask you to brew some tea, cover yourself with a blanket and enjoy.
So the pros:
1. Scenario - the picture is a direct continuation of the first part, and takes place ten years later. The young couple O'Connell had a son, Alex, who became his parents. Everything is as usual - tombs, treasures, ancient secrets. And again, some citizens dug up the unfortunate mummy, which means that the O'Connell couple, like the whole world, have big, no, huge problems. Again chases, fights, shootings, only the geography has expanded a little. Stephen Sommers (screenwriter and director of the first part) had to get out, because the box office was clearly hinting at the continuation of the banquet, and the producers were pressing, so Stephen, using all his resourcefulness, wrote a good script (if you do not go into some of the details below). He was able to survive as much as possible from history, and for that I can praise him. He could make it much worse. Personally, as a child, I enjoyed the story every time, and now the same thing happened.
2. Fights, chases, shootings - there are much more of them, but the quality of the production remains at its best. Dynamics, spectacle, exciting moments, emotions for the characters - everything is there, and not in small quantities. Even the scale was brought (though not without the help of graphics). For a little kid, what I was - the very thing, and even now all this disgrace looks great.
3. Humor - I can't say that all the jokes turned out to be successful, but most worked. After all, there is twice as much humor here, as well as characters who have only one task - to joke, and sometimes be useful. Some of the jokes caused me a real storm of delight.
4. Music - Alan Silvestri himself was invited to write it - a professional in his field, and he really did his best. And the pathos was able to highlight, and humor, and spectacular moments, and even hook the viewer with a drama, the mystery, the atmosphere - it's all about this musical accompaniment, which can be listened to separately from the picture itself.
So the cons:
1. Self-repetitions - I already wrote that Sommers got out of it, and as a result we have self-repetitions of the first part, albeit slightly modified. Frankly, some of them were beaten and it turned out well, but the other one - maybe I won't squeal like an old grandfather in the style of ""it was better before""! Just be ready for it.
2. Bloopers, nonsense, nonsense - there is much more of this here than in the first part, although they try to hide it, throwing fights, chases and shootings at the viewer. I've seen it all many times, but only now it dawned on me how much outright stupidity there was. This is the only reason why I put the final grade below, because I simply cannot ignore them, forgive me.
A little about the main characters:
1. Rick O'Connell performed by Brendan Fraser is a former adventurer and a hero without fear or reproach became a father now, which means that if you touch his son, then you will not expect mercy. Here he again shows himself from the best side. Brendan returned to his usual role - and coped with it perfectly. Bravo!
2. Evelyn (Eevee) Carnahan-O ""Connell performed by Rachel Weisz - from the first shots we are no longer the classic"" lady in trouble "", as it was in the first part - but a mother and a strong woman, ready to do anything to protect her baby. Rachel is charming and sweet here, just like before, but she looks a little tough and fights great. Bravo Rachel! Kisses!
3. Alex O ""Connell performed by Freddie Boat is the son of Rick and Evelyn, who, in addition to a hefty set of knowledge, also possesses inventiveness, resourcefulness and a rather good sense of humor, and Freddie in his years coped with the role of the naughty offspring of adventurers quite well.
Once again, John Hannah joked perfectly in the role of Jonathan and Oded Fehr in the role of Ardeth Bey, and Arnold Vosloo in the role of the restless Imhotep.
Even with an increased budget (almost one hundred million cabbage leaves), the picture not only paid off, but also brought the studio almost half a billion, and again decided to shoot a sequel, expelling Sommers, and releasing it, and in other matters I will tell you the next time I give a speech about the bad ending of this adventure series.
As a result, we have a good sequel to the action adventure movie with Brendan Fraser, a good script (not without blunders and nonsense), with excellent music, and with great acting.",The Mummy Returns
144,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""The Mummy Returns""",6,3 May 2008,"Yet another solid Mummy film. It was rather fun watching this one but it lacks some key elements. They had to use the same villain again who died in the first film, it was bad. He died already, no need to recycle villains. The concept was rather enjoyable and they managed to put a mean looking villain in the embodiment of Mathayus, half man half scorpion.The whole reincarnate angle was unnecessary. The film would have worked a lot better if they left that bit in the cutting room. It is obviously just an excuse so the two smokin' ladies can battle it out with their sais in the end of the film.On a positive note, I can probably say it is a lot better than the first one. The first Mummy is one action scene short than its sequel. This one was bigger than the first in many ways. Here's hoping for a yet more bigger Mummy 3 (Though I don't really dig the fact that there's no more deserts in the third film, its the Mummy. Mummies reside in the vast deserts, not China)",The Mummy Returns
145,gazineo-1,A good adventure for parents and kids,6,28 May 2001,"A very entertaining adventure yarn made in old fashioned style that can please parents and kids. There's a lot of fun action here, good special effects and a plot fantastic and far-fetched but otherwise funny and relentless. This one is a continuation of the Mummy but is surprisingly better. John Hannah is the standout here as the wacko brother - in - law of Fraser. I give this a 6 (six).",The Mummy Returns
146,TuckMN,The very definition of an action/adventure film.,8,29 May 2001,"Even though this film embodies everything that I think is so very wrong with film making today: not much story, too little plot and a reliance on special effects and action instead of talent  I still enjoyed it.It is hard not to get caught up in the whiz-bang exploits and fast paced story that are being told solely for your entertainment  and entertaining it is.It was great that the cast from 1999's `The Mummy' has all returned  As I said in my review for that film `Brendan Fraser is the logical successor to Harrison Ford as the screen's newest action star.'  And he shows he is still probably that successor.It is a real pleasure to watch Rachel Weisz  she is beautiful and she can act  at least as much as the script will allow.Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy/High Priest Imhotep) is fascinating to look at too There is something very compelling about his look and screen presence.  I would like to see more of his work.I did wonder if ""The Rock"" (who know his real name is Dwayne Johnson?) was cast just to pull in a specific demographic...Speaking of demographics:  women consistently liked this film more than men did -- also something that I wondered about.There were many (maybe too many?) sequences where the heroes got away in just the nick of time; after a while it just didn't seem plausible.The sound track became somewhat annoying.  It was over-loud and because I was in an excellent theater with a superb sound system (and almost no audience) there were times when Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) would do something heroic and it sounded like applause had been dubbed into the background.This film borrowed heavily from many, many films  There were scenes that were right out of `Star Wars Episode I:  The Phantom Menace,' `ET: the Extraterrestrial,' `Murder on the Orient Express,' and far too many others to mention.But, going back to my opening paragraph:  I enjoyed it!",The Mummy Returns

Unfortunately, there isn't much plot to the story - Rick and evie's kid gets kidnapped and they try to get him back and that's about it. The kid, like all kids in movies nowadays, is a smart-butt and a real pain. One of the bad guys keeps talking about killing the kid and you find yourself rooting for him to do it.

149,BrickNash,More of the same but the same great quality,9,2 June 2013,"The sequel to the fantastic adventure that was The Mummy was always going to be a tough job. Thankfully the same cast and crew are reunited with writer/director Steven Somers taking the helm once again.The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to top the original but what it does do is offer up more of the same. Same feel, same look, same humour and it all works nicely to bring a sequel that will keep you entertained for an hour or two.It has to be said it's not 'quite' as good as the original. The story takes a strange turn in giving the characters some sort of mystical heritage which is a little odd but works nonetheless. The CGI is the usual standard for a film of this type but again I don't think it is quite as good as the first film.All this is just nitpicking as the plot and story race along very well and all the actors do their parts and look like they are having fun especially the young O'Connell Alex who is a nice addition to the cast.Nothing more can really be said, if you like me loved the first Mummy film then do not hesitate to watch this as it is simply an extension of the quality and will satisfactorily fill your 'more of the same' urge.",The Mummy Returns
150,budmassey,A summer sequel spectacle that exceeds the original!,5,5 May 2001,"Brendan Fraser is the only thing wrong with this movie.  He still hasn't learned to act, but someone at least learned how to handle him.  Give him short and simple lines and let the action support him.  Fraser would do well to emulate another top box office non-actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger and learn to make light of himself.  Think True Lies.  Has Arnold ever been better?Everything else is fantastic.  This film is infinitely better than The Mummy.  There is more story, more drama, more action, more special effects, more of everything.  This time out, evil Archaeologists stage a battle between Imhotep (Vosloo) and the Scorpion King (The Rock) to gain control over the armies of Annubis. Along the way, we get deeper into the story of Anck-su-Namun and Imhotep. A new story line develops that ties Fraser and his new wife, Evie (Rachel Weisz), closer to the ill-fated couple than they could have imagined.  John Hannah, who returns as Evie's hapless brother, and Freddie Boath as her and Fraser's son, add comic relief galore.  Arnold Vosloo is once again fabulous, and I'd love to see him get more good roles.  Patricia Velazquez returns as the other half of the star-crossed lovers, Anck-su-Namun.The movie succeeds at tying the two stories together, and using the first film to raise the stakes.  The much touted Scorpion King role is a bit of a letdown, but the spinoff is already being filmed, without, unfortunately the majority of this cast.  I always thought that The Mummy might have been as good as the Indiana Jones films if Fraser could act.  This movie deals with that problem, and earns its place as a peer with the Indiana Jones trilogy in movie history.  It does everything well.  Even the credits are the best I've ever seen, and the ending song is tasty.A summer sequel spectacle that exceeds the original!",The Mummy Returns
151,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,When you just wish for the heroes to find a gruesome death,4,28 December 2014,"There are a lot of things that aren't that great about this return of the Mummy. The first film was decent fun, this one tries to be more of the same, except it's not very funny, it is loaded with an army of clichés, including my personal most hated one, resurrection, an over-dependence on cgi, convenient and dumb reincarnations, last minute rescues that can't convince a toddler, archaeologists who should be tried for cultural crimes against humanity, etc. However, there is still one good thing at the core. The immortal romance between the bad guys makes up for a lot of these flaws, because a well-built villain is worth a lot. Especially when the good guys are ultra-annoying Brendan Fraser, simply annoying Rachel Weisz, their super-annoying kid and that not even comic relief other guy, while the evil counterparts have the better looks, more acting talent, and a superior backstory. And this is really the biggest problem, since nobody in their right mind could ever be glad for this ""happy"" ending, and no screenwriter can really explain how the woman who traversed time and space to bring back her lover proved to be less loyal than annoying Rachel Weisz was to Brendan Fraser, of all people.",The Mummy Returns

All returning characters are wonderful and have grown in ways faithful to their initial incarnation; and all the new characters are engaging, interesting, and fun. The action sequences are all terrifically well thought out, and the plot is huge and epic and sweeping. It's nice to see a summer film with such grand designs. What makes the film truly excel is the wonderful attention to small details as well as big, and the way multiple storylines are woven together seamlessly. Steven Sommers deservedly has another big hit on his hands. This film raises the bar on Summer 2001. It's doubtful anything will be able to compete on a quality level with this film this summer.",The Mummy Returns
153,atzimo,"OK Sequel, Terrible Visual Effects",1,5 April 2002,"This movie is so packed with CGI that it makes it look like a video game demo. After watching quite a large number of new computer generated movies, it all comes down to this: the effects are good, only if the director is talented enough to make them look real.In my opinion only three artists incorporated computer effects successfully in their movies: Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott and James Cameron. Only these people created movies with heavy use of cgi in the last 10 years that looked real (in fact they looked so real that you didn't even notice them).Apparently for some people computers can give you all the power to create anything visually, without using any of the old days' craftsmanship. 'The Mummy Returns' looks fake, especially at the climax of the movie. When Scorpion King arrived, I was looking for my joystick! Didn't anyone realize that they should combine real shots of the Rock with some cgi?As a story, 'the Mummy Returns' is okay for a sequel, quite inventive at places and with some nice sence of humor. Still, it takes a lot of talent for someone to create the new 'Indiana Jones'.To all directors: Please go back to using miniatures and physical photography. Watch the 1993 Jurassic Park to study what's real. (That goes also for some old timers that return to their saga after 20 years, just to shows us cartoons!)",The Mummy Returns
154,atzimo,"Cartoons, Cartoons, Cartoons...",1,23 May 2002,"What a joke this movie is. The first Mummy was quite alright, with the right dose of suspense, an interesting story, likeable characters and quite subtle visual effects. Not an 'Indiana Jones' in any way, but an enjoyable movie nevertheless.'The Mummy Returns' looks fake from start to finish. Sommers tried to create a sequel that is bigger an better than the first one, but he failed in almost every way.Someone should tell film makers that today's computer technology is not yet able to replace EVERY movie set and definitely it's not ready to replace actors!!This movie includes some of the worst effects ever created by ILM and maybe it's not even their fault. Because it's their job to do what the director wants, so if they were asked to create the Rock as a CGI character, they just had to do it.Of course the result is totally laughable, an embarrassing moment for a movie with such a high budget. Also the moment where the pyramid sucks in all the jungle, is the stupidest, most fake, over-the-top effect I have ever encountered.What the hell was Sommers thinking? ""Ah, that's a nice idea, I'll just ask the ILM guys to do it and we're done"". Well, it looks totally cartoonish and ridiculous.Having recently watched the good old 'Big Trouble in little China', all I have to say is that the rubber monster in no way worst than any of the effects in 'Mummy Returns'. Why? Because principal photography is at least applied on set and can -with the right director- produce a quite realistic result.Listening to the DVD audio commentary by Stephen Sommers, all I can say is that the guy is totally untalented and has no appreciation of art at all. He was just lucky. The people are always hungry for Indiana Jones type of adventures and he was there at the right time. He is under the impression that because his movie sold well, he created something good.Well, this movie has zero suspense, the characters are now unlikeable (except for the always brilliant John Hannah) and everything's totally predictable. Plus, there are so many elements in 'Mummy Returns', you just can't keep track of. Pygmy mummies out of nowhere, flying zeppelin things, projector bracelets, weird reincarnations, among others. It's like having a sandwich with everything on; in the end, you just don't know what you're eating.The script isn't totally bad, but it's loaded with so much useless information that makes the movie hard to watch, even for the sake of the story. I had to listen to the DVD commentary, to realize that the building Eve and Rick return to, is their home and not a museum! What was that?! Who produced this joke of a movie?The humor is good though, I grant Sommers that. Also did you know that the 2-disk set DVD sold ever more that the movie itself? And it's a terrible release too. The second disc was totally unnecessary, it's full of the Rock being interviewed - who cares about him anyway?If they followed a more subtle direction, they could have a good movie. You know, Sommers said that computer guys cannot replace an actor. Well, THEY HAVE REPLACED YOU, Stevie!",The Mummy Returns

156,kergillian,Horrid script ruined a potentially fabulous film!,6,22 May 2001,"As all sequels go, this wasn't as good as the first one. But it was still rather good. And had the potential to be *much* better! I *loved* the continuity from first to second. The continuing fragments of the story are wonderfully inserted here to add a strong feeling of connection between the first and second films. And the characterization continued to be wonderful (and thankfully, they didn't let the Rock act much;)But that said, there were many aspects that just plain ruined an otherwise clever story. The romance was just plain horrid. Not that it existed, rather the way it was handled. It just got sappy and cheezy with silly dialogue and ridiculous overtones. Not to mention we were hammered over the head with it. And I don't generally like brats in films like these (Temple of Doom perhaps being one of the few exceptions), and though this one was better than most (no incessant whining and screeching) he was still a bit out of place and was focussed on WAY too much. As well, John Hannah's antics were completely overdone this film...and Rachel Weisz wasn't clumsy enough.That side, the baddies were all amusingly well acted (great seeing Adewale in a role other than hardened criminal...oh...never mind;) I still think he's an amazing actor!) and I love the guy who plays Imhotep. But the pacing of the film (which started *really* well) got skewed about halfway through the film and the film started to suffer. Too many action scenes jammed into too short a period of time. They were all becoming generic (and rehashes of the first film), and how many cliffhanger 'He's going to die!! Quickly!! Grab him!!' scenes can one bear within a couple of hours??? The final John Hannah grab for the jewel had me rolling my eyes and begging for the bloody film to finish already! (and cartoon style action films are cartoon style action films, but it would be nice to see a good character in some actual pain and peril once in awhile or it simple becomes yawnable).Overall: I liked the film. I especially loved the continuity between films. And I look forward to The Scorpion King. But I hope that it's better scripted and lives up to its potential a bit more. 6/10.",The Mummy Returns

158,Hussain-AL-Naseer,The Mummy & The Mummy Returns,8,14 May 2020,"The Mummy and The Mummy Returns both are my all time favorite movies as the Cinematic experience I got with both the movies on single screen theater is just I can not forget. Both films are the visual gems and has the capability to give you a great visual experience of ancient Egypt.
Action sequences, storytelling, Cinematography, Art, Costumes , Sets and CGI effects are some of the aspects to look for.
Both the films are blended with Humor, Emotions and some thrilling moments which may bring you to the edges. Director Stephen Sommers has effortlessly done his job to keep the audience intact with his crisp direction. The Screenplay articulated well especially in the second installment as story unfolds and connects with its first installment .
Never forgetting the performances which also contributed equally to make this franchise worth watching. Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connel is surely the Heart and Soul of the movie, the Hero larger then life Macho, Blunt and Brave Fraser has nailed it, he was also exceptional as a caring Father and a lovable Husband in the second installment, Rick O'Connel is the best character Bredan has ever played supported toe to toe by Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan, Arnold Vasloo as Imotep has done good job as most of his role was behind CGI but he is the proper villain we got in the movie, Patricia Velásquez, John Hannah & Oded Fehr all justified their presence and supported well to the leads.
What ruined this franchise was its third installment even Jet Li as main Antagonist couldn't save it. Rachel Weisz & director Stephen Sommers absence felt greatly and Alex as grown up is something that I didn't buy as the little Alex in second installment was Brave kid just like his father which was all lost in third installment.",The Mummy Returns
159,cLoNe,A worthy sequel,9,21 June 2001,"More of the same. If you liked the first Mummy you'd enjoy the second one.
Most of the faces are the same, but the new plot takes them in a different direction. Nothing brilliant, but it serves as a good excuse for a variety of cool scenes in cool locations.  I think I liked the first movie better, but this movie has a few wonderful scenes that make it hard to decide which Mummy movie is better.
  They are both great popcorn movies, I suppose.  The only thing that really bothered me was Freddie Boath who plays the little cute/annoying kid. The problem was that he was more annoying than cute, as a well as an incredibly bad actor. I was not surprised to see that his mother is a producer in his IMDB profile. Oh well...--MB",The Mummy Returns
160,Kirasjeri,MORE PATRICIA VELASQUEZ!!,7,2 June 2001,"""The Mummy"" was a fun, enjoyable action film with great special effects. ""The Mummy Returns"" is pretty much the same. If you liked the first there is no way you could not like this.Instead of Imhotep's face in a giant sandstorm he is there in a giant wall of water. Still cool. There are generally a little more digital FX's, which is neither good nor bad; that is the way it is. There are some DIFFERENCES. The bad ones are that there is a bit less character development and more mindless fun. Some scenes and things seem aimed at a slightly younger audience, such as the flying dirigible, which I did not need. Wrestling star, The Rock, was not entirely convincing as a giant digital scorpion.On the other hand, the film makes GREAT use of the two hot brunette babes, Rachel Weisz, and PATRICIA VELASQUEZ who played Ank-Su Namun, the mummy's main squeeze. Both are used much better and feistier than in the first film. Velasquez had little more than a cameo then, but fit in nicely here in a major role. Velasquez is a former Miss Venezuela and top model, and is gorgeous, and does a very nice job acting, too. If there is a third ""Mummy"" I sure want to see more of her.Very good popcorn entertainment. Fun. Go see it, or rent it when available.",The Mummy Returns

But another force has also been set loose in the world... one born of the darkest rituals of ancient Egyptian mysticism, and even more powerful than Imhotep. When these two forces clash, the fate of the world will hang in the balance, sending the O'Connells on a desperate race to save the world from unspeakable evil, and rescue their son before it is too late...This movie has extreme action in it.

He is one of the most powerful actors who adds much more to the story. The wit of Alex is worth mentioning. The fight between Evelyn and Anck Su Na mun is a good action sequence.

The first movie seemed to be set in its time (the 1920s), but this film could have happened in any decade except for the funny-looking cars. Oddly enough you never believe that Brendan and Rachel are the parents of their cute little plot point, er, son. They like him well enough, but they never act like his parents. He suffers from being too precocious like most kids in these kinds of movies, but he's funny and interesting. As an ""OZ"" fan, I was thrilled to see Adebisi as one of the lead henchmen! He was quite menacing. It was just OK.",The Mummy Returns
165,brandon_lee420,Love it to death!,10,9 January 2010,"The sequel to the granddaddy of all adventure films is truly mind-blowing, action packed, excellent, and a must-buy. It is ten times better than the original and that was the bomb. So if that was the bomb what would you call this? A WARHEAD packed with enough nuclear atoms to blow you out of your seat and all the way to Hollywood. The acting is even better than it's predecessor and it surely does contain more humor than the last along with better enemies. Stephen Sommers knew how to make one of the best sequels ever by including what the first film didn't have: Cooler and stronger enemies, more character development, better story, more adventure-themed style, and a great cast that has Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, and the beautiful Rachael Weisz. The new addition to the family is Rick's and Evelyn's son, Alex O'Connell (played by Freddie Boath). He is what every other boy wants to be. He is smart and witty, fearless, his personality is like any other boys but something about him makes people have a liking to him. The biggest surprise is the SCORPION KING played by Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson but he is all animated and looks fake and he sure does make one of the best enemies in film history. This film is fun and original while it also maintains knowledge for the young ones.After selling his soul to Anubis, Mathayus, a young warrior commands Anubis's whole fleet of soldiers and wrecks chaos. Thousands of years later, an artifact known as the Bracelet Of Anubis is discovered by the O'Connell's but what they don't know is that High Priest Imhotep has risen from the dead once again and is after the bracelet for it holds great power. The only problem that stops him from getting the Bracelet is Alex O'Connell, son of Rick, has attached the bracelet to his wrist and the only way to take it off is.... (a long story). If the Scorpion King is defeated, Priest Imhotep will be the new owner of Anubis's fleet and with that power he will make the world bow down to him. The O'Connell's and their friend Ardeth Bay have to fight once again through mummies, soldiers, weird stick creatures, in order to save their son and most importantly, save the world.The action is tremendous and non-stop as the O'Connell's leave a trail of mummies behind them. The enemies play an important part in the film and it is really cool when they are being blown up to smithereens. The best enemies are probably the running mummies and the army of Anubis. People are complaining that the special effects are trash, and they maybe are, but that not the point of the movie. The effects are good but the story is even better. Who needs special effects when they have an excellent story? Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, John Hannah, Oded Fehr, have good acting talents because they were made to play their roles. A few old enemies will make appearances in this film, like Imhotep, Anck-Su-Namun, and who could forget the lovely black beetles. The third film in the series is cr*p and should be avoided and you should instead watch Mummy Returns instead. (Spoiler!!!)The best scenes in the whole movie are the hot-air balloon being chased by water and the stick- men fight. Hilarious! Haters probably like complaining with everything and their comments should be discarded. If you guys haven't watched this, you must be living on mars because good movies hardly come out and the mummy is one of the good ones.",The Mummy Returns
166,lingmeister,Lame-O,4,29 May 2002,"Bad jokes, implausible situations, cheap scares and really bad special effects.  That pretty much describes The Mummy Returns.The movie isn't even funny, with much jokes of B-movie quality.Much of the plot is not believable, with irrational things being done in which the audience would scream at them on the screen not to do it.There were no suspense at all in this movie, the only scare were those subjects that jumps into the view of the camera just to frighten the audience, but in reality, it was totally visible to the characters on the screen.They should be embarrassed with the special effects, with the totally fake looking Scorpion King topping them all.  Plus I can't believe that they try to make a balloon fly around at high speed with rockets and not have the balloon tear off due to the wind resistance it would encounter, let alone having rocket technology advanced enough for anything.All in all, a waste of time.",The Mummy Returns
167,fearfulofspiders,(REVIEW #100) The Special Effects Are This Film's True Handicap...,5,24 September 2008,"If you fell in love with 1999's The Mummy, then there is sure to be some likable factor in The Mummy Returns. Everyone is back for a second adventure, and with a pretty good story, the film's only major handicap is its special effects.The acting is hammier than the first, I must admit. Frasier is one-dimensional in this sequel, being that there is no real impact on his character that makes him any different from the first, or the beginning of this one; Weisz is misused as well. Even with the expansion of their characters (as being reincarnations) this only makes them subpar of two-dimensional. Oded Fehr's return allows more depth to his character, and he is probably the only one worth rooting for, as Arnold Vosloo is more convincing as a decaying mummy than he is in flesh. John Hannah's character, whom I left out of the first movie's review, is back, and is great as the comedy relief, but then again, even that title is limited, as The Mummy Returns delves more into comedy, rather than action.Special effects allow for viewers to become entranced, and makes the story being told more believable. Yet, there is not one moment of realistic trickery, making this sequel worthy of a minus-three stars in total. The Scorpion King is so fake looking, as well as when Imhotep sucks the skin (or how ever he does it) makes the movie lose any grasp it once had on the viewer.The music is disappointing, as there is nothing new or impressive about it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as you could just listen to the first's and still get the same quality.All in all, with bad acting and special effects to boot, this film is worth five-stars out of the possible ten. While providing escapism, the film loses to much believability to regain its seating as rousing fun. Instead, it's a disappointing adventure that I can only recommend to faithful fans.",The Mummy Returns

Continuing from where the Mummy left off, in this installment, the body of the pries re-awakens and creates havoc.The first movie had the benefit of a new, interesting cast and a possibly good movie but this second installment had nothing going for it. From the beginning it was obvious that this was simply a sad attempt of banking on the success of the first film. They didn't even have the decency of giving us a new story, the just recycled the old one.What is left for us here is a movie full of nothing but special effects and, fortunately, the public is not yet dumb enough to accept this.5/10 This installment had nothing going for it other than the cast and some redone fx",The Mummy Returns
169,Mr. Pulse,"Watchable, and enjoyable, almost throughout.",6,4 May 2001,"I saw The Mummy, and enjoyed it somewhat, and when I needed something to watch tonight I settled on the sequel.  I don't recall the original well enough to compare them very closely, but I can say that I did enjoy the sequel.  Not all that terribly much, but I would recommend it.For about the first hour, the film is a wonderful action comedy.  The characters, dialogue, and action were all working for me.  Then at about the halfway mark things start slowing down in the film, and when the action picks up at the end for a conclusion (That features no less than 3 simulatneous battles going on at any one time), it feels anti-climactic, hardly exciting, and ripe with action film cliches.Some of the stuff, like the interaction between the characters of the film first (I especially liked Jonathan, once more a worthless but humorous sidekick) works very nicely.  Others, like the good portion of screen time spent on a bizarre dirigible, including a chase scene that mirrors one from the original film, don't.  Most of the best stuff comes early in the film, and I found by the end I was losing interest.Part of the problem could be that the film is really exciting from the start, and practically doesn't let up for the first hour.  After that, I was sufficiently thrilled, I almost didn't need more, so when the conclusion came, I didn't have any energy left to invest in it.Those who are going to see The Rock in this film, be warned.  He appears for only about 5 minutes in the film.  I don't quite understand how he got so much money and billing for a part that seemed like a cameo to me.  Imhotep, the Mummy from the first film, returns (Hence the title) but is pretty underused.  I would marginally recommend the film, especially to fans of the first, but I would not go in expecting anything more than a summer action film that presents a lot of special effects, perhaps too many for its own good.",The Mummy Returns

Thus an ancient evil is released yada yada etc. Basically what you need to know is this is more of the same un-complicated adventure from the 1st film, if you liked the first one then you'll get along just fine with this.Rachel Weisz is stunning as ever playing Evie and Brendan Frasier does pretty well again with the all action hero Rick O Connell. I really enjoyed John Hannah's comedy sidekick in this movie who provided some funny scenes between the action packed sequences, also the Rock was well cast as the scorpion king. Where this film lacks over it's predecessor is in some very dodgy CGI and the addition of an irritating kid as a main character. Also as with all sequels it doesn't feel as fresh as the original. There are also a few cringe worthy scenes of father son bonding and some jokes that miss the mark by a mile.7/10 - Good fun but feels padded out and not as fresh as the original.",The Mummy Returns

The special effects, the acting, the storyline, the comic relief, and even the music are all completely cheesy. Even worse, the movie tries to take itself seriously while the audience just can't. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I was with this movie, especially since the first Mummy was so great. The first had lots of adventure and a good story to it but this one doesn't. The action is boring and repetitive. The story is pointless. I don't see any reason how anyone could like this one better.There were some good parts, but not enough to save this horrible movie. It also runs painfully long. Any movie this bad shouldn't be over two hours. It shouldn't even be more than two minutes.

176,Keyser Soze-12,"In a word: decent. It's entertaining. Bad, but entertaining.",5,11 May 2001,"I hate people who don't like movies that have one goal: to entertain.  Some movies aren't made to be awe inspiring.  Some movies aren't made to be classics.  Some movies are made for the simple purpose of being fun.  The Mummy was one of these.  It was a fun, funny, and cool movie.  Anyone who didn't like 1999's The Mummy is not human.  Now we have the sequel.  It is entertaining, but no where near as good as the original.Seeing this movie made me appreciate the first movie.  The first Mummy was an adventure movie, through and through.  In the tradition of Indiana Jones, the movie took us to another world, made us laugh, built suspense, and was really cool.  The sequel is nothing like this.  In the first movie, we don't see the mummy Ie-Moh-Tep until almost an hour into the movie.  It used the ""Jaws"" technique of not showing the monster until the audience becomes annoyed at its absense.  The Mummy Returns goes ahead and shows us the Mummy in its first 30 minutes.  Is this bad?  Not really.  Its just different.Next, the major difference between the two movies is the pace.  The Mummy was relaxed, not moving slow, but not overdoing itself.  It kept running at a brisk pace.  Now The Mummy Returns is fast.  Very fast.  Jet speed fast. The movie does not waist time in character development (because they did that in the first movie and if you're seeing this movie you've seen the original).  The Mummy 2 runs from one action scene to another.  I found that after the first hour I was getting real tired of it.  Too much of a good thing, after all.The movie's biggest problem is the thing the first movie did so well: its special effects.  The Mummy Returns has some of the poorest excuses for CGI special effects I have ever seen.  Okay, maybe not.  But this is ILM folks. The people who invented modern day movie special effects starting with the fisrt Star Wars movies and moving on to Terminator 2, to Jurassic Park, and the upcoming Pearl Harbor.  These guys are the best in the business.  So why are the effects so bad?  Because ILM's schedule is packed, and something had to be cut.  Think about it.  ILM is doing Jurassic Park 3, Pearl Harbor, A.I., Star Wars Episode II, Planet of the Apes, The Mummy Returns, and other movies all at the same time.  Some movie had to get shafted.  Well, this is it.  Some of the effects in this movie are great.  Any effect involving a face in some thing like a wall of water of smoke (like the wall of sand in the original) is great.  The ending battle scene is done good.  Some other scenes are great.  But there are plenty of other BAD special effects shots to make up for it.  Overall the movie just looks fake and this impacts the overall effect the film has.  Movies like this need to be fun and somewhat believable.  If the effects suck, well, so does the movie.I have one last major gripe.  I can beleive that people can be brought back from the dead.  Yea, I can.  It's part of the movie.  It's the whole point of the movie.  If you can't suspend that belief than just stop reading this and go rent Gone With the Wind.  But I cannot suspend the belief that a hot air balloon has after-burners.  There is this scene where the movie's main vehical, a hot air balloon, is being chased by the wall of water with Ie-moh-tep's face (a-la the Mummy 1).  Well, to escape, the pilot (if you can call a guy who flies a hot air balloon a pilot) hits a button and, vu-al-la, these rockets egnite and the ballon escapes in a burst of speed. The rockets are the main propulsion device on this balloon, that belief I can suspend for the sake of entertainment.  But AFTERBURNERS!?  HAHAHAH! That's laughable!In conclusion:  This is an entertaining movie, but a bad movie.  the plot is very, very, very, very, very weak.  The characters and the actors are pretty weak.  Even the damn special effects are weak.  But, hey, it is kindof fun. Go see it with the kids, they'll get a kick out of it.  But trust me, this is a movie you see once, talk about once, then forget.Rating: 5/10",The Mummy Returns

I thought this movie was creative and alot of fun, and the computer special effects were not too much at all. Truthfully if the movie didn't have the special effects well it really wouldn't make any of it believable now, would it ?! Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz do a great job of reprising the eternal love between Rick and Evie, Freddie Boath did a great job as Alex and his character did seem to be a stronger combination of and than his parents. You have to love John Hannah as Jonathan, he's such a sweetie and him being a clutz is just hilarious. Oded Fahr was kewl as Ardeth Bay, he really get's into his role and  I hope to see him in further roles in Hollywood, I loved his character.

178,DoctorSkyTower,WAS THIS TRYING TO OUTDO STAR WARS T.P.M?,5,11 July 2001,"I went in expecting a little more than I would of a movie of this S.F.X-laden genre.  Unfortunately I was expecting a wee bit too much. I didn't like the first Mummy, so hoped this Sequel would better it - and it did, C.G.I wise! But the story is so lame, boring and cliche-ridden one must have all brain cells surgically removed (or maybe the whole brain!), or try not to think (and confuse oneself) about the events of the first movie.WARNING! MUMMIFIED SPOILERS!The plot revolves around our two main characters, she being the reincarnation of an Egyptian pharoah's daughter and he being the Saviour of the world (say what??).  This is pretty hard to grasp unless you suspend all disbelief. Question: How come Imhotep (the Mummy guy) doesn't recognize her in the first movie??There is so much action scenes they become boringly tedious and the sound (which was cranked up to max in my theater) was absolutely hideous. To hear stuff scream (and there is a LOT of stuff screaming in this flick) at 200 decibels is rather pain-inducing. The anubis army charging over the sand dunes in their thousands is too much like the droid armies in Star Wars T.P.M. We also borrow ideas from Indiana Jones, but this doesn't 'make it', because the overuse of fake C.G.I is SO obviously fake.Hollywood End Acts are becoming mandatory these days.  We have the just-escaped-by-the-skin-of-the-teeth-from-certain-death scene. Not once, but several times!  We are even subjected to the good-guy-dies-but-is-brought-back-to-life cliche. Oh puhleeeeeze!!!! No more brain numbing cliches! But wait - there's more.Dear Hollywood: Audiences DO have IQ's above sea level.

You know it will come back when a movie gross over 100 hundred million dollars(more close to 200m). The question remains would it be a good sequel or a bad one? The answer depends of what you expect from a film or,for that matter, a sequel. If you expect that the sequel will give you some characters development,will be more sophisticated and will have some reasonable not to mention a convincing plot, than look somewhere else , because you will not find these things in this film. It basically do ""The Mummy"" all over with not much changes to it. The characters remain the same, though the addition of Evie's past was a nice touch,though very much convenient. The plot the remains the same, and everything goes as predictable as a sequel can be. Not a shred of surprise or originality here. You can see what comes miles ahead.The effects were good though in some cases they looked like computer generated ones (which means they look phony and not convincing enough, which shouldn't happen in a film that relies heavily on effects).Nevertheless the film is fun to watch and entertaining enough to ignore all other aspects. The film enjoy a fast phase which is its great asset and help passed it 2 hours running quite quickly. It is not a must film.

It never gets boring, such as its predecessor The Mummy.  That film tended to drag and the mummy isn't shown until a quarter into the movie.  But this film keeps the action moving and doesn't abandon its characters.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz generate great chemistry and the screenplay develops them so well.  I love the way they connect with their son, Alex.  They care for him and play that convincingly, therefor, we care.Some critics say the film is boring because it has TOO MUCH action.  I disagree.  That's what makes this film great, plus it has an interesting plot.  The mummy is resurrected by the reincarnation of his former love, An-nack-su-namun, to battle the Scorpion King, whose 5000 years of slumber is about to end, in order to take control of his army, Anubis warriors.  The main characters have to stop the mummy and kill the Scorpion King in order to send the army back to the sand from wence they came and also save their son who wears the Bracelet of Anubis which the mummy needs to guide him the Am Sheer, the resting place of the scorpion king.I got that from the first viewing and I didn't know what this movie was about.  With all its characters and complicated plot, one would think this movie would turn into a mess right before our very eyes, but it doesn't. The plot was rich enough to carry on for two and a half hours.  This movie is way better than the first, even though some of the action scenes are dangerously similar to the ones seen in the first movie.",The Mummy Returns

The only thing I hate about the movie is Dwayne Johnson as the Scorpion King in the climax. Shoddy animation (I know it's from 2001, but Independence Day in 1996 and Jurassic Park 1 & 2, also in the 90s, have much better animation). Rather pathetic.
Other than that, it's an excellent, excellent movie that I love!

185,darkjosh,A Mindless Whirlwind of CGI,3,7 May 2001,"Had it not been for my anger and annoyance with the constant use of computer graphics that often looked subpar and ridiculous, The Mummy Returns would have put me into a deep sleep for a couple thousand years.There are so many poor aspects of the film, but to start, I will not mention The Rock as a star.  That's because he has a 5-minute cameo (and 5 minutes is stretching it) in the beginning and then returns in the last 10 minutes of the movie as a CGI monstrosity that looks like the latest Gameboy WWF Raw! installment.  Trailers would have us believe he is a major part of the film, and he is: he will get lots of ignorant moviegoers to shell out the bucks.Mummy brings back the characters from the previous flick for more mindless action along with an annoying child.  They travel through Egypt and London attempting to stop the evil mummy Imhotep from taking over the world (I think) as well as the Scorpion King from attempting to do the same (I think).  Director Stephen Sommers is congratulated for giving us the first special-effects-ridden, mindnumbing, corny, deafening Hollywood monstrosities of the summer.   While Mummy Returns certainly contains more action than its predecessor, it also has the same corny one-liners, stupid, illogical characters, muted violence, and shameless visuals from the first. It forgets to do what a worthwhile movie does: give us a good story and memorable characters.  The Mummy Returns is not only the same clumsy retread that The Mummy was, it's also a testament to Hollywood's extraneous dependence on budget and CGI to characters and screenwriting.  And judging from the millions it'll rake in, it's also a sad commentary on audiences' intelligence.3 out of 10",The Mummy Returns

But on the other hand, the movie nearly never lets you breath, jumping from one event to the next without any pause, the story never really surprises, the characters lack any characterization, its just fun and action, action and fun.Following the mainstream is not in general a bad idea, but in this case there is nothing but mainstream, and in this extreme form it is really boring.",The Mummy Returns
189,bilahn,Migraine inducing,4,7 May 2001,"The Mummy, released in 1999, was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. A spoof of the old movie serials, it took the old classic and actually did something new and different with it. While no masterpiece, it had wit, fun character portrayals, and took its liesurly time in telling its story, using great special effects judiciously. It was really a movie to make you smile, yet ahead its share of ""horror"" and gross outs. The Mummy Returns has little of any of this, and what it does have is completely buried in the relentless barrage of special effects and earsplitting noise. Never did I imagine they could a movie more loud and obnoxious than Armegeddon or The Matrix, but they have succeeded in doing so.  The visuals are often stunning, but there is too much, and too little of everything else. For all the action, this movie is very boring. There is a story, but its hard to even pay attention to it with all the sensory overload. Brendon Fraser himself pretty much drowns in the mess, and the Mummy himself, central and rather charming in the original, is a mere decoration here. And of course they add a kid to propel the story. The best I can say is he is not as obnoxious as most movie kids.Of course, since louder, brasher and faster seems to by synomomous with quality, audiences will love it. What really mystifies me is how some critics, who are supposedly sophisticated and knowledgeable about movies, can consider this superior to the original, or even more inexplicable, the critics who don't see the difference between the two, either liking both or not liking both. As for the criticism, ""Hey its just a fun movie - not Shakespeare"" - well The Mummy wasn't Shakespeare either, it was mindless but fun. This was mindless and unpleasant.

193,arturmachado-29588,The Mummy Sunks,5,2 September 2017,"It's sad to see what could have been an excellent sequel turned into just another stupid movie of stupid action. The bases for a great story are there, but it was very poorly delivered. The adorable heroes seem to have another personality, causing them to lose the chemistry between them from the first movie, much because of the script and the dialogues, especially Evelyn who in this film discovers - see the stupidity - to be the reincarnation of the princess ""warrior"" Nefertiri, which makes her a woman of guns instead of the charming half-snobbish girl of the first movie, the purpose of this so she can have some fight sequences with Anksunamun, the lover Imotep wants to resurrect.What really irritates me is that in the end Anksunamun turns her back on Imotep by betraying him to death. Why?!? Does not make sense. Why would she have killed the Pharaoh and committed suicide for Imotep's sake now to turn her back on him? That was part of the charm of these villains: even though they were evil, they had this human spark - they loved each other. But I also have to admit that from the entire movie - from the WHOLE movie - that was the only scene that really messed with me so cruel it was. If they had to die then it should be together: she would try to save him but she would fail, both falling into the abyss with the souls pushing them away and taking them to the bottom as they try in vain to hold hands. Would not this end be more beautiful and even more tragic and appropriate?Alex, the son, is funny in the role of ""smart kid"" but unnecessary to the plot, and the sequence in which he leaves the clues to his parents in plain sight for all to see is very badly thought so much in terms of writing as accomplishment. The whole film is exaggerated: the action is exaggerated (now the mummies run along walls and ceilings), comedy and goofiness and animation are exaggerated, too many special effects obviously unfinished that do not mix well at all with the rest of the background unlike the first movie. This is one of those cases where LESS would be MORE. And it makes me sad that the fantastic first movie does not have a better reputation because of these horrible sequels.",The Mummy Returns

A lot of things happened but I became bored at times. There are some pretty good scenes in the movie like the chase by the mummies on a double deckar bus, but during most action scenes I just thought so what.

198,Denver53,"Mindless summer fun, and cheese",6,14 May 2001,"Some of the movies that are the most fun to watch are the action adventure films that come out each summer. They cram lots of special effects, fighting, running and everything else that makes a movie vibrate into about 90 minutes.Unfortunately, that rarely makes these summer flicks *good* movies. Even allowing for the mindlessness of a summer film, I had a hard time with aspects of Mummy 2. I gave it a 6, and only because of the fact it was intended to be a summer film.First, I don't know what Brendan Fraser is doing, but his portrayal of an action hero in the Indiana Jones tradition is awkward. Fraser bounces back and forth between sentimental husband and savy adventurer, able to snatch snakes and knives out of the air. He even *walks* funny, kind of hunched over, gorilla-like. The sequel (and the original) make great efforts to tell us, through dialogue, that Fraser's character is blunt and more likely to fight and ask questions later than think his way out of a tough situation. And yet this same character is so sensitive to his wife, and so aware of the needs of those around him, that his ""action guy"" mode seems out of place. He is too smart and too caring to be the fearless hero.Second, why in the world did this movie create a very cheesy ""scorpion king monster"" in the finale? That was probably the most fake looking monster, especially the face (which was The Rock's face, sort of), I have seen since that 1982ish movie about Perseus and the Greek gods who manipulated him. You kept expecting this scorpion thing to speak, and we had several close-ups of the enraged face, but all it ever did was roar. And this was supposed to be the latest version of a great warrior bent on taking over the world? He seemed as smart as a rock (no pun intended).Finally, several actors/roles were all wrong, or at least not done well. Izzy, the dirigible-for-hire guy, was supposed to provide comic relief, I guess. But his delivery and English accent were far too sophisticated to be convincing for the kind of rogue-for-hitre character he played. The character who was curator at the British museum and as well as the person who was bringing Ahotep back from the dead made no sense. What was his motivation? We never saw Ahotep reward anyone except his woman. Why help him?Still, the movie was loud, fast and mostly fun, even if it made little sense. If you're trying to escape the summer heat, check out a matinee.",The Mummy Returns

When a chain of events finds the corpse of Imhotep resurrected, the O'Connells go on a desperate race to save the world from unspeakable evil and to rescue their son before it is too late. The Mummy Returns is still good, old-fashioned, serial-throwback fun. It has also an amazing soundtrack from Alan Silvestri. Overall, the film probably offers what fans of The Mummy are expecting. This movie is essentially more of the same.

200,Wulfstan10,"Dull, Inane",3,9 March 2005,"This took the step that the original Mummy never quite did: it went right right off the edge and into the abyss of boredom. It very occasionally scrambled to pull itself out but never succeeded, in part because it barely tried. While the first Mummy film was mildly fresh and fun in its modern take on old campy stories like this, the second film just rehashes that idea with a slightly different plot that is much more stupid and ridiculous. It is now quite tired, dull, and downright inane, with really very little of value. It goes without saying that there is little or no character development and it relies on cheap, worn-out gags and thrills. I wouldn't even have bothered to watch it had someone not given me a copy to see and I certainly have no intention of watching it ever again.I give it a 3 because it would have been a little (and I stress ""a little"") more fresh had it been the first one, was fairly well presented, and because there are many much worse films out there.

This isn't a funny shtick, it's just annoying.Alex is annoying as hell, the actor has no talent other than just saying his lines and also, why cast a very blond kid when his parents have darker hair.John Hannah is also more annoying in this one.

Definitely seems like there would have to be some sort of spell uttered for them also.Too many unexplained things happening and the story has no substance.The cgi is another let down. In some scenes it looks good, others it looks absolutely terrible (The Scorpion King looks like a PlayStation 1 character).Rick's tattoo is supposed to be something he's had all is life yet he didn't have it in the first movie, but now it's visible because it's convenient to the story.When Jonathan throws the spear, Imhotep catches it and decides to throw out at the Scorpion King, but then Rick catches it and uses it and more Imhotep is gutted that the Scorpion King is defeated.",The Mummy Returns
203,Steve-318,"Action, special effects, nonsense.",3,17 March 2002,"Mindless rubbish--that's how another IMBD reader referred to this sequel--and that's pretty accurate.  The fact that it was one of Hollywood's designated ""big"" movies for 2001, grossing over $200 million, is not surprising.  After all the Brendan Fraser heroics worked well in the first ""Mummy"" picture, only slightly less ridiculous than this one.What you've got here appears to be the successor to the ""Indiana Jones"" series of constant cliffhangers, live-action cartoons that chew up characters with abandon.  While extras die like flies, the audience apparently doesn't care that every bullet, sword and scimitar leveled at our heroes (a total of six people in this one) is guaranteed to miss and that every unbelievable scene is one-upped by the one following it. When one of those blades actually finds its mark and a major character dies --not to worry--the death doesn't take and she comes back.  Surprise!The sequel trades on the fact that we're already familiar with the Mummy, who's come a long way since his shuffling Boris Karloff days.  This Imenhotep is a savage superfiend, part Spiderman and part Freddie Krueger, apparently with only one weakness--he just can't snuff out Fraser or any of the other members of his cinematic family.  And, oh yes, there's a kid in this one who exudes as much charm as the insufferable brat brought to ""Star Wars--Phantom."" But this seems directly aimed at the younger set and has video game written all over it.  You've got some mini-mummies who come flying out of the tall grass a la the ""jurassic"" raptors and a scorpion king with the head of a Rock.Without Fraser's breezy style, the whole thing would collapse but the producers don't appear too concerned with dramatic license.  There's nothing unusual about Hollywood heroes overcoming ridiculous odds but whether it's James Bond, Arnold or Jackie Chan, the secret for success is to concoct a plot that allows for the suspension of reality.Yet the ""Mummy"" team just piles up the special effects and trots off laughing--all the way to the bank.I gave this thing a ""3"" only because it might do something to encourage further study of ancient Egypt.",The Mummy Returns

205,MadReviewer,"So Unoriginal, It Borders On Kleptomania",4,4 May 2001,"`The Mummy Returns"" suffers from heavy-handed thievery.  It's probably a terrific movie if you've never seen any other movies before in your life, or if you've been living in a cave for the past twenty-five years, but if you don't meet the above criteria, then you're in for a bland, shameless rehash of a dozen other action movies that are better than `The Mummy Returns'. Combine this with a rather dull story and shoddy CGI effects, and you've got the first forgettable, must-miss blockbuster of 2001.Ten years after the events of `The Mummy' ended (`The Mummy', incidentally, was a fun, much superior film to this dreck), we find erstwhile adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frasier) married to his tempestuous love Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), living in London and leading relatively normal lives.  (The fact that such characters could ever contemplate living normal lives is possibly the only original part of the film.) However, fate and a heavy-handed script conspire to bring the body of the Mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) to the British Museum.  Once again, the Mummy Imhotep awakens, determined to live again and bring about the destruction of the world. Only Rick, Evelyn, and their 9-year old son Alex (Freddie Boath) can defeat the Mummy and save the world for impending doom.  Blah, blah, blah.`The Mummy Returns' is wall-to-wall action, but that's probably due to necessity, since the movie doesn't have anything to say.  Action can be fun in its own right, but great action usually at least has a semblance of a story as its backbone, and `The Mummy Returns' usually has nothing.  When it does have something to say, it's cribbed straight out of `Indiana Jones'. Or `Romancing the Stone'. Or occasionally, when it's feeling ambitious, it stretches back to steal from Errol Flynn classics such as `Captain Blood'. There's no new twists in `The Mummy Returns', nothing that hasn't already been seen in a hundred other actions movies before . . . and definitely nothing that hasn't already been seen in its infinitely better predecessor, `The Mummy'.  Yes, some of the fight scenes are spectacular  a flashback fight between Evelyn and the Egyptian princess Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez) is particularly outstanding  and the action makes for some over-the-top fun; but after awhile, it's simply gratuitous, mildly exciting filler.  (And the CGI work is uneven  while it's probably fun for the programmers to dream this cutting-edge stuff up, it still looks jarringly fake.) It's fun, even dumb fun, but dumb fun has been done in other films, and in much better films than `The Mummy Returns'.Performances:  Brendan Frasier is pretty good, but his character Rick is more or less a mechanism for delivering quips and punchlines, nothing more. Rachel Weisz, whose character is much stronger than she was in the first `Mummy' film, is actually quite good  she blends the cliched damsel-in-distress role with a certain amount of feistiness and sarcasm that makes her very, very appealing.  Arnold Vosloo is wasted yet again as the Mummy  all the guy does is sneer and flex his muscles.  The Mummy's not scary, he's boring cardboard.`The Mummy Returns' isn't nearly as good as `The Mummy'.  Then again, it's not nearly good, period.  Possibly worth watching if in you're in a mood for idiotic fun, but even then, you can do much better than this needless waste of film.  Grade:  C-",The Mummy Returns

The film was a lot like the ""Indiana Jones"" series, though ""The Mummy"" was much more airheaded. There was also a good balance of special effects, character development and story advancement. In ""The Mummy Returns"" director Stephen Sommers thought for some reason it would be a good idea to scrap everything good from the first one and fill the sequel with tons of special effects and action sequences, to distract the viewer from realizing that this movie wasn't very good. The action overload gets quite overbearing after the first 35-40 minutes and just becomes tiresome about halfway through, at which point I considered leaving but decided to give it the MST3K treatment instead.The only good parts of the movie were actor Oded Fehr and actress Rachel Weisz (who looked oh so beautiful in this film).

Action, adventure, romance and a lot of fun as Rick retains his shoot first, second and third approach to problems. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn gets more action and responds with aplom and John Hannah continues to be a fine comedic foil.
Mummies, mini mummies, huge undead Jackal armies and more are thrown at the cast, topped by the return of Imhotep and Anck Su Namun who also get to develop their characters and relationship to a heartbreaking degree and they provide one of the most tragic and moving parts of what is essentially a fantastic popcorn movie.",The Mummy Returns
213,Rhino Rover,Action packed but...,8,7 May 2001,"I'm starting to see a trend in the new action/adventure movies and it may not be for the better. CGI (Computer Generated Images) is becoming one of the primary tools of many filmmakers but is it coming at a cost? We began to see CGI come into movies quite a few years ago but they were usually as enhancements to the story or to the set. Now CGI is becoming more prominent and taking a center stage role. The Mummy Returns is a very good example of this.The Mummy Returns is a sequel to the very popular The Mummy that came out in 1999. The story basically takes place several years later after our hero, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) have gotten married and have a young son (Freddie Boath). The couple are still the adventurous archeologists they were in the first movie but now they have a young son to take with them on their adventures. This story revolves around the resurrection of our arch villain, Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), but with a slight twist. This time around he's to kill the Scorpion King (The Rock) that will be making a reappearance after 5000 years to take over the world. But as noble as that sounds, his motives are less than desirable.
Was I entertained? Yes, definitely BUT, this was a case of too much CGI. The blending of reality and fantasy together with CGI can be a tricky thing, especially when the two worlds meet. The audience whether consciously or not, will instinctively pick up on things when they are unable to identify with it. In this movie, we see many instances where the two worlds meet and quite a few times, my eye was attracted to something that didn't move naturally. Unlike the movie, Matrix, where we were basically told to suspend all beliefs about the law of physics and such, this movie incorporated characters that behaved human-like yet movements and detail gave them away. Mind you, I do not often see walking wolf-like creatures but their mannerism and general body shape was humanoid so the natural instinct was to identify with what you know and in too many cases, it didn't look right to the eye. The decision to generate a complete CGI of the Scorpion King at the end of the movie I thought was a big error. The looks were too cartoonish and resembled something you see on Saturday morning cartoons. It was too distracting and took away from the events at the time.However, I really enjoyed the fight sequences between the female leads (Weisz and Velazquez). They were quick and well choreographed. It's refreshing to see that directors are not afraid to show female leads as strong characters that are just as capable to fight as their male counter-parts. Fraser and Weisz played their parts well and like the last movie, Oded Fehr is outstanding. The Rock however is something else. In his movie debut, I found his performance a little bit extreme and probably not too far from his wrestling persona. Whether this will be the beginning of a film career or not, I cannot tell but hopefully his acting improves.
Overall, this was a very entertaining movie to kick off the summer. It was full of action and fast paced but I've seen much better computer graphics in other movies.",The Mummy Returns

Acting from everyone is great and I enjoyed the humor, everytime something funny came I Could hear people in the theatre laughing.

215,johanleupen,Unpretentious fun.,7,10 June 2001,The term roller-coaster ride is most befitting this movie. The storyline is intentionally thin and tongue-in-cheek. The cast seems to be having a lot of fun (just like last time). A lot of time was spend on great special effects and set-design. A string of great action sequences is tied together with lost of gags and pace. The pigmee-creatures were especially funny by the way. No complaints here. Just grab your bucket of popcorn and sit back.,The Mummy Returns
216,Yonhap S,"not bad, but first movie was better",5,15 June 2001,"Well, this movie is entertaining the first time.  But I got tired watching its second viewing.  I'm surprised no one here mentioned about Evie's distant past and if that were so, Imhotep should have recognized her a lot better in the first movie.I like the first movie better because it had much better character development and interaction.  This sequel is confident of its characters and proceeds as the plot tells them to (which isn't much to begin with).  At 2 hours, the movie is too long for what is a no-brainer adventure film.rating: 2.5 of 5 stars",The Mummy Returns
217,Nigel St. Buggering,"""The Mummy"" times ten, for better or worse",5,5 May 2001,"If you didn't care for ""The Mummy"", this one won't appeal to you either. Despite a several-year gap and changes in character relationships, there's very little difference here.  The same flip attitude, the same everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink approach.  The only difference is an increase in budget, and thus in the proliferation of special effects.  And therein lies the main problem.This film is a prime example of the principle that just because you CAN put something on the screen, it doesn't mean that you SHOULD.  The filmmakers have a serious problem with restraint; when flesh-eating bugs appear, they can't just show enough to kill people...there has to be a boiling flood of them.  They can't just have a tribe of pygmy zombies chase the characters, there have to be a few hundred.  When Anubis' warriors arrive, they must coat the landscape.  After a while, the effect defeats itself, and it becomes impossible to feel impressed with the scale.Another problem lies in underestimating the audience.  There are far too many ""surprises"" here that we can see coming over the horizon, and yet the filmmakers insist on drawing out the ""suspense"", convinced that we don't know what's about to happen.  Not to print spoilers, but suffice to say, when the plot revolves around resurrection, death is hardly much of a threat.Finally, on a minor note, the much-ballyhooed appearance of The Rock (is he going to start using his name anytime soon?) induces more chuckles than thrills.  The role comprises perhaps five minutes of film time, and his only dialogue is in Egyptian.  And even under these modest demands, his performance fails to impress.  It is very much the performance of someone who makes his living with over-the-top shouting.I give the film a 5 out of 10; it isn't really worse than the first one, but more doesn't mean better, either.",The Mummy Returns

This time Imhotep the grisly Mummy from the 1st movie is back as his body is shipped to London (cue dramatic scene involving red double-decker bus) and is brought back alive, he goes on the rampage as he looks for the bracelet of anubis to be able to control the Scorpion King's (The Rock) army (how a 2 minute cameo turned into a full blown movie i'll never know) and that bracelet just happens to be in the possession of...yes...The O'Connells, their son to be precise.all in all it's not a bad film, it's just full of terrible acting (Only Weisz's performance is any good, probably too good for this bunkum) The special FX are amazing,but the story is a mishmash and most of the dialogue absolutely awful, especially the sickly moments involving the precocious kid.despite it's faults ''The Mummy Returns'' is an enjoyable film, for the FX if nothing else.***1/2 out of *****",The Mummy Returns

220,HBeachBabe,Not as good or as funny as the 1st,6,11 May 2001,"A classic case of sequelitis.  Take those aspects of the last picture that everyone liked, multiply by 10, cut character development to make room and viola, instant sequel.I will admit to not liking Mummy the first time I saw it either.  I was expecting a horror film and instead got a cut-rate Indiana Jones adventure-comedy.  But after watching it again on DVD I developed an enjoyment of the film for what it was- a fun, light-hearted adventure romp with excellent special effects, witty humor, and engaging (if undeveloped) characters.  I even was looking forward to the sequel.Maybe it will take another viewing of this one as well, because on first viewing I found Mummy Returns to lack the fun of the first one. The humor is carried mostly by Rick & Evie's son Alex and Evie's brother Jonothan.  While they have some good lines, they don't measure up to Kevin J. O'Connor's Benny of the first film in terms of comic relief.The film is composed primarily of action scenes that simply lead into one another, many without much purpose other than to show off digital effects- Where did those pygmy mummies come from? and who controlled them?- and others simply a direct lift from the first film - Im-Ho-Tep blows a wall (this time of water instead of sand) at our airborne heroes, complete with his face which again ""eats"" the airship.The hand-to-hand fights were well staged as were nearly all the action sequences (although we have seen the double deck bus into a bridge gag before in a James Bond movie).  The only special effect I was disappointed with was the final Scorpion King.  Why was a digital version of the Rock's face used instead of his real head?Im-ho-tep himself is sadly under used, his place being taken by a couple of forgettable lackeys and the reincarnation of Anck-Su-Namun, along with the ever present threat of the return of the Scorpion King hanging over their heads.An entertaining, if somewhat jumbled & unfocused summer diversion, but don't expect too much.  Just as Mummy was a primer for Phantom Menace, Mummy Returns is just keeping theater seats warm until Pearl Harbor is released.",The Mummy Returns
221,daria84,Pretty good for a sequel.,8,7 May 2003,"This movie is pretty good, it delivers pretty much the same thing we got in the Firs movie.  Some characters are more developed and some others more expanded, all the same, some others are reduced and we are introduced to new characters.  The plot is good, not as good as the first movie, but still does a good job keeping you interested and entertained the whole time. 
The sequel takes place 10 years later, when Rick O'Conell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) are now married, and have a son, Alex (Freddie Boath).  Alex has been kidnaped by the bad guys, including the infamous Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) and his eternal love reincarnated (Patricia Velazques).  Now it's just a matter of time for them to find Alex before it's too late for everybody...The performances are pretty good, almost all of them.  Brendan Fraser does a good job once again as the handsome Rick, he is strong, funny, charismatic, what else can you ask?  Rachel Weisz role has been developed a lot more, she is no longer the clumsy egyptologist wanna-be, now she runs the British museum and is a mom; and she does a great job with that.  John Hannah is also back as  the useless Jonathan, this time not as funny as he used to be. Oded Fehr  character has been expanded a lot, we get to see him a lot more in this movie.  He did a good job as Ardeth.  One more time, the winner of this movie is Arnold Vosloo as the villain; his performance was excellent! He manages to express all the emotions without opening his mouth!  This guy has great acting skills, too bad not many movie producers/directors have noticed it.  The Rock does his movie debut with this movie, he is the Scorpion King, the whole movie turns around him, even though he was in the movie for the first 5 minutes of it.  Still he did a good job for his first time.  Patricia Velazques was the only one who did a BAAAAD job.  Her acting is awful! She is pretty and everything, but she really needs some acting classes.The music once again is one of the key parts of this movie, it is really good, even though Jerry Goldsmith wasn't in charge of it. The direction is good too, just like in the first movie, and we get to see a lot more of special effects.This movie is good, i really enjoyed it, I liked the first one better though, but that's just me.

The characters were marginally likable and a few scenes here and there made me chuckle.The sequel, however, is a monstrosity. It lacks all the cleverness and innocent goodwill of the first movie, which leads me to believe the rumors I hear that a) the first movie benefited from massive uncredited rewrites and b) the same ghost writers left Sommers to his own devices for the second after getting shafted on credit for the first movie.So here we have it, a clear portrait of Stephen Sommers' film-making abilities and they are meager. As a writer he gives us some real gems of dialog. You know that any movie that has a kid say, ""My dad's gonna kick you a**,"" is going to be a real stinker. The rub in this situation comes when you realize that it's the best line in the movie.CGI effects dominate this movie and they are bad.

However, if you are looking for some action packed, good entertainment, this one is for you.All of the original actors, Brenden Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, return for this sequel.  This helps the movie flow.  The action starts right from the beginning and does not stop until the end. There is little or no ""slow"" period in this one.  The special affects are good for the most part but it appeared the f/x artists were either, running out of money or time in a few areas.  Some of the effects seemed either poor or incomplete.  There were also a few other items in the movie that did not make sense.  There were also problems with some of the technology used in this movie that were not invented by the time this film was suppose to take place (such as a reliable rocket engine in 1933).

Maybe a little more originality, but this is Hollywood and that is not possible most of the times. Is there anything wrong of using your eyes instead of your brains for having fun? I hope not, because I don't do that on summer adventure/action movies. Instead, try to take the movie for what it is, a continuation of the money making movie from 1999 to make even more money this time giving people a little more of the same thing the other did.

232,atlihafsteinsson,I'll bet Egyptologists are not pleased,5,1 April 2010,"I've learned that the sequel to a blockbuster hit is always risky business - especially if that film was a well-crafted film to begin with. Many such attempts have failed miserably, while rare cases have been worthy follow-ups. The much-anticipated sequel to Stephen Sommers' ""The Mummy"" lies somewhere in-between those two categories. ""The Mummy Returns"" is indeed an entertaining film that'll have you laughing hard and keeping you on the edge of your seat. But as a film of intelligence and integrity, it falls short in almost every way.In the featurette found under the Special Features of this set, Stephen Sommers confesses that he is a great fan of everything Egypt. However, I find this statement highly ironic considering the fact that the underlying plot of ""The Mummy Returns"" degrades the very heritage of Egyptian mythology. Long ago, a defeated desert warrior, the Scorpion King, made a pact with the dark god Anubis. Together, the two defeated the Scorpion King's enemies, but Anubis subsequently made the Scorpion King his slave and his army fell dormant. If you'll look into Egyptian mythology, Anubis is the god of the dead, who prepares the dead for the afterlife and takes them to the Hall of Judgement; he was never an evil god. To see him presented in such a mutated form as he appears in this film is nothing short of sacrilege to me. Perhaps Sommers was thinking of the god Set (who wasn't even always evil in the Egyptians' book). Either way, I set into this movie with a feeling of anger, not anticipation.The rest of the movie proves to be as short on plot as the opening scene, mostly serving to keep the action going and to perhaps induce a few laughs rather than maintain the movie's believability. Our heroes from the first film, Rick and Evelyn, are now happily married as the O'Connells, and have travelled to an unknown temple with their son Alex to unravel the mystery of a dream Evelyn had. While that mystery has the edge on the film's plot development, the rest can hardly be described as such. Alex unwittingly slips on a cursed bracelet, and meanwhile Imhotep is being revived by a secret faction, whose goal is to defeat the Scorpion King and take control of Anubis' army - and by so doing rule the world. Thus a haphazard chain of reactions is set in motion including dirigibles, pygmy mummies, full-on battles between Medjai and (sigh) Anubis' warriors, and even a double-decker bus! When you've got all that together in a film, it somehow loses its integrity.The most serious problem is that the plot hardly makes any sense, and contradicts the first film numerous times, e.g. in bringing people back to life being strangely easier than in the first film, and the timeline being off, meaning that Alex should have been born before the first film took place! Oddly, NewLine Cinema decided to mitigate the latter with subsequent DVD releases of the original rather than the sequel, staging it a few years earlier! The only thing I find worth watching about ""The Mummy Returns"", apart from the mystery of Evelyn's dream and the excellently-crafted Anubis and army (courtesy of IL&M), are the interactions between the spotlight characters. Rick and Evy are endlessly entertaining as a couple (Rachel Weisz having matured a lot in her role since the first film), though not as much as John Hannah as the trouble-inducing Jonathan, almost solely responsible for the film's considerable comic level (apart from Izzy, the entertaining sky pirate). So an action adventure film this is, with all the comedy present just like in the first film. And yet the plot is so nonsensical and its development so haphazard that the film miserably fails at its attempt at being a solid piece of film-making - if indeed it was intended as such.Overall, ""The Mummy Returns"" feels more like an endless explosion of special-effects than much else, once again showcasing the brilliance and professionalism of Industrial Light & Magic (IL&M). Especially (groan) Anubis and his warriors are very aesthetic and well-done. But the haphazard, no-sense majority of this movie is not the deserving place for such talent and creation.",The Mummy Returns
233,klg19,Don't waste your money; wait for the video game,2,18 November 2001,"I found the first ""Mummy"" film to be rather a guilty pleasure. We were introduced to some fun and interesting characters, there was some snappy dialogue, and the effects were kind of nifty. It wasn't a great film, by a long stretch, and it certainly didn't give Brendan Fraser an opportunity to flash his considerable acting chops, but it was good summer fun.How disappointing to discover the sequel to be no pleasure at all, guilty or otherwise. The characters were cardboard cut-outs -- writer/director Sommers doesn't even bother to reintroduce us to any of them, much less develop them in any way at all, as if he didn't expect us to care about them; the dialogue makes ""wooden"" seem like an accolade; and the effects were so obviously computer-generated that they just looked cheesy. The point, I would think, of CGI is that the eye is fooled into believing that there is a desert plain filled with warriors, not into recognizing that there are about 100 actors in the foreground, and a teeming mass of pixels behind them.Worse, the money saved on box-top visuals wasn't spent on screenwriters or editors. The scenes are jump-cut out of all comprehension, and the dialogue seems to serve only for something to put on the soundtrack to break the stretches of John Williams-knockoffs. The director doesn't bother to pace the action, to build up from valleys into heights, most likely because he fears that slowing down at all would tip off the audience that there is no there there. Rarely does the viewer find any cause or effect between the characters' words and actions. When the hero's son is captured, the mother briefly grieves and the father sets his jaw, but one senses they do this because that's what parents are supposed to do, not because they are feeling the potential loss of their only childUntil I saw The Mummy Returns, I believed the worst film I had ever seen was George Clooney's zombie-state-inducing ""Batman and Robin."" I thought I would never see its like in terms of plot-deprivation, dialogic inanity, and gratuitous special effects.

My instincts proved correct; this movie is an awful lot of fun, the way the relationship evolved between Rick and Evie was great, and their son was an absolute hoot; not irritating like most child stars. The effects are already leaps and bounds ahead of Sommers' first Mummy, and I found the action to be breathtaking rather than overwhelming. To the critic who said it was like watching a videogame over someone's shoulder-- Did we see the same movie? Other great things about this one-- the Rock was perfect as the Scorpion King, despite his limited screen time, and I absolutely loved Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnation of Anck-su-Namun. This is definitely one case in which to ignore the critics completely and enjoy. I know I did.",The Mummy Returns
235,anifanmc,A well thought-out sequel,8,12 August 2008,"The original Mummy was a good movie, and it's immediate sequel deserves no less commendation. The characters, plot, and feel of the movie leave you wishing for more at the end, and most of its flaws are minor and easily overlooked in light of the movie as a whole.The story picks off where the first movie left, only about ten years later. Rick and Evie are married, they have a ten year old son, and they have a manor in England which they share with Evie's brother, Jonathan - but of course, their passion is still Egypt and they're off to explore more tombs with their slightly over-inquisitive son. In this case, Evie has been having visions of the past and it's led her to an ancient bracelet. Alex, being the annoying ten year old, puts on the bracelet and is promptly kidnapped along with Evie by a cult dedicated to the destruction of the Scorpion King, a mythical warlord. Of course, in their efforts, they've decided to resurrect Imhotep, the villain of the first film, and use him to kill the Scorpion King to take control of his army of Anubis warriors.Rick and Evie are, of course, not about to let this happen, especially not at the expense of their son, and they go on a long journey across Egypt and Africa to recover him. They realize that Evie's visions are from a past life and that she was the daughter of the Pharoah Seti, Nefertiti, who was the sparring rival of Anck-su-namun, lover of the Pharoah, and also the witness to the murder of the Pharoah. With the help of Ardeth Bay, the Med'jai warrior from the first film, they discover that Rick is also a reborn Med'jai warrior destined to bring about the demise of the Scorpion King.The film has some very high points. Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz are excellent actors and have a deep, almost explosive chemistry with each other, and with their on-screen son. Freddie Boath, as Alex, is hilarious, a great fusion of Rick and Evie, figuratively as well as literally. However the one character that I had my eye fixated on was Oded Fehr's Ardeth Bay. Not only is he the first Islamic warrior to be portrayed in a favorable light and leads the first full Islamic army since Lawrence of Arabia that is cast in a good light as well. He's the most emotional (and yet somewhat funny) character, and doesn't cling to the general stereotypes of an Arab that we tend to see in cinema nowadays. Jonathan is hilarious, and we get to see him showcase more than just his humor as he proves his worth in battle. And of course, Arnold Vosloo was fantastic as Imhotep, a villain to (almost) the very end and yet not a one-dimensional monster. His love affair with Anck-su-namun is more completely explored within the film and how it leads his actions is very obviously apparent.Compared to the first film, though, it feels slightly less like it's designed for its time than the first film, which felt distinctly placeable in the 1920s like advertised. The film still feels stuck in that time instead of a decade later during the stirrings of the Second World War. The cult henchmen also felt a bit bloated and disproportionately stupid even for a film where the good guy is near invincible.The references to the first film, far from coming off as cheesy, felt well placed and distinctly funny when it needed to be.Truly a movie worth renting. 8/10",The Mummy Returns
236,cB391,Meh,3,12 August 2018,"The second in a trilogy, though I am unsure if a third was intended at the completion of this film.
I just completed the trilogy and will sadly see the new film as well.The cinematography isn't bad. 
The story is worse than the first one.
The characters are about the same. The lone exception is the child, which meant that the film would be horrible. 
It is bad enough that the ""good"" characters have superhuman abilities to avoid any danger, they can also come back from the dead.I am unsure if this was used in the first or second film, but the phrase, ""Mortal weapons cannot hurt him/kill him."" He does seem to be able to get hurt with a few punches though. If a bullet doesn't hurt, why would a punch/rock/anything else?In conclusion, this is a stupid film. It is good if you want to sleep, as I did towards the end (the first time).
If you like it, you will probably be happy in life, as you like films that treat you like a child.It made a lot of money, which isn't shocking. Hopefully the people that paid for it had a horrible fate befall them. If you think that is harsh, good for you. The film is painfully bad, though not as bad as the third.",The Mummy Returns

John Hannah is the lame and unfunny comedy relief.

240,daved-3,less sense of fun than original,5,10 May 2001,"What I liked the most about the original Mummy was it's sense of how absurd it was--the fate of the world really wasn't at stake, it was all just an excuse for some fun.  That sense is missing from the sequel, where the filmmakers seem to think we will take it seriously if the world is threatened with apocalypse in 1933 (I suspect that if the world had been overrun by Annubis warriors in 1933 I would have read about it in my history books).   What I also find odd is that several scenes that were featured prominently in a ""The making of"" special on AMC were noticibly absent from the final film.  That indicates the film may have suffered from some last minute script/editing changes.  The special effects in the finale are also not that special, indicating last minute tinkering.  The Mummy Returns is competently done, but give me another Indiana Jones installment.",The Mummy Returns

Actually, Rocky is only in this flick about five minutes!  The rest of his character is computer animation. Anyway, if you seen the first Mummy, this one is very similar.a little scarya little funny.a little of everything. but not enough to make it a really good flick.

242,Peter Elefant,This film is quite silly!,8,3 June 2001,"But it is way better than Stephen Sommer's first attempt at the genre. He's not much of a director, but this time he has driven the special effects to such an excess (Love that word), that you simply can't not get caught up in the action of it. It's a rollercoaster-ride, that you've tried before, but that you can't help loving.It's an ""Indiana Jones"" rip'off (The bugs, the archeology, the time, the super-duper shoot-em-up hero), but who cares these days, right?
The effects range from really impressive, to down right silly, but the sound and music saves most of it. You believe it anyhow.. Maybe because you want to.Look folks! To put this short: You will NOT learn anything of value at all! You will NOT change your way of living after seeing this! But you can have a really great time, if only you leave that precious brain of yours in the door!8! I must be in a silly mood....",The Mummy Returns
243,Psycho Mantis,Bigger doesn´t certainly mean better,7,2 January 2002,"In the sequel to the very successful summer-hit of 1999 ""The Mummy"", director Stephen Sommers has made everything bigger and, according to himself, better. I can´t say that I agree with ""The Mummy Returns"" being better than its predecessor, but this is still fun stuff.Several years after their first adventure, Rick and Evelyn are back in Egypt to hunt for treasures. This time they have their ingenious son with them. After some trouble, they get home to London, but they´ve brought something with them that they shouldn´t have taken. Very soon an old friend of theirs is resurrected and the fun begins. In ""The Mummy Returns"", lots of the comedy from part one has been removed in favor of more special effects. Because there are lots of those here. Too many, I would say. Sure, they are great to look at (except for one certain effect towards the end, shame on you ILM), and helps the movie to keep the pace up. But it feels like Stephen Sommers should have trusted more on his actors, and less on the effects. The film has its moments, the Scorpion King not being one, and the fun rarely stops. The actors do a good job with the material they have, and it´s nice to see the beautiful actress Patricia Velasquez in a bigger role this time around. This is one of the better sequels I´ve seen in a long time.

Not that the original one was more realistic, but this movie feels like they were going more for the silly factor than a good adventure factor. It does have some good action but way too much silliness. For example.. if you're going to fight a mummy, you're not gonna do a 3 Stooges move & poke its eyes. That's just one of the many things that I didn't find too appealing. Other than that the movie was great!

245,DevastationBob-3,It was awful. It was offal.,1,3 May 2001,"All right,(shuddering intake of breath) here we go.This movie was bad.  Now look up bad in every english thesaurus ever made, and all the words there won't begin to describe how bad this movie was.I LIKED the first Mummy.  I give it a ten.  While there might have been a couple tiny bits that left a bad taste in my mouth, overall I thought it was great.  Stephen Sommers is an awesome writer/director, I've always enjoyed his films.  But this...When I saw the previews,  my mouth watered, it looked awesome.  Sure it had a kid in it, but I didn't think he'd weigh the film down.  They had all the original cast coming back, John Hannah, Oded Fehr... slam dunk, hole in one. But this...They took the first movie, then instead of taking all the good stuff, they just condensed the Bad Taste In My Mouth parts.  I'm amazed the Kid wasn't the worst thing about it.  Oh, he was Bad, but there's a lot of bad in this movie.  Historical innaccuracies, zero characterization, cliche's galore...any one of those I could have forgiven, but not all of them.This is a big, soulless, hollywood, summer movie.  This is Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  I hated Short Round...and I hated this Kid.  For the most part, it's a total rehash of stuff from the first movie.  I'd put in a SPOILER warning, but if you saw the first one, you know how this is gonna turn out.  Bad.  It's bad.The chick that played Ananck Su Namun is back, and apparently she wanted a speaking role this time.  Bad Idea.  The Rock out acted her.  Not the wrestler, one of the rocks on film.  Not that good acting would have saved this plotless chunk of filth.  If you want decent characterization, I guess they thought it would carry over from the first movie.  The actors were there for filler in between pointless special effects, and dumb fight scenes.  (If you're a fan of either, forget what I've said, go see it, enjoy.)Plot holes, oh the plot holes.  Big enough to pass the Giza Pyramid through. How did Oded GET to england, much less to Rick's mansion?  He says he's never been on a bus before.  Evie is a kung-fu chick?  Why didn't these neato abilities kick in in the first movie??? They sure as heck woulda been useful.  Rick is a magi?  Does he need a DAMN reason to fight the mummy? Flashback to Ancient Egyptian Foxy Boxing, why?  The huge honkin' tropical rainforest...around a PYRAMID...in the middle of a DESERT!!!  No one noticed this before?  Seems odd in a world filled with ROCKET POWERED BALLOONS!!! Sorry, suspension of disbelief only goes so far...jets...we didn't even HAVE JETS THEN!!! That guy would have made some serious money with his inventions.  I know the Germans woulda been interested...And the special effects...sure, they're impressive...but they don't make a movie ""Good"" in my book.  Case in point, Dragonheart.  Nuff said.  Goin' to see a bad movie for good special effects is akin to goin' to the circus to gawk at the ""Freak Show"".  Well, looky that.  If that don't beat all! They're nice, they're gravy...but I'd rather have a well made movie.  And the Scorpion/Rock...man, flashback to Clash of the Titans.  Ray Harryhausen is turnin' over in his grave...if he's dead.  I hope not, Ray's a good man. But this...guh.I'm not alone in my feelings either.  Pretty much all in the theater felt this way.  When the balloon thrusters kicked in, I screamed and threw a bottle of mountain dew at the screen.  Many others followed suit.Okay...guess that's it.  I tried to stay calm and rational...I guess I coulda sent in a comment that was just full of screaming and profanity...which was going on in the car on the way home...but I figured this has a better chance of being put up as a warning.  If you liked the first one at all, I don't think you'll like this one much.  If you're just looking for a stupid summer movie...go ahead, it's YOUR soul. Peace.",The Mummy Returns
246,Aphex97,Lame,5,19 May 2001,"Two of the best elements of the original Mummy were great effects and a bad ass monster. I loved the Mummy in the original. He was tough, mean, quick, had plenty of cool tricks up his sleeve, and most importantly: he was damn menacing. The Mummy returns in the sequel but is considerably tamer. The action sequences involving him are considerably lamer, and the effects much poorer in both quality and originality.  The opening intro telling the tale of the Scorpion King is the only time this movie really shines in both terms of interest and CGI effects. The rest of the movie's plot and special effects seem to have been just slapped together as fast and haphazardly as possible. The plot is considerably lamer than the original (not to mention much more incoherent and with even greater continuity problems). The curator of Evie's museum along with a bunch of not too interesting henchmen are digging up the Mummy to fight the Scorpion King to gain control of the army of Annubis. Once they have control they are going to (get ready for the shocker) *gasp* try to take over the world. There is some ridiculous subplot about the Evie being the direct descendant (identical twin no less) of the murdered Pharaoh's daughter. She starts having visions that provide information to plod the ridiculous plot along. Imoteph's (the Mummy) girlfriend has been reincarnated. How/Why is never explained. The viewer is supposed to accept this on blind faith. Another ridiculous new element is suddenly Frasier has a holy stamp on his hand that makes him a chosen warrior of God....where were these elements in the first movie? Rick and Evie are now the perfect (and excessively boring) nuclear family with a young kid who I think is supposed to be Anakin Skywalker. The dialogue gets a 10 on the cheese scale. All the good guys are completely uninteresting. The bad guys aren't menacing in the least.  The effects are lackluster best, and the incoherent plot has holes big enough to drive a Buick through. The final showdown sported the worst effects of the whole movie. The Scorpion King was pretty lame and looked like something you'd see on a Playstation.  FINAL RATING: 5/10 A generally mediocre presentation of what could have been a good sequel. Somewhat entertaining but doesn't hold a candle to the original.",The Mummy Returns

It was a very good film especially for a sequel to a remake. It was more action than the first one and had less build up time. because we've been introduced to the characters except 2 it just jumps into the action. this one was more humorous mainly because it had more of the cocky O'connell being that way.

Because of the commercials, I was lead to believe that the Rock would have a major role in the movie (the character, the Scorpion King, had a major role, not the Rock himself).  As a result, I was mislead but not disappointed.Although the Rock did not have a major role in the movie, I found it to be thrilling, humourous and action-packed.  All in all, it was the best movie I had seen in a while.  In fact, in some cases, this movie was far superior than the first.  Not only that, but the movie contained much of the continuity of the first and featured many of the same actors as well.Also, if you haven't seen the movie yet, watch the previous movie first. This will re-familiarize you with the characters, their motivations, evil creatures, magical artifacts, certain locales in Egypt, etc.  This will prevent you from having to remember who a certain character was.Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and Freddie Boath all performed quite well (from an entertainment point of view), and I would be extremely interested to see them all in another Mummy sequel (it can be done, because after all, we're talking about Hollywood here).Unfortunately, the movie was not perfect.  The ending was disappointing.  I will not describe it, but what I found disappointing was the use of poor computer animated graphics rather than a live action shot.Because of the ending, I only gave it 9 out of 10 stars.",The Mummy Returns

Acting was terrible and slow, stacks of miscasts.  This movie is a cut-paste from: ""Death on The Nile"" & ""Ten Commandments"" - The special effects in King Kong was more believable than this movie.  If you are not busy catching some ZZzzz's then count the thousands of mistakes (chronological & historical) that make up this bomb of a movie.

While I'm not sorry I saw the sequel, I was disappointed in that it wasn't nearly as clever or as well done as the first.The producers of ""The Mummy Returns"" didn't even bother to fill in all of those tiny little plot holes. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** Like, how did the Maji character manage to make it to the temple and escape the little pygmie creatures that nailed everyone else?  They also never really explained the full Scorpion story very well in the very beginning.I wasn't expecting to think very deeply about this movie since it's just pure, silly entertainment at its most mindless.  Mummy Returns still retains its old fashioned action film appeal and I still enjoyed it enormously.  I even liked the campy one liners that I might have found annoying in another movie. Brendan Fraser helped a great deal in making ""The Mummy Returns"" a fun experience.  The special effects are great and the movie still scares.  I was surprised to see so many young kids in the audience with a PG-13 rating.I'd recommend it but I hope it won't be the best of this summer.

252,Lunchbox-8,One of the worst movies ever made,4,24 May 2001,"Not only is this one of the worst movies ever made, but in my opinion it was extremely funny.  It wasn't meant to be funny though.  At the meant to be funny parts I shuddered due to the cliched movie hogwash I was hearing. Some parts were just unbearable.  There were so many stupid mistakes that the directors made that were in the film.  I don't mean like seeing a shadow or a boom mike on accident, I mean things that just don't make any damn sense.  For Example:  When the team of adventurous, pulp comic, Indiana Jones rip-off team of heroes were traveling in a blimp made out of wood, they had a fire in the blimp.  I don't mean in a secluded little stone alcove made for bonfires, I mean right on the wooden floor of the blimp. This is what I saw!  And then, later, when the heroes were trying to escape impending doom from a previously KILLED AND SENT TO HELL mummy monster guy, they escaped on their blimp in a very fake manner.  They didn't deflate the balloon or anything that stupid, they used advanced rocket technology...with seemingly no harsh burns or accidents...in 1935...when rocket technology was unheard of...on an independent charterer's seemingly pieced together by junk blimp.  Just great. That made a whole lot of sense.  The scenes in this movie just didn't make sense.  When Brendan Frasier and that magi guy are stalking through a museum, they encounter many live mummies...trapped in glass...brought back from the dead.  That all seems okay.  But when this seemingly terrifying ordeal was over, they seem unfase, the don't even mention the incident...ever.  And what is the deal with Imhotep or whatever. He was dragged to Hell at the end of Mummy part one, right?  Well, now somehow they dug him up only to find him encased in some sort of bug carcass loookin thing.  HOW?  HOW?  HOW?  THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!!!  I couldn't control myself at many parts of the movie from making both snyde remarks and immense outbursts of rude laughter.  Oops!  The cliched gun fights with the average enough lookin Arabs were once again, completely stupid.  The same thing happened again and again.  A bunch of Egyptians clad in the average turbin and desert fatigue (IN LONDON!!!) with NO ACCURACY FIRING THE AUTOMATIC WEAPON were killed almost instantly any time the good guy pointed a gun at them.

Asequel is a certain thing, and The Mummy 3 is just a question of time.And we can also be sure that the graphics effects will be, if notbetter, at least more grandiose. The computer graphics were the biggest disappointment for me. Theywere well planned, but there is still something lacking in thesoftware to make them look real. The scorpion king was the worst partof it, but all the computer generated scenes stand out as artificiallooking. Let's just hope the next couple of years bring enoughtechnical development to make the next sequel perfect.The plot, well, what kind of plot do you expect from a film called""The Mummy Returns""? It may not have been written by Shakespeare, butthe story carries well and there is the right amount of tension andcomic relief. Two very lovely ladies. The only thing that bothered mewas a certain abundance of characters. One feels they could havecombined the kid, the brother in law, and the balloon pilot into one.The dispute between the women, reaching back a few millennia, is asimportant as the dispute between the male characters. I kept trying tograsp which was the ""main"" plot line without success. The museumcurator has a small part in the beginning, but hovers around appearingbriefly several times. If I had written the story, I would have thatobnoxious person meet a particularly gruesome end once Imhotep hadbeen resuscitated. Perhaps the idea in the story alternating equallybetween so many people was to bring the main focus to the specialeffects.I see a definitive improvement in this kind of film over the""classics"" of the 1930's. In those days, horror films were deadserious. It was as if they were telling the spectators ""hey folks,never mind the lousy special effects, this thing is for real"".Nowadays, they say ""it's just a movie, sit back and enjoy the show"".I give it a 8/10 and can't wait for ""The Mummy Returns Again"".",The Mummy Returns
255,brijess-2,Extremely Disappointing.,4,5 May 2001,"THE MUMMY was a surprise hit in 1999. It at all of the elements of the great INDIANA JONES films with a lot of originality. Plus the characters were all likeable and the dialogue was extremely witty.  This year, we are presented with THE MUMMY RETURNS, a highly disappointing sequel that is loud, noisy and impersonal. The movie opens with background information on The Scorpion King. This is handled well and this movie could have been just about him. Then, without ever getting a title credit, we move to Egypt of 1933. We already see our heroes stumbling upon relics that relate to The Scorpion King. They find an artifact and take it with them, but unknowingly start a booby trap. Needless to say, they escape back to London with their son, who places the artifact on his wrist and has 7 days to find The Scorpion Kings lair before he dies. This is an interesting movie itself, but no, we forgot about The Mummy. Well, an Anck-Su-Namun look-a-like and others try to resurrect The Mummy so that he can kill The Scorpion King and be `more powerful.' Confused? I sure was.The plot to THE MUMMY RETURNS is simply a mess. It has too much going on and doesn't stop to let you relate and enjoy the characters. They give you just enough plot to put action sequences around them. The dialogue, while clever at times, is delivered horribly to even attempt to be witty or interesting. Sure, they are saying something but we really don't care, because if it isn't a Mummy soldier chasing them, it is little pigmy skeletons pulling everyone down under the grass similar to the raptor scene in JURASSIC PARK II.  The things that made the first one so good (fun characters, good acting) are abandoned for non-stop and numbing action sequences. And on top of that, the movie isn't scary at all. At least the first film had its tense moments. And when the story tries to be tender and serious, you can't help but think, `It'll be OK.' The special effects are also a problem. It seems as if the filmmakers want to show the effects to you so quickly that they abandon all tension or horror that the first film tried. You can help but think of the droid army in THE PHANTOM MENANCE when you see the `dog' army in the desert. How many times do we need to see a mummy or another creature stretch their mouth open wide? It was done a lot in the first film. Seeing it now didn't make it more interesting. And when we finally see The Scorpion King, we are just so overwhelmed that we just want it to be over. It was fun seeing the characters again and how they changed. O'Connell didn't change much. He was given some parental instincts, but the script made them seem forced. Evelyn is much more physical than she was before. She isn't afraid to make a fist and fight and some of this leads to her interesting past. Jonathan is back but he is given the worst dialogue, so it makes him look even more idiotic. The rest of the cast does a good job but is given little to do, including The Mummy himself. I just can't help but feel disappointed and bored with THE MUMMY RETURNS. If they had taken the time to stop and let us enjoy the characters rather than the effects, this could have been a better film.",The Mummy Returns

But then. Oh Boy! This has to be a prime example of all that is wrong with the Hollywood summer blockbuster. Yes you must suspend disbelief & go with the flow but this film has nothing of merit. The acting is awful with wooden performances all-round amidst very poor (not so) special effects, in particular the laughable Scorpion King at the end. Most of the effects would not look out of place on your standard games console & look rushed & cheap. I wouldn't be surprised if they were quickly done to get the film out. Its a movie made by special effects geeks for special effects geeks. The original was a pretty good adventure film but this is a real Indiana Jones wannabe without the likable characters,wit,style or coherent plot just a series of set-pieces cut together.

However, that said, I remember walking out of the theatre with a huge grin on my face.  I really enjoyed this movie.  This cast works exceedingly well together, and they didn't just rehash the same old jokes again.  The storyline's quite different, and the action scenes are, if anything, better. Yes, there are plotholes, particularly when you combine the two stories of the original movie and the sequel, and the immense commercial throughought the movie for the Scorpion King movie with the Rock was horrificaly bad. (At least that movie went down like a lead balloon.  Imagine, a wrestler trying to do an egyptian warrior.  Doesn't work for me.  Then again, I didn't see that one.  I wasn't interested.)

There are still a few little problems though. The dialogue is a sometimes stilted and inappropriate, and the little boy seemed to be not much more than a device to move the plot along, for all the attention he was given by his parents. What saves the movie are the wonderful performances by Oded Fehr, Arnold Vosloo, Ms. Velasquez, the actor playing the brother-in-law and the guy flying the balloon ship thing.

The book for the sequel is alot better but if a lot of stuff had been in the movie that was in the book than the movie would have been rated R.  And you know that the unviversal people know that r rated movies don't work with kid.  I thought the first one was very original.  There was just something about it that made go yeah this is going to be a winner with me.  But as usual when you try to hype a sequel and expect it to be better.  Well 9 times out of 10 it is a miss but since the original did make 140 million in the us.  I suspect that the sequel will surpass it.  Some things that did impress me where the special effects.  I thought that the rock was perfect for the role ,and I don't even like the wwf.  Next  I thought that it was great to see a returning cast of pretty much everyone makes it even better.  But the plot had too many plot holes and didn't impress me.  I won't say don't go see it but just be warned that you might be dissapointed as I was.  I gave this and 8/10 for The Rocks perfomance and for the special effects other wise it was just okay.\Since this is the summer watch for reviews by me.  I will give a review and then a review out of 10",The Mummy Returns
261,iprudd,The traitorous wife returns with avengence!,9,27 May 2001,"Although some of the shock is not there this time round because you know what is coming in parts, this may well be a cinematic rarity, a sequel that is a good as the original.The film opens with Rick and Evie, now the happily married couple snooping around a tomb with their son in tow. Evie has been having some strange dreams about this dig, which is confirmed when she is able to open the tomb using keys which she knows nothing about. They fight of the baddies, a la Indiana Jones and go back to England with a bracelet belonging to the Scorpian King. The heavies want this as Anck-su-namum is planning on raising Imhotep again and using the Scorpian King's bracelet to rule the world. Queue the non stop action. Alex is kidnapped as he puts on the bracelet and can only remove it at the Temple belonging to the Scorpian King.
Ardeth Bey aids them in their quest. The CGI is, as you would expect superb. This time round the girls get to beef up their fight scenes. Rachel Weisz certainly can do this. The two fight scenes between her and Velazquez and excellent. Fraser proves once again that he is ideal for this sort of part.I cannot recommend this enough. GO AND SEE IT.",The Mummy Returns
262,Subzero7,Wonderful!!,10,21 May 2001,"I really liked this film.  While it didn't have quite the edge the first one had, it was every bit as fun with plenty of silly humor and of course grand special effects to go with it.  I hope they make another film with the same actors.  Maybe a different story but another.  This could be another franchise like Indiana Jones.  :)",The Mummy Returns
263,aleator,Distinctly sub-Indiana Jones,4,20 May 2001,"Even for a childrens movie, 'The Mummy returns' leaves a lot to be desired. Takes away the doctored soundtrack, the endless musical crescendos and the now all too familiar digital fx and what have you got? A hollow movie devoid of any real storyline with some of the worst acting I have seen in years - hardly surprising given the leaden script. The movie fails abysmally (as did the first one) because it can't decide whether to play it entirely for fun or go for genuine shocks. The film picks up a bit towards the end with the appearance of the Army of the Undead and I quite liked the Scorpion king. Despite the endless noise I slept through much of it.",The Mummy Returns
264,FilmSchoolWriter,"A fabulous ride! (And I'm talking about the movie, not the roller-coaster)",9,6 May 2006,"I loved The Mummy so, of course, I had to see The Mummy Returns as well. At first, I was wary of seeing it. The majority of movie sequels crash and burn hopelessly, ruining the originals forever. Thankfully, The Mummy Returns returns doesn't do that! This is at least as good as it's predecessor. A few alarm bells went off in my head when I first started watching this movie, but none of them were necessary. When I first saw that Evie and Rick had a kid (Alex), I was like, ""Oh crap. This is going to suck."" But it didn't! Freddie Boath actually does a really good job playing Alex. He wasn't annoying and he never got in the way of the action. The part was well written and he executed it well.Props to Stephen Sommers for bringing back his entire leading cast. The Mummy Returns wouldn't have been half as good if any of the characters had been recast. The ever spectacular Rachel Weisz once again does a wonderful job playing Evie. The same for Brendan Frasier. When I first saw The Mummy, I was really worried about having Frasier in an action/adventure role. Face it, the guy isn't exactly the most serious actor. But he rocks, no one else could have played Rick like he can. Oded Fehr is wonderful as Ardeth Bay. I'm really glad that they decided not to kill off his character at the end of The Mummy. But for me, John Hannah once again stole the show. I love him as Jonathan! In every scene he's in, I can't take my eyes off of him. He's incredibly entertaining - just like an actor should be.Stephen Sommers is a great director. Granted, his films are exactly going to win the Oscar for Best Picture, but the visual effects really are stunning. His movies garb me and always entertain me, regardless.So the moral of the story is, RENT THE MUMMY RETURNS! It's a fabulous ride and you won't regret it. A very solid 9/10.",The Mummy Returns
265,Bondo20,Surprisingly Intelligent,8,5 February 2002,"The Mummy series may be the most underrated I've seen.  Boththe first and not the second feature fairly deep Egyptianmythological based plots with action piled in.  The second onereally accomplishes things better with more character interactionand history.  And while it doesn't lack action, that shouldn't be theonly focus from the audience.  Unless you just can't stand action inmovies this is a fun and interesting movie.",The Mummy Returns
266,TobyS,"With so much going on, I still got bored...",5,13 September 2001,"I really liked The Mummy when it came out.  It reminded me (and everybody else it seems) as an Indiana Jones film.  It was fun and focused, so it was inevitable that a sequel would be put into production.  No big deal, the first one was good, second one should be as well, right? Wrong.Writer/director Stephen Sommers packs this film with so much action that I actually got bored with watching it.  He never spends enough time on anything for the viewer to focus on.  One explosion, a few semi-funny one-liners, and on to the next scene.  Arnold Vosloo as The Mummy is back, but unfortunately, this isn't his movie.  Yes, he's in most of it, but I don't actually remember much of him beyond the canyon wave (essentially the sand face from the first film, only with water).  This film belongs to the Scorpion King, which brings me to him...As far as The Rock as the Scorpion King go, what's the big deal?  For the few minutes he's in it (and I emphasize few minutes), he's either snarling and fighting, or he's snarling and running, or he's snarling as a very badly computer generated scorpion.  I'm wondering if Sommers just ran out of money, or perhaps energy when it came to completing the film, because the effects in the last 15 minutes are really horrible.  There are good parts though.  The canine warriors are spectacular, and the little tiny mummy creatures are campy, but hilarious.  Plot?  Forgetaboutit. There is not plot to speak of.  Actually, to be honest, I can't even remember what the plot was to have supposed to involve beyond another little thing-a-ma-jig that would bring the Scorpion King back from the dead, and the reincarnated Anck Su Namun still trying to reunite herself with good 'ole Imhotep. Oh, and Brenden Fraser and Rachel Weisz are now married with a kid (the Action Movie Guide Book says it's better to involve children in those perilous situations for more suspense).Now, come to find out, Universal is in production on a movie based solely on the Scorpion King.  I certainly hope that they find a plot, invest more in some special effects, and let The Rock get his snarl back in practice, because I'm sure the critics are already practicing theirs.My grade: C-",The Mummy Returns
267,Phoenix-107,Stupid.,3,8 June 2001,"That's exactly how I felt after walking out of The Mummy Returns. A huge fan of the first movie, buying not only the VHS when it came out, but also the Ultimate Edition DVD, I was counting the days til this movie came out. I could not have been more disappointed. A weak plot, weaker acting by quality actors, incredibly ludicrous special effects (See! Brendan Fraser outrunning sunlight! See! Computerized The Rock giving his trademark eyebrow to Fraser!). After watching the MTV Movie Awards last night, I enjoyed the Jimmy Fallon/Kirsten Dunst/Rob Schneider/Snoop Dogg(!) parody much more than the actual movie. It's a good thing I work at a theatre and can see movies for free, because I would have asked for my money (and IQ points) back. As it was, I was almost tempted to do so anyways. I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't like to think during movies, and needs to be visually entertained to enjoy a movie. Judging by the insane box office totals, there are certainly a lot of you.",The Mummy Returns
268,kersus,Fluff Sequel,4,15 January 2008,"The Mummy Returns is a quick fluff action piece with some poor slapstick comedy. It uses numerous Deus Ex Machina for the sake of using them. One might feel there's the use of retconning here too, but again, even those were completely out of place.It is pretty much a family movie (far more so than the first one) but some young children could be scared by the mummies. For the most part it is upbeat and doesn't ever give you the feeling that anything will go wrong.Synopsis: Bad guy comes back to beat another bad guy to rule the world and the good guys try to stop them all. Most of the characters do a lot of traveling and then have a showdown. Mixed in is some chumming of the good guys that leads no where. Plus they add fate/destiny stuff just to make sure we don't get any more sequels.It assumes the audience has attachment to the characters and assumes you feel the good guys are a tight group but never really builds that up. It's hard to tell if the movie was just poorly made, or if there was really a much grander and broader story that had to be cut down to a couple hours.The acting is okay except for Patricia Velasquez who seemed wooden, but that might have been the directing and not her. She was quite sexy, so it balances out. Rachel Weisz was far sexier in this movie than the first, and the rest of the cast does okay; certainly Brendan Fraser is very comfortable in his role as Richard 'Rick' O'Connell.If you watch it right after the first movie, you'll notice clearly that the CGI is a lot worse in returns. This adds to the idea that it was just a poorly written movie to cash in on the first movie's success. Besides the poor CGI, the action sequences really are quite well done. They're easy to follow, are fast paced, and include more dynamics than the rest of the movie.This is a different movie than the first one. It's less Indiana Jones and more.... well think of a bad kids movie that's supposed to be an adventure but seems silly.It really doesn't feel like it meshes with the first movie (especially the love between Anck Su Namun and Imhotep), and while it introduces the Scorpion King idea, it again doesn't mesh with that movie at all. Unfortunately I think it ended this franchise when it really should have spring-boarded a series of movies had it been done with more thought.With all of that said, ultimately it is a fun movie if you don't care about verisimilitude and as I said, most people would see it as fun for the whole family. It just lacks depth, solid writing, directing, and decent CGI. If you can snag it cheap, you'll feel like you got your money's worth. It isn't one of those movies where you just feel cheated for your time. It's okay, fluffy fun; just turn off your brain first.",The Mummy Returns
269,kitfox30,"For a sequel, not bad SPOILERS",7,10 June 2017,"There were a few flaws in this movie I wanted to point out. Their son, Alex is eight. If you took the year they met and added it up until the time setting that is only seven years, which meant he couldn't be Rick's son unless he had a one night stand with Evie that neither remembered.In the first movie Ardeth Bay never tells them what his name is, it is never mentioned, but in the second movie they greet him by name.As sequels go it was pretty good. An added bonus is buying the DVD two disc version that gives you much back history on the people and characters depicted in the movie. It also has a blooper reel that still makes me laugh. I do enjoy it and the first one too including that beautiful white cat that should've been around for the whole movie. The third one i found a little silly and completely unnecessary, but this was not a bad movie, it really did have some great moments.",The Mummy Returns

It's the same formula, so if you enjoy the first, you'll likely enjoy the second. However, the movie gets rid of all attempts to scare the viewer, which was a bit disappointing.

I wonder how the actors went, they must have got sick of cavorting in front of blue screens and dodging monsters who wouldnt appear until post production. I saw this as a double feature along with the first one, which is far more substantial and involving. The acting was ok, but the live action seemed to have less screen time than all the animation.

Those are the pros, now the cons: some very stupid and lame jokes, special effects could've been better, and (SPOILERS) there was a scene in which Rachel Weiss's character dies and then comes back to life later in the film.

The plot itself is pretty interesting and well done, which is fairly unusual for a big sequel like this.  Unfortunately, the film spends most of its time on overdone action sequences.  When I say overdone, I'm talking about the fact that there is tons of CGI and martial arts style fighting, and everyone knows that you sacrifice quality for quantity.  What we're left with is a bunch of endless scenes where no take is over 2 seconds long in order to disguise the poor quality CGI and fighting skills of the actors.  It gives you a headache after a while.  However, most of the CGI where they actually give you time to look at it is beautiful and quite creative (with the exception of the final action scene, which is pretty pitiful).  Overall, the film is probably worth seeing if you like action films, but you'll walk out of the theater feeling like you've been beaten over the head with a club!",The Mummy Returns

However, what I am most excited to relate is you get a whole lot more! Coming away from the movie, what I am most impressed with is it's grasp of honor, love and good vs evil. There is no grey here. True love brings out honor, good rocks, and evil will always let you down. This is displayed with great passion, and it stuck with me.

If you enjoy Xena on TV (I don't) or the even lamer Hercules (is that still on?) then this movie is for you. Otherwise wait for a rental.The character who deserves a spinoff of his own is the Magi guy who is very heroic.

All good horror flicks establish the rules which the good and bad guys cannot pass, which creates suspense and tension.

I'm a big fan of good action films, and even a lot of semi-good ones, and a big fan of pulp. I'm a big fan of special effects, if they're justified by the movie they're in.But this is flat-out one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The writing and direction are simply atrocious, beyond bad.  Scenes are shot as if without any forethought or planning or concept of what they'll look like on the screen.  The story is so stupid that it's outright insulting -- not because it's about dead people coming to life, and so forth, but because it makes almost no sense at all and yet still manages to be completely predictable.Dull story, bad action scenes, boring characters, tedious visuals, lame special effects -- just a colossal waste of money and talent.  They spent about $100 million making this, and it looks like maybe $25 million.  Not that it would be worth that.Not half as good as ""Deep Rising"", by the same writer-director, and *that* wasn't exactly a great movie.

280,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,Could have been a video game movie.,1,12 July 2001,"Here, at last and for your consideration, is a film that is so very nonsensical the term movie doesn't even apply to it. The Mummy Returns is basically a rehash of  the action sequences from such blockbusters as Raiders of the Lost Ark, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Lost World: Jurassic Park (you'd have to be pretty desperate to rip off that last one, right?). I'd go through all of The Mummy Returns' 'influences' here, or at least more of them, if it wasn't such a behemoth task. And then 'writer/ director' Stephen Sommers connects these action sequences through something which only by videogame standards (ten years ago) could be called a plot.But then, you may ask, sometimes you don't watch movies for intelligent plotting, clever subtexts, deep and moving performances or even a coherent and fitting visual style. Sometimes all you want is your money's worth in excitement, adrenaline, thrills and spills. While spills are abundant here, the other three are sadly passed by. There's an uninspired (but expensive!) bus chase through Londen, one-and-a-half CTHD-style choppily edited (but expensive!) fight sequences and innumerable predictable (but expen..- oh, who cares) scenes featuring CGI creatures. Yes, The Mummy Returns certainly has its fair share of visual effects, although the quality is often debatable. But its main problem is, the excitement, adrenaline and thrills never take off, because Sommers does not only forget to establish any real kind of threat, he also doesn't make us care about the characters. Sommers seems to argue that effects equal excitement, but they do not.Now, to be honest, I never saw The Mummy (nor am I very anxious to). When it came out in 1999, after The Matrix had proven action could be done in a stylish and clever way, I never really felt like seeing another popcorn no-brainer. And to be honest, I can't think of a single pure no-brainer since The Matrix that I really enjoyed (unless you're counting Gladiator). But still, at least with M:I-2, X-Men, and even Hollow Man I found highlights and I could follow something of a storyline.

Boy did I get all of that in spades. It sickens me that a movie with such a completely hideous plot and script can rake in money like this one has so far. This movie is a perfect example of the movie going audience sending a message to the studios saying, ""don't worry about an interesting story, don't worry about descent acting, don't worry about having characters that you care about, just crank up the CGI machines and let special effects carry your films.""

They will for the simple fact that it is big. Big in special effects to the point of overkill, I mean this bad-boy feels just like a computer game. The problem with a lot of computer games is that they don't have a plot, well dito for Mummy Returns.It was evident from the first one that Sommers just hasn't got a clue how to write, I mean there are barely any standout moments of dialogue and the fact that it feels like the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles is a bad thing. It feels like an infant has pencilled a few odd words and the whole thing has been jumbled around and strectched into a screenplay. There is simply no struture to the script, not plotting devices, no moments of dramatic tension and no reason for anything that does happen, to actually happen.The film is bad to worse material. The ever reliable Brendan Frazer is, as ever, reliable. Weisz is OK but Hannah does a risible effort at comedy. There is no point in billing the rock up as he is blink and you'll miss him material. It is a crying shame that so much money should be heaped into such a lame and contrived piece of writing. Fear not though as it is not only writing which is haphazard but the direction itself. Whenever there seems to be some sort of motion to the piece there is an unneeded 10 minutes of slow silent nothingness.I cannot help but be subjective because the objective opinion would probably make people feel as though this is a decent movie.

The movie is not without some merit (after all, it did have Brendan Fraser in it) but the few good bits are way outweighed by all the truly awful stuff.

As someone who grew up on Harryhausen-style fantasy fables (like the Sinbad films), I can confidently say that Mummy returns is probably the closest modern cinema has come to that age of pure adventure, when it was all about the heroes taking on supernatural evils and such.  All the flaws here amount to virtually diddly squat compared to the sheer bang for the buck you get.  Like the 1998 Mummy film, what we have here is a wonderful, ""pulp"" serial adventure, harkening back to the days of jungle adventures and such.  Mummy is often criticized for borrowing a lot from other movies, but yet oddly enough, it does it better than the movies it's borrowing from.  I also hear Indiana Jones rip-off, bandied around alot, failing to note that Indiana Jones was, itself, a tribute to classic adventure serials, and ripped off tons of stuff from those.  Ignore the critics on this one, because they seem to be taking the wrong view of this kind of movie.  I could see bad reviews if this were touted as a Shakespearean masterpiece or a triumph of Oscar-worthy acting, but it isn't.  At no time has this film ever been advertised as anything but a fantasy adventure, pure and simple.  Why is it so hard for people to make that division between works that SHOULD be artistically examined, and works that shouldn't?

That's what you get when the story is made in function of the FX and  not the other way around, like it should be. The action pieces are all boring and are all done much better in other movies (Indiana Jones for example).

291,Gordon-38,Well...it was noisy and there were lots of monsters.,6,19 May 2001,"I wasn't bored watching ""The Mummy Returns"", which is about all I can say for it.  The problem was that I was never really involved, excited or interested.  Brendan Fraser maintains his vague, undefinable, barely-there charisma.  Rachel Weisz is still kinda-sorta-attractive-but-not-really and her acting hasn't improved any.  The little kid is, like most little kids in the movies, roughly 7,000 times smarter than any of the adults in the picture, far too smart to really be 8 years old, full of ""hilarious"" wisecracks, and massively annoying.The ultimate problem, though, is that it doesn't really succeed as a summertime special effects movie - it doesn't contain a single FX shot that made me sit up and take notice.  Granted, this is becoming harder and harder to do, but ""The Mummy Returns"" didn't even try.  They just had all the same effects from the first movie, except more of them.But there were some swordfights, lots of shootouts, plenty of monsters, and the volume was turned way, way up.  Also, the popcorn was pretty tasty, the root beer was okay...and I didn't fall asleep once during the movie.  So...I guess...that's a plus.  Of sorts.",The Mummy Returns
292,humpback,Something different,7,10 June 2001,"Saw the first ""Mummy"" and loved it. Even gave it 9 out of 10 points. Saw it three times. Bought the DVD. Went To Egypt. Started robbing Tombs...The Mummy Returns (M2) is different, a nice sequel if a slightly weaker. While ""The Mummy"" was an ""adventurers stumble across terrific ancient curse"" movie in the tradition of Indiana Jones ( and a good one at that !), ""The Mummy Returns"" is more of a ""free for all adventure extravanganza"". No real secrets or mysteries, little suspense or plot twists, huge amounts of supernatural ( read ILM ) fireworks.To be precise - while M1 built up the supernatural side of the story slowly and very deliberately over the first hour, increasing the sense of mystery and the audience's expectation to good effect, M2 hits the viewer full in the face within the first 10 minutes.  Soldier mummies on speed, undead warriors of Anubis, huge ILM-animated battles and deadly trap-riddled tombs abound - after this the pace only increases only a little and tries to keep the audience glued to their seats for the remaining 2 hours from the sensory overkill from the beginning of the story. Almost all the mystery and supernatural effects are introduced in the initial onslaught, and what remains is reserved for the final 30 minutes ( except for the ultra-cool ""Mygmies"", who get far too little time and exposure, IMHO ) which again is furious, breath taking and entirely ""over the top"". The ""time shift"" scenes, as well as the airship sequence do not offer anything great or original, but are nice eye-candy. The plot is not all that unique either. Still, its likable.The smart, poignant dialogues and character interactions which made ""The Mummy"" special, unfortunately are far rarer and less witty, and what remains of it requires a good working knowledge of ""The Mummy"" to really enjoy. Also, there is no real villain for the viewer to hate, dislike or fear like slimy ""Benny"" from the first part or the mummy Imhotep himself who never seems really terrifying or threatening throughout the movie and the ""Ultimate Evil"" Scorpion king remains a plot device straight out of the script (""look, the wicked archfiend !""), a major mistake in my book. Heroes need great villains to shine.As for the cast, the character development of the protagonists from ""The Mummy"" is notable and plausible (in my book), if not spectacular, the acting solid ( especially John Hannah ) with the single noteworthy exception of Patricia Velasquez. As for her, great looks do not great actors make.... sorry most of the statues and background scenery deliver a better mimic performance ! 'nuff said !Overall, its an enjoyable movie and I expect much weaker offings this summer, but ""The Mummy Returns"" would, on its own merits that is, not fly very far or successfully. One really need to have seen ""The Mummy"" to fully enjoy the second part.....

293,existenz-6,"Some good effects, no plot",1,6 May 2001,"Mummy Returns had a few good things going for it, but none of them have to do with plot or entertainment value.  The effects were okay for the most part, although the Scorpion King monster at the end was awful.  The second unit photography and many of the Egyptian vistas were beautiful, and the sets were pretty good ripoffs of those in the Indiana Jones movies.Out of all the actors, clearly Brendan Fraser was the worst.  He was boring, he had nothing to do, and he wasn't funny at all.  Oded Fehr was the best actor in the movie, along with the Rock.  Unfortunately the Rock is only in the first five minutes of the movie, and he has almost no lines of dialogue. His CGI appearance at the end, of course, was forgettable.This movie could have been much better -- right now it has a lot of boring, unoriginal moments.",The Mummy Returns
294,pmoney13,this movie is awful,1,14 June 2001,"I went to see this movie expecting a fun, stupid, and entertaining time-waster that I could at least enjoy. But thirty minutes into it I realized that this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot was obvious, the special effects were terrible, and I was crying for this movie to come to an end. I just wish Hollywood would make some movies with a little imagination these days, for this one had NONE. At least the first one was entertaining.",The Mummy Returns
295,jstu9,"Bad, Really Bad",1,25 October 2001,"This was a bad movie. I thought ""The Haunting"" and ""Wild Wild West"" were bad but this was worse.It's another movie that just tries to make a movie with computer special effects without even trying to make any sense out of anything. This is a movie you must leave your brain at the door. Most of it is completely ridiculous and cliche filled.I wasn't expecting much but I thought I might be entertained for 2 hours. I thought the original did that for 2/3 of its length before turning ridiculous at the end. I'm not quite sure why I continued to watch this movie -- maybe its like looking at a car wreck on the side of the road.",The Mummy Returns
296,MovieTrey,A Fantastic Movie,7,4 July 2001,"The Mummy Returns is filled with action, comedy and is a wonderful movie. If you like action packed movies then go see The Mummy Returns. It proves once again that a sequel can be just as good, if not better than the original. This is probably Brendan Fraiser's best performance yet.  With wonderful performances from Brendan Frasier, Rachel Weiz, and John Hannah this is the first summer hit of 2001. The Mummy Returns starts off ten years after The Mummy (1999).  Rick O Connell (Frasier) is now married to Evelyn and they have a son.  They then uncover the long lost bracelet of the Scorpion King played by WWF's The Rock.  They then are joined up by Imotep and some other foes, and plan to destroy the Scorpion King and gain control of his army so he can rule the Earth.  In order to save their son and stop the mummy from controlling the Earth, they must stop Imotep and the Scorpion King themselves before the world becomes a formless wasteland. WWF fans maybe disappointed however.  The Rock, in his film debut is only in two scenes throughout the entire movie.  He truly outdoes himself plating the Scorpion King, a warrior who gives his soul to become the ultimate warrior.  Although it's a small role, The Rock gives a great performance as the Scorpion King.  All that time in the wrestling ring has really paid off for him in his new role as the Scorpion King. Although some sequels have been known to be bombs at the box office, this movie is a nonstop thrill ride.  It's filled with action, comedy, romance and everything else that makes a movie an instant favorite at the box office.  Only a few sequels however have measured up to the original.  This one is worth seeing again.  The whole cast gave an outstanding performance. From 1 to 10, I would have to give The Mummy Returns a 7.8, for its outstanding performances and the well thought out plot. Brendan Frasier and the rest of the group do a fantastic job in The Mummy Returns.  The summer of 2001 is nearly here and I suggest going to go see The Mummy Returns. If you like The Mummy Returns, then here are some recommendations for movies you should see.  First, you might wish to see The Mummy, so you may see for yourself how the original compares to the sequel.  Some other movies you might want to see if you enjoyed The Mummy Returns, would probably be the Indiana Jones Trilogy (The Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade).",The Mummy Returns
297,darkman-27,"Lots of fun, but a rushed sequal.",7,16 June 2001,"*Warning Possible Spoilers*The original Mummy is one of my favorite movies. So naturally nothing made my more excited when I heard of Mummy Returns. When It came out however, I can't help but feel a little let down. In my opinion, the first film was PERFECT in every way. Special Effects were carefully done, and a lot of time was spent. It just seemed like there was a perfect blend of Special Effects, Comedy, and Action.The Mummy Returns however Suffers from being a rushed project. They tried to do way to much, it to small of a time period. Mummy Returns has twice, maybe three/four times as many special effects shots as the Original film. Which is great and everything, but there just was not enough time to make them look perfect. And they were not nessary to make the film good. Don't get me wrong, I love special effects, but they just tried to do WAY TO MUCH. For example, the very end when you see the The Scorpion King... he just looks like crap. Why couldn't they just use the Rocks face?  Ill tell you why, because the movie was not finished yet! I heard that they were working on Special Effects shots for the movie up till a few weeks before it was released!So I guess what I am trying to say is I wish ""The Mummy Returns"" was more like ""The Mummy."" But I still enjoyed it. I am afraid of what the ""The Scorpion King"" (next Mummy film) is going to be like....The Mummy Returns gets a 7 out of 10 and The Original Mummy gets a 10 out of 10 from me.",The Mummy Returns
298,Tarantula,"IF ANYBODY OUT THERE UNDERRATED THIS FILM OR THINK IT'S POINTLESS OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES, THINK AGAIN!",10,12 May 2001,"I came into this movie expecting something really special, after all it did cost 130 Million dollars to make, it was the sequel to another favorite movie of mine, it was a year in the making, and my all time favorite wrestling legend THE ROCK was gonna play a cameo as the new and awesome ""HEEL"" THE SCORPION KING, something that was to really start The Most Electrifying Man In Sporting Entertainment's Movie Career (he is currently working on a movie entirely about his character, something that I will see as soon as possible!) It had a great opening with The Scorpion King and his unfortunate defeat in a Seven Year Long Battle, and then making a deal with a vicious Egyptian God! You watch the rest, I think I've told you enough because this a KICK-ASS movie from Start-Finish and was the most exciting movie that I'd ever seen in my entire goddamn life! Brilliant Performances by all, SIDE-SPLITTING Special Effects, Backed up by humour, sensational eye-popping beautiful landscapes and a great storyline! The action-adventure sequences are full throttle/non-stop, the intensity can really get to dangerous high-levels, the legend continues to amaze you and the final battle scene (or scenes because there are several fights going on at one time) are incredible! Even The Scorpion King's (or that vicious Egyptian God's) Army looks awesome as they engage in battle! THEY LOOKED INVINCIBLE AND BALLISTIC! This is somewhere in my top 3 movies, and I'm gonna grab it on video as soon as possible and I'll watch it again and again and again! I know that this isn't the sort of movie that would get into the top 250, but I would really like it to be. And to all those critics who think this movie is pointless, brainless, blah blah blah! Well, you're not exactly right at all because this is a blockbuster, a box-office smash, an AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME movie! 10/10 FROM ME! If there is any chance for this movie to ever get into the top 250 I would really hope that It can/does! In conclusion, THEY ARE ALL CHANTING THE ROCK'S NAME! (The Scorpion King!) ROCKY! ROCKY!

A rollercoaster ride from start to finish, and a brilliant cameo performance by the most electrifying man in sporting entertainment, the brahma bull, the great one, the people's champion and my favorite sporting entertainer; THE ROCK! Stunts galore, thrills, spills, action, adventure, deception, romance, and the list goes on. To all of those who mock this film for being pointless or anything else, SHUT THE F#CK UP BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST AND PROBABLY THE ONLY POPCORN MOVIE AROUND THAT DESERVES TO BE IN THE TOP 250! OK, so I may be going overboard there a little bit, but it's way better than any of Adam Sandler's sh!t! That'll be all about my favorite film, which deserves a supersonic 10!",The Mummy Returns
300,Brew_Swayne,Meh. Super Lazy Movie,3,26 April 2019,"The Mummy was pretty much everything you'd expect out of a light action/adventure movie, which was fun, exciting, with the right doses of humor and wit sprinkled throughout. Simply put - it worked.I don't exactly know what they were going for with The Mummy Returns, but I don't think there was really a ton of effort put into this movie at all, especially from a writing standpoint. I imagine one of the early production meetings went like this:
""Let's take the heroes and villains from the first movie and have them go at it again, but this time throw a kid in the mix. And near the end of the movie we can introduce a new villain* for about 3 minutes. Oh, and let's throw in a rocket powered hot air balloon just for the hell of it.""* = Is the Scorpion King actually a villain? Because in the stand alone Scorpion King movie, he was definitely the hero.To me, this movie felt like it was thrown together with little prep work and was really only done so that The Rock/Dwayne Johnson could get started on his movie career. I remember the pre-movie hype about him ""starring"" in it and then you watch it and find out it's basically just a CGI Rock near the end of the movie and he doesn't speak.The Mummy Returns doesn't really do much at all in terms of advancing character development of returning characters from the original and it doesn't tell a significantly new or different story. It might be one of the most pointless movies I've ever seen.",The Mummy Returns
301,emms75,Silly,1,25 April 2004,"The first film was fun. It wasn't necessarily the most original as far as narrative is concerned....and the acting wasn't anything more than ok....but it served its purpose as an entertaining adventure flick that I have watched a few times and still find enjoyable.The sequel however, was absolutely dreadful! The story was very poor. One of the main characters personalities had changed entirely, and I couldn't wait to see the credits roll. I was really disappointed having enjoyed the first film so much. I wish now I hadn't been sucked in by all the hype before it came out, then I might never have had to waste those precious hours of my life when I could have been doing something more useful like knitting a scarf for next winter or trimming my split ends. A word I feel is appropriate to describe The Mummy Returns is 'silly'. Very silly.",The Mummy Returns
302,Visitor_C,"A Decent Sequel, One That Sparks Another Franchise",7,30 May 2014,"So the real issue that I can find with this sequel comes from the story and the introduction of The Scorpion King. The story is a bit blander then the first film, but only within the first half. They even recycle the main villain of the first film into the second one. The acting is set back from the first one a bit, adding new side characters that don't add as much towards the story. My other issue that arose from this film is the introduction of the Scorpion King. Some how they made an entire different spin off from this character that was in the movie for only five minutes. This isn't the worst thing that this film could have done, it just pisses me off. It is not bad, by any means. I guess I am just getting nit picky and stuff.",The Mummy Returns
303,Loothor,Computerized Nincompoopery,4,10 May 2001,"When did the advances made in special effects technology erase the need for a coherent plot and interesting characters in modern film? Can't a huge budget production like this find money for at least one decent script writer? Is it really that hard to write a decent screenplay?This movie is entertaining only for it's special effects, and somehow manages to be even more muddled, cliched, and trite than the first one. 10 years from now this film will be about as memorable as ""Starship Troopers"". This is tailor-made for people who thought ""The Patriot"" was a good historical drama.",The Mummy Returns
304,#1 Gracie,Returning With Better Effects But Mediocre Story,7,11 May 2001,"I just ""returned"" (ha ha) from the movies this evening from seeing ""The Mummy Returns"". And while I loved it, I was also a bit disappointed.The story begins with a narrator explaining the legend of the Scorpion King (The Rock), and in turn begins with a magnificent battle scene. After the legend, we are taken to the current time where Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are touring the tomb in which Evie finds the mystical bracelet of the Scorpion King. However, a group of bad guys and a reincarnated version of Im-Ho-Tep's (Arnold Vosloo) mistress Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Valezquaz) are also after that very bracelet to use in their plot to bring back Im-Ho-Tep, raise the Scorpion King's powerful armies from the dead, and take over the world (bwa ha ha!-kidding). They succeed in stealing the safe in which the bracelet was kept, but are foiled when they discover the bracelet isn't there, on account of it being on the wrist of Evie and Rick's kid, Alex (Freddie Boath). So they steal the kid, leading Rick and Evie into another wild adventure dealing with ancient curses and evil mummies in order to save both their son and the world from destruction.This movie was spell bounding cinematically. Beautiful and breath-taking special effects in almost all of the scenes! You saw some of The Matrix effects used in some of the fight scenes. And the sound effects have certainly improved from the last film. It was amazing to watch.But it stumbled upon one problem, and that problem can be best explained by one of my mottos for movies: a movie can't live on special effects alone. Between the action/fight sequences...well, the story was weak. It never really interested or impressed me whenever there was no effects. Now, I'm not one of those people that need lots of awesome effects to keep me entertained. It's just that the screenplay/story needed more work when it couldn't rely on movie magic to help it survive.The acting was okay. I thought Rachel Weisz was somewhat weak in her performance. Brendan Fraser did an alright job, as did pretty much all of the actors. The one I really liked though was whoever played Izzy, Rick's assistant. Any no-effects scene he was in was instantly wonderful. He deserved a bigger role, and I think they should make a movie out of Rick and Izzy's pre-Mummy adventures. I'd pay to see that!Overall, the movie was fun summer entertainment. While weak in some areas, I thought it was very fun to watch and a good way to spend a Friday night in the summer. I give it a 7/10",The Mummy Returns
305,Michael Laing,The worst movie since Hanibal,3,23 May 2001,"Oh boy, what a turkey.  This is a terrible film, Stephen Summers should be ashamed of himself, for putting together such a bad film.  The idea for the film is interesting but unfortunately, due to some terrible writing and uninspired direction, the film just goes from one fight scene to the next, with little development of the plot or characters in between. The some of the set look extremely good, while others look tacky and cheap. The CGI varies from jaw droppingly good to awfully computery, proving that because something can be done, it does not mean that it should be.  The acting is wooden, with none of the character being particulary interesting. The could have something to do with the terrible dialogue which could have come from a bad fifties B movie.  Again, we see another annoying kid, who is given far to much screen time.  When will Hollywood learn that kids and films don't mix.  The only good thing about the film really is the fight scenes, which are extremely well put together and exciting.  Overall the film is a huge let down,I went, wanting to enjoy it but left feeling disappointed. lets hope that Tomb Raider is better when it is released this summer.",The Mummy Returns
306,coasterrd,you bet your @ss im getting this on dvd,10,21 May 2001,"action! action! action! alot of it so much action by the time the movie is over you will forget what just happened. Perfect for action fans I just wish Benny was in this one. I mean why not, characters who died in the first were in here. otherwise this movie was great just tell grandma to bring here earplugs!",The Mummy Returns
307,Alex Klotz,"Some impressive special effects, but a very superficial movie.",3,10 November 2001,"Whereas ""The Mummy"" was a likeable approach to popcorn cinema, the sequel lacks of any sort of characterization. There are some impressive Effects, like the flashbacks to ancient Egypt or the animated pygmies borrowed from ""Jason and the Argonauts"", but the plot and the characters are simplified in a way that they should offend any viewer that exceeds the age of ten years. Although the script offers chances of ambiguity, it destroys them immediately by a childish black and white philosophy. Regarding its costs, some of the effects aren't very convincing - like the scorpion king, who looks like a character from a video game - Ray Harryhausen made stuff like that more chilling forty years ago. Although ""The Mummy"" didn't reach its predecessors directed by Karl Freund and Terence Fisher, i though it was kinda fun. But the sequel is a sad example of producers smothering the audience with special effects so that they won't recognize the actual stupidity of the picture.",The Mummy Returns
308,paulmg,"A worthy, enjoyable ride.",6,4 May 2001,"I liked the new direction they took Evie, making her more like aCameron woman: tough. Very different from how she began in thefirst film, but it still works. I like strong women in film. I hate the""Help me, James,"" you so often get in Bond movies. So seeingRachel come out as this tough broad willing to risk her neck andnot afraid to get down and dirty with the boys in order to save herfamily was very cool. Rick's a bit older, and more cautious. He's got a family now anddoesn't want anything to happen to them. His best moments arewhen Evie or his son, Alex, are in danger. Speaking of Alex, the kid (Freddie Boath, I think) who plays him isreally good. A fine addition to the cast. The rest of the returning cast is fine as well, especially Oded. Hegets beat up pretty good, but he's got some great scenes.Acting-wise, the film is strong. It's the effects that really mar the film. You can tell the movie wasrushed into theaters, unfortunately. They really should havepushed this back till November. The old Mummy effects andassorted returning tricks from the original look fine, but a greatmany of the new stuff looks bad. The hot air balloon, in particular,looks fake in almost every shot. And the final CG for the ScorpionKing, not too give too much away, is almost laughable. It reallylooks silly. I've heard complaints that Anubis's dog warriors lookedfake, but hey, they're dog warriors - how real did you expect them tolook? They're fine. They get the job done. There's also much less humor this time. The film is darker. Thegross factor has been pushed up a bit. What humor there isdepends a great deal on having seen the first film. What works, though, are the personal relationships of thecharacters. I really bought into Rick and Evie's relationship, andthat these people care for each other, and were willing to die forone another. There is a very interesting juxtaposition of theirrelationship and the one between Imhotep and Anck-Su-Anum,culminating in a final moment for all four. The way each reacts totheir corresponding counterpart in that one moment is the realresolution of the film, despite anything else that may occur after it.
As for the action, everything has been turned up a notch. While thefirst had a fairly long passage in the middle with only one shortaction sequence (on the boat), this film races from one actionsequence to another. It never really stops to take its breath. Somemay say this is a bad thing, but it never loses sight of the principalcharacters along the way, and the action is strong. The threat is also more real this time, culminating in the death ofone of the returning leads, rather than a side character like Benifrom the first film. It's a shock that works for its immediacy andpotency. Like its predecessor, the film is driven not by the men, but bywomen (and, in this case, children). It is Evie and Anck-Su-Anumwho propel the story forward, along with young Alex, and who forcethings to their eventual conclusion. Even The Mummy himselfalmost takes a back seat on the ride, as the O'Connells are forcedto deal with myriad bad guys. But he pops up every once in a whileto muss their hair and make up. To see an action film driven not bymen but by women is a rarity, and even more rare is one thatworks for a male audience. But this one does. All in all, the film is a fine sequel. I missed the humor of theoriginal, and the effects should have been given more time, but theaction is good, and the characterization is strong. This isn't just aremake of the original. They took the story in a new direction andturned things up a notch. The core of the film is the O'Connellfamily. If you buy into them and their relationship, and care for themas they care for one another, then you'll live with the occasionalawful CG and won't bemoan the lack of humor too much. If not,then it's going to be a very long film.",The Mummy Returns
309,dis-6,Nearly but nearly,7,18 May 2001,"This is much more of an action film than the 1999 ""The Mummy"" and it so nearly matches or beats that film...but it doesn't for me.
What are great are the battles, the interplay between Jonathan and Alex, the scenery both real and CGI, the British Museum resurrection of Imhotep, the O'Connells, Izzy, Ardeth Bay, the balloon, the Rock in battle, Imhotep's rejection by Anck-su-Amun and the general whoosh of action whose pace never lets up.There are lots of good touches like all the mummies in the British Museum coming to life at the same time or Izzy filling in some of O'Connell's past misdeeds and a few cheesy cliches like the dirigible floating across a huge moon a la E.T.What let it down were the lack of a real narrative once the bracelet was off, the Rock looked in perfect health when supposedly close to death in the desert, the awful CGI of the Scorpion King ( whoever thought that was close to flesh colour needs a new colour chart ) and those terrible pygmy mummies at the oasis where the fight just went on and on and on.It was fun but it could have been greater :-) and I don't think the Rock can carry the third film on his own :-(",The Mummy Returns

I saw it in the first movie and was not impressed then, why should I be impressed with it being used TWICE the second time around?Honestly, the first movie was so forgettable, I don't even remember how they defeated Imhotep at the end. I tried, but couldn't recall. But that may have been a good thing. Since I had put the monstrosity of a film called 'The Mummy' behind me last summer, I was able to enjoy this sequel as a stand-alone story in its own right. In that regard, I admit I was mildly entertained.Unfortunately, most of the ""entertainment"" value came from predicting the plot ""twists"" and noting where certain scenes and characters were stolen from. I said out loud ""But she'll make point five past light speed!"" when the pilot says ""She may not look like much...""And where was that tattoo on Brendan Fraser's arm in the first movie? And the weapons used in the 'cat fight' scenes between Nefertiri and Anuk-sun-whatever are oriental weapons...not Egyptian.

311,Primate84,Pretty good,7,5 May 2001,"I just saw ""The Mummy Returns"" a few hours ago, and was pleasantly surprised with it. I actually consider it to be a little bit better than its predecessor. The graphics and creature effects were really good, with the exception of those used during the fight scene between Rick O'Connell and the Scorpion King. I particularly liked the funny pygmy monsters and the scary Anubis warriors. Freddie Boath was really good as the O'Connells' son Alex, and made me laugh in several scenes. Another character that I liked was Ardeth Bay, the mysterious nomad leader first seen in the original film (They should make a spinoff movie about him instead of one about the Scorpion King). I kind of liked the humorous hidden references that were made to the first film(Such as the scene in the first one when Jonathan has difficulty deciphering a certain hyroglyphic during a crucial moment). It was also pretty cool to finally see Evelyn really fighting in a few scenes.This movie was more exciting than the first one, and for the most part, more fun in general.",The Mummy Returns
312,bhat962,An outstanding sequel to a forgotten film,9,13 May 2001,"'The Mummy'- a hit film in 1999, definitely needed a sequel to actually show meaning of the movie. It did and the sequel was fantastic. The Rock's potrayal of the Scorpion King was great and other characters as Imothep returned to brighten the Egyptian sky and paint it yellow once again. The story is intelligently stylish and the movie is as more campier and funnier as the first. More action, more plot, and definitely more meaning. A great and wonderful movie. If I was Hollywood or Director Sommers- I would add a third installment.One word- Wow!Out of four stars- I give it a four (reason is because most sequels always stink, but this one amazingly didn't after all the anticipating flames).Shout goes out to Fraser for a great job and Rachael Weiz (who turns out to be more beautiful than anybody had ever imagined).",The Mummy Returns
313,pv71989-1,A lot of fun and a lot of errors,5,20 September 2007,"I would have rated it hire if the producers hadn't tried to cram so much action down our throats. ""The Mummy Returns"" picks up seven years after the first film. Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are married and have a precocious (and stereotypical) son named Alex (Freddie Boath).Unfortunately, their peace is about to be shattered. Anck Su Namun (the incredibly gorgeous Patricia Velasquez) has been reincarnated. She has teamed up with a museum curator (Alun Armstrong) and his cult, led by Lock-Nah (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who should get an award just for hanging onto such an difficult name in Hollywood circles). Together, they excavate the ruins of Hamunaptra and unearth Imhotep. Later, they will revive him in London, try to revive the Bracelet of Anubis, kidnap Evie, sic mummies on Rick, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), kidnap Alex and lead our heroes on a dangerous search for the Oasis of Ahm Shere, where Imhotep hopes to defeat the fabled Scorpion King (played mostly in CG by The Rock) and take control of the Army of Anubis.Whew, that's a mouthful. The film has great action. A big fight scene in Rick's house, both upstairs and downstairs. A shoot-out in a museum. An exciting bus chase through the streets of London. A race between a tidal wave and a dirigible. An attack by strange-looking (and, ultimately, annoying) pygmy skeletons. A showdown between Imhotep and Rick, Jonathan and Anck Su Namun and then Evie and Anck Su Namun.Definitely worth the price of admission.However, the film had too many errors to warrant more than a five. Let's face it. Most movies had continuity errors (even ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") but this film goes way beyond normal. It's almost like no research was done for this film and the director just went for what he thought the world of 1933 would look like.For example: 1) There's a woman-on-woman fight scene in ancient Egypt before Pharoah Seti I, featuring sai blades. Sai blades were not in Egypt, but were created in China during the Ming Dynasty, which did not come about until 1368.2) Alex's slingshot wasn't made until 1954.3) Jonathan breaks off a key in the ignition of Rick's limousine, yet ignition keys for cars didn't come around until 1949.4) The double-decker bus Jonathan commandeers in London was not designed until 1954.5) Izzy (Shaun Parks), pilot of the dirigible that takes Rick and Evie to Ahm Shere, uses a fire extinguisher that seems old but wasn't made until 1980.6) Alex is supposed to be eight years old. The Three Stooges -- actually three schmucks (Bruce Byron, Joe Dixon, Tom Fisher) written in only to be cannon fodder for Imhotep's assimilation -- comment that the Black Book of the Dead meant death for the Yanks of the original film nine years earlier. Much of the original film was set in 1926, a mere 7(!!!) years earlier. Somehow, the script writers fixated on 1923, the year in which the original movie was begun (remember, after Rick's escape from Hamunaptra, the film advanced three years to 1926).7) There are a few other major hits, but none worse than (possible spoiler) a massive fight between the 12 Tribes of the Medjai and Anubis' warrior army. The 12 tribes seem to have 10,000 men on horseback. After the first round of battle, they're whittled down to several hundred, but we see not one body -- of Medjai or horse nor will we. If the film was trying to capture the magnificence of ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" or even ""Spartacus,"" it failed horribly.But, perhaps the most egregious problem is how the sequel screws up the events of the original film. In ""The Mummy Returns,"" Evie is presented as the physical and spiritual reincarnation of Nefertiri, daughter of Seti I. In the first film, however, Imhotep mistakes Evie for a reincarnation of Anck Su Namun. How could he have not recognized Nefertiri? In ""TMR,"" he doesn't seem to recognize her as Nefertiri either. In fact, Anck Su Namun doesn't recognize Evie as Nefertiri until almost the end of the film. What gives?Also, at the end of the first film, when Imhotep sinks into the Well of Souls, he loses all the life he ripped from the Americans and the Egyptologist. We see his eyes and tongue go last. In ""TMR,"" he reawakens with eyes and a tongue.Oh, well, maybe I'm being too harsh. Brendan Fraser was his usual cool self and Arnold Vosloo almost stole the show again. The Rock was not in the film enough (but was in ""The Scorpion King"" way too much). The fight scene between Rick and Imhotep was fantastic with its array of weapons. It was also nice to see Jonathan stop being a cowardly wuss and Alex did tone down the annoying ""mischievous kid"" act by the end of the film. Anck Su Namun was particular seductive and evil (see her first meeting with Alex), although I had a hard time believing how her (oops, spoiler potential)...demise was presented. It seemed suddenly out of character and forced. So, just go with the flow on this on. Watch it for the action and try not to be too cerebral. For action flicks, thinking too much can hurt.",The Mummy Returns

The movie is a fun action film that is completely aware that it is nothing more than a fun action film.  So what if the laws of physics do not apply.  So what if the acting is melodramatic, the dialogue is cheesy, and the characters in this movie world seem aware of it.  That is the point.  The ""Mummy"" movies are to action movies as the first ""Scream"" movie was to horror, just without a character thrown in to tell you every time that the movie is being a parody/stereotype.

317,Nedla24,lighten up!!!,8,5 May 2001,"I have been reading the abysmal reviews this movie is getting with amazement.  Since when did swashbuckling fun have to be high art?  I am convinced that Stephen Somers did something evil in a past life to deserve such a poor reception.  The original received a similar critical response which is what kept me from it.  Then when I viewed it recentley, I wondered if I had seen the same movie these critics had thrashed.  Luckily the public didn't buy it, and it doesn't look like they're scared away this time.  I thought for the moviegoer that might be a bit scared, I would like do address some of the critics complaints1. The plot is too convoluted: This is not a particularly hard plot to follow, though it has many twists.  while it is not a masterful work of logic that keeps you guessing, it gives the movie many venues for it's great action sequences.  The back story of the Mummy is actually quite sad and touching, and if you are willing to just let it wash over you and not over-analyze, then you will find it quite enjoyable.2. It rips off from nearly every movie ever made: This has a bit more merit, but still is misunderstood.  The movie makes many homages to adventure movies including Braveheart, The Lost World, Gladiator, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and all of the Indiana Jones movies.  The large battle sequences echo Braveheart when two charging armies collide in a crunching of steel, wood, and flesh.  But come on Mel, what did you expect?  That shot is waaaay too cool to be in just one movie.  The Crouching Tiger references are the new pet Falcon of Oded Fehr's character, and the multi-weapon girlfights between Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez.  These are subtle at best. There is one scene which almost criminally rips off the tall grass raptor scene in the Lost World.  however it improves upon it.  Unlike the lost world, there are two opposing groups walking through the tall grass with the hidden nasties in it, trying to find each other, one character is trying to find another that has been taken captive, two adversaries are sword deuling, and two snipers are trying to help their friends.... you get the idea.  it improves upon the scene by adding elements and handling it well.3. it is mindless: it is not.  it is actually quite intelligent as is the original.  it takes time to poke fun at itself.  it never loses the sense that the audience KNOWS that none of this could happen and is able to appeal to that sense.  4. Brendan Fraser is not an action hero - I couldn't disagree more.  Action hero's don't have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone to be believable.  Fraser channels a mix between two of the best action heroes around; Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis.  He has Ford's sense of dignity and believable heroism mixed with Willis's dry sense of humor.  Also I guarantee you that Brendan Fraser is in much better physical shape than either of the two ever were.  so there it is.  It's a great popcorn popper, and no matter what the critics say, I can almost guarantee you will leave the theatre with a smile on your face.",The Mummy Returns
318,discoroux,SPECTACULAR!,10,20 May 2001,"This movie was simply spectacular! It totally blew its predecessor away! It was packed with suspenseful action. The sound effects & art direction were great. I also liked the dissolves between scenes. It had some humor so it's not utterly dull, but not too much to make it weak like the first Mummy film did. The plot was very suspensful. The visual effects were pretty good too, although I have seen better. There was one thing that was disappointing. It would've been nice for the Scorpion King to have a bigger part.In conclusion, if you're a lover of action & adventure, This is the film for you. Have a nice day!",The Mummy Returns
319,imdbmykl,An enjoyable ride on the coat-tails of the first,7,13 May 2001,"I didn't really know what to expect from The Mummy Returns. On one hand, it had the potential to be a work of art, taking what was built from the original movie and adding to it. On the other hand, it could be another tired rehash of the same film. In the end it was a bit of both.The film certainly looks very nice. The special effects (with the exception of the Scorpion King) are superb and really convey a sense of power. Imhotep and his effects are handled very nicely.There is very little, if any, character development in the film. That said, a lot of background information left out of the original is provided and some questions about the first film are answered. This is a lot of fun for those who like tie-ins to other films. However, a lot of the jokes used in the original are reused here (homage, or rehash?)The plot premise is believable and the scriptwriters did a good job of providing everyone with a reason to be in the film. Plot inconsistencies are rare. I've seen a lot worse lately (e.g. Red Planet).If you're an action fan, look no further. This film is non-stop. In fact, there's almost too much of it. We don't get the chance to stop and take a breather for much of the film. Unfortunately, that means that the journey is largely glossed over in favour of hacking and slaying (not that that's a bad thing).Overall I felt that it was a good film, provided that you've seen the original. Those seeing this alone will probably not get as much out of it. 7/10",The Mummy Returns
320,firedude440,coolest movie of the summer,9,22 June 2001,"if there is only one movie to see this summer, the mummy returns should be the one. like every year cheesy movies always come out in the summer and this is in a way (same kind of stuff as the first one) but funny cheesy. good cheesy. and this one is ten times better than the first one. way more humor. go see this movie, trust me you wont be disappointed",The Mummy Returns
321,ACMcC24,One of the few times I enjoyed the sequel just as much as the original.,9,31 January 2004,"If there is one thing that a sequel is always able to promise (in Hollywood at least), is more action and a more complex plot.  I won't go into what it's about since if you're reading the comments then you must already have some idea as to the plot.  To sum up the point of the story, there isn't really one.  This movie was meant to reunite an excellent cast and to have fun.  You can tell this from many of the parallels between the original and the 2nd.  So, if you go into this movie with about the same amount of seriousness as the first, then you will have fun.  As for the SFX, it is also about the same.  Not meant to be completely realistic bordering on comic book style.  The majority of it fit the style of the movie perfectly which is good, since if the SFX were any more realistic, then it would force you to look at the movie more seriously than you should. The exception to this was that the Scorpion King was a little less impressive than what he could have or should have been.In terms of fun, it deserves a 9.  In terms of SFX, it deserves a 7.5.  So I gave it an 8, though I may change and give it a 9.",The Mummy Returns
322,CptPtnia,Not Sure If I Liked It,6,5 May 2001,"OK, as an action film, it was enjoyable.  Yes it suffers from ""Sequel-itis"". It was fun to watch.  Enjoyable characters, great effects (most of the time-Scorpion King was poorly done).   My big problem with the movie was the ""bad guys"".  The film-makers decided to go with excess.  In other words, there were a lot of different bad guys, each with their own agenda.  Of course, this made the task our heros face very daunting.  They were successful in this.  However, if you look at each of the characters one by one, and you consider that each one is supposed to be the epitome of all evil, each was far too easily vanquished.  Imhotep, the title character, himself turns into a cowardly, sniveling weasel, therefore making him one of the least significant of the baddies! 
Plot holes galore, but that is to be expected in any film of this type. Just a celebration of excess that could have been done better with some restraint.  Still enjoyable to watch, but try not to think of it as a great movie, and you will be better off.  Give it a try.",The Mummy Returns
323,MobiusAg,Non-Stop Action with the Ancient,8,9 May 2001,After all the hoopla surrounding The Mummy Returns I had to go and see it. The original Mummy was a pleasant surprise and the sequel looked promising. I must say that I was entertained throughout the movie but there were some problems with it as well. I was not impressed with the matte paintings used for the backdrops as they were obvious and not well done. The special effects as well lacked quality and at times I could not believe this motion picture was a result of 21st Century movie making. All in all I think Universal rushed to get this picture made and it seems cut corners to get it out to theatres. Even with these problems I enjoyed the film. Some of the script was rather corny but again I think it is expected. I also did not really like the actor cast as the son. All in all though it was an entertaining film and at times the scenery was breath taking. The movie contains all sorts of action and thrill sequences. Approach the film with an open mind and prepare to expect an entertaining two hours of Mummy mayhem.,The Mummy Returns
324,TimeTrvlr03,"Entertaining, but could have been better",7,2 July 2001,"This movie was completely devoid of any unique plotline, but that doesn't diminish the entertainment value.  If you come into this movie expecting some profound meaning, you will be vastly disappointed by this rehashing of the same plot line that worked for Indiana Jones.  Because that is really all it is.  A little fighting, a little running, a little humor, shake it, don't stir it and you have this film.  But, if you have no expectations (I hadn't even ever seen the first one, though I hear this one was better, which makes me not want to see the first one), than you can just sit back and enjoy the scenery.  This movie was filmed in some beautiful locations (Egypt, London, Morocco, Petra, etc).  And Brendan Fraser and Oded Fehr are hunks.  And the humor kept the audience twittering, even if the delivery was a bit dry and contrived.  Perhaps the worst element of this movie was some of the digital effects. The animation of the Scorpion King at the end was pathetic.  There is better animation in Pac Man.  The least they could have done was actually use The Rock rather than trying to recreate him digitally.  And enough already with the Matrix effects.  We've seen enough slow motion kicks and punches to last a lifetime.  It's time to put that technique on the shelf and give it a rest.All in all, this movie won't be a classic, but its entertaining enough (score: 6.5 out of 10).",The Mummy Returns
325,notdempsey,Maintains the fun of its predecessor at the expense of any dignity the franchise had left.,2,26 December 2004,"Early in ""The Mummy Returns,"" sequel to Universal's 1999 blockbuster remake ""The Mummy,"" charming American swashbuckler Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) fights a cadre of decomposed Egyptian corpses on the back of a London double-decker. Also on the bus is Rick's wife/scholar Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), to whom he laments, ""This is bad!"" ""We've had bad before,"" Evelyn replies. Rick: ""This is worse!"" Indeed! As is the whole of ""The Mummy Returns,"" a film so ludicrously over the top and blindly made that even after Warner Brothers' dismal ""Wild Wild West"" featuring jets retrofitted to a flying bicycle, this film put the jets on a flying boat.Explaining the plot of ""The Mummy Returns"" in detail is about as necessary as cooking directions on Pop-Tarts: Ten-or-so years after the events in ""The Mummy,"" Rick and Evelyn must search the globe for their son Alex (Freddie Boath) who, after trying on a bracelet that was actually an ancient artifact belonging to a Babylonian-era warlord named The Scorpion King (The Rock), becomes a human map to a mythical oasis where The King awaits an opponent who, if victorious, will take control of his armies and have the power to rule the world. The kidnapper was none other than Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the eponymous ghoul and former high priest thwarted by O'Connell in the first film, now resurrected by the voluptuous Meela Nais (Patricia Valasquez), reincarnation of Anck Su Namun, the ancient beauty whom Imhotep shared a fatal affair with thousands of years ago. The evil pair plan to find the oasis and defeat The Scorpion King, and thus, like a biblical Bonnie and Clyde, set the whole gory story into motion.And those are just the broad strokes! Along the way we encounter the usual hoards of faceless, black-cloaked baddies with guns, the not-so-usual undead soldiers, and the flat-out weird and nasty little pygmy-mummies--everything coated with the oh-so-easy-to-swallow zombie in-jokes of ghouls bobbling their own decapitated heads.All that said, ""The Mummy Returns"" maintains all the fun of its predecessor (if only at the expense of any dignity the franchise had left.) This is a movie that knows it's bad (and boy is it bad!), that knows it's the ultimate product of the Hollywood machine--and is damn proud of it! It's undeniably great to see O'Connell leap and tumble his way out of ridiculously overwhelming odds--literally one wrong step from being horribly gored in front of his child. At the film's climax, O'Connell is engaged in a battle against the new and CGI improved Scorpion King (complete with giant scorpion legs and torso). As I watched Brendan Fraser (and/or his stuntman) dodge the unstoppable claws of the rendered-Rock's intimidating mandible, it occurred to me that I hadn't seen such wickedly intense choreography of actor and CGI since Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore tangoed beautifully with a pair of hungry velociraptors in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" (another enjoyable franchise-destroyer). For ""The Mummy Returns,"" VFX supervisor John Andrew Burton Jr. and a very extended team brought this sequence to life.Fraser has always plunged headfirst into roles that even the most work-starved actor might shy away from (""Encino Man,"" ""Looney Toons: Back In Action,"" ""Monkeybone""), and does so with such enthusiasm that we never feel embarrassed for him. Here he embraces Rick O'Connell in all his two-dimensionality where others might abandon the role, and the character survives because of him.Joining Rick and Evelyn are Evelyn's unscrupulous-yet-lovable bro Jonathan (John Hannah) and the melodramatic guru-warrior Ardeth Bey (that dude with all the Arabic writing on his cheeks, played by Oded Fehr), who also serves as the film's interim historian, giving us any and all back story needed without all the bother of exposition or creative storytelling. An enjoyable chemistry and timing has developed between these actors in just two films. There truly is a sense of camaraderie; We find it quite easy, for example, to accept Jonathan's momentary turn of seriousness toward the end of the film after two acts of comedy because the other actors know just how to respond to him (Hannah is possibly the best Scottish actor alive, see ""Sliding Doors"").Of course, the bulk of the film is lighthearted, and any melodrama is taken with a grain of salt--not least of all by screenwriter/director Sthephen Sommers, who plays up the group-fun-breeziness that worked so well with the first mummy movie; Upon seeing the forbidden bracelet on Alex's arm, Ardeth decrees grimly, ""By putting on the bracelet, you have started a chain reaction that could bring about the next apocalypse."" Fraser looks at Ardeth, ""Hey, you, lighten up."" I suppose that's Sommers' best and only defense against critics like Peter Travers of Rolling Stone who (justifiably) called his film ""A p!ss poor mummy movie indeed that doesn't deliver a damn thing worth preserving.""""Hey, Peter, lighten up.""",The Mummy Returns
326,applejosh1991,"a fun sequel, but the lackluster script hurts it's full potential",6,23 April 2020,"First of all, this sequel for a period of time was very popular when it was released in spring 2001, being a box-office hit, spawned a couple of video games (there not that good), an animated series that lasted 2 seasons (suitable for children, no flesh eating bugs or PG-13 graphic violence) and started the movie career of wrestler-turned actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, and of course the prequel film ""The Scorpion King"" starring The Rock. this film was constantly on television for a long time, even more then the 1999 Mummy film. i saw this film when i was 11, i loved it back then, however one of the secondary villain's death scene gave me the heebie-jeebies and nightmares for years. i was only 11, i easily get nightmares at the time. now re-watching after a very long time, finally overcome this once disturbing death scene. still enjoy the film, but the flaws are much bigger then i remember.almost the entire original cast and production crew are back, with Stephen Sommers returning to write and direct this film, but this time it feels like more of a studio demand film then a well-balanced sequel.the plot takes place 9 years after the events of the first film, Rick and Evy are married and have an 8 year-old son named Alex, they became rich (probably from remaining treasures they found in the previous film, since they never bothered to even reference it), live in a big manner somewhere in Britain. but their adventure tomb-seeking habits never left them and all three O'Connell's went exploring ancient egyptian ruins, thanks to evy's visions they manged find the ""bracelet of Anubis"" as a valuable treasure at first, unaware it's a cursed item that can guide to the resting place of The Scorpion King and also a key to unleash god of the underworld Anubis' Jackal army. meanwhile evil worshiping cult leaded by Meela Nais a reincarnation of Imhotep's lover Anck Su namon who's being having similar visions to evy about her past and found Imhotep's corpse in the ruins of Hamunaptra. resurrecting him with the ""Book of the Dead"" to fulfill some kind of ancient prophecy on the year of the scorpion (on the year the film takes place) to kill the scorpion king and control his army for world domination. after the baddies failed to achieve the bracelet, they kidnapped Alex (due to his curiosity to put the bracelet on his wrist, unable to remove it) to use him to guide them to the secret resting place until they see fit to dispose him. Rick and Evy on their pursuit to find him with the help of Medjai Ardeth Bay, Evy's Brother Johnathan Carnahan and the pilot Izzy Buttons, to find their son and stop Imhotep from fulfilling his destiny.like with the previous film, the sequel ""the mummy returns"" has great production values, time period setting, much larger action set-pieces and in times it does feel bigger in scope, the cinematography, fight choreography, stunt work, nailed the action, sense of adventure, ancient Egypt themes with egyptian mythology, culture and trying their best to add the dead language of ancient Egypt into the film the second time. some special effects looks fine other's very outdated (even back in 2001).the protagonists: Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell is more developed this time, less of a jerk and more serious, cares about his family more likable then before, but the one who has changed the most was Rachel Weisz character Evy, from a book-worm to ass-kicking adventurer, she can hold her own, to the point that rick is almost a secondary character to her. their son Alex played by freddie boath who manged to avoid the annoying child character trope in this film, he's funny and likable, very smart 8 year old and comes off like a secondary comic relief, similar to John Hannah's character Johnathan Carnahan, who changed very little, but still funny and has few great moments. Oded Fehr as ardeth bay is fine, but sadly very underdeveloped when compare to the first film and his dialogue is 90% exposition dump. the villains: Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep is great as always, but sadly little underdeveloped, since Patricia Velásquez character Meela has more focus as villain then him. both Alun Armstrong and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje characters ""Hafez"" and ""Lock-Nah"" are excellent side villains, it's a shame they barley have any development.
and of course Dwayne Johnson as the other main villain The Scorpion King, who only appears twice, first in the prologue and in the final climax with infamously badly rendered motion capture CGI.the late Jerry goldsmith was replaced with Alan Silvestri, who i think did an great job less majestic and more sense of high epic adventure music, considering the film is going for much bigger Indiana Jones vibe then the previous film. but lacks the sense of mystery and wonders that goldsmith provided.so what's the problems? the script and some of the CGI. unlike the first film which had better pacing, focus and a point, the sequel's plot feels genuinely rushed, underdeveloped and moves from point A to Point B very quickly. the film has more going for the emotions and visual storytelling to it, but the dots don't really connect and it comes at the price of underdeveloped characters, motivations that makes zero sense and a lot of mythology and geography errors. they don't even bother to explain important plot details like who are the evil worshiping cult is or why imhotep doesn't want to take his revenge on the O'Connell's. there are couple of plot holes as well, but the one that bothered me even back then was on Evy and Meela being the reincarnations of their egyptian ancestors (that connect's to the fate of imhotep, when the pharaoh was killed) which causes their visions is very head-scratching and comes off as forced lazy storytelling to piece an already under-cooked script, it's such a shame because underneath this lazy script there's a very fun epic adventure film that could have been even better then the first film if they took their time working on a better script (since sommers wrote it). the CGI, for some reason sommers used this tool a lot since his film ""Deep Rising"", with the effect from ILM, but due to it's early age it can look super ugly on some things. CGI on imhotep is an improvement from the first film, some green screens look really good while others look very dated, but the scorpion king from the distance looks fine, thanks to clever lighting and other effects but from close-up it's really bad gives a very early 2000 video game CGI cut-scene vibe.also i must address this, not only the script feels lazy and rushed but there's also blatant copying plot-points from the first film here, another opening prologue that takes place 3,000 or 5,000 years ago to introduce a villain who later get resurrected, some macguffin item that's both a key and a map, using flight transportation to the destination to rescue someone, imhotep using one of the elements with his face on it to stop protagonists flight transportation, another secret ancient temple in the middle of the desert that many people were looking for they never found it or never returned, a gold item/weapon to stop the main villain, imhotep loses his powers by the third-act and dies by giving himself to the underworld, the secondary villain gets killed by insects and ends with the protagonists escaping just in time from a collapsing temple with treasure in the end.despite this issues, it's still enjoyable popcorn flick, just switch-off you're brain because the amount of plot-holes and suspension of disbelief is much higher then the first film.",The Mummy Returns

What can I say about the action?  It is fabulous from start to finish - especially the scenes in London, featuring Tower Bridge and the British Museum as you've never seen them before!  The little mummies are superb as they scuttle along buildings, and there are also some thrilling chase sequences through the forests!All acting is first-rate in this film - Brendan Fraser I find just the most likeable hero, Rachel Weisz looks even more stunning, Patricia Velasquez is perfectly bitchy, John Hannah is again the typical English clown, and Arnold Vosloo adds another dimension to the character of Imhotep - I even felt sorry for the guy in this film!  And how could I forget Freddie Boath, who does an excellent job as an amusing though stereotypical boy-scout-type kid. Also look out for a scene-stealing turn from the airship-pilot, but the star of the show just has to be Horus, the kestrel!The special effects perhaps vary in this film, from breathtakingly-brilliant to downright pathetic.  I particularly found the scenes in the airship, flying through the sky, very dodgy - surely that's a cardboard cut-out in the background?!But did I mention the music?  This film has a fantastic soundtrack, which I made sure to buy, and adds even more merit to a remarkable adventure.Overall, I'd give this film at least 7/10 for pure entertainment value - it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it rivals the likes of 'Star Wars' as the best popcorn movie ever!",The Mummy Returns

She is absolutely stunning in this film and shows she has a very strong film ""presence"" unlike any other actress I have ever seen except for Marilyn Monroe. Despite other weak characters, her character comes alive with magnetic film persona and draws in the audience from the weak plot which the movie is based upon.

332,To'kun,a movie with mythical allusions,10,10 May 2001,"*vague mild spoiler warning*First, I must say this movie is not so much a sequel but a*continuation* of the first movie, even though it takes place 8 yearslater.  Alone, Mummy Returns does not work; it requires the moviegoer to know the first film well before seeing it. As for the film itself, it uses some interesting story tellingtechniques that further defines Evie's and Rick's character; theyhave mythical origins.  That is what makes this movie great.  Evieis an important reincarnated Egyptian character from the past andRick is the hero who discovers himself (he realizes his originsnear the movie's end) -- this is stuff Joseph Campbell would talkabout.  To see them riding that hydrogen balloon-boat wasreminiscent of the solar boat that Ra sails in on his daily journeyacross Egypt (i.e. the Sun's daily journey).  The technology used torepresent this image was highly appropriate, in my opinion.  Forthe characters, they are like gods out to do justice and goodagainst the sea of corruption and evil (which Anubis, Imhotep,Scorpion King and Anck-Su-Namun represented).While the CG is not as great as the first movie, there was new stufftried out which doesn't quite work.  The vast armies of Anubiswarriors and Magi soldiers were fine, but the cg work on the mostbasic of tricks (i.e. the oasis jungle as it is being sucked up) justdidn't work for me.  It looked too crisp.  Perhaps if the spfx peopleused traditional special effects methods, the resulting shots wouldhave looked better.  Also, the Rock's final appearance would havebeen better if he was actually there for filming instead of a cgrendered version of him.",The Mummy Returns
333,keithanddeenie,"Too much, already.",5,8 May 2001,"""The Mummy Returns"" seems so intent on avoiding boredom that it goes in the other direction and simply crushes the viewer with action and detail.  I think the movie also operates on the premise that the audience is stupid. Almost all of the important scenes to come are set up by someone opening with ""It is written ... "" so that we know how the heroes are going to slip the noose even before the danger presents itself.  At least the writers saw how overdone the dialogue was getting and gave John Hannah the line, ""Where is it written?""  But I think the movie is too long and that it could have benefitted from rewriting and editing more than from cute cover-ups.  I am impressed by Arnold Vosloo, the South African actor who portrays Im-Ho-Tep. He has a strong screen presence.  I think that since the writers created an even more super-duper villain in the Scorpion King that Im-Ho-Tep might have evolved into a good guy at the end, as occurred in ""The Terminator"" series. That opportunity is even presented, but slavishly passed over in favor of an incredulous, three-way fight scene at the end.  This movie is hokey, littered with too much glitter and written by formula. It reminds me of those commercials where people ""stop trying"" but still expect to be paid. If anyone has to see this, at least wait until it comes on cable so you can tape it.  Then you can pause the tape for bathroom breaks.  Some of the external reviews were more entertaining than the movie itself.",The Mummy Returns

336,brianwolters,Extremely Disappointing,4,4 January 2005,"THE MUMMY was a surprise hit in 1999. It at all of the elements of the great INDIANA JONES films with a lot of originality. Plus the characters were all likable and the dialogue was extremely witty. Now, we are presented with THE MUMMY RETURNS, a highly disappointing sequel that is loud, noisy and impersonal. The movie opens with background information on The Scorpion King. This is handled well and this movie could have been just about him. Then, without ever getting a title credit, we move to Egypt of 1933. We already see our heroes stumbling upon relics that relate to The Scorpion King. They find an artifact and take it with them, but unknowingly start a trap. Needless to say, they escape back to London with their son, who places the artifact on his wrist and has 7 days to find The Scorpion Kings lair before he dies. This is an interesting movie itself, but no, we forgot about The Mummy. Well, an Anck-Su-Namun look-a-like and others try to resurrect The Mummy so that he can kill The Scorpion King and be ""more powerful."" Confused? I sure was. The plot to THE MUMMY RETURNS is simply a mess. It has too much going on and doesn't stop to let you relate and enjoy the characters. They give you just enough plot to put action sequences around them. The dialogue, while clever at times, is delivered horribly to even attempt to be witty or interesting. Sure, they are saying something but we really don't care, because if it isn't a Mummy soldier chasing them, it is little pigmy skeletons pulling everyone down under the grass similar to the raptor scene in JURASSIC PARK II. The things that made the first one so good (fun characters, good acting) are abandoned for non-stop and numbing action sequences. And on top of that, the movie isn't scary at all. At least the first film had its tense moments. And when the story tries to be tender and serious, you can't help but think, ""It'll be OK."" The special effects are also a problem. It seems as if the filmmakers want to show the effects to you so quickly that they abandon all tension or horror that the first film tried. You can help but think of the droid army in THE PHANTOM MENANCE when you see the ""dog"" army in the desert. How many times do we need to see a mummy or another creature stretch their mouth open wide? It was done a lot in the first film. Seeing it now didn't make it more interesting. And when we finally see The Scorpion King, we are just so overwhelmed that we just want it to be over. It was fun seeing the characters again and how they changed. O'Connell didn't change much. He was given some parental instincts, but the script made them seem forced. Evelyn is much more physical than she was before. She isn't afraid to make a fist and fight and some of this leads to her interesting past. Jonathan is back but he is given the worst dialogue, so it makes him look even more idiotic. The rest of the cast does a good job but is given little to do, including The Mummy himself. I just can't help but feel disappointed and bored with THE MUMMY RETURNS. If they had taken the time to stop and let us enjoy the characters rather than the effects, this could have been a better film.",The Mummy Returns
337,Citymars,Don't be fooled by all the noise,3,14 May 2001,"Don't be fooled by all the noise: this sequel is a mess.  Very few genuine thrills and not a single good scare (or laugh for that matter), but crammed with computer generated special effects that - surprise - look like nothing more than computer generated special effects.  Some of these look cheap and hastily thrown together, especially those involving the growth and later destruction of an oasis.  Others, like the many shots of marauding hordes crossing the desert, already feel old hat.  This does not bode well for the future of cgi-generated armies.This movie steals from everywhere: Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell borrows heavily from Indiana Jones, and the parallel is driven home early on by music that embarrassingly plagiarizes John William's ""Indy"" theme.  There are also a number of strained references to the prior Mummy film, for example, when O'Connell's overly-precocious young son causes the pillars in a tomb to tumble down in a domino effect, it takes awhile to realize this is a joke, one that hearkens back to the first film when his mother (Rachel Weisz) similarly destroys a research library.This is the kind of movie where the good guys survive impossible odds because the bad guys are bad shots (or swordsmen, in this case).  Three different times - once on foot and twice in an airship - the heroes out race rushing water.  ""It's just fun!"" people say.  ""It's supposed to be a cartoon.""

Stephen Sommers story is terrific, picking up just where we'd like to see the couple, Rick & Evie O'Connell and their son.  It reminded me a lot of the Indiana Jones adventures, the Romanticism was fantastic, and I don't just mean the cute love scenes with Brendan & Rachel.  Some of the beauty and scope covered by the cameras was just amazing.  Tying in the strong love the couple has for one another and their ancient pasts to their adventures supports the storyline in a most delightful way.  I found this one to be more fun than the first, it was much grander with a lot more special effects.  Although they may have gotten a bit out of hand with the Matrix-like jumps and kicks, they were not overdone overall, in my opinion, and I especially found the spiraling spear camera shot enjoyable.  The excitement the effects provided was very redeeming.  I also think there was less characterization in this second part, but with more story to replace it.  Although there were some differences between this and The Mummy, there is still enough of the adventure and plot carried through to make this a very enjoyable movie.",The Mummy Returns

That's good cause too many sequels kind of messes up the Saga as most of them tend to be the same.but yeah this was surprisingly a fun movie probably one of the best this year.

344,gregg-39,I was actually BORED!!!!,5,19 May 2001,"I loved the last Mummy film, I thought it had an edge on many other Special effects films today by still having a style reminiscent of older films. Much of the action and atmosphere were similar to Indiana Jones, and it was well scripted and acted.But this sequel lost most of the best stuff, what a pile of tripe!First and very importantly is the fact that the special effects are either the same design as the first film (or even stolen from other films....Velociraptors in the tall grass!!) or.....oooh the shame with such a large budget.....unbelievably poor!! It at times looked more like those really old movies where they just stuck a screen behind the actors that showed lots of scenery, I'm talking big thick black matte lines here!!Also, admittedly I have a thing against children in films (most of them just can't act they simply imitate what they see older actors doing and therefore don't come across natural or like the children they portray), but here the kid always looks like he wants to start laughing.  All he does is come out with all the wise cracks that would normally be given to Fraser's character, and so they are totally out of place and not as funny.The Rock is hardly in it, the acting is mediocre at best, it drags on too much, like too many films it has inferior Matrix style fight sequences in (why oh why does every action film see a need to have martial arts that looks unrealistic and is too fast to look stylish because its just blurry images on the screen?), steals ideas and lines form other films in a way that doesn't do them justice to be a compliment.It was just a big disappointment, there were hardly any laughs or screams in the full cinema theatre and everyone walked out as fast as possible.I have only seen two worse films at the cinema, Street Fighter the Movie and Maybe Baby and both were really bad!!!",The Mummy Returns

This abomination has neither.  It is all Hollywood hype and marketing at its worst, anything to make the buck.  Of course, from a business point of view it is a wild success, just about the most profitable movie opening ever.  No accounting for taste, what?  All this despite the fact that the computer graphics look as though they were designed by a 3 year old (and a not very bright 3 year old at that) and the story written on the fly.  The acting, what there is of it squeezed between the CGI ""action"" sequences which fills most of the movie, is abyssmal.  The female lead looks about as Egyptian as a bowl of borscht.  Nothing hangs together or is even remotely plausible.  I would just hope that anyone who actually wastes their money on this dog (and I don't mean jackal) is fooled into believing that this travesty has any relation whatsoever to real Egyptian history.",The Mummy Returns

My brother and i, on a slightly different topic, find it quite amusing to play this movie backwards, but about the movie itself: going forwards not backwards. The Mummy Returns is basically the mummy again with cooler things in it such as the Pygmy mummies with blowguns.

351,Drew48,A Frantic Second Edition...,6,23 September 2008,"""The Mummy Returns"" is the bigger and flashier sequel to 1999's ""The Mummy"", itself a nicely updated homage to the Boris Karloff classic. The good news is that the excellent cast of the ""The Mummy"" have returned for the sequel. Unfortunately, bigger and flashier does not make up for a lack of plot and character development; ""The Mummy Returns"" is entertaining but ultimately disappointing. The movie opens with a retelling of the Legend of the Scorpion King (played by The Rock) who vanished in ancient times but can be revived with the right magic. Flash forward to the present of 1933, where Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) have married and had time to raise eight-year-old son Alex while continuing their adventures in Egyptian archeology. Unfortunately, the past, both recent and distant, reaches out to touch their lives. Rachel's never-do-well brother Jonanthan (John Hannah) inadavertently draws the attention of a mysterious group seeking to resurrect the past using a bracelet with magical powers. In a chaotic attack on O'Connell Manor, Alex, wearing the bracelet, is kidnapped. The remainder of the movie is a series of set-piece action sequences as Rick, Evie, and Jonathan, accompanied by the Egyptian warrior Ardeth Bey, chase the returned Mummy Imhotep and his army of the dead in order to rescue Alex. A final confrontation at the edge of the Underworld will pit Rick against both Imhotep and the revived Scorpion King. The special effects are the highlight of the movie, each sequence more visually stunning than the last. The Scorpion King in the final scenes looks sadly out of place is what is otherwise a CGI festival. Lacking is a coherent plot or any sense of reverence for the original storyline that made ""The Mummy"" worth watching. At two and a half hours, the movie is overlong, and delivers very little originality. This movie is recommended to those who didn't see the original movie and will enjoy the special effects without missing the storyline.",The Mummy Returns
352,Rhythm-2,The story + the action + the effects = Good sequel!,9,15 October 2001,"I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the movie on DVD (couldn't catch it at the cinema).  The beginning scenes featuring The Scorpion King (a new movie coming out in 2002) did a nice job of showing that this guy could be worse than The Mummy.  I feel that The Mummy Returns excels in showing the connection between the current characters and their Egyptian counterparts. I frankly don't understand the criticism of saying their was NO STORY or the STORY WAS BAD.  Where?  The story is simple and easy to understand.  Does that constitute as BAD.  No it does not.  The action, well that's an understatement.  There's enough quality action to satisfy the hungriest fans.  I found no bad performances in this movie (well the little boy could be a little irritating but what little boys aren't).  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo stand out.  Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lock-Nah) looked like a throwback to the old Spartacas (sp?) type movie characters. Just a quality follow-up to a great movie.

356,stephen.murtagh,This Mummy ain't the Daddy.,6,21 May 2001,"***POTENTIAL SPOILERS****I would like to make one point before all others and that is, for an SFX movie, the SFX were ropey.  They look like they wouldn't be out of place on Xena. Maybe ILM were rushing through them before Star Wars 2 hit pre-production, but they are just obvious and of poor quality.  When ILM are involved I expect the best groundbreaking effects that can be created.  The first Mummy did, this did not.Aside from the cheap looking CGI, the story is poor, but I expected that. What does really annoy me is that the screen time is shared equally between about 10 characters.  This ensures that everything that happens is very shallow and uninvolving, because the audience doesn't get to know anyone at all.  The two best characters, Rick O'Connell and Ardeth become watered down heros that just fight a lot and pop up to save the day in the nick of time i.e. they are merely plot functions - no longer the characters we met back in 1998.  The charm of the two characters and their strengths from the first film aren't built upon, but eroded by their minimal screen time.The child is a waste of screen time who's role in the narrative could have (and should have) been given over to John Hannah's criminally underused character.  In the first film Rachel Weiss made for an excellent damsel in distress, but here she is unable to carry the extra weight.  This may well be more to do with her wafer thin character though, than her talent.  The Mummy himself has but a cameo performance and once again the only word to describe that is 'wasted'.The character of Lock-Nah is wasted horribly.  Early on he is set up as being someone who is as hard as nails.  About 15 minutes later an for the rest of the film, he becomes comic relief.  This problem runs deep through the film.  Ther isn't a sense of danger in this film.  There is not a single point where you can conceivably doubt that the good guys are going to win. No matter what horrible special effects that they face the audience know full well they will emerge unscathed.  Another problem with this film is the action.  It is done in a faux Hong Kong style that doesn't work.  Lots of slow motion and the like.  It doesn't work for two reasons.1) Hong Kong films have done all this before, with smaller budgets and most importantly they have done it BETTER.2) The Hong Kong style looks out of place in an American film that was supposed to be a homage to old adventure serials.  Stephen Sommers should have stuck with the type of old fashioned action seen in the first film, like the shoot out on the boat.This whole film reeks of missed opportunities.  I get the impression that this should have been tightened up in post production and the SFX worked on, so that by Christmas or New year they would have an awesome film.",The Mummy Returns

What we had been waiting for the whole movie, a battle between two legendary warriors, turns out to be pretty lame.I had other problems with the script, such as the strange scene where the kid (Alex) gets kidnapped off the bus.  Alex goes to the back of the bus because his parents are kissing (again), and then... nothing.  Nothing happens for a good two or three seconds.  Alex just kind of stands there, looking around and then, finally someone grabs him.  It looks like someone forgot their cue, and the poor kid had to improvise.  Not to mention the writers' excuse to get Alex away from his parents, is because right after a deadly battle with the undead, they like to make out.And why, oh why, did they even bother to tell us that Rick MIGHT be a Magi? Even when he realized it was true, what good did that do?  That may have been the lamest plot point of all time.Anyway, if you liked The Mummy, you may like this one.  Something tells me that in the original Mummy series from the 30's, that Boris Karloff's sequels were probably just as dumb.",The Mummy Returns

364,morgana-6,Fun fantasy,7,8 July 2002,"I watched my videotape last night with a friend who hadn't seen it (but had seen The Scorpion King, which I hadn't). I was struck again by how much fun is in these two movies. They strike a delightful blend of humor and action. The plot in this one is a bit muddled (don't try to figure out the timeline), but the first time through you just don't notice. If you liked the good guys in the first flick, there is more of them, especially Ardeth Bey and the Mehji. If you liked the sexy mummy, there's more of him too: and you almost feel sorry for him at the end. And then there's the Rock, who lived up to his name. He has just about as much acting ability as his name (which is the main reason I avoided The Scorpion King). I gather wrestling fans were disappointed with how little he was in the film: I was grateful. And I mustn't forget to mention the son of Evie and Rick O'Connell. Normally, I abhor films and tv shows that add children, but this one has all the feisty fearlessness of both of his parents, keeps his head under fire, while keeping the ability of all children to get into trouble. He reminds me of the children/young adults in the Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and that's a compliment. Overall, if you enjoyed the first movie, there's lots you'll like in this sequel. I'd like to see more of them, even without the mummy!",The Mummy Returns
365,Orhan,Worthy Sequel,8,18 May 2001,"Time for truth...Along with the Aliens, Mummy Returns is definitely better-than-its-original sequel that we're not oftenly see. All of the original cast has returned, and gave their unique, brilliant performances. Brendan Fraser is superb as always, I think he is the future Bruce Willis in movie industry, Rachel Weisz performance is at the top (Evelyn character somehow improved and became more smarter), John Hannah is the comic relief just like he was in the first film, Oded Fehr is very cool as Ardeth Bay and finally Arnold Vosloo as Priest Imhotep is great as he was in the first. Among the newly introduced characters, the boy Alex was brilliant all the way. The story of *minor spoiler* Imhotep, Anck Su Namun and Nefertari cleverly revealed, and all the loose ends were tied together completely. You can find all that you want; action, humor, thrill, tense, jump scenes, great visual effects, story twists...The only thing I complain about is *minor spoiler* about The Scorpion King. He has very little screen time and at the end when we see his *major spoiler* scorpion form, the visual effects are not quite good compared to the other visualization in the whole picture. Other than that, Mummy Returns is a worthy sequel that really deserved to be seen. I saw it, and I will see it again.",The Mummy Returns
366,steveha,Light adventure is more fun than original,8,8 May 2001,"I felt that the _The Mummy_ suffered from bad pacing and lack of a consistent tone.  Sometimes it was goofy and funny, other times we were supposed to cringe in horror._The Mummy Returns_ has a generally light tone; in general we only see bad things happen to bad people, and the bad things aren't dwelt on.This movie is less about horror and more about swashbuckling action, of which it has plenty.If you watch it, try to ignore the plot holes and enjoy the action.",The Mummy Returns
367,Trawet,Fight scenes are cartoonish!,6,5 May 2001,"I loved the first one. So I was really looking forward to seeing The Mummy Returns. But as I sat watching it, I found myself feeling uncomfortable. The fight scenes are shown speeded up,slightly blurred and with in your face closeups. Kind of cartoonish. The sound is very loud and there were way too many special effects. No real story, just lots and lots of action. A bit like wrestling. My four year old loved it, which is probably somewhat the audience they were aiming for. I gave it a 6, I liked a lot of it. Just wish they had toned it down. I saw the first Mummy movie three times and bought both DVD's. Probably won't buy this one.",The Mummy Returns
368,Mojo-Jojo,Fun but disappointing,6,5 May 2001,"It is always said to see when a director and writer sacrifices what might have been a quality story for special effects. This is the case with the sequel to Stephen Sommer's ""The Mummy"". I sort of knew this would be the case when looking at the previews they showed several scenes with the army of Anubis marching across the desert but none of the story. This is because while the story was there and it was interesting, it was nothing to write home about. There was one review I read that compared Rick O'Connel (Fraser) to Indiana Jones. Fedora hat included this comparison may be accurate but this movie is better compared with the second of the Indy sequels which by all accounts was not as good as the first or third Indy movies.
This movie introduces itself very well. The first half hour is very entertaining as we are shown all the main characters and told basically what to expect. The problems happen about the point where the characters find themselves on the way back home to London. There are all these guys running around in red suits and we have no idea what their motivation is other than wanting to wake up Mr. walking talking corpse. Why would you want to do that? They never explain it. From that point on the movie is fun (don't get me wrong - it was fun to watch) but it lacked the original's originality. The humor, I am happy to say, is still present and made for good times.The other day I watched the original movie with the director's commentary turned on and got a glimpse of why this movie is the way it is from Mr. Sommer's comments. There is no doubt that he is talented but he should have stuck with creating a good story and then hired ILM to do the SFX. I won't comment on ""The Rock"" as he in only in the movie for about 15 minutes and his role is... different.6 out of 10",The Mummy Returns

We are reminded of the wonderful storyline of the first movie in between the constant battles. I love action movies but I prefer to have a some storyline thrown in.I actually fell asleep in the theatre on this, luckily  the kid behind me kicking my chair kept me from snoring . The characters walked, ran, and jumped from scene to scene and battle to battle, with a few bits of story in between. The special effects were wonderful, the acting was good, but overall the movie could have been rewritten to capture the same action/comedy/adventure that made the first one so entertaining.I would have much prefered to see some of the special effects budget given to a writer, and even more to make the final battle look less cartoonish.",The Mummy Returns

Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, playing the married O'Connell couple, have impressive on-screen chemistry. Return performances by John Hannah and Oded Fehr further increase the movie's excellence.

372,0rbita1,"Entertaining, adrenalin-filled yet formulaic no-brainer action romp, as the good guys go from London to Egypt to stop the evil Scorpion King/Imhotep/Mummy/Pinky and the Brain from taking over the world. Agai",8,10 July 2001,"It's 1933 and, ten years on from their last encounter with the bandaged one, Rick and Evie are happily married and living in London with their 8-year old son. Yet Evie is troubled by strange visions of ancient Egypt and the fabled Bracelet of Anubis, the control of which will bring about the resurrection of the Scorpion King. This would be (you guessed it) a bad thing to happen, as said King sold his soul to the evil god Anubis and, upon his return to life, would lead Anubis' nigh-on invincible army to take over the WORLD! Oh and, in case this wasn't enough, Imhotep has also been exhumed and revived by his followers, in the hope that he can defeat the Scorpion King and twist the inhuman army to his own fiendish desires. Muhahahahahaha. Sorry.The first 'blockbuster' of this Summer, 'The Mummy Returns' is a lot of fun, as long as you abide by one simple rule: do not, under any circumstances, think about what you're watching. Cerebral content, as in the original, is sacrificed to stop anything getting in the way of the constant stream of fights, stunts and special effects and, happily, it has the same effect. Where this sequel succeeds over many others is in maintaining the level of exuberance and excitement which made the original such a success. The extra budget means that the set pieces are far bigger, the explosions far more spectacular, the extras are far more plentiful (and we all know what that means), and the locations far more grandiose. Luckily, much of the CGI has been improved as well. Some truly innovative little nasties are introduced (the skeletal pygmies being the high point), and the decaying Imhotep won't leave you sniggering behind your hand this time. The original cast are clearly having just as much fun second time around (even new additions like Freddie Boath, the Connell's eight year old son, stay on the right side of irritating), and the self-aware, tongue-in-cheek scripting of the first film also makes a welcome return.If anything lets 'TMR' down, it's the sense of excess and keenness to entertain. With access to the kind of money the first 'Mummy' film only dreamt of, Sommers sometimes throws just a little too much into the visuals and it doesn't all work. Some of the CGI is decidedly ropey, and other ideas (the jet-powered dirigible in particular) simply stretch credulity that little bit too far. In truth, the plot is merely a very loose framework to hang the action on (writing the very instructions needed to kill you off again should you reawaken in your own tomb seems a little foolhardy), and The Rock really shouldn't give up his day job. Yet, to be truthful, who cares? The pace and rhythm of the film is so relentless that such faults can be ignored, as they really defeat the object. I defy you to sit through the London Bus chase scene and the Mansion house fight and keep a regular, unwavering pulse. Yes it's corny and yes it's totally and unceasingly OTT, but this is Sinbad not Indiana Jones, replete with legendary monsters, handsome lantern-jawed hero and feisty heroine. If you want intelligent, thought-provoking and mysterious material then look elsewhere. Otherwise, strap yourself in and enjoy the ride.7.5/10Matt Drew",The Mummy Returns
373,outadisworld,One of the best movies of all time,9,10 December 2001,"(mild spoilers) Most people might be frighntend off by the idea of a sequal, and they have a reason to be. Jurassic Park and Star Wars may be the only movies ever that it's sequals were supior to the originals. Up on to now, that is. The Mummy Returns starts off with High Quality Butt Kicking Action that left me savouring every mili second right up to the last scene.What Made this movie greater than the original? Well, There was a lot less explaining and more fighting than the first. Not to mention, The movie was all-together more impressive with it's special effects, high paced corregrahed action sequences and even more drama than it's prequal.There were some heavy downsides too. For Instance, the special effects may of been much more impressive than in the Mummy, but are specks of dust compared to movies such as The Matrix, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menance and others of that class. Another serious problem were some of the scene's were imitating the first movie. For instance, The Scene wear the Mummy cause the windstorm to bear his face and chase Rick O'Conner in the air plane, almost the exact smae thing happened when the Mummy caused a tidal wave to bear his face and chase O'Connel in a hot air balloon. Even though the Tidal wave was more imaginitive and thrilling than the sand storm, one cant help thinking that the wirters could of thought of something more original.

Sheer stupidity in a movie rankles me.... so the demise of both the kid and Brandon's grasping brother(Jonathan)would have improved the film....Too bad that there was not more of the Scorpion King(The Rock)in... especially in the closing scenes it seemed fairly obvious that computer generation ruled the roost....Imhotep's return was just that, but his date(Velasquez) was more evil....Same old, same old tricks by Imhotep, though somehow not as scary this time...The lovely Rachel Weisz is lovely and fits the role... Brendan Fraser could've slept through this... I saw no stretch for him from the first movie to this one, except excessive and inappropriate 'snogging', especially on the bus...I'm surprised Brendan Fraser's character wasn't a little more in control of his son, but I guess the makers decided they needed some sort of plot line, so they put a child in the line of danger to give some direction to the film..... Uuuuuurggggh!!!!! Am I the only one that found the boy's actions/interfering/meddling irritable? and Jonathan's continual self-enrichment program so unnecessary? I could only hope that Mummy 3 (if it gets made)can kill off the kid and his brother.... maybe they can use that as a story line with revenge for the deaths as the driving plot-line?.....Definitely NOT as good as the first Mummy film, .... by a long shot!

It's a movie about a freaking resurrected mummy, for crying out loud, i think that should be anyone's first hint that viewers are in for a nice little detour from reality, and all tghe better for it. Picking up several years after the adventures of the first film, we rejoin what is now the O'Connell family as they cross paths with Imhotep once again, this time in an effort to stop him from raising a supernatural army that would allow him to conquer the world. The Mummy Returns is the sort of movie that makes a fun distraction on a lazy Saturday afternoon, not unlike the hokey, cheesy (but nonetheless entertaining) monster movies i grew up with. If you can put down your pretensions that every movie should be or should even strive to be the highest form of art, make yourself some popcorn, sit back, put a few parts of your brain in neutral and just enjoy the ride.

It started you off on a roller coaster ride and didn't let up until the credits rolled. The plot was a little thin, but who cared! There were enough thrills, chills, spills, and laughs to more than make up for it. Brendan Frasier was great and Oded Fehr was wonderfully dark and sexy. There was that terrific chemistry between Rick and Evie and I thought Evie's brother Jonathan was hysterically inept and greedy but ultimately heroic. Little Alex was a wonderful addition to the cast and not just a child character used to make up for shortcomings in the script.  The final poignant scenes of Im-Ho-Tep and Anck-Su-Namun were surprising showing a redeming side of him.

Im sure it took countless hours to come up with the plot for the sequel. I did not notice any plot errors. Are there?I think Freddie Booth gave a fabulous performance. I can't wait to see him in future films. He is a doll. Rachel Weisz also did a wonderful job. The acting was overall top notch. The one thing that bothered me was the Scorpion King. When he returns he does NOT look real. I wish they had taken ""The Rocks"" head and someone integrated it into the scorpian king body. I think that would have made it appear more realistic.

I think it's the first time there's a kid in a movie that I don't feel like kicking.

You can guess almost any scene in the movie. The acting only helps the story to jump from one effect-scene to the next. Too many special effects destroy a movie and it seems like Hollywood doesn't understand this at all. The movie's an entertaining thrill-ride worth spending two hours in the cinema, but you'll forget about the movie the next day, because it's a heartless movie that totally lacks innovation and surprises.

I'll leave that for you to decide.But now that the film is in theaters, let's make it known to the masses that the script is aimless, the action is exhausting and relentless, and the dialogue, well...Nevermind.  Who cares, right?  It doesn't matter that the film lacks substance, because we are just going to see the special effects anyway!So let's talk about the special effects.Well, they stink, frankly.  The FINAL FANTASY reject lobster referred to as the Scorpion King is really quite pathetic.  But no, wait, we are also treated to these little Pygmy-mummies that move at a dizzyingly fast speed, a speed that prevents us from really focusing on them.  After a while, I honestly had to look away--the creations are so terribly rendered, I just couldn't take it.  Wait!  One more, I must.  In the middle, an evil mummy summons the Nile to rise up and chase after our heroes in their dirgible. Cool idea, but the ""water effect"" is laughable.If those three examples aren't enough, rest assured that there are a hundred others where they came from.  I just don't have time or space to mention them all.Dammit, if there are 100 million or so dollars spent on effects, I sure as hell would like to see that money on-screen.  Otherwise, save the money!My friends tell me that I'm too critical.  ""You've gotta leave your brain at the door, sit back and just watch it.""  And so I did.  I've ""forgotten"" that the dialogue is terrible and the pace is a mess. I've ""forgotten"" it all.If this is a movie about special effects...well the special effects are arguably the worst part.  So there.I really want studios to reexamine their priorities in effects films.  This whole CG overkill that has come about with TITANIC and THE PHANTOM MENACE and GLADIATOR has gotten way out of hand.  It's NOT REAL!  And it's NOT EVEN BELIEVABLE!  Bring back ANIMATRONICS!  Bring back some form of suspension of disbelief to the cinema.  CG is just not the same.  Make me, if only for a second, believe that I'm watching ancient armies collide in the desert. Make me try to believe that there is a giant Man-Scorpion standing in front of me.  Please pretend that there is some form of intelligence in the audience.  I'm not saying to get rid of CG (it's a great and sometimes necessary invention), but just remember, when you're filming those giant battles: nothing beats the real thing.Oh well, that's a whole other story.But it's really the least they should have done with this 100 million dollar goose egg.",The Mummy Returns
382,Muzman,It's...a sequel!,5,14 May 2001,"Bigger! Louder! Dumber! More! Before you have time to be confused they'll be on to the next bit! It's to be expected I guess; the only way to out-do the first one is to chuck any shred of historical feel (plus the pace, the dialogue and spread the CG budget so thin it looks like Babylon 5 at times). In the first few sequences it's obvious what happened; using every male bodybuilder in the world as an extra forced them to blow out the catering budget on protein shakes. This movie lacked any thrilling aspect, any tension. The leads felt like they were in a dull bubble of safety no matter how many times they were kidnapped (which was a lot), being shot at (also a lot) or dangling from somewhere dangerous (which seemed to happen anywhere they were more than a metre above sea level). Sure, in this kind of matinee pulp we all ""know"" that the good guys are going to make it, but there can still be the odd thrill of risk and close shaves. The only guy who seemed to be working for a living in this was Oded Fehr, as the long suffering Ardeth Bey. He probably got the lowest pay rise after the first one and then he has to carry the film! A pity really, since the bad guys were pretty good for the most part. Patricia Velasquez and Arnold Vosloo (playing crazy dead people) had more humanity than their white hatted counterparts. (*spoilers!*)And what the hell is wrong with letting them live?!  Can't we skip the resurrection schtick for just one film (the next one)? Or at least reduce it a little.  The amount of time it took in this one didn't help.  The next one will need a score card.(/spoilers)It's tough to talk about films like this and criticizing them without the suggestion that you've taken it too seriously. You're supposed to relax and go along with it. Well that's what the first one did, it was Raiders of the Lost Ark meets Army of Darkness. It was bright and breezy and had lots of character.

383,docmonster,A Modern Movie For A Simpler Time,8,16 May 2001,"""The Mummy Returns"" plays like a film made in the forties when Universal produced four sequels to the original ""The Mummy"" (1932). Though I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think most classic monster fans will, it may seem out of place to today's more ""sophisticated and enlightened"" movie crowd.The movie's all about fun and high-adventure and it delivers in spades on both! It contains all of the excitement, thrills and intrigue that can be found in the adventure serials of the thirties and forties.  Whether intentional or not, the CGI creature effects hearkened back to the days of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen. Though much smoother than their stop-motion techniques, there was an obvious separation between the computer world and the real world. This added a kitschy feel to the film which I loved. When this movie is released for home viewing, I plan on watching it in black and white to get the complete 1940's feel!The bottom line: If you go to the theatre to be entertained and to escape the real world, go see ""The Mummy Returns"", the kid inside you will thank you for it!",The Mummy Returns

385,clanpainless,as expected...,8,18 May 2001,"the movie was as i'd expected. as usual sequals often depend less on storyline and more on things like action, humor and special effects. not that a storyline is always very important (i think it's often overrated very much), but the mystiqe of the first movie simply wasn't there anymore. the two most irritating things in the movie were probably the ""return"" of the scorpion king as a scorpion (i'd rather like to see him as a man) and most of all the fact that imhotep's girlfriend abandoned him at the end. but then again, here i'm almost making the same big mistake as most filmcritics do: checking storyline. who cares in a movie like this? o.k. the story isn't all that, and there are quite some mistakes, unlike the first movie, but sowhat? it is a great fun movie to watch and THAT'S what it's all about! period!.",The Mummy Returns

Imhotep and anck-su-namun were so in love there was no way she would have run off like a coward and left him to die. This is the same woman that stabbed herself in the stomach in the first movie! If anything, she would have hurled herself into that fiery pit with Imhotep. This scene really spoiled the movie for me and up to that point I was having a great time.Yes, the Scorpion King looked like a plastic jerk and the CGI wasn't up to snuff, but you couldn't help being entertained by it. It was exciting, action packed and managed to squeeze in some great battle scenes, love scenes, and even an ancient fight scene between women (Nefertiri and anck-su-namun).Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bey) has to be one of the hottest actors on the planet! The man is simply gorgeous and quite talented. He is definitely leading man material. There were so many good looking men to drool over: Ardeth, Rick and Imhotep. If I were Evy, I'd want to date both Ardeth and Rick and decide (much, much later) which one I wanted to marry. Okay, so marry Rick, live an upper-class life in England with your husband and son, but at least experience Ardeth first. Spend a few months out in the desert with this hunk and get a little ankle tattoo to remember him by! I felt sorry for Imhotep, and in this movie, he didn't seem to be the bad guy at all. I thought he had gotten a raw deal in the first Mummy anyway. He was just in love with the wrong woman and was willing to sacrifice everything to be with her. Who wouldn't have gotten ""a little riled"" at having one's tongue cut out, being buried alive and slowly eaten by scarabs, and then having an eternal curse put on you! I would have returned and kicked a few asses too. In this movie, all he seemed to really want was to be with anck-su-namum again. She was the monster in this one, if you ask me.Imhotep really didn't seem to have his heart into ""ruling the world"" and seemed happier once he was reunited with her, only to have her run off and leave him to die. I had tears in my eyes along with him and you could see he was heartbroken and no longer cared what happened to him. Here is little Evy dodging falling columns and leaping over breaking ground to save her man and anck-su-namun was supposed to be the bad-ass female warrior who would do anything for her man. She got what she deserved though and I cheered as the scarabs picked her bones clean. Too bad Imhotep couldn't have seen that! They never really explained how anck-su-namun was reincarnated in the first place. She just shows up in 1930s clothes, with a new name and spouting English like a native.Evy seems to have lost her sense of humor and ditzy ways in this one all together. I guess thats what 10 years of marriage and having a bratty kid will do for you. Now, she is a no nonsense, humorless, treasure seeker (instead of the librarian she proudly proclaimed herself to be in The Mummy) and just didn't seem as much fun as she used to be. Her clothes seemed awfully revealing for 1933 too. She is still very beautiful but just boring - even with her new butt kicking skills.The little boy's role was totally unbelievable. Not his acting - he did a decent job with what he was given - but he seemed to act more like a child of 12 or 13 years instead of 8. He was too self possessed, too articulate and too brave. Nothing scared him, he apparently had artistic talent well beyond his years (perfect sand depictions of ancient Egyptian cities and monuments were left as clues for his parents), he read and understood ancient Egyptian words that he wouldn't have really grasped even in English. He didn't seem upset when he thought that he lost both his parents in the dirigible crash and didn't shed a tear when he saw his mother knifed before his eyes. Just matter of fact and ready to go on with his life. The brother didn't even seem upset either. Now thats taking the stiff upper lip British thing too far! (Okay lads, she's dead, let's get on with our trip and try to get back to London safely in time for dinner shall we?)",The Mummy Returns

""The Mummy Returns"" has lots of props and effects and action, butno depth, pacing, or inspirational force.""The Mummy Returns"" is so blatantly manipulative that it fails tomanipulate in a way that you can really appreciate.  It iscookie-cutter to the max with no transitional spaces betweenmoods.  In fact it moves so quickly that it fails to establish any sortof mood except a caricature of chaotic bewilderment.  There's nocharacter development, so the characters remain largely onedimensional.  There's no depth to the story or the acting.  It breaksall ""show don't tell"" rules by exposing the background throughthickly applied 'convenient dialogue' between characters, who 'justhappen' to explain complex elements of the historical background. There's enough action and rough plot material for three films, butcramming it all into one just makes for a cartoonish spasm of amovie.  Oh, and with $100,000,000 to spend, you'd think they'd at least getsomeone with a mastery of English to read the script; characterskept using ""magi"" (which is the plural of ""magus"") as a singularnoun when they'd certainly have known better.  Yes, the CGI is good in places, but it would be nice to use it inservice of a story instead of in place of a story.  The PhantomMenace had similar failings.",The Mummy Returns
391,Antiknown,I want this two hours of my life back!!!! Boooo,3,5 May 2001,"When you go into the theater, I guess you're supposed to be entertained and feel good by the time you leave. You're supposed to be whisked off to faraway places with clever characters and get lost in that feeling...and enjoy it. Ah, The Mummy Returns...Sure, you're whisked away to foreign lands with wonderful scenery. Sure, there's action and adventure. But can it pass off as entertainment? In my opinion, anyone with an intelligence level that surpasses the 6th grade should be disappointed. And if you aren't: shame on you. This film seems to have been made by drooling mongoloids and only is intended to be enjoyed by the same.Honestly, if this movie would have followed the premise and the story of The Scorpion King, I believe this could have been a decent film. The only things that the element of The Scorpion King does is: Get another big name into the film to make it look good while marketing it and to clutter up the story (if there really ever was one!).Look here folks, we all know the purpose of this film was made to make money. That's the bottom line. Am I wrong in expecting maybe something DECENT in return for paying for admission. You can take ANY part of the dialogue in the entire movie (and even the plot itself) and imagine this movie being written by a couple of 8 year old kids playing in the sandbox with some X-men and G.I. Joe figures. Its just THAT mindless.If you want a film in a similar vein that is of better quality, check out The 13th Warrior. But, if you're determined to see this movie, the only redeeming points you should find are The Rock's reported Eight Million dollar performance (for 5 minutes in the movie) and the stunning Rachel Weisz. I honestly believe she was the only thing that kept me watching. For those two factors, I am giving it a generous 3 out of 10. BEWARE, YOU WERE WARNED!!!",The Mummy Returns

This is not a movie you could easily fall asleep to.  It's got some good humor, and it has two love stories in it as well, so not just men will enjoy this movie.

396,johnphilo1,Pretty Awful,1,22 May 2005,"The dialog in this movie is some of the worst ever produced - makes the script of Billy Madison seem creative. There is not a single moment of genuine conversation or communication between the main characters. It is one endlessly annoying parade of 'witty' clichés and repartees strung end to end for an interminable two hours. The awful dialog takes an otherwise average movie and turns it into a positively awful one. The story is passable. The special effects are good, though the action scenes are a bit more derivative than the first. The main characters are terrible actors but that doesn't really matter in this genre. In sum, avoid this movie if you can and for certain do not pay to view it, but if you are stuck with nothing else on cable at 4:00 am, watch it with the sound off (you won't miss anything) and you should make it through relatively unscathed and with most of your remaining brain cells intact.",The Mummy Returns

This movie was pretty good up until the Scorpion King/The Rock arrived. Why is it that some movies rely upon children to be a center piece? Jurassic Park, JP 2, JP 3 (which, you simply wished Eric would be eaten), and now The Mummy Returns. Alex is annoying and not funny in the least (see the differences in the third Mummy). Jonathon proves his worth by becoming an ace marksman, which isn't carried into the third installment. Evie (sp?) is suddenly the reincarnation of King Ramases' daughter Nefertiti AND, while looking fantastic in the ancient wardrobe, is an expert sai fighter (which weren't in Egypt at the time -it originated in the Asian subcontinent and were used primarily in Okinawa).

First of all, I give every movie a chance.  I am the type of person who usually finds one positive in every movie, and I did find one here.  The panoramic desert scenes were awesome, but the rest of the movie sucked.  The script was cheesy, many of the special effects were easily detectable as fake, the theme was stupid, the story confusing, plot and characterization were non existent.  I didn't care what happened to any of these people, they could have all died, I just wanted my money back.  I fell asleep 5 times, and I usually don't pay 8 bucks for a nap.  That only goes to show that all movies out now stink because when this movie can do better than most at the box office, that's pathetic.

402,Logan313,Nearly Ruined by CGI,7,5 May 2001,"The Mummy Returns captured my attention for months as I followed the trailers and news online regarding it's contents.  I was very excited when I purchased the tickets ahead of time yesterday afternoon, and more excited when I saw that the shows had ALL sold out.  It appeared people were as excited and curious as I was.The Mummy Returns presents us with the return of our favorite characters, or not-so-favorite if you had questionable thoughts about the first.  It is overdone on the CGI all throughout, and even a little child would be able to notice the created waterfall.  C'mon guys... pixels are bad!The fighting scenes were great, aside from the final which was again destroyed by the CGI.  The characters were more developed, and we were able to see the magi more, as I would have liked in the first.  The story keeps you going, and the movie never slows down; I didn't have to readjust in my seat once!The actors do a very good job and bring that comicbook style Indiana Jones to the screen.  Yes, I said Indiana Jones.  It's not, okay!  Don't go into this movie thinking it's a Spielberg production that's now a cult-classic trilogy.After seeing this, I am anticipating the Scorpion King and will be there purchasing my tickets ahead of time for it.  Do I think this movie will be the summer's biggest hit?  Not too sure.  There are some other great ones out there, but if you've been very depressed with the recent craptastic movies that have been released (Crocodile Dundee III) then I'd say you need to redeem your money's worth from that theatre and go see Mummy Returns.",The Mummy Returns
403,Jeremy Farrance,Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) Filmmaking at its Best!,4,7 May 2001,"Oh my.  Watching this movie was a great experience in and of itself.  It paid homage to LOTS of other movies and spun up the laughs and thrills at a rate that no cliche can pay its proper respects to.  I even left the theater ""feeling"" like I had seen a good movie.  But you know what?  It wasn't that good.  I am hoping those of you that jumped online and gave it a Vote of 10 will reconsider after a few days have gone by.  This movie was definitely a 5 or 6 at best.  How do I justify that?  Go watch Aliens again, that's how. Go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark or Lost Crusade.  Go watch ANY movie that leaves the camera pointing at anything for longer that 4 seconds without a ""cut"".If you have to see it, please go see it on the big screen.  If you go in not expecting much, you will be blown away... at least for a little while.  My biggest concern is that I feel like we, the general public, have just put our heads in the noose.  We all gave this movie the 2nd all time biggest opening weekend of any movie so far in history.  Those Hollywood money-types just love that.  Why a noose?  Because we have just helped give the green light to 100s of other average and bad movies that sound good on paper - I'm sorry, I meant to say ""sound like a formula similar to the Mummy Returns"".These movies are fine, when they are good - and don't get me wrong, the Mummy Returns was good, just not great or excellent or awesome.  It was just ""good"".  But I want more GREAT movies.  I want to see more movies like Panic, Memento, Tailor of Panama, Out of Sight, Aliens, etc.The Mummy Returns has me pretty worried about what kind of movies we will be handed next year and the year after.  What do you think?",The Mummy Returns
404,martin_bilodeau,the receipt is been useful,7,17 May 2001,"you waited it, it now arrived the entertainment of the summer (and the year). But which says entertainment does not say necessarily intelligent.Writer and director, Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Deep Rising) reiterate his bet, that of concocter a diverting film, a giant blockbuster, a cinematographic carcass made up immenses blocks... with much money (95 million dollars spent well in the circumstances).In fact, one associates (always) movie of year with pure american entertainment; Could The Mummy Returns does not dislodge with the rule, how it? One often says that blockbuster has the resources which do one of them, but this one wants to be the cream of the cream. Characters attaching, coloured and alive, slight amount of romantic, mirobolants effects and three-dimensional, well introduced humour, history folded back with simplest without possible confusion (interesting and comprehensible, this is not what I seek this kind of production?); ambiance total appears dynamic, thorough, energetic and visually splendid and spectacular.All the estival ingredients pullulate in this Hollywood production (turned mainly to Africa and England) for our greater pleasure. If he's necessary to have waiting, that's to be diverted well of the whole beginning to the any end, nothing else. If you move for other thing, you knocked with bad... fall. No ounce of reflexion, therefore impossible to split hairs; no chance to win oscar, therefore it will not pass to history and its later range will not be deep. Can one be upset with him with the scenario writer not to have thought of including a certain psychological level? Never, that's an entertainment. The only reason so that we  remember it in the years to come will be the seal collected with the box office (68, 1 million dollars during a weekend. WOW! ).Mainly, which is worth the turning, it is that the film makes us pass one excellent moment - on this subject, I will lie down month tightened this evening. Except for exception (Terminator II), rare are the films which enjoy a sequel to offer the package to us whose container dazzles us, does not leave us indifferent, wants to be higher than its baby; a sequel which does not leave us perplexed.In what milked with story just as it is, it is necessary to remember the first episode, but that of the second does not want to be complicated. I would say that it is is higher than this type of production. Does the scenario writer take necessary time to analyse, to explain and then to show us the continuation of the events... special effects. The narrative frame thus is well wrapped by the orgy of the visual effects, and the characters who make it up, installation to attract crowd. At all events, the only thing of which you must remember is it is about an ENTERTAINMENT, a big BLOCKBUSTER (as they are liked), nothing else. Remember this. If the first were compared with new Indiana Jones (not for me in any case), the second appears out of this category. If the producers want to copy this famous archaeologist, they must go to be repaired; they are beside the "" track "" and have not completely to find the whip corresponding - I prefer to await the fourth of the series Indiana Jones. The return of the mummy is an action movie which is caught for an adventure movie. There is the great negative point. history told definitely lower and is thought than his false friend; it is less true, less historical, less serious, less dramatic and less adventurous in more than the contribution humorous less and not very subtle (but it is very effective...). And is it not there that you say that one is a movie adventure and the other is an action movie, disguised that one to me? I love you, one thus returns to the starting point, sensational...What disappoints in the movie prove the end (the interior final scene frontwith Mr WWF disguised in scorpion for the needs for film... ridiculous but obvious). we almost don't believe. The effects are atrocious, null and incredible (undoubtedly only the most negative pushing back).
Then with you to judge if you will then move (after having seen this of course film, because you must see it entertainment to perfect your psychology) for the third opus of the Mummy which will be entitled - with less that it changed - THE SCORPION KING (currently in turning) with The Rock itself and Michael Clarke Duncan (the giant of THE GREEN LINE) planned initially for fall 2001, but without the original actors...

However, if you're the type of person who likes to pick apart every movie you see, then you won't enjoy this. The plot is weak and there are numerous scenes which don't make sense. It's also very predictable. I enjoyed the movie because of the numerous villains, there weren't just the 1 or 2 bad guys, but there were 5 or 6, and each was paired with a different ""hero"" to fight them.

Of course, I'm not saying the original was any goodto begin with. Actually, I'm not even sure they didn't just basicallyrecut the same old movie and tag one or two new characters andthen release it under this new title! In any event, I took my 7 year old boy to see the movie and he hada ball. Come to think of it, I was pretty well entertained also. Plotdetails are too silly (and inconsequential) to get into. Suffice to say,the title character (the sullen Imhotep) is somehow resurrectedand, by some contrivance, once again must face the meddling ofBrendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz (now married with a tow headedJunior Egyptologist as their son) and the bumbling brother-in-lawJohn Hannah. Mysterious native good-guy Ardeth Bey is also backas are the usual Indiana Jones inspired assortment of swarthypower (or money) hungry villains. The new twist involves the legendary character of the ScorpionKing (WWF's The Rock in his well suited -- and undemanding --debut performance) whose legend is laid out in a tidy openingsequence set some 5000 years in the past. Suffice to say, theforces of both good and evil are concerned with the ScorpionKing's resurrection and the ancient prophesy that would releasethe evil Egyptian God Anubis' army of the undead upon theunsuspecting world. Do I have to keep it a secret as to whoprevails?The movie is charged with energy and the action doesn't let uplong enough for anyone to groan over the scripts numerousattempts at machismo-levity in the face of great peril (a hallmark ofFraser's). In the end, the movie, like its predecessor, strives to bean Indiana Jones episode. And, as with its predecessor, it comesoff as a 2nd rate imitation. It just tries too hard and the strain bogsthe film down. What's most surprising about this movie is howdisappointing the special effects turn out to be. The seams reallyshow during several crucial sequences. Most egregious of all isthe CGI figure of the resurrected Scorpion King as a half man/halfscorpion creature. What is supposed to look like The Rock's headand upper torso, looks like one of the human characters from ToyStory. Those Ray Harryhausen stop motion creatures from theSinbad movies would have been more effective.I would recommend The Mummy Returns for everyone who enjoyed the first movie. It's not a bad family fright movie either.While the action may be intense for the smallest movie-agekiddies, the violence is quite bloodless. Most harrowing foryoungsters might be the scene where the decomposed Imhotep""sucks"" the skin off of three victims (who kind of deserved itanyway, in the morality of the narrative) in order to reconstitute hisown flesh. It sounds worse than it actually appears on film, believeit or not. Actually, so does this movie.",The Mummy Returns
407,paulmst3k,Mind-numbing,2,3 August 2001,"Mummy Returns is, as expected, way worse than the origional.  It pales in comparison.  And, sadly enough, the first Mummy isn't very good at all!So much to say why this movie didn't work: *SPOILERS AHEAD* 1. The plot is just cluttered with tons of legends, ancient stories, ancient artifacts, bracelets, spears, gods, armies of destruction and other such nonsense. ex. ""They wake up Ahmontep to wake up and kill the Scorpion King who made a pact with so-and-so and got condemmed for ever, so Ahmontep can have his dark army, but he needs the bracelet to wake him up, and some Spear to kill whoever, and who knows how the O'Connells got the spear in the first place.""  All of this confusing stuff is in the first 30 minutes, mind you, and everything plot-wise becomes cloudy and muddled.  The big problem with Mummy Returns, is that it's just not simple enough. 2.  All the heiroglyphics, that everyone can read, say dumb stuff that would nobody would ever bother to carve. ""This way to Scorpion King.""  ""He who disturbs this chest (there are numerous chests) will surely die.""  And why would they carve how to kill the Scorpion King (with the sceptre of Osiris) in his own temple?! 3.  The ever-annoying Alex.  He's way to brave and smart for his own good. He's not even cute, and his one-liners are very contrived and not funny. Why doesn't he just write the name of where they are going instead of building sand sculptures?  And where did he get that British accent?  His parents don't talk like that! 4.  The dazzling special-effects that we expect from every movie these days were non-existant.  The airship idea was incredibly stupid, and it didn't look that cool.  The tiny pygmies.  Where did they come from, and what is their purpose?  Who knows.  But they weren't that cool, and had no motivation.  I wasn't scared.  Anubis army, they were okay, but they looked awkward and most of all, fake.  And the graphics of the Scorpion King at the end were extremely laughable.  It looked like something out of a video game. As for the fight scenes, Is it just me or is anyone else sick of seeing slow-motion every time a punch is thrown? 5.  All aspects of the movie have failed, now it's time to see what we came for.  The Rock.  He's actually a pretty good actor.  Oh, wait, he's only in the movie for a few minutes in the beginning.  In spite of this, he graces almost every poster or promotional item for Mummy Returns.  Why didn't they place ""Bad Soldier #3"" on the poster?  I mean, he was in the movie just as long!  Another prime example of Hollywood just out to squeeze dollars out of everyone.That concludes my synopsis.  When I see this type of movie I don't expect ""Citizen Kane,"" or Shakespeare, but I do expect something a little bit more valuable than this drivel.  Something that shows a worthy effort by the actors and the writing team, by someone who didn't read ""Archaeology for Dummies,"" before he started.  Anyways, watch the first Mummy or the perfect example of an action/adventure/comedy movie done right, ""Indiana Jones."" This movie is just another LOUD Hollywood Blockbuster sequel trying to make money off the coat-tails of the semi-popular predecessor.  In that respect, it succeeded marvelously.  Otherwise, it's just another forgettable film where nothing is tangible, nothing is sacred, nothing is genuine, nothing is good.",The Mummy Returns

I was scary too, which it was meant to be , however, it was more funny than scary. I don't know why the genre is not Comedy in IMDB. And last but not least, it was emotional and somehow romantic too.

The Mummy Returns just goes to show how technology, which is suppose to enhance the visual aspect of an actual story, has been manipulated so that movies nowadays are only about how cool stuff looks onscreen without taking any interest to the film itself. And on top of that, this movie's visual effects weren't even good. It just looked like Brenden Fraser in a cheap cartoon. This kind of modern raping of the cinema has most likely ruined the minds of the mass viewers.

The only reason I rented it in the first place was because the first was enjoyable and fun, but this was unbearable. Brendan Fraiser and Rachel Weiz's son was stubborn and over-courageous, which would be fine if he could shut up with his lame comments every five seconds. His British accent (where'd that come from?) didn't help matters. The story in this sequel is considerably worse than the first, which was never great but could at least grab attention. It's always a bad sign when somehow people are able to be brought back to life over and over, therefore killing excitement or suspense during action. In the end, I didn't have any more endurance and the last ten minutes went right over my head (but what I do remember wasn't any good either).",The Mummy Returns
417,SteveL,"If you liked the Mummy, you'll LOVE the Return.",7,4 May 2001,"Few sequels are ever as good as their predecessors, but this one is actually better.  The Mummy Returns with a better story and similar effects and manages to keep the campy attitude, accidental humor and adventure of the original. Great fun!",The Mummy Returns
418,Dengar,One of the worst films ever!,2,6 May 2001,"If you were unpleased with the first one, do NOT go see this sequel in hopes of seeing an improvement over everything that bogged that one down. If you disliked the original, all of the things you hated and more will be there to terrorize you. There are SO many elements wrong with this film I could write a book on it, and just may someday provided I could ever sit through it again. The CGI animation is the least of the problems, but that in itself is so wretchedly done that you will either laugh out loud because it is so fake, or else get really annoyed beyond compare. There is a part where I actually wanted the young boy to go outside the temple rather than stay inside trying to revive his dead mother, just so he could be entertained by the cartoon show outside (an army of hundreds of thousands of cartoon jackals line up for battle). If you enjoy a movie that blatantly rips off Home Alone reactions, Titanic embraces on the stern of a ship, a vehicle that flies past the moon ala E.T., or a character dressed in the exact same costume Tom Cruise wore in the orgy scene of Eyes Wide Shut, then go see this movie!! Otherwise be prepared to witness a great travesty. Just think...all the money used to make this ""movie"" could have been used to feed and clothe hundreds of thousands of starving children.",The Mummy Returns
419,Cheerful_Dragon,Not very original!,5,22 July 2001,"I'm always wary of films where I can pick holes early on, and I was right to be wary of this one.  I saw 'The Mummy' and enjoyed it, even though it was horribly inaccurate about Egypt (ancient and modern).  This film just took 'The Mummy' and did it over again.  Many of the special effects, although exciting, had been used in the first film.  It's as if the production team decided to use them over again to save money.  The dialogue was sometimes unintentionally funny, the acting was mediocre at best and there didn't seem to be an original idea in the whole film.  Not a film I'll be adding to my video collection when it comes out!",The Mummy Returns

I was exhausted before the commercials (no, not the trailers, thecommercials BEFORE the trailers) were over. Your average video game provides more thrills and potential forfree thought.

421,marsman,Let's see how many Indiana Jones rip-offs can be put on film,6,10 May 2001,"Look, this film had some entertaining moments, however, there were NO surprises.  I think almost every minute of this film was borrowed from somewhere else.  If it wasn't from the entire Indiana Jones trilogy it was Army of Darkness or James Bond or the Matrix or Final Fantasy (video game). Despite the fast pace and attempts at action, I was distracted by all the scenes and elements I recognized from other places.  Hollywood at its most unoriginal trying to pass off the same old thing refurbished.  Nothing special.  6/10",The Mummy Returns
422,edluvsday,The Mummy Returns...... without a plot or suspense! ! !,2,8 May 2001,"This movie is completely awful. With a throw together plot and computer cut out effects... wait was this the Phantom Menace??  It seems that the studio executives decided that they would use the tried and true sequel success formula.....add a child actor ( It ""worked"" for Jurassic Park II ).....put the characters in the exact same situations as the first film....Jonathan pretends to be a zombie in the first movie so lets have him pretend to be a pigmie in the sequel. In the first one the mummy creates a giant sandstorm in which his face appears so this time lets have a giant wave where his face appears. I guess the studio thought that the similarities would be to subtle for the public to recognize. There was more excitement in the first ten minutes of Spy Kids than in the entire 2+ hours of this dredge. Save your money !",The Mummy Returns
423,scharms,This movie is quite bad.,2,25 April 2002,"No, let me re-state that, this movie is terrible. It was very disappointing, because I liked the first one a lot. It has very little in common with the first one. The kid is extremely annoying, and in no way acts like a kid would act in real life, completely stupid. There is no suspense, the action is way over the top and totally unbelievable. There are so many implausible plot elements and ludicrous things happening it was hard to keep track of them all.I started to roll my eyes after about 15 minutes into the film. I wanted to stop watching, but for some reason sat through the rest of the torture. The only thing decent about the film was the scenery, which kept it from getting a ""1"" rating.",The Mummy Returns
424,uncleseven,For those who didn't like the first...,7,5 May 2001,"Quick and simple.The Mummy 1999 - Bad scarab effects(and overused), bad acting (especially the female lead), annoying supporting acting, and a movie that was confused at times if it wanted to be serious or just fun.The Mummy Returns 2001 - Cameo use of scarabs (darker and higher quality work), the lead actress learned how to act between films, the supporting cast did a much better job, and the movie was just overall more fun than the first.  Oh yeah, the fight choreography was much better also.Don't get me wrong, the sequel had it's problems also (nobody has been able to properly CG a human face yet, but ILM gives a good shot at it here)What makes the difference between the two films is that the first allowed its problems to detract from it's overall quality, while the second has problems that just add to the ""popcorn action film"" feel.",The Mummy Returns
425,Boojoe,Not as good as the first one.,5,5 May 2001,"*********SPOILERS***********
While this movie is enjoyable, it is no where near as good as the first one. First of all, The Mummy doesn't seem as powerful or as intimidating as he does in the first one.  Then they come up with all this stuff about Brendan Fraser being a warrior of god because he has a tattoo that he didn't have in the first one.  And now Rachel Weisz is the reincarnation of the Pharaoh's daughter and knows how to fight and can navigate pyramids, which she couldn't do in the first one.  The whole movie builds to the showdown with the Scorpion King who turns out to be a big cartoonish monster.Still, this movie has good scenes.  The war scenes with Anubus' army, the sai fighting with Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez, and the fight between Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo.If you enjoyed the first one, this is worth seeing in the theater because of the special effects.",The Mummy Returns
426,xzis10s,"I've seen this movie, it was called ""The Mummy.""",7,16 May 2001,"First, let me say, I really enjoyed the first ""The Mummy.""  ""The Mummy Returns"" is almost as good.  I knock it a bit for being too much like the first one in some spots, but not similar enough in the places it counts. Strangely enough I believe this was deliberate on the part of the director, but whatcha gonna do?  The primary thing I noticed is this movie takes itself even less seriously than the first.  It has an almost cartoon-like quality in certain spots which really threw me for a loop.  However, it's still a fun time film that you really couldn't ask more of.  Thank god ""The Rock"" had such a tiny role.  Watch for ""The Scorpion King"" prequel scheduled to come out 2002.  7 out of 10",The Mummy Returns
427,Cthulhu Spawn,I only regret that one is the lowest rating,1,4 May 2001,"This movie hurt me in a way that I have never been hurt before.  I feel it was the worst movie that I have ever seen in a theatre....The Mummy Returns is a non-stop thrill ride of plot holes, superficial acting, poorly done special effects, and scenic rip-offs of well known movies.  Only one other movie I have seen drove me to the point of screaming while I watched it, I was overcome with a desire to warn others that they should not see this film.While I sat in the theatre, I was wistfully remembering horrid films that in comparison outshine this.... this.. ugh, words fail to describe this monstrousity.  I remember films like: Congo, Ishtar, Howard the Duck; I found myself thinking about how much fun I'd be having if these films were on the screen instead of the Mummy 2.  I wished for a power failure, earthquake, hurricaine, anything to stop the pain that was throbbing behind my eyes.I won't spoil the storyline, mainly because I felt the movie lacked one...maybe there is a rosetta stone buried somewhere in Hollywood that fills in the tattered swiss-cheese plot.  Or maybe the makers of this film are true sadists and have planned a Mummy 3 that will run along the same time frame filling in the holes in Mummy 2.   God, I hope not.My friend I watched the movie with summed it up very well when he said, ""You have to treat movies like this like you would treat a bear attack... Just try to go limp, hope you survive, and try to cover up your genitalia.""I'll conclude with a plea to anyone who is listening, don't go see this movie, if you waste the price of admission on this terrible movie, you'll likely never forgive yourself.",The Mummy Returns
428,Kool_Beanz,TERRIBLE sequel and a TERRIBLE film period,1,6 May 2001,"The Mummy Returns looked really good before it came out. However I saw it last night and it is a waste of film. I LOVE The Mummy. Sure it might not have been entirely original but it was FUN and it never took itself seriously. Plus Jerry Goldsmith conducted a wonderful score.With this film, it takes itself way too seriously, has a TERRIBLE score(Alan Silvestri sucks!), and it is a ripoff of the Indiana Jones Trilogy(whoever thinks Brendan Fraser-while a cool guy-is better than Indiana Jones is insane), The Matrix, and The Lost World. The little pygmy warriors serve absolutely no point in this dreck. They pluck people down and attack them EXACTLY like the Velociraptors did in The Lost World. Rick O'Connell fights Imhotep with some Matrix-ish moves and The Scorpion King( this guy is only in the film for less than five minutes!) throws enemies to the ground in the style of The Matrix.The CGI is an embarassment. ILM has done GREAT work on so many other films, and they did a totally horrible job on this. When the giant scorpion with the Rock's head appeared at the end, I laughed myself silly at it's hokiness, as did many others in the packed theater. Either Stephen Sommers wanted to pay homage to Ray Harryhausen or he just wanted to do a rush job and that much is clear through the whole film. If he had another year(all sequels should at least have three years inbetween them) to work on this, he could have refined the CGI and plot so much more. Yes this is a popcorn movie and it was never intended to be Shakespeare but The Mummy had decent acting, great CGI, and a coherent plot. The Mummy Returns has none of these things.I highly advise anyone who has not seen this film to not see it. It is a dissapointment and a waste of money.The Mummy RULESThe Mummy Returns SUCKS",The Mummy Returns
429,cimerians,Stupid but fun to watch,2,23 May 2001,"Boring, cliche etc. and a major rip-off of Indiana Jones makes me hate this movie but part of me enjoyed it especially the great action scenes. Its predictable and corny but if you need some of this type of thing then go see it. Also, you MUST watch the first Mummy to enjoy this.....otherwise its a pretty brainless film.",The Mummy Returns
430,kaelnin-1,Not as good as the original,7,11 May 2001,"This movie, while not bad, was nowhere near as exciting and entertaining as the original film. I found the heavy reliance on digital special effects, a staple now in Hollywood, to detract from the heart and spirit of the original picture, which used them liberally as well (but not nearly as much as here). The characters were the same, but they did not seem to be having the same feel to the them as they did in the first movie. The film's nature was darker as well, not as tongue-in-cheek as the first picture. The reason I liked the Mummy so much was its blend of high-octane action, great stuntwork, good special effects, and a light touch of comedy. Here everything is CGI special effects in overdrive, much in the same vein as the Jurassic Park films. Also, the darker nature of the film made it seem less interesting than the first one did. Once again, I point out that it wasn't all bad. Some of the new characters were very interesting, and some of the returning ones had their moments, but this film will not go down in my books as an instant classic, like the first one did.",The Mummy Returns
431,coolkev,Really good!,8,16 July 2001,I really like this movie. The scenes with The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) were truly good at the start of the movie. Good special effects. Can't wait for Scorpion King next spring!!! The Rock will lay the SMACKDOWN!!!!!!!!!! Brendan Fraser as always made a good effort for this movie!,The Mummy Returns
432,nuwan_wel,Man..why are people so unkind,8,24 April 2008,"I love commenting on shows that generate such diversity of opinions. There are many people who seemed to love the Mummy Returns and an equal if not more hated it! To me I think those who hated it (i.e gave it 1 or 2 out of 10) often fail to see what the show was really intended for and go down to the technicalities of it all..That is was the script good, were the special effects serviceable, were the characters well presented. All of these areas are important but they pale into insignificance when all the show is there for is to entertain.Now lets face it...this would not and did not win Oscars at the year of its release so if you want an Oscar worthy movie watch Gladiator or Titanic. But if you want a movie where you can check your brain at the door and enjoy a rollicking good old fashioned action adventure yarn then this is it.The Mummy Returns can be summed up in two words....Bigger, Better. Everything is on a grander scale compared with the first one. More action, bigger threat and a larger scope. For Hollywood sequels that's what they do in action sequels...look at Xmen 2, Empire Strikes Back, Spiderman etc.The action is non-stop and has some great skin of your teeth type moments which are similar to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg movies based on the 1930's republic serials. The characters have changed notably Rachel Weisz's character but remember this is set 9 years after the original so this is believable. The son also is believable to a certain point as he would be influenced by his parents and the relationship he shares with his father is very touching.Imhotep has definitely been humanised and he turns out to be the sympathetic bad guy. The bad guys are all good except the Rock. he is very one-dimensional in this but then he didn't get much screen time.Overall I thought the movie was good. Look at what it is for what it is...just a goofy action movie that was purely made to entertain and try not to read into it too much.Just enjoy!!!",The Mummy Returns
433,auslander11,Horrible.,2,24 May 2009,"There is no excuse for this. This was, literally, the worst big-budget movie in 2001.I won't disagree with the 'cartoony' feel of the thing. If that's the way you want to go with it - you want to take a classic horror movie and turn it into something horrific because it'll get the little kids to drag mommy and daddy in, then that's fine. You bought the rights, have at it. And it's even possible to enjoy someone raping cinema history as Sommers did here, I'm sure, if it's done well.This wasn't.I'll just give you two examples. Please bear in mind that these are merely examples, they are by no means 'the only two problems with the movie' but they are two of the biggest.First of all Alex is left in Lock-Nah's care. Here is a gentleman who has survived in some of the harshest environments in the world, and in this movie we're to believe that he'll just grudgingly do whatever Alex tells him because he can't murder the kid. You have taken suspension of disbelief too far. As an audience member I wanted to pin his hand to a table with a knife and tell him that if he needed a drink to pee his pants and suck the moisture out of the fabric, because he's not going anywhere. But we're to believe that a man who lives in areas where people would sooner kill you just for thinking you're a thief than bother to call the authorities would just groan and do as he's told by this brat. No dice, Sommers, you moron.Secondly (and this is just an even worse version of something that happened in the first one, actually) at the end, when verses need to be spoken to perform 'magic', huge conversations are carried on in the midst of it. ""Magic magic magic . . . hey, how do I say this? Yeah, this right here! Are you sure? Oh, yeah, that's it! Alright, thanks! Hey, how're things going? Doing well? Awesome, awesome. Well, I'd better get on with saving the world from hordes of the undead! Yeah, I know, every summer, right?! Ha! Anyway . . . magic magic magic."" By Sommers' logic, we should all be casting magic spells every day, because at some point, you're going to have uttered all the syllables in the right order. Just more poorly-thought-out crap that anyone with an IQ over 80 could spot the hole in with about 2 1/2 seconds of thought, but Sommers has so little respect for his audience that he just tosses it in there so that he can build tension.In other words: Sommers wanted a visual spectacle to be delivered, and he did so. He wanted mummies in there, and there were. He wanted Brendan Frasier, and there is. He wanted Egyptian women trained in and fighting with Asian weapons (in ancient Egypt) and for some reason, there are. He wanted a ""precocious"" child (read: freaking insufferable little turd begging to be thrown from a plane, sans parachute) and he got one. What Sommers did not give a crap about was a coherent setting that's consistent with itself, much less the real world. Because Sommers clearly has the intelligence of a dung beetle, and expects you to as well.",The Mummy Returns
434,cutefriskyturtle,Why the high rating?,2,21 July 2012,"So, where do start Oh geez..Im not going to review the plot you should know that by now. It's...bad. Not just bad,horrible. I would not recommend this to ANYONE. In fact, I made an account because of how bad it was. When I saw the high rating I thought..Did I miss something? The acting is HORRIBE. Oh my god, it's so bad. So so bad. The soundtrack was horrible, stupid and just boring I don't know, everything was bad. It was so cheesy. And had the most predictable cliché moments ever. The serious moments were beyond laughable. I swear it was a soap opera. Now I didn't rate it a 0 because well, The effects..Are okay..

I was wrong.The story and the script for the movie is excellent, and the characters are wonderful as well. The worst part of the movie are all the animations. They are neither realistic nor timed at all, just a big pain in the backside. And annoying, which lowered my vote from an 8 to 4.The DVD-release of the movie is not better. The cover tell you about all the extra-material and such, but when you launch the extra material in the extra annoying and slow interface, all you get is: ""You need a computer with Windows and a DVD-drive to use the extra-materials"".Am I going to buy another DVD just to check out the bonus materials?Not likely. This lowered my vote from 4 to 3.Conclusion: Avoid this movie. Perhaps you can use it as a sleeping pill.",The Mummy Returns
436,hello-nature,This movie should be wrapped in bandages ....,1,14 May 2001,"This is the worst movie I have seen in some time.  My excuse for going to see it is I didn't see the first one.   I rarely get itchy feet while at a movie but 15 minutes into this one I started wondering how long it was going to be.  There is no character development.This movie certainly proves that special effects don't make a movie. The effects were great but when you don't have a connection, its like watching something cool for a few minutes then its time to leave.  The characters are all artificial, superficial, two dimensional things that don't behave in any way approaching a normal person.  The man and woman are either in gut wrenching danger or kissing.  And even the kissing was boring since there is no build up - its like, ok, can we have a kiss - camera, action - its a take.  Yawn!!!!",The Mummy Returns

438,yeehawjct,Yay! Just Plain FUN!,9,14 May 2001,"I didn't see ""The Mummy"" at the theater.  I only saw it on DVD after Christmas, and I loved it.I was afraid ""The Mummy Returns"" would be disappointing, as sequels so often are, and then I heard Ebert and Roeper both panned it, while they love ""A Knight's Tale"" (the trailers of which set my teeth on edge.)  So, I was really leery when I went into the theater.I LOVED it.  So Izzy's accent was too cultured for his character?  His character was building dirigibles in the middle of nowhere.  Gee, he must have been someplace civilized.  So Evie is a little more buxom?  It's now the 1930s and she's almost ten years older.  So why was the curator working for Imhotep?  Try power and the anticipation of helping Imhotep run the world.  You need to have that spelled out for you?  Evie's fighting abilities are explained in the plot.  Jonathan may be a cad, but he comes through in the clutch (and he HAS made the adventures profitable for our heroes, both times.)I have a degree in anthropology.  When I was a kid, I read everything I could on ancient Egypt and I still keep up on it.  (I remember reading a passage on how to embalm a mummy to my mother at the lunch table.) But I still can appreciate Fantasy Ancient Egypt.  I'll put this movie's Eqyptian scenes up to both ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""The Egyptian.""  It's light years beyond ""Land of the Pharoahs"" - and Patrician Velazguez sure has Joan Collins beat.Any of you read the Amelia Peabody series of books by Elizabeth Peters?  I think Rick, Evie and their son bear a passing resemblance to Emerson, Amelia and their son, Ramses.  No plagiarism, but I think someone with a hand in the script has read those books, too.There was a British film company from the 1930s-40s that started their films with a man striking a big gong.  Can't remember the company name, but somebody in the production of this movie sure did.I will admit that the Scorpion King looked like he escaped from the ""Screk"" trailer.So, all of you people agonizing about plot and character and lighting and nuance and what they had on the set for lunch, go make comments on ""Shadow of the Vampire"" and let the rest of us enjoy ourselves.",The Mummy Returns
439,jynnantonnix,check the demographics,8,8 May 2001,"First off, I did enjoy this film immensely, as I did the original.Obviously, neither is deathless cinema, and while the original had maybe a bit more innocence and charm, this one makes up for it with a certain depth. Problem is that it gets lost in all the special effects... Let me get to my main point, though, which was something I arrived at in reading the demographics on the votes. Almost every ""real"" review I have seen of this film makes a point of it being geared towards adolescent males, and this is where the surprise lies. Because across the board, this film is favored by women...and not necessarily the younger ones. Until I noted those figures, I thought I might be alone, but just let me speak for a moment to any of those ladies out there who might be wondering if this is something they might enjoy...Yes, it is too loud. Yes, it has way too many computer generated action sequences. Yes, there are gaping holes in the plot... But it's fun. It's a great movie to watch with the kids, and also one to enjoy alone. There's romance of both the worldly and otherworldly variety.There's a movie kid who is actually appealing.For those who like him, there's Brendan Fraser at his swashbuckling best.There are strong female characters(though I personally thought Anck-su-Namun turned out to be a real B****) It has some captivating eye candy in the shape of Oded Fehr, and last but by no means least, the writhe-in-your-seat-sexy Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep.

I am both a big Brendan Fraser fan and a huge fan of mummy movies of all sorts.  This has to be my favorite movie in both of those categories. While the original is still one of my favorite movies, the mummy returns has both better plot and character development.  The effects were awesome, the music is better than the original.  I think the little kid is adorible, and i like the way that they developed the charactor of Evelyn and also the transformation of Rick into the family man.  I think that this is a great movie and a must see film.",The Mummy Returns
441,philomise-2,awesome opener for the summer season,9,7 May 2001,"I gave this one a nine based solely on the fact that it's probably the first summer blockbuster to come out this holiday season (well, I consider summer movies a holiday season. . . I don't know about you).  It does suffer from ""sequel-itis"" to some extent, but that's not a problem when you look at all the awesome special effects, hilarious comedy, and excellent fight sequences.Sure, it lacks the suspense it seems to be going for and many of the plot turns are simply stupid, but anyone should be able to tell that this 21st century rendition of the classic story of ""The Mummy"" is one that comes with a lot of farce.  I liked being able to predict certain things because it made me feel so comfortable that I didn't expect the other things coming. And sure, some of the stuff was so stupid that you had to slap your forehead and shake your head in disdain, but do you think that Stephen Sommers made this film with the intent of winning an Oscar or something?  Maybe making a buttload of money yes, but you've gotta give some credits to the sell-outs out there who can make money and be extremely entertaining at the same time!I thought that the whole thing had this sort of old-fashioned style to it, like an old serial from the thirties, i.e. Captain Marvel or Batman.  It was kind of like this really cool western that utilized some really funny cliches that nobody's seen for a while.  Specifically, I think I'm talking about some of the scenes involving the Magi.  Then there were other scenes that were a lot like Star Wars Episode 1 when JarJar's people are fighting the droids.  This film just came together to use a lot of old techniques and themes that work really well and kept me entertained throughout.It's a great starter for the summer season.  Makes me feel more optimistic about what's to come, probably because all the awesome trailers that came before the feature.  Anyway, this is definitely worth your money even if the little kid in it can be a little annoying and the plot wraps around you like a badly weaved afghan with a thousand huge holes in it!",The Mummy Returns

The new Freddie Boath is very delightful in this Mummy thriller.  This Adventure-Horror film is a show for the whole family that includes a few jokes that will have you laughing out of your seat.

446,bluestreak5,Special effects were good; the plot was not,3,6 May 2001,"If you like to see state-of-the-art 21st-century special effects injected into a farcical plot with poorly written dialogue, then The Mummy Returns might be just the movie for you.  The special effects saved this movie from a disaster worse than the one the characters in the film face.  As in the first installment of The Mummy back in 1999, The Mummy Returns packs a punch with a lot of exciting special effects.  However, that is where the similarity ends.  Whereas The Mummy had some semblance of a plot, the plot of The Mummy Returns is used like a clothesline to display the special effects.  The entire concept is far-fetched: ""We didn't learn our lesson last time when we unleashed the most dangerous mummy of all-time.  Why don't we unleash one that is even more dangerous that we conveniently forgot to mention in the first movie?""  In addition, we see characters appearing, going places, and doing things that have no logical explanation for them. As bad as the plot was, it looked like Shakespeare compared to the dialogue, which appears to have been written by a 7-year old watching Saturday morning cartoons.   A sample: ""I really hate mummies.""  Wow, what insight into the character's mind!  This movie would make excellent fodder for a future Mystery Science Theater 3000 show. Here's my recommendation: if you want to see a lot of amazing special effects with little else, go see The Mummy Returns.  If you want to laugh at a completely incomprehensible plot and crude dialogue, go see The Mummy Returns.  This movie is a 3 at best.",The Mummy Returns

I wasn't a huge fan of the first one so although the trailers looked good I was in no desperate desire to see this sequal.But I am so glad I did, it is most definately a big screen extravanganza, I'm not so sure how well it will look when it reaches the DVD/Video market.The jokes are funny, the plot is interesting, the characters are interesting and amusing but never annoying. You even end up liking the kid, and how often does that happen.I walked out wanting to see it again, and I'm sure others will feel the same.",The Mummy Returns
448,bobniche,Entertaining Rehash,7,25 May 2001,"Well the Mummy Returns is exactly that. Entertaining no doubt but ever so similar to the first film. The returning cast return playing exactly the same characters with some extra 'revelations' casually thrown in. As a pure entertainment it isn't bad at all. However much was brought over from the first film you wonder where all the good ideas have gone (the special effects?). The Scorpion King was good but was ultimately superficial but the O'Connell offspring was a tad irritating. Everything else is frighteningly samey, even certain plot devices were recycled. Once again we are treated to Imhotep's face chasing our heroes and we get another oddball pilot.Of note is the substantial amount of visual effects the viewer is assaulted with. Some were great (the oasis) but some were rather disappointing (the Scorpion King) but as a whole they worked well and gave a film a nice sheen.All in all rather fun but nothing new. People who watched the first film will know what to expect. Just leave your brain at home, sit back and enjoy. I give this a 7.",The Mummy Returns
449,gmarlow,Average at best,6,11 June 2001,"This film is basically the first one repeated again, so if you liked the first one you will love this. I found it better than i expected it was a surprisingly funny action adventure and the effects on the whole were good, however i would have to agree with comments some of the reviewers made about the effects at the end, it really did look like they ran out of money the effects were surprisingly lame I haven't seen such bad effects since The Phantom Menace!",The Mummy Returns
450,heybrakywacky,"Not surprisingly, this falls short of the first movie.",5,18 July 2001,"Unfortunately, this movie was what I expected it to be, going into it.  Like The Mummy, this movie has really great special effects.  But what it lacks is the quirkiness, campiness, character interplay, and overall energy that the first movie has.The Mummy Returns, like its predecessor, has the theme of grave danger to the world in the awakening of an immortal, evil power.  But this time, the evil power is that of the Scorpion King, and at his command, the evil army of Anubis.  Whosoever can best the Scorpion King in battle will gain control of his armies, and subsequently world domination.But that's the problem here.  We have this all-powerful enemy with his armies to contend with.  In addition, there is the evil group of people who resurrect high priest Imhotep, with the idea that he will defeat the Scorpion King and thus take over the world.  And intertwined through the whole mess is our band of heroes, who are consigned to thwarting these efforts, but who throughout the movie seem merely resigned to do so, without any of the sense of urgency that should surround such an undertaking. Indeed, Brendan Frasier's character makes a couple of comments to that effect: ""You know, a year ago, this would have completely freaked me out."" In this installment, the villains don't really seem all that immortal or all-powerful.  In spite of whatever powers they may wield, they're presented as not much more than another enemy to thwart.  It doesn't help that Imhotep is presented as being in collusion with all of these ""mortals.""  Come on! In the first movie, we get this presentation of Imhotep as this all-powerful force to be reckoned with, someone who has no need of conspiring with other individuals to get what he wants.  He is far too mortalized here.In addition, the character interplay just doesn't have the dynamic that it does in the first movie.  Frasier and Weisz's characters just don't have the excitement and energy that they have in the first movie.  John Hannah is very funny, as he is in the first installment, and as such is a redemption to the movie.  But the part of comic relief in such a movie is supposed to be just that: a relief from the tension and excitement of the rest of the film.  Unfortunately, that just doesn't exist here.And that's the fatal flaw of this movie.  It violated premises that it could ill afford to violate, in that it was boring and lacking in anticipation. There were moments that were obviously meant to suprise, catch you off guard.  Unfortunately, you could see them coming a mile away.  In addition, the characters were as uninspired as the plot, and as such all the special effects in the world couldn't save it.  The ""here we go again"" mentality of the film could have stood up, if the film itself were not so derivative of the first film, and at the same time lacking in any innovation to make it distinct.I give it 5 out of 10 stars.  It can be a somewhat entertaining watch, but it doesn't hold a candle to the first film.",The Mummy Returns

But when I caught this on cable again the other night, I was asking myself all over again how such a loud, annoying, pointless mess could have sold so many tickets? Interesting that the third Mummy movie has taken more than seven years to get off the ground, I think perhaps the studio (or maybe even the filmmakers) knew that audiences would need years to forget how bad the first two in the series were before plunking their money down again. I'm ALMOST glad I caught this on TV, because I will definitely remember how bad these films are next summer and NOT be seeing Mummy 3, no matter how much marketing they hit us with.",The Mummy Returns

The kid does to this movie what Jar Jar Binks did to 'Phantom Menace'.  The special effects in the final fight scene were awful; the Scorpion King looked like a cartoon.  Overall not a ""bad"" movie, just not a ""good"" movie either. The homage to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" at the beginning was appreciated.",The Mummy Returns

457,inkhorn5,Toilet Paper,2,5 May 2001,"This movie was god-awful. With a budget of a hundred million dollars one would think that there would be enough to hire a decent team of writers. Judging by the way the story is told in the Mummy Returns it was just made up as they went along.  I realize that its an adventure movie and should be watched as such but without solid believable characters to hold it up, the unbelievable story crumbles to pieces. Indiana Jones was in some pretty ridiculous situations as well but the writing was good and we believed those situations.  The Mummy Returns is another example of the unfortunate actions of Hollywood. ""Who cares if its good it'll make a fortune anyway"" So if your thinking of going to see this movie go outside set down your eight bucks in the middle of the road and set a fire with it. The few minutes of watching the money crackle and burn is a greater investment of your time.",The Mummy Returns

Well, this movie takes you right back there! All your favourites are back. And now there is a new one: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Beware however that while the finale pretty predictable, it will still have you on the edge of your seat. The F/X are even better than the first movie. Though if you are looking for integrity in the Egyptology, you should go to college, not be watching movies. The chase scene through London is fabulous, and Freddy Boath is great as Rachel & Brendan's son. And the Egyptian ""ancient martial arts"" cat fight between the Princess and the pharoah's fiance leaves little to the imagination. I am just a little tired of every movie seeming to require a martial artist these days.",The Mummy Returns

I cannot say the same of the sequel.First of all, it lost its originality. Not only is it ""inspired"" by the first film, it plagiarize entire parts of it (the kids who destroys all the temple's pillars as his mother did with the library in the first installment, the huge face of Imothep in the water trying to swallow our heroes hot air balloon compared to the same face in the sandstorm trying to swallow the light airplane).Then, there are those other movie influences: A final battle between the heroes and the arch-enemies while outside, good troops are fighting with an army so much more powerful (Did I hear someone say Star Wars?). Women fighting with various bladed weapons and running on walls (Why did I think of Crouching Tiger?) A perfectly swell gentleman turning to be the leader of a cult which our heroes spy from above(Have you seen Indianna Jones and the Temple of Doom?)Otherwise, the story have been left out and it's just action scene over action scene with a couple of in jokes to lighten up the atmosphere and remind us of how ""the mummy"" was so much more better than this dumb sequel.
By the way, could anyone tell me how ""The Rock"" got his name in top billing when he only appears on screen for a couple of minutes.",The Mummy Returns

Rachel Weisz is sexy and magnificent, Brendan Fraser the perfect likeable action hero.

Everything that is supposed to be a surprise can be seen coming too far off. I hate to ruin a movie for anybody, but trust me, you will know a major piece of how the movie will end in the first 30 minutes. It is practically waved under your nose. I think the people making this movie relied a little too heavily on our ability to suspend disbelief as well. Okay, I expect to have to just go along with several story devices in a movie like this, but don't push me too far. I can accept mummies that use martial arts (after all, I have to accept the whole Imhotep thing to even buy a ticket.) However, asking me to accept that a trip from London to Cairo only took two days in 1933 is too much.(Yes, I know that planes existed, but how do you transport the creature and his entire entourage so fast? It seems far more likely that trains and boats would be involved.) I am then asked to accept a rocket powered dirigible! And then this last device is stretched far beyond the breaking point.

464,Fletch F. Fletch,I would rather have an aneurism...,1,4 May 2001,"The Mummy Returns was possibly the most inconstitent movie I have ever seen. There were at least twenty times during the movie where the plot completely fell to pieces and the viewer was left so totally confused that there was nothing else to do but get lost in the incessant wave of visual effects, which were no where near as impressive as the previews made out.  I can't even begin to describe the plot holes that so confounded me with their stupidity that it made Independence Day look like a screenplay masterpiece worthy of Oscar recognition.  Of course, Brandon Fraiser was as wooden as ever, the British girl (whatever her name his) is just as annoying as every movie she has been in, the kid is ridiculous, and all the other characters don't even have enough personality between them to pull off the Olson twins on Full House.  Simply put, I'm so dumb struck by the sheer monstrosity this 'film' represents that I would prefer to watch every episode of Step by Step and Family Matters back to back before I would sit through that utter maggot-ridden garbage born from Satan's bowels.

465,beckerbuns,"Take it at face value, folks",7,26 May 2001,"Well, the first thing I noticed, within the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, was the plot of this movie being very convoluted and a strong suspension of disbelief being required.  There are also a whole lot of handy coincidences and characters saying ""I remember this guy"" or ""Not this, again!"" which gets real old after a while.There is also a smart alec kid who could get on your nerves, even if you're trying really hard to like him.The movie is also rated PG-13 this time around and so there is a lot less gore and it's not nearly as scary as the first one.  Which sucks.The Rock was really okay (quite out of character actually) and as usual Brendan Fraser is yummy and his costars are competent.So it was a good flick as far as the action and special effects and all, but it's pretty hard to follow unless you're paying really close attention.

466,NOSbooster,The Mummy Returns Better than the first...,9,2 August 2001,"Well, I didn't think it was possible, but the sequel to the blockbuster smash ""The Mummy"" was even better than its predecessor. It even opened up new ideas for more sequels and prequels! The Mummy Returns features ""The Scorpion King"" who was the greatest worrier of his time.  After he died he was said to rise 5000 years later and rule the world with his army.  The movie starts in the 1930s, hence the year of the Scorpion King.  So a bunch of guys(including the reincarnated Anck-Su-Namun, Decide to bring back Im-Ho-Tep to fight the scorpion king and when he does, he will take command of his army and rule the world. ( It's always that ""Take-Over-The-World ploy"") Well as you guessed Rick O'Connell and his wife Evelyn 'Evie' O'Connell, have different plans.   They set out with their son, Evie's brother, and one of the leaders of the Majai ""Ardeth Bay"", to stop the evil Mummy as well as the Scorpion King.  There are lots and lots of plot twists, and awesome graphics!  One thing you had in this Mummy that you didn't in the one before is the relationship between Rick and Evie. In the first one they hated each other and it made for some good humor watching these two duke it out while working together. However, their young son, and Evie's Brother have great roles..and portray them perfectly.  The thing I really liked is the way Alex (Rick and Evie's son) is so bold that he stand up to the main bad guy and basically puts him through hell. He even tells the Mummy himself ""My Dad Is Going To Kick Your..."" (Lets not finish that) it's funnier when you see the little kid do it anyway. This was an all-around great movie. The only thing that bothered me was how they stated that ""Reincarnation"" is a fact, and the way they ""Summoned"" the dead. All pretty demonic.

468,Ashekenaz,"No Plot, Just A Wild, Wild Ride",10,2 June 2001,"****Spoilers Contained Herein****First off, here's the disclaimer. This movie has no plot whatsoever,nought, nowt, not a lot. Zilch, thats the Big O. If you like your movies to hang together and have deep, complex and meaningfulplots, and don't like it any other way, then you may as well go and get out a video, because you will utterly loathe the Mummy Returns.If however, you enjoy a good, fun film, to be watched with brain switched off, bucket of popcorn, and several mates, and you like a good laugh, then this is for you.This is a Wild, Wild ride. This is Indiana Jones written large, with more humour and a few twists. This is the 1930's equivalent of Steampunk, with the rocket-airship and all the gun-play, as well as all the magic and mayhem that goes on. It's a fascinating kind of style really,and one which I'd like to see movies use in the future (albeit maybe with more plot :@) ).So, right from the first scenes, where they find the bracelet, you realise this sequel is going to at once pay homage to its predecessor, and send you out on some new thrills along the way. You know how it works. Find artefact, make bad quote, accidently unleash ancient evil, race against time to fix it. The Kid is funny, he just has this habit of being incredibly sarcastic at the most inappropriate moments, which is hilarious when you see the reactions he gets. Brendan has made this style his own, and he does the hero schtick very well, fighting, shooting, quipping and complaining his way through the film. Rachel gets to kick ass some more in this film. Lara Croft has nothing on this girl, lets be honest (its the tight black that does it for me). John Hannah plays Jonathan with that usual bumbling Englishness that he did so well in the first film. Arnold Vosloo is as scary as all hell as Imhotep, although I would have liked to have seen some of his other powers. The other players turn in excellent and amusing performances too. The Rock even gets to do his famous eyebrow!The whole film is just one huge, fun, wild romp through fantasyland from beginning to end. I even liked the music, and the Live song at the end of the credits (Forever may not be long enough) was a good counterpoint to the rest of the film.I thoroughly enjoyed this.

We get no explaination for the son that is suddenly in the picture, or the mansion that they seemed to have stocked with every archeology piece known to man. All we get is some handwaving - ""look at our cool mummies!""  We even get a huge computer animated scorpion king, which really looks plastic and inferior to the animation from Spawn, which predates this movie by at least four years.The closing action, and the view into the human side of Imhotep, as well as the very nice background for his origin are what save this movie.Probably best watched after you re-watch the Mummy.",The Mummy Returns

477,PJCRepair,Good start... Bad finish,2,6 February 2002,"I have to say that I really like the first installment of The Mummy. It was so good that it, along with future sequals, could have easily taken up ranks of a new classic with the Indiana Jones series. So knowing this, I was very excited to see this movie. All the way into the theater I was excited by what would happen, and even through a good part of the film I was really liking it. It wasn't as good as the first, but what movie ever is? And I was even willing to accept the WRESTLER (not ACTOR) The Rock in the movie. Note: I am not one for accepting wrestlers in movies, sure they are both entertainment, but one all around sucks (wrestling) and one doesn't (movies). As I have noted to friends before, A wrestler in a movie is equal to a dog and a monkey having a baby. It isn't a good thing even from the start. But then it happened: The team of adventurers went and got into a big (extra fake and cheesy) hot air balloon. Yes that's right kids, they opt out on any logical means of travel for their time period and they get a (extra fake and cheesy) hot air balloon. Ever after I watched the film and only hoped it couldn't get any more unbelieveable. And yet it did! Yes thats right kids, it got worse. The Scorpion King shares his wrath with the audience, not that he is in any way scary it is just that he is so stinking cruddy (Badly computer animated, and even worse as a major bad guy!) Is what I am getting at is that it wasn't the wrestler that made it bad in the end (not that it helped), it was the overly done special effects. The difference between this movie, and the GREAT and AWESOME original is that the original was enhanced by special effects, the face in the sand, the plagues on the cities, even the  computer animated mummies were an addition, and an enhancement, to the already good story and acting. On the contrary in this movie, rather than going with the good characters that were already developed and just adding another plot like Indiana Jones, someone changed the entire theme of the movie from the original and made it special effects. And that doesn't constitute a sequal at all.If you liked The Mummy, don't see The Mummy Returns, it will just spoil the first film, and leave a bad (I just got ripped off 8 bucks) taste in your mouth!",The Mummy Returns
478,sdpapa,Completely unbelievable and I enjoyed EVERY minute of it...,10,5 March 2002,"I wasn't disappointed after having seen The Mummy.  Everybody was yahooing in their seats... which I think was the intention of the film... It had a great sense of humour, but then, Brendon Fraser always carries it off well.It's the kind of film you would enjoy seeing again and again.  Mindless rubbish it may be but we all need a break from reality now and again.  The sets, the costumes, the heroes and antiheroes were all larger than life and literally filled the entire cinema from the big screen.  Brendon was your classical 'sensitive on the inside, I adore my wife, rough round the edges slightly intellectual' hero... basically an oversized little adventurous boy in love... and the people loved him for it.  But, didn't we also sympathise with the mummy in the end also?...  Terrific twist... we didn't expect to show any positive emotions for that nasty number and the Scorpion King whose megalomanias made them hell bent on conquering everything and everyone... I loved the fact that we had 2 villains determined to turn each other to dust before having to deal with our 'cowboy', Rick.  But the real villain was the woman of the Mummy's veeeery long life... Rick's wife showed us one of the positive sides of a woman whereas the other one showed us what absolute bi...... women can be... {I'm a woman and what I said is God's honest truth}. We were cheering in our seats when she finally got what was inevitably coming to her.Take a break from the everyday rat race, give your brain a rest and see this film on video or DVD if you haven't already seen it.  It delivered everything it promised...",The Mummy Returns
479,ausfi,Fun if you do not analyse the improbabilities too much,7,24 August 2013,"I have not seen many movies with so many reviews, 88 pages! Maybe as many liking it as thinking it is boring. I found one guy quite funny, he said the film was ""very good"" and said he'd give it ten out of ten, yet the vote shown was six out of ten! I've seen it a couple of times in the TV, the last time very late at night. I could have watched something else but gave it another go and still found things to enjoy. I think that's because I ignore the improbabilities. I like most of the acting, Brendan Fraser is always good, Rachel Weisz gorgeous and doing fighting scenes well, I find Patricia Velasquez (Anck-Su-Namun) beautiful in very characteristic way. I do not get it why some think Freddy Boath (Alex O'Connell) so annoying, maybe they have no children (?). The character does well not to be intimidated by his captors. I find Arnold Vosloo as the Mummy handsome and an excellent actor. There is even humour in the acting by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the big bad guy. I would like to see more of Obed Fehr (Ardeth Bay), I know he was in the ""Charmed"" but cannot remember his character. John Hannah (Jonathan Carnahan) is always funny, and I liked Shaun Parkes as Izzy.",The Mummy Returns
480,bethmurdock,Much better than the original.,10,31 October 2002,"This sequel really has no equal. The movie tops the original in every way possible, and manages to set the bar even higher for the next installment. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weizs are even more charming here than they were in the original and John Hannah is much better.  Kudos to Freddie Boath who is very cute as Rick and Eve's son, and a special nod goes to Oded Fehr who also gives a great performance . The only problem I had was the Rock, who really does not do much but set himself up for The Scorpion King movie. Other than that, the movie is great. Can't wait for Mummy 3.",The Mummy Returns

I'm an old guy and I remember as a kid in the 50's seeing the 1932 version with Boris Karloff on Nightmare Theater on TV Friday night. It might have been scary, don't remember but it always made me appreciate the whole idea of a mummy. I like The Mummy from 1999 and was excited to see The Mummy Returns with all the originals. I will say that if Dwayne Johnson had stuck around playing the Scorpion King his career would have gone bye-bye. I liked all the actors here and I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay deserves every good role he's had since then. Silly story, great special effects if a little ragged at times but it's still a worthy continuation of the original. Now then, maybe 5 years from now I'll come back again or I might watch The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, although probably not.",The Mummy Returns
483,victorsuk,"Great feel good movie, ......great escapism fun.",10,13 November 2012,"I saw Returns before the first film and at the time of watching Returns at the cinema didn't even realise there was a first one.I have a soft spotfor this film. It has something to do with the atmosphere, music and cinematography of the first 50mins of the film. That is what i remember mostly of this film, it grabs you and doesn't let go. You will love the mansion scene and the bus ride if you are anything like me, and the music that goes with it. This movie is somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me, guilty because i personally don't know anyone who prefers the second one to the first so sometimes im ashamed to say there is a lot to like about Returns.The last third of the film i tend to only vaguely remember to be frank, but i wont downgrade the film for that reason alone, but truthfully i could take or leave some parts of the backend of the film, although i like ancient Egypt so enjoyed those type scenes. There is nothing drastically wrong with the last third, to make me feel i want to downgrade the film, its just the start of the movie stands out for me.Sounds silly, but whenever i feel down for whatever reason i reach for the DVD and watch the first part of the film with nostalgia and it lifts my spirits.",The Mummy Returns
484,milobrandybuck,"Disappointing ending, annoying brat",8,29 November 2004,"Fairly enjoyable film, with good set pieces.Enjoyed the film at cinema, it is only when you watch it at home that some details start to annoy you.The computer graphics of the mummy and his guards were superb as usual, but the ending of the film was let down completely by the seriously ropey looking scorpion king at the end of the movie (didn't look anything like the Rock). What I have to ask is was the budget for cg spent on making the mummies look good, and they ran out of cash to polish the Scorpion King!The MOST annoying thing about the whole movie though was the inclusion of the boy. Within two minutes of him on screen I was rooting for the bad guys when they were going to get rid of him!I rated The Mummy as 10/10, and The Mummy Returns 8/10. (It lost a point each for the Scorpion King graphics, and for the annoying little brat!)",The Mummy Returns

It had its charming elements, and of course the action adventure fun that the first one brought was returned to us again in the sequel. But there were moments I felt I was a little so so about.

486,Tenzin-3,Absolute Drivel,1,13 May 2001,"Overblown effects, protracted, idiotic plot, two-dimensional acting, pathetic ""emoting"" in lieu of any real feeling, ludicrous, uninspired, unbelievable dialogue.For the life of me, I can't fathom how something with effects so big (and obviously expensive) can't have a halfway decent plot and semi-believeable dialogue. It's as if the producers threw 95% of the budget into the effects and 5% into thescreenplay, which seems like an afterthought at best.Talk about wasted talent! Brendan Fraser is a fine comedic actor whose talents are barely tapped in this sophomoric tale of derring-doo doo. Remember those paint by numbers paintings as a kid. This is acting by the numbers. I can just hear the director saying, ""OK, now you've got to look sad here.""Unlike good movies where you tend to get drawn in and involved in the plot and actually begin to care about the characters, I was well aware I was watching a movieÑfinding it exceedingly hard to suspend my disbeliefÑand never developed any empathy whatsoever for any of the characters.I've decided after this film NOT to go see any film just because of the effects. You can have the greatest effects, but if you have a banal plot and insipid dialogue, you have a worthless piece of celluloid.The only niche I could genuinely see enjoying this film are 10-year-old boys who are intrigued and excited by the gee-whiz factor. If you're over 10 and know what plot and characterization are, skip it!",The Mummy Returns
487,bartw,An insult to Indy !,4,5 December 2001,"I've never really managed to watch either of the Mummy films uptill a few days ago, when I decided to give The Mummy Returns a try.I've always liked these kinds of adventure/fantasy/quest kinds of films, and so I expected to have a great time watching it, without really having any high hopes.Well, what a dissapointment it was. It doesn't happen often that I don't even finish watching a movie, but this was just too bad...no fun, no excitement, no tention and no beautiful settings like we've been spoiled with in Indy films.It started all in the very first scene, where this 'Scorpion Warrior' is played by one of the most pathetic actors I've ever seen in such an expensive movie....he's just not convincing....it's just a wrestler or something that is just too idiotic to act a guy that's angry, or almost dying. The moment when he's the only one left in the desert, and falls to the ground from exhaustian is just an insult to any similar film ever made. What a disgrace!And it just goes on like that, although the main actors are very good...not a bad word about them.The scenes that have computer generated backgrounds (so that the actors are playing in front of a blue/green screen) are just as terrible and unfinished looking as in Star Wars Episode I.....when you make something like that you have to be carefull that the light, contrast and colors in your background are the same as in the part where the actors play. It's ofcourse not easy to do these things, but if you're not too experienced don't overdo stuff.The result is that the studio sets are very small and cheap looking, which doesn't give you the idea that they are really there.The film gets even worse because of the childish humour and story, but most of all the directing just completely fails. The guy who directed it doesn't seem to be any good at telling stories....there's no build up to anything, and characters just 'pop' onto the screen....Why do we see a detailed story of 'the mummy' and then suddenly find our 'heroes' in the middle of a quest already ??This film makes all the Indy movies look ever better....I always thought it was a great idea to find him in the middle of a meaningless quest, after which he returns home and then the real story begins...but with a slow build up.No, the scene where they were driving that buss in London almost made it look like it was a parody on Indy.....it could have been done by Mell Brooks.Okay, even a badly made movie can be okay to waste a few hours on a rainy day, but it just wasn't fun.",The Mummy Returns
488,Jen13,Great sequel!,10,2 May 2001,"The CGA is incredible throughout the movie.  Amazing...  until the very end, (you'll know what I mean when you see the movie).  I thought they could've done a better job with it (at the end, of course) and I was kind of disappointed.  I also was quite happy that they didn't deny that it was, in fact, a sequel.  In most sequels, it's either overkill with referrences to the last movie or they try to out do the first one and make little to know referrence at all.  It was cute the way things tied in. Also, you don't necessarily have to see the first Mummy to understand the second. It helps to understand the inside jokes and you might notice the reason for a few things that were in the first one (ex: why Rick wears the leather gauntlet type thing on his arm) -- but it's not really a big deal. This one is all about action, rarely does the scene ever drag.  There's enough going on to keep the audience in their seats for a couple of hours.ONE thing bothered me though, and this is coming from someone who is very observant...  Brendan Fraser's character had an egyptian eye ""tatooed"" between his index finger and his thumb (I forget which hand right now) -- WHERE DID IT GO?  It couldn't have possibly faded in TEN YEARS, could it? That bothered me because I thought that was a really neat place to have a tatoo.  Maybe it was a ""mirage...""?",The Mummy Returns

There was never a boring moment, my eyes were glued to the screen every second. And there was definitly enough eye candy for both sexes!",The Mummy Returns
490,yodergoat,Ugh.,5,5 May 2001,"Since I was a fan of the original, ""The Mummy,""  I made the mistake of expecting the same witty (and oftentimes silly) action story. I should have known better. I don't know who the film-makers are aiming for with this film... it certainly does not seem to be the fans of the original, but rather, their children and to those who came to see the film because they love The Rock. It was to ""The Mummy"" what ""Phantom Menace"" was to the original Star Wars trilogy, a film seemingly made to appeal to young children and to sell action figures. There was _just_ enough clever banter thrown in, as well as some really great fight sequences, to make this acceptable to older viewers, in my opinion. The introduction of yet another smart-aleck 8 year old kid does nothing for me. A child in the story is fine, but this one was just a little over the top. The kids seem to love him, though, even though I imagine that some of the same children laughing at his antics could hardly have sat through and stomached the original movie with its much more adult humor.While some of the original characters are retained, only the personalities of the shifty brother, Jonathan, and the solemn tattooed warrior (I forget the name) are left intact. While I can see that the intention was to show that Rick O'Connell had grown in character to become more responsible as a husband and now as a father, it left him rather dry and boring as compared to the dashing Indiana Jones type which he had been. Quite a change, indeed, and it left me mourning for his previous flair. He was rather convincing as a concerned father and husband though. Evie also underwent a major change, going from a somewhat shy and awkward but entirely convincing bookish young woman with an honest appreciation and enthusiasm for Egyptian history to a scantily clad (is that tight, deep cleavage cut top and heavy black eyeliner _really_ what she wears as her excavation gear?) and completely confident woman. While confidence is nice, and shows the strength of a woman, I did not understand the depth of this change from her former sweet and appealing self... I suppose it is meant to appeal to men. I dunno. Or mayhap it was her ""mysterious dreams"" which instituted the change. She was not very convincing as a mother, either, it seemed. If my husband and I had been through what they had in ""The Mummy,"" I would never leave my curious and foolish young son alone in a tomb whilst I went exploring deeper to find an ancient artifact of great power which I had been dreaming about.... I would know that bad things could arise from such a situation.Imhotep returns in a much less frightening role, at times seeming to be just confused and lost in the story. It seems like he was just included so they could say that the mummy ""returned."" I would much rather have seen the O'Connells battle the Scorpion King rather than have the story muddled by a not very frightening (but handsome) Imhotep. He really didn't add much to the story, and toward the end I was actually liking him as much as I did the main characters, just because he seemed more human and somewhat bumbling. His mistress, once reincarnated, is interesting as a character and pulls off her role well.I was hoping that even if the story was not good, the action and special effects would still make the movie worth watching. True for the fights... they really were awesome and intense. But the special effects? Sigh. Nope! If anything, they pulled it down. The backdrops were fuzzy and too pale (they actually made my eyes hurt), the creatures looked as if they had a few more computer-imaging steps to go through, and the Scorpion King was just plain fake looking. Scary, though. I think that the battle scenes betwixt the army o' Annubis and the Magi were well done, but closeups of the jackal warriors left something lacking. Very smooth and battle-droidy, if you know what I mean. The airship was just silly, silly, silly. Why an airship? Why, oh why? It looked like something off of some made-for-TV adventure movie, and just made me want to giggle. Aside from the effects and characters, the story itself was disjointed and weak. Too many coincidences, too many subplots that amounted to very little, and horribly strained dialog and chase scenes that smacked of being forced. Take out the suddenly rather lame Imhotep, take out the whole reincarnation and ""chosen one"" deal, take out the whole ludicrous airship sequence, and take out most of the pygmy mummies... and perhaps that would have made it worth watching. As it was, I was ready to be done with it not even halfway through the film, and caught myself thinking about other things... my garden, whether or not to go to Wal-Mart after the movie, and so on. Not minding when you need to get up to go to the restroom is not a good sign.I think that the return of the Scorpion King and his legions of minions with their world domination plan would have sufficed for a good story without throwing in all of the riff-raff about Imhotep and past lives. It was simply rambling and long, much like my comments here! This film really semed like it wasn't finished, that there was still some MAJOR editing left to do, and of course the CGI needed to be actually completed rather than seemingly just thrown together for a test run. And the blaring, clanging music was driving me insane with its insistence.... WATCH THE ACTION! BE EXCITED! BE SAD NOW! BE SCARED! BE HAPPY! When the music tries to drive me along like that with its volume and clamor.... argh!!! I am not a fool and can deduce at which times I am supposed to feel a certain emotion without being led along by the hand by overpowering instrumentals.I am very disappointed, and I can honestly say that even if I HADN'T liked or even seen the first movie, I still would not have enjoyed this one.    I gave it 5 stars out of 10. Right up there with Mission to Mars!!!",The Mummy Returns
491,erkirb,Sad waste of time and money,5,14 June 2001,"I usually try to find something positive in a movie but the complete lack of tension in acting and script do not leave much room for that in this case. Even the huge load of effects (in fact they might as well have shot the whole movie in a studio) fail to make impression when the quality starts to decline badly towards the end. The script is so full of clichés that one can shut his eyes in the middle of the film and be sure he won't miss one detail. I think this movie gives a new meaning to those fine Van Damme films that we all love' so much. I can understand the financial arguments behind The Mummy Returns', where there's some easy cash lying around you better grab it, but a major studio should also keep in mind mental health of the poor viewer who might have to sit it through.I propose a minute of silence in memory of those $98m that made the Mummy return",The Mummy Returns

This movie just feels like a old movie. It's too long. There's no history. Just a lot of details that want to make the screenplay sound complex and intelligent. Wrong. The screenplay is horrible. The FX are very, very good. Excluding the end when the Scorpion King appears like he's out of a Nitendo 3D game. Just one more median blockbuster. It ignores the fact that the audience has a brain.

The action continues without ever stopping and totally entertains you in the course of the 130 minutes. Stephen Sommers surpasses himself with each movie he makes and I'm already looking forward to watching `Van Helsing' which is also written AND directed by Sommers. In my opinion his name has to be mentioned at one stroke along with other great action - directors like John McTiernan, John Woo, Renny Harlin, Wolfgang Petersen, Michael Bay and James Cameron.

Producers are using computer graphics instead of on site filming, giving film a bitter, artificial taste.The script also suffered. Like in most modern films, the film lacked personal interaction. More and more fight scenes are used; the script-writers seem to have replaced drama with violence and computer graphics.

In The Mummy Returns they have a young boy, who is their son. I won't go into details but he's the best character.

What would be cool.XoXo Emmii",The Mummy Returns

It has Great Effects, great acting, a great story, all done, by amazing people! If you liked the first Mummy, you will LOVE this one. It has action, adventure, romance and comedy all the way through, it's great! I have found nothing wrong with it. The story was very well written by a great man, Stephen Sommers. This one is very funny and keeps you entertained all the way through. The music is superb as well, it is also nice that the main cast returns as well as 92 percent of the crew! At first I was not sure of Freddie Boath but as soon as I saw the first scene he was in I knew that if a child of that age can act that well, the so can all the adults. Anyone whose anyone must see this movie. Nothing bad can be said about it. So, get to the cinema now and relive the adventure started off in the first one, and continued in this one.",The Mummy Returns

510,pope-1,Bad beyond believe,2,14 March 2004,"""The Mummy"" was nice and fun to watch, with the stress on ""fun"" in that the movie didn't take itself seriously at all, and had tendencies of being an action parody. I expected ""The Mummy"" to be a dumb action flick, and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't one. Now, knowing its prequel, I expected ""The Mummy Returns"" to be about as entertainingly funny. Well, I couldn't have been disappointed more. ""The Mummy Returns"" is just dumb. I mean, really dumb. Non-original, non-funny, non-entertainingly dumb. No traces left of the ""action parody"" approach, no traces worth mentioning of a plot, badly written and directed, really bad and most of all noticable CGI at times (while -strangely enough- being rather good at other times). It even fails on a design level in that the ancient egyptian look is totally unrealistic and over-the-top, all in all appearing rather un-egyptian (""The Mummy"" was halfway decent in this regard). ""The Mummy Returns"" tries to be a fully-fledged action flick, but even fails at that. The fighting sequences are lame and badly paced, the effects are silly and misplaced and barely state-of-the-art, even the sound design is awful as it often relies on known audio library effects that one knows just too well. ""The Mummy"" had a proper and fairly convincing feel in terms of showing 1920s people messing with ancient egyptian ghosts. Watching ""The Mummy Returns"" feels wrong throughout its entire length, it appears like 21st century people putting on a bad provincial stageplay or carnival show without really knowing what they're doing or how to do it. If movies are compositions, this one is incredibly badly composed. Don't waste your time or money unless you're expecting nothing, especially not a proper sequel.",The Mummy Returns

I know there was bad CGI in the first one which is dated but I can forgive it for that since it was 1999 CGI was still kind of new. Here though? It has been 3 years since the first movie the CGI should have gotten better but it didn't I got worse in my opinion3. I don't buy guy with the aircraft saving them at the end because they crash in the jungle, there is no way he could have fixed that huge aircraft there is no repair shop or anything and I don't think he would have the tools with him to fix it either.4. The rock was under used. It is why have him at the start then never see him again until the last 5 or 7 minutes of the movie? It is kinda false advertising since he is on the poster but hardly in the movie that itself5. I don't think the score for the film was better than the score in the first onePros?Great action scene/fight scenesLocations were niceThe bus scene in London where the mummies are going after them was well done.

517,Spider-19,Let the Summer of 2001 begin...,9,6 May 2001,"This is the first of the summer blockbusters, and like Gladiator last year, the summer is off to an impressive start.  The Mummy Returns is one hell of a good time..if you appreciate spectacle, than this is the movie for you. It doesn't let you up for breath for one second, and takes all the Egyptian mysticism and beauty of the first film and cranks it all the way up. I personally didn't like The Mummy when I walked out of the theater, but it grew on me with repeated viewings. This film has wowed from the very start. With assorted fun throwbacks to the original (the clumsy knocking over of pillars recollects the collapsing library, as well as forgetting a heiroglyphic at just the wrong moment), all the best characters return and become even more detailed.  Look forward to the exciting backstory of Evie. The best parts about this one is the developed character of Ardeth Bay (why is Oded Fehr not a superstar?) and the truly evil Anck Su-Namun. The only real disappointment is The Rock as the Scorpion King.  He opens and closes the film, and is the underlying story that propels the film, but he isn't much of a presence onscreen.  Why they chose him for this role is a mystery, especially since he turns into CGI during his most dramatic appearance. Rock fans are advised to pass.But anyone who misses the Indiana Jones films, was a fan of the original Mummy, or a fellow believer that they don't make good adventure movies anymore, this is a film for you.  Bring someone to cheer with, The Mummy Returns is a grand adventure...",The Mummy Returns
518,DSensi,Blah.,3,8 May 2001,"This movie is totally unsatisfying -- even on an eye candy level. The characters are 2 dimensional, the action has no purpose or sense and there's never any feeling of suspense here. You know the bad guys cannot shoot the good guys. You know death is reversable. You know everything will work out fine.I hate when scripts telegraph every plot point as done here. From the moment I saw the sceptre, I knew it was obviously going to play a key part in the hero's survival.Just once I'd like to be surprised by something subtle. I guess I shouldn't expect subtlety from a movie like The Mummy Returns.I think the effects (especially the lame animated Scorpion King) were nothing to rave about. The only thing that was kinda impressive was the battle scenes with Anubis' army -- they were pretty cool.
Does anyone else have a problem with the fact that the mummy warriors were able to burst through a brick wall, but were affected by Rick's punches?
Anyway, I think the worst part of the movie is that it made 70 million dollars already, thus prolonging Brendan Fraser's career. While I find him likeable in interviews and I enjoyed Monkeybone, he 's a god-awful actor, especially as a leading man.",The Mummy Returns
519,frobnoid,Worse than the XFL,1,3 May 2001,"This movie has some cool effects but is a typical, uninventive summer action movie.

During this time I had time to sit back and take in what I had been watching. Exhilarating, edge-of-the-seat action for over an hour, but why? What was happening? Why was it happening?Who knows? Who cares? The best way to describe this film is as a movie version of a rollercoaster. You know you should hate it but for some reason you strangely enjoy it.",The Mummy Returns

The story line was not great and there were many instances of gratuitous special effects.  The action was very well paced, it never stopped moving.  You MUST suspend you disbelief level, this is, after all, a movie about a Mummy and all sorts of supernatural happenings.  The film seems to try to emulate the movies of the 30's, and it makes many shots that take from other movies.  Sort of like Chicken Run, I like that.  I would say a good descriptor of the movie would be Abbot & Costello meet the Mummy with out the slapstick.  The kid and Jonathon provide great comic relief.  This is a movie to see on the big screen, just don't expect high art.",The Mummy Returns
522,draylorre,Incredible.,10,12 May 2001,"The Mummy returns is getting some bad critic reviews.  This just convinces me more that critics don't know what the hell they're talking about.  Before I saw this film on opening night, I watched The Mummy on DVD. Usually this just gets me hyped for the sequel only to have my hopes brutally destroyed once the film starts.  But The Mummy Returns holds its own with the original.  And very well.The basic plot is this:  Four thousand years ago, a powerful warrior called the Scorpion King (The Rock) led an army that was defeated after a seven year siege.  He pledges his soul to Anubis, god of death, in exchange for another army to destroy his enemies, after which his soul is sucked into limbo to await his awakening.  Supposedly taking place nine years after the first film, Rick O'Connel (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz)have married and have an eight year old son, Alex.  Alex finds the bracelet of the Scorpion King, which sets off a chain of events culminating in the King's resurrection in 7 days.  Whomever kills this warrior will gain control of his invincible army.  So starts the race between the O'Connels and the villains, led my the reincarnation of Imhotep's girlfriend Anck-su-namun, who want to resurrect the mummy again as he is the only one strong enough to defeat the Scorpion King.  Wackiness ensues.I think many critics hate this film because they're expecting either a detailed plot or a horror film.  This is an action movie, plain and simple. Things blow up, guns fire, and mummies roar like the damned.  And it's FUN. The actor's performances are excellent, particularly Freddie Boath as Alex O' Connel who is 1000% percent better than that annoying and talentless kid in the last Star Wars film.  The effects are excellent (with one exception, but I won't bitch about it here), Stephen Sommers' direction is flawless.  I had a few minor gripes with the film, but nothing major and I didn't really even notice them until the second time I saw it. Mainly though, there's the sense of humor.  Like the original, The Mummy Returns doesn't take itself too seriously, making many jokes about and even parodying it's predecessor once or twice.  I do wonder how they will make The Scorpion King as a spin off vehicle for The rock, when he has ten minutes of screen time here, only two lines (in ancient Egyptian I might add) and plays the most undetailed, cardboard cutout character ever.Face it people, action films will always be made, and this is how they should be done.",The Mummy Returns
523,ledzepfan215,"Good movie over all, but some confusing parts.",8,27 May 2001,"First...the special effects were very good. I liked how the oasis got sucked back into the temple at the end. The only special effect that I didn't think was all that good was The Scorpion King's face at the end when he was a giant scorpion...It looked too cartoonish and unreal. They should have imposed The Rock's face on the scorpions body. The fight scenes were great...especially the fight between Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velazquez...it was hot. The confusing part of the movie was about The Book of the Dead....in the original it made Imhotep mortal so he could be killed, but in this movie it brought someone back to life...How is that? I thought only The Book of Amun-Rha could bring people back from the dead, like it was said in the original. Plus, how did Anck-su-namun get brought back to life without the Book of Amun-Rha when the book fell into the liquid pit along with Imhotep in the original?  Overall it was a good movie.

Its rave reviews and constant chattering of my peers had me convinced that this would be a decent movie.  I was sadly disappointed.First of all, I WILL admit that the special effects are tremendous...some of the best I've ever seen.  However, the immense effects suffocate what little plot there is.  Action scenes  unimportant to the plot that drag on FOREVER, characters switching accents, and (most disturbingly) several cultural errors. For example: Reincarnation is a major underlying theme in this movie.  Anyone with only a minor knowledge of the culture KNOWS that the concept of reincarnation DID NOT EXIST AT ALL in Ancient Egyptian society. I'm sure there were many other errors of this sort, but I wouldn't know. I'm not majoring in Egyptology.With its tremendous effects that overshadow its feeble plot, shaky characters, and cultural faux pas, I would not recommend The Mummy Returns to anyone over the age of 12.",The Mummy Returns

I played one of the numerous ""evil red turban"" characters in 2 scenes: the unearthing of the mummy, and the pygmie mummy attack.And while I had an amazing time doing the film, I can't say that watching the finished product was nearly as much fun. This is a poorly made film. The script has the rambling logic of a 7 year-old's writing, the characters are terribly bland, and the end Scorpion King effects are a disgrace to modern movie making techniques. They would look poor in a Playstation computer game let alone on the silver screen.The film's supposed plot follows the further adventures of Indiana Jones wannabe Rick (Brendan Fraser) his wife Evie (Rachel Weisz- who since the last film wears a whole lot less and knows kung-fu) and their son, as they battle not one, but two enemies: The Scorpion King (the Rock, whose acting makes Arnie look like Al Pacino) and the resurrected Mummy from the first film.While the first film was no Raiders of the Lost Ark, it was a fairly enjoyable popcorn movie. This film takes all the weaknesses from the first film, then creates a whole load more- e.g even less of a plot, poorer special effects.Although the Mummy Returns undoubtedly has an audience for those desiring family suitable escapist fare, there are far, far better films that fit the bill: Go rent any Indiana Jones film, James Bond, or the Goonies !!!",The Mummy Returns
529,alderson,Too many problems to count,2,4 May 2001,"I had so many problems with this movie, I don't know where to begin.  Let me say that I am a fan of The Mummy (1999)... it's definitely a guilty pleasure.  That movie had a good plot, a good build up to the ""reveal"" of the mummy, hilarious one liners (""It's still... juicy""), and fun action sequences.The Mummy Returns doesn't have any of that.  We see the first supernatural beings about thirty seconds into the movie (the sand-doggies), and the first mummies about two minutes later.  And they're the same soldier mummies from the first movie.  Sigh.The action is so relentless that it gets boring, and rarely leaves time for any dialog at all, let alone anything funny.  The plot is rather painfully contrived, and not much is explained.  The romance between Evie and O'Connell is just plain sappy (""Cue violins... now kiss!"" got old after the 4th or 5th time, thanks), and loses the spark their relationship had in the first movie.And you know, I could suspend my disbelief about the whole supernatural ancient egyptian magic thing; after all, it's rather essential to the central theme of the movie.  I *refused* to suspend my disbelief about the hot air balloon with after burners.  That was just plain stupid.Don't get me started on the horridly inconsistent CGI work.  It was VERY bad at times, to the point of it looking like a video game.  The Rock as the scorpion king (at the end) looked so jarringly fake that I wanted to run far away from this film.  They must have just painted The Rock's face onto a CGI model, and it showed.  Mr. Potato Head from Toy Story had more emotion in his facial expressions.Oh well, this movie will make its millions.  But it doesn't deserve it.-John",The Mummy Returns

So we figured this would be about the same, but more of it. We couldn't be more right. Even though i do like the film's light- heartedness, the special effects are what (for me anyway) really ruined the film. Almost every single shot contains that damn CGI (i'll take stop-motion animation anyday). Not that i hate CGI, but it has to be functional, here it all seems too forced to be natural, heck, even the backgrounds of ancient Egypt looked fake, whereas in the Mummy they looked great. The action in the film was inventive and pacey, but again ruined by all that CGI rammed down your throat (you don't know where to look). Overall i'd say this is an enjoyable film, great for a Friday or Saturday night with your mates and spectacular fun for the kids, but for me the sometimes great, sometimes terrible CGI was way too much and the ending was disappointing too: they promised so much with it, but in the end all we have is a badly animated scorpion king.*** out of *****",The Mummy Returns

It was much more exciting and entertaining than the first Mummy.  However it does mainly rely on special effects and action to further the story line rather than actual plot.  But then again so did the first Mummy.  Another reason why it was so appealing was because it didn't really take it self seriously, and that being said nobody who goes to see the film should judge it that way.

The action is amped up, the special effects are great, and the expansion and elaboration on the themes of the first movie really tie them together and makes this one enjoyable. Rachel Weisz's character Evie in particular has evolved and is more sure of herself and sexy.  Her fight scenes are beautiful and particularly exciting. The addition of Alex, the son of Evie and Rick, actually flows well and adds a new dimension to the film, despite my fears that he would be disruptive to the dynamic established between the characters from the first film.

534,demon2k7,Kicks The Summer Off With Style,9,9 May 2001,"As neither a lover nor hater to movies, but rather a neutral movie reviewer I feel I can give a fair and summarised review of The Mummy Returns.First of all The Mummy Returns is no bad movie at all, in fact for a sequel it is rather good for this particular genre which has a track record for bad or below average sequels.Writer / Director Stephen Sommers could have taken some things into account when making this movie, for example . in The Mummy, we observed a growing relationship between Rick and Evie which gave us a view of how deep their characters were portrayed on-screen.The Mummy Returns however loses some of that depth and instead focuses more action based scripting and observation.There is some depth though but for all those who have not yet seen the movie, I will not give anything away.Graphically The Mummy Returns certainly delivers all the action you would expect Industrial Light & Magic to perform, proving that they are yet again the victors of special effects and digital animation.One area that brings movies like this to life is the musical score and Alan Silvestri does a great job of entertaining us in more ways that one.When I first heard that musical maestro Jerry Goldsmith was not going to score the movie, and instead Alan Silvestri was taking charge I felt somewhat displeased by the decision. However with movies such as The Abyss behind him, who was I to judge him unfairly?If you listen closely you will hear elements of other past movies in his composure, which works perfectly fine with this type of movie and all-in-all proves as a great musical piece.If you have seen The Mummy then I recommend this excellent sequel, however if you have not seen its predecessor then Sommers has done a very amicable job to ensure The Mummy Returns is as appealing to non-fans as it is to the hardcore fans of the 1999 original.Possibly the most action orientated movie for the next few summer months and a worthy trip to the theatres plus your entry fee.As with its predecessor The Mummy Returns does indeed kick off the summer movie season and with definite style too.It is no Academy Award winner by any means, don't get me wrong there, but it is a top-class action adventure flick that we all can enjoy non-the-less.The Mummy Returns: 7/10The Mummy (1999): 7/10",The Mummy Returns

While not as good as the first, it still carried itself well, as well as explained a few things from the original. (small spoiler, if you haven't seen the website or one of a few other places that had this written) Having Rick and Evelyn married with a son was great, it allowed the movie to show how they had matured while still staying the same. (I hadn't seen that written anywhere, but my mom told me this morning that she already knew about it, even though she hadn't seen the movie.) It was really good over all, but I felt they could have done more explaining of the Scorpion King's character, but then that's what they're making a third movie for, so I guess that part is ok after all.",The Mummy Returns

It does give a good try and if you liked the first one, you will probably like this one as well.

But in the same breath let me say that it is a poor sequel.The Mummy Returns succeeds in the same way as The Mummy. Lots of action, adventure, suspense, and the right amount of humor at just the right time.But The Mummy Returns doesn't carry the same magic that made The Mummy such a wonderful hit. It's more of a action thrill ride (though there's nothing wrong with that) where The Mummy was a action filled horror film. In this sequel the horror part of the story is replaced with more fighting and more special effects. While this does make a good movie it change from The Mummy's creepier look.You you go see The Mummy Returns looking for the next film in the mummy horror genre you may be disappointed.

542,Tracie-1,More than just another sequel,10,1 June 2001,"OK we all know the story about sequels.  ""They can never match the original"".  Well I dare anyone to say that about this sequel.  Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weiss return to resurrect their roles as the 1940's explorers.This time round the couple are married, and have a son.  When they open a box in an ancient Egyptian tomb they set forth a course of events that could release the Scorpion king.Incidentally the Scorpion king is played by WWF wrestler ""The Rock"" and I have to say he wasn't entirely bad in his role.Whoever can kill the Scorpion king can take control of his armies and either rule the world with them or send them back to the underworld where they came from.  So naturally a group of people call forth Imotep(I know I didn't spell that right).  They believe the ancient mummy is the only person that will be able to defeat the scorpion king and control his armies.John Hannah also returns as the wimpy, clumsy brother to Evie, and provides some hilarious moments.  Evie's son is also hilarious with his innocent childlike confidence and total faith in his father.The romantic moments between Frasier and Weiss are often comical and heart-warming, but the main attraction to this film is undoubtedly the superb effects and excellent directing.  The effects in this film are far superior to the original.  The fight scenes are more dramatic and will leave even most sceptical in awe of them.  I would recommend that everyone go see this film as soon as possible, 10/10",The Mummy Returns
543,screamjoey,The Mummy cannot miss,10,2 June 2001,"130 minutes of a roller coaster, fighting, war, humorous and that's is just not all. The acting in this movie is unreal they act as if the situation they are in is really happening they all have great potential in acting. The graphics in this movie i could not believe it was just great i would have to say 10/10 for graphics. It's just a roller coaster the movie makes you sit down and listen.

We have all the original actors starring in the same roles. Not to mention the addition of the ""bart simpson"" like Alex character, son of Rick and Evie. He was a pointless addition, as it's obvious he's just there for brief (and un-funny) comic relief. John Hannah revises his role of 'Jonathan Carnahan, and is painfully annoying in this picture. He was much more entertaining in the first movie, and is disgraced even more in this. Aside from the flat and boring characters, we have the love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun, which is a disgrace to to any love story ever written. They have no chemistry, and the audience does not feel anything for them. If you are going for the graphics, you will be sorely disappointed.The graphics in this movie look like they were cut and pasted from a nintendo game. If you are a fan of the first movie, and have any respect for it, do not see this movie, as you will lose all love and respect for the series.",The Mummy Returns

This is a true popcorn film, and it's does not pretend to be anything else other than that. To be quite honest, it is probably better than the first for the simple fact that it has allot more to it than the original. To even Try to compare this movie to Indiana Jones is wrong. They are nothing a like, besides the fact that they are as fun as they come. If you are a sad movie fan who lives at home and likes to put down good films for the simple fact that you have no life, then don't watch this film.

It is the worst, most overrated film I have ever seen.  First of all, parts of it felt like the characters KNEW they were making a bad sequel. Comments like ""Here we go again."" and ""I thought we killed him"" are never a good thing.  Second, the special effects were sub par.  The scorpion king looked like a smashed roach behind the wall of Joe's apartment.  Third, the plot was not very convincing or believable. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! When the scorpion king's army attacks, somehow they all die but the ""good guys"" (whoever they are, I wasn't really sure) do not receive a scratch. It seems possible that hordes of sand monsters could inflict a little damage.This was possibly the Worst movie I saw last summer.

I had more fun watching this film than most of the movies I have seen this year. It even out does the original, and that in it's self is a great achievement considering the fact that most sequels really do suck. If you have nothing better to do other than to criticize the reasons on why people like movies like this, then do yourself (and all of us a favor) and don't watch this film.

I like both films but I am gonna give this a 7/10 and The mummy 8/10.  I think they're great to relax and enjoy... and the perfect movie for the familty... but... they are not as good as Indiana and so they do not achieve higher than the ratings I have offered them.All I want to say is, If you liked the 1st one... this will not disappoint you.  If you hated the first one, this will do little to change your opinion.Very entertaining, good cast, worth a look..... a video hire at the least. 7/10",The Mummy Returns

The whole cast from the original is back (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz make a great par), and better than ever with a few surprises up their sleeve, and they don't disappoint. The special effects are a step up from the first, and the story is almost as good.

It's a great reminder of the Saturday serials movies, and keeps up the tradition very well. Kudos to all involved in this making this film such a wonderful ride.  If you don't know how to have fun, then keep away. This is for people who love action and adventure.P.S. I think it's right up there with Indiana Jones.",The Mummy Returns
555,frrkff@hotmail.com,plot loses to bigtime action,3,9 August 2002,"Even if the stars do a great job, the action is definitely the biggest star in this film, as in the others in the series, and therefore the story has it faults. But if you go for a rollercoaster ride, do you expect subtlety? I hope not, and with that in mind, a lot can be forgiven in this kind of movie, but some things just plain bug me. Like how ** SPOILER WARNING** Anck-su-namun would leave her beloved because she is afraid of a little raining stone! This girl killed a god (or at least a man perceived as one) for Imhotep, and she has already been brought back to life, still she freezes in fear while our brave (and beautiful) Rachel Weizs races to the rescue. **SPOILER END** And most times we are going directly from the one big action scene to the other, without any pause or development of plot. Mostly because of the lack of it. Still, the film could be really good for what it is attempting, cut the brakes and full gas and all that stuff, but then at least they should have gotten the special-effects right so the scorpion king didn`t look like a plastic doll. Back to the rollercoaster example. It is often the slow ride before you plunge, where you hold the breath and wait in excitement that makes the moment, but here you just keep on going downwards from the cool beginning to the more and more excruciating ending.",The Mummy Returns
556,Universalmike15,One of the best sequels ever,10,19 July 2012,"I remember the day when i saw The Mummy (1999) and thought to myself, ""this is a damn good movie! I'd love to see the sequel!"" And, sure enough, the sequel was released just two days later. The opening of the film had already utilized many special effects including the Tower at Thebes and the two armies fighting till the death. Also, The Rock (even though his only line was in Ancient Egyptian) was still pretty solid. After an intense war scene, we finally arrive on the O'connells. Rick (Brendan Fraser) is now a family man. his son, Alex, shows as much strength and warmth that both Evy and Rick have. Throughout the film, the relationship within the family grew and amassed to that of an odd family. The film doesn't slow down yet, we are then treated to beautiful sets that have you believe they actually were in Egypt all those years ago. Also, Alan Silvestri has a truly magnificent score that is used to its fullest potential. The film takes us to Hamunaptra, where Imhotep is found inside of some cocoon like object. later, we are at the museum in a truly memorable fight sequence. There are also some nice scenes to look at, interesting dialogue. And, some AMAZING special effects.Overall Consensus: The Mummy Returns is, without a doubt, the best Sequel ever made. It's fun, engaging, Beautifully shot/acted and will make the audience feel as if sand is between their toes, wanting to see more of the action.",The Mummy Returns

And underrated director like Stephen Sommers comes up with an idea that completely overshadows the works of the VERY overrated Mr. Spielburg(!), and all a bunch of mindless morons want to do is put it down for no reason! The Mummy and The Mummy Returns are so equally great, I count them as one long awesome spectacular!! Take the handsome, talented, fun, and funny Brendan Fraser, give him a wonderful action hero to play, and you have a character that puts Harrison Ford's hard boiled, ""takes himself too seriously"" Indiana Jones to complete shame! Combine Mr Fraser with the beautiful and very talented Rachel Wiez, and you have an unbeatable team in more ways than just one. I could go on and on about the rest of this awesome cast, but their movies(raking in over 400 million each!) speak for themselves! The sad thing is, we only got to see these rare treats (the actors) come together twice. Thats Hollywood politics for you. Thanks to Mr. Spielburg and Mr. Lucas being put up on high horses they don't deserve to be on, next summer we get to put up with an aging Harrison Ford putting on a hat and giving us another bad Humphrey Bogart impersonation.

The CGI is horrifying, the acting is laughable, and the story is now great. But I still thing this film and the others are worth watching. Also on a side note I don't understand the hate for Brendan. Sure he isn't an amazing actor, but he's far from terrible. I haven't ever seen a film with him I disliked.",The Mummy Returns

I don't say this very much but this is a sequel better than the first. There is tons of action and suspense to keep you going. And the sound and visual effects in this movie are awesome. Especially that of Hemotep, the mummy. If you don't like action packed movies, or bugs I would suggest that you don't watch this, but for every one else I would suggest it! The plot is written pretty well and they have great actors for the roles. The villains are really cool and they now have a kid who joins them on the adventure. This is a must see movie for people of all ages! It is also a fun movie to watch on a family night or something. I give it an 8!",The Mummy Returns
560,timee4,"""It's hard being a dad""",9,30 January 2006,This movie has it all. Action. Comedy. Romance. Rachel Weiz (check out her flash back fight sequence!) and the Pigmys who teach us a very valuable lesson - don't run with explosives. And lets also not forget the lesson we learn from Rick (Brendan Fraiser) that parenting can be absolute hell. And of Course we can't forget the battle between the medjai and the Dog warriors which totally kicked ass. You also get to see a more helpless and loving side of Imhotep (it's always good to see villains at their weak point). If u haven't seen this movie u don't know what your missing!. It's an action packed ride full of laughs (plus you get to see the Rock's first time at acting),The Mummy Returns

562,The WolF,"The Mummy Returns, postage due.",7,8 May 2001,"I'll start by saying I liked the movie. No, it wasn't as good as the first. I wouldn't even say the effects were as good as the first (which I rewatched the night before on DVD). The cool ""face effect"" is back. More than once. Not done quite as well, either. While I thought the idea of what happens to the Scorpion King was good, the effect used to pull it off doesn't quite make it. Too many characters, not enough plot. If you like One-liners, you'll have something to look forward to.So, why did I like the movie with all this going against it? The action never stops. The movie hits the ground running and keeps going. Yes, the final rescue is more than a little silly, but the ""Yes it is!"" line (nearly) makes up for it. It's not a great movie, and it knows it. It IS a fun movie, and it does that well.If you're looking for a movie like War And Peace, why the heck did you go see a movie called ""The Mummy Returns"" ? Go watch What Planet Are You From? instead. The rest of us will enjoy the sequel.",The Mummy Returns
563,supa-2,Blows the first one away...,8,2 May 2001,"Before getting into my ""comments"", I'd just like to say that I loathed ""The Mummy"" for one reason--the mummy looked absolutely ridiculous.  The (in my opinion) terrible CGI look of Imhotep took me out of the movie.  ""The Mummy Returns"" is plagued with a similar problem, but because the good far outweighs the bad, I can forgive them (I'll discuss this at the end--beware it contains SPOILERS).""The Mummy Returns"" picks up 8 years after the previous film.  Although the characters haven't physically aged, their on-screen chemistry (mainly between Fraser and Weisz) has improved.  Thrown into the mix is an 8-year old named Alex (Freddie Boath) who shows the world that children *can* act, a warrior/guide (reprised by Oded Fehr), the bumbling brother (John Hannah), and an airship pilot (actor unknown).  All together this group makes a likeable team off to save the world (again)from two threats--the resurrected Imhotep and also resurrected Scorpion King (lots of resurrection in this flick).  The movie is paced very well with plenty of action, battle scenes, and one on one fighting as well as some slower travelling scenes and romantic moments.  It seems like the writer/director (Stephen Sommers) followed a number of conventions popularized by recent hits (""Gladiator""/""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" weapon fights, ""The Matrix"" like one on one fights, ""Braveheart"" like battles, and ""The Phantom Menace"" like CGI characters). The result pays off.  The action is peppered with one-liners and hilarious sight gags (The pygmies are fantastic and reminiscent of ""Gremlins"").  It's nice that the film doesn't take itself too seriously.  The DTS sound in the film is some of the best ever--it will be nominated for best sound.  The film would have been the perfect ""popcorn"" flick (although I despise people that eat in theaters) except for one huge flaw:  BIG SPOILER  At the end of the film, Fraser faces off with the resurrected Scorpion King.  Rather than using the Rock for the finale, the Scorpion King takes the form of a giant scorpion with a CG model of the Rock's head.  Unfortunately, the result is less than spectacular--it blows.  All of the other CGI creatures are fantastic (Imhotep's eyes are some of the best ever seen on a CGI creature). The scorpion monster looks unfinished--It's as if they made some sort of CG mockup for test audiences and said ""We'll finish that guy up later"", but then they forgot to.  It just goes to show that we're years away from being able to CG model a human actor. I would have preferred either a giant scorpion (minus the Rock's head) or just the Rock himself.  But overall, the film was good--it was a case of my low expectations being exceeded, and that's always a good feeling.",The Mummy Returns

Where 'The Mummy' was silly but fun and had some witty dialogue, 'The Mummy Returns' is a series of disjointed special effects shots, tied together by a plot which, once you've made the effort to figure out what's going on you wonder why you've bothered. There isn't one decent line of dialogue in the film. The couple's child speaks (as does almost every child in every film, to be fair) as though he was written by a 40 year old. Don't get me started on the multitude of gaffes and logical chasms. ***Potential spoiler by way of an example*** : Men cannot run faster than light, even if they have the physique of Brendan Fraser.",The Mummy Returns

567,ken-240,Probably the loudest soundtrack ever!,5,20 June 2001,A fast action pace from beginning to end. Children are generally awful in films but Freddie Boath (Alex O'Connell) was a real exception and enjoyed some of the funnier moments in the film.  All the principles reprise their roles from the first film with the only new character being the introduction of the 'Rock' as the Scorpion King.  I'm not sure but it was probably for the best that he had limited screen time.Nothing is added to the characters from the first film.  The cgi work is appalling and the scorpion king looks terrible.  Certainly inferior to what was seen in SW:TPM.  The 'blimp' thing is horrible.  I find it easy to suspend belief in the supernatural aspects of the story but this vehicle just didn't work for me.  There were no real surprises in the effects work and it was really just a carry over in most respects from the first film.,The Mummy Returns

570,BobTop,A worthy sequel,8,4 May 2001,"This is a movie I have been waiting to see since the first movie.  I thought that the story was fairly well written, and thought that a sequel, if well done, would be great fun.I wasn't disappointed.  The movie takes up 10 years after the events in the first movie; Rick and Evie are married and have a son, Alex, and are living in London when they're not on digs in Egypt.  Now that the Bembridge Scholars have come to their senses, Evie is working at the British Museum, and has begun to have strange dreams and waking visions of her in ancient Egypt.Enter Imhotep, newly resurrected by his followers, who is going to rule the Army of Anubis and take over the world.  Anksunamun is also there, in the flesh, to help Imhotep on his mission.  His mission is to defeat The Scorpion King, the ancient leader of the Army of Anubis, played by The Rock. Lots of action, fighting, mummies running up walls and golden pyramids later, our heroes prevail (as if you expected otherwise?)The story runs pretty smoothly throughout and the acting is pretty good, at least as good as the first movie.  I wasn't expecting Oscar nominations out of this movie.  If you are, wait until it comes out on video and save a couple of bucks for your disappointment.  The special effects were OK, too, though a lot of them were rehashes from the first one (wall of water instead of sand, Imhotep absorbing the souls of his victims to gain strength, mummies running on the walls, scarabs coming out of the sand, etc.)  The most annoying part of the movie, which I had problems getting past, was the very poor quality of the computer-generated graphics involving The Scorpion King in the last bit of the movie.  Given the high quality of the rest of the CGI, from the recreations of Carnac to the Army of Anubis to Imhotep-in-tatters, this was very difficult not to notice. Overall, a good adventure flick with a couple of good laughs thrown in, this should be on a par with the original Mummy in terms of success and viewability.

The special effects were amazing and at the same time disappointing.  It seemed that Sommers (director) couldn't leave one single frame untouched by special effects.  To be sure the graphics were quite realistic, but in the way they were used it was so over the top and outlandish that the 'specialness' (if that is a word) of the effect was lost.The original had a bit more of a quality story for what is at the most basic level a B-line movie.  The Mummy Returns was full of too many characters: The brother-in-law and the child were of no use and did nothing to advance the plot.  The Scorpion King was a thin plot device to use two evil characters instead of one bad guy. It is a sequel and therefore must have more baddies.Special effects were best put to use in the panorama/CGI images of ancient Egypt, the large battle scenes and in the visionary use of the Scorpion bracelet.  Otherwise, the closeups of CGI monsters, The half-scorpion/half-Rock creature at the end, the pygmy mummies, the dirigible/boat combo were altogether uninspiring.Overall I have to give it a 6.

Among the things that I disliked, the reincarnation business, the predictability, the rocket power dirigible, the overly cutesy kid, and the hype surrounding the Rock (the guy was in 5 minutes of the movie and never actually said anything).

The one major screw up in this movie is near the end of it. When the Scorpion King appears as a scorpion.  They would have been much better off having him morph into a human form and then fight. It looks to much like he is fighting a cartoon !",The Mummy Returns
581,danielagro3,"Not just 9/10, rather 99 out of 100. EXCELLENT movie.",9,25 May 2001,"Short version of review: See above. A must-see! It is *virtually* as good as ANY action-packed movie can EVER get. Excellent.Long version of review: Well, I haven't seen the first film... yet. I am going to rent it now, after watching the sequel :) If it's one forth as good, I would definitely enjoy it *a lot*. Back to The Mummy Returns. What do you know? It does return!! :) Although I didn't know it was gone :))) Let me list the major points of enjoyment for me in this movie. 1. Astonishing DYNAMICS. Non-stop action, suspense, thrill, awe, use your favorite word. A roller-coaster of fun, as they say :) Enough to make me want going for it again. Yes, that good. *Very few* compare. 2. Scenes, sets, props, views, ... you name it. Eye-candy, as they say :) Also VERY good. Breathtaking views, indeed. Tower Bridge (erroneously referred to as the ""London Bridge"" :) at night is fantastic. The endless desert, the ancient Egyptian sites, the Pyramids. Loved'em all :) 3. Cast! Now, don't get me wrong -- no stellar performances here. But neither such are needed here, believe it or not. It all blends together perfectly the way it is. And this is that way: all actors are very well-chosen and suitable for their roles. Including The Rock. He is great, by the way. In the beginning, that is. Some say the Scorpion King in the end is cartoonish and awful? Never mind, he's OK. Perhaps, could have been a little better. OK, I admit it: could have been way better. So what? The film goes along with it and is watchable and very much enjoyable. Nobody's perfect, ya know :) And one more note on the cast -- diversity! A LOAD of different characters, a majority of them are leading roles :))) It's FUN. 4. Battle scenes deserve to be a separate entry. Really. I was blown away!! The movie could have been titled The Grand Battles In The Desert. Again, enough to make the film a must-see on their own. 5. Sound and music. On a par with the best!! Very convincing, enjoyable, touching. Loud. And in this movie, it also is a merit. This movie startles, and terrific sound takes much credit for that.Now... STOP READING THE REVIEWS. GO OUT AND BUY A TICKET TO ONE OF THE BEST ACTION/ADVENTURE FILMS EVER.",The Mummy Returns

Avoid it at all costs!!",The Mummy Returns
583,obisteffs,Good new direction,8,4 May 2001,"The Mummy is just one of those movies that I enjoy more each time I see it. In 1999 I was expecting an action adventure film and instead was treated to a nicely paced horror movie with a new touch due to Stephen Sommers. In the sequel Sommers changed the direction from horror to what I was originally expecting. This change in genre was one of the smartest things Sommers could have done in giving us more of the same, but different. Much like the difference between Alien and Aliens. They are really two different films.One of the reasons I enjoyed the Mummy more each time is due to the enjoyable characters. For one reason or another I really wanted to know what happened to these people and getting to see them 10 years later was a big bonus. Most of the characters have more defined roles this time and its good to see some character growth in a sequel.The plot is thrown at us faster this time around with much more going on. But Stephen Sommers never cheats with the writing. Everything is mentioned once, twice, and then action! A familiarity with the first one is helpful since Sommers has the kid experience many of the same things his parents did last time creating some cross generation/movie jokes. Sommers also respects the conventions of the original Universal Mummy movies giving us an excellent climax that is above the usual action. Like the original Mummy this plot is one that has the ability to grow on you more with multiple viewings.The crew behind the scenes do an excellent job as they did before. Cinematography, Sound, and Art Direction all create an engrossing movie experience. Alan Silvestri picks up Jerry Goldsmith's score and continues its themes. Their are some FX quibbles from ILM but mostly just some weird background and the finale features a creature on par with 1997's Lost in Space that could stand some improvement. But they also have some great set pieces with the returning Warrior Mummies and an impressive ground battle that reminds one of the Phantom Menace's. Meanwhile Sommers has obviously been influenced by some of his competition in summer's past. Some of the fight scenes have some Gladiator and Matrix-esque touches to them that seem out of place in a movie like this. Sommers directorial style was so clean in the Mummy and his previous adventure Deep Rising that these flashes of slow-mo stand out very conspiciously. To his credit everything else is framed very well with some great introductions for our heroes.While it's true that the Mummy Returns isn't terribly original, it does derive from the best. The Mummy had a hard time getting out from Indiana Jones' shadow and the sequel seems to embrace this with many elements reminisicent of Indy's first sequel The Temple of Doom. Spielberg and Lucas influences abound as well as an image from James Cameron and a small Kubrick nod. (See if you can find the Dr. Strangelove homage.) But it's all in good fun as we are taken on this incredible adventure. If you enjoyed the first film you'll be very satisfied by the change in direction for this one. Its far enough from the original to give you a new experience but it never forgets the original. While their are deeper film experiences out there you'll be very happy if you're in the mood for a fun adventure. This is a cast and crew that loves what they're doing and it influences the audience in a very positive way. Bring the popcorn and enjoy!",The Mummy Returns
584,rhun,"Ok, but not up to the level of the original",6,21 July 2001,"One major problem with this film is the fact that it would make absolutely no sense without seeing the first film.  That is a key ingredient in sequels.  One example where it is done right is 'The Empire Strikes Back.' The film was basicly a roller coaster of action to action.  I'm not totally putting down on this film though.  There were good sections, the effects were great (ILM yet again did a wonderful and convincing job.)  The fact is if you want to go see a movie and not have to think much this is a movie for you.  Give it a chance.",The Mummy Returns
585,Daryk_Stone,"The Pros and Cons of The Ultimate sequel to ""The Mummy""",10,16 May 2001,"The Mummy Returns was an excellent movie. I thought that it was better than the sequel. There are several reasons why it was so great. The action scenes were superb. The special effects were totally awesome. There are many more reasons as well.One thing that ticks me off is that everyone expects a `Ghandi' plot. I thought the storyline fit the movie. What we must remember is that this is NOT `Ghandi', this is an action movie. Did any of the Star Wars movies have good storylines? I THINK NOT! All the Star Wars series had was a unknowingly powerful man goes on a long adventure to save a princess and the world.Another thing that I quite like is that the director used generally the same cast. One good thing was that Rick and Evelyn stayed together, and had a child. Usually sequels create a downfall relationship not shown in the movie so they may either get rid of some of the cast and / or restart the relationships.The only thing that I did not like was the end scene with the Scorpion King. He was a giant scorpion with the head of Dwayne Johnson (The Rock). You could totally tell that his head was completely computer generated; it didn't seem to fit. The Scorpion King was not in the movie enough.Another thing that ticks me off is that people only want to see what they want to see in the sequel. They come up-in their mind-what they want the sequel to be like. Then when it doesn't happen, they complain. This is just like `Star Wars Episode One'. The Writers are the story tellers, NOT YOU!!!",The Mummy Returns
586,wwwkenorg,I was hoping for better.,3,11 May 2001,"My mummy taught me that if there is nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all.  Then again, I never did listen much. The first movie was, in my opinion, terrific and lots of fun to watch. Several scenes in the sequel are very similar to the first, except the special effects have gotten worse (at some points, especially the end, I felt like I was watching someone play a Playstation game... great graphics for a game, horrible for a movie in the year 2001).  There were a few laughs provided by the youngest star, but other than that, it ran a bit flat.A definite wait-till-it's-on-video type of movie.",The Mummy Returns
587,dlillib,Better than the first - WITH A GOOD PLOT!,10,21 May 2001,"First of all, I need to get the subject of 'plot' out of the way.  This movie has lots of plot, and a good plot for an action film. Why people keep saying in every review for every movie I've read that there's no plot is beyond me. IT'S AN ACTION MOVIE!!! DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE A ""GODFATHER"" PLOT? NO!!!  DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE A ""TERMS OF ENDEARMENT"" PLOT? NO!!! DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE A ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" PLOT? NO!!!  Action films are supposed to have a fast paced plot with characters that keep it moving.  If the characters were as detailed as ""Hamlet"" then it wouldn't be an action film, now would it? Every review above and below me that says ""there's no plot"" should be banned from watching action films!  And I thought this one had one of the better plots among action movies.  There, I feel better.** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** Ok, now for my review.  I thought this movie was better than the first.  It wasn't as comical as the first, which is good because every time a sequel tries to be more funny than the first, it's usually worse.  The comic relief (Johnathan Hannah) and the ""kid factor"" (Freddie Boath) were kept just enough in the distance to keep from being annoying.  The special effects weren't flawless, but alot of time went into them.  Glad to see the main characters from the original were back.  Also glad to see that they didn't over-do the bugs.  There were still plenty of creepy crawly things, but I thought the whole movie would be non-stop bugs after seeing how they used them in the first movie....thank God.  I wish The Rock would have had a bigger role at the end, but I thought it was cool to see him come back in ""final boss"" form, even if it was a computerized Rock.All in all, I left very happy.  So are they going to battle Anubus himself in the third movie?  Can't wait!!",The Mummy Returns
588,batneil,Below-par formulaic action block-buster.,3,3 June 2001,"Having not seen The Mummy, but having heard favorable reviews of it, I was in optimistic mood when sitting down to watch the sequel.  It was not long before I was disappointed.From the outset, The Mummy Returns makes heavy use of the now almost ubiquitous computer graphics techniques.  Though computer animation can yield extremely impressive results, this film falls into the same pitfall as Star Wars Episode 1, in that it goes for quantity not quality.  This inevitably detracts from the overall effect of the movie, as the special effects are too weak and unconvincing to add anything to the film, and so numerous as to distract the viewer from the rest of the show.The plot is, as one would expect in an action sequel, thin at best and although there is nothing inherently wrong with the story, it all seems vaguely familiar from somewhere.  It is easy to spot the elements borrowed from other films, most commonly the Indiana Jones series, but unfortunately none of it hangs together well enough to really work.The acting on display is notable for neither absence nor abundance of quality, although the film (and its stunt actors) should be commended for some well choreographed fight sequences.Overall, the film is more or less what we've come to expect from big budget action sequels, falling into the same category as films like Jurassic Park 2; entertaining enough if you can be bothered, but really nothing to get excited about, and very, very forgettable.",The Mummy Returns
589,cude,woah!,6,15 May 2001,"When i watch this at the cinema with some friends, almost all of them thought that the original mummy was much better.  To tell you the truth, i was not a big fan of the first mummy movie.  I thought the the ""mummy"" (the main bad guy) was rather weak and not scary at all, as he was supposed to be.In the mummy returns, the ""mummy"" was still just as weak but i thought he was more acceptable here since he had a human side to him now, he had a love relationship with the snake woman, which was somehow connected to Evelyn, the main female character, (there is some attempts at a story).  Also, he was vulnerable at the end which made him gave him more human qualities.As you can tell from my comments, i have no idea what most of the character's names are, character not greatly emphasized in the movie.  In fact, the most interesting character in this movie was the ""mummy"" himself. It was also better than the first installment since it had a nice intro explaining how the scorpion king came about to getting his powers.One part of the movie i have to congratulate them on (no matter how out of place it was) is the balloon scene at night, it looked really cosy with the stars in the background and kerosene lamps hanging around.  There were also many gripping scenes in the movie, many ""close encounters"", which were similar to the ""t-rex chasing car"" scene from jurassic park.  Sure, the plot was a little hard to follow (what plot?), but the fast paced action and CG kept me on the edge of my seat.  Also, has stephen sommers even seen indiana jones and the last crusade??  the guy at the end is not supposed to get the diamond, hes supposed to drop it or something cos its too heavy.  nb, i can tell it was fake from the back row.Overall, the movie could of had some nice character development with an interesting plot, and a FEW memorable suspense/action sequences... but full on action is fine too i guess.  Its worth watching on the big screen, since i don't think it'll be worth it on the small.( 3 / 5 )",The Mummy Returns

591,trishaz,"Decent, as far as sequels go.",7,4 May 2001,"In love with the first ""Mummy,"" I began losing my enthusiasm for the sequel when the previews failed to really interest me. The movie looked like it would focus on re-using the good parts from the first movie. (The face in the sand, the scary mummy guards, etc). For the most part, that is what has happened in ""The Mummy Returns."" The story lacks cohesiveness. I felt dizzy going from Egypt to London and back to Egypt. And while I know the third movie is to be about the Scorpion King, the Scorpion King's role in ""The Mummy Returns"" seems very forced and out of place. The sparks that flew between Fraser and Weisz in the first movie are nearly dead as the two adventurers are now married with child.

596,damndirtyape182,"Praise the heavens, FUN movies are back",10,11 May 2001,"Warning, these comments will contain spoilers.I must start by mentioning that when first seeing THE MUMMY I was underwhelmed, however after purchasing the film as one of my first DVD's something inexplicable happened, I had fun, for some reason everything just clicked in my brain and the cheezy plot and sometimes ropey CGI became one of the most enjoyable experiences that I had ever seen. Since that moment although I have enjoyed a number of films including CROUCHING TIGER & TRAFFIC, I can only claim a few being as fun as THE MUMMY such as GALAXY QUEST & now THE MUMMY RETURNS. I couldn't comment on this film without first responding to critisisms to the break-neck pace which the film travels. I have always believed that action films should only rest when introducing characters who should then be developed within the action sequences, this sequel takes the logical step of assuming prior knowlege of the first film so doesn't waste time making us get to know them all over again. Not only does this give a good reason to start the film with a bang, but also provides some truly inspired ways of developing characters such as the flashback sequences with particular mention to the alternate version of the opening sequence from the first film.But the one thing that a film like this needs is action and effects and the film more than succeeds in both catergories, I know a lot of mention has been made about the final battle with the Anubis warriors and this was nothing short of stunning, on par with the final battle would have to be the bus sequence which returns the extremely cool soldier mummies from the first film and creates one of the most exhilerating vehicle sequences ever, the highlight for me was the 1/2 mummy fighting Ardeth Bay. I also enjoyed the reworking of the face on the wall of sand sequence and found that for some reason it worked even better this time (probably because it wasn't over-hyped on the preview). Special mention also goes to the pygmie mummies which was an idea I never thought would work but was handled brilliantly with just the right level of surprise and action while also managing to never take itself seriously.The special effects all manage to impress from the subtle work done creating the small scorpian at the start of the film to the incredible creation of the oasis immediatly afterwards. The mummies all looked fantastic with a noticeable improvement made with Imhotep.However the effects I was most waiting for were the Anubis army and the Scorpian King, and while the Anubis army was amazing I felt that the Scorpian King's initial shots were less than impressive, however after about 6 seconds something happened, it starting running around taking chunks out of pillars and knocking over scenery, this is where the CGI suceeded in my opinion as the the amount of interaction with the surroundings was incredible for all the CGI creations and helped me suspend disbelief for the entire film.I had no problem with the Rock's limited screentime because it was all the film needed, it's worth noting that Anuck-sa-na-mun had very little overall screentime in the first film but has still developed into an extremely interesting character.Other elements that worked extremely well included the use of Jokes with direct reference to the first film and the great new score by Alan Sivestri which would rate as one of his best.I would give the film a 10 for delivering the fun film I wanted to see without disappointment (a rare event indeed).The short story is, go and see this film. Forget about things like realism and spotting elements from other films and just try to do something that is becoming increasingly hard to do with films... ...Enjoy yourself",The Mummy Returns
597,sluth,"Tacky, gaudy",4,13 May 2001,"The sequel to ""The Mummy"" is no where near the cynicism, adventure, and comedy of the first movie. There are many scenes that too closely resemble exactly what was seen in the first movie, and the actors spout out too many cheesy lines to make this movie comfortable.On the plus side, watching the sequel gives you some historic background to the first movie that you did not have before.

601,weerab710,Great Sequel.,6,22 May 2001,"Often I visit these pages for different movies and find it disheartening to see so many critics not being fair, they either say ""Pathetic, Terrible"" or ""Best Film Ever, A Must See""Well, I hope to give you a balanced understanding of the film as I saw it. The film overall is very good, the sequel follows pretty close to the original scene set out in the first movie and so fairs well with those who have seen the first whilst still maintaning enough material so that viewers who have not seen the first can enjoy the film.The Acting is not perfect but is still put accross well. I agree with some of the comments posted here, that the child does not fit with the characters and plotlines, there should have been some development with the main characters' relationship with each other before a family was introduced, especially if they are releasing a third!Sadly though the film falls into the tired stereotypical view of a sequel, where the writer has not spent enough time in developing the plot so that each event affects the relationship between all characters. As a result the characters appear flat and do not relate very well with the audience. However this is still no where near as bad as some of the sequels I have seen before, like the terrible regurgitation that Disney's ""Dinosaur""  is to Don Bleuth's  ""The Land Before Time""If there is one word to describe the plot in this movie, the word would be ""Linear""I will add a bit more though and talk about the SFX for a moment, generally the sfx were good but in the last scene when the Scorpion King appears I laughed at how terrible that effect was, it seemed to me that they wanted to finnish this scene as quickly and as cheaply as possible(Perhaps their budget ran out?) It was terribly unconvincing,  but that is not to say that it is easy to do - it takes a lot of skill and I always respect that no matter how unconvincing the effect.My vote for this film is 6/10 as it was enjoyable and entertaining but lacked the proper depth that is needed to make a good film.",The Mummy Returns

If you have ever seen the original, you will know exactly what you are getting yourself into with the sequel. A sequel in my opinion that is much better than the first film because it keeps you on the edged of your seat from the beginning to the end. The acting is very top notch, and the Special Effects are just breathtaking to watch.  Brendan Fraser is Great, and so is Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah but the Real achievement in this film Is Rachel Weisz who literally steals the movie from every body with her performance. The fight scene with her and Patricia Velasquez is a sight to behold. If you want to ponder the fate of movie making, and it's short comings, don't see this movie.

This is not a movie that is going to redefined film making, it's a movie that is surposed to be fun to watch; and it is. I had more fun watching this film than most of the movies I have seen this year. It's a great reminder of the Indiana Jones films, and a damn good one to boot. It even out does the original, and that in itself is a great achievement considering that most sequels do suck.

I'm a big Indiana Jones fan and I really thought that this movie really captured the same action/adventure/comedy that you get in the Indiana Jones series. Granted, the Indiana Jones series is in a class by itself.  From the opening sequence involving the Scorpion King, all the way to the final battle at the end (special effects a bit cheesy but fits the movie well), I was not disappointed.  All the characters do a good job with over-the-top performances.  It's not an oscar caliber film and not intended so.

619,thesmartass,A good movie but Indy deliver's the real goods...,5,25 November 2001,"This movie is good, but it's rather lame in trying to be a sequel.  Fraser's new wife obviously had implants, and their bratty little son makes me want to scream ""What kind of parents are you people!!??"".  In the first Mummy flick Im-ho-tep is carried off to the afterlife by ghosts or something, but appears in this movie at first as a big lump of frozen sap.  The same can be said for Anuksu-whatever.  She was drowned in the pool of tar but looks like she could be Miss January.  Theres some good acting from the desert man, who was also hilarious as Antoine from Deuce Bigalow.  But since when did little black people pilot blimps?  No offense, but weren't they slaves and tribal warriors back then?!!  This movie tries to cloud the truth with big words and the mysteries of Ancient Egypt.  Overall I'm being nice giving this movie a 5/10, but if you want a real adventure flick catch Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  5/10",The Mummy Returns
620,ScattyCat,What fun!,10,3 January 2002,I loved 'The Mummy' and I wasn't disappointed with 'The Mummy Returns'. The film is easy viewing and fun. It isn't intended to be a great masterpiece. As ever the special effects were good and the humour lighthearted.,The Mummy Returns

Couldn't even be bothered to count the bl**dy number of sides on a pyramid. Some other classic scenes were aboard the 'dirigible': a wooden flying boat on which they have decided to light a fire. If that wasn't stupid enough, they are presumably supposed to be using Hydrogen as a lifting gas (given the tiny size of the canopy) so why not light a fire underneath it?! It gets better though! Once they have lost the 'gas' they mysteriously manage to get the same canopy flying again using hot air. Who cares about the laws of physics? Not these guys...An awful movie. Thanks goodness I taped it and therefore could fast-forward thought the worst bits. Only took me 1/2 an hour to watch!",The Mummy Returns

I love reading about them. I watched all the Mummy movies with Branden Fraiser in it. For some odd reason, the second always had my vote. Every time it comes on the television i would always watch it. It kind of reminds me of Indiana Jones. I love things that uses clues. I also love mysteries and puzzles. Every time it comes on my family always leave me in the room that i'm watching it in. They say that i am weird. My favorite characters are the Majai,Imhotep,Anck-Sunamun,Rick,and Evelyn. I love how they acted. They certainly had the right people playing their roles. I loved the graphics. Overall, This movie is a 10!",The Mummy Returns
623,calummatheson26,A step up !,6,27 August 2012,"This film is rather old but I thought I would still throw in my opinion in case others haven't seen it. The first film was a great action packed thrill ride with a few horror elements thrown in. But that was just the start, this film comes along and smashes that one away. Production value was clearly increased, the incorporation of family problems was great, great settings, great plot/characters. However there is one thing I would like to pick up on, I don't like the fact that the Scorpion King was an actual scorpion, The animation of the face and body was badly done and I was waiting throughout the film to see an epic sword/fist fight at the end, but when I saw him, I was like ""oh..."" It would have been way better to put the Rock back in and when we saw him die at the start he was human.....anyway, a must see in my opinion :)",The Mummy Returns
624,soul_fang,A Thrilling non-stop action ride,10,20 December 2004,"The Mummy Returns is a classic sequel to the first movie. The movie grabs your hold from the beginning and doesn't let go. You will be left gawking at the screen. The special effects are awesome, even better than the first movie. Mummy, Anbus's army and the scorpion king are all masterfully displayed. The cast acting was awesome as usual. Brendan Fraser and Rachel did superb acting of their role, and let's not forget John who played Johnathan providing humor even in the darkest places. The movie is masterfully directed. Action and adventure are present and capture attention. Also, the director has done a beautiful job of bringing humor into the film. The movie will make you laugh, cry and keep gawking at the movie.Overall, I for one, highly recommend this movie. **** out of ****! A must watch!",The Mummy Returns
625,IntoTheAirwaves17,Great Movie!!!,9,8 July 2005,"This was a great movie that I think is better than the first but then again, you can't beat the original right? I loved The Mummy but what I love even more is how the characters develop 10 years later. There is a lot of VFX but if you listen to the commentary you will find some reasons as to why some of the places were created in VFX (mostly because in the back of most of these cities are skyscrapers).Again, Imhotep is brought back as the main villain but the Scorpion King is also brought into the plot which makes it a little more interesting by putting more depth into the story and having Imhotep fear him. Our good guys, the O'Connells are also mixed in a little more by making this story personal with the kidnapping of their son, Alex.Imhotep is still pretty much the same character as was before but now Anack-Su-Namun is in this movie a lot more which makes him be kind of protective of her. Anack-Su-Namun is now obviously more than a CG animation undead mummy, she is now reincarnated but only in body as Meela. Imhotep soon brings her soul back from the underworld though. Evy has also had more depth because we learn that she and Rick are more connected to the story than we thought. Evy is a reincarnated princess and Rick is apparently a Madjai. Evy has also changed from being the librarian for the Cario Museum to an archaeologist who in Racel Weisz's words ""hooked on adrenaline"". Johnathon is well, still the same old Johnathon.The acting and portrayal of all of the characters was done very well. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz both did a fantastic job portraying their characters. You could see that together they had great chemistry and also they did well in developing but somehow keeping the same characters that we know. Rachel had to change Evy into more of an included person in the action sequences and show how much 10 years changed Evelyn. Brendan had to basically keep his same character from before and also develop him just a little like make him more into the dad type character, which he did very well with. Overall I think The Mummy Returns is a great movie to watch over and over with friends, family or whomever else you choose.",The Mummy Returns
626,Twilly,Big disappointment. Lacked wit and storyline of previous movie.,5,20 May 2001,"After throughly enjoying ""The Mummy"" I was disappointed at the lack of wit and plot development in the sequel.  The ""wit"" was forced and the sequel became more of a martial arts movie than anything else.  It seemed I was never ""surprised"" by the plot and virtually each step was predictable.",The Mummy Returns
627,FunkyDung,None of the original's charm,5,18 May 2001,"I am at a loss as to why this movie is doing so well.  I haven't been this upset at public taste since Titanic *shudder*.  I loved The Mummy.  It had lots of charm and cheesy appeal.  To me it was Army of Darkness (a personal favorite) with a bigger budget.  The sequel is pathetic.  If it weren't for the humor (which is the only spectacular element in the film), I'd have rated it as a 3.  The CGI effects looked no better than those in the the original.  In the time between the films, computer animation has grown by leaps and bounds, but it's impossible to tell from The Mummy Returns. These improvements can be seen in the differences between Toy Story and its sequel.  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I saw the animated version of the Rock as a scorpion.  It brought new meaning to the word ""suck"".  AND THAT'S JUST THE EFFECTS!  The plot was nonexistent, the characters were cardboard, and the action sequences (the only things keeping the film going) were contrived.  I strongly suggest you rent this movie and save a few bucks.",The Mummy Returns
628,jonlewis,I think a bunch of college freshmen made this movie!!!,2,5 May 2001,"This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have have ever seen.  In all truthfulness, the script was like something to come out of a high school junior's pen.  The graphics were horrible.  I have seen better animation in video games and the Scorpion King animation reminded me of something out of the old Sinbad movies.  No knock on Sinbad but this movie has every advantage and squandered them.  It was obviously an attempt by a big movie studio to make a quick buck before the looming writers' strike (which, thankfully, didn't happen).  The only redeeming quality of this movie was the sound.  It was second to none but sound alone cannot make a movie.  I loved the first movie in the series but this one was a total bomb.  Bad show and the people who made it should be ashamed of themselves.",The Mummy Returns
629,zamcat,This movie should be held in derision.,3,21 July 2001,"I cannot believe that there are those that believe this movie is better than the first.  This movie pales in comparison.  The special effects are done well (with the exception of the Scorpion King's phony appearance), but unfortunately this seems to be the only element of the film that lives up to the original.The Mummy Returns endeavors to include witty comic relief, like that of its predecessor, but fails miserably in its attempt.  The humor is forced and is used all too often.  Sure there are a lot of laughs in this film, however they come unintentionally from the ridiculous story and outlandish elements of the film (I particularly found the balloon they traveled in hilarious). Romantic scenes are inserted in the same way and just feel out of place. Of course, the gesture to kiss is the cue for the next action sequence, every time.A big mistake was involving a son as part of the family.  Though his acting was decent the character was just annoying.  Being eight years old many of his reactions to situations were unrealistic, for instance he smart mouthed to people that could have easily killed him.  The scenes where he was creating sand models so that he could be followed was laughable.  Why didn't he just write the location of where to go instead of creating miniature sculptures of the places?  He can read ancient Egyptian but he couldn't think to just write the names of the places-smarter than his mother indeed.Following a movie that was for the most part very good, it is too bad that this film was not better made.  Stay away from this one. */****",The Mummy Returns

It didn't have the suspense of the first one, and I agree with all the people who said that there was just a bit too much CGI.  Although I give the writer a thumbs up for actually having this couple stay together from one film to the next, rather than have then split up between the two films and meet up again the the sequel, there was something about the romantic tension between the leads in the first film.  The first film was incorporated nicely, although a bit cheesy at times.  Overall, a good film, just don't expect perfection.",The Mummy Returns

633,Gvorn,And so it begins....,7,4 May 2001,"Every year, around this time, I always start to get a little giddy.  I'm always so excited to see summer roll around, so I can watch those guys at ILM have their fun, trying to outdo what they did last go round.  Each year, summer movies seem to get more and more computerized, and less entertaining. After watching The Mummy Returns, I feel the trend will continue.  Make no mistake, the film is an action ride from beginning to end, but not once is it truly a FUN ride.   I was really pumped to see this film.  I mean REALLY pumped.  I don't even know why.  Granted, I liked the first Mummy film, but not that much.  All I talked about for the past two weeks was seeing this movie.  I don't even know why...I just did.  My friend even made some off color sexual remarks about the Mummy and I.  Yes, it was that bad.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised I was disappointed.  I had it coming.What hurt the film the most was too much action.  I love thrills and chills and yadda yadda...but it was too much.  The film had formula written all over it. Too many characters, too little development, jumping from one death defying circumstance to another.  The CGI was good, but way overdone.  I miss the days where characters actually got the chance to interact with one another.  So darn much of the film felt incredibly fake.  It was more like watching a video game.  Apparently, they forgot to actually write the thing. I got a feeling Sommers and crew just sat around thinking of things that would LOOK cool in a movie.  I think some of the ideas were jokes that somehow got scripted in by accident.  Some of it worked great, but other scenes just made me want to laugh...and not when I was supposed to, either. Granted, the film is supposed to be a comic book fantasy film, but we're not idiots.  We won't watch anything.  Then again, I was there day one and many were there with me...so maybe we will.As far as the cast goes, I can't really blame them.  Each did their job and did it well.  It was good to see everyone back for a second go round, and I still like the characters.  Fraser, Weisz, Hannah, and Fehr did a great job. Freddie Boath didn't grate my nerves like I thought he would (*cough-Jake LLoyd-cough*) and was actually pretty funny.  BUT...the Scorpion King, portrayed by The Rock. WHAT?!?  What is the big deal?  How can ""Hollywood"" determine if this guy is the next big action star...he's in the film for all of 5 minutes, and had like three lines of gibberish?  I mean, I'll give the guy a chance, but to give him a prequel based on his performance here is just silly.  So, even as I bash the film, it filled the time and I am in total LOVE with Patricia Velazquez, so I'd give it a 7 out of 10.  Yeah, I'm a bit of a hypocrite, so what?  $7 bucks isn't too much to pay for a couple hours of watching the most beautiful female on the planet.",The Mummy Returns
634,Adam_Hogan,Bad beyond belief.,3,12 May 2001,"The first Mummy movie was an OK popcorn flick, so my expectations for the Mummy Returns were quite low. I saw that it was rating better than the original on the IMDB so I thought it might just be worth checking out. Nothing could prepare me for how dismal this sequel turned out to be.You don't care about the characters and therefore there is absolutely no suspense. The plot is a mess. In fact it is so bad I couldn't help but laugh in all the wrong places. While finally the introduction of a cute child character in a sequel is never a good sign. The film could almost be retitled ""Home Alone with the Mummy"".Check out the Indiana Jones Trilogy instead. 3/10",The Mummy Returns

636,tucson82,Disappointing,3,14 May 2001,"When ""The Mummy"" came out a few years ago, I had no expectations for it whatsoever and ended up loving it! The plot, the hokey dialogue, the stereotypical characters and the special effects all added up to a great old time. It was reminiscent of Indiana Jones without copying it.I wish they would have followed the formula for ""The Mummy Returns"". I *wanted* to love this film, yet found myself looking at my watch about 45 minutes into it. The CGI was all over the place, but alot of it was sub-par in my estimation, especially the Scorpion King at the end and some of the flat matte paintings. Effects won out over screenplay, plot and substance.I will watch ""The Mummy"" over and over again; this one I'll skip. I won't be buying a copy for my library.Rating: 3/10",The Mummy Returns
637,larshoff,They sure were in a hurry to finish this movie,7,1 June 2001,"The movie in itself is satisfying. Lots of action and some pretty spectacular special effects. The storyline was obviously built to support the visual effects, instead of being the visual effects supporting the storyline. Allright! My kind'a movie! At times in the movie, it was obvious that a little more money (and a lot more of time) would have done wonders to some of the effects. f.ex. the Scorpion kind had almost no facial texture, and was generally not wery well made. Also they had to fix Imhotep (i.e. make him less mummy and more human) quite early in the movie, which was obviously done to save resources. the ending was especially affected by this fenomeno. The death of Anck-Su-Namun was kind of weak, especially since she had a lot more screen-time than in the first movie. At some point the movie also got a little too ridiculous. Everybody seemed to be the reincarnation of some hero/mistress/seer/whatever. Anyway, its worth watching and if they ever send out a Mummy-pack DVD I'll be the first one to by it, being a huge FX fan.",The Mummy Returns

Of course it dosent hurt that there is a fantastic cast including Brendan Fraiser (and despite what any one might say about his previous films, Brendan's acting is fantastic) and the stunningly beautiful (and extremly talented) Rachel Weisz. Not only doese the Mummy Returns have woulderfull specal effects and non-stop action sequances, but it also has a (supprisingly) good plot. One of the things i love about it the most, though, is the witty humor that is present through out.

Go see this movie NOW!While the first movie was, to put it nicely, less than stellar, the second incarnation more than adequately makes up for the failures incurred by its predecessor.  The much-hyped appearance of The Rock (Dwayne Johnson to those who don't recognize him from the WWF) does not exactly dominate the movie as one would expect, but when his character, the Scorpion King, does lend a nice presence to the film.  As this is his silver screen debut, I was expecting sub-par acting, only to find he actually did the job quite nicely. Brendan Fraser reprises his starring role, supported by Rachel Weisz, Oded Fehr, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, who were all in the first movie.  More of the movie is dedicated to the underlying story from ""The Mummy,"" which helps to somewhat improve the first movie in a post mortem kind of way. The special effects are greatly enhanced from the original, but there are also some completely new effects that lend the movie a great supernatural flair.

More of the same.  More special effects, more action, less plot, and alot more laughs.  I was not disappointedI can appreciate any sequel that shamelessly makes fun of the original. Two scenes in particular are taken directly from the original.  Same lines and everything.I can also appreciate a movie that refuses to take itself seriously.  The movie knows it's not a shining example of filmmaking masterpiece.  It revels in it.And finally, I can appreciate any movie that makes fun of so many other movies.  There were a number of Matrix-ish style moves, and the showdown between O'Connel and Imotep just screamed ""PHANTOM MENACE.""  There was alot of Indiana Jones...and I near died laughing when Rick and Evie were standing on the bow of the balloon-ship, (which I also don't understand.) Titanic, anyone?  And there was also the part with them running down a narrow hallway ahead of a torrent of rushing water.I could be wrong, but anyone who has ever played the computer game Diablo 2, by Blizzard Entertainment will swear that the little blowgun pygmy creatures, the creatures in the dark army, and the Rock-Scorpion king all have very obvious counter-parts in the game.I also enjoyed how the producers were able to get around The Rock's utter lack of acting talent by casting him in a role that does not require him to act.  Gotta love it.In short, this movie is not one that will go down as one of the great movies in history.

The scenery and the fight scenes between opposing armies are spectacular and the special effects are quite outstanding. A great cast (Brendan Frasier is excellent in his 'Mummy' roles) does a very good job with a story which I felt tended to 'reach' for surprises a little at times. The jokes were, at times, a little thin and came just short of waggling the eyebrows to highlight a punchline. If a thrill-a-minute movie is what you are after then this is a movie that should be high on your list of must-sees but I do tend to prefer a movie with a little more substance. This is definitely a movie I would see again, if only for the special effects.",The Mummy Returns
652,JBZEPPELIN,Uninteresting sequel,5,19 May 2001,"Not so good sequel, that deserves attention only for it's excellent special effects and action. Otherwise uninteresting with a lame script. Over-hyped due to the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) appearing within, and only for about 2 minutes at the start. At the end, he is poorly animated as a big scorpion. Includes joinings with the original that would only be interesting for those who have watched the original. Some parts are unexplained like Rachel Weisz's flashbacks which did not appear in the first. Uses too many gimmicks for quick one-liners. Only watchable due to the action, but those baddies just aren't bad enough.",The Mummy Returns
653,Cat-i,Guess what. The Mummy returns.,8,25 May 2001,"So here's the sequel to 1999's 'The Mummy'. I think that's the standard way to start a sequel review, but if you really needed me to tell you that, then get off-line, cancel your plans for the weekend, and rent the video of the first one!'The Mummy Returns' is exactly what it says on the tin. The Mummy returns. Chaos ensues. It has everything you'd expect from a thoroughly well-made sequel to a great action film - stunning effects, fantastic stunts, some nifty martial arts, just a dash of comedy to taste, and lots of improbable turns. And lots of creepy crawlies. The only thing that could possibly improve on this romp of a film is some attempt at a plot.The film is straight from the same mould as its predecessor - file under 'Excellent Mong-Out Adventure Film Entertainment' - totally mindless, totally enjoyable, from beginning to end. Hurray for dumbing down! Brendan Fraser perfects the unsubtle-but-lovable-American act and Rachel Weisz is ideal as his squealy-girly English wife, while being feisty enough to keep the character clear of slap-able uselessness. Their kid (Freddie Boath) is suprisingly tolerable (given my cynically low acceptance threshold for precocious kids in films) - amusingly gobby, and yet rarely crossing the boundary into irredeemable obnoxiousness. John Hannah is a bit pitiful playing the wet Englishman part. It should have been good, it's almost fantastic - it's a great role, well written, very capably acted, if a bit overplayed - but it all seems such an insult to his lovely Scottish accent. Patricia Velazquez as Anck-Su-Namun is frankly astounding. I could go on to commend the excellent roles of Lock-Nah (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Izzy (Shaun Parkes) and The Scorpion King (The Rock), in similar glowing terms, but this could get boring.And, well, I've saved the best till last. The nominees for sexiest man on the planet are........ both in the same film? Impressive! We get to see much more (wahey!) of the rather tasty Oded Fehr, as the dark and enigmatic Ardeth Bey, but he's pipped to the post by the delicious Arnold Vosloo, as Imhotep, who we get to see plenty of too. Really, lots and lots of him. And he doesn't have beetles in his head this time. Mmm-mmm. That evil undead charisma wins me over every time.",The Mummy Returns
654,stelittler,"A big effects movie, with poor effects",2,27 May 2001,"The Mummy Returns, what a load of rubbish. For a start, the cast, could they not have ditched the hugely annoying, massively wooden Brendan Fraser, has he ever acted well, or delivered a decent line, I think not. The woman was OK and the Kid, yuk, It sickens me. However apart from the awful script and the hideous acting, there is the effects. Admittedly, some of the effects on the main baddy character are quite nice, and the pyramids are ok, but when a film is billed as a effects movie, you expect some nice effects. The waterfall effects were awful, it looked like a 2 frame bitmap image! The army fight scenes, some of the scorpian arm were simply pasted on to the top of the battle scene so it looks like they were on top of the other people. The so called river Nile outside the pyramid, it was two totally separate scrolling images running past each other with no attempt at intergrating them, and and..... the list goes on, and don't get me started on the bloody hot air balloon....",The Mummy Returns

First of all, The Rock (Dwanye Johnson) didn't do any of the wrestling faces, moves, or sayings which would cheez it up. Second, Brendon Fraser attemped to be funny, and the audience kinda got it, but not really. Third, the special effects were great, better than the orginal. (except for the Scorpion King in the final scene. BAD!) Finally, the story tying in the first movie, and kinda answering a few question.An amount of problems though. Next to the kid that played Alex, none of the actors were spectaculer. Second, the story was too unbelieveable, and didn't really make sense.

Exciting action scenes, cool special effects, decent acting, cool story....the only people who won't like this movie are the people who shouldn't see movies like this in the first place.The first Mummy was pleasant, but a little too slight and jokey for my taste. This movie isn't particularly darker, but the fight scenes are much more kick-@ss (if a little too Matrix-inspired), and the story just feels more solid and involving than the first one. Granted, there isn't that much character development, but you'll still find yourself caring about the good guys, and even the bad guys as well.My only complaint would be the over-hyping of The Rock. He was only in it for about 2 minutes, and didn't have any dialogue!!! Why cast one of the great speech-makers of our time and have him not say anything!?!But all in all, this movie did what The PHANTOM MENACE should have done - provide fun, rabble-rousing, rip-roaring entertainment from beginning to end.",The Mummy Returns
659,NinersWR80,WORST SEQUEL EVER !!!,2,4 May 2001,"The Mummy Returns was extremely disappointing, the original was by far better. The sequel was nothing more than a weak carbon copy of the first movie with an even less believable story line. I do like the actors and the characters in the movie, but the plot and story needed MUCH more work.  My impression was that they tried to get the movie out in theaters so fast that they didn't put much thought into the story.  You can put all the big names and special effects in a movie, but the story is the backbone and will be by what the movie is judged. Save your money and rent it at the video store.
Grade: C- (at best)",The Mummy Returns
660,CactusKind,This one should have stayed buried,3,4 May 2001,"To start off, let me just say that I was a HUGE fan of the first film.  It was smart, funny, and action packed.  Unquestionably one of the best films in the genre since they stopped making Indiana Jones flicks.  The Mummy Returns, while containing wall to wall action and some definitely cool fight sequences, lacks the feel of the original.  The movie tries desperately to recapture the fun of the original, and falls miserably on it's face.  I remember the first movie being very funny, and never taking itself too seriously.  I laughed probably 3 times in this movie, and the rest of the jokes were incredibly corny 1 liners that no one in the theater over the age of 12 laughed at.  I'm not gonna blame it on the kid, like many others are doing, because there is far more wrong with this movie than him.  In fact, I'm not going to blame it on any of the actors.  I usually really like Brendan Fraser (And if I liked Dudley Do-Right, I'll like him in anything) but he really didn't have much to work with here.  And if you're a WWF fan going to see the movie debut of the Rock, then do yourself a favor and get up and leave 10 minutes into the movie, because he doesn't come back (The character does at the end, but he's completely computer generated). The film just goes from one ridiculously unbelievable adventure to the next, no time to breathe, no time to actually stop and develop the story into something remotely interesting.  This movie was obviously rushed into production from the moment the first film became a hit, and if they had just taken half as much time polishing the script as they did filling it up with special effects (varying in range from spectacular to extremely fake looking) then it would have been a much better film.  As it stands, it's little more than two hours of pretty scenery, with not much else to keep your interest. Grade: C-",The Mummy Returns

You didn't have the typical love-hate relationship mumbo-jumbo that was present in the first. The fighting, however, was so frequent that the scenes got older than the mummies themselves. Not that I'm opposed to fighting scenes, but I don't want that to occupy the whole story-line.All in all, I recommend this film for home viewing. It's worth a view, but not the cost of seeing it in theaters. The special fx are incredible, but not the acting. Think of it as an expensive B-movie thriller. And don't forget the popcorn!",The Mummy Returns
664,surlymel,Remarkable only for the amount of 3D effects thrown at the screen.,1,7 May 2001,"This movie is unremarkable except for the amount of 3D effects which are thrown at the audience. I went to the film with very low expectations, expecting a fun-but-dumb action movie - and was very disappointed. There are so many action sequences lined up (one after the other) that the whole thing feels like an amusement park ride and not much else. It seems as if the camera/directing crew ran about shooting a whole bagload of sequences, and then tried to cram all the effects they could back into each one until they felt ""right"" or good enough to splice together to present in theaters. I think I even saw a scene with one of the extras in the background, trying to run off camera. As for the Egyptian theme of the work: there was one authentic-looking box which contained the stylistically strange ""scorpion bracer,"" and there was an outdoor shot of Abu Simbel which looked very nice but was an obvious model. That's about it for accuracy. Everything else is either a hodge-podge of other historic styles, or has a lumpy we-had-a-tatoo-artist-design-this look to it. Watch Indy Jones again if you want a great adventure film, or even Karloff's Mummy - it would be a better use of your time.",The Mummy Returns

667,ora-fanning,Not perfect but...,9,11 May 2001,"not a bad way to spend a hot afternoon and worth the $5 matinee ticket. I went to see The Mummy Returns with no other expectations other than to be entertained. If you know anything at all about ancient Egypt (4 canopic jars, not 5!) check it at the door or watch the History Channel. If the pharoahs would have had 1 ounce of the powers in The Mummy/Mummy Returns, do you think they would have been conquered  by the Hittites and Romans?On the minus side, I missed Beni. Where did all those waterfalls come from in the oasis? The ballon sequence was a bit too long and more unbelievable than the rest of the film. It didn't matter one way or another how long the Rock was in it, I'm not a wrestling fan. Evies fate was pretty predictable also. Sometimes the CGI was a little fuzzy (same with Star Wars, Episode I) Oh, and the idiot who sat behind us, who felt the need to repeat every line, just in case we missed it the first time.Plus side? Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) did exactly what I thought she would. She did a lot of gestures, grimaces, etc., in the course of the film indicating she wasn't exactly a stand by your man kind of girl. Oded Fehr and John Hannah where back. Arnold Vasloo, still a great bad guy. Freddie Boath had a wonderful quality of being intelligent and adventuresome, without losing the fact that he was still a kid. And can that kid build sand castles? And as my teenage daughter would say ""Brendon Fraser, what's not to like?"".All in all, it wasn't all that bad. I recall the second Lethal Weapon and Indiana Jones being worse than the third films in those series. So maybe the 3rd Mummy will be even better.",The Mummy Returns

669,citizen-a,The Best Worst Summer Movie,1,11 May 2001,"I had the unfortunate opportunity to view this movie on opening night. I did see the original, and let me say...this one was much, much worse. In trying to top the first film, Summers over shoots his goal, landing in an ugly bog of horrible special effects, bad one liners, predictable plot turns, character inconsistency, and continuity errors abound. It had a great start, but after the first 30 minutes were over I just felt, well, queasy. Most of the acting was decent, but some very yuck-yuck moments ruined it.I recommend this film to anyone who has: a small child, a cell phone, or money to burn.If Summers had scaled down the ""epic"" story line, I think he could have had more money to support the special effects.

It is your typical summer movie -- not heavy on the social commentary, but a two-hour ""check your brain at the door, sit back, and don't read too much into everything"" movie.  And let's face it -- isn't that what most of us enjoy about movies in the first place?All the lead players are back and they all do a fine job.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz make quite an adorable couple.  Unfortunately, John Hannah really is not a major player in this film, which is rather sad.  He was one of the reasons why the first one was so much fun.  Arnold Vosloo is still a menacing presence; and this time around Patricia Velasquez gets a bigger part.",The Mummy Returns

I was initially put off from the original Mummy, thinking that it was a horror flick, but after hearing more about it, I realized that it was more of a 30's action-wrapped-in-a-comedy film. The sequel follows the same basic recipe, but throws in a dash of The Rock and a few more strange creatures to add a little spice. The graphics were a visual amusement park that I had a blast riding. Plus, it was kind of nice seeing an American movie that had some Arabs as good guys in it- they weren't the only ones or even the main ones- but it was a refreshing change.

At times I would even compare the graphics to that of a cartoon, which made them seem all the more out of place.

The computer generated sets were so obvious, I don't know why they bothered.My advice - go and rent Indiana Jones on video; sure you'll know what's going to happen next, but you'll enjoy the experience far more than seeing this drivel for the first time.My rating 2 out 10.",The Mummy Returns

Lots of things happen without being able to tell us why. There were some unnecessary things. Why were the pygmies added? It was nonsense. The funniest thing-though it did not make me laugh-was that Eve was Nefertiti! The best thing about this movie was Oded Fehr and John Hannah. They make the movie worth watching.

682,MarcusCicero31,Good sequel,7,24 May 2001,"First of all I want to mention that I´m a fifteen year old Austrian so my English is not the best one or very poor.What´s to say about the Mummy returns? Nice sequel. Of course not as good as the original film but not too bad at all. The plot was quite disappointing. One action scene followed another. The mystical,calm parts of the first film which I very estimated are almost removed except a few romantic scenes. I also missed the good old British humor of John Hannah. In my opinion is the Mummy returns more Fantasy than it is Horror. On the other hand the battle between the Madjai and the Army of Anubis and the duel between Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez make the film worth seeing. Besides, I think that Miss.Weisz was more adventurer than the mother of an eight year old boy, which does not mean that she is a bad actress. - By the way I´d say that Rachel Weisz is one the most beautiful, lovely and attractive woman in Hollywood  ;) - What a pity that beauty and charm don´t make a good film. Oded Fehr was in contrast to some special effects (the appearance of the Rock or when the whole jungle disappeared into the Golden Pyramid) brilliant in his role as the commander of the Madjai armed whether with his sword or with the Thompson.  *Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta!* As well as Ardeth Bay was Arnoldo Vosloo as Imhotep who showed more emotions than in the original film.

685,Zentegu,I didn't think that the second part could be this good...,10,25 May 2001,"Hello everyone, (Please read what I wrote about ODED FEHR at the end)Indeed I was waiting a lot for this film. But don't think that I am a fan or something. I always try to decide wisely. And this film didn't disappoint me. I like Brendan Fraser. He is capable of a lot. He acts great. If he keeps up this way, he will probably be a superstar. Indeed this films seems to be made him a superstar already...Anyways back to the film. I have heard about Stephen Sommers but nothing specific was in my mind about him. I mean there are lots of directors around and you know something in particular about each one. I can say that this is a great second part for The Mummy. He wrote a great script and a story. I thought that I would be disappointed by this film but on the contrary I like it a lot.I have to say that I didn't like the visual effects a lot. There are lots and lots of visual effects in the film but especially as we approach the end of the film the quality of the effects decreases. I think the effects guys were tired of making effects and as they come closer to the conclusion they didn't pay attention a lot.What I liked the most is something we don't see in the movies a lot. Everything collapses at the end and the good guys can't even have a proof or money or anything after all they do. In the first movie they able to take some treasure. And in this one too. I liked that. Why are the directors or the scenarists are afraid that the heroes will get rich? Are they afraid that they would feel sluggish and get out of form so that it would be harder to film the next movie with fat heroes? The small creatures were also very funny and creepy and scary. I appreciate the guy who created the model.And above all ODED FEHR. I liked him and the character a lot. He didn't make so much films but the character in this film and himself are in harmony. The best character of the movie is Ardeth I think. The Madji (I don't how to spell it) are very cool. Especially he is very cool. They fight great and never give up. You can always count on them.

The plot elements (what little of them there were) I found contrived... my husband and I were actually laughing out loud at parts we can only presume the director intended not to be humorous (as were others in the movie theater).I was rooting for the Mummy (Vosloo) to ""eat"" the protagonists (excepting Oded Fehr), unfortunately ""Rick"" and ""Evy"" were simply too two-dimensional to make a decent meal....  For me the best part of the movie was the fight scene at the end...

If you haven't seen it already then you might want to get someone to explain 'The Mummy' to you first, especially about the books of life and death.Other than this the rest of the plot is extremely easy to follow (and predict.) It is an unimaginative plot that Gerry Anderson would have been pleased to put into any of his Thunderbirds, Stingray etc. stories.Although the plot is so basic, the special effects are very good. And some of the jokes are quite funny, although the two archeologists do tend to go into Kate and Leonardo Titanic mode far too regularly. One other thing you can't understand - the pilot is hesitant when he is offered about £1000 to fly them somewhere as he would have nothing to spend it on but is suddenly very keen when he can get his hand on a diamond - what can he spend that on?When I'm in trouble with my dad for going out, he reacts more severely than Jon does when the boy does something that could start the next apocalypse!!!(Oh yeah, the Rock is in it too, for about 3 minutes!)",The Mummy Returns

692,eowr,If I could UN-see it I would,1,18 June 2001,"Rarely do I stumble upon movies that make me feel insulted merely to have seen them. The mummy returns could have been a great movie. The story behind it is decent, the special effects - I must give them that - were awesome. But when it comes to the script and the casting there's a few people in Hollywood that should be arrested. The movie is a perfect example of how a movie that could have been good turns bad through the greed of the movie companies. Children never had a place in movies. Very few have managed to incorporate children into the story line, but not one managed to let a child play a major part without the story be made to suffer. We saw it in Star Wars Episode 1, Jurassic Park and now in the mummy returns. In all these movies the story was made to suffer to make the movie more attractive for children, thus producing more money in ticket and merchandise sales. Now it would be one thing if in fact the movie was targeted for the younger audience (like Jurassic Park). Then I would have nothing bad to say about it. I'm 22 years of age, way too old to watch children's movies. But the movie isn't. With the amount of violence actually there, there's no way it could get around an age 13-rating. And I'll tell you what else, there's a ton of movies targeted for children out there that grownups CAN enjoy! I'm not going to go further into why the child part annoys me so much, I am sure you are all intelligent beings who know exactly what I'm talking about. The child actor in the movie is not the only part that destroyed the movie as a whole. The general theme of the lead actors being literally invulnerable (read: immortal) insults my intelligence as an audience member to the greatest. I'm not normally one that spots movie goofs, but in this one there were a hundred and more. You want to see what a good action movie with this theme should be like, rent Indiana Jones.

We are then transported into 1932, where Evee and her husband have a mischievous little son, Alex. Nearly all characters (including Imhotep, of course) return this time around. After a fast temple-flooding sequence, we are thwarted between set pieces, which include a rampage in a double-decker bus through the streets of London, a house, museum and jungle fight, pygmy mummies, a giant mummy faced tidal wave and an exotic saber (which are actually Chinese) cat fight.

Brendan Fraiser's performance once again as Rick O'Connell was spectacular. Rachel Weiz did an even better job of portraying Evie than in the first film.

Actors Brendan Fraser ""Rick O'Connell"", Rachel Weisz ""Evie"", John Hannah ""Jonathan Carnahan"", Arnold Vosloo ""Imhotep"", Dwayne Johnson, The Rock ""The Scorpion King"", were great in their roles.  They did not over act or under act their roles; this to me is a plus. Stephen Sommers, Director, did a great job of bringing to life the mummy and the sets were so realistic it was uncanny.  The costumes were amazing.I truly enjoyed the film.  I would definitely see it again.",The Mummy Returns
710,halebopp3,Romance makes movie complete,10,2 December 2001,"After seeing ""The Mummy"" in the theaters for the first time two years ago, I knew I would be hooked. I've watched it about twenty times since then, and as many people know, this movie does not get boring or less funny after watching it numerous times, in fact, I think it gets more and more thrilling each time. I began hoping for a sequel to be released, and when I heard that one was in the making, I was relieved that they weren't going to end this great storyline with just one film. When ""The Mummy Returns"" was finally released in theaters, it didn't recieve very many good reviews right away. I was dissapointed because I didn't understand how Stephen Sommers could direct such a great movie classic and then totally botch a promising sequel. I let the reviews get to me and I didn't see the movie while in the theaters. I waited until this past weekend to watch TMR on pay-per-view not expecting much due to the bad reviews, but I soon found out that, boy, were some of those critics wrong.Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. The action, special effects, acting, comedy, and romance were all better than it's prequel in my opinion. The plot was a little confusing, and the Scorpion King graphic at the end looked like the same one used in the video game, but all in all it was an extremely fun and enjoyable movie. I actually found myself watching it three times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight, but I didn't want to ruin it right away.The SFX in TMR were outstanding. The pymies were so amazing, and the Anubis warriors were excellent as well. But, on to the greater aspects of the film. I thought that Jonathan, played by John Hannah, is one of the funniest characters ever, his one-liners are terrific, I was laughing out loud during his lines. Arnold Vosloo is great as the title character, but could have been more like the original, he was not as powerful in this film but was good anyway. Many people disliked Alex O'Connell, played by newcomer Freddie Boath, but I found him to be quite funny and likable. He had many great lines and was sarcastic when the film needed it. He is a cute kid and l hope he will have a good acting career. Oded Fehr is wonderful as Ardeth Bay. He keeps the heroes grounded.Meela/Anck-su-namun, played by Patricia Velasquez has some good scenes, but I found her to be not as great as the rest of the cast. I wasn't really looking forward to seeing The Rock as the Scorpion  King in this film, but he wasn't as bad as I thought, even though he was only it for about three minutes, I would have labled him as an extra. It was all hype for him. My favorite part of ""The Mummy Returns"" was the great chemistry between Brendan Fraser (Rick) and Rachel Weisz (Evie). They looked like an actual couple in this film, unlike other recent movies. This was why I liked this one better than the prequel. A little bit of romance was what was missing from the first 2/3 of ""The Mummy"", and I am so glad it was included much more in this film. Brendan Fraser is very easy on the eyes and he looks like a down-to-earth guy, not like a stereotypical moviestar. I think this is why the two seem so believeable in TMR, they are just two normal people who are still very beautiful people. I am glad they made Evie more attractive in TMR, she deserves to show off her pretty eyes. Rick is great because he is still the same sarcastic, wise-guy, handsome hero, who has all the females in the theater (including myself) drooling and sighing, that he was in the first mummy movie.I hope that they will make another sequel with Fraser, Weisz, Hannah, Vosloo, Fehr, and Boath all included. They can't take out any of these characters without the movie being butchered. I probably won't see ""The Scorpion King"" since Brendan and Rachel, my favorite characters, won't be in it. I know there are many others just like me who love the romance in this film. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action, SFX, comedy, romance, and good clean fun. I would give this movie a 9.9 out of 10 points with the 0.1 being subtracted because it wasn't long enough to really explain the plot in more depth. When it ended, I wished it wasn't over. This goes in my top 5 movies of all time.",The Mummy Returns

712,Snow-20,Satisfying and funny,8,23 February 2002,"After seeing 'The Mummy' in 1999, i was impressed with the plot, characters and special effects. I couldn't wait for the follow up 'The Mummy Returns' and when finally I saw it in the cinema, I was not disappointed. This is an action-packed film which never stops and has very many funny one-liners as well, Arded 'This was my first bus ride' after the fight against the mummies on the bus.SPOILERS:The movie starts with the Scorpion King (played by The Rock) and his army going into battle and being defeated. They are driven into the desert, where one by one they all perish, until the King is the only survivor. He makes a pact with the god Anubis that he will give him his soul if he spares his life. This offer is accepted and from then on, the Scorpion King is a slave to the god Anubis. Meanwhile, Rick and Evie find the bracelet of Anubis which has the power to release the army of Anubis, which could mean the world will be destroyed etc. The mummy Imohteb is resurrected in the British Museum and also in the film is his love Anck-su-namun from the first film who has been reincarnated.All this plus many action sequences such as the bus-ride on the red London bus where Rick nearly gets killed and Arded nearly gets sliced and diced by those oh-so-nasty nails of one of the mummies!I particularly liked the flashback scenes to Ancient Egypt, and was shocked but pleasantly surprised to see how everything fitted in to place like Evie who was Princess Nefertiri, daughter of the Pharoah, and her witnessing the murder of her father by Anck-su-namun and Imohteb. The fight between the two women was especially good, and highlights the rivalry between them. We also find out that Rick is a warrior for God, a Medji, (the same as Arded) from the tattoo/birthmark on his wrist, and obviously he is a reincarnation of the Medji from Ancient Egypt also.The funny lines in the film are classic:Izzy: You're not exactly catching me at my best Evelyn: Oh I'm sure I amAlex on the toilet: Hey, reading material!I burst out laughing at that line of Alex's and especially the look on Lock-Nah's face when Alex says, 'You'll look'Coming to Lock-Nah, this is a good part played by a good actor. He is totally believable, although his hatred of the kid was a little overplayed. I like the scene where he strikes with the knife which lands between Alex's fingers. Alex, 'Wooah. Perfect aim' Lock-Nah, 'What are you talking about? I missed'Evie looks much more stunning in this film, and her character is really likeable. She seems to have come outof her shell a bit more since the first movie. She steals the movie from Rick,although he is funny and suits the part.I really like Oded Fehr who plays Arded, the Medji. He is a quiet hero and should not be forgotten. He could have had more lines. He is brave, relentless in stopping Imohteb/the army of Anubis/world destruction etc and should have had more of a major role.Patricia Velasquez, beautiful girl and its good that she had more screentime than in the Mummy, where she was in it for only the first 10 minutes. Although my only major complaint about the whole movie was the part at the end where the rocks are falling in the pyramid, and Evie goes to save Rick. Imohteb calls out to Anck-su-namun to help him and she runs away without helping him.This breaks his heart and he lets himself be taken to die. Now, before Imohteb had left her to go and face the Scorpion King, she had said, 'No I don't want you to go. I don't want to lose you again' After saying that, (and anyway these guys are MEANT to be together through all time) she wouldn't have left him to die. She would have saved him. so i think that the scriptwriters let themselves down there. They could at least have kept the couples love strong, and maybe they could have died together in the pyramid to be resurrected again one day maybe...Anyway, to sum it all up, this movies great, and I will probably check out the Scorpion King, however it hasn;t got any of the characters from the Mummy films in apart from The Rock. I heard that there was going to be another Mummy film and they would go back in time and it would be about everything that happened in Ancient Egypt which has all the major characters in which sounds amazing but has anyone else heard that?",The Mummy Returns

As a lover of anything Egyptian I get my fill in this movie. Action, romance, Egyptian stuff, repeat. You have to take the movie for what it is and just enjoy it. Starting from the begging the story and action are gripping. The way the movie even pokes fun at itself is brilliant. When Rachel is explaining to Frasier about the Bracelet of Anubis and the Scorpion King, Frasier finishes her sentences by saying ""Let me guess, he wants to wipe out the world"" ""How do you know?"" she asks.

717,LadyPagan,"Inaccurate Egyptology: ""Evil"" god Anubis?!?!?",5,14 December 2006,"As an amateur Egyptian mythologist and Isiac reconstructionist, I have a couple of problems with this movie and it's predecessor, ""The Mummy."" Both were recently played back-to-back on the SciFi channel, so I got a chance to refresh my vague memory of them from several years ago. I watched ""The Mummy,"" and basically enjoyed it as an utter yarn, with one or two nit-picks (Seti I murdered by his high priest? Huh?). The thing that stuck in my craw the most was the bit about the vicious, flesh-eating scarabs. Scarabs are DUNG BEETLES! They eat dung, never live prey. Ever! They may occasionally feast on decayed vegetation and possibly even the rotted flesh of corpses, but they generally prefer the dung of livestock and are, themselves, a favorite snack of Egyptian bats. It was a minor issue and the FX were cool, so I let it slide ... sort of.I was far less forgiving with ""The Mummy Returns,"" which I turned off in disgust after about the first five minutes. The reason? Its portrayal of Anubis as a snarling, ""evil"" and ""dark god"" (I'm quoting words from the movie itself) was offensive and inaccurate, if not outright sacrilege. According to Egyptian mythology, the jackal- or dog-headed god, Anubis, was not and IS not evil, even though his alleged father, Set, might be characterized as such.For those who don't know: Anubis is the Egyptian god of the dead and dying, who protects and ushers the recently deceased into the afterlife, most commonly referred to as the Underworld (not to be confused with Hell, mind you). He is at once ruler, guard and judge of who is fit and deserving to enter the utopian Underworld by a test known as the Weighing of the Heart. (Sort of the Egyptian equivalent of St. Peter.) He was spared from death as an infant by the goddess Isis and remains Her loyal companion and protector (much like the faithful family dog). He is said to have taught the art of mummification and funerary rites to the Egyptians priests. He is also viewed by some as the patron god of lost souls and orphans. Dark? Perhaps, inasmuch as death may be considered dark. But, evil? Absolutely not. And I have come across no tales of Anubis ever having had an ""evil army"" as the ""The Mummy Returns"" portrays being led by the Scorpion King. This notion is so ridiculous it's almost funny. Almost.Either the consultants on this movie did not do their research, or they've watched the original ""The Omen,"" with the skeletons of demonic Damien's jackal-headed parents being unearthed in the Egyptian desert (and the obvious allusion to Anubis), far too many times.In any case, I was turned off by either the sloppy ignorance or the intentional maligning of Egyptian divinity. As others have stated here, there are even errors in the continuity in the timeline and ""historical"" references between the two films themselves, which might shed some light on the reasons for the mistakes in Egyptian mythology.I really wish Hollywood would get its act together when making action, horror or drama movies featuring pagan gods. I tend to get a little testy about how easily the label ""evil"" is applied in such cases. And for every ""DaVinci Code"" and ""Last Temptation of Christ,"" there are about a dozen other films that have served to spread fallacious and pernicious ideas about paganism. And yet, the last I checked, no Christians have had to go into hiding because of a vapid movie twisting the Catholic rite of Communion into a carnal act of cannibalism. And I can't help but be critical when mainstream movies such as this one, mold deities from other cultures into sinister action figures for an audience that may not realize that what they're seeing is a complete lie.Blessings of Isis, Lady P",The Mummy Returns

721,snapshot8d,This is the worst movie I've ever seen...,1,30 March 2005,"OK, maybe not the worst, but it's right up there with Battlefield Earth and Starship Troopers.Did this movie have a director? Stephen Sommers gets the billing, but was he there? Did he see what was being filmed? I think there was a story...somewhere in there. I think there were actors... or they may have been robots programmed to recite lines- that's about as convincing as they appeared. The chemistry between Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz was about as believable as a Barry Bonds press conference. They're relationship was soooo contrived and forced- it was actually painful (really, I was in pain). I'm not a casting director, but when you're casting offspring shouldn't he/she resemble one or both of the parents? (re: Jonathan Carnahan) Imhotep and Acnk Su Namun sounded like they learned the Egytian Language from a free pamphlet at Cairo International Airport. These are just a few things that a director should notice and remedy before innocent people pay good money to watch.I could go on and on and on... but this movie is fatally flawed in so many ways.I think they should've replaced all the star billing with a listing of the special effects crew. They were the real stars of this film. If you want to see some great effects, rent (do not buy) this movie and skip to CGI scenes. They're great.

The special effects are bit overdone and the plot is about as complex as an episode of Mayberry RFD, but that doesn't detract from it's simple 80's action television show values. Although one things my friend and I have noticed that seems to have escaped the notice of the IMDb trivia section, the ending of this movie is a play by play remake of the ending of the Ducktales mummy adventure. 1. Mummy is defeated in the strange desert oasis 2. the defeat of said villain causes said oasis to sink into the desert 3. a daring escape through the pyramid 4. escape culminates on the roof of the pyramid where our heroes are met by the pilot character in a hot air balloon 5. the greedy character reaches back for a large jewel, almost dies due to their greed, only to be pulled back from the brink of disaster by another character 6. happily ever aftereven the sinking of the pyramid into the desert is shot in an identical manner. We even hooked up two TVs and watched them both at the same time. The timing is almost exact, and there are other similarities between the two that are too numerous to mention. I think that ducktales should be added to the references list for this movie.",The Mummy Returns
723,declandeclan,Excellent,9,6 July 2005,"I hate to disagree with nearly everyone else, but this movie was quite good. The special effects were excellent and the story line was very ""Imagative"". Acting was OK, and the characters were all played to there parts.The only main problem was the amount of characters in it, i found it hard to keep up with everyones story and means. The ending surprised me and the laughs in this movie were not avoidable, most of them coming from Jonathon.All in all this was a very good movie, aimed at teenagers. I think it was directed well and the story was planned well. There was only a few plot holes and nearly each scene had a funny or scary surprise. I cant wait for the third Mummy, but for now the second is much better then the third.",The Mummy Returns
