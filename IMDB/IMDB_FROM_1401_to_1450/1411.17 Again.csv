0,MartinHafer,Far better than I could have expected...,8,12 March 2010,"The idea for this film is hardly new. The notion of an adult becoming a teen once again or a teen becoming an adult or a teen going back in time and visiting their parents when they are teens--all are very, very familiar. Films like ""Big"", ""Back to the Future"", ""Like Father Like Son"" are just among the few examples of these sort of films. However, like I once heard a brilliant author say that ""...there are only a limited number of plots--it's what you DO with the plot and characters that matters"". And, she's right--not just because she's my wife!What I liked about ""17 Again"" is that it excels for two main reasons. First, the film is a bit irreverent and I loved the dialog. While parents might want to think twice about the film for younger kids, words like ""douche"" and ""wiener"" are the way kids really talk--I know, as I taught high school. Second, the supporting characters are really good--in particular, the friend of the time-traveling man, Ned is great. He's a wonderfully funny addition to the film and his antics alone make the film worth seeing.The plot finds Matthew Perry a lonely man whose life is falling apart. His wife wants a divorce and he has a terrible relationship with his kids. However, when a bizarre other-worldly janitor (Brian Doyle Murray) puts some sort of magical spell or curse on him, he suddenly become 17 once again. In this new role, he decides to go back to high school and help his kids. It seems that his son is a lonely wimp and his daughter is a bit of a tramp--dating the scum-bag that regularly beats up her brother!!Perry soon finds in his new guise as a 17 year-old (played by teen heart-throb Zac Efron), he's a lot more successful than he was as a father. He manages to be rather cool and a great teenager. He's able to help his son learn about his inner strength and skills--and joins the basketball team. The daughter, on the other hand, is a bit of a problem. She is a slut in training...but also thinks that Efron's attentions means he's great boyfriend material! And, to make things a lot worse, he and his soon to be ex-wife hit it off great...TOO GREAT. It's all rather creepy--but funny at the same time both daughter and mother head over heels in love with him! And, surprisingly, Efron handled the acting part of this quite well.Overall, the film manages to be both entertaining to teens (I watched it with my daughter and as a representative of every teen in America, she loved the film) and adults--my wife and I liked it. It's rare to find a film that is interesting and intelligently written enough to appeal to all age groups. Some parents may object to the language and the portion in the sex ed class, but I thought this was all handled appropriately and responsibly.Far better than I ever expected it could be.",17 Again
1,TheLittleSongbird,Surprisingly not that bad,7,2 August 2010,"I have to admit I am not a big fan of Zac Efron, but I saw 17 Again expecting to hate it but actually it wasn't that bad. Yes, the story is predictable, yes the pacing is uneven and yes the ending is a bit of a letdown.However, there are a lot of redeeming merits. The soundtrack is excellent, and the script is surprisingly decent with just the right amount of quirky humour. The direction is good, while the acting is not bad at all. The characters are a little clichéd admittedly, but the actors do their best to make the most of their characters. Zac Efron gives a great performance in the lead and fits perfectly with the film's tone. Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann are both good too, but it is Efron's film all the way.Overall, not bad actually quite enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",17 Again
2,bkoganbing,From Wildcat To Warrior,7,17 April 2009,"When I went and saw 17 Again and the film opened with Zac Efron in a basketball uniform shooting baskets for a minute I thought I was at High School Musical 4. But in fact it was not a bad comedy/drama in which Efron and Matthew Perry play the same character at different points of their lives.Back in 1989 Zac looked like he had it made, university scholarship for basketball in the offing when girl friend Allison Miller tells him she's pregnant. That takes his head out of the game real fast and the two of course get married.Fast forward to the present and the couple now played by Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann are split and she's filing for divorce. When a young girl who was probably bedding the boss at his job gets a promotion, that tears if for him. Perry makes a wish that he could be young again and have a second chance at life. A very strange janitor who is a guardian angel grants his wish and he's now Zac Efron again, this time in 2009.So like Joe Boyd who became Joe Hardy in Damn Yankees, Perry is now young and Zac Efron again. But he's also bringing 20 years of real life experience to high school and he becomes a guardian angel himself to his two children there, Michelle Trachtenberg and Sterling Knight.Although some compare 17 Again to It's A Wonderful Life, I think it stands better comparison to Damn Yankees and the Faust legend, except that it's a good angel and not the devil that's granting the wish. And of course his soul is no danger.Melora Hardin is around and playing the role of one of the foxiest school principals I've ever seen on film. She's the object of the affection of Thomas Lennon who was the school nerd and Efron's friend, like Screech Powers to Zack Morris. As a kid he's played by Tyler Steelman. Steelman was the school nerd then, but as an adult and Thomas Lennon he's a super rich guy, but still friends with the guy who protected him back in the day.I was expecting a teen sex comedy and I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised with how good 17 Again was. I highly recommend to audiences of all ages. And Zac Efron's fans of all ages.",17 Again
3,SnoopyStyle,Zac Efron winning performance,7,12 October 2013,"Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) was a teen basketball jock with all the potential in the world. When his girlfriend got pregnant, he abandons it all to marry her. Now they're adults, Mike (Matthew Perry) can't stop blaming all his problems on this decision. His wife Scarlet (Leslie Mann) divorces him. Then one night, a guardian angel sends Mike through a vortex and turns him back into a teen again. He decides to go back to high school to relive his high school years, but instead he reconnects with his family.Thomas Lennon does his wacky best friend. It's basically 'Big' in reverse. The story isn't anything new or original. Zac Efron is quite funny as the fish out of water. He's surprisingly great as a compelling lead. It's his performance and his energy that drives this movie. The trick is that he's not playing a teen. He's playing mid-30s in a body of a teen.",17 Again
4,claudio_carvalho,Second Chance in Life,7,16 May 2010,"In 1989, the teenager Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) is the star of the Hayden High-School. On the day of the final basketball game, Mike will be observed and may win a scholarship in college. However, his girlfriend Scarlett (Allison Miller) tells him that she is pregnant and Mike does not play the game. Twenty years later, Mike (Matthew Perry) is a complete loser that blames Scar for his failures: he is not promoted to sale manager after working sixteen years in the same company; Scarlett (Leslie Mann) is divorcing him; his teenagers son Alex (Sterling Knight) and daughter Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) hate him; and he is temporarily living with his best friend, the eccentric and immature millionaire Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon). Mike nostalgically visits Hayden where an old janitor talks to him about second chance in life. During the night, he sees the janitor jumping from a bridge into the river and he unsuccessfully tries to help the man. Mike passes out and when he wakes up, he discovers that he is seventeen again. Further, he discovers that he has a second chance to fix his relationship with his family.""17 Again"" is another good movie about second chance in life. I believe most of people in a certain age question decisions took in the past and would like to have a second chance to re-route his or her life in that milestone. The cinema makes this dream come true and certainly the story is pleasant for most of the people. In addition, the two lead stars (Zac Efron and Matthew Perry) are nice actors and the result is a nice entertainment for whole family. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""17 Outra Vez"" (""17 Again"")",17 Again
5,kosmasp,Not about the names,7,8 August 2010,"I have to admit I wasn't aware of Zac Efron (or his fame) before I watched this movie. I knew Matthew Perry (from Friends), but Zac? Actually I think I'm still not fully aware what kind of an idol he might be to some teenagers at this moment. But it's not about the names. The movie itself is pretty good. You might have seen Leslie Mann before (not only because she's married to a great director), but she has to carry a pretty heavy role here.As do the others. There's themes here that might be borderline for those faint hearted types. But if you can't handle some pressure there, than you might not want to watch this. While this has been done in other similar fashions in movies (Big being one that comes in mind), this still is kinda good (haven't seen Big in a long time, so I can't really compare those movies). Nice teenage movies and a nice watch.",17 Again
6,jboothmillard,17 Again,3,28 June 2013,"I knew about this film primarily because of the leading young star made famous by the High School Musical films, and I had an idea of the premise, I didn't have high hopes for it but I was still willing to give it a go anyway. Basically at age seventeen Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) was on top of the world, as a high school basketball star, with the potential for a college scholarship, and dating his soul mate Scarlet (Allison Miller), but on the day of his final championship game he finds out she is pregnant, so he abandons the game for her. Twenty years pass and thirty seven year old Mike (Matthew Perry) is separated from now wife Scarlet (Leslie Mann) following the regret of leaving the game, and he is forced to living with geeky and wealthy friend Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon), he has a boring job having no real qualifications, and his teenage children Maggie (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Michelle Trachtenberg) and Alex (Sterling Knight) shun him. He has a strange encounter with a mysterious Janitor (Brian Doyle-Murray), and driving on a bridge Mike spots him standing on the ledge looking ready to jump off, so he runs out to stop him but is too late, and looking down to the water he sees someone in the later, and leaning too far he falls into a portal. Waking up Mike looks in the mirror and finds that he has transformed into his seventeen year old self, and following a Star Wars style light sabre fight with Ned he convinces his friend of his identity, and seeing this as a chance to relive his younger days he enrols into his former high school, under the name Mark Gold, i.e. Ned's son. He hopes to become a basketball star once again, and he gets to know the students well in class, but also hopes to get closer to his children, so with Maggie he comforts her following the split from basketball captain boyfriend Stan (Hunter Parrish), and his son Alex he helps go against bullies and find a girlfriend. Through his children Mike also gets to spend more time with his separated wife Scarlet, he cannot resist his desire for her, and he must avoid Maggie making advances, not knowing he is her father, and meanwhile Ned and high school Principal Jane Masterson (Melora Hardin) share a mutual interest in The Lord of the Rings and start having a relationship. As time goes by Mike has realised his decision to abandon the game in the past for Scarlet was the best decision he made, he is unable to convince her of his true identity, but at the court case to finalise the divorce between them he reads out a letter from himself explaining how much he truly loves her. Being curious of him, she halts the divorce proceedings to attend the high school basketball game, Mike notices her and just like the past runs after her in the corridor, and at that moment he transforms back into his adult self, and Scarlet and Mike kiss and reunite, Ned and Jane are officially dating, and Mike becomes the high school basketball coach. Also starring Tyler Steelman as Ned Gold (Teen) and Katerina Graham as Jamie. Efron just like in High school Musical is a bit dull, and it is obvious he was chosen to appeal to the teenage audience, Perry is on too briefly but is likable, as is Mann as the wife, and most of the fun scenes are stolen by lovably nerdy Lennon, this film is basically mixing Big, Freaky Friday, Back to the Future and It's a Wonderful Life all together, the concept is nothing new, and there were only a few funny scenes, so it is overall a bit of a disappointing comedy. Adequate!",17 Again
7,blanche-2,"Very cute, go figure",8,25 April 2009,"I took two teenage girls to see this, and I have to say that we all enjoyed it.Since the time of Charles Dickens and probably before, characters have been going back to their past in one form or another, or seeing the future, or finding out what life would have been like for others if they weren't around. Hollywood isn't the place lately for much besides special effects, remakes, and rehashes. The basis for this story - reliving the past - has been used dozens of times - off the top of my head, ""Repeat Performance"" from 1947, remade as a TV film in 1990, Big, 13 Going on 30, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married, etc.""17 Again"" doesn't break any new ground, but neither is it an embarrassment. In fact, quite the opposite. It's very witty with good acting and good characters. Matthew Perry plays Mike O'Donnell, a father of two who's just lost his job and is about to be divorced. He returns to his old high school and is reliving his glory days, when he blew his chance at a basketball scholarship to college. On the day the scouts were at the school to watch a game, he found out his girlfriend was pregnant and left the game to declare his love for her and propose marriage. While looking at a photo of his old team, he meets a janitor who says he bets Mike would like to be back in high school. Later on, in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" style (I prefer to think of this as an homage rather than a rip-off), Mike sees the janitor jump off of a bridge and jumps in to save him. Mike climbs out of the water, and he's Zac Efron, something I'm sure a lot of both old and young men wish could happen to them. He soon realizes he hasn't been given this gift to re-do his life. He's 17 again for another reason entirely.Efron, Thomas Lennon, Matthew Perry, Michelle Trachtenberg, Melora Hardin, Leslie Mann, and Nicole Sullivan all give excellent performances, with Lennon's character definitely being the showiest and most fun. Because he's young, good-looking, and a Disney star, many people (usually men) dislike Zac Efron on principle and dismiss him as a pretty boy, something that befell a classic star whom he resembles, Tyrone Power (and if you don't think he looks like Power, I direct you to http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3601/3365080372_709edf1dac_o.jpg). Power had a problem getting challenging roles. The heavy duty teen idol type of thing, to which Efron falls victim, came along in the '50s. Efron's road will be tougher, but he has the talent to pull out of the teen idol genre - dropping out of Footloose was a good first step.All in all, good fun. I just wish Hollywood would come up with something a little more original, even if it's only once in a while.",17 Again
8,tavm,17 Again was a pretty enjoyable comedy for teens and some adults,7,21 April 2009,"This is another movie I watched with my friend who works at a movie theatre. With elements of Big and 13 Going on 30, not to mention It's a Wonderful Life and Back to the Future, 17 Again is a pretty enjoyable meshing of those movies considering the cast which has Zac Efron, Michelle Trachtenberg, Leslie Mann, Margaret Cho, Thomas Lennon, and Melora Hardin. I also recognized Matthew Perry and Nicole Sullivan. I did not realize until the cast credits that the bearded janitor at the high school was Brian Doyle-Murray, Bill's brother. Now, parts of the plot and characterizations were a little uneven but despite that there were plenty of scenes that were hilarious especially those between Lennon and Hardin. With them, I also saw a little ""Big Bang Theory"" vibe. Oh, and there's a little touching pro-abstinence speech here as well (though it still is acknowledged that not all teens will feel that way). All in all, despite some adult humor, 17 Again was an enjoyable comedy that should be enjoyable enough for parents and offspring alike. Oh, and one more thing: I thought the Vanilla Ice reference in the 1989 sequence didn't fit since I remember him not even emerging until the following year...",17 Again
9,ComedyFan2010,Pleasantly surprising,7,27 May 2013,"I didn't think I would like this movie and yet I actually really did! First thing that makes one feel a bit reluctant about this movie is the fact that we saw this story hundreds of time. The going back in time/being a teen again stories are very popular. And yes, this one is another of them. Main reason I can't rate it is higher than 7 is because it lacks originality and it is easy to predict what happens and how it ends.Yet, this does not ruin the movie. It has a fresh and funny dialogue and an amazing cast.Actually I would like to apologize to Zac Effron. I never saw a movie with him before and only knew that he is loved by teenage girls. So when I started watching I was ind of resenting the idea that soon Mathew Perry, who is a funny actor, will be replaced by Zac Effron for the most of the movie. Yet, it didn't turn out as a bad thing. He is actually a very good and funny actor. Next time I see that he is in the cast, I will consider it a positive thing.The rest of the cast was great as well, a special mentioning deserves Thomas Lennon whose character Ned made me laugh through the movie.It is a very PG movie. I was very happy about the fact that they didn't make it too cheesy. It had its moments but for the most it is just light entertainment. I am not even the target audience, I think for the most it is appealing to teenagers or parents who miss their school days. I am neither and yet I liked it,so its a well done job.",17 Again
10,wes-connors,You're Only Big Once,5,11 August 2012,"In 1989, handsome muscle-chiseled basketball player Zac Efron (as Michael ""Mike"" O'Donnell) blows the big game when his girlfriend announces a whispered event. Her curiously bad timing changes Mr. Efron's life. Eighteen years later, he has grown into Matthew Perry (still as Mike O'Donnell) and is passed over for a promotion. Dejected, Efron recalls his glory days in high school and wishes he were back there. Thanks to a mysterious janitor, Mr. Perry goes back to being younger self. His long-time millionaire friend Thomas Lennon (as Ned Gold) reacts to the new Efron by trying desperately to kill him...It seems strange that ""Ned"" would not recognize his former friend, but he doesn't look like he'd change into Matthew Perry the way Mr. Lennon looks like he could have grown from Tyler Steelman...The brutal attempted murder ends when Lennon sees a prominently displayed photograph of he and Efron taken when they were young. With Lennon posing as his father, Efron (now as ""Mark Gold"" ) decides to go back to high school and finish the basketball season he messed up 18 years earlier. After remembering his two teenage children are in the same high school, Efron changes his focus to help them. His son Sterling Knight (as Alex), who actually looks like a high school teen, is being duct-taped to the toilet. His daughter Michelle Trachtenberg (as Maggie) is dating blond bully Hunter Parrish (as Stan)...Efron reveals ""Stan"" is a bully because, ""Underneath all of that that male bravado, there's an insecure little girl who's banging on the closet door trying to get out."" Also, he's dumb and not endowed...Becoming friendly with his kids leads Efron to his wife Leslie Mann (as Scarlet), who is waiting for her divorce to become final. She reacts to seeing her newly young husband by roughly pinching and probing his face. Efron's hair doesn't move, but his face appears to be normal. Their later dance lesson is one of the highlights of the film. Efron's first attempt to dress like a teenager, whilst saying ""s'up?"" was hilarious and the scenes with his children are neat. The story, however, often presents events in ways that make you question how or why they are happening. It's difficult to suspend disbelief.***** 17 Again (3/11/09) Burr Steers ~ Zac Efron, Leslie Mann, Thomas Lennon, Matthew Perry",17 Again
11,studioAT,Matthew Perry is 17 again,7,15 June 2010,"Matthew Perry has had an up an down film career but this isn't through lack of effort. The main problem is that in many of his films (which don't get me wrong I really like) he plays a character too similar to his character on the hit sitcom Friends. However here he is takes on a role I doubt anyone could have predicted and does very well in the limited screen time he had. Sure there are flashes of Chandler here but by and large it is a different type of character. This is obviously a vehicle for Zac Efron and everything in this film is centred around him because of this. He proves in 17 again that he can be more than just that kid from High School Musical and can actually act. He is ably supported by Leslie Mann and Thomas Lennon and overall this film is light, funny and entertaining and at times heart warming film that Matthew Perry is a big part of. of this.",17 Again
12,hitchcockthelegend,"It's a classic transformation story. Are you now or have you ever been a Norse God, Vampire, or Time Traveling Cyborg?",7,13 June 2013,"Another in what is a long line of body swap comedies, 17 Again is fun, frothy and full of warmth; just like all the other ones really! There's nothing new here, it's the same old format as a grown up Mike O'Donnell (Matthew Perry) rues how his life has grown to miserable proportions but magically gets to be a high-schooler again and grasp that second chance. Back in his 17 year old bod (Zac Efron looking like a young Rob Lowe), Mike oversees the trials and tribulations of his two kids who attend the same school, whilst also forming a ""special"" bond with his future wife Scarlet (Leslie Mann) who is going to divorce him! Cue much high-school pranks, perils and near misses and a few worthy messages in the narrative.Tailored towards a certain demographic with the casting of Efron, who is very likable and a worthy lead here, the film thankfully doesn't lack for good performances elsewhere. Both Mann and Melora Hardin as the hot principal make their roles stand out, while Thomas Lennon as Mike's uber rich man child buddy steals the movie. It's rich in clichés of the formula and the predictability of outcome robs us of a surprise, but these are not actually irritants, for this is a very enjoyable movie. One where the teens hot for Zac can stare lovingly, and one where the adults can nod in knowing agreement at some plot dynamics. 7/10",17 Again
13,dbborroughs,A very good version of a well worn tale. It helps to have Zac Efron in what is sure to be a cross generational star making performance,7,27 April 2009,Zac Efron stars as a youthened Matthew Perry who is made young again in order to prove to him that being young wasn't as great as he thought and to appreciate what he has. It's a been there and done that plot that's actually done well here. There have been so many variations on this theme that one is tempted to throw up ones hands and say enough. Part of the reason this works is Efron who proves himself to be an amiable and assured screen presence. He's better than most of the Disney packaged actors and actresses to come down the pike who's talent seems to be confined to looking good and staying close to plan. I think Efron will have a long career if he wants to and doesn't do anything stupid. The film is worth a look.,17 Again
14,Calicodreamin,Cute fluff,6,26 January 2021,"A cute enough fluffy movie. Some scenes I could do without, namely the teen girls swooning uncontrollably. However, a fun and fairly unique premise, decent acting, and delivers the warm fuzzy ending required.",17 Again

In fact, George Burns was involved in the very same story in the 1980's only it was called 18 Again. Well, at least Burns was still old enough to get into restricted movies. This movie certainly should be restricted. It should only be shown to inmates as a form of punishment. Matthew Perry plays a frustrated father threatened with divorce due to his inability to proceed past his high school basketball days. Lame story has him fall through a portal and emerge 17 again to learn the obvious that viewers already knew. Where this portal comes from is something the screenwriter never fills us in on. Directed by Burr Steers who does the best he can with the material. Zac Efron goes through the tortured formula as the teen version of Matthew Perry. Speaking of which, the ex Friends star must be proud of this demotion in the acting ranks. Leslie Mann is cardboard as his wife. Thomas Lennon is terrible as his reject science fiction obsessed friend who helps him get enrolled in school. Michelle Trachtenberg plays Perry's daughter and predictable elements follow up. Cheap and virtually bypasses the message to become a vehicle for Efron. Viewers may wish to fall through a portal to before they purchased a ticket. Score: 2 / 10",17 Again
16,Wuchakk,A high school dramedy/body swap flick with heart,8,13 July 2017,"Released in 2009 and directed by Burr Steers, ""17 Again"" stars Matthew Perry as a dispirited 37 year-old man about to lose his wife and high school sweetheart. Through a ""spirit-guide"" (Brian Doyle-Murray) he is miraculously able to become, you guessed it, 17 again. His younger self is played by Zac Efron, who's actually the star of the movie. Leslie Mann plays his soon-to-be former wife while Thomas Lennon appears as his geeky best friend. Sterling Knight & Michelle Trachtenberg are on hand as his kids struggling through the teen years. Melora Hardin plays the attractive principal while Nicole Sullivan has a glorified cameo.This movie is magic from beginning to end, with few missteps. It's both a high school dramedy and a second chance fantasy. There are elements of films like ""Back to the Future"" (1986) and ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" (1986), but the uniqueness here is that the protagonist doesn't go back in time, but rather stays in the current day and appears to his family & friends as 17 years-old, even though he's really 37. With one exception, no one knows who he really is.Efron, who was only 21 during filming, easily carries the film while Mann is one of the most winsome women to walk the Earth. Lennon's amusing character is akin to the Big Bang Theory guys. Best of all, the film has heart, effectively conveying the triumphs and tragedies of the high school experience in all its glory and awkwardness. I know it's clichéd, but ""you'll laugh, you'll cry."" The movie runs 102 minutes and was shot in Santa Monica (Hayden High School), Van Nuys & Los Angeles, California. The script was written by Jason Filardi.GRADE: A-",17 Again
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: 17 Again,6,26 April 2009,"The plot element is nothing new, and we've seen enough of body swaps, or younger folks wishing they can't grow up fast enough, or older ones reminiscing the old days, wondering if a change in decisions then would have resulted in a different life, hopefully for the better, now. However, such formula makes for a good box office reason to continue production, especially when you get to cast the ""It"" person of the moment (think Jennnifer Garner with 13 Going on 30), hitting the new generation with a star from their cohort. So it's yet another Zac Efron vehicle for him to shine in, and he's actually quite good at it, outside of the High School Musical series, about time now.While Efron's star is shining brightly, being able to marquee this film on his own with a relatively low key cast, if you're from my generation then you can't help but to notice how fickle fame can be, and how Matthew Perry, once an integral part of the Friends team, has faded away since the television series bowed out of the tube. He shares the same role of Mike O'Donnell with Efron, playing the older version who's a little grouchier, a tad fatter and was just hoping to relive his past glory days. As proverbial Fate would have it, his wishes are heard, confirmed, and granted.Now most films in the same genre would find the character either doing things they've missed out on, or to make grave changes so that it would impact their personal lives for the better. What I enjoyed about this film was its conscious departure from such a formula after the transformation took place, with an emphasis more on the family rather than the self, that ultimately Mike still has to answer to his estranged wife Scarlett (Leslie Mann), and kids Alex (Sterling Knight) and Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg). Being his kids age again allows for some bonding at their level, with comedic doses coming from forgetting his secret identity and crossing the line in ""nagging"" mode, or seemingly trying to reinforce the notion of his preference for MILFs, and force his daughter's raging hormones off him (he's Zac Efron for crying out loud!)More comedy comes courtesy of Mike's best friend and total nerd Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon), whose unlimited bankroll allows Mike to become the coolest kid on the block with some outrageous toys, and living in a house befitting a nerd king, being littered with collectibles, notably Star Wars. Fanboys will probably have a field day here with multiple instances of Lucas-worship, and especially with the subplot of Ned trying his very best to woo principal Jane Masterson (Melora Hardin) who finds it increasingly hard to stick to her mantra of not dating her student's parents.17 Again is a surprisingly decent flick which has an excellent pop soundtrack to go along. And without a doubt it benefited from the casting of Efron, who will ensure that his legion of female fans will continue to flock to the theatres in show of their support for their idol. They should collectively hope that he will mature with his pretty boy looks and not grow up to look like Chandler Bing (sorry Matt!)",17 Again
18,namashi_1,Hilarious!,7,13 June 2009,"Burr Steers '17 Again' is an out-and-out entertainer, that has all the ingredients to catch your attention, and makes you laugh at the right places. Honestly, it's truly a enjoyable fare. A complete entertainer, that has a sweet story to say. Don't tax your brains, and imagine you being Zac.... I am sure you'll have a blast. The film has a decent script, and the director has made the film with complete honesty. In fact, the entire crew has done a great job... they seem to be having a blast while making this fare. '17 Again' caters to all ages... 8 to 80.... a thorough entertainer! Performances: Zac Efron is a euphoria among the youth, the high school musical films have made him a shining star.... but after watching '17 Again', he gets another feather in his cap, that being a very good actor. He's natural throughout and carries the film on his shoulders. He is simply superb in the courtroom scene, where he reads out a letter to his wife. Splendid! Matthew Perry in likable is a cameo. Thomas lennon is fantastic, he's hilarious throughout. Leslie Mann is very good. Michelle Trachtenberg looks pretty and does a passable job. Sterling Knight is nice.on the whole '17 Again' is funny stuff... watch it with your entire family. Thumbs Up!",17 Again
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Zac Efron, a good actor? Who knew?!",7,5 May 2009,"As we've seen many movies like this before: Big, 13 Going on 30, and Freaky Friday, we always love to see the retelling of the old classic story of the switching age. Since the story has been used so much, a director can only do so much to just do the best they can with, Burr Steers pulls 17 Again out with great laughs and good fun. I'm going to get this out, I am one of the rare girls that just doesn't get the whole Zac Efron heart throb thing, I agree that he's cute, but with mainly High School Musical only being his claim to fame other than Hairspray, he is adorable, but can he act? Surprisingly he can. I can't believe I'm saying this, he was actually a good strong lead role and a perfect fit, he has charisma, he's funny, charming and makes this story worth your time and money.In 1989, Michael O'Donnell was a star athlete with a full college scholarship imminent. He seemingly had it all, when, right before the championship game, his girlfriend Scarlett informed him she was pregnant. In that moment, he made the decision to throw everything away and proposed to her. Twenty years later, Mike's life isn't exactly what he expected it to be. Scarlett wants a divorce from him, forcing him to move in with his geeky millionaire best friend Ned, his job is going nowhere, and his kids Maggie and Alex want nothing to do with him. While paying a visit to Hayden High School to reminisce about the life he threw away, he encounters a strange beardy janitor, who I still swear is Bob Haskins. On the way home, is magically transformed back into his 17-year old self. With Ned posing as his father, he re-enrolls in high school, believing he has been given the chance to have his life over again, ""but to do it right"". However, he then discovers that his daughter is dating the basketball captain Stan, who is bullying his son. He realizes that his real mission is to help his children as well as finding out that maybe his decision wasn't the worst he ever made in his life.We go a little Back to the Future-esquire when we get on the creepy level of Michelle Trachtenberg having a crush on Zac Efron who is her father, just that she can't recognize him, it's understanding, but still makes you squirm, but the director and actors pulled the scene off pretty well with getting out of that yucky situation. There is one continuity error: if Mike and his girl got pregnant at the age of 17... 20 years later, yet both their kids are still in high school, the oldest child would only be a maximum of 18. A plot hole: seriously, besides the wife, no one at all recognizes Mike? But I'm over thinking the movie too much at this point, it's just a fun movie with decent performances, I just need to let go of silly mistakes. So I would recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, but I'd say more of a matinée vs. a full price ticket, it has some good laughs and was a great update of the ""What if you could go back?"" story.7/10",17 Again
20,MovieAddict2016,"Reasonably distracting, but nothing new.",6,31 May 2009,"A balding studio executive sits comfortably in the office of a Warner Brothers building, sipping from a Grande Nonfat Caramel Macchiato, listening to the younger man in front of him, who is pulling his hands apart to outline an imaginary rectangular movie screen. ""Two words: Big, Teen Wolf, Freaky Friday, Back to the Future, Vice Versa, It's a Wonderful Life and Like Father Like Son. Okay, that was more than two words. But you get the idea."" - ""Who's the lead?"" - ""I'm thinking Zac Efron."" - ""Who plays the older version?"" - ""Rob Lowe."" There's a brief pause, and then the studio executive leans forward in his chair, creating a temple with his fingers and sighing heavily. ""No. I've got a better idea: Matthew. Frickin'. Perry. Chandler, from Friends. I like him. He makes me laugh. Plus, we owe him that thing."" - ""But he doesn't really look anything like"" - ""Shh, shh, shh. I'm greenlighting this, but damn it, we will have our Matthew Perry. What's your title?"" - ""The Switcheroo. Or maybe Small, since it's the opposite of Big."" - ""First one's too Swedish; second one's too sexual. Call it Seventeen Again and throw in Judd Apatow's wife. I owe him a favour for that thing he did for me that one time at that place with that thing."" That's about as close as I can get to the smugness of Coke Machine Glow without wanting to slit my own wrists, but I thought it had to be pointed out: this movie is really derivative, and you can almost imagine the wheels spinning behind its production, the suits sitting in a room conjuring forth the ultimate product.It's the perfect transition vehicle for a Disney-manufactured tween star: amiable and comfortable enough to play it safe, but provocative enough to place its star in an ideal position to become a Credible Actor. Teen pregnancy? Women falling in love with boys half their age? Incest? Yes, the film touches on all these themes. Its incestuous leanings don't venture far beyond the cutesy factor of Back to the Future, but it's still there, with the daughter attempting to bed the father's younger self.Leslie Mann may just be falling for a younger version of her own husband, but he's still seventeen, and she still refers to herself as a cougar.The teens may all be harmless and unrealistic (the Evil Jock, whom Weeds' Hunter Parrish is given the thankless job of portraying, is curiously non-intimidating), but they're still getting pregnant, and there are still condom jokes.It's sort of interesting to see these topics pop up in a film that otherwise contains all the whimsy and gee-shucks-innocence and naiveté of a Disney movie. I suppose you could argue that the film's predictability in recycling themes from other films is, in fact, unpredictable. I didn't expect them to get recycled in this movie.But I'm rambling, and by now you are probably thinking, Talk about over-analyzing. So here are the things worth knowing about 17 Again: it is reasonably distracting. Efron is likable and charismatic and will make a fine crossover into ""respectable"" Hollywood endeavours (of interesting note: the movie's opening sequence contains a throwaway musical dance number, which seems oddly out of place, as if the producers were trying to get all that High School Musical crap out of the way as early as possible — sort of like how you know every John Travolta movie's gotta have that one throwback dance sequence, and you've just got to grin and endure it).The movie's ending is sloppy, its courtroom sequence as much a cop-out as Big Daddy's was (don't ask me how I made the comparison, but I did), and its conclusion forced and open: what happens to the daughter when she realizes the boy she tried to seduce was her father? What happens when the school principal realizes the man she's dating doesn't really have a son and does some investigating? What happens to the son, whose own sports (and romance) ambitions are left dangling? And, most importantly, what happens to that school bully? Because he really just sort of disappears after beating the hero up and never gets his comeuppance.The movie's more interested in racing across the finish line (and hinging upon all its predecessors' structures) — which doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. It just means its ambitions are misplaced and its possibilities underestimated. It's a good film, and better than I expected it to be. But it's not as good as it could have been.",17 Again

22,KineticSeoul,"Wasn't bad as I thought it would be, and Zac Efron can actually act",7,21 April 2010,"To my surprise this wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, in fact it's actually watchable. The premise of a kid transforming into and adult or other way around has been done before, so there is only so much the creators could have done with this, but it was still sort of fun to watch. Another thing that came to shock was that Zac Efron can actually act, and in some scenes I actually bought into his acting. This is something kids will enjoy and adults won't mind watching with them, maybe I am giving a more positive review of this film than it deserves, but I had such a low expectation of this movie that the good parts about it seemed much more better than it probably really was. It's a back to being young again or visa versa style of genre done decent.7/10",17 Again
23,Robert_duder,"Predictable? Yes. But still manages to stand on its own merit. A solid, funny movie.",8,1 September 2009,"17 Again almost seemed doomed from the very beginning. It was a re-hash of other films along the same lines such as BIG, 13 Going On 30 and Freaky Friday (all great films and borrow from each other) but could 17 Again pull it off? They also had a lead actor trying to appeal outside of his tween audience. It would ultimately boil down to the heart of the film and as luck would have it, the heart wins over. Whether it be the endearing quality of the cast or the fact that the film doesn't try too hard to be serious or force its melodramatic message down your throat, its just fun, easy to watch and for the most part brainless. It certainly won't win any awards except for the stereotypical teen awards which Zac Efron will sweep. The concept is cute and kids, and teenagers will love the comedy and adults can relate to going back to your high school days to make things right. Except Efron's character was and becomes again extremely popular which few of us were...ahem...I was but I'm just saying. Truthfully there isn't anything new here, or anything that will blow your mind but the interaction he has with his kids is classic.Matthew Perry...I love Matthew Perry from his friends' days to his few movies to the under-appreciated and brilliantly written Studio 60. He almost seems a little out of place in this role as adult Mike O'Donnell. Perry's humour is toned down into the straight man for this part and while its a pleasure to see him it is a little hard to believe he is Zac Efron in fifteen years. Speaking of Efron, he plays the teenager O'Donnell and has a lot of heart. He really has a lot of charisma on screen and I think he could really exceed his Disney stereotype. The hard working Leslie Mann is excellent as O'Donnell's wife Scarlett. Her humour from films such as Knocked Up and 40 Year Old Virgin is definitely toned down as well and is far more family friendly but she is still really good. Her and Efron have strange chemistry and yet somehow it works. I think she is very talented as well and she really does stand out in this film. Thomas Lennon is terrific and might be the real comedic highlight in the film as best friend Ned. His quirky character and strange behaviour will keep you laughing and he has great chemistry with Efron as well. Despite popular opinion I thought Sterling Knight and Michelle Trachtenberg did a great job as the O'Donnell children. Although the strange crush Trachtenberg develops on her ""Dad"" which is entirely more creepy than the Back To The Future Mom to son crush but the interaction between Dad and kids is great.This is really a major league move for director Burr Steers who is mostly known for Television and this film is very mainstream and features someone who is bound to be a future star and Leslie Mann who already has a great career even in the supporting role. 17 Again is just simply fun and while it won't blow anyone's mind it will just completely entertain anyone who sees it. The film is family friendly enough for most and everyone can find something fun in it. The physical comedy, and the obvious ""I'm a kid again"" humour never gets old apparently. Definitely worth checking out, it won't disappoint as a fun comedy rental. 8/10",17 Again
24,MLDinTN,nothing memorable,4,14 February 2010,"There wasn't anything new in this movie. It is basically like the film Big. Grown adult male all of a sudden finds himself years younger. In this case, Mike O'Donnell, falls into a water vortex and wakes up 17 again. Back when he was really 17, he gave up his basketball career and college scholarship because his girlfriend got pregnant. He married her had 2 kids and now they are divorcing. At 17 again, he goes back to high school and helps his own kids out while hanging out with his wife. Of course, the predictable happens in which he realizes he shouldn't let his soon to be ex get away and his kids are better than he thought. And he turns back into an adult and everything is a OK.The best part in this is Mike's best friend, Ned. Ned's rich and has all this cool Star Wars props and other things. He tries to make a play for the school principle. That part was funny.As for Zac Efron, who cares. He does nothing memorable in this. He has yet to be in a good movie.FINAL VERDICT: Only for 14 year old girls.",17 Again
25,g-bodyl,It's Nice to Relive 17 All Over Again!,8,23 January 2015,"I thought 17 Again would be one of those teen time swap/romantic comedies that have been done so many times before, with my favorite being 1988's Big. Now there are a rather large amount of clichés and a sense of predictability to make this from being a stand-out feature, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was certainly no High School Musical and the film is smart, endearing, and funny. The film is written well and it pays homage to classic films such as Back to the Future.Burr Steer's film is about a 37 year old man named Mike who is unhappy with his life and is going through a divorce with his childhood sweetheart, Scarlet. One day, he gets a surprise when he wakes up as a 17-year-old with a chance to relive his glory days all over again.The acting was not actually too bad. I had my doubts about Zac Efron, but he actually was able to carry the film without any problems. Leslie Mann did a good job as Scarlet and she had some funny laughs. I really liked the performance as Thomas Lennon, the nerd who never grew up. My favorite scene was the date with the high school principal and Lennon's character speaking to her is elfish language.Overall, 17 Again is a good movie despite being a formulaic comedy. I could predict the film from a mile away, but I believe that as long as we get good acting and good jokes, any predictable comedy can be a good film. I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome of the project and it shows that Efron can actually act instead of being a face for the ladies to goggle at. I rate this film 8/10.",17 Again
26,cricketbat,Surprisingly entertaining,8,16 August 2018,"17 Again is surprisingly entertaining. Yes, it's the same age-switch storyline we have seen a number of times, but there is fresh humor and some original moments in this movie - it's worth watching.",17 Again

Salt in the right recipe can be brilliant. Too much salt, not so much. In this film Perry is ... awful. Seriously, fast-forwarding through his scenes makes for a better movie. And I will not even mention that old Perry looks nothing like Efron because if the casting director managed to sneak this fact by the guys actually writing the checks, who am I interfere with that...? (In fact, only Efron LOOKs like Efron which DUH is why he IS Efron in the first place.) The script (in the non-Perry scenes) is tight, Mann does a credible job, and the key scene where Efron as young-Perry tells off a neo-jock is a classic and worth the ticket.Actually entertaining and fun and sort of gets to you.

28,atlasmb,It Has Its Moments,6,23 May 2020,"In stories where someone plays another character or a younger/older version of himself, it can be really entertaining if the actor can convincingly portray the other character he is supposed to be. A good example of this is ""Face/Off"", starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage.Here, Zac Efron is effectively playing the role of Matthew Perry, which is his older self. Efron does a decent job as an older man, but not enough to capture one's imagination.The story is a common one: a character has another chance to relive the past. ""17 Again"" is fairly predictable except for a few key instances. But those moments are notable and they make the entire film worth seeing. It would be wrong to describe them here, but they are moments of romance and moments of comedy.So, as much as I would recommend other films that deal with its central theme, this film is worth seeing and some of its stronger scenes are in the second half.",17 Again
29,tabuno,An Uneven Comedy Ruined by Over The Top Dumbness,6,20 January 2019,"6 September 2009. Incredibly the script for this comedy actually for the most part had the surprising potential to be one of the best romantic comedies of the year, but it was perhaps ruined by an insecure director or a comedian who was miscast or overplayed his welcome on set. The character Ned Freedman played by Thomas Lennon was just terrible with this prankiness and nerdiness that spoiled the more serious, realistic and heart-felt comic tone of Zac Efron. Even while Ned Freedman's character even had a credible chance at having decent screen time with the school principal, there descent into weirdness led to even more tears in the more important focus on the movie. Only an insecure director or scriptwriter would stoop to having to play the dumb card because of the fear that the main storyline couldn't hold up its end of the bargain or some investor needed the dumb factor to broaden the audience base and supposedly bring into more profits only to lose the integrity of the movie. While the subplots with Zac Efron's character's kids were decent enough, there were editing and character development gaps perhaps left out because of the nauseating need for Ned Freedman to take up more unfortunate screen time. However, the basic scenario was surprisingly powerful and the ended was compelling and meaningfully well done. Zac Efron, however, didn't quite capture an older man in a younger man's body quite as well as Jennifer Garner was able to capture a younger woman (girl) in an older woman's body in ""13 Going on 30"" (2004). Overall, this uneven comedy was better than expected or supposed to be, but it was also had a number of weaknesses that significantly intruded on the entertainment value of this film. 6/10.",17 Again
30,The-Sarkologist,A Fine Highschool Comedy,7,25 April 2021,"I must admit that I find something charming about these films, but then again I suspect that it does have something to do with the desire to return to our youth and get a second chance at life. On the other hand, this film simply has the protagonist become 17 again, but he doesn't go back in time to rectify the mistakes that he made, if he actually made any mistakes, it is just that he regrets one decision, and that is walking out on a basketball game to go with his wife, as opposed to playing the game and being picked up by a scout (if that would have actually happened).The movie is about Mike O'Donnell, who has an opportunity to get picked up for a college basketball team, however his girlfriend tells him that she is pregnant, so he walks out on the game to marry her. Years later he is facing divorce, and he is sacked from his job, and he is simply moping about the decision not to follow through with the game. His best friend however has become a tech billionaire. Anyway, Mike has the opportunity to become 17 again, and he takes it, and returns to school.Here he discovers what is really happening to his kids. His son, who claims to be a great basketball player, is actually the one that the school bully picks on, and his sister is dating the school bully. His best friend, who is still single, falls in love with the school principal, and decides that he will do whatever to grab her attention, and does what one would expect a billionaire to do, and that is throw money around everywhere.I guess there is a couple of things that do attract me to this film, namely having a second shot at life, and also reliving your formative years with the wisdom that comes with age. Okay, I can't say that Mike really has much in the way of wisdom that comes with age, particularly since he is caught up in that 'what if' moment. Then again, many of us seem to be caught up in 'what if' moments, clutching to the past instead of making most of what we have now. Then again, I can't necessarily say that many of us have much of an opportunity to turn our lives around, but then again the what ifs from our younger years may never have eventuated either.Yet in another sense it is also one of those 'wake up and smell the roses' types of films, namely because Mike actually comes to understand that by hanging on to the past, and wishing that things had turned out better, means that he completely ignores what he actually has. In fact, by becoming 17 again, it gives him time to pause and look around. Mind you, one of the interesting things with this film is that it does play on the fact that while he is seventeen, he is also still attracted to his wife, which leads to some rather interesting situations. However, like a lot of these films, everything does eventually work out well, which one can't necessarily say is the same with real life.Still I liked it.",17 Again
31,Rodrigo_Amaro,Efficient comedy but lacking of dramatical substance,6,30 November 2010,"Time travel themed flick meets teen comedy flick with a almost philosophical subject in ""17 Again"". Here Matthew Perry is a loser type who missed many good chances in his life, was fired from his job and he's into a divorce but he has the chance to make things differently when all of sudden he gets transformed into an adolescent in the present time. Zac Efron plays Perry's character on the age 17 and now he's gonna look at life with a new perspective while creating some funny moments. And a Zac film wouldn't be complete without the basketball, again, he's the best player of all time.Director Burr Steers returns with the young growing up theme the same used in the less funny ""Igby Goes Down"", and once again he introduces some reflections about how difficult decisions are when we are young and life passes before our eyes and then we are settled in something we didn't wanted to be part of, things like that. I'm not saying that this a dramatic film but it gets very close, specially when Matthew Perry's character reavaluates his life in the beginning of the movie.Efron responds to the comical side of the film, he does a great job (better than the one presented in ""High School Musical"" films) although he's not hilariously funny as Perry (if we consider what he can do in terms of comedy e.g. ""Friends""). But at least he doesn't sing and he has some clever funny moments (the scene where he convinces his colleagues to support the school policy on sexual abstinence).But the greatest comedian here is Thomas Lennon who plays the nerd friend of the main character whose preferences goes from ""The Lord of the Rings"" and Star Wars"" toys, quotes and assorted things. His attempts to date the principal of the school where Efron studies is one of the funniest things of the movie (dressing with bizarre outfits trying to get her attention or show up in front of the school with a limousine or a bus). Analyzing ""17 Again"" as a comedy the movies goes well, reaches a nice level of good jokes, nothing so rude or gross. Enters into countless clichés about hierarchical high school system, bullyers and all, which is rather annoying to see in a comedy (although all that exists in real life). On the drama level, I think this movie should've be more relevant, more interesting and include more scenes of Perry. The ending was kind of disappointing with a message of something like doing the same things all over again and choose love is always the best choice in life. This movie didn't need much of that sentimental ending. The writer could include more things and change one thing or two. On the same theme but much more interesting ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" achieved a better potential than this film. 6/10",17 Again
32,zkonedog,Surprisingly Good For Such An Overworked Premise,7,10 March 2017,"Considering the fact that the premise of this film (old/young body/soul swapping) has pretty much been done to death in varying decades, ""17 Again"" is surprisingly effective at rendering the concept funny once again in 2009.For a basic plot summary, this film sees an adult Mike O'Donnell (Matthew Perry) dissatisfied with his life and pining for the promise of his high school career once again. Well, thanks to a magical school janitor (one should always watch out for those characters!), he is put back into the body of his former teen self (Zac Efron) for a ""do-over"". The ""catch"", however, is that he is still in the present day (2009), not 1989.The plot of this movie alone lends itself to all sorts of personal and social sight gags, and this movie mines them to their fullest. Seeing Mike trying to weave his way through current high school hallways and scenarios is made entertaining by director Burr Steers. It never gets boring, but also never goes ""over the top"", either.What really makes ""17 Again"" a fun watch, however, is the quality of the acting. Though Perry is okay in his relatively brief role, Efron is solid as ""young Mike"" trying to find his place in today's world. So many viewers can't stand Efron because they view him as a ""pretty boy"", but in this effort he shows he can act a bit, too. Youngsters Sterling Knight & Michelle Trachtenberg shine in their roles as well. Yet, Thomas Lennon (of Reno 911 fame) nearly steals the show as the goofy nerd sidekick, providing some of the funniest moments of the entire experience.Overall, ""17 Again"" is a charming little film that can be enjoyed by tweens on up. A few of the jokes and physical humor is a bit ""risque"", but for the most part it is relatively tame (at least compared to other comedies of the same nature).",17 Again

Although, some parts are kinda odd and disturbing. For example, when Effron was trying to get his friends mom's to like him, that was kinda awkward.

""17 Again"" borrows on that classic age reversal concept as made famous by ""Big,"" ""Freaky Friday,"" and ""13 Going on 30"" only it's aimed at guys. I know, hard to believe that's who would like this movie most, especially with ""High School Musical"" pretty boy Zac Efron in the leading role, but it's true.I don't know much about screenwriter Jason Filardi, but I'm betting the guy was like me in high school -- a dork. Maybe not a Grade A dork, but a dork no less. ""17 Again"" is littered with ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" jokes as embodied in supporting character Ned (""Reno 911!"" star Thomas Lennon), an unmarried black-card carrying nerd who sleeps in a landspeeder bed. I mean, somehow a lightsaber duel gets incorporated into this movie -- a lightsaber duel.You especially know a dork has written a movie when the main character was a talented jock who dated an attractive girl in high school. Mike O'Connell (Matthew Perry) gave up his future in high school to marry his pregnant girlfriend, now his wife with whom he's recently been separated (Leslie Mann). Without his sweetheart, being out of touch with his kids and after failing to land a critical job promotion, Mike starts to regret his life choices until a creepy old janitor at his old high school gives him a chance to do it over again.Now a teenager (Efron), Mike pretends to be his pal Ned's son and Ned uses his wealth to pull strings and enroll him back in high school where he forms a new connection with his two kids, his son Alex (Sterling Knight), the victim of jock pranks and his daughter Maggie (former teen star Michelle Trachtenberg), who's dating the school jock/bully/jerk (Hunter Parrish of ""Weeds."") Eventually he starts seeing a lot of his wife, which makes for some awkward comedy. Mann delivers a great line reminiscent of her husband's (Judd Apatow) comedies as she explains to Efron that this is not some kind of cougar or ""mother i'd like to"" situation.The movie does lean a bit much on the comic device of Mike forgetting he's supposed to be acting like a teenager and not his kids' parent. There are one too many random righteous adult speeches. The gimmick works a few times, such as once instance when he lectures to some stereotypical girls who are saying suggestive things to him about respecting themselves only to give up and say ""this is another father's problem."" Other than that, we're reminded this is a re-treaded comedy concept.What's most likable is that the film understands it's built on convention. It doesn't try to break that formula, but it catches us off guard a few times by not carrying out any overused plot device completely by-the-book, which at least suggests that Filardi, director Burr Steers and producer Adam Shankman who's churned out a good number of successful formula-like films, were trying to go for quality. After seeing this film, ""Hairspray"" and ""Bedtime Stories,"" I'd feel pretty good about going to see or at least renting any other Shankman-influenced film.And I'll even admit I was slightly impressed by Zac Efron.",17 Again

37,Turfseer,'17' never finds its own voice within Alternative Universe sub-genre,4,3 October 2009,"17 Again is the latest entry in what I call the 'alternative universe' sub-genre. Three films come to mind as a point of comparison: 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'Back to the Future' and 'The Family Man'. In all of these films, the protagonist is ill at ease in his ordinary world and must overcome obstacles in an alternative universe to improve his own life as well as family members and the community at large. In this type of film, the protagonist must have a compelling reason for entering the new, 'special' world.Before Zac Efron's 'Mike O'Donnell' becomes '17 Again', the reason he is propelled into an alternative universe (so he can learn a critical life lesson), is hardly compelling. O'Donnell's dissatisfaction with himself is explored superficially. Would some young bimbo who's only been with a company for two months, beat out a top salesman for a job promotion so easily? I hardly think so. The point is that by turning O'Donnell, their protagonist, into a buffoon so early, the film's scenarists prevent us from taking him seriously.Contrast this with a Marty McFly in 'Back to the Future' who courageously battles terrorists as he is propelled into the alternative universe of 1955 where his parents are teenagers; or Jack Campbell of 'The Family Man' who, as a hardened corporate leader, pulls off one of the biggest mergers in US history or a George Bailey, who as President of the Building & Loan in 'It's a Wonderful Life', deftly prevents the evil Potter from taking over the mortgages of homes of numerous people in his community. These other (and better) alternative universe films are better because the stakes are much higher.Both Bailey and Campbell are nuanced characters whose desire for 'upward mobility' lead to an inner crisis. Campbell's metamorphosis is much more benign than George Bailey. His encounter with his 'new family' leads him to gradually embrace new values but in the end realizes he must go back to his old life; Bailey's illusion of becoming a big success is shattered when Uncle Billy loses the deposits and he now faces arrest as an embezzler. The writers of 17 Again have nowhere to go with Mike's 'internal arc'—unlike the characters in 'IAWF' and 'TFM', the adult Mike is too much of a sad sack to have a real inner crisis. Even his failed relationship with his wife packs little punch. Why does she reject him? Because he's basically a wuss who never finishes anything (hardly the kind of stuff that leads to a 'dark moment of the soul'—the main crisis point at the end of Act 2).The writers of '17 Again' are on more solid ground in tackling the story's external arc. The idea is similar to 'Back to the Future'. Marty McFly's inner crisis isn't as important as his duty to transform the lives of his dysfunctional parents. You'll recall that Marty does everything in his power to make his father more confident so that he can ask his mother out to the fateful high school dance where they fall in love. Similarly the young Mike must inculcate confidence in his son by getting him on the basketball team as well as convincing his daughter not to go out with 'Stan', the bad boy 'psycho' she's fallen in 'love' with.'Back to the Future' did have the wonderful 'Biff', the classic villain who was the perfect foil for the ebullient Marty McFly. Stan, unfortunately, remains completely undeveloped in the 17 Again plot. I couldn't understand why he didn't slug the Young Mike right away after he's humiliated by him in the lunchroom. Stan has little to do after that scene except make out with Maggie, O'Donnell's daughter, in Young Mike's presence. Unlike the nuanced face-off between Marty and Biff in BTTF, all Stan can do is constantly slug Mike in the face.There are even more awkward moments including the scene where O'Donnell's daughter tries to seduce her father and the young O'Donnell kisses his wife in front of a crowd of people at a party. The scenes are reminiscent of Marty McFly's encounter with his 'young' mother in the car outside the dance hall. In that scene, they mutually agree that 'it doesn't feel right'. In 17 Again the writers have trouble resolving the incestuous encounters in a satisfactory manner: O'Donnell denies he's gay to his daughter and shrinks away; the wife on the other hand slaps O'Donnell in the face.Occasionally there are some witty moments in 17 Again. Consider the nice bit when Mike is gently slapped in the face in rapid succession by his wife, daughter and her girlfriends—and soon afterward, wacky best friend Ned also affectionately slaps him multiple times after he uses his friend's house to host a party without his permission.There's little rising tension in 17 Again. The 'dark moment' at the end of Act 2 features a nice scene where Mike, in the persona as Ned's son, reads a touching 'letter' to his wife during divorce proceedings and after he leaves she discovers the note merely contained directions to the courtroom. But when Mike rushes back at the climax, he does the same thing he did in the beginning of the film at the basketball game: embrace his wife! What has really changed? Overcoming his 'wussiness' just doesn't cut it. In contrast, think of George Bailey when he blurts out to Bert the Cop, ""Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail"". Now that's a transformation we can really care about!Zac Efron does a fine job as the young Mike O'Donnell. And the subplot, the goofy romance between Ned and Principal Jane Masterston is occasionally amusing. But '17' never finds its own voice within the alternative universe sub-genre. Even worse, the stakes aren't high enough for us to really care about Mike O'Donnell's journey, which unfortunately must be characterized as decidedly 'lightweight'.",17 Again
38,Chris Knipp,"Out of body, out of mind",7,18 May 2009,"Zac Efron has entered the body-change movie genre with '17 Again.' Wouldn't you like to return to high school as Zac? Well, maybe you wouldn't. Maybe even Zac wouldn't. By now he may really be just about done with high school. The 22-year-old 'High School Musical' veteran has expressed an understandable desire to work with serious directors now. He's got to break away from the 'HSM' mold somehow, and this romantic comedy is a start. It isn't much of a start. But this vehicle has the virtue as a new page in Mr. Efron's CV that without him it clearly would be nothing. You watch it for him, and the rest is dross. The thing is, he really is watchable, and for every female in the audience, especially the younger ones, he's catnip. That tan skin; that glittering smile; those sparkling blue eyes; that artfully tousled hair! He's a people-pleaser who can really please.Burr Steers's movie begins with Mike O'Donnell, now a dejected 37-year-old man (played by Matthew Perry) who's being divorced by his high school sweetheart (Leslie Mann). It seems that twenty years ago Mike was a high school senior just about to be picked for a basketball scholarship when he ran off the court to marry his pregnant girlfriend. The basketball scout crossed his name of the list. He never went to college and his life gradually left its zest. He makes good money but feels humiliated at his job. He's lost interest in his marriage and his wife has lost interest in him.But then, somehow or other, through a janitor who becomes his ""spiritual guide,"" Mike is given the opportunity to drop twenty years, to re-enter his supple, handsome, hoop-dream body. Mike's pal Ned (Thomas Lennon) pretends to be his dad and takes him, now transformed into Zac, to enroll in his old high school. It's a chance to go back to that moment on the basketball court and do it differently--a theme that blends elements of 'Back to the Future' and 'It's a Wonderful Life.' Needless to add that the body-change idea has been worked more notably in movies like Big and Freaky Friday. But there's always a new body to change into, and a new gimmick to go with it.This time the gimmick is that that the grownup Mike's two kids are students at the old high school now, and so the now 17-again Mike finds son Alex (Sterling Knight) is being mercilessly hazed and is a basketball talent but needs a push to join the team, while Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) is dating a predatory jock who cannot be trusted. Things turn tricky when both Scarlett (Leslie Mann, Judd Apatow's wife in real life), the adult Mike's disgruntled spouse, who could be his mother (how weird is that?) and Maggie, who's his daughter but looks now like his sister (how weird is that?) both fall for the irresistible Zac--the now transformed Mike. Credit is due to writer Jason Filardi and Steers for keeping this from becoming icky. After all, it is classic stuff from Shakespearean comedy, where disguises make characters fall in love with the wrong person. It's just that incest isn't too funny.The challenge for Zac is ostensibly to communicate the presence of a 37-year-old jaded husband and irate dad inside a 17-year-old. In the event, his behavior just seems pretty odd at times, but he still never stops being Zac. Luckily that works, because despite the blandness of Zac's ""scrubbed young mannishness,"" as Interview aptly put it in a recent cover story, Zac is indeed ""an entertainer in the most traditional sense of the word."" He sings, he dances, he shoots hoops, he ""winks at the girls and nods at the guys."" He works the room (or the screen), and you believe him: his charm is unflagging and reaches out to everybody. Even to you.There are, however, some non-Zac things in this movie that I just did not get. Why is it that the adult Mike, Matthew Perry, is still around, and compares notes with the Zac-ed up Mike from time to time? How does that work, exactly? And what on earth is the point of the annoying subplot of Ned, who meets the principal when he goes in to enroll Zac, falls for her, dates her in series of embarrassing scenes and they turn out to be fellow 'Lord of the Rings' freaks (or something)? Thomas Lennon's fey gaucherie left me completely cold and did not advance the body-transformation story one iota.Another big question is how Burr Steers, who made the very sly and darkly witty youth comedy 'Igby Goes Down,' wind up making something as bland and conventional as this? May both he and Zac do better next time. _",17 Again
39,DarkVulcan29,"Enjoyable, but don't expect it to be a kid friendly movie like High School Musical was.",8,19 April 2009,"It's not all wholesome like the High School Musical 1-3 where, but at the same time it was not raunchy like the American Pie movies where. It is sort of a remake of a 1986 film titled Young Again starring Robert Urich and a then unknown Keanu Reeves.The story evolves around Mike O'Donnell(Matthew Perry) a 37 year old man, who appears to be having the worst year ever. He keeps getting passed over for a promotion at work. His marriage to Scarlett(Leslie Mann) is nearly at an end. His kids 18 year old Maggie(Michelle Trachtenberg) and 15 year old Alex(Sterling Knight) loath his very presences. But one day while visiting his old school, he sees an old picture of him at age 17, on the basketball team. And wonders what if, and a mysterious man(Brian Doyle Murray) asks him the same question, would he do things differently? Mike says yes he would. That night he sees that same about to jump off a bridge, he gets out of his car and tries to stop him. But the man disappears suddenly, Mike looks down in the lake, and it magically start swirling. Mike suddenly falls in. And when he looks in a mirror, he discovers he is 17 again. Mike now(Zac Efron) decides to go back to school, and change his life, and his rich but wacky friend Ned(Thomas Lennon) pretends to be his father.Zac Efron really surprised me, He really was funny, he wasn't afraid to look ridicules in order to get a laugh, I'll bet he watched enough episodes of Friends, in order to get Matthew Perrys comedic mannerisms down. Matthew perry is good, the amount of minutes he is even in it. Leslie Mann was good, so was Sterling Knight. Now Michelle Trachtenberg deserves better then what was giving to her here, I just did not feel she was giving much of a character to play. Thomas Lennon was quite the scene stealer.

40,meeza,It's only Seventeen!!! Seventeen! But the film works for me!,8,5 September 2009,"""17 Again"" is not the story of the mass amount of a certain magazine my kid sister used to stash back in the 80's. And it is not the new title of the script I have been working on which was called ""The Impossible Dream"". OK, these are not really true: I do not have a kid sister and I am not working on a script, sorry for the adolescent fabrications there. ""17 Again"" is the moderately entertaining flick about the youth reversal occurrences of Mike O'Donnell, a middle-aged dude about to be divorced pharmaceutical rep who gets a little taste of the Ponce (""fountain of youth"" discover reference there) when he goes back to being (see movie title). O'Donnell was a popular high school basketball star in his teenage days in the late 80's, but gave up a chance on college b-ball super stardom to continue to be with his high school sweetie. Yes, it is a fictional film! Years pass and the middle-aged Mike is a dissatisfied cranky father of two who has let his marriage slowly fall into oblivion. He is also continuously passed over for promotions at the pharmaceutical company he has been employed at for numerous years, so I guess he is not a proficient drug dealer. Due to the aforementioned, he is displeased with his life and yearns to be (see movie title). All of a sudden through some mystical powers of a pseudo high school janitor, Mike gets his adolescent wish and wolla he is (see movie title). Consequently, Mike is now the classmate of his unassertive son Alex and lovestruck daughter Maggie. Mike also wants to hit that ""hot cougar"" Scarlett, which is really his wife. Let's just say that young Mike's hot scarlett fever returns in his rejuvenation odyssey. The film does get a bit too ""freaky fridayish"" for lack of a better similar themed movie, but it does manage to amuse in numerous scenes. Director Burr Steers does steer the narrative nicely enough even though it did not get a boost from Jason Filardi's formulaic screenplay. Also, Burr could have done without the opening high school b-ball game cheerleading dance sequence, it was not ""High School Musical 4"". Speaking of HSM stars, I was pleasantly surprised with Zac Efron's starring performance as young Mike. And I also have to hand it to the other Mike, that being Matthew Perry playing the adult Mike. These guys acted right to be like Mike. The ever impressive Leslie Mann is again mann or should I say woman enough to hold her ground in a comedy, this time as Mike's wife Scarlett. The youthful supporting cast was adequate but not a fountain of stellar youth acting was discovered here. Thomas Lennon did not get any acting gold medals with his over-the-top work as Mike's zany millionaire best friend Ned Gold; just imagine all the people growing weary of too much Lennon when Burr elevated the character Gold with enormous screen time. But in the end, because of its sheer entertainment value, ""17 Again"" was not a NC (Never Clever)17 movie. **** Good",17 Again
41,MaxBorg89,"No musical, but still high school",6,17 May 2009,"Having made three High School Musicals and Hairspray, it's understandable that Zac Efron wants to move on to different projects, hence his wise decision not to play the lead in the remake of Footloose (which doesn't need a remake anyway, but that's another story). Unfortunately, he still needs to select his material more carefully, as 17 Again comes off as an only partially successful attempt at trying something new.The story goes something like this: Mike O' Donnell (Efron), was a hugely popular and talented basketball player in high school, but had to give up his hopes and dreams after knocking up his girlfriend Scarlett. Eighteen years later, he's living with his best friend, a geek named Ned (Thomas Lennon), since Scarlett (Leslie Mann) asked for a divorce, his kids (Michelle Trachtenberg and Sterling Knight) barely speak to him and ten minutes into the movie he's lost his job. Logically, he wonders what could have happened if things had been different. Magic intervenes and he's 17 again, meaning he can go back to school without making the same mistakes twice. Or can he?By subverting the classic body-swap concept (see Big and 13 Going on 30), director Burr Steers and writer Jason Filardi (the guy who gave us Bringing Down the House) try to blend traditional laughs with a mock-philosophical undertone. Their intentions are undoubtedly good, and the double act given by Efron and Perry is very entertaining (barring that bit at the beginning where the former starts dancing), but there's no denying the story is wafer-thin and hardly ever original. Also, the reversed Back to the Future gag of young Mike being hit on by his own daughter - who doesn't know he's her dad, of course - is overstretched and, frankly, a bit too weird for a PG-13 film (to quote Buffy, incest? Not that sexy).And yet 17 Again is enjoyable in places: Ned's attempts to woo the high school principal (Melora Hardin) are largely hilarious (the outcome is a bit predictable, though), and those who hate Efron with a passion will be happy to know there are two scenes where he's repeatedly beaten/slapped. Still, not quite enough for a film like this.",17 Again
42,davispittman,Just Bad,2,11 March 2015,"This movie was soooo UNfunny in every single scene. This is supposed to be a comedy, let me just tell you it wasn't!! Can't believe this film got 55 out of 100 on Rotten Tomatoes! It deserves a lot lower! Personally, not a huge Zac Efron fan, didn't think he did a very good job in the movie. I didn't laugh once!! I was so bored, and I wanted the movie to end a lot sooner than when it finally did! I just think there are a lot better comedies to watch and actually laugh at out there. This movie was a huge disappointment to me, and I'm sure it also disappointed others that saw it! Overall I'll give 17 again a 2/10, seriously you can do better than this mediocre ""comedy"" movie.",17 Again
43,Enchorde,Easy watching,5,5 August 2010,"Recap: At seventeen Mike O'Donnell literally walked of the basketball court, giving up a promising career and college scholarship, to stay with his high school sweetheart. Nearing middle age, that is one decision he regrets. His life hasn't turned out as he wished, at all. His marriage is all but ended, and he is stuck in a dead end job. How he wishes that he could be seventeen again and start over. And a magical janitor has the skill to grant his wish. But going to the same high school as his own kids might not be as fun as it seemed to beComments: This really is easy watching. It is a simple story, it has been done before, really about that the grass might not be so much greener on the other side of the hedge. But it is done well, once again. A few good jokes has been thrown in and the tempo is quick, but easy to follow. In fact this movie is almost perfect for one of those movies you want to watch a slow afternoon, half asleep or doing something else with half your brain. It will pass the time and actually entertain you a little and you won't have any trouble keeping up.5/10",17 Again
44,Sherazade,You're a baby gazelle and I'm a hungry lioness....grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! LOL! :-D,8,7 October 2009,"Zac Efron won me over with his role in 'Hairspray' (sorry the High School Musical movies were just a little to cheesy for me to watch) and so I looked forward to seeing this and am glad that he did not disappoint. I think we may have found the John Travolta of a new era (let's just hope he can keep it up). I am glad I waited for the DVD because I'm pretty sure I would have laughed the whole in theatres and missed all the good jokes (as is, I had to watch it 3 times to truly appreciate all the comedy).That said, I would like to use this writing space to address the naysayers and whiners: If Zac Efron did not complain to the producers and director of this film about having to shamelessly and extensively flirt with and eventually kiss Leslie Mann while playing a baby gazelle to Michelle Trachtenberg's cougar....um WHY SHOULD YOU? Yeah they're both older than him but so what? Get Over it people, I am sick of reading review after review of people whining about him having to do his job (WHICH, LAST I CHECKED...

45,Kingslaay,Passable,6,21 June 2021,17 again was new and interesting in the first half but the novelty soon ran out. It could have been more and a lot funnier.

46,Matt_Layden,Matthew Perry Doesn't Belong Here.,5,12 May 2010,"A guy's life doesn't turn out the way he wanted it to and wishes he was 17 again. He gets his wish, well, sort of. Instead of going back in time to when he was 17, he turns 17 in the present. Also, Zac Efron will grow up to look like Matthew Perry. How many times have we seen this? Both Big and 13 going on 30 did it, only in reverse. It's exactly like countless other films in which our main character switches back to their younger self with no explanation. Magic? Who knows. Why should you see it then? I don't know, it's got teen heartthrob Zac Efron. Is that good enough? I didn't think so.As soon as the film tells you the conflict, you know the resolution. The question is do we care about how we get there, or about the characters we are about to spend the next hour and a half with. Matthew Perry in my mind was really miscast here, he doesn't feel like he belongs. The material isn't his style, Zac Efron on the other hand fits perfectly. I'm not saying the kid is a bad actor, I actually enjoyed him in this, but he fits this target demographic and style of writing. 17 Again is what you'd expect. Obvious plot details about the father learning more about his kids when he sees them from a different light. He tries to still be their father when he's a kid himself. He falls back in love with his wife, who is currently divorcing him. No one knows about him except his best friend. Who is one of the biggest geeks of all time. Thomas Lennon from Reno 911 and countless character roles in comedy films really has the best parts. How he gets his girl in the end is interesting and funny, even if it's unrealistic.The kids are nothing special and Leslie Mann could have done a bit more with her role, but then again how much material is there for her? How many times have we seen the wife character be written sloppy, sidetracked and never cared about? Countless times, this is one of them. She has more screen time then I expected, but it doesn't amount to anything.The film is enjoyable on a small scale, I didn't hate it by any means. I just found it to be forgettable and that it never tried hard enough to be a standout film. It felt like the director was satisfied in knowing that his main star vehicle would get the film noticed, regardless of the quality. It's too adequate with its place in the world.

Almost 20 years later, Mike's glory days are decidedly behind him.

(Warner Bros.)17 AGAIN could have been another mediocre film that uses the ""body switch"" plot in the most uninspired way. Good thing it didn't. 17 AGAIN uses the formula really well and it is surprisingly funny. The main reason the film succeeds is because of Zac Efron. I know many people out there don't like him and his HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL past but I can't help but find him to be a charming and charismatic person. I liked his performance a lot and he proved to be one of the few talented young actors to come out from nowhere.I also liked Leslie Mann but I felt she could have been used a bit more. Thomas Lennon, however, provides some of the film's biggest laughs. A few weeks ago, I saw him in the film I LOVE YOU, MAN and he's just as hilarious as he was in this that film. I can't believe that I never noticed him before! Sterling Knight also brought some great comedic timing in his role as the son of O'Donnell. Michelle Trachtenberg is really crazy in her role (in a good way) although I thought the film could have used her in the story a bit more. I can't say much about Matthew Perry, though, because he's not in the film that much, unfortunately.There are some parts in the film where it gets a bit silly, but I really didn't care because I was laughing out loud the whole way through.

50,dunmore_ego,Teens and geeks and MILFs. Oh my!,5,1 August 2011,"I've just gone teen-gay for Zac Efron! Before they send the teen-gay patrol to check my temperature with an anal thermometer, I have to add that 17 AGAIN (starring Efron) is a very stupid movie; not deliberately stupid like ACE VENTURA or BALLS OF FURY, but unwatchably stupid, like MONSTER-IN-LAW or GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST. It's a wonder the cast can retain enough conviction to give such good performances. Yet with all the older and (we presume) more seasoned actors on set, how did the best performance come from the tween idol star of the HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL franchise? And why does he have to be so dreamy? 17 AGAIN is the old story of an adult - Mike O'Donnell (smooshy-faced, doughy Matthew Perry, himself a tween idol back when dinosaurs ruled the Earth) - becoming his teenage self (blue-eyed, aquiline-nosed, taut-buttocked Efron) with all his manly world knowledge intact. Mike is an estranged father of two on the edge of a divorce; so the movie's subtext takes us on a stupid journey of self-realization which basically says that the only way you will understand your teenage children is to enroll in their school as your teen self and befriend them. (Which means, parents, that you will NEVER understand your teenage children.) And the only way you will realize your wife is hot after twenty years of marriage is to see her as a cougar while being a hot teen. (Which means, Married People, you're pretty much screwed...)So Mike pretends to be the bastard son of his best friend, Ned (Thomas Lennon, RENO 911), a STAR WARS/fantasy geek, and the only person he trusts with the truth of his plight. Ned's infatuation with the school principal (Melora Hardin, elfin babe) is only matched by MY infatuation with Melora Hardin.So Mike infiltrates his family to set them on a path of goodness and pleasure; I would think the first thing you'd do if you suddenly found yourself a teenager again is visit a medical facility to examine your hormones or DNA or something other than enroll in school to surreptitiously aid your kids, and help your ex-wife with her gardening to win her back. I told you - stupid.Yet amongst the stupidity, Zac Efron is an acting revelation! Though he is 22 playing 17, we never once doubt he is a 40-year-old in a teen's body; his every move is informed with the fact he is a young Matthew Perry. His conviction is seamless, his maturity as a character displaying his maturity as an actor. Yes, there are the nonsensical mystic rationalizations that jog the asinine plot, but once we accept these, Efron's talent screams larger than life and twice as good-looking.The levity is splashed with simple profundity a 17-year-old could never apprehend: Teen Mike on the basketball court, reveling in his vigor, ""We are so fit! Y'know, in ten years you're gonna have a thing around here that no amount of crunches will ever get rid of!"" While his anorexic cougar wife Scarlett (Leslie Mann) finds herself inexplicably sexually attracted to young Mike, yet cautiously keeping her distance, his teen daughter almost rapes him - now that's getting a little weird. Even at this delicate moment, when we could ""fall out"" of the film and simply see it as a teen aggressively seducing another, Efron never loses character and keeps it light rather than sicko.Double standards kick in when Teen Mike frowns on his daughter (Michelle Trachtenberg, HARRIET THE SPY) dating guys, and then encourages his son (Sterling Knight) to hound-dog chicks. What does he think his son is going to do with them - talk about feelings? Aren't those other chicks someone else's daughters? In his actual youth, when Mike was young and dumb, he threw away a basketball scholarship by leaving the court mid-game while a scout watched, to run after Teen Scarlett and prove his devotion. Mike spends the whole movie regretting he could've ""made more of himself"" - which implies he probably shouldn't've done that. Which also implies he would not have married Scarlett.And after all the bitching about his one big regret in life (which, we presume, was that basketball moment - I would've sworn it was doing HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL) - he does it again: runs after Cougar Scarlett and blows another scholarship while a scout watches! And he blows it even further when for no reason he becomes Matthew Perry again! Unwatchably stupid! I like Efron even more when I read his personal quotes at IMDb: ""If I ever have to hear the HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL songs anymore, I would jump off something really tall."" And he's a fan of FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS. Say no more, True Friend.If he can hold this dog of a movie together so cohesively, if this is the level of this boy's talent at this ripe age, we should watch this young star on the rise very closely.And not just because he's so dreamy.",17 Again

53,Sirus_the_Virus,"Better than expected, but not quite good.",6,5 August 2009,"17 again is trying to be a teen comedy. They try to make this film have bad words that don't even exist. Look at this word right here: Twinkle dush(I don't know if that's how you spell it,but that's my guess). That is just pathetic. I never wouldn't have given this movie a chance, but I went and saw it with my grandmother. I wanted to go see Obsessed but she wanted to see 17 again because Zac Efron was in it. She fell asleep. 17 again trys to act like a movie like Superbad but i'm not really convinced. The Plot: Mike O'Donnell, a divorced man with no job, wishes he could be back in High School. So he wakes up one morning after falling through a portal and he's ""17 again"". So he goes back to attend High School and realizes that his kids are doing terribly. His daughter is dating a freak and his son is being bullied by him. So Mike tries to make things better again. I give 17 again a mild recommendation because of a few things. One, Leslie Mann, who is Judd Appatow's wife, is in it. Two, Thomas Lennon, who is on Reno 911, is in it and is hilarious. Number three, some of the film is pretty funny. I didn't mention Zac Efron in there because I thought some parts or lines that he says are silly. He did a fine job, but I don't want to put him as the positives. 17 again has some somewhat gross parts too. Not crap on shoes or barf gross, but disturbing. His daughter(Michelle Trachenburg)falls in love with her own father. She's about to have sex with him. When he tells her no, she accuses him of being gay. I just think it's kind of weird. I am giving 17 again a mild recommendation, though it's not the best of movies.17 again: **1/2 out of ****",17 Again

Until one day he meets the janitor who turns him back into his 17 year old self. Mike enrols into high school and the mayhem ensues.Yes, the plot isn't the most original but it provides some great scenes were you just laugh out loud and certain scenes were you cringe in disgust and laughter at the same time.Zac Efron is underrated mainly because his past acting portfolio, but the guy proves here that he can act a bit and do comedy. Leslie Mann provides a satisfactory performance as the woman that still holds Mike's heart, while the supporting cast are just exceptional in providing the laughs. Matthew Perry was great as well...Overall a good family film that can appeal to any age.",17 Again
55,Joxerlives,OK movie but not brilliant,6,2 January 2013,"17 Again-Apparently this film was conceived as vehicle for Zac Ephron. This put me at a disadvantage going in as I had absolutely no idea who he was. I did however know and love Michelle Tractenberg from her Buffy days and also liked Matthew Perry.So it's basically BIG/13 Going on 30 in reverse, a man (for no obviously identifiable reason) gets to relive the glory days of his youth but finds out that they weren't so glorious and actually he's pretty lucky to have what he has. It's OK but it's none too remarkable. So the good? Michelle is great as always, the gag where she pretends to listen to her headphones so that she doesn't have to talk to her father is great. The scene where she later develops the hots for 'daddy' and stalks him as the 'lustful lioness' is deeply uncomfortable but hilarious (it seems to be something of a recurring theme in her movies as she also ends up kissing her twin brother in Eurotrip). The Star Wars stuff is great, especially the landspeeder bed, someone should make those for real. Great bit where they fight with a variety of fantasy weapons, they should have gone the whole hog and used the 'Glave' etc (although I've never seen lightsabres tough enough to actually fence with, again someone should make those for real). Love the scene where Ephron's character tries to dress 'hip' and some of the party stuff is entertaining. It gets a bit schmaltzy on the courtroom but not too much. The bad? It's all pretty lacklustre and the central theme of making responsible teenagers wait for sex is rather hackneyed especially as the dad's best friend is desperately trying to seduce the principal at the same time whilst Perry's wife and her pal are in the early stages of 'cougaring'. Do we really think that a girl as classy as Margaret would give up university in order to keep together with her loathsome jerk of a boyfriend (although I guess love makes you do the wacky?). It's a bit trite that he has this convenient friend with oodles of money and the ability to forge school records but it's allowable. All told it's not a bad film but no classic",17 Again
56,jaredmobarak,Let's push some pills my peeps  17 Again,4,15 April 2009,"Complete with a cast of notable faces and a stellar soundtrack featuring The Virgins, Santogold, and The Kooks, my initial trepidation was pushed aside as I decided to go into this ""spiritual journey"" mish-mash with an open mind. I'm glad I did, because there are some genuinely funny moments along with a sweet and touching overall message. However, when you look deep into the work you will not find much to grasp onto below the surface. It's been seen before; the relationship between young-again father and his high school children gets beyond creepy; and everything happens just as you'd assume it would. There are no surprises, but did you really think there would be? The film is all about Mike O'Donnell, a soon to be 40 year old who has been looking back on his life with regret. As the star basketball player in high school, he chose love and family above a chance to play in, or even go to, college. The past twenty years have been a chore of responsibility he never could own up to despite his beautiful wife and two children. When divorce proceedings commence and he sees once and for all how little his kids see him as a father figure, he comes in contact with Brian Doyle-Murray's janitor who sends him back, in body not time, to rediscover why he made the choice he did. What is initially looked upon as a chance to be the hero on the court again becomes an opportunity to help his kids against the angst and horrors of high school—becoming a hero in his home life, the path he chose back when he was actually seventeen.It all begins enjoyably as we see this hotshot kid, (Efron's young Mike to Matthew Perry's adult version), do pretty much whatever he wants—he is the most popular boy in school—even being best friends with the biggest dork their age. I've only seen Efron in one other film, Richard Linklater's criminally unreleased Me and Orson Welles, and he was very good in it. What worked in that film is my one criticism of him here, and that is the fact that he looks like he is acting. For a very theatrical role in Welles, it fit perfectly, here, however, in a world that is supposed to be natural, he just doesn't quite have the skills yet. The ability to be good in a few years is there, but right now I believe his charisma carries him. And that isn't a bad thing. I actually really enjoyed the moments when his ""adult self"" came through in his actions and speech after the transformation takes place. The kid is definitely enjoyable to watch.The real success, though, are performances from Thomas Lennon and Leslie Mann. Mann is in her element with this role; very similar to those her husband Judd Apatow usually casts her to play. Something about this woman just works in portraying the attractive mother any guy would be insane to let get away. As for Lennon, well his absolute crazy absurdity steals each scene he is a part of. As the grown-up version of Mike's friend Ned, he is a rich computer programmer that collects and lives in the fantasy/comic worlds he grew up idolizing. When Efron's Mike comes in the house unknown, the two partake in a massive fight scene complete with mace and shield as well as a fun lightsaber dual. But where he really shines is in interactions with high school Principal Masterson, played by ""The Office's"" Melora Hardin. Once we discover her true internal workings and Lennon ceases his ""peacocking"", the two of them cause massive laughter in their creepiness.But that is the ""good"" creepiness. There is a lot of bad to go with it, much to the detriment of the movie. The inherent problem of having a father become the age of his children and try and help them make the basketball team, (Sterling Knight), and practice abstinence, (Michelle Trachtenberg), is that he will become best friend and/or love interest to them respectively. Then there are the pedophilic tendencies of Mann's mother towards Efron, (even though they are technically married), and what is unavoidable becomes used front and center for jokes. Unfortunately those jokes are of the uncomfortable kind, the audience can't get their heads around the fact a seventeen year old is hitting on a forty year old or a daughter trying to make out with her father. That's right  creepy.Couple that awkwardness with the sheer predictability of it all, 17 Again becomes just a run-of-the-mill teen comedy. I did really like the message at its core, that selflessness and the ability to love outweigh any dreams of grandeur for financial or popular success. Sometimes it just takes longer for some—I'm not sure twenty years is a credible length of time, but the writer did need to make the kids of age—or an event to push them back into the reality of how great their life is. I also liked certain scenes like that of Efron verbally abusing bully Stan, (""Weeds's"" Hunter Parrish), in the lunch room, as well as his trying to help the Health teacher get her point across after passing out condoms—there are funny moments. I even enjoyed the filmmakers' knowledge that they were ripping off so many movies that came before. The allusions to It's a Wonderful Life, (the greatest ""spiritual journey"" film in existence), like on the bridge, are great, as is the homage to Back to the Future with Efron's supposed awakening from his dream to be with his daughter much like Marty McFly wakes to his mother. In the end, though, its weaknesses win out. While it is reasonably harmless, there are just too many quality alternatives to recommend.",17 Again
57,jon.h.ochiai,"Okay, I liked ""17 Again""",8,20 April 2009,"""17 Again"" has been done before in ""Big"", ""13 Going On 30"" and one of my favorite movies, ""The Kid"". That being said: I really liked ""17 Again"". This is a star vehicle for teen heart-throb Zac Efron. Okay, the movie opens cheesy with ripped Efron shooting baskets in 1989 as high school star point guard Mike O'Donnell, highly recruited by colleges. Efron also impresses in a dance number with the cheerleaders. It's a good kind of cheese.In director Burr Steers and writer Jason Filardi's ""17 Again"" older Mike (sympathetic Matthew Perry) gets a chance to be 17 again with the assistance of spiritual guide Janitor (Brian Doye-Murray). Efron is really good here displaying charm, humor, and surprising depth and compassion. There is a scene where the young Mike (Efron) consoles his daughter Maggie (vulnerable Michelle Trachtenberg) over her heartbreak, ""When you're young everything seems like it's the end of the world, but it's not"" ""17 Again"" has a certain bitter sweet and affirming resonance. In a light hearted way ""17 Again"" is about the choices we make in life and how we foster greatness for the ones we love. ""17 Again"" works, because of the solid Efron and the amazing Leslie Mann as Mike's estranged wife Scarlett.Mike (Perry) is currently living with his wealthy high school bud Ned (hysterical Thomas Lennon). Ned is the genius, who invented the software that prevents music piracy, and also the guy who made piracy possible. Mike's wife Scarlett (Leslie Mann) has filed for divorce, and he barely knows his two teenage kids Maggie (Trachtenberg) and Alex (Sterling Knight). Mike has a job he hates. After a devastating day at work Mike visits his high school that Maggie and Alex now attend. He expresses his yearning to be 17 again in his glory days to the Janitor (Doyle-Murray). Having ice cream with his kids, he finds out the Maggie got into Georgetown and Alex lies to him about trying out for the basketball team.There is a wonderful scene as Leslie Mann discards Mike's belongings in a wood chipper. Mike confesses, ""I have been so disappointed with my life"" Mann's Scarlett has had to endure this for 18 years of marriage. Mike said he felt obligated. Broken hearted Scarlett concedes, ""Don't do me any favors."" From here ""17 Again"" charts a familiar course as Mike becomes the 17 year-old Efron. What keeps it in engaging is Mike's epiphany that his travel back is really about ""helping Alex and Maggie"". Mike discovers that Alex is a punching boy for bully Stan (jerky Hunter Parrish), who is captain of the basketball team. Stan is also Maggie's boyfriend. Alex is really a great kid with a good 3 point shot, and sweet on head cheerleader Nicole (pretty Josie Lopez). Maggie is the smart and big hearted teen defining herself in the world. Both Knight and Trachtenberg are authentic and very good.The supporting performances are strong. Thomas Lennon as Ned is hilarious and charmingly nerdy. His Jedi Knight duel with young Mike (Efron) is hysterical. Ned also poses as Mike's Dad. Ultimately this works as he pursues the affections of the stunning and funny Melora Hardin as Principal Masterson. I was dying when Lennon and Hardin were talking in Tolkien Elfish at dinner.We stick with the movie, because of Efron and Mann, who are compelling and display a goofy and touching chemistry. Efron is good looking and charming. Mann is smart, sexy, and funny. There is a funny sequence as Mann tells Efron that she is not into the whole ""cougar"" and ""Mothers I like to"" deal. Efron has a moment of solace as his Mike sees the beautiful garden Scarlett designed. The two have a lot of fun with an inappropriate tango of sorts. It's this kind of spirit, fun and touching humanity that make ""17 Again"" so entertaining and worth watching.",17 Again
58,Ruskington,Zac Efron gets a face transplant,4,12 April 2020,"Has there ever been a worse piece of casting than Matthew Perry as the middle-aged version of Zac Efron? I mean, come on; they don't share any physical characteristics whatsoever. They would have been better off just giving Efron the rubber mask treatment and discarding Perry altogether. Leslie Mann looks nothing like her younger self either, it's like they didn't even try with this.Dreadful casting aside, this is a fairly boring movie that treads the same ground as the likes of Back to The Future, Vice Versa and Big without adding anything original. The plot is tired and predictable, and the film takes itself way too seriously.There are some positives though. Efron is surprisingly good in the lead role and shows some genuine acting ability in places. His 'fake letter' moment at the end was actually quite touching and probably the highlight of the film. And while most of the humour in 17 Again is very bland and forced, Thomas Lennon has some pretty good slapstick moments.Standard teen romance gruel- a recycled concept bogged down with excessive sentimentality and tired clichés.",17 Again

60,charlytully,It's a Wonderful Life--for about four months,7,22 April 2009,"True, this is NOT a verbatim remake of IMDb's 30th highest ranked film of all time (Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE), since Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) and Scarlett O'Donnell (mostly Leslie Mann) never sing a duet of ""Buffalo Gal (Won't You Come out Tonight)."" However, the scene on the bridge between Mike's ""transformation magic"" guide, Hayden High School's phantom janitor (Brian Doyle-Murray, spoofing LIFE's Clarence the Guardian Angel, played by Henry Travers) and the hapless pharmaceutical sales rep that adult Mike (Matthew Perry) has morphed into (paralleling LIFE's bitterly hapless savings and loan officer George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart) is a total send-up of the 1946 classic, right down to Mike's plunge into the river. Though I gave LIFE a 10 for its wonderful score, great acting, and iconic happy ending, 17 AGAIN is a MUCH cheerier movie, as the youthened Mike is able to fix nearly everything he's done wrong during the past 20 years (while wising up much earlier in the movie than George Bailey is allowed to). The only tension here is provided by a brief and queasy flirtation between Maggie O'Donnell (Michelle Trachtenberg) and her suddenly terrified ""dad"" (who has retained ALL of his 40-odd years of memories in his born-again state). Mike avoids Maggie's pucker, and he figures out a way to return to his ""old"" self and his ""old"" wife--after about four months of fun and games.QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER THOUGHT:1)Where did Mike's wife, son, and daughter think he (the Matthew Perry ""Mike"") had totally disappeared to for months on end? 2)Did Mike's wife Scarlett realize she could have pulled a Demi Moore, stayed in the stands for that final basketball game, and grown old with the wised-up Zac Efron ""Mike"" instead of the thoroughly de-buffed Matthew Perry ""Mike""?3)If Willie Loman's character from Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN had benefited from some ""transformation magic"" as he was rerouting his automobile exhaust, would he have been helped as much as Mike in 17 AGAIN?",17 Again
61,the-movie-guy,You don't know what you have until you lose it,7,15 April 2009,"(Synopsis) In 1989, Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) is a high school senior and star athlete, who is heading for college on a basketball scholarship. But instead, Mike must give up his dreams, because his girlfriend Scarlett (played by Allison Miller - teenager) is pregnant. Twenty years have gone by and Mike is not living the good life. Mike must move in with his wealthy software genius nerd and best friend, Ned Freedman (Thomas Lennon), because he is separated from his wife Scarlett (played by Leslie Mann – adult). Mike has two teenage children, and he doesn't have a good relationship them either. At work, Mike has been passed over for another promotion again, because he doesn't have a college degree. Mike has hit rock bottom so he returns to his high school to reminisce his glory days. He shares his feelings with the school janitor how great things were when he was 17. On his way back to Ned's house, Mike is changed into a 17 year-old again. Mike returns to high school to finish the life he thought he should have had.(My Comment) The story is a 'what if' story of things that could have been. We don't know how life will treat us when we go down a different path. Where would I be if I had gone to college, joined the army, or not married Scarlet? But what people don't realize is that you only have one life, and you can never go back. You must live the life you have and make it better, if you can. If you want to change the world, make a change to your world, and you change the world. Mike realizes that he hasn't been a good father or husband. He discovers why he fell in love with Scarlet in the first place, and what he has missed by not being closer to his children. Mike already had a perfect life, he just didn't appreciate it. Zac Efron does a good job of making you believe that he is the father of his two children in the scenes he has with them. The storyline is predictable, and we have seen it before, but if you want to see a feel good movie that will keep the whole family entertained throughout, this is a good movie to see. It also has a moral to the story that you don't know what you have until you lose it. (New Line Cinema, Run Time 1:42, Rated PG-13)(7/10)",17 Again

66,Ramascreen,Leslie Mann is a hot cougar!,5,19 April 2009,"--Rama's SCREEN-- I've heard once that Zac Efron wanted to transition from a High School Musical star into a serious actor. If 17 AGAIN is his way of doing that, then it could use some more work. Call me old fashion but 17 AGAIN masquerades itself as a family movie when in fact... it has so many references that are not meant for younger viewers, those Hannah Montana fans which I'm sure are also the target audience of this movie. But I don't want to completely trash this movie because the themes have saved it from becoming a disaster.If you're a Zac Efron hardcore fanatic, you'd say OMG in awe frequently because 17 AGAIN keeps showing moments and shots meant to glorify Efron. By the way, after watching this, I'm pretty sure a part of Efron want to stay as a teen idol, it's obvious that he loves the attention.Actingwise, like I said, it could use some more work. He plays a younger version of Mike O'Donnell who's been given a second chance to relive his high school years and he uses it to win back his family. Zac Efron plays it with a bit of coolness and comic with the dancing and basketball skills, his usual HSM materials.. but when it comes to dramatic parts, it seems as though he's not quite there yet. Maybe because he doesn't have that presence.. when we see him on the screen, we still see Efron, not his character. But I do admire him for trying.. and for hitting on Leslie Mann, the 'cougar' Just wanna throw it out there, I love Leslie Mann,.. I hope her husband Judd Apatow didn't hear me say that and come punch me in the face. Leslie Mann is a darling, she can melt your heart just by looking right back at you. Excellent talent too, I think she's under-appreciated. The tension she has with Matthew Perry is prove that she has a certain level of commanding performance.I think what Efron needs to do is choose challenging roles, Indie gigs that will push his skills to the limit. Plus, it would help to change his stage name.. the name Efron sounds like a B-list porn star.From the trailer, I thought 'man, Thomas Lennon is going to suck real bad' but surprisingly, he's actually funny in this movie as the dorky geek best friend named Ned. LOTR and Star Wars fans would be proud of him.I don't mind the themes and the message that this movie's trying to tell. I just wish it could find better, more compelling ways to execute them but a story about a guy who doesn't realize how lucky he is to have a great wife and two special kids instead of regretting the past is good for the soul.

He wakes up one day and is seventeen again and gets the chance to rewrite his life: it is an already seen story and kinda predictable but still I had the chance to enjoy it. The plot is convincing and very well developed. It is a movie full of comedy and with its very good moments of drama and reflection. The cast is really good. Matthew Perry is excellent as Mike O'Donnell although his role isn't that long, Zac Efron is quite good in his performance of young Mike, with this role he can tell that he has a promising career after HSM ( thank god), Leslie Mann is convincing enough as Perry's wife Michelle Trachtenberg is also good and Thomas Lennon is terrific as Matthew's all time friend Ned, he is so funny that the movie is worthy just to watch him on it.

There's also a great side plot involving Mike's nerd friend, Ned (Thomas Lennon) who helps him get into high school as Mark falling in love with the school principal, Jane (Melora Hardin, who you may know as Jane from TV's The Office). The movie also involves Mark seeing his almost ex-wife (as Mike) Scarlett, and trying to show her that he's changed even know he isn't Mike.

It really just depends on how many of these kinds of storylines a viewer has witnessed to clarify whether they'll be pleased or not.It's usually entertaining.

However, the best thing about the movie is the charisma, likability, and flat out wonderful leading man show from Zac Efron, who is definitely a lot better than I gave him credit for.'17 Again' really isn't anything you haven't seen before, but what sets it above other movies like it is the cast, especially Efron and Lennon. Efron plays a role similar to what he's done in the High School Musical series (actually, I thought I was watching the wrong movie when this one started), but this time it's his ability to channel the mindset of a man 20 years older than he actually is, in addition to being the same charismatic young man that teenage girls fall over for that makes him a big winner in this one. I definitely see the reason why he's so liked.Thomas Lennon leads what is probably the best comedic supporting cast to date, and he had me falling over in my seat from laughter. His antics were over the top, yet perfect, and though they will seem a little out of place at first, it works so well, and makes Lennon more than memorable here. Leslie Mann and Jim Gaffigan are criminally underused, as Mann doesn't stretch any of her comedic muscles here, as she's just playing a textbook wife/mother. Matthew Perry is also underused, but it's Efron's version of the character that really counts, and Perry does his best to channel Efron's mannerisms while blending some of his own (everyone loves the sarcastic side of him).This movie is not without its faults however, the biggest one being the total awkwardness brought on by the events in the movie...subplots involving the main character's daughter and awkward scenes with Efron and Mann ultimately fail on screen (while they sound funny, they just don't play out in the way the film makers hoped), making for some moments that should have you squirming in your seat.'17 Again' is a simple movie that should please its audience. It goes above similar movies because of a great and likable cast, and doesn't fall victim to becoming a kid's movie despite its star. Efron carries the film extremely well (he really has a future ahead of him), and it's a good movie for a teenager (or family of a teenager) to enjoy.",17 Again

Suddenly, transformed back to his 17-year old self, Mike helps out his kids (Sterling Knight and Michelle Trachtenberg) and tries to fix things with his wife, Scarlett (Leslie Mann).I liked the comedy in this film. It was a mix of everything really and there was a subplot with even more comedy involving Ned (Thomas Lennon). I really liked how this movie was similar to the above mentioned movies, yet, still in many ways, different.I always liked movies having to do with time travel, but this one isn't the case. He doesn't go back and get a do-over, he just transforms into his young self in present time. This is my first Zac Efron movie and I have to say he's quite talented because he really makes me laugh but can also find special moments.All the casting was great, I loved all the supporting roles and I loved the plot. I couldn't stop laughing after the big transformation. I think this is a movie for all audiences and I hope everyone gives it a chance.",17 Again
73,mirosuionitsaki2,Hilarious. Short Review.,8,16 May 2009,"Although, it's been a few weeks since I have seen this movie, and I was hoping that the next review on IMDb that I wrote would be about a great movie, such as Angels and Demons, or Star Trek, too bad, I guess. I'll try my best to remember what went down.What would happen if you were in the middle of a divorce, your life was going downhill, and you didn't get promoted to a male reproductive organ enlargement company after working there for about 16 years, and suddenly you're turned back into yourself when you were 15 or so in your senior year.. Going to the same school as your son and daughter, and your daughter loves you? In other words, she has a crush on you.. Well.. This is what happened to Mike O'Donnell, played by Zac Efron when he's a teenager and Matthew Perry when he's an adult.So, not much said, except, this movie was hilarious. It's not what you would expect in High School Musical just because Zac Efron is in this movie. If you want to see Zac Efron cussing, acting like an actual teenager and not what Disney pretends and wishes they were, this is the movie for you. You must watch it, it's hilarious.Recommended.",17 Again

75,MovieGuy109,It's definitely not an Oscar winner,5,3 September 2011,"17 Again-**- Watchable- Directed by: Burr Steers, Written by: Jason Filardi. Starring: Zac Efron, Leslie Mann, Matthew Perry, Thomas Lennon, Sterling Knight, Hunter Parrish, Melora Hardin, Katerina Graham, Michelle Trachtenberg.Burr Steers directs this only marginally enjoyable film about a 37 year old man (Perry) about to be divorced and who knows nothing about his two teenage children until a magical guardian figure gives him the chance to become seventeen again (Efron), which allows him to re-connect with his children and his wife.The question we must ask ourselves is if we care enough about Efron's limited performance, the mediocre script, the clichéd ideas, or the pop references aimed at teen-aged girls to be entertained. It is an idea that wears thin, because a seven year old could have wrote it. The whole thing is a commercial farce made for fans of Efron. Most teenage girls certainly will enjoy Efron, but anyone else will see through his performance intended to flatter its young audience.A lot of people did enjoy this movie, but it depends on our preferences. I feel like filmmaking, like any intelligent art form should question us and be original in presentation. This is neither of those two, but if you do not care about art form and simply want to kill time, one may enjoy it.",17 Again
76,theinaniloquent,"""Who says you can be only young once""",6,17 November 2011,"About a guy whose life didn't quite turn out how he wanted it to and wishes he could go back to high school and change it. He wakes up one day and is seventeen again and gets the chance to rewrite his life.Have you ever been bored? And I mean bored to the point where you'll actually watch a movie with Zach Efron? It may be a little unlikely, but I am one of the few you decided to take this path. Although somewhat of a bad decision, I took pride to it and actually got something out of it. A good movie... So we know what movies of his might turn out to be bad, cheesy, lame, or just overall cringe-worthy. We ALL know that, it's been said before. But 17 Again was surprising because one: the premise was cool. It had a message contained and although not the smartest way of showing it, they executed it nicely. Two: it was from Zach Efron. While some of his movies may be disappointing, I take chances because this film wasn't all that bad. Three: just watch it. Nothing else more to say but watch it. It's not the most recommendable movie I could think of, but rethinking the imaginative story, to the average acting, to the smart premise and execution: I was surprised at how entertained I was. It had it's moments of true cringe-worthiness, but if you take it to the heart (and not to much to the brain) maybe you'll have the same thoughts as mine. 17 Again gets a 6/10.",17 Again
77,pkzeewiz,"Not too bad, but the plots been done to death.",5,2 April 2010,"We've seen this movie so many times with other actors under different names, yet its not a remake LOL...You take the hottest male teenage looking celeb, put him in a role and its gonna sell regardless and the producers know this...I will say though its not too bad, it had its moments.A man realizes that his life has fallen apart and not what he wanted it to turn out like. The gods smile upon him and he suddenly finds himself back in a 17 year old body. Everyone else stays the same, and he blends in with them and finds that his life was worth saving and he then tries to fix all the problems he had as an adult. He has to make his kids love and respect him, he has to make his wife not leave, all of this without letting them know who he really is.OK so this was written by Jason Filard who brought us Bringing Down The House in '03, that movie was funny and way more original, but here it just seems hes ripping off so many things before, from 18 again to 13 going on 30 to Like Father Like Son to Freaky Friday to Vice Versa. In one way or another its been done.The directing is nothing more than you would expect it to be, no one pays any attention to anything in these movies except the actors. Here we have Zac Efron who isn't a horrible actor, but its hard to take a guy serious when he's famous for dancing in kiddie musicals. Here they have to get him shirtless, focus on his sex appeal and yes he dances in it...If you ask me any basketball player who joins in with the cheerleaders for a big dance number before the game probably would get his ass kicked by his team mates. Hey, the producers were smart to use him to sell there product. Matthew Perry made a good older version, and I am a fan of his, but lets face it no one looks that much different in 20 years.The other actors were all okay I especially like the kid Alex played by Sterling Knight. The bully Hunter Parrish was believable as a bully, and I always like bad boys in movies if they are acted well. Also loved seeing my girl Margaret Cho here as a sex ed teacher which is brilliant casting, I love her.I also want to point out I loved the way the ending credits were filmed with the year book pictures.All and all I enjoyed the movie. Its not a chick flick, its not so much a teen comedy and a bit too risqué for a family fun night. It's a nice comedy with some funny parts, some good messages and I was pleased with it.. Don't take it too serious and you might like it. 5 out of 10 stars",17 Again
78,canuckteach,Surprisingly touching...,8,26 April 2009,"This film is surprisingly touching -- and very funny, in places. It is a retread, of course: sort of 'Back to the Future' meets 'Uncle Buck' meets ""The Best of Times"".At the outset, I'd like to point out that other efforts in this genre seem to degenerate into sappy sentimentality or become mean-spirited some time around the climax (this tired device is supposed to enhance the 'lift' at the end). 17 Again avoids that. An example is the conflict between Zac Efron's character Mike and a jock/bully named Stan, a team-mate on the basketball team. It doesn't erupt into the expected street fight - each guy gets his 'shots' in, Mike triumphing in a brilliantly written scene in a cafeteria. Stan is no 'Biff'.No question that the likability of Efron has a lot to do with the appeal of this film. He has to compete with Thomas Lennon, who seems to be a skilled scene-stealer. Come to think of it, these two could handle a remake of 'Back to the Future' in their sleep, Efron playing Marty McFly, and Lennon replacing another pro scene-stealer (Crispin Glover) as father, George.Watch for refreshing support for traditional family values (even though a mishap by 2 teen lovers sets the stage for the story). Mike laments 'You girls are some other dads' problems'. And Mike Senior (Matthew Perry) begins to realize that he might just have his dreams after all, a jewel of a family who just need Dad to get on board.Finally, kudos to the Production team! Nifty editing, short scenes that move the story along, and a finale that fades to black at the right time. And I must confess: when the inevitable replay of a basketball game occurred, I had no idea what was going to happen.8/10 - generous, but we like PG Comedies that Hollywood hasn't ruined",17 Again

Surprise, this is a very funny, very charming and a really warm hearted film. The actors make it work. I had no problem believing Zac Efron as a younger Matthew Perry. Both guys really pulled it off brilliantly. The rest of the cast was perfection also, especially Tom Lennon as Perry's very wealthy, nerdy buddy and the O'Donnell family, wife Scarlet (Leslie Mann), son Alex (Sterling Knight), daughter Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg). The story is well paced and very engaging with a terrific script. Even though this scenario has been done before in ""Freaky Friday"", ""13 Going on 30"" and others but the premise works very well because of fine directing by Burr Steers and an excellent cast of actors.

I'll start with this, why does no one recognize the 17 yr old version of Mike, not his daughter or son, best friend from HS or ex coach? Zac is a good looking guy with a memorable face, seriously, hasn't everyone seen pictures of their parents when they were teens? Wouldn't you recognize them? And his wife of 20 years does not hear a difference in his voice on the phone even though we all do? Then he introduces himself to his own son as the son of his uncle, this must not be a very close family.In what world does a bigger guy and captain of the basketball team stand around to listen to a soliloquy tearing him down. In my high school big guy would have pummeled little Zack into a pulp.Why is older Mike 6 inches taller than younger Mike? In the movie's beginning he's about 7 inches taller then his wife to-be in high school but as an adult she is the same height as 17 yr old Mike, wow! I guess we're supposed to believe that after age 17 not only did Mike grow 6 inches but his petite girlfriend grew 7, that's some growth spurt so late in life, do they live next door to a nuclear power plant? Mike keeps on stopping by their house but the irresponsible Mother never calls the uncle to see where he lives or how he suddenly found his 17 yr old long lost son? Young Mike has an issue with his wife going out on a date but doesn't find it creepy that she is flirting with (even though it's really him) her 17 yr old nephew. And seriously, all the guys out there, if you suddenly found yourself looking like you did at 17 with the mind of a 37 yr old wouldn't one of the first things you'd do include going after young women???? But he completely ignores them. Also why is he in the same class as his daughter who would be two years older than him if he had her at 18 and he is 37 when he changes.How does the mother know where the party is, and she comes to get her son to what, embarrass him? Then the principal and her husbands best friend show up, but then who is the uncle we've never seen because that's not him but then, but.....man am I confused.Bottom line - Why do all modern high school age flicks all require you to suspend all disbelief in reality?

They should have given half the movie to Matthew and the rest to that annoying pretty boy Zac Efron. But Mathhew is only in the movie for a very short time. And though he is a little funny, he is completely wasted in this teenage-crap. They must have offered him a lot of money to do this. This should have been a Matthew Perry movie with Zac Efron, not the other way around.This movie pretends to be a comedy and iut could have been funny with a descent script, but it's really a morality tale. One scene made me puke and just find the last scenes with Perry. It is of course the scene in the class room where Zac talks about waiting to have sex until you're in love and married and that you should only make love as he calls it to make babies. I wanted to kill him and the writers right there. Shut the hell up!! It was as painful to watch as that scene in 90210 where Brandon Walsh stops a stripper from taking her clothes off because he feels like he's gotten to know her. Aaaaaargh. And all that crap about Zac going to the same high school as his kids and trying to protect them is just boring.It should have been about Zac not fitting in anymore as a teenager and appreciate his life as an adult. They could have made funny scenes where he was a geek all of a sudden. But that would'nt have suited Zacs pretty boy image.Whatever, this movie sucks and I hate morality tales pretending to be comedies.Disney should not be allowed to make these kind of movies ever again.This is 2010 Disney, not 1950.Even Americans must hate these type of movies, except overprotective extremely old fashioned religious parents.

Since I knew what the film basically was going to turn out to be, I was just looking to see if the makers, actors and actresses did it right.When it immediately started off with Zac Efron shirtless, I knew it was going to be a good movie, haha, joking, but seriously, in the end, I was very pleased with how this turned out. Though cheesy at times, this movie really delivers! I mean, it was clichéd and yet I enjoyed every second! Who says predictable films can't be fun? The movie was excellently done and excellently played out. It even managed to get quite a lot of laughs out of me, and it never stopped entertaining, by that I mean I never lost interest. Yes, this film of course isn't a masterpiece, but I really thought it was very well done and overall lots of fun!Zac Efron gives a great performance as a teen Mike O Donell and the supporting actors and actresses are all likable and believable in their parts as well, which I found to be even more enjoyment, considering that a lot of films today have teens that couldn't act their way out of a bag. I laughed, I didn't cry, but was really touched at times and then at the end, I nodded my head in approval for 17 Again was a really nice and satisfying teen flick that deserves it's over average rating and any positivity it gets.My favorite things were Ned's geekiness and Zac Efron's quirky humor with his daughter and son throughout the film.

Though, unfortunately, too much is borrowed from the legendary Back To The Future series to praise the film for its script & moments unusual feeling brought upon by time travel.

In the process he learns some things about himself and his rocky marriage which are also valuable lessons.What surprised me most though was that this movie wasn't some excuse to show the main character taking advantage of his age to do things most 17-year-olds really shouldn't... there was no excuse for 'coming of age' or teenage lust or anything like that. In fact (I'll skip the details so as to not spoil things) when he has the chance to do something like that he very wisely uses it as an opportunity to push a more intelligent course on the other person involved.It's not a fantastic movie but it is interesting enough that I watched it through - many movies lose me partway.

99,andell,Silly...but very cute!,8,21 April 2009,"Going into this movie, I knew that it was going to be a silly premise. Sub-40ish man in the cliché marital difficulty and not relating well to his children, falling into a time warp and discovering that he has gone back 20 years is very silly, and to some degree, writes itself.However for all intents and purposes, it is really hard not to come out of this movie with a smile on your face...even if you're a 30-something man.Zac Efron stars as Mike, a high school basketball stud who is being checked out by a scout, is happily in love, and even stands up for the little guy. Nevermind that his little friend Ned looks more like he should be in elementary school...I think we all know that nice, popular guy in school that everyone loves.Well Mike is in for a shock as his girlfriend Scarlett tells him she's pregnant, and in a flash, his hopes for a basketball scholarship goes out the window.Fast forward 20 years, and Mike (now played by Matthew Perry) is a newly separated man living with his childhood friend Ned, who has cashed in on the cliché that small nerds make wealthy adults. Of course Ned is ever the nerd: his home is more like a shrine to George Lucas and JRR Tolkien, but that's besides the point.Mike, forced increasingly to face the loss of his family, and finding his career and friends wanting, longs for the days when he was a star high school basketball player. It always helps when an old janitor who, in different attire could pass for Santa Claus, is there to overhear and grant the wish to be 17 again in a rainstorm on a bridge.Falling off the bridge, something that would kill most people I suppose, Perry becomes Efron once again, and Ned fills in to provide more comic relief as the father of ""Mark,"" Mike in disguise, looking to reconnect with his teen kids while he himself is a teen.It is at this point that Efron really shines. After the initial hiccup of using K-Fed as an example of hip fashion, he settles in as a handsome, athletic teen who learns that ""his children"" have missed out on the benefits of a positive male role model, and are struggling with their place in the high school hierarchy.Whether it's taking ""his son"" Alex under his wing and helping him both join the basketball team and land his first girlfriend (which isn't so much a peculiar site...after all, best friends are often there like that for one another), or trying to help his daughter Maggie see the anchor that is her boyfriend, or recover after he breaks up with her (which leads to one of the most awkward, and also one of the funniest moments of the movie) are both touching and hilarious! Indeed, when it comes time for Mark/Mike to return to the present, we are almost sad to see the teenage Mike disappear once and for all! Of course, the movie is not without major flaws...however if you look past those, this movie is full of touching moments, and full of funny moments as well.Certainly more than enough to make it worth a watch! :-)",17 Again

Right before the game that could make him into a star, Scarlet tells Mike she's pregnant, Mike makes a drastic and life altering decision and runs out of the game to be with her giving up his chances of becoming a basket ball star, now 20 years later Mike's regretting it all and wishes he could do it all over again, and by some miraculous way he does.17 again is a cool and stylish what if movie, it brings to light the question of what if you could change your life, if you could live it all over again.What would you do different? That's the question this movie propose and tells with a grand lush style that resonates with the teen population and even with the adults too, 17 again is not just some teen movie, it's a movie that even adults between the ages of 30-50 would enjoy it, my dad sure did.

Alas, I'm more the age of Matthew Perry, so I better just stick to appreciating my husband. My point is that Zac Efron has an incredible screen presence. This is a great movie with a great script, soundtrack, and cast, but it's the star that makes this film superior.This is a teen film that's not just for teens. Efron holds his own especially in the scenes with Leslie Mann. They have wonderful chemistry that isn't creepy due to the unusual storyline. My favorite scene is when they are dancing together. He takes the lead and says, ""Jump!"" Mann is refreshing as the newly single mom who is beautiful and has chemistry with both of her male costars Perry and Efron. Thomas Lennon also really makes this film from the ""peacocking"" to speaking in elvish. He is so over the top hilarious and it works. Melora Hardin is excellent as his love interest. All the teens, the basketball coach, the spirit guide. You name it! They are all excellent!!You really have to see this movie to appreciate it. It does have some mild language. Otherwise, it's a great family film or a film for anyone who appreciates great comedy. It's one of my favorites and is a great pick me up movie when I need a laugh.

It's a decent enough film, for teenage girls. Other than that it's nothing. It's not especially funny, the idea's nothing new. It will be forgotten, I think quite rightly. Zac Efron's performance is perfectly fine, but most boys will find him annoying. The real gem of this film is Matthew Perry, who isn't in it enough. It has a perfectly interesting story, but it's hardly original and at times slightly frustrating. Efron's character is at best flat and at worst very frustrating. But like I said, it's easily forgettable. But that doesn't make it awful.",17 Again
103,andro-dolic,Zac Efron can be only attracting for some crazy girls,3,8 May 2010,I don't know why did I accept to watch this movie . There are so many stupid reasons but OK . I hoped that it will be some first-class romantic comedy but when I realize that I hate romantic comedies then every hope is needless . While I was watching this teenage comedy I didn't enjoy so much . I can say that only this clumsy friend laughed me . Zac Efron was terrible . Looks like he can be only in some teenage comedies for crazy girls . I didn't mean mentally crazy . I meant that they don't know to appreciate some truly comedies like Dumb and Dumber or something else . During this movie there are also few stupid dramatic moments but also funny complications which finished on terrible way . This all fantasies are not entertaining . Also ending when 17 boy is disappearing is too bad . There are also appearing some terrible mistakes but looks like this is only for bored teenagers . I don't want to say anything bad but I have to . This movie has got some director's great imagination but looks like Zac Efron wasn't the best choice . This movie is on one hand entertaining but it is too bad for some funny comedy . Too many bad romance screwed potential of movie . I am not so impressed with it .,17 Again
104,TheArgentWolf,"An old idea, but still a good idea",10,14 May 2009,"This kind of storyline has been done a million times over. An older character wants to right the wrongs of his past, and gets made younger to do that. The good thing about this is that at some point, the movie actually makes fun of this being an old concept, which shows that it knows how to laugh at itself. But Mike becoming younger enables him to connect with his son and daughter on a much deeper level than he would as a father, and even manages to find out what went wrong with his wife. I personally was more touched with the friendship he developed with his son than most of the rest of the movie, though there is a hilarious scene between him and his daughter, which shows both Efron and Trachtenburg at their comedic strengths. I was most impressed by Sterling Knight's performance. After seeing him in Sonny With A Chance, I doubted he could play a character who was supposed to be unpopular and a geek, but his ability just showed me what a multi-talented performer he really is.",17 Again
105,MovieSonic,Surprisingly good but not brilliant,7,19 December 2010,"Firstly; the film is good and is well worth watching.A couple of points:Matthew Perry was very badly miscast in this film. His role in this type of film should really be played by a 'pretty face' whom we won't be disappointed at seeing instead of Zac at certain crucial times in the film.That is not a bad reflection on Perry as this is the fault of whoever cast him and to Perry's credit, I honestly don't think that another actor more 'aesthetically suited' to the role would have delivered his lines with anywhere near the same biting humour that Perry does.In my opinion, Matthew Perry should choose his roles more carefully. I feel he would suit more 'quirky' characters that are far removed from ""Chandler"". Or he could wait until he gets old and his face becomes completely unrecognisable as ""Chandler"" so that stereotyping is no longer an issue..?With regards to Zac Efron; he was the biggest surprise of all.Being in my twenties, I haven't seen any of his previous work although I had heard of him (honestly don't remember how then?!) With an overly done plot and often clichéd script, he manages to deliver his lines as though this is the first time anyone has said such cheesy things!Not to say that there isn't any originality to be found it's just that the corny bits are so corny that they really stand out! I truly do not think another actor from his generation would have been able to pull off this role and he performed with more enthusiasm and depth than I imagine was needed for the film (let's face it, the film would have been huge if he had just smiled into the camera all the way through!) and that is what all the best actors do - they give it 100% even when not required because whatever you think of the film, there could be someone important watching..I hope he doesn't do a J-Lo and sacrifice good roles for lead roles and takes some smaller interesting parts (much like Brad Pitt) to show his talents as it may mean losing a few big payoffs now but will possibly lead to a much longer (and more satisfying) career in the long run.For purely 'enjoyment' factor the film deserves an eight but I have to give it seven because there were a few too many clichéd moments, Efron was carrying most, if not all, of the film and there were a couple of bad casting decisions made that spoiled parts of the film.",17 Again

108,markymark70,Better than I thought it would be....,7,14 April 2009,"I saw this movie with the whole family in our local cinema after days/weeks of 'can we go see 17 again' questions from my 6 year old daughter. She is incidentally a devout follower of the High School Musical franchise of which Efron reigns like a king. So we all go in to see the movie - my wife, daughter and two sons. It starts off with Efron playing basketball with no shirt - tick one for the teenage girls. Then he dances on court with the cheerleaders - tick two for the teenage girls. The slick Hollywood machine is grinding into gear with alarming speed here. My mind is starting to think - 'Uh oh - this could be a huge turkey coming up' - but then something happens which was quite a surprise. The film was actually standing on its own two feet and starting to be quite a good watch.Okay - the plot has been done a hundred times, and the slick machine still oiled its way through the gears desperately throwing in Efron, songs, basketball - for the teenage girls; yet also trying to rope in an older audience of 30-somethings by referencing the 1980's. Guns N' Roses and big hairstyles hitting the memory button for those older members of the audience.Let's not get too carried away here - this is not Oscar material but it is fun. Efron gives a good account of himself - even if he does succumb to the machine in turning out as yet another fleet-footed, singing and dancing basketball player (who'd have thought there were so many roles out there with these requirements). The film itself reminded me of a mish-mash of a number of earlier Michael J Fox movies - Back to the Future melted in with Teen Wolf - with Efron in the Fox role. Efron doesn't have the charisma of Fox but he gives it a fair old try here. Some scenes he is guilty of over-acting and just plain 'acting' but in other scenes he does quite well. The scene where he gushes out his love and affection for his wife whilst in court - supposedly reading from a letter - is one where he nails the empathy required. His tears and red eyes and demeanour manage to create a genuine heart-breaking moment. Thomas Lennon as Efron's best friend/Dad does a great job with his material. Very funny and steals a lot of scenes.Overall - the mechanics are obvious here, the story glaringly rehashed and dated - but the overall package works quite well. Where Efron goes from here is anyone's guess. He has the looks/ability to make it - he seems to have the temperament too but he just needs to keep his feet on the ground and pick his next 5 movies very carefully. If he makes the right choices he will be the next DiCaprio - if he doesn't he could be the next C. Thomas Howell !!!!7/10.",17 Again
109,fatcat-73450,Good Successor to the 80's Parent/Child Switch Subgenre,7,15 October 2021,"The 80's was littered with these sorts of supernatural movies about parents switching bodies with their children and having to go through their teenage years all over again. In fact, this movie's title is very close to 18 Again! (1988).In this case, the father just turns into himself as a teenager and he has to help out his teenage son and daughter. Well, he doesn't ""have"" to do it - the stakes are low as they're just going through typical teenage travails (bullying, bad relationships, etc.).You get a lot of the same tropes as you do for the 80s movies. There's the big sport event, the geeky friend, over-the-top mean boyfriend, the timid guy getting the girl, etc.The adult version of the protagonist also fixes some of his personal problems after his transformation.This movie's plot is mundane and shallow and it has nothing novel or interesting to say about its subject matter, but it shines through its humour. It's very funny, so it's really a top-notch family comedy. Just not sure how well the jokes are going to age - it's very topical.Honourable Mentions: Back to School (1986). Might just be the finest of this class of movies. Also perhaps the odd one out since it doesn't have any supernatural elements (Dangerfield plays a rich guy who just decides to go to college with his son and helps him in that capacity - no magical transformation needed).",17 Again
110,treadwaywrites,It Didn't Make Me Throw Up,6,17 April 2009,"I don't think it should be any surprise that this movie is merely a quick vehicle to get Zac Ephron in a movie and making money as fast as possible before, god forbid, he becomes a flash in the pan. If you have seen a trailer for the film then you've pretty darn near seen the film aside from the juicy bits that all the tween girls in America are frothing to see.Basically this is about a guy named Mike O'Donnell (Mathew Perry) who is having a rough time in his life. His wife is wanting a divorce, his kids are remote at best, he didn't get the big office promotion and let's just say his life has been going down the drain since his life at 17 when he was the big basketball star. And, let's cue the body swap movie.In order to get us, the audience, where we need to be which is watching Zac play out this 17 again life while maintaining his middle aged knowledge, Mike (Perry) falls into a Twilight Zone type of vortex where the switch happens. Switch? Instead of being 17 again he should have asked to go back in time 20 years. Think of movies like Big (in reverse) or Freaky Friday, only in a good way. Perhaps Like Father, Like Son comes to mind. Maybe even a dash of It's A Wonderful Life is even thrown in. Whatever movies you think of, and there are plenty to think of here, writer Jason FIlardi is responsible for the premise being rammed down our throat. I use the word writer loosely as do I also the word responsible. Filardi has brought us Drum and Bringing Down The House. As for responsible, well that should go to the executives that were determined on creating a Zac Efron project rather than looking for a project for Zac Efron. The real question was why I was even attending a screening of this movie. Well, I have a just turned teen daughter who had to see this trifle so when the passes came up I had to take them. In attendance was also another 100 teenage girls sans boyfriends. Just as contrived as the movie itself is shirtless Zac, who when he took off his T-shirt, my hearing failed from the squeals that only teenage girls can make. And why does he have to play basketball again!!I can tell you that this is harmless entertainment. We've seen actors stoop much lower than this though I can't tell you how we ended up with Matthew Perry cast as adult Efrom. I also can't tell you why we need to have Brian Doyle Murray as the janitor that just happens to have the magical ability to make vortexes appear at his whim. Seems like he could do better than the janitor gig. Overall, I didn't throw up. I actually found a couple of the scenes funny and fresh. There was a lot that I didn't like that with a little work could have been made much better, but Hollywood is lazy that way and if they don't have to do the work, they won't.",17 Again

112,greenylennon,Zac Efron's celebration,5,17 May 2009,"I had gone to see 17 Again with the strong desire to hate it. Instead I saw an average comedy, good to keep you entertained in a boring weekday evening: simple, with some funny moments, but easily forgettable because it is similar to many other movies. The main point of interest here was Zac Efron in the leading role, trying to get out from High School Musical. He wasn't very bad as an actor, neither was particularly good, but I think that in this kind of movies you aren't given the opportunity to shine: so everyone did his job fair to middling, except for Michelle Trachtenberg, that I felt very fake and without personality. I think what you best remember after a week you've seen it it's the way Zac Efron's appeal is celebrated: all shots have the purpose to underline his blue eyes or his body, for the teenage girls' delight.I really don't know what to add to this comment, because the movie was so evanescent that I'm beginning to forget the details. Oh, that's what I absolutely wanted to say. During the scene in the health class, Efron performs an irritating, hoary sermon about sexual abstinence (and then he kisses Leslie Mann!) that I found utterly hypocritical. I wonder why now every film has to feature these lectures! I mean, all things considered, it's only a comedy.",17 Again
113,Kalle_it,Not new but at enjoyable for what it's worth,5,8 May 2010,"Let's cut the chase: 17 Again is NOT an innovative movie, but it's adequate for what it is: an harmless pop-corn comedy for a rainy Sunday afternoon.And considering the average level of Hollywood productions, that's not too shabby.Mike, 40 and disappointed by how his life has turned out, magically gets his teenage body again, so he can get his long-desired ""second chance"".Of course he'll end up in his old Highschool, the same where his kids are now, so he can also take better care of them while trying to recapture his spot as hot shot of the basketball team.Along the way Mike (now called Mark) bonds with his son and his daughter and also finds out he's still madly in love with his wife Scarlett.Misunderstanding and plenty of awkward situations, included a dangerous moment in his daughter's bedroom, lead to the grand finale, which I won't spoil, but if you've seen two movies in your life you can easily guess how it ends...In truth the plot suffers from all the typical flaws of the ""swap/back in time"" movies. The biggest one is the ""Marty McFly paradox"": basically a younger clone of a character shows up (while said character disappears) yet nobody seem to notice or to suspect there's something fishy. Just Mike's wife is slightly puzzled at first but then she goes with the flow too. Doesn't the daughter notice the guy she's trying to kiss (rape?) looks exactly like her father at the same age?Then a lot of other, smaller, details are conveniently glossed over or simplified.Without doubt the brightest part of the movie is the Ned-Principal Masterson affair.Ned is Mike's geeky friend who became rich thanks to a piece of software he invented, and pretty much kept on living like a dorky teenager, with all his expensive video games and comic book memorabilia.Then he falls for Mike's principal and comes on to her in the most bizarre, tacky and campy ways you could ever imagine. More or less a case of ""how loaded nerds would try to impress girls out of their league""Definitely the best part of the movie in terms of entertainment and novelty.All in all 17 Again is one of those movies you can mindlessly enjoy. It won't change you, but it's a pleasant enough diversion to spend an evening without thinking too much.5/10 is good for a movie that could have easily gone much lower",17 Again

The light saber scene is FANTASTIC.I do love physical humor though. Zac did a great job being young with old attitudes etc. and I don't know why everyone dogs on him so big time. All actors have to start somewhere...sheesh. He is talented big time. Sing, dance and act. He was very believable in this. But, the Ned guy is fantastic.

115,HandsomeBen,not good,3,2 January 2021,"Takes itself way too seriously. Around 40 min mark I gave up because it was very boring. It should have been funnier but there are barely any jokes. Instead this is painted as a body switch comedy, when really it's a dramedy about a father trying to connect with his kids while going to school with them, while looking like a younger version of himself. When it actually had jokes they were good, but it's far and few. Rob Lowe would have been a better fit to play an older Zac Efron.Leslie Mann was the the most boring part. Zac efron did a good job at playing an adult man in a teen body, the interactions with his daughter were the best parts, especially when the daughter started to have a crush on her own father unbeknownst to her. Zac being fatherly reminded me of the dynamic with Queen Latifah in Bringing Down the House. Although I did find it unrealistic that he didn't want to at least hook up with a few of the high schoolers, before getting back with his wife. Speaking of the wife I couldn't stand Lelie's mann's character. She ruined his life twice cause she didn't know how to use birth control, and it's painted as romantic. Trash",17 Again
116,moviesaccordingtodes,17 Again made me fall in love with Zac Efron,7,21 October 2010,"I have to say that I didn't want to see this film just because of Zac Efron. I was not a fan. I didn't like his pretty hair, his preppy face, and I was against his Disney activities and his choice to date Disney channel girls. I am embarrassed to say that I am now in love with Zac Efron. He was a much better actor than I thought he would be. He was funny, adorable, and charming. This role of his completely won me over. Just like the amusing Zac Efron, 17 Again was adorable, funny, and charming. It was definitely a feel good film but it had a touch of sadness that was all too realistic. Though the movie is meant to be funny it had a strong underlying message throughout the film. It was about our hopes and dreams that are ruined by the unfortunate surprises of life and realizing that your dreams aren't always as great as the reality you are already living. The grass is always greener on the other side, 17 Again gives us a beautiful example of this. Sometimes those unfortunate surprises are blessings in disguise.Overall the acting was decent but I was quite surprised that Zac Efron's acting left Matthew Perry in the dust. There is a particular scene when Efron turns into Perry. The acting comparison was just sad. Efron was so natural and convincing while Perry obviously struggled to transform into his character.I think this is the beginning of Zac Efron's successful career and sadly the end of Matthew Perry's not so successful career.I was skeptical about seeing 17 Again. A movie about going back and reliving your lifeit has been done many, many times before. Don't let that discourage you though. 17 Again is well equip to handle the competition. I was impressed. I liked this movie a lot. It was just the type of feel good film I had been wanting to see for a while. Oddly enough it encourages you to reflect and reevaluate your own life.",17 Again

Amazing!! Simply Amazing! I would recommend it to others from 13 to as old as the hills. Zac whathisname is as good as Michael Fox ever was, and that is meant as a high compliment...

I don't consider anything happening in it to be funny, since it's presents a number of uncomfortable situations of conflict and annoyances like a fog horn repeatedly blaring off like some worn out broken record. Only interesting thing to watch was the small part of the cheerleaders. I don't think Zac Efron was a good match for the younger character of Matthew Perry. If this movie was to help a man to become enlighten once again to see true value in the blessing of having a woman in his life, instead of taking everything for granted, then this fails to do such.

From the looks of the trailer, it seemed that the main character (Zac Efron) would just experience being a teen again. However, the story is more than that. The main character turning back to a teenager is just something that drives the story. The movie shows his experience helping out his family without letting them know that it's him in teenage form, while at the same time teaching some moral lessons that every teen should follow. The movie is funny and very entertaining, and the acting is pretty good. Zac Efron is becoming a better actor, and the supporting cast are pretty decent. The movie would be the perfect, heartwarming family film if it wasn't for two main problems: 1) The movie fails to show any resolution with the main character's daughter. Even after the lessons she's learned from her teenage father in the movie, she's still the same desperate-for-love daughter by the end. 2) There is absolutely no relationship between the families other than with the father. The main character moved out of the house because he and his wife are divorcing, and his children seem to not care at all. Sure, they're cool with their teenage dad, but why do they hate their old dad so much? Also, it seems like the mom doesn't mind that her daughter's dating a sex-addicted ass hole. The couple act sexual and dirty around her, yet the mom seems to not care. I don't think the mom actually speaks to the daughter at all, only to her son. Near the end of the movie, the daughter speaks to her mom, but the mom fails to reply. WTF? But those are just little problems that most people will probably fail to notice.",17 Again

However right from the start I just has a sense that I had seen everything in this before, for example there is a scene where Zac Efron has been knocked out and wakes up thinking it's all been a dream only to discover it is not his wife by his side but his daughter; remind you of the scene from Back To The Future after Marty has been run over... its even filmed using the same camera shots!!!Now I don't want to spoil any more of these moments for people watching at home, but this film represents exactly what's wrong with a majority of Hollywood filmmakers, they are given money to recreate films that have been made. Next week a remake of Death At A Funeral comes out and people are already raving about its originality with no idea that a probably better version was released 3 years ago.Anyway that was off topic, in conclusion I would say that 17 Again is the sort of film you should take a girl to see on a first date... it's easy to watch you'll both get enjoyment from it and it has a happy ending, its just a shame that like so many others it lacks creativity or actually any point at all. 4/10",17 Again

He is met one old clerical staff in his old school, and to time travel to the old days.This is a story mixed by comedy and romance. The main actor, Zac Efron is very famous in Japan. I watched his movie at the time, in high school music lessons before. This movie is also interesting. If I can time travel to the past time, I also wants to return the days when I was seventeen years old. From this movie, I remember the days I enjoy my high school time very much. If he cannot be returned the past time, he must not be recognized his daughter and son deeply. In the high school time, I am also worried about light cares and great ones like human relations, family problem, and future path. Seventeen is really important time for me. On the other hands, people cannot expect the future exactly, and we cannot returns the past time in reality. Therefore, I want to do my best at all things and don't want to regret later.This movie is very interesting. All people may be sympathized with the problem which happens to some part of this story. However, it is not including gloomy feelings. The film actually makes people feel refreshed after watching it. I really recommend you to watch this movie.",17 Again
134,jhunt709,A strong development for Efron's career...,9,14 August 2009,"Still riding on the undeniable success of the 'High School Musical' franchise, Zac Efron steps aside the musical genre to front comedy '17 Again', in which he plays the younger counterpart of a moody thirty-something year old who spends his days regretting not following his own dreams as a teenager in order to stand by his pregnant girlfriend. Mike O'Donnell, played by both Zac Efron and Matthew Perry (with an ability that credits them both as comic actors), is given the chance to change his life for the better when a strange accident leads to his becoming a teenager once again.The surprise for this viewer with '17 Again' was that the content and tone of the film was in considerable contrast to how I originally perceived the package; from the use of Disney's current poster boy to the concept of the film itself, the movie on paper could read like an exercise in crowd-pleasing for the masses of Efron's female fans that its release would be bound to attract. However, any fear of a squeaky clean ninety minutes quickly subsides when the reason for central character Mike O'Donnell's misery is revealed, alongside the emergence of themes such as sexual relationships and family responsibility. Amongst the more clever aspects of the film was the wise use of Efron's star status. Efron shows off his body just enough to please his admirers, though not nearly enough to alienate viewers such as myself who aren't that way inclined towards him. He is quickly making a name for himself as his acting chops are now giving him a reputation that stands for something besides his image; those of the opinion that he is good for nothing more than Disney television movies may be slowly forced to change their minds. The nature of his character; a father living amongst his children in a similar state of adolescence is also taken good advantage of in several key scenes where the younger Mike O'Donnell, still essentially an adult, tackles problems amongst the real schoolchildren like only a father would. It is this slant on proceedings that keeps the film fresh, saving it from succumbing to its predictable premise. Ultimately, '17 Again' plays like an enjoyable teen comedy, constantly either funny or sentimental with a witty script and hearty performances from all involved. It is certainly a strong development for Efron's career, and thankfully it dulls his Disney sheen whilst strengthening his credibility as a family-friendly box office draw. Having seen this on the big and small screens, I certainly recommend it for home theatre viewing, though maybe not for families uncomfortable with facing typical teenage content together.9/10",17 Again

136,yora217,17 Again Review,7,11 October 2010,"I remember seeing this movie all over the place when it came out on DVD. Everybody was saying it was the new zac efron movie, and since im not really a Zac Efron fan, i decided to rent the movie and check it out. I gotta admit, it was alittle better then what i expected. The plot overall is not really something i was all too impressed of, it was pretty straightforward, guy is bored with life, becomes 17 again for unknown reasons which are never explained, and learns the lesson of what really matters in life. For acting, i didn't no a lot of the actors very well, about the only three i can say im familiar with is Zac Efron, Sterling Knight from Sunny with a chance, and Michelle Trachtenberg from Buffy the vampire slayer. As far as acting goes, Zac owned this movie, he is showing that he can mature up to his role and not be like how he is in high school musical, ill definitely look forward to where his career takes him now that hes gone from Disney. Sterling Knight was OK as the son of Zac, his char serves as a sort of friend and guidance to Zac so yeah, he does what he does, nothing more nothing less. Michelle is about the same, so yeah my point is Zac is the real star of the movie. So for my final point, its a good movie, its definitely worth a rental, if your a fan of Zac Efron, definitely go out and buy it, if not, just rent it. Its not a must see movie, but it gets the job done.",17 Again
137,xaniver,Fun and good for a laugh,7,5 October 2014,"I don't really do comedy. Most comedies leave me rolling my eyes rather than laughing, but this somehow made me smile throughout. Zac Efron might not be about to win an Oscar but he definitely knows how to pull off quirky comedy and does it well in this movie as an older man trapped in a teenage body. If you think it bears a passing resemblance to High School Musical you might be right given Efron's floppy bangs and basketball attire, but this movie is about a lot more than raging hormones and who to take to the promo. The banter between Efron and Thomas Lennon is particularly well done with a few wry moments that had me chuckling.This movie isn't meant to be taken seriously and for a comedy, it has a rather sweet message, almost poignant actually, and a satisfying conclusion.",17 Again
138,JabbaTheHans,Enjoyable movie which induces you to reflect (if your'e 40+ish y.o.),8,7 September 2018,"This is a movie that can easily be enjoyed by both teens and adults (best watched as a family). The plot is simple, yet very solid. The characters act in a believable, realistic manner, while most of the actors did really great. What's really good IMO is that the movie will not only entertain you, but will also make you reflect on how you spent your life so far. It will induce you to revisit hopes and dreams that you have forgotten or abandoned because of the trivialities your younger self had to face. For teens, this movie will also touch on traditional values without shoving it down your throat.Highly recommended, underrated movie.",17 Again
139,Mis_Behavin,Worth A Look,6,18 January 2012,"I watched this last night, not really expecting very much, but I like Matthew Perry and the whole 'swapping bodies/age' concept so thought it would be OK.It's certainly not the best of the bunch - I think that award will always belong to Big for me personally, but it's a lot better than I thought it would be and I was surprised at how good Zac Effron was too. I've never really paid him much attention before, being in my late 20's I'm not really in the target audience for his previous offerings! He's a surprisingly good actor and what I was particularly impressed by was how he nailed Matthew Perry's mannerisms and speech style and fed them into his portrayal of 'Young Mike'. Very Clever.Matthew Perry was actually slightly miscast in this I thought, but unfortunately, I think the ghost of Chandler Bing will follow him throughout his career and he may seem out of place no matter what he does.The storyline has a few whopping holes in it - I spent half the movie trying to work out how Scarlett supposedly fell pregnant in '89, yet 20 years later her child was still in High School? Never mind though, it was a perfectly reasonable piece of fluff to while away a couple of hours and sometimes you don't need to look any deeper than that!",17 Again
140,franceseca_orr,A genuinely good teen film. Something this generation has been lacking...,10,10 April 2009,"I've just returned from the cinema after watching this film and I have to say, my friends and I laughed like a bunch of hyenas (probably to the annoyance of anyone behind us) all the way through it. The story of course is nothing original, but you knew that going in, and yes, there are some seemingly ridiculous or stereotypical character setups, again acknowledged beforehand, but the direction and the acting, more than makes up for this. Most of the actors, especially Efron, who proves he's definitely not just a wanna-be pretty boy and actually stores away some talent, play their parts well. Matthew Perry seemed slightly misplaced, even if he was the reason I went to see the film in the first place. Not to mention the director being Burr Steers who directed one of my favourite films. I could kind of tell how in the wrong hands this movie could have been embarrassingly bad, but Steers manages to balance the right amount of comedy with drama and turn it into something really worth seeing. Efron blew me away. I have to say, I didn't see it coming, and I never thought I'd say such a sentence, but this boy can do better than TV Disney movies. I'm kind of glad he has turned down re-make, Footloose, not only because it's a 're-make of footloose'.On the negative side of things the writing lacked in terms of Mark's relationship with his daughter. The daughter didn't really seem to have a personality, now I'm not totally sure if this is down to Trachtenbergs terrible acting (one of very little who deliver poor performances actually) or poor character development but something was wrong there.I don't really rate the cinematography, but I don't think it's something to be taken quite seriously in teen films. It's all about the characters and the comedy - but what was up with that image of Zac right before 'Mark' falls into the water? Some interesting choices of music. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. Quite moving and Mark is a much more 3 dimensional, well developed character than most PG-13 rated movies you see. I genuinely cared about him, where as, even in Mean Girls, (which is particularly hilarious and legendary as far as contemporary teen films go) I didn't care too much for any of the characters. It's probably because this film went that little bit further than most and took itself seriously, if only for parts of the movie. It makes a big difference.So, yeah, '17 Again', fairly well written, hilarious, well and sometimes greatly acted and awesome direction for the most part, and a genuinely good, enjoyable and moving film. Take a look and you'll probably be surprised... but don't go in hoping for anything Oscar worthy. I get the impression there is only so much a director can do with a film like '17 Again' and he did it alright.Trustworthy director and impressive lead, I'd say. Can make all the difference.p.s. I'd also watch out for that Sterling Knight actor - he plays Marks awkward son. He gave a genuinely good performance also.",17 Again
141,jmason72-1,Somebody hasn't done their maths,4,12 April 2009,"Okay, the plot goes something like this: 37 year man thinks he was tops when he was 17 and magically goes back to being 17. I don't mind suspending disbelief but boy somebody can't do maths. When Mike was 17, he gets his girlfriend pregnant. But when he goes back to being 17, his daughter is in the same class? Huh? That would make her 19 or 20 - not 17!! And all the so-called 37 year-olds look like they are 47. I'm actually 37 and none of my friends the same age as me look as old as those people. And Mike keeps complaining about feeling really old and moving slowly when he is 37. What? You're only 37! Not 47 or 57! What the? And Matthew Perry and Zac Ephron look like they are from significantly different genetic backgrounds and they look nothing alike! And Matthew Perry is about 10ft taller than Zac Ephron. So the whole movie is just weird. Perry was just weird and creepy. They should have just cast someone who actually looked something like Zac as they did with other characters who are portrayed as their younger selves. And then there is Michelle Tractenberg who is always worth watching and pretty much out acts everybody else as Mike's daughter. Uh, hello, Michelle clearly hasn't been 17 for quite some time. And at one point, her younger brother ends up in the same class as Mike. This movie is more boring than fun. However, Thomas Lennon as the sidekick is truly hilarious and steals every seen. My 4 stars are all for him.As for Zac Ephron, well, he's playing the same character again. I liked him in High School Musical and Hairspray - but he sucked in this movie. As his wife says to him in one seen - you are a weird 'man-boy'. Yup, just about sums up this movie. And women in their 40s kissing boys in their teens is just as creepy as the other way around. Shudder! Leslie Mann, what were you thinking?This is worth getting out on DVD for Thomas Lennon alone. If you're into Zac, it's not going to make you love him more. If you're into Matthew Perry - my guess is that you won't be after this. All in all, a very ordinary film.",17 Again
142,celticjunkie,Zac Efron is actually a good actor!,8,25 August 2009,"Very ""feel good"" movie and (like many viewers have said) a pleasant surprise! I was wondering if the stale premise of a character returning to the past to live life over again would ruin the enjoyment of this film, but it did not. The script is very fresh and witty and the cast is excellent. Lots of laughs, especially between Zac Efron and his now-grown best buddy (Thomas Lennon), and between the buddy and the pretty high school principal (Melora Hardin from ""The Office""). I was impressed with Zac Efron, whom I have only seen in HSM and felt he was just a pretty face, but the guy can act.There are a few minor problems, though, starting with the fact that the handsome Efron looks not at all like the comparatively homely Matthew Perry. And they are supposedly the same guy. Sorry, but no amount of life stress is going to make Efron's face look like Perry's. The next problem is that if the main characters (Perry and Leslie Mann) married 20 years ago because she got pregnant, why are their kids no older than 18?? I also had a problem with Hunter Parrish (the son from ""Weeds"") playing the proverbial bad boy/bully in the film -- despite the bleached blonde hair, he looks too similar to Efron and he is also no bad-ass, not in the least.OK, so overall, I would have to say this is a funny and entertaining movie and definitely worth the time.",17 Again
143,Dan-I-am,Forgettable film strictly for teenage girls,4,9 April 2009,"17 Again takes off where most High School Musicals finish, Effron dancing around while shooting hoops on the basketball court. A scene simply there to make most teenage girls squeal and so the rest of the film follows this formula.Mike O'Donnell (Matthew Perry) wishes that he could somehow change his past, go to college as he dreamed, play basketball and live happily ever after. This isn't the case and so he lives his life miserably until the day when an unexplained janitor happens to fall into a river whilst luring Mike in with him. The Director doesn't care about how or why this happened but is focused on making Effron have as much screen time as possible.From there its the usual time changing film, person gets changed, person is scared and doesn't know what to do, person is told by someone the reason why they may have been changed, person realises this and sets out to make this change, person thinks there doing really well and believes that they are fulfilling their task, person stuffs everything up and so on.Effron knows that the film is focused on him and tries to put everything into his performance. He can be funny, yet annoying and unless your a huge fan will think that his performance is extremely fake. Matthew Perry does not need to do anything here but simply be there, and isn't given much screen time at all, once again trying to show off Effron. Thomas Lennon as Mike's best friend is funny but he also over acts and at times you can;t help but feel he has had much too much screen time.Overall, 17 Again is more focused on Zac Effron's talent than plot or jokes. Although it isn't a complete train wreck of a film, it isn't memorable and the only ones that will enjoy it are teenage girls who are fanatics of Effron. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother or if so look for it on DVD.",17 Again
144,TopperHarley29,Did I really watch the same movie?,2,20 December 2012,"I really can't stand Zac Efron, but people were saying it was good, so I watched it. What a big mistake that was. The plot of the movie has already been done a hundred times and it wouldn't bother me so much if the movie was funny. It's not. The jokes are cliché, predictable, recycled and uninspired. Bottom line: I didn't laugh once. People said Zac Efron was good in this movie, but I thought he was terrible. He was so bad that he made me miss Matthew Perry's character and he wasn't that great either. Pretty much all the characters are unlikable in this movie and I don't know if it's just me, but I found this movie very sappy. If you don't like Zac Efron then don't watch this movie because there's a chance that you won't like it. Everyone else can have it.",17 Again

Anyway, moving on... At first I couldn't understand why so many teenage girls who absolutely adore Zac didn't like this movie, (my own 15 year old daughter among them). And then it dawned on me: it's because Zac's love interest is not another teenage girl, it's an older woman!As an older woman myself, I can totally understand why Scarlet was starting to fall for Mark, as it was clearly showed in the dance scene. Which was done beautifully, and Zac Efron can take most of the credit for it. 17 Again has its charms, it was never going to be a great movie, but it's certainly entertaining and non demanding. And to all those people out there who are just rubbishing Zac's performance to the max, give the guy a break, he is just young and you can hardly fault him for that.Ah... just before I go, if kids in America behave like that in the classroom, I must say that we are way better off in our not so rich, not so important, way smaller and very beautiful New Zealand!",17 Again
146,bobbiwibble,Really not a bad film at all,7,29 June 2016,"I bought this at a charity sale where dvds were 50p each or 3 for £1. This was the 3rd, so it was essentially free and I thought it might be fun to take to a wine-and-takeaway night. This isn't a great film, and it's not a film that will stand the test of time, but it was notably hard to mock, and if 3 drunk 20- somethings can't find much to laugh at in a film like this then the good must outweigh the bad. I feel like this would be a standard film that I would never even have noticed if it wasn't for the inclusion of Efron in the post-HSM phase. I bet most HSM fans didn't even enjoy it, because it definitely seems like it wasn't aimed at them. If it wasn't for the creepy Disney movies (HSM, camp rock, they are all hilarious for all the wrong reasons) I would never have looked down on this film. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I shouldn't have. It's not a standard romcom because it managed to find a new twist on the genre, which should be lauded. And it's not just a vehicle for Efron, which is a bonus. Maybe 7/10 is too high, maybe it's just a reaction to the fact I expected it to be truly godawful. But most dvds get watched once and then returned to the exact same stall that I got them from, and this one didn't.",17 Again
147,leumas3765,"Most hilarious basketball scenes since ""Teen Wolf""",7,23 July 2009,"I had no intention of watching this movie when it was featured on my return flight, but the girl next to me watched it on her digi-player before the airline projected it, and it looked at least worth plugging in my headphones for. I wasn't disappointed.The plot, as I understood it: 1989 Zac Efron, sporting a hairstyle that NOBODY wore back then, is playing in The Big Game. For some reason, judging by the dimensions of the court, they are playing in a junior high school gym. The coach exerts zero discipline over his team of all-white, 5'10"" players, and they are allowed to mingle with and even smooch girls DURING the pre-game huddle.Zac's girlfriend chooses the biggest moment of his life to that point to drop the news that she is pregnant (although because this is a ""family friendly movie, the audience is left to infer that.) Zac decides to quit basketball before the game starts to be there for his baby, even though it won't be born for approximately another 8 months. 20 years later, he is miserable at home and at work, so the moral, as always, is ""Always abandon your baby's mother. Your life will suck otherwise."" Matthew Perry was cast to portray Zac Effron 20 years in the future, a curious choice, since Luke Perry probably looks more like Zac Effron. I can only conclude that obvious choice for this role Rob Lowe was (a) not available or (b) uncomfortable starring in a movie with his real-life bastard son.The ""trading places"" plot hasn't been seen in thousands of movies, but probably at least hundreds of them. It's compelling because who doesn't wish he could go back in time with wisdom and right past wrongs? Anyway, it isn't worth summarizing this movie because this is one of those movies you've seen even if you haven't.A few quirks are worth pointing out though: Matthew Perry's life was screwed because he got his high school girlfriend pregnant when he was a senior, but 20 years later, his daughter is a senior in high school? Did she repeat a few grades? The principal in this movie is the same actress who portrays Michael Scott's Girlfriend on ""The Office"" playing the EXACT SAME ROLE in this movie, as the hot authority figure who is given to incredible lapses in judgment and falling for dorks when she could get any man she desires. How pigeonholed is that actress? Up 6 with 1:19 to go, The Hayden Warriors' opts against any kind of clock-eating 4-corners offense. The Warriors counter by not intentionally fouling to stop the clock, or maybe that was the plan but the players were all smooching their girlfriends when the coach drew up that play. Not to be outdone, the opponent's coach doesn't call timeout after when the game is slipping away from him. It's as if we're watching action from the old ""Double Dribble"" game on the original Nintendo.As part of the ""Happy Ending Everything Turns Out OK"" resolution, Chandler Bing is hired to take over for the coach at Hayden High. Apparently in California, you don't need to be a licensed teacher to hold a head coaching position as you do in most other states. Then again, maybe working as a Pharmaceudical Sales Rep for 16 years, Chandler has access to P.E.D.s that will give his team the edge.I recommend this movie if you can see it for free. There are worse selections if you are hurtling through the sky at 34,000 feet. It's also suitable if you're trapped at a multi-generational family event (such as the weekend after Thanksgiving)and you need entertainment that's guaranteed not to offend anyone.",17 Again

In addition, he really isn't funny and the whole ""pretty-boy"" attitude is just irritating. There was really no moral to it and it just wasn't entertaining at all. The character that plays the geeky friend isn't cute or funny; in fact, I really want to punch him in the face repeatedly. Granted, I assumed that it would be a cute movie for little kids. It isn't. With some of the implications and language used in the movie it's evident that the movie was ""meant"" for teenagers. It did not, however, relate to any part of my teenage life, nor did it relate to any one else's that I know. It's a fact that if Zac Efron wasn't in the movie, it would not be remotely popular. Luckily, his smile is able to divert people's attention away from the fact that he has the acting skills of a mentally disabled 9 year old.

OK, that was a bit ambiguous but stay focused. This movie wasn't like that. When it came close to romantic moments I was cringing out of awkwardness of the moment and looking away from the screen, it was that awkward.

But it wasn't the case.This Movie really proved that Efron is not an Amateur who just dances and sings a lot. It proved he is a skilled Actor and his acting brought back memories of Chandler in Friends. In some places, he seemed so much like Matthew Perry which is difficult to pull off for most Amateur actors.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 out of 10 is because some people I watched this movie with believed it had an 'abrupt ending' but I thought you can't have too much of a good thing.",17 Again

No special magics, no bumps on the head, no gamma rays.It's not a waste of time, check it out.",17 Again

WRONG this movie sucked big time it was just a snore fest with no point of existence. Along with being boring, the characters are under developed, the story is a mess, 95% of the jokes are either unfunny or don't make sense and the only thing that kept my eyes on the screen was obviously Zac but even then his character Mike seemed like a throw away character rather than the main character oh wait there's the seen where older mike got fired but guess what that was the only other remotely entertaining thing in this movie.

159,sprintz1132,Efron sells it,6,18 April 2009,"What has happened to Matthew Perry's career? That's, I'm assuming, the question on a lot of people's minds. The Friends alum had a total screen time of approximately 10 minutes or so, before relinquishing the spotlight to High School Musical refugee, Zac Efron. The Disney baby wisely jumped the East High ship before it completely submerged and has graduated to playing Mike O'Donnell, who apparently is supposed to resemble Matthew Perry as a teenager. No offense to Perry, but I seriously doubt that he looked anything like the swaggering, blue-eyed dynamo that is Zac Efron. Granted, the film still has a distinctly Disney stink to it, but none the less, I suppose it's not a bad film for Efron to further his movie career with. The makers of 17 Again certainly know their audience as Efron was shirtless within the first 30 seconds of the movie shooting hoops and, of course, drenched in sweat. By doing this, he's not exactly taking a giant step away from playing Troy Bolton (his HSM alter-ego) who lived his life with a basketball in his hand, but none the less, the sharp shooter is supposedly Mike O'Donnell when he was in high school. After discovering his girlfriend, Scarlett, was pregnant, he throws away his chances of going to college on a basketball scholarship and in a romantic leap, offers to marry Scarlett and take care of their child. Mike O'Donnell twenty years later, though, is an under-appreciated salesman who is living with his best friend Ned (a humorous Thomas Lennon) because he's divorcing his wife and mother of his two kids, Maggie and Alex (Michelle Trachtenberg and Sterling Knight). Apparently Mike's life is so unbearable that he, in a very cliché ridden exchange with a janitor during a walk through his old high school, laments that he wish he'd had it to ""do all over again."" In a markedly It's a Wonderful Life moment, Mike attempts to stop a man who looks as though he's about to commit suicide (surprise, it's the janitor from school!) and in turn, falls into a swirling vortex of terror that, when people fall into it, they turn into Zac Efron. Naturally, the first thing Mike does when he's his 17 year old self is throw on an Ed Hardy t-shirt and head straight back to high school. When he does, he discovers some not so savory things about his kids, as in, his daughter is dating the school bully and his son is the victim of some harassment involving being duct taped to a toilet. In the process of trying to turn his kids back in the right direction, Mike inadvertently makes his daughter fall in love with him (yuck) and skyrockets his son up the popularity food chain by helping him make the basketball team. He makes some incredibly inappropriate but misguided advances on adult Scarlett (Leslie Mann, who I can't imagine any guy wanting to divorce) but she wisely shoots him down on the basis that he is only a teenager. During his adventures as his teenage self, Mike discovers that he's been a lousy father and a bad husband. He also realizes exactly why he threw away his hoop dreams for Scarlett. (I won't give away the ending, but I promise, you can see it coming a mile away). There have been a whole lot of body-switching comedies in the history of cinema, and this one was no different in terms of the comedic style. Most of the laughs come from the awkwardness of a dad trying to act like a teenager, which has officially been dubbed (by me) lazy humor. Efron does what he can with the script (that was clearly written in three weeks considering how much the beginning and end were rushed) and he succeeds in nearly putting me and half of America into a good-looks induced coma. Leslie Mann is charming as usual, Thomas Lennon gets some laughs by playing the token nerdy guy, and Mike's children, Trachtenberg and Knight, have pleasant enough screen presences. Thanks to the skinny jeaned aficionado, Zac Efron, 17 Again is going to make a lot of money. Put a handsome enough guy into a lead role and people will basically see anything. 17 Again doesn't try to be what it's not (and I respect that) but then again, it also isn't much. It's littered with half-baked clichés and the storyline itself doesn't have nearly enough momentum to make it through a whole movie without crashing and burning. Basically, this movie will do an excellent job in feeding the masses of teenage girls (including myself) who will inevitably flock to this movie just to get a glimpse of their beloved shining star. My grade: C+",17 Again
160,penncare,Pleasantly Surprised,8,22 April 2009,"The storyline was very well done and enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. Keep an open mind and you will enjoy the movie.Zac Efron did a really decent acting job. I honestly thought it would be High School Musical-like but it turned out to be a nice movie to watch. If he keeps up the good work and takes it to the next level, he can really be an A level quality star. Zac is no Matthew Macfadden yet but there is potential.There are two recasts I would have done. Matthew Perry wasn't fully right for this role. He has a comedic bent but it wasn't used at all in this movie - hence a total waste and was a mismatch from a character perspective. I think John Stamos would have been better. Also Michelle Trachtenberg playing the teenager was a bit much. Trachtenberg is a solid actress but for a teenager, a different actress would have been better.It is a very nice movie and I usually rate a movie on whether it's worth paying full price, matinée, video store, Netflix or don't bother. The movie was worth paying full price.",17 Again

I laughed throughout the movie, watched it with whole family and we all loved it. The main young actor ZAc Efron played well surprinsingly, hopefully for him he'll be offered other interesting roles like this one, it is a pity that Matthew Perry had only a small role, the pretend dad was hilarious, the scene with Mark's kids and wife were predictable but very funny overall.

This movie was pretty interesting, and I think it was better than the original. There were a few awkward scenes, like when the daughter was acting like a lion, but overall, the movie wasn't that bad. I give it nine stars because it is good for a Zac Effron movie. If I was grading it on the same standard as other movies, it would probably be a 7 star movie. If you were considering seeing this movie, I actually think you should. Zac Effron was fantastic, as was the plot of the story. Matthew Perry was OK also. This movie is not a must see, but if you are looking for something to do on a rainy Saturday, this is a good way to spend your time. It has a happy ending, which is really cliché, but most movies are. See this movie. It is actually really good.

I shall try to shirk the criticism away slowly and appreciate the finer aspects of any movie. Any movie will do at this time except 17 again. Do I begin with the pansy looking Efron who probably looked natural prettily dancing with the cheerleaders than he did as the lead actor. I am really suspicious of girls who dig Efron. Anyway that makes up for an entirely different discussion and I shall not stray any further until I am done butchering and battering this movie to bits. Did I promise not to be too harsh again? Well I will try. Be sure to fuse your logic bulb. If you don't the director will anyway. There are too many ridiculous situations and you might overload your brain with it looking for sense. Like the scene, when the 17 again Mike O'Donnell (Efron) appears before his wife and children and they fail to recognize him. OK we have to give them the benefit of doubt. Perry to Efron is an unimaginable physical transformation even with plastic surgery. He got shorter did he at 17? But what about corny reminders Mike O' Donnell gives them by rehashing the same dialogues. Poor memory can be attributed to old age and we shall spare the wife (Leslie Mann). Not yet! The script writer had another plot in mind. As the wife (Leslie Mann) looks into her high school year book the picture still doesn't convince her that Efron is her husband. Finally it is Efron's gesture at the championship game that makes her realize who he really is. Doh! That by far is the most ridiculously scripted part of the movie and I am still reeling under it.Although I must admit there was this particular scene when I thought I saw a sudden reflection of Perry in Efron and another one where his voice modulated to suit Perry. Those must have been genuine attempt on Efron's part. I must have been watching too closely nonetheless his effort hasn't gone unnoticed. Efron you are no eye candy to me Sterling Knight does a better job at that. At least he looks 17! Is it just me or did anyone else notice how Efron looks squint eyed.Perry doesn't get enough screen time so it wouldn't be fair to comment. His hefty eye bags sure do convince us about how old he's gotten. The whole LOTR gimmick was hilariously received by the audience (there were only 3 other jobless people with me). The movie does deliver a message in the end for what it is worth which may tug at the hearts of a few. Not all of us would do things differently if we had the chance and if those moments were ones we savored. Though eventually with time those moments may seem like our weaknesses.",17 Again

Cinematically it was very simple and as a result easy to both watch and follow. Surprisingly, to me at least, Zac Efron managed to carry this film, showing to viewers that he is capable of much more than High School Musical seemed to limit him to. Now that being said, certain scenes did play directly off of what made him successful in the High School Musical series -that being choreographed dance, but it was not overdone. The remainder of the cast did an excellent job supporting Zac's character and managed to provide elements of both blatant and timing-based comedy. I would recommend watching this film if you are ever looking for a light-hearted night at home, since it requires little to no active thinking and manages to put a smile on your face on several occasions. It's no Oscar contender, but it's definitely enjoyable for all ages.",17 Again

It's defiantly an eye-opener and makes you think about your life and your past. Zac Efron really surprised me because being a Disney channel star and all, i didn't expect so much from him but he did amazing. He even cried and kissed an older woman! Oh, and that nice make-out scene in the beginning was great too. The theme of this movie was not like any typical high-school movie where someone's popular and their's the jocks and cheerleaders. This movie had that but in a more realistic way. They showed how someone can make a difference to teens and how peer pressure is getting worse nowadays.

The cast is also very good for this movie, though I felt Michelle Trachtenberg's character was a bit underplayed and hard to relate to. I don't think the Zac and Michelle combination worked out. I could've dealt with a little less romance between Zac and Leslie but what the hay, those were the funniest and most heartwarming moments. I've always adored Leslie's acting. She brightens up the screen. Sterling Knight was surprisingly adorable with really hilarious expressions.A real plus in this movie is the script. It makes the movie worth watching over again unlike some other teen movies. I really enjoyed the script and the way it was delivered. Zac Efron was amazing, it caught me by surprise, 'You little punk... you don't talk to him that way...', and the basketball tirade that follows, was brilliantly and effortlessly executed. It was a joy to watch.I think the slapping thing was the only part I'd like to fast forward. One slap would suffice. Maybe Zac's a fan of Johnny Depp, he was even trying to imitate Jack Sparrow but I'd beg Zac not to do it again, it wasn't funny, it was horrible.

169,csabarish,Efron is star material,7,9 July 2009,"Zac Efron comes of age in 17 again and proves he is star material! But haven't we known that for a couple of years already? I caught the original High School Musical while channel surfing and found it amusing enough to pass an innocent Sunday morn. The boy, I remember thinking, was attractive. But this was before the franchise had become a worldwide phenomena and a was a few months from hitting Indian media.In the following couple of years he has done more musicals (HSMs and Hairspray) but 17 Again is his first pure comedy, more like a romantic comedy, and also his first solo lead role. It was definitely not so much an acting challenge as a test of his ability to carry an entire movie alone. And boy did he pass? In virtually every frame of the ninety odd minutes of the film camera is either focused on Efron's blue eyes or capturing the shade of his tresses at different angles. The shirtless torso shot is done away with right at the beginning. While a few dialogs are interspersed among costume and hair style changes.Story, yes there is some of it. There is a whole gravy about teen pregnancy, doing the right thing (giving up college to marry), mid-life crisis, losing promotion to bimbo, losing wife to divorce. Sigh...A weird old janitor, time travel, in high school with his own kids, getting their lives on track, wooing his own wife and (this is nauseating) his own daughter trying to make out with him. Phew... there I get that out of the way.The whole coming to realize his life's (and wife's) worth is just filler, as is a silly comic element (ah you'll know which when you watch it) just to stretch the run time. You could just say this movie is an excuse to watch Zac Efron for almost one hour and half, which is in fact its redeeming trait. The actor does not have to stretch here, he just has to stay consistent, which he manages. Of course he has to look good too, even in a ridiculous hair style at the start; check. And there is enough going on in the periphery to not make the time especially trying; (with some reluctance) check.All in all the movie achieves what it set out to and so does the teen heartthrob. He had to prove his star potential, ability to carry a movie and draw crowds, he did all that with only very little help from the movie itself. So now the big studios could provide him with better writers, directors and perhaps even trust him with some prestige projects. If Shia can get to be in blockbusters, Zac can definitely be there. I mean, Meagan Fox and robots pull in the guys, Zac Efron their girlfriends, both stars in skimpy clothes washing a car and we have the biggest blockbuster date movie ever.",17 Again

I think that if this comedy had so much marketing as ""The Hangover"" or"" The Proposal"" , it would be on top ten grossing films in the world. Jason Filardi once again proved why he is one of the best in writing comedies , but he is also great at drama .The scene, when Zac Efron is reading his letter to Leslie Mann or on the first scene , when he leaves the court and runs after her , are very nice and dramatic . Jason's magic screenplay is the key of success . Thommas Lennon was the best comedian in this movie and Zac Efron was the best actor of this.

174,mk-2222,We've all seen this movie before!,4,19 April 2009,"I'm starting to suspect that Hollywood no longer uses actual, human screenwriters to create their movies. After watching years of the same, recycled trash, I'm starting to think that they now use a screenplay-writing machine to do it. This machine works very simply. A producer will enter the main character's name, one problem they are facing, and one 'gimmick' (an unusual plot twist often used as a selling point for the film), and hey presto! - out pops a completed, and entirely unoriginal screenplay. Such is the case for 17 Again. Mike O'Donnell is a depressed suburban father (sounds familiar already, doesn't it?) whose wife is divorcing him, kids can't stand him, and who just got passed over for a promotion. As the movie progressed, it started to seem very, very familiar - a crippling combination of unoriginal jokes, stereotypical characters and recycled plot devices. My friends and I started to grin and sneeringly guess what was going to happen later in the film, and guess what: most of the time, we were right.We've all seen this movie before - it's been pieced together from the discarded carcasses of films past, by a flock of vultures seemingly so unaccustomed to originality in film-making that they have been rendered unable to create any plot twist even slightly unexpected or interesting. And don't even get me started on Zac Efron's acting (or lack of such).Two small good things. Out of the dozens of jokes thrown at us, a select few - maybe five - were genuinely hilarious. Other than that, though, the humor relied on the the faux-improvised, overly-awkward style of comedy popularized by Seth Rogen and co. It doesn't work here. The other highlight, of course, was Matthew Perry. He's the man, and an excellent comic actor, but his short on-screen time was not enough to salvage this unoriginal, unfunny, and worst of all boring attempt at light entertainment. Perhaps if the film had eliminated the dramatic aspects and stuck to being a comedy, it could have succeeded, but this is one movie I certainly would not want to see again.",17 Again

The story is weak but what makes it watchable is the talent of Zack Efron, Leslie Mann, and Michelle Trachtenberg. I haven't seen any of Zack Efron's other work but his portrayal of Mike as an adult and parent is spot on and much better than that of Matthew Perry, who in my opinion is a weak actor and failed to give Mike any personality, Efron breaths life into the character giving him dimension and personality and proving he is not just Hollywood's newest pretty face. Mann is also believable and terrific in her role as Scarlet. Trachtenberg who I've never seen do more than play an average teen, shows a great funny bone in the scene where Maggie tries to seduce Mike.One amusing thing on the play of time, is that even though its been twenty years since Scarlet got pregnant Maggie is only seventeen or eighteen.",17 Again

Will see again... 17 Again.",17 Again

However, it's great movie to watch when you have family parties or a hangout with friends. It will give you a good laugh and is entertaining.It's not a bad movie and will keep the audience interested. Go grab some food, come back, and watch it. It's interesting enough to know what's happening and to see it until the end.Also a great movie for almost all ages. I recommend those who are ages 13+ to watch it, not only because it's rated PG-13, but because I think that that age group will be able to understand it and get a good laugh out of it.",17 Again

I settled down in my seat for the duration and the first few scenes showing Efron as a high school basketball player had me groaning inwardly as I assumed that this was going to be another predictable high school/age swap film of the type that has been done so many times before - and really isn't the sort of film I would choose to see anyway. Not a promising start. However, I was pleasantly surprised by 17 Again. It was witty and well acted and made me laugh out loud - not something I often do even when I appreciate the humour in a film.This film's appeal is also strengthened by the acting of the supporting characters as well as the main ones - Thomas Lennon's character was particularly well delivered. I found no fault with Zac Efron's acting in this and I enjoyed his performance in Hairspray but it would be interesting to see him in a serious grown up dramatic role.",17 Again

189,TheLiterSide,So Which is it?,5,16 August 2010,"'17 Again' tells the story of Mike O'Donnell, a man in his mid-thirties who gave up his dream of going to college in replacement of raising his child with Scarlett. Now, with his kids loathing the thought of being around him and his wife in the process of leaving him, he gets a chance at revisiting a time of his life that he saw to be his ""glory days"".But what exactly is '17 Again' trying to be, a comedy or a romance film? One could usually classify this as a romantic comedy but this is where it falls short. In most romantic comedies the plot is focused on one track that deals with romance while funny things happen in the process (E.G.: There's Something About Mary, Can't Hardly Wait, etc.). This film however seems to sit on the fence. Half of the time it tries to make flat and awkward jokes about the humorous perspectives of teenage life while the other time focusing on rekindling the romance of the main character. To add to the confusion is the side-plot between Mike and his children. Throughout 5/8th of the movie the story focuses on the relationship he has with his son and helping him achieve his goal while almost completely ignoring his daughter (there are a few attempts but she is seen only as a minor character who is in a few scenes and remains silent throughout most of them). After that it suddenly jumps to dealing solely with his daughter (Michelle Trachtenberg) who goes from being silent to angry to very talkative and keen towards him. Her personality changes so much that it is difficult to imagine that she is the same person in the beginning of the film but the movie itself makes her character flawed in that they rush her character through at such a fast pace that the viewer cannot help but try to take it in all at once. But she is only focused on for a short amount of time before the focus changes again in the last twenty minutes of the film to the pure romantic genre. The side-plots themselves get a brief nod before the movie ends on a low note. But it is still not finished; the final subplot which in itself can be considered a lackluster romantic comedy is so frantically absurd that it fails to amuse. Once again it goes from completely flawed and there being no chemistry between Mike's friend Ned and the principal of the high school to one line sparking an entire change. Since this transition happens so abruptly and so late in the film the viewer cannot forget all of the failed attempts before this and it holds back any sort of plausibility that this relationship has. And, just like with the main plot, it seems to bounce back and forth in whether or not the relationship will work out with there being an almost deus-ex-machina sort of answer to it thrown into the last three minutes of the film.Besides the plot the characters are portrayed only as well as the actors who portray them; which is not very well at all. I do not believe this is the fault of the actors as much as it is the casters of this film who decided to go with people that are familiar to most viewers but the problem that this leads to is hiring 'teenagers' who are in their mid-twenties and adults in their mid thirties who are actually in their late forties, early fifties. The actors and actresses seem out of touch with the way that their youth should be acted out. Teenagers often do not try to form logical and well formulated thoughts; they are primitive and vulgar most times. But this can be argued in that some of the characters are shown to be this way; but it is done in a way that makes adolescents seem like they are little more than self-indulged children who should be treated with hostility and extreme control rather than be talked to and prepped for being young adults. Once again the script plays the roles to an extreme; either too mature or too immature. The final case of flip-flopping can even be seen is with the antagonist (the stereotypical jock bully). While most films will have an antagonist who will make sure that the protagonist falls or fails this one stands on the sidelines most times and makes brief appearances to humiliate Mike. Most times he succeeds but there are no carry-on consequences. Teenagers, especially in a high school setting, will remember humiliation. This high school seems to laugh and then move on as if nothing happened. Because of this the antagonist can do little more than act like a moronic fool and then fall out of the story all together.In the end if you are looking for an average movie to sit and observe (do not expect any strong emotions to come out of this one) then I suggest you watch it once for yourself. But if you have expectations of watching a movie that will be making you laugh or have a teary eyed moment then I recommend passing up this film.",17 Again
190,Tayliepo101,Great movie!!,9,19 April 2009,"This movie was both touching and hilarious. The humor was in exactly the right moments and left me laughing for minutes! Thomas Lennon's character and performance were hilarious! He played the geeky best friend to both young and old Mike! But Zac Efron truly shined in this movie! He was witty, kind, and handsome! This movie was his best performance so far! The actors seemed to have the perfect chemistry together. Zac Efron did a wonderful job of trying to stay connected with his kids, but also trying to keep acting like a true 17 year old. This movie will also bring touching tears. The whole story line called for a few tears, but they were worth it! This movie is a total must see!",17 Again
191,raiwass,So Bad It Was Funny...,4,7 September 2009,"A movie worth seeing, not because it was good, but actually because it was so awful. Mostly, it was a clichéd mess that threw together barely disguised parts of movies such as The Family Man, It's A Wonderful Life, Big...and somewhere in the middle of that, a Star Wars type battle scene involving actual light sabers. The acting was mediocre at times and decent at others. Predictable, the only saving graces were the decent pacing and the occasional comedic moment. The best parts of the movie were the comedic blunders of Mike (Zac Efron)'s adult in a teenage body self as he tried to befriend his children, now fellow high school students, and consistently behaved like a 40 year old man/dad instead of their peer. I would never see it again, but it was bizarre enough to make seeing it once, when you have nothing better to do, worthwhile.",17 Again

Zac has showed so many more levels to himself as an actor, and surely his fan base will continue to extend to now more of an adult audience. However, if you were planning on watching this movie to see Matthew Perry, he consumes a very small amount of screen time.

It has comedy and drama, my sister teared up in one part. Thomas Lennon is pretty funny, Leslie Man always the scene stealer and of course Zac Efron. HE CAN ACT. If you didn't think he was hot before wait until you watch the movie and acts like a real person, not a goody goody fake teenager from ""High School Musical"" though he was the best performer in that movie (I'm not hating on High School Musical I found it entertaining.)

However, it wasn't even that.The only parts of the movie that I actually enjoyed were Efron's sudden change into Perry, and Efron's character's wife failing to recognise him, after he became '17 again'. I found it quite remarkable that ones appearance can be changed so dramatically after ageing a couple of decades. What was almost as incredible is the fact that Efron and his character's wife were childhood sweethearts, but she couldn't even recognise that it was him when he aged back a few years...Even without the major plot holes, though, this movie is dreadful. I couldn't find an actual story anywhere, and I'm not exactly sure what the lead character learned or was supposed to learn about himself, after going back to his teen years.

Back to the film, most 'time-travel'/ 'second chance' films are pretty bad, but this is a great watch to me. Its got a great cast all round. Matthew Perry fits perfectly for the role as does a very underrated Leslie Mann. The kids seem like up and comers too.

The Zac Efron movie! Actually, it was this, Hannah Montana, or Obsessed. Beyonce kinda scares me, (If ya like it than you shoulda put a ring on it!) and Hannah Montana is too predictable for my taste.I kinda cringed at the beginning. Zac Efron's not quite the guy for me, and him with his shirt off and sweaty? Ew. Just ew. I'm not into shirtless, long haired pretty boys. Anyway, this is the first movie where I actually got a major plot point wrong. He doesn't travel back in time, he just becomes seventeen! Shocker for me. I thought he was gonna do it all again. Whoops.Anywho, the Janitor/suicidal guy should've played a bigger role, don't you think? He was his Norse spirit guide, after all. The acting wasn't that great, but kudos on Zac's bit! I enjoyed it.A bit on the demographic, the children in the theater don't really understand the jokes... seriously. They'll learn, though. Someday, when they finally hit high school. I don't know how many of them understood the douche jokes, or the flexibility bit, and I doubt they know a thing about contraceptives. Much more enjoyable when you're older than twelve, I'd bet. So half the audience started clapping when ""Mark"" and Maggie were about to make out. I almost upchucked. I heard an ""Ew"" when young Mike and Scarlett kissed. There's nothing wrong with kissing your wife. Incest, or (in all technicality) statutory rape? Personally, I'd go with the rape. /Much/ less disgusting.Parents, note the PG-13 rating!

212,thelword987,My honest opinion,9,9 May 2009,"So in my directorial opinion, they hit their cinematic pin on the head. They reached the audience they were trying to. Ned and Jane provided comic relief.- They were great. (Office fans- Jan(Jane) is just as perfectly weird in this- She actually plays the almost the same character- cold and standoffish at first.... then.... Nuts) They stayed away from it being too heavy. Story line had the potential to get too sappy, but most of the time they did a good job of avoiding that. There was just the right amount of awkwardness and tension between Mike and the family. Some definite cringe moments, just as you would expect in this situation. Sets and lighting were strong. Oh, and Zac.... Was PERFECTION!! Sorry, had to have a teenage girl moment. I know the story line isn't believable. But, did you expect it to be? Really!! He falls into a freaking spirit guide's whirlpool. If you walked into the film expecting a realistic story-- - well, you are an idiot. But if you walked in hoping to feel a little younger, then maybe you weren't disappointed. Take it for what it is- a feel good comedy.

Moving on, although this storyline/plot has been seen a couple of times, the essence of Matthew Perry, and Zac Efron helps to make this a truly amazing film. The movie doesn't have such an amazing start, with Zac Efron/Mike O'Donnell is shown to be shooting hoops before a basketball match. He later meets his girlfriend who he discovers is pregnant. This would be the sole reason this movie would not receive a 10, as it kind of throws the audience in, with no build up to the event However, the movie then drastically improves with Zac Efron pulling off an amazing performance, as a 37 year old,trapped in a 17 year old's body which we should all appreciate; is not an easy task. Moving on the move has some funny highlights with O' Donnells daughter falling for his younger self. Its amusing to watch Efron running around the room trying to avoid her.

Zac Efrom was such a good actor in this movie and he's finally stepping out from High School Musical and showing the world his diversity in the industry. My favorite part was the divorce court room part because it shows how much he loves Scarlett. I also like the part when in the beginning he gives up his whole future for the girl he loves and then at the end, he does it again. The only bad part that i actually is that when Matthew perry tells his wife he loves her, its not thee same when zac efron does it. i don't know, maybe it's because zac efron is hot. it weird in health class, when the daughter tries to kiss her dad, and when mike/mark (young) kisses his wife. Ned is mad hilarious but some of the movie is inappropirate for young kids (health class, the cafeteria when mark/mike disses Stan, and some more) but overall the movie was AMAZING. i give it an 11 out of a 10. its my new favorite movie[:",17 Again
220,caseyluvsmadonna-1,Zac Efron And Margaret Cho ... A Gay Dream,10,18 April 2009,Okay I am sick of people saying that this is just the same movie that had been done over and over because it's NOT! I will admit I love Zac Efron ... I'm a gay man ... we all do! Speaking of gay ... this movie had huge gay appeal ... Zac Efron and Margaret Cho (she makes an appearance as a teacher). You get to see Zac shirtless in the beginning and his body is so perfect it looks fake. Zac can definitely carry a movie by himself. This is not a kids movie ... so don't bring your five year olds to the movie ... take them to Hannah Montana. If you are a girl or a gay man ... GO SEE THIS MOVIE!

221,robchu,I was surprised,8,24 April 2009,"This was one of those spur of the moments kind of thing. I took the wife to watch a movie with time not on our side; so we basically purchased two tickets to the first movie the associate provided us. We were late but we only missed the opening previews of new movies. So in a nutshell, our intentions was not to watch this movie but rather watch a movie with no expectations and of course we didn't even know who Zac Efron was nor who was in the movie. Yes we live in a cave...=o) Back to the movie, it was a movie that you will laugh and you may cry but it's definitely a movie that will entertain you with goofs and reality.It was nice to see this at the theatre but it's a rental for sure.",17 Again

I watched all, with the silly hope that it will become better at some point, yet my hope was in vain. If you like the main character, then this movie is good for you, if you don't then do not go to this movie. The story is lame and seen at least a billion of times. The characters are even worse (if its possible). I could say that it is one of the worse movies that I have seen in this year, but that would be too much. I could thou say that everything rides on the main character fame (sorry I could not spell out his name) and everything else is left out. I will give them 2 for trying. The good part that acting was not that bad, but the script...",17 Again
223,sachiitis,"It made me smile, it made me laugh, it made me cry..",10,15 July 2009,"First when I saw the title of this movie, I wasn't expecting it to be exciting, interesting, funny, sweet or even fine. But it was. Really. This movie is full of emotions, as it is said in the headlines, it made me smile, it made me laugh, it made me cry. As well it made me believe in long-lasting marriage. And love. But of course, not everything in this movie was great and successfully made, for example, humor not always made me laugh and in some scenes it was predictable what will happen next, actually, sometimes it also was kind of boring. In my opinion, this movie is more for girls than boys. For those girls who believe in love and that kind of stuff. And yes, I think that this move definitely deserves 10 out of 10! Enjoy it!",17 Again
224,hitech-mils,17 AGAIN is good for the teenagers who don't care 'bout sex,8,16 October 2009,"this movie's 'bout a man who has done lots of bad jobs in the past 'n' now he's absolutely regretful. he wishes to go back... now he's 17, but at the same age (meaning he the time has not gone past). he tries to do his best to help his family and friends to go the right way. I'm a very technological person and am gonna be someone very rich 'n' up to date like Thomas Lennon.the star of the film finally finds his way and comes back to his real life with the best path. and finally he swears to his wife to make the rest of their common life Better & best! the movie says that: we teenagers should start from NOW to prevention from passions. we TEENAGERS MUST BE PROSPECTIVE.-by: Mils Ebay",17 Again
225,shannondaly1,Good...but not great.,7,18 July 2010,"Let's just say I like Zach Efron. I'm not a hater; I'm not giving this an unfair review because I hate anyone is this movie. It was a comedy but I didn't find myself laughing very much, I'm afraid. I only laughed when 1: When Mike is talking to Maggie and she's pretending to listen to her iPod and 2: when Maggie is trying to seduce Mike (as a teenager) and he tells her no and she is saying how it all makes sense why Mike won't go out with her and Zach Efron says, ""No, I'm not gay!"" I just thought it was funny that Zach was talking about his sexuality. LOL. Apart from that, it was slightly boring, the ending was predictable, the acting was nowhere NEAR as good as it could have been and Scarlett O'Donnell was the most ANNOYING person I've ever seen or heard in my life! Worth a watch, but don't waste your time buying a DVD or anything.",17 Again
226,tbay15,Loved this movie,8,4 November 2015,"I loved this movie, it reminded me of ""Vice Versa"", ""16 Again"", etc... I love movies with a magical quality to them. This movie has Zac Efron and Matthew Perry, a perfect combination. It has a family quality to the movie. I love how Zac Efron playing the younger Mike is sweet but tries to keep his daughter from making a big mistake. I also like how they play the angle with the mother/wife without being grossed out. It teaches us that sometimes what we think we might would like to change, it's always more correct if given the opportunity to change. My favorite part is when he tries to romance the wife/mother, but she thinks it's her daughter friend. Also, the best friend is a funny in this movie, he takes it to an extreme with some of his hi-jinx. I would recommend this movie.",17 Again

228,matlenin,Has Hollywood ran out of good ideas?,1,16 April 2009,"I truly have become more convinced that Hollywood has been bankrupt of good ideas or good filmmakers who are in touch with what the audience really want to see. Boring, unimaginative, and completely lacking of good film-making. This film clearly show a complete lack of passion and vision. It imitates what others have so brilliantly forged but still falls flat. Burr Steers? Can someone say the emperor has no clothes? I would have loved to have been sitting in that studio/executive's office during the pitch for this concept. Why were they not thrown out on their behind, I will never know. What do they expect when they start with a very lame script, and then hire a completely inadequate director, Burr Steers, who does not know the craft if it were fed to him with a silver spoon. But wait, I think that is exactly how he got his job...not his skill but his inner connections. The agent for Zac should be fired for choosing such a vehicle to launch his rise into a leading man. Burr steers should never go near comedy again or even near film-making in general.",17 Again
229,alil2sarcastic,Great!,10,18 April 2009,"I have to say it is so disappointing to see people who have rated this movie and haven't even seen it. They clearly just wanted to give it a bad review because a ""tween"" idol is in it.That said. I have to say that this is seriously the funniest movie I've seen all year. Zac isn't playing a 17 year old. He's playing a father in the 17 year old's body and he does a surprising remarkable job at it. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Mann is phenomenal. The humor is spot on for tweens, adults, and everything in between.While it's no Oscar contender or anything like that, it will keep you entertained for a solid two hours without you even realizing that time has passed.Give it a chance. You won't be disappointed!",17 Again
230,ilmanramadhanu,it was pretty funny and could make me laugh..,7,2 July 2012,"this movie was pretty funny. and the idea was also very creative. but it feels weird i mean how can someone who falls into the water. and then turns back into a 17yo kid. however i have to admit that Zac Efron did a great job in playing the character mike o'Donnell. and also Thomas Lennon, he was really funny in this movie and played as 'ned'. drama in the movie was very unique. and the drama begins when the young Mike begin to close with Scarlett. i think the drama was unique because mike,17yo kid approached a woman who has two teenage children. although mike was actually the husband of Scarlett but it still weird wasn't it. but but but the movie was still great and awesome.",17 Again
231,crashvictim,Really surprisingly good!,9,10 April 2009,"I went into this a little dubious, unable to get tickets for anything else but set on seeing something - I walked out glad nothing was available! First off, the casting is brilliant with the teenage and adult versions of each of the main 3 characters. Secondly, it proves that Zac Efron really can act, not just sing, dance and play basketball (although they do flaunt the latter two talents of these within the first 10 minutes). Finally, it's original. Although reminding me, and probably everyone who's reading this, of films like Freaky Friday, 13 Going On 30, Big, etc, just being the opposite way in age, it really makes good use of the comedy this situation brings, but doesn't rely on it or overplay on it.Basically, as long as you're not an Efron-hater, you should walk out of this film not feeling at all ashamed that you'd just watched a film with over 100 ten to fourteen year old girls!",17 Again
232,manidina,Great Movie,9,27 June 2014,"The storyline and majority of this movie was great and appropriate for both adults and children, even families, taking into consideration the few sexual references and scenes that trailed within the film. Overall, the high school theme was greatly portrayed, bringing both the late 80's generation and current 21st century in a smart and effective combination, in a manner that can bring a variety of audiences together to appreciate this movie and what it has to bring in countless ways. How past and present collide, along with the key aspects of family values and the responsibility that comes with being a father or a mother, this symbolism is shown greatly through the perspective of the father. The only down-fall i could really pickup on was the character chosen to play the older and present version of Mike O'Donnell, who i believe has no similar characteristics that provide any resemblance to Zac Efron (the younger version and on the most part, main character) or the either way around in Zac's case. But apart from that, his best friend was absolutely hilarious, and the conclusion to the film was very touching and brought out my emotions. This may be a comedy, but heybring tissues if your a sucker for a corny yet oddly unpredictable ending. Never underestimate the power of just an ordinary high school setting, as ironic and cliché it may sound, I guess that's the beauty of moviesthey just capture you within the moment. I know for fact this movie did exactly that for me, I hope it does for you.",17 Again
233,becci2702,Awesome performance from Zac Efron,9,12 April 2009,"At first glance this appears to be a film that will primarily attract fans of High School Musical, i.e. the most part teenage or young girls, but don't get me wrong as they will make up a large proportion of the fans of this movie, but I feel this film has a lot more to offer. It may possess a somewhat predictable storyline that we have seen a couple of times before, but if you are looking for a lighthearted film to keep you entertained throughout, this will do the job. Zac Efron shows us he is more than the ""all-singing-all-dancing"" charmer from High School Musical, he nails this performance. His character is believable throughout showing audiences he is a true actor, not a franchise and will hopefully lose some of the stigma he attracted in the role of Troy Bolton. Co-stars also but in a good performance including Matthew Perry although not getting much air time still played a valid role in the film as an entirety. Great watch for all the family, I definitely recommend this one!",17 Again
