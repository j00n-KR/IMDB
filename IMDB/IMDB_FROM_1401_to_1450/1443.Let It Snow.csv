0,TheLittleSongbird,Not enough of a cheertastic miracle,5,21 April 2020,"Am going to start this review with a confession. This is one of not many book to film adaptations where the film has been seen but the book hasn't been read yet. Am planning to do so now, with so much love for it here and whether it is better than the film, which is the general consensus here. This is going to come from someone judging 'Let It Snow' on its own terms, being a fan of Christmas and who liked the premise even with the slightly corny title.'Let It Snow' was one of those films that left me rather conflicted. It does have too many flaws to warrant the highest possible rating, but to me it had enough merits to give it a 3 at least. Can see both sides of view here, can see 'Let It Snow's' appeal for some but can also see why others would dislike it outside of comparing it unfavourably to the source material. Even if the book had been read, it would still have been rated on its own terms by me which has always to me being a fairer way to judge.There are good things here in 'Let It Snow'. It looks lovely, especially the photography which at its best gorgeous if never revolutionary. Making the most of the picturesque scenery that does give an authentic Christmassy feel. The music is a pleasant listen and fits nicely, there are festive films that have music that is too constant and overbears everything but thankfully not here. The songs are great. There are amusing moments and also some very sweet ones, with some of the situations being true to life.Did also find the acting good considering the cliched material they had to work with. The actors play with a good deal of charm and charisma, with the odd spark in comic timing. Shameik Moore does more than credibly and it was great to see Joan Cusack again despite her strange role, have not seen enough of her recently. There is definitely chemistry here.For all those good things, 'Let It Snow' does have its misgivings. It is not a case of the film not trying. If anything, it tries too hard. Evident in having too many subplots and too many characters in too short a length. Nearly all being underdeveloped to blandness and having lots of cheese and schmaltz that can be hard to bear at times. The characters are too sketchy to make one want to care for them, and Julie can be difficult to warm to, relationships also feel rushed.All the subplots have good moments, but can feel forced and very cliche ridden throughout, and while the structure of the film is interesting and different for a Christmas film it feels disjointed with less than smooth transitioning and doesn't quite come together.In summary, mixed feelings here. 5/10",Let It Snow
1,phd_travel,Uninteresting characters,4,11 November 2019,Disappointing Christmas movie mixed with teen romance. A bunch of uninteresting characters that aren't appealing. Being a fan of Kiernan and Odeya I watched this but couldn't find any of the stories involving. The pop singer thing seemed very fake. The lesbian affair wasn't convincing. Kiernan's story about her good friend and secret of love was so cliched.Skip this one.,Let It Snow
2,ops-52535,i might as well admit it,6,8 November 2019,"Im to old and grumpy for these kinda heyo teenage get together in a speedy happy cristmas and let the merry go around the steamboat charlie cause were gonna have a party at the waffle bar in the afful city - movie kinda thing.....see.....i'm far tooo oldwell, its a sweet film by all means, and it has a serious background noise all the way through , that really stabs the humour dead. but the moral is there so its cute in many ways, so were the actors too, but they had what seems to me a bit lack of spontanity in their acting. to be very negative there are a case of slow pacing inflicting bad wibes to this flick too, but never the less, it works.as a filmographic product, its nice, though an x-mas movie should have had some more star spangling x-mas lightening decorating the backgrounds and the editing couldve been a bit more prescise that said, do enter this film for its choice of music, i guess some 20 different season related songs were stuffed into this flick and that was awesome...the still grumpy old man that never have been on a drink drank drunk x-mas eve party,,we use to beat the bush on boxing day, will nevertheless give a recommend.",Let It Snow
3,cruise01,"Entertaining, fun, and predictable.",6,11 November 2019,"Let it Snow (3 out of 5 stars).Let it Snow is a comedy romantic film about a group of young teens in small town during Christmas Eve. With several characters intertwining with each other, some fall in love, some are trying to express their emotions with their friends, some coming across a break up, and others are trying to host a party.The plot is simple. It is a Christmas movie version of Valentine's Day or New Years Eve. But with young adults. Julie (Isabela Merced) got accepted into a university but she is afraid to leave home cause her mom is sick. But she runs into a singer Stuart (Shameik Moore) who just wants to be himself without the publicity getting a hold of him. Addie (Odeya Rush) her boyfriend has been ignoring her all Christmas Eve which she is trying to rush out to meet him and his friends. Dorrie (Liv Hewson) is having trouble trying to express her emotions towards another girl while she is working at a Waffle House. Angie (Kiernan Shipka) and Tobin (Mitchell Hope) been friends for a long time but he is having difficulties to tell her how he feels about her. While they go on a run after they stolen beer keg from a group of other teens. Keon (Jacob Batalon) is trying to get a party together at the waffle house.The plot is predictable. But it is funny, it has its charms and cringy moments with awkwardness. It is entertaining.The cast ensemble all did well with their characters. Making their performances shine with their fun personality. It is a fun love story but cannot be surprised that we have all seen were every romantic comedy goes in the end.Overall, Let it Snow is a fair film. It is predictable. It is fun and entertaining. But it is nothing special that is worth watching again.",Let It Snow

8,peterp-450-298716,Help! I watched a real corny chick-flick. Is there still hope for me?,4,19 November 2019,"Snow can make a difference!
Especially on Christmas Eve.
And sometimes it's not just the eve of Christmas,
it's the eve of everything,
of the rest of your life.Christmas. The period everyone is jolly again. Family reunions. A brown-baked turkey with a tasty filling that was squeezed through its smallest hole. Christmas trees full of sparkling baubles, angel hair and soft-yellow LED lights. Every few moments a Christmas song is being heard on the radio. Christmas presents are piling up. And everyone hopes that on this Christian holiday the sky will be filled with pregnant snow clouds that'll cover the surface of the earth with a soft, downy snow carpet. Sigh, I'm getting lyrical. Unfortunately, this isn't the case everywhere. If you have a moderate maritime climate, such as in Belgium, it'll be drizzly and autumnal. And an additional phenomenon during these holidays is the broadcasting of well-known Christmas movies. And yes, on Twitter the annually recurring question ""What's the ultimate Christmas film?"", appears again. Unfortunately, ""Let it snow"" won't be mentioned often, I guess.If, like me, you dislike ""Love actually"", I would definitely advise you to avoid this youthly version. ""Love actually"" is a typical film that is shown on different television channels during the Christmas season. Perhaps the film adds that extra magic for some of us, during these winter holidays. For me, it causes an extreme form of explosive diarrhea every time I see the grin of Hugh Grant on the screen. And ""Let it snow"" uses the same concept as ""Love actually"". An entanglement of different storylines that come together in an ecstatic crescendo. Only now, the protagonists are all teenagers. Each with their own love-life-related-issues. Understandable because the film is based on the eponymous popular winter book, in which three authors bring a short story.Unfortunately, after a few minutes, I realized that I'm not really part of the target audience. Not that I was bored to death. The stories eventually follow the pattern of a trillion other rom-com stories. They all walk the famous proverbial path of love, full of pitfalls, stumbling blocks, and obstacles. And at the finish, everything is peaches and cream. And peace and light. The feeling of love rises by a few degrees Celsius. In short, it's as predictable as a story from Vicky the Viking. An ultimate feel-good film so teenage girls will sigh and moan empathetically while they watch at the screen with big cow eyes and see those romantic couples hugging each other. Well, my teenage period is far behind me. Hence the ""Not being part of the target audience"" feeling.The most positive in this film are the participating actors. I didn't know them all, because I'm not a fan of the Netflix series. Only Julie (Isabela Merced) I recognized immediately (Yes, I recently watched ""Dora and the Lost City of Gold"" with my two kids). She happens to have the most beautiful and convincing role. The way in which she presents responsible Julie is admirable. It's the most endearing and sad part of the entire film. I even appreciated the pop idol Stuart (Shameik Moore). He fits wonderfully with the lovely, cuddly Julie. He's a lonely, fame-ridden singer who spends Christmas all alone in a hotel room. Ultra sad. Even though he will wallow in all the luxury that he can afford. I also thought the role of Tobin (For me, the unknown Mitchell Hope) was successful. But only because of his humor and timid attitude that fitted perfectly in this syrupy film. And here too, they found the perfect companion in the form of The Duke (Kiernan ""The Silence"" Shipka). The funniest character was that of Jacob ""Spider-man: Homecoming & Far from home"" Batalon as the hyperkinetic Keon.Add a lesbian girl with love troubles and her girlfriend who doesn't have her best day, and you have all the cliché types that a movie like ""Let it snow"" needs. After that, let everyone wrestle the whole movie with his or her emotions and finally knit a happy ending to it. It's not my taste, but who am I to complain about that. After all, it's a Christmas movie. And shouldn't a Christmas film be about happiness and love? Even though the corniness drips from it and it is so sugar-sweet that a spontaneous stomach cramp comes up. I want romantic souls to have it. So couples of this earth, unite and go and watch this film en masse. Oh well, next Movie!More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Let It Snow
9,aidanratesmovies,"Uninspired adaptation has many flaws, but proves to be entertaining",6,8 November 2019,"Although the film looks beautiful and has an admittedly delightful tone, Let It Snow unfortunately squanders its source material for a bland and poorly written script. The film at times does prove to be entertaining, with a tone that, even despite its flaws, seems irresistible. However, the film seems to fall flat on itself and its potential to be something bigger than an average holiday adaptation for the season. Plainly, it feels rushes, uninspired, and at times simply corny. The acting in the film varied from quite horrible to simply okay. No real standouts in general, although some actor's do give it their best shot to make their characters at least somewhat interesting. The film's pacing does seem to fit, but the story dragged along with it seems like an unfit match. In the end, Let It Snow may prove to be enjoyable to look at, but hardly so to watch, and definitely not to comprehend.
My Rating: 5.75/10",Let It Snow
10,saadgkhan,Feel good movie of the year,7,8 November 2019,"Let it Snow - B+ (Memorable)Light hearted, used its source material to its full potential with young ensemble cast. In todays times, conveying message about acceptance, self love and respect without coming across as preachy is becoming hard in movies and books. The cinema and books can only work if they portray something human regardless of good or bad in most inhuman or unreal situations like weather in this movie.Go watch it, and Let it Snow : )",Let It Snow

12,thekarmicnomad,A lovely formulaic thing of Christmas,7,14 December 2020,"A load of diverse, beautiful, young people navigate their love lives on the run up to Christmas.Now, first off nobody was reaching for an Oscar here, that just wasn't in anyone's remit.
This is a chance to escape to a snow covered America where everyone is beautiful, well mannered, articulate and two heartbeats away from falling desperately in love.
To look at this film beyond that does it a disservice.The plot is as predictable as you can imagine and so sweet I'd recommend a diabetes check after watching - but that's fine - it is the season not to be miserable.
The characters are likable and just deep enough to be interesting.
Production is fine, as is acting and camera work - it has that slick feel of a well rehearsed team that knows exactly what they are doing when it comes to pooping out made for T.V Christmas movies.I watched this with my girlfriend whilst we wrapped presents and it drew us in enough to put scissor and sticky tape down - which is perfect.If you take this at face value and allow yourself to get absorbed into a world where the biggest worries are finding booze for a party or getting a girl to notice you , then you will have a pleasant time.",Let It Snow

These types of movies have been done so often you truly realize no one has an original thought anymore. All of these themes have been explored in other much better films. I am convinced that the 80's had the best movies. Everything after those are just copycats or wannabes.

I never read the book so I can't compare which is better. But the movie is a decent watch for performances and feel good moments. Isabella Merced, Odeya Rush, Kiernan Shipka, Jacob Batalon, Mitchell Hope, Liv Hewson and Joan Cusack did a good job. I think Shameik Moore could have done a better job.

18,pensacolacomputer,Just like any other Netflix movie,2,19 December 2020,Actors are now hired because of the way they look... instead of their talent...I miss the good ole days which is why I am now watching older movies...instead Netflix and other studios have to make EVERY MOVIE look and feel the same....I'm all for inclusion but its getting old fast,Let It Snow
19,nethy-nho,where is the snow?,7,16 November 2019,"Like I read the book that inspired the movie,I think that I must compare them. Let's start, well, on the book, we have three tales that through of plot will have more connections with the every characters, and all the tales emphasize a lot about the snowstorn, and we have more misadventures into that. but at the movie we have less about that, less about the characters, and less about the places and some stories that could be able to be better than that we have here, some differences, i loved, all the tales are into an only narrative , the highlight about the Aluminum-woman, and Dorrie be a lesbian, but some differences take off the originality that the book has, and some times get too cliche, but still a great story to see at Christmas, have a soundtrack pretty good and amazing cast.",Let It Snow
20,snowfre,An easily digested movie that points out Netflix's major issue,5,18 November 2019,"I kicked off the holiday season with Netflix's latest Christmas flick ""Let It Snow""; a movie that brings you the right Christmas feels with the formula of the British ""Love Actually"". ""Let It Snow"" follows various people, all of which struggling with their love life (except for one aspiring DJ) and their individual stories are intertwined towards the end of the movie as a party is thrown at the Waffle House. The initial reaction after watching this film was ""meh"". There are no unexpected plot elements and not even the always wonderful Joan Cusack - appearing in a tinfoil garb - gives the film any form of originality. This is also how ""Let It Snow"", in a line of other movies and shows, manages to pin point and an ever increasing problem with Netflix: namely the lack of Originals that are anything else than crowd pleasing conventional productions. As the steaming war expands, Netflix keeps pumping out, mainly, films that hardly ever surprises you - negatively or positively. Watching many of the Netflix Original is not a very brain challenging activity and ""Let It Snow"" qualifies as one of those uninspiring movies. That being said, I'm one of those who can still feel entertained and this particular films gives you the bare minimum of Christmas spirit and that is after all one of the goals for a movie such as this.",Let It Snow

Like Isabella Merced who plays Dora in ""Dora and the Lost City"", or Mitchell Hope who plays Ben in ""Descendants"", or Kiernan Shipka who plays Sabrina in ""Chilling adventures of Sabrina"", or Jacob Batalon who plays Ned Leeds in ""Spider-Man: Far From Home""and Liv Hewson who plays Abby Hammond in""Santa Clarita Diet"" I don't know how many teens have watched that show but they are big stars for teens for Netflix.That is the exclusive thing ""Let it snow"" has to offer.

Nothing amazing but a solid yet fun and entertaining film which I did enjoy watching despite its flaws.
In terms of story, it is rather ""seen that before"" kind of film plagued with clichés from start to finish but i did really like it still.. I wouldn't saying anything is original or unique but it at least tries to be a good film and it does work. It's a nice and sweet film and that's thanks to semi decent writing and somewhat likable characters.
The chacraters weren't anything special but they were all likeable and interesting enough to continue watching. Performance wise, I thought everyone was really decent. Kiernan Shipka was the most talented of the bunch.Overall I think its probably one of the better John Green adaptations we've had. Not as good as Looking for Alaska though.

A sweet movie and not badly acted at all.
My issue with these movies is that you latch on to ones of the stories and want more of that, a few of the stories are okay and there's always one that just doesn't do it for you. This is no exception, I loved the Dories story and yet never got the lady in the silver paper.

Each story was lovely on their own, providing a nice fun package.According to the way I rate movies:This receives 1/2 stars for story, 2/2 stars for giving the viewers what we expected from its synopsis. The direction, cinematography and soundtrack together gets 1/2 stars. I personally give it 2/2 stars because I really enjoyed it.

He has charisma, comedic timing and in the end his sincerity for the girl he loves was sent true by him.Pity the movie did not do as well as he did in it.

37,Kareneo,Really good!,9,8 December 2019,"In the early stages, it is beautifully written with layers of subtlety I haven't seen in an American film in years. I was often amazed and moved. As I said, early on, there were some incredible heartfelt moments. The only downside is that when bringing all the threads together to construct the ending, the writers/director went down a bit of a 'twee' path, that in part marred their earlier good work. If they had been able to maintain their great and subtle beginning, this film would have been a 10/10. I still highly recommend it as a feel-good Christmassy movie for the family.",Let It Snow
38,pierreolivier-21287,Snow can make a difference? Really?,4,11 November 2019,"Take the plot, put it any seasons, same thing.
There is basically no connexion between what is told and what is shown: how snow can change the day. Maybe for the sledge ride.You can remove the snow, twist a little here and there, and the movie loses the little substance it has...
I can watch movies when I don't want to think and just want to relax, but this felt like a waste of time.
Certainly, the shots look nice... But what are they without a story?
Really hard to find a red line, if there is any, connecting the plots...
I was not expecting much from a Netflix exclusive movie... Usually not much to expect on the movie side (TV Shows exclusives are amazing, don't get me wrong, just not their movies).

39,elizabeth-12994,#theytried,2,22 November 2019,"It tried to be love actually, but was it...............take a wild guess............no.....The acting, in some cases wasn't bad from everyone and the film picture wasn't bad by any means, but the story line really did attempt to copy that of Love Actually, which is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed and I'm not really one for rom coms (Rubbish Old Manky Cringey Overated Movies).I just thought the story lines and character development were in no way good. At times, you could sometimes feel a glimpse of sympathy, but not really. I liked how they incorporated LGBTQ+ into it, expect for the fact they messed up that story line too, but please don't get me started on that.The tin foil lady thing.....didn't really........make sense. It was like an attempt at comedy but.......it didn't work.I thought this could have had the potential to be a good film, if, on personal opinion, it wasn't rushed as the plot could have been okay, but they didn't take much time with developing those plots and the script writing wasn't great.Comedy is a hit or miss, which I do understand. It can be incredibly hard to hit it right with comedy, but I'm afraid it didn't really make me laugh.It might be just me, but I didn't overalls enjoy this movie.",Let It Snow

Sunday morning sitting in pyjamas type movie. Someone said it was so politically correct it ruined it. Not true. It was current. Acting was pretty good. Some up coming stars worth a watch.

64,jeffrsprague,Liked it waaay more than I expected to.,8,6 December 2019,"We just watched this movie on Netflix and I enjoyed it way more than I expected to - but I have no idea who to recommend it to.It's meant for a younger generation than mine, but most younger folks are going to see the description of ""Let it Snow"" and think it's a dumb Hallmark Christmas movie for old people. Older people are going to start watching it, thinking it's a delightful new Hallmark Christmas movie, then throw down their plate of chicken-fried-steak in disgust and yell at their TV ""I'm not watching this junk, what's the matter with kids today?!"" and switch over to Wheel of Fortune.As a youth leader at church, I can't directly recommend it to sensitive church friends or impressionable young folks because the movie has some (light) teenage drinking and a bit of profanity and a constant modern music score (which is neither good nor bad, just unexpected in a ""Christmas"" movie) and one of story threads is (light) LGBT. (There is no sex or violence or anything scary, and there is a lot of good, uplifting humanity in it as well.)Yes, it features a lot of angsty, dramatic teens in a whole lot of angsty, dramatic, (and stereotypical) situations, but at the end of the day, it was both familiar AND fresh. I thought it was REMARKABLY well written, acted, and authentic.Although primarily a drama (I guess), it had a lot of humor and managed to do what few movies can pull off - it made me laugh (or at least softly snicker in delight) and I didn't have to be embarrassed by any of the things that made me chuckle.It currently has a mediocre 5.8 on IMDB, but I can't help but wonder if that was mostly from old farts expecting a Hallmark movie.

Therefore, my expectations were zero. Actually, Sub-Zero. That way, anything better than that is gravy. The script was definitely not academy award material. As expected. The acting was sophomoric, at best. But it was clean, decent and free of non-stop profanity and gratuitous, pointless sex.

Just deep-in-your-stomach ungratifying discomfort. If you're into that sort of thing, enjoy this film.To be fair, I've never reviewed anything before, but this was a painful thing to watch. Harsh, awkward, non sequitur character development. A perpetual trope of ""Look at this character and their thrown-in-your-face quirk that makes them down to earth and relatable"" that does not add to the plot or your actual understanding of the character, which is used to somehow counterbalance the complete lack of story telling throughout. Also, the lack of chemistry between ALL characters was impossible not to notice. Relationships developed unevenly, unexpectedly, and unnaturally. I think the characters chemistry can best be described as the best relationship of anyone in the film was between JP and the pig.",Let It Snow

It's one of those movies that I think younger people would enjoy however from an average movie goer perspective the film felt like it lacked cohesion. The scenes seemed really patched together and the characters don't seem to have depth. It felt like watching a dream where you don't know really what's going on and it just keeps going. It did remind me of Love Actually because of the multiple character arcs but lacked nuance for an emotional connective journey. For me it's a forgetable movie experience. But it can be one of those films you play just to have something playing during a family gathering and there are teenagers in the room. I appreciate the diversity in casting. If people have issue with it I think it speaks more about them than the actual film.,Let It Snow

The different plotlines are very predictable but you still find yourself rooting for the main characters. Overall a feelgood movie but don't go into it expecting something new that you haven't seen before.

No household names, but actors you might recognise; the funny, fat kid off the new Spider-Man films, the new Sabrina, and a wacky cameo from Joan Cusack.It's a bit of a poor man's Breakfast Club, so it can't help having a very 'British' soundtrack (steer clear if you don't like 'The Whole of the Moon'), but it has some quirky, sassy characters and snappy dialogue.Christmas Cheese Rating: 5/10. It's low on lactose for a Christmas movie, but it's got a lot of festive imagery woven through the story.Snow Rating: 10/10. Every. Single. Scene.Actually Any Good Rating: 7/10.

There's something about christmas movies that makes you forget that they're a complete cliché as you get into the spirit. But this is not the case.
This looks like a mix of every teenage cliché -- the best friend in love, the girl who doesn't like a superstar and then hooks up with him, and even a new kind of cliché that is an LGBT romance of an outkast with a popular in-the-closet person, I will make an excuse for the last one since we don't get to see many lesbian christmas movies.
The stories don't necessarily fit together, they could have been shown in a minisseries and it would flow better. If the idea is to reproduce the early 2010's romantic comedies with multiple mature couples in Christmas and New Year's Eve (like the 2011 film), then it works.

I didn't really mind the typical teenager cliche stuff. It's all about execution...Like the snow, this film just seemed to drift a bit too much. The characters and their narratives become reasonably engaging before we're suddenly then on to something else and you don't really know why.A Love Actually with teenagers is a good way of putting it, but what makes LA a classic is the way it all blends together so well. We have a strong unifying theme running through LA: the romance surrounding the buzz of the festive season and the feeling that it's all building somewhere (as the festive season naturally does), plus the satisfying way it all ties together in the end. Let It Snow is maybe more a sign of the times in that the characters are more self absorbed and disconnected... It's like it needed a unifying goal to the whole thing, which was kind of there but just didn't come out. Christmas often seemed somewhat incidental in that the characters were more caught up in their personal dramas to be able to relate to the bigger picture of the festive season. An example: by the time the girl who meets the pop singer gets back home I'd COMPLETELY forgotten she'd initially set out to get a specific Christmas present for her mother. Why did that goal get so buried? With a title like Let It Snow, it seems it wants to be considered a Christmas film, right? Was it though? I don't know.I think this sense of drift had a lot to do with pacing - some characters go on a string of incidents: going on a car chase, skidding off the road, running off to a church etc etc... and meanwhile you have a bunch of other characters who, all the while, are at the Waffle House eating waffles. This kind of thing just pegs the film back.Buuuut, ya know, overall it's okay. The cast do a good job, it's filmed well, the setting is decent. Like I say, the ingredients were there. Maybe a case of too many cooks spoilt the eggnog.",Let It Snow

That should be part of the expectation going into these movies. When starting this, I knew what I was getting into and they delivered on that formula.There are a lot of comments about forced diversity. I would say it's nice to see another depiction of people of multiple ethnicities and sexual orientations carrying out their storylines together. While not the case for everyone, there are many of us who appreciate having an on-screen dynamic that better reflects our real life diverse families and friends.",Let It Snow

119,jessiecburke,"fantastic movie, not even anywhere close to as bad as some say it is.",10,11 June 2020,"First off, if you're expecting to watch the events that happened in the book happen in the movie, then you will be sorely disappointed. as a lover of the book and the movie, you have to think of them as two separate entities, or else one or both will disappoint you. this movie is truly spectacular. it features a diverse cast that actually looks like the people that you may see in a high school (other than their age). modern high schools are very diverse, and this movie represents that beautifully. it shows all the great feels of a rom com, while not being completely white washed and representing the cultures shown in modern day high school. second, there is an lgbt couple. with most rom coms featuring lgbt couples, the story is often completely centered on them and their coming out story, or they are just minor characters in the background. this movie treats the lgbt couple with the same amount of screen time and plot as the other straight couples, which is very important. their relationship is shown as just as important as either of the other couples. it's also not completely centered about coming out, but also on the actual relationship. coming out is important, but it's not the only thing that happens when you're lgbt. this movie shows the other moments that happen as both a regular couple and being lgbt, that are equally as important as coming out.
i truly believe that this is a spectacular film with all around great acting from all of the ensemble roles, and it presents the most accurate representation of high schoolers that i've seen in a while. we need more movies like this that are actually diverse, and represent lgbt people's storylines just as important as they represent straight people's storylines.",Let It Snow

Pretty much nothing happens the entire time, there's fleeting moments where things might get funny or maybe more dramatic, but each fail spectacularly. A lot of semi-emotional moments: like that girl's mom being sick; the guy being bullied and then chased by these twins (no details about that?); like how he is in love with his best friend... All cliched tropes and not even well done ones... and the famous singer trying to be normal or whatever- what was that story line and why does it exist?Also one menial thing that bothered me- one of the characters (can't even remember the name and I just saw it) says ""I want to spend the rest of my life with you"". You're 12, kid- what are you doing!?Anyway, I'm sorry but this was awful... really wanted it to be good! Decent-ish acting but I wish the writers would have done a better job with the dialogue.

I'll start with the positives... The cast is somewhat good, some funny people and some who reaaaally try to do their best with what they've got.
But leaving aside the fact that all that's happening is incredibly rushed, the lines (and their delivery - either with to little emotion or with unnecessary gesturing) are so basic, nothing feels natural, thus ending just being uncomfortable. The soundtrack is also really average not adding anything extra to the narrative process (well maybe just anger and a heavy feeling of frustration).
So if you are a fan of the book or any of John Green's work in particular and you were planning to watch this my sincere advice is just don't do it.",Let It Snow

1) it's so different from the book!
I've said this already but like, it is so mega different from the book and it just made it a lot worse than the original! legit so many things are different, the relationship between the Duke and Tobin is so different, like there are NO cute moments at all, JP is reinvented ENTIRELY and does not even go on the crazy Carla adventures with them and the JP Tobin friendship is completely and utterly LOST! speaking of Carla they barely talk about Carla! And Teagan, Addie and Dorrie's ENTIRE storyline is just SO OFF!! they just show random scenes of baby pigs but NEVER even talk about it, like it's so different!!! And then like the story with Jubilee is just entirely different and for some reason the guy she gets with is famous? like why? Also The Duke is just a totally unlikable character, her face makes me want to punch her, and is she actually dumb she takes no hints from Tobin. Anyway, point being the story is so different and just so much worse2) No cute moments
Kinda leads in from the first point, there are literally no cute moments in this movie at all. All the cute fun times are just cut out. it's just lame. and boring3)No character development
the movie is just incredibly bland, like the characters are just being overly dramatic about stuff and screaming and crying, and I'm like yo why are you even sad? I'm not even emotionally invested in you? like I'm so confused?So in conclusion. It's different, bland and uninteresting!",Let It Snow

LOL As other reviewers noted, it is a Love Actually for young people, and yes, I love that movie, too. Although I initially added it to My List when I saw Kiernan Shipka was in it (and have been a big fan since watching her grow up on Mad Men, etc.), the casting is spot on for EVERY SINGLE character--so diverse and representative of many walks of life, experiences, hopes, desires. I guess what always gets me are the perfect mix of moments that are sweet, hilarious, honest, & heartfelt--many qualities that don't always happen as often as they should in real life. So many noteworthy scenes of the movie, but I have to slightly spoil things by emphasizing that anyone reading this before watching the movie be on the lookout for a church scene with Tobin, Duke, and JP. OMG! Pure Movie Gold!!!! A favorite song of mine THE WHOLE OF THE MOON by The Waterboys is a recurring number in the film. Watching Tobin & Duke sing and play it on the church organ with JP watching love blossoming between 2 best friends--I could just feel the sparks flying. Soooooo cute and very well done!

154,padillajosi,Basic and Nothing Like the Book,4,4 December 2019,"While this move has the skeletal structure of a unique, cute romcom, it's development of the characters and the stilted dialogue just create a mediocre YA film. We're told traits about the main characters yet don't see them in action. The character development of some are just skipped entirely and we're to just trust that they'll be better people. The actions the characters make are unrealistic as well, creating these bizarre, larger-than-life moments that are supposed to bring the subjects together. Instead, they just distract you from what's going on and it leads to even more bizarre character endings where somehow they all ignore everything that happened in the movie up until then and all fall in love. If you're looking for the movie to adopt ANY of the storylines from the original book, then you'll be disappointed. Any interesting plots were abandoned for more cliché storylines, such as a sick mother and a meandering musician. Seriously, the book is just degraded to a boring, family-friendly movie.

This film clearly started as two movies in the 90s that got dusted off and combined into one. That's the only reason it should have three screenwriters; two to write the originals and one mad scientist to combine them together. Of our two romantic leading couples, only one has chemistry, and that's just brother-sister chemistry. As for the other, I'm pretty sure that the two actors hated each other, because Shameik Moore has charisma, and manages to use it in every scene except the ones where he's talking to Isabela Merced. Otherwise everything else in the movie is amazing, the horrible cinematography, contrived plot points, and conspicuous absence of adults or parents in 95% of a movie where 60% of it takes place in a Great Value (tm) Waffle House ON CHRISTMAS EVE. I was also about 75% sure this movie would end with Joan Cusack's aluminum-coated visage murdering all of our twenty-something ""teens"" in an absolutely amazing third act genre shift, and if that did happen this movie would be utterly fantastic, but instead it is just bewilderingly funny.",Let It Snow

As someone who read the book first and then watched the film, I suggest those who also read the book and planning watching the film, to NOT DO IT. I got frustrated, mad and even madder when I realised that I'm mad because of a film.
I need to compare, because I don't know if people who made the film actually read the book, or if they only read some overview of it. So here we go.
Jubilee is not named Jubilee but Julie. I get that they didn't want to get into the whole deal with ""why is her name Jubilee"" but seriously.
Stuart is not Jewish, but an African American. Like what. WHAT? And he is a famous singer. And he goes to ""Julie's"" house instead her going to his? I'm so confused and frustrated about this plot line. There is also this unnecessary 7-minute scene where they are sledding. There's nothing about sledding in the book.
Also, why weren't the cheerleaders on the train? Is it that hard to put them on the train?
About the second plotline; JP is a college hunk who is trying to get the Duke? Why is he at least not Korean? I don't understand.
Also, Addie has black hair instead of blonde and then pink (is it really hard to get a blonde actress?).
Addie didn't cheat on Jeb. And the most important thing: they didn't get back together at the end. That was the whole point! Everyone being so freakishly happy, because they all got to be with the person they wanted.
There is no mentioning of Tegan who in fact wanted the pig, not Addie and Dorrie.
Dorrie is working in the Waffle House and there is not a single mention of a Starbucks. Guess they didn't want to sponsor them.

159,kiki_4283,Why?,1,2 January 2020,"When I read Let It Snow for the first time, I immediately connected with Stuart and Jubilee. Their characters were very well done, and Stuart's family was really wonderful. The story focused on people's relationships both romantically and between friends and family. So when I started the movie, I was appalled by Netflix's decision to change Stuart from a family-oriented Jewish boy with a broken heart to an ear-pierced pop star staying in a hotel for Christmas. Many reviewers who haven't read the book seem confused by the people calling it forced diversity, so I'll explain it for them. When you have to get rid of a well-written diverse storyline in order to add a weak one, that is when it's forced. When every detail that made you love a character is erased in favor of a one-note stereotype of a pop star without a family of his own, wiping away every ounce of relatability, then that movie becomes no more than a trashy attempt to rewrite Love Actually.In addition to the discrepancies in Stuart and Jubilee's storyline, I was also taken aback by the movies portrayal of Addie and Jeb. Instead of the story of Jeb forgiving Addie for cheating on him because of her insecurities, it became a story of a cellphone-addicted stalker girlfriend chasing after a detached, uncaring boyfriend.As someone who has read the book every Christmas for several years, watching a movie that wiped away the best aspects of the characters I hold so dear is beyond frustrating. I was so excited to hear of the movie's release, but I walked away from it with a bitter taste in my mouth and the need to explain exactly why it shouldn't have been made.",Let It Snow

You think they'd at least have a character that I'd care about even slightly.This was full of overused cliche that were not even executed in a way that is new or good.I sure hope the book this was based on isn't as bad as this movie. At least, this movie was only an hour and a half long. Imagine wasting a week's worth of reading if the novel was as yucky as the film.The screenplay was bad. It's the same issues over and over again with boomers writing the screenplay for a teen movie. They have this innate inability to comprehend how teenagers actually talked to each other in real life. We always get pretentious teenagers that are extremely annoying to watch. This was really badly done.Not even the cinematography or the soundtrack can redeem any of the bad parts of the movie. They were mediocre at best.Netflix has been very brave plastering their name consistently on bad films. Maybe they're doing us a favour so we don't need to waste our hard-earned money seeing them in theatres. Thank you Netflix.The creators should have quit while they were ahead with this one but then no film would exist - although that could have been a better option.At least, everyone was happy at the end. Well, except for me.",Let It Snow

169,cslippy,So surprised at how much I liked this movie,7,4 December 2019,I wasn't sure what to expect when my wife and I decided to watch this as we're not really the demographic it was made for. We ended up really enjoying it! It was reminiscent of the John Hughes films we watched in the 1980s. We both recommend giving it a try.,Let It Snow
170,stinalw,Just a very bad movie not worth watching,1,10 December 2019,Just very very bad. Was bored all the way through because all the characters were so flat.,Let It Snow
171,Jeremy1993,A Surprisingly Great Little Film,8,3 December 2019,"Whilst the stories told within this film are relatively generic they are executed so lovingly and the casting is brilliant. For what it lacks in originality it makes up for in charm alongside the excellent choice of songs for the soundtrack. This film is a surprisingly uplifting and refreshing experience. Especially amongst all of the other below average Netflix films. It is a great adaption from the book just like ""Looking For Alaska"" was.If you've read the book or are looking for an unchallenging experience that will leave you feeling happy and emotional then check this out.",Let It Snow
172,davidstanmore,Loved it,10,13 December 2019,"Just perfect for me. I just let it's modern simplicity roll on, I didn't want it to end. Just loved it.",Let It Snow
173,krista-arndt,Try it. You'll enjoy it.,10,28 December 2019,"Lots of great messages about inclusion, love, and friendship on a day when anything can happen. I detest soppy movies but this was not that. It's a feel good story full of wisdom and warmth.",Let It Snow
174,juliasmovies,Many lifelike moments,7,10 January 2020,"I hesitated to watch this movie due to negative reviews but I'm glad I watched it anyway. Indeed there are a few things that feel a bit forced, like the guy who really wants to have a big party, and some interactions are a little stiff. But I think many interactions between people in life are stiff cause we don't always know how to behave around each other. That being said, there are some magical scenes: the spontaneous and beautiful singing in church while hiding from the 'bad guys', when the celebrity shows that he is a human being, the coming out, the dancing to Rolling stones, and the dancing at the christmas party when everything seems to come together. It is a feelgood movie but it has sad parts too. I think it has many lifelike moments with people being people. There are different stories within a larger story and they come together nicely.",Let It Snow
175,markolapcevic,Really bad,1,3 November 2020,I like the book too much that I can enjoy watching this. Different and stupid storylines completely destroyed the book. I'd like to see another version of this film. Version the follows the book without altering.,Let It Snow
176,lizkasper,Just...not the book. Sigh,3,10 November 2019,"Had I not gone into it with ""A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle"" being my favorite John Green work, I might have enjoyed it more...but I love the original three storylines too much to enjoy the barely-recognizable ones the movie used.",Let It Snow
177,hofreddoxd,"the film is mediocre, but the actors are good",7,8 November 2019,Why is the best scene of this movie (directorially) during the credits? I'm actually not joking: it's a fairly good long take.,Let It Snow
178,vasvisharma,A beautiful romantic feel good movie,8,9 November 2019,"It was very interesting and engaging all the time. Like, there was no time when I felt that it's way too long or slow. I guess it was perfect in everything like the cast and all but yeah, the film could have been better. I loved how they used the same song for Angie and Tobin. That was really great for building the connection with the characters.
It had good comedy and romance which I was expecting from it. So, in that scenario it was up to my expectations and I felt really amazing after watching it and while watching it. This was one of the reason why I really liked it.",Let It Snow
179,doraa46,worst script ever,1,17 December 2019,"Horrible christmas love story with too many heartbreaking-motivational dialogs with bad music, average actors and 3rd grade screenplay",Let It Snow

182,taralaughlin,Total CRAP as my dad used to say,1,3 December 2019,"I can't believe that Netflix puts this out. This movie has nothing to do with the sacred holiday of Christmas. It's rated PG 13, when it should be rated R with parental restrictions. Five minutes in I turned it off because of the sexual content. I'm 55 and no prude, but this is trash and inappropriate. It's not a Christmas movie. I'm glad I grew up when I did watching real Christmas movies with a good message.",Let It Snow
183,matisflip,A great movie for this time of the season,10,16 November 2019,I really did enjoy the movie and was quite sad when it was over :(,Let It Snow
184,ayeebeemagahiz,Not like the book,3,10 November 2019,"Theres different storylines which is fine and what Netflix is known to do. They changed Jubilee to Julie.
The main stories are different compared to the book. I got distracted from the movie a bit but it is a feel good movie where each story interacts with the other.",Let It Snow
185,pthang,The most cringeworthy movie of the year.,1,9 November 2019,"Acting was bad and awkward. But the writing was even worse: full of cliché, unnatural and cheesy conversations. Plot was too predictable, no surprises whatsoever. Every character in this movie was unnecessarily rude all the time.",Let It Snow
186,dieukhechanyeol,CUTEST FILM EVER,10,21 May 2020,"5,8/10? seriously guys? it deserves more, i would give it a 200 out of 10 if i could 😄 WELL, AS I SAID, CUTEST FILM EVER - PERIOD",Let It Snow
187,tinyhell,Wanted to like it,3,5 December 2019,"I really wanted to like this movie since its supposed to be based on my favourite Xmas book but... I can't get through it, they changed too much. My favourite in the book are Stuart and Jubilee and their story is completely changed, everything I liked about it - gone. The good parts of the book aren't there. I'd say it's very loosely based on the book, they could have changed the title and I wouldn't have know that it's based on the book. Nope. Sorry.",Let It Snow
188,keziafaithobbus,Not that worth it?,4,2 January 2020,The pairings were cute and all but the script botched it for me. Scenes didn't transition smoothly and all the cringe from just movie just made me laugh,Let It Snow
189,james_yazawa,Average but cute !,6,6 December 2019,"Though the movie was average, with some jokes that fell flat, and elements that weren't the greatest (especially the character who throws the party, who came off as annoying), the couples were all pretty cute, and I loved the lesbians. Just a cute winter guilty pleasure movie.",Let It Snow
190,andreagibbs-06719,LOVED it!!,10,9 November 2019,"I chucked this on Netflix cause the kids wanted to watch a movie and I thought it looked tolerable enough for me. Well, kids got distracted while I was trying to watch it, they got loud, I got mad, so I sent them outside to play so I could finish it in peace. It was a great feel good movie!",Let It Snow
