0,MartinHafer,An emo-infused super-hero movie that's not as bad as its 5.4 rating would imply--at least until the ending.,5,5 March 2011,"I am not a comic book fan, so I really know little about Daredevil. And, if I was, I might have thought very differently about this film. So, I guess my review is best tailored to non-comic lovin' folks in their mid-40s--probably NOT the demographic the film makers were looking for when they made ""Daredevil"".The film involves a rather unbelievable super-hero (Ben Afleck)--a guy who is blind but the same accident that blinded him also gave him amazing powers--such as echo-location (making a true Bat-man). It makes being blind seem pretty cool. Along the way he meets a sexy girlfriend (Jennifer Garner) and a psycho hit-man (Colin Farrell).I could try explaining the very action-packed plot further, but frankly, with so many other review, I'm not going to bother. Instead lets get to what I liked and didn't like. While completely silly, the plot was engaging and I liked the ridiculous character. But, I frankly thought the baddie (Farrell) was much more interesting and I would have preferred his character getting his own film! Also, this film, at times, got really, really dumb. In particular, the ending was just awful. I mean, you see Daredevil murder people (they have it coming) but when he finally catches up to the man who murdered his father he does nothing....absolutely nothing! Also, the macho fight between Garner and Afleck early in the film was just awful...and really, really lame. Overall, it's a film that is mindless brain candy and nothing more. With a slightly better script, it could have been so much better.",Daredevil
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Very underrated, I also agree that the Director's Cut is infinitely superior to the theatrical release",8,25 January 2012,"I have to admit when I saw Daredevil in its theatrical release, I found myself underwhelmed by it. I loved the visuals, but I found the love story soppy and couldn't always make sense of the story. However, hearing so much about the Director's Cut being superior I got the DVD off my brother, and actually I really liked it. Daredevil is not what I call a perfect movie, I still did find the love story soppy and becoming dangerously close to flagging down the film and the soundtrack is rather dated and heavy for my liking. On the other hand, I loved the stylish visuals, the fresh, funny dialogue, that I could make much more sense of the story and could be more entertained by it and the characterisation of the titular character with him being vulnerable and flawed I found him very interesting. The other characters are not as well developed, but are enthusiastically performed. Colin Farrell especially is lots of fun, Jennifer Garner is decent and Michael Clarke Duncan is great as is Joe Pantoliano. The editing is good if occasionally rushed, and the action sequences are clear if not always very subtle. Overall, a good movie that fared much better on re-watch. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",Daredevil
2,bkoganbing,A Guardian Devil Prowling The Night,6,6 May 2008,"Still another Marvel Comic superhero makes it to the big screen and allows Ben Affleck to wear spandex. In this age of computer graphics, they'll all be on the big screen sooner or later because these films do make money.Which is the reason an actor like Ben Affleck will do them. Also because he can be a kid again. And after Gigli this man needed a hit or two under his belt.Daredevil may be the darkest of all superheroes and not just because he's blind. In a prologue section with Scott Terra playing Affleck as a child we see how he became blind when he was sprayed with toxic waste. And we also see how his father, David Keith, a boxer was killed after he refused to throw a fight and lessen himself in his son's eyes.Affleck's character though blind has all of his other senses more acutely developed, but he's quite vulnerable. He's a street lawyer who takes only the cases for the underdog. And if justice isn't done, he metes it out as daredevil and sometimes that could mean just cold blooded assassination. There are two villains in Daredevil, the 'kingpin of crime' Michael Clarke Duncan a long way from being the gentle giant John Coffey in The Green Mile. And there's Bullshot played by Colin Farrell who looks like he's having one great old time chewing the scenery to bite size bits.Jennifer Garner is in Daredevil as Affleck's love interest who shows she has a few moves of her own. Daredevil isn't great, but not half bad and I'm sure if the money's right Affleck will be back.",Daredevil
3,Leofwine_draca,Criminally underrated,7,2 June 2016,"This surprisingly dark and moody superhero yarn is a great and unexpected surprise – probably the most genuinely entertaining comic-book film to come out of Hollywood in the early surge of such movies. It certainly walks all over the likes of HULK and SPIDER-MAN. The fun aspect of the movie comes from a pleasingly witty script, which serves up crisp dialogue throughout; some surprising plot developments (coming from somebody who never reads any comics); memorable acting performances and a freshness which is more than worthwhile. The backstory of the main character is run through pleasingly fast, in about fifteen minutes (compared to HULK's forty-five). I don't want to spoil any of the plot, other than to say that this film takes a more adult, mature approach to the material – both in the depth of emotion of the characters, in the handling of death, and in the rather violent action sequences.Said action – invariably incorporating martial arts, which is of course currently in vogue in Hollywood – is highly entertaining and the film as a whole is packed with special effects, which add to the impact rather than being really noticeable. The entire cast put in good performances, from Ben Affleck's subdued turn as the lead to the solid support of Jon Favreau, Joe Pantoliano and Leland Orser. Yet the most noticeable characters are Jennifer Garner as the truly electrifying Elektra, Michael Clarke Duncan as the impossibly imposing Kingpin, and best of all, Colin Farrell as mad henchman Bullseye. Farrell bags the best role in the film and really makes a meal of it, bringing humour to his psycho-schtick and enlivening the proceedings no end. The combination of the above factors serve to highlight DAREDEVIL as one of the triumphs of the Hollywood year!",Daredevil
4,SnoopyStyle,visually ugly for blind superhero,4,7 September 2013,"Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) was blinded by hazardous waste, but his other senses got heightened including a radar sense which allows him to ""see"" far better than any man. His boxer father nicknamed Devil was killed in an alley. He grows up to be a criminal attorney by day, and vigilante Daredevil by night. Foggy Nelson (Jon Favreau) is his associate and Karen Page (Ellen Pompeo) is their secretary. Reporter Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) is chasing the enigma. He is taken with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) who surprises him with her skills. Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan) is the corporate criminal overlord Kingpin. Bullseye (Colin Farrell) is his hired killer.It is fitting that a film about a blind superhero be so visually ugly. There are a lot facial close ups, color saturations, and slanted dizzying camera moves. The visual style is aggressively painful. It's also the CGI. Daredevil's special vision isn't any better. It's all blue and wavy. If it's supposed to give him superior visual skills, it doesn't look nice on the screen. The production value looks cheaper because of the attempt at a darker visual style without actually being darker. Ben Affleck as a blind guy really stifles his acting skills. The story is cartoonish in its comic book world. It's a flawed comic book movie.",Daredevil
5,Horst_In_Translation,Not as bad as they say,6,20 February 2016,"""Daredevil"" is a superhero movie from almost 15 years ago and this was made before Marvel's big revival through ""Iron Man"" and before Christopher Nolan gave us his dark take on ""Batman"". Instead, Sam Raimi's ""Spider Man"" was really en vogue at that time. And here, writer and director Mark Steven Johnson gave us his approach on the genre. I watched his director's cut that runs for an impressive over 130 minutes and stars Ben Affleck as the title character. Affleck was already an Oscar winner at that point (for writing though) and a big star for sure. Soon he will play another big name superhero, but his turn in ""Daredevil"" does not make me too enthusiastic about it. He may be a better director than actor. At times, it was painful to watch him here, how he totally did not manage to deliver a credible superhero performance. And the parts that were intended as comedy were even worse with him. Then again, a lot of that was probably due to the script. The idea of him being blind with mega-sharpened senses is a great one, but it was so overdone that it felt completely unrealistic. As if we could forget about him the way he is if he isn't hitting basketball shots in his office while his partner can't.Luckily, this kind of films always rises and falls with how good the antagonist is. And Colin Farrell as Bullseye is pretty good. He is scary, yet gimmicky and the best thing about him is that he never seems to take himself seriously. A great joy to watch in his scenes and clearly the MVP here. Michael Clarke Duncan plays the second antagonist and he is also good, but more due to his impressive stature than because of great acting. A worthy addition. Rest in peace, big man. Jon Favreau and Joe Pantoliano were fine too and made up a bit for the failure that Affleck was in here for the most part. Still he was not the worst aspect of this movie. This would unanimously go to Jennifer Garner, Affleck's longtime wife. Man was she unbearable. It already starts with the fact that she was not half as attractive as the makers want us to think here. And then her scenes were completely awful in terms of the contents too. All of a sudden, she is a super fighter who almost takes out Daredevil on her own when they fight? Where did that come from? Anyway, I wish they would have cast somebody else and written the character better, just like Daredevil himself.So all in all, this film is mostly worth seeing for Colin Farrell's fun performance. He gives it the perfectly right approach when he creates this cold-blooded killer, but still gives him an atmospheric awkwardness that adds so so much and makes his scenes the most watchable of the film. Seeing him here is very rewarding if you can stomach the scenes between Affleck and Garner. The story was in theory really good, but they did mess up on the details and most of the time they messed up a lot. I cannot really be too mad that they did not make a sequel for this one. It may have turned out even worse and I truly hope Affleck's next superhero film will have him give a better performance with a better-written character and I am not even talking about how generic he was most of the time, but about how it just did not feel credible anymore that he was hearing every little detail etc. Nonetheless I give this film a favorable review: Worth seeing for fans of superhero film lovers, even if it is not close to what it could have been with improvement in certain areas. Thumbs up.",Daredevil
6,claudio_carvalho,A Great and Underrated Action Movie,10,12 October 2003,"The story of the Daredevil, since when he was a boy, is the storyline of this movie. The plot presents how he became the lawyer Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) during the day and the blind hero in the night. The movie shows his accident with toxic waste, the incident with his father, his crush with the gorgeous Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) and this fight against crime, mainly against Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan). This excellent movie is completely underrated: the story of this Gothic and dark hero is very well presented, even for those viewers like me, who is not familiarized this character. The effects, showing how Daredevil 'sees' being blind are great. The heavy soundtrack is marvelous. The storyline and the characters are very well developed. I am a great fan of Ben Affleck, but I have never paid attention to this wonderful actress Jennifer Garner in other movies. Colin Farrell is great like the caricatural villain and Michael Clark Duncan is 'great', as usual. I have loved this movie, and recommend it for those who like action and fantasy movie. An excellent entertainment. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Demolidor"" (""The Demolisher"")",Daredevil
7,classicsoncall,"""How do you kill a man without fear?""",7,14 January 2015,"After considering all the haters for the movie out there I have to wonder about the fuss - this really wasn't that bad. Granted, no great marks for originality or creativity but the story and action was acceptable given the parameters for a blind super-hero. What probably mattered to me more, since I look for these touches in comic book movies, were the multiple references to the medium that your average movie goer wouldn't be in tune to. A number of Marvel/Daredevil names were referenced by characters in the picture, including that of acquitted rapist Quesada (for Joe Quesada, a Marvel editor and one time Daredevil artist), John Romita (boxing opponent for Jack Murdock), and the morgue attendant Kirby (for Sixties cover artist Jack Kirby). That last one was a bonus because the character of Kirby was portrayed by comic book writer as well as actor Kevin Smith. And adding to all that fun was the ubiquitous cameo of legendary Marvel creator Stan Lee; he was the man young Matt Murdock stopped from crossing the street. So with all that I didn't mind the over the top action so much or the somewhat inconsequential conclusion against the major villains. And say what you will about Ben Affleck, but when all is said and done, he'll have been the only actor when the next Batman film comes out to have portrayed both Marvel and DC Comic super-heroes. A pretty cool feat I would say.Addendum: *** I just reread my review and would note that Ben Affleck is not the only actor now who portrayed two super-heroes. In 2016, Ryan Reynolds appeared as Deadpool, following his 2011 casting as Green Lantern.",Daredevil
8,gavin6942,Affleck Before He Was Batman,6,30 September 2014,"A man (Ben Affleck) blinded by toxic waste which also enhanced his remaining senses fights crime as an acrobatic martial arts superhero.The film offers a broad overview of the Daredevil story, throws in Elektra, Kingpin, and Colin Farrell horribly miscast as Bullseye. (Anyone who thinks Duncan was miscast is a fool.) Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars and called the film good, despite noting the almost typical superhero background. Of the actors, he stated that Affleck and Jennifer Garner were suitable for their roles, while Duncan's presence alone was menacing. He finished by saying ""I am getting a little worn out describing the origin stories and powers of superheroes. Some of their movies, like this one, are better than others."" Most notably, the film brought together Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner and gave them a lasting marriage and children. Wow, a comic book romance!",Daredevil
9,jboothmillard,Daredevil,4,20 November 2009,"I remember seeing a short trailer for this superhero film, and I didn't think it looked too bad, but the critics give it two stars, so I had to see why, from director Mark Steven Johnson (Ghost Rider). Basically, in Hell's Kitchen, New York, after being blinded by a toxic waste chemical, which increases his other senses dramatically, young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra) loses his father Jack (David Keith) to an unknown man dropping a rose. Years later, Matt (Razzie winner Ben Affleck) has become a respected criminal attorney/lawyer, but by night he becomes ""The Man Without Fear,"" costumed and masked hero Daredevil. He one day meets (by smell and touch) Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), daughter of a wealthy tycoon, and they fall for each other quite quickly, and she is quite a skilled fighter also, with her knives. Daredevil has a new enemy though, the super-enhanced Bullseye (Colin Farrell), who never misses his targets, hired by big villain Wilson Fisk, aka The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan). Also starring Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urich, Jon Favreau as Franklin 'Foggy' Nelson, Ellen Pompeo as Karen Page, Kevin Smith as Jack Kirby - Forensic Assistant and Stan Lee as Old Man at Crossing. There are some good special effects, I didn't think Farrell was that bad, and even though the premise of a blind superhero is ridiculous nonsense, there is still some fun to be had. Okay!",Daredevil
10,ccthemovieman-1,It's True About The 'Director's Cut',7,15 November 2005,"First off, this was a more complete version of the DVD which came out earlier. In this edition, about a half-hour of new material was added to the disc (and what was shown at the theaters.) All reviews I read said it elevated this film from ""fair at best"" to ""good."" I agree. It made the movie much, much better.Yeah, it's more far-fetched than the other superhero movies because here, the hero is a blind guy who, because of his blindness, has extraordinary hearing powers along with the rest of the usual Batman/Spiderman-type athletic skills.As in most of the Batman films, this is a dark film. I think it would have been better had it lightened up a bit with a few jokes and a more wholesome female lead. Jennifer Garner is another one of these latter-day skinny chicks who is made to be tough-looking, tough-talking and tough-fighting. In other words: ridiculous. However, I will say she comes across a little more likable on the extended version. One more negative: the fight scenes go on a tad too long and are outlandish.On the positive side, this may be the best-sounding DVD I own, at least up to ones I had heard up until this came out in January of 2005. Since the hero (Ben Affleck) has super hearing, this is emphasized in this movie and so you, if you have a 5.1 surround system, hear sounds from all speakers at almost times. It's awesome!Affleck, meanwhile, is likable as the superhero and I liked the message he gives at the end about shunning revenge. Wow, you don't hear that much in movies. Kudos, too, to villains' Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. They are fun to watch, especially Farrell.So, if this superhero film interests you, make sure you get the ""Director's Cut"" edition. It's far better than the original, and, I believe, the same price.",Daredevil
11,Tweekums,A blind superhero determined to clean up New York's Hell's Kitchen,7,6 January 2017,"Growing up in Hell's Kitchen Matt Murdock was taught to avoid fights by his father, a washed up boxer who is working as an enforcer for a local mobster. When Matt learns the truth about what his father does he runs off and is involved in an accident; toxic watched is splashed in his eyes; he is instantly blinded but as a side effect his other senses are drastically improved; notably his hearing which is now so acute that he can use it like sonar! He uses these skills to train himself to fight for justice.Grown up he has become a lawyer who represents the innocent by day and takes vengeance against those who have escaped justice by night in the guise of Daredevil; a masked avenger. His ultimate goal is to discover the identity of 'King Pin' a notorious, almost legendary, crime lord who is behind most of the crime in the area. While doing this he meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios, the daughter of a businessman who has dealings with King Pin, who is trained in martial arts to a level that matches his own skills. King Pin brings assassin 'Bullseye' into the country to eliminate Elektra's father when he tries to end their dealings. The events that follow will turn Elektra against Daredevil before he can finally confront King Pin.While this isn't one of the best superhero movies it is rather fun. Ben Affleck does a solid enough job in the lead role; especially when in the 'Matt Murdock' persona when he is in the Daredevil costume he is still entertaining but is mostly involved in action rather than things that show his character's development. Jenifer Garner is equally impressive as Elektra; it helps that her character gets stuck into the action rather than being a stereotypical damsel in distress. Michael Clarke Duncan is suitably imposing as King Pin and I liked Joe Pantoliano's performance as a journalist obsessed with the Daredevil; it was fun seeing him play somebody good for a change. I was less convinced by Colin Farrell as Bullseye; this was largely down to his ridiculous appearance a shaved head with a target on his forehead; something that probably looked cool in the original comic but here looked a bit too silly rather than scary. The overall story is entertaining and the action is plentiful and exciting. Overall I wouldn't say this is a must see film but it is worth checking out if you are a fan of the superhero genre.",Daredevil
12,BA_Harrison,N.B. This review is of the Director's Cut of Daredevil.,7,28 December 2014,"Blinded by bio-hazardous waste as a child, Matt Murdock finds that his other senses have developed to the point where they afford him almost supernatural physical abilities. Years later, Murdock (Ben Affleck), now a pro-bono lawyer, takes on the guise of night-time vigilante Daredevil, using his powers to ensure that justice is always served. In doing so, he finds himself pitted against crime boss Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), his hired hit-man Bullseye (Colin Farrell, who hams it up wonderfully in every scene), and kick-ass babe Elektra (Jennifer Garner), who mistakenly holds Daredevil responsible for the death of her father.The recent casting of Ben Affleck as Batman has been the cause of much controversy amongst comic book fans, but judging by Daredevil, the star's previous foray into comicdom, I'm not all that concerned, this fun movie proving the actor to be more than capable in the role of superhero. Affleck acquits himself surprisingly well as both the laudable lawyer and his leather-clad alter-ego, providing the character with the necessary depth and the required physicality.If this longer version still proves less than perfect, it is not down to Affleck, but once again due to the script and the directorial style (I guess some things just can't be fixed). With an extra thirty minutes, The Director's Cut fleshes out the characters and makes more sense of the narrative, but at the expense of the pacing; in addition, the poorly lit visuals makes some of the action hard to follow (I understand that the look and feel is intended to emulate the style of Frank Miller's comic book artwork, which makes great use of heavy shadow, but director Mark Steven Johnson takes things a step too far).Over the last decade, Marvel have gradually honed their product to meet maximum audience approval, boosting their budgets and throwing the best special effects available onto the screen, but as one of the earliest postmillenial attempts to bring their characters to the big screen (yes Daredevil is already well over a decade old) this is still a serviceable effort, with only the occasional iffy CGI shot belying its age.",Daredevil
13,sunwarrior13,Daredevil Is Passable Entertainment,8,12 October 2012,"Daredevil is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.It stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who fights for justice in the courtroom and out of the courtroom as the masked vigilante Daredevil. Jennifer Garner plays his love interest Elektra Natchios; Colin Farrell plays the merciless assassin Bullseye; David Keith plays Jack ""The Devil"" Murdock, a washed up fighter who is Matt's father; and Michael Clarke Duncan plays Wilson Fisk, also known as the crime lord Kingpin. Jon Favreau, Joe Pantoliano, and David Keith highlight Daredevil's supporting cast.It was written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson.Matthew Murdock is a lawyer whose father, a prizefighter, was killed by gangsters when Murdock was just a boy. Since then, Murdock has devoted his life to bringing wrongdoers to justice and is willing to help others by taking on cases no other attorney will touch. Murdock is also blind, after being struck down by a truck while trying to save a man from being hit. What no one knows is that Murdock was also doused with an unusual radioactive isotope which had a strange effect on him while Murdock's sight may be gone, his other senses have been raised to such a keen pitch that they act like radar, allowing him to tell where he's going and what happens around him, both near and far away. Murdock puts his gifts to use at night as the costumed crime-fighter Daredevil, whose pursuit of justice has earned him the wrath of underworld leader Kingpin ,who wants Daredevil out of his way once and for all, and hires Bullseye, a super-assassin with an uncanny ability to throw blades, to do the job. Daredevil also makes the acquaintance of Elektra Natchios, a woman with super-heroic talents who is also on Kingpin's bad side, though it remains to be seen if she has aligned herself with the forces of good as Daredevil has done.The film has electric energy, a wickedly dark sense of humor, some ingenious fight scenes and that high-powered cast.Passable if derivative as entertainment despite the fact that Ben Affleck fits the role.Overall,it is not up to par with recent superhero films.",Daredevil
14,LeonLouisRicci,Underrated and a Needs a Reconsideration,9,17 February 2016,"This One Needs a Fresh Look. Mostly Eviscerated and Maligned upon its initial Release, Today can be Viewed as a Dark, Melancholic, Character Study of one of Marvel's more Brooding and Wounded Characters.Similar to Batman (1989) in Tone and Style, much of the Movie is Shot in the Dark amidst Urban Decay, Back Alleys, and has a general Ominous Feel. Ben Affleck was given No Quarter and was systematically Booed across the board, but Considering what Type of Film and Character that ""Daredevil"" is revealing, it Fits Quite Well.This isn't a Bouncy and Comedic Superhero Movie, quite the Opposite, although Jon Favreau does His Best to Lighten the Mood a bit as Matt Murdock's Lawyer Partner. The Film is full of Stylish, Foreboding Scenes at Night and in the Rain. It's 2003 CGI is put to some Good Use, but Admittedly some of the Stuff seems a bit Clunky or Dated Today, but Effective nonetheless.Jennifer Garner Shows Up as Elektra and Enhances every Scene where She appears, as does the Psychopathic Portrayal of ""Bullseye"" by Colin Farrell that adds some Crazy Appeal. Michael Clarke Duncan as ""Kingpin"" Plays the hulking Crimelord and Menaces the Third Act.This really is an Excellent Rendition of the Daredevil with the ""Director's Cut"" the Only ""Cut"" that's Recommended. There are Brutal Killings and some Bloody Action Scenes and it is all Done with a Neo-Noir Appeal. It reinstates the Darkness and Gloom to another level where it Belongs and Fits the rest of the Movie that in the Theatrical Release Sacrificed the Edginess and went for the Safe PG-13 Rating. It isn't a Quantum Leap but a Needed Leap.",Daredevil
15,poolandrews,Average comic book superhero flick.,5,3 January 2008,"Daredevil is set in New York where the blind Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a good willed lawyer helping the poor by day & a leather clad superhero known as Daredevil by night who uses his other super sensitive senses to fight crime & dish out a little justice. Rumours continue to persist that one man known as Kingpin controls all the crime in New York, that man happens to be Wilson Fisk (Michael Clark Duncan). After one of his associates Nikolas Natchios (Erick Avari) wants out the Kingpin calls in assassin for hire Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to kill him, while doing so Daredevil tries to stop him but fails & is blamed for Natchios death himself. Now a wanted murderer Daredevil has to prove his innocence & bring the bad guy's down...Written & directed by Mark Steven Johnson Daredevil was being made at the time the whole Marvel comic book superhero film adaptation had become big business after the success of both Blade (1998) & in particular the huge box-office returns of Spider-Man (2002), it was one of the first to jump on the comic book superhero bandwagon & has been followed by the likes of Hulk (2003), Fantastic Four (2005) & the upcoming Iron Man (2008) to name but some. First one has to say that Daredevil is another one of those annoying films which are frustratingly available in two distinct versions, a theatrical cut & a director's cut which not only added 30 minutes of extra material but also removed several scenes as well. With added sub-plots including one featuring the rapper Coolio which is totally absent from the theatrical cut, the removal of the love scene between Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner along with other alterations as well as more violence to up the rating from a PG to an R there are obviously significant changes between the two which alter the story & character's in it. I will be basing my comment on the shorter theatrical cut & I just have to get it off my chest now, I think studios who release director's cuts so soon after the theatrical one has played are doing so purely to make more money from us, the fans, & it bugs me no end. Anyway rant over, the script here is distinctly average & tries to go for a dark gritty feel rather than the over-the-top cartoony antics of the likes if Spider-Man & it doesn't really pull it off. The character of Daredevil isn't one of Marvel's most popular superhero creations & to be honest you can see why, he's just not that engaging or has that much personality. The Elektra character seems out of place but luckily isn't in it that much while the basic story is rather poor, Kingpin & Bullseye barely feature for the first hour & you never get the sense Kingpin is really evil. He just looks like a big fat bald black guy who goes down far too easily at the end, wimp. Seeing Daredevil fight crime in a mucky looking New York just isn't as much fun as watching Spider-Man do the same in a bright Manhattan, well that's what I think anyway. As far as the whole 'person with superpowers who uses them to fight crime & in someway hopes to find redemption for a dark past' scenario goes this is strictly average & some might say predictable stuff all the way.Director Johnson has more recently made the better Ghost Rider (2007) comic book adaptation with Nicholas Cage, here he does OK & gives the film a dark Gothic sometimes film noir look about it which saves it from being a complete waste of time. The action scenes aren't anything to write home about, in fact I barely remember any of them at all & I only watched it a few hours ago. The fight between Bullseye & Daredevil is probably about as good as it gets with the final confrontation between Kingpin & Daredevil coming across as very low key & just rather poor. The CGI computer effects are pretty good, from Daredevil jumping from window cleaning platforms to scale down the side of a skyscraper to Bullseye being able to ride a motorbike while standing on the seat... One more aspect of daredevil I didn't think worked was the costume, I'm sorry but I thought Affleck looked awful in it & it looked like it belong in the 'Gimp' scene in Pulp Fiction (1994)! Was it just me or was the funeral scene with the Evanescence song playing in the background the most embarrassing & misjudged scene in the whole film?According to the IMDb Daredevil started out with a budget of about $50,000,000 which 20th Century Fox upped to nearer $80,000,000 when Spider-Man started breaking all box-office records. It's well made for sure, the CGI effects are decent while the few stunts & fights look good. The acting is alright, Affleck is OK while flavour of the month at the time Colin Farrell & Jennifer garner are pretty poor.Daredevil sort of jumped on the whole comic book superhero bandwagon & as a result seems to me to be one of the lesser entries in the genre, well the theatrical cut is anyway. Produced the spin-off film Elektra (2005) with Jennifer Garner reprising her role & incredibly is much, much worse than Daredevil is, in fact Elektra makes Daredevil look like a masterpiece by comparison.",Daredevil
16,CinemaSerf,Blind Man's Buff - but that's about the height of it...,6,14 October 2021,"This film feels longer than just 100 minutes! Ben Affleck (""Matt Murdock"") is the eponymous super-hero who is blinded by an accident with some toxic waste but as a result, has acute hearing and sensitivity to movement. He spends his days as a lawyer, his nights à-la ""Spiderman"" as a bit of a vigilante trying keep the streets of New York's infamous ""Hell's Kitchen"" clear of criminals. Lately, his sights have become firmly set on the ""Kingpin"" (Colin Farrell) - the biggest baddie of them all, but a man whom the courts cannot incarcerate. His masked mission now becomes to bring this man to justice. This is a quickly paced, and colourful extravaganza - plenty of action, the visual effects are good and a premiss just a little different. The dialogue is pretty banal, Farrell is dreadful - a ham if I ever I saw one, and the action scenes are just a little bit too repetitive and dull after a while. Affleck brings little charisma to the screen and the romance with Jennifer Garner (""Electric Nachos"" - or something similar) was gloopy and dragged the pace down all too often before an ending that, well - is just daft. It's harmless fun but I don't think I would bother watching it again.",Daredevil
17,zardoz-13,Affleck Is Good As Daredevil!!!,8,16 May 2015,"""Daredevil"" is another action hero in the Marvel Universe. Although the theatrical version of ""Daredevil"" lacked punch, the director's cut more than makes up it with its added thirty minutes. Matt Murdock is an unfortunate child who is blinded by chemicals and can no longer see. Ironically, when he is blinded, the other senses increase in power so although he has lost the power of sight, he can still navigate the terrain where he lives. When he grows up, he begins a lawyer but he is also Daredevil, a masked vigilante who tangles with the city's worst villains. Matt almost meets his match when he encounters Bulls Eye (Colin Farrell) who knows how to sling things like darts as well as a wide variety of other weapons. Matt is up against his toughest adversary when he takes on Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan of ""The Green Mile"") who rules New York City with an iron fist. Along the way, Matt meets the love of his life, Elektra (Jennifer Garner of ""Elektra"") who matches wits and blows with him in a school recess yard. Ben Affleck is very charismatic as the nimble, agile Daredevil, and his scene with Stan Lee is very amusing. The director's cut of ""Daredevil"" is required watching if you're a hardcore Marvel Comics fanatic.",Daredevil
18,Boba_Fett1138,The Director's cut is awesome!,7,4 April 2006,"I had seen the theatrical version of ""Daredevil"" a couple of months ago. I hated it. I thought it was dreadful and it was lacking in its story, characters and pace. The movie was incredibly weak and totally uninteresting to watch because it lacked substance. Still I decided to give the director's cut a chance. I'm glad I did, for the Director's cut is so much better to watch. The pace is better, the story makes more sense and the characters are more involving. The theatrical version was lame, the Director's cut is awesome!The Director's cut takes its time to build up the story and its characters. The Director's cut is about 30 minutes longer than the original version and most of that time is spend on extended scene's with the characters. Suddenly because of that not only the characters but also the story became more understandable and interesting. Especially the villains became so much better. Colin Farrell as Bullseye gets more opportunity to show his coolness and his character became so much more cooler now. He also really seemed to be enjoying himself playing this villainous over-the-top role. Same goes for Michael Clarke Duncan. Main reason why his character didn't really worked in the original version was because his character had quite limited screen time. The only part of the movie in which he was prominent present was the ending. In the Director's cut he gets to show more evil and his character becomes so much more villainous. Also the Joe Pantoliano character no longer makes a pointless impression and he gets to play a way more important part in the movie. Same goes for the Leland Orser, Derrick O'Connor and Erick Avari characters. Because the movie takes its time to build up the characters suddenly everything in the movie just makes more sense and everything suddenly fits and feels right.Because the story flows so much better I can now actually say that ""Daredevil"" is a really cool movie to watch. The action sequences also suddenly are way more exciting. They are nicely choreographed and edited together.Sure, the movie still does have its flaws and it still is far from the best superhero comic-book movie ever made but its just the fact that the Director's cut is so incredibly much better than the original theatrical version that causes my sudden (late) enthusiasm for this movie.Lets do the world a favor, lets all burn the theatrical versions and lets all embrace the Director's cut.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Daredevil
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"A ""marvelous"" comic book film... and the Director's Cut makes it even better",7,24 March 2007,"After the utter failure of the fourth Batman film, at the hands of the effective, if not awfully talented, director Joel Schumacher, Hollywood took a break from the sub-genre of superhero movies. The last two films of that franchise had been too silly and ""comical"" for the fans, and... well, yeah, too silly for everyone else, as well. When Bryan Singer made X-Men in 2000, all of us fans rejoiced... a new chance for our favorite characters to be treated to the time they deserve on the silver screen. Two years later, Sam Raimi released Spider-Man... personally, I did not care for that movie(as my scathing review of said film reveals immediately), and this film was subsequently widely overlooked. People claimed this to be a rip-off and an inferior film. I disagree. There may be similarities, but I found this to be the better film. This didn't feel glossy or flashy... this felt serious, real. This is a superhero who gets hurt, who doesn't always win. I haven't read too many of the Daredevil comic books, but from what I can tell, this film is fairly accurate. Sure, they changed back-story... but some artistic license is necessary to make it work(and yes, I realize that I complain about this very aspect of Spiderman in that review); Catwoman has, after all, yet to be depicted as a cat burglar. The key elements are present herein, as best as I can tell. The choice of villains is rather good, I think, as well as the other characters. The special effects are great(with a couple of evident exceptions), with almost perfectly smooth CGI that blends well with the live action elements. The action is nicely choreographed, filmed and edited, and the film is definitely intense when it needs to be. There is style to it(sometimes a little too much), and the editing is rather good throughout. The writing varies, but much of it is clever and just about all of it works. The casting is mostly spot-on; Garner has the femininity coupled with the ability to pull off cool action moves believably(the latter presumably partially gathered during her time on Alias), Duncan has the stature and the presence(as for him being black... how many white actors has a matching physique *and* those acting capabilities?), Farell comes off as the psychopath that he should, and Pantoliano has the determination to be Urich. Affleck may not have been the best choice for the title role... he simply does not seem to be a terribly credible action star, as my fiancée also pointed out after having watched Paycheck. However, he does fit quite well as Matt Murdock. Favreau is a good Foggy, if different from the comics(still providing comic relief... pun intended, courtesy of my fiancée), and he plays off Affleck pretty well. Garner and Affleck have playful chemistry together on-screen. The acting ranges, but is mostly very good. The pacing is nearly perfect, especially in the DC. In fact, just about everything about the film is improved upon in it, and I urge anyone who enjoys the theatrical to get it(though do note that it is rated R... for anyone bothered by the added language, sexuality(what little there is) and violence)... and anyone who thought it could have been better after watching the original version to give it another chance. Coolio, added in this, also does well, and has funny moments(just as Favreau, Affleck and Garner). The tone is darker than other superhero/comic book films(The Punisher being the exception to that rule), and it fits. All in all, a comic book/superhero flick of very high(though not perfect) quality. The DVD holds a featurette about the changes, which isn't bad at all, and a commentary track with Avi Arad and Mark Steven Johnson, that is definitely worth listening to, informational and entertaining(be aware that it's relatively... unrestrained in the use of cussing, for at least a handful or so of occasions). I recommend this to any fan of superheroes, movies about them and/or the source material. 7/10",Daredevil
20,view_and_review,"Daredevil released on coat tails of Spiderman, can't compete but still good",7,7 March 2007,"With Spiderman having come out in 2002 and being a Mega-success, Daredevil had a hard act to follow. Daredevil was not that bad, it was just a victim of bad timing. I'll be the first to admit that I was holding Daredevil to a high standard even before watching the movie. The movie had a nice enough story to it, it actually intertwined two stories together. There wasn't much action or fighting to rave about until the end. The showdown with Daredevil and Bulls Eye was satisfying, and the eventual showdown with Daredevil and The Kingpin was equally gratifying. Besides Michael Clarke-Duncan being black, he was the spot on choice for the role of The Kingpin. For a comic book movie, it didn't get me excited or to the edge of my seat, but I will tell you what impressed me the most... the fact that they killed the woman that was the closest thing Daredevil had to a love interest. That rarely happens, and it takes a lot of daring and courage to buck that trend. That alone made the movie that much better. It's not that I like to see women killed or anything, but in so many Hollywood productions it is taboo to kill women and children (no matter how incredibly dumb and annoying they are, or the fact that everyone is in the uncompromising position they're in due to the said dumb woman and/or child), yet men will go out and be slaughtered left and right as though they are wholly expendable and the community and or earth will just regenerate another man in his place. Kudos to Daredevil and others like it that have the guts to kill, not just a meaningless female extra, but a significant player. Of course she comes back to life to make Elektra.",Daredevil
21,neil-476,Didn't quite work for me,7,16 March 2011,"Something about this film didn't quite cut it for me, despite the fact that I love superhero comics. Perhaps it's the fact that Daredevil was never a favourite - essentially a riff on Batman with the blindness/enhanced senses to distinguish him, he was never a character whose comics I badly wanted to read. Perhaps it's the fact that Jennifer Garner is not an actress who makes me want to queue at the cinema door to catch her movies.Which is not to say that I didn't enjoy Daredevil, because I did. I particularly liked the origin sequence, and the way that Daredevil's senses were shown. The plot was OK, Michael Clarke Duncan was a great Kingpin, Colin Farrell was a terrific Bullseye, Ben Affleck was not bad as Matt Murdock (I think he is better in supporting roles than leads), and the action was all well done.I could live with the costume.I didn't much care for the story being told in flashback, and I had a great deal of trouble dealing with the fact that the film appeared to be set in the real world (as opposed to a world where superheroics/superpowers are clearly part of the set-up) and yet Daredevil could leap off rooftops and land many stories below without suffering any physical damage - I was not at all sure how chemicals in the eyes could accomplish that!",Daredevil
22,Uriah43,Dull and Dreary,4,11 September 2016,"Blinded as a child and bullied by others in school, a young boy is traumatized by his father's killing at the hands of organized crime. Upon becoming an adult the lawyer named ""Matt Murdock"" (Ben Affleck) decides to put his extraordinary senses, acquired from the radioactive solution which took his eyesight, to avenge the victims of bullies and thugs as the superhero known as ""Daredevil"". What he doesn't count on is a relationship with a beautiful woman by the name of ""Elektra Natchios"" (Jennifer Garner) who has enemies of her own who are more dangerous than anybody he has ever encountered. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I was quite excited when this movie first came out. Unfortunately, I must confess that I was more than a little disappointed after seeing it. To be more specific, although the scenes involving the origin of Daredevil were quite good, the rest of the movie seemed rather dark, dull and dreary afterward. There was simply too much talk and not enough action. At least that is how it appeared to me. In any case, with all of the resources available, I believe this movie could have been much better and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",Daredevil
23,anaconda-40658,Dare Not to Fall Asleep.,5,6 May 2015,"Daredevil (2003): Dir: Mark Steven Johnson / Cast: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell, Michael Clarke Duncan, Joe Pantoliano: Suppose to represent the ability to face fear but the screenwriter took the biggest dare. Fantastic production marred by laughable writing. Effective setup regards Daredevil's father killed in a boxing incident. Blinded by a toxic substance his other senses are a notch above. Then action violence clichés set in. Well directed by Mark Steven Johnson but justice reduced to pounding the villain to a pulp. Ben Affleck delivers his worst performance since Pearl Harbor. Jennifer Garner plays another superhero named Elecktra. She is the daughter of a kingpin whose purpose is to scrap and have sex with Daredevil. Their embarrassing battle upon playground equipment had the audience in hysterics. Colin Farrell misses the mark as villain Bullseye. Perhaps had this character not shared his name with the horse in Toy Story 2 then perhaps we could take him a bit more seriously. Michael Clarke Duncan as a kingpin leader does little more than blow cigar smoke into the camera. Perhaps he was that embarrass with the film that clouding the camera was all he could do to avoid being seen. Joe Pantoliano is wasted as a investigative journalist whose goal should be to find a better screenwriter. Theme of defects is placed within a film that is full of them. Score: 5 / 10",Daredevil
24,FlashCallahan,I want an effin costume.....,6,8 April 2012,"In Hell's Kitchen, lives Matt Murdock and his father, who is a boxer.One day, Matt runs into a industrial accident and becomes blind after his eyes are exposed to a toxic chemical, but it also gives him other supernatural senses.Then, his father is killed by a mysterious figure.Matt, who is now a lawyer by day, is also Daredevil, who hunts criminals by night.He then, meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios, a daughter of a wealthy tycoon.But, what Matt does not know is that a wealthy executive going by the name ""Kingpin"", has hired another named ""Bullseye"", who always hits his target.Now, he must stop Bullseye and the Kingpin....When I first saw this movie nine years ago, I thought it was one of the best comic book adaptations out there. Then came Nolan and more or less every marvel film after Iron Man, and my opinion of this has lowered and lowered.The problem with the movie is Affleck, he just doesn't cut it as the man without fear, and the costume is probably one of the worst in Comic book hero history.The story is decidedly ho-hum, and the narrative a little dodgy, but thank heavens for Farrell as Bullseye, he saves the movie from being just average, and whenever he is in it, the film is a must see.The film is inventive in some scenes, and his 'vision' has some really good scenes, but when the titular character is very boring and lacks personality, the film begins to suffer.",Daredevil
25,Aaron1375,excellent flick...better than I thought it would be.,10,17 February 2003,"I was expecting a good movie, but I didn't know I would enjoy it as much as I did.  I am an avid Spider-man fan, and only have seen Daredevil when he makes an apperance in Spider-man, but I have to say even though I am a Spidey fan I didn't like Spider-man much more than Daredevil.  A little, but not by much.  The movie is fast paced and extremely cool.  One person wrote they didn't like the soundtrack, but I loved it...I prefer some rock and alternative music cut in with the action rather than hearing the bland scores that accompany most big time movies these days.  All the actors I thought were good too.  Ben Affleck was great as Daredevil, Jennifer Garner was good as Electra and Michael Clark Duncan made a good Kingpin as well. Even though Kingpin in the comics is white I think Duncan is one of the few actors that has the size to play the part.  Though the one that stole the show was Colin Ferrel as the assassin Bullseye...he brought great energy to his role.  Jon Favreau plays Daredevil's law partner and he is good as well. This comic adaptation also seems to be darker and more geared to adults than other comic book movies as there are a couple of rather graphic death scenes.  All in all this one was great.",Daredevil
26,Wuchakk,The Director's Cut Is my Personal favorite Superhero Film,9,6 January 2012,"My favorite comic heroes included The Thing, The Fantastic Four, Conan, The Flash, Wolverine, The X-Men, Captain America (and the Falcon), Tarzan, Spider-Man and Daredevil. What intrigued me about Daredevil was that, although he was very similar to Batman (and, to a lesser extent, Spider-Man), he was BLIND.Daredevil really started to get hot when Frank Miller and, later, Ann Nocenti wrote for the comic in the 80s (Nocenti's run started out unimpressive but slowly became outstanding).With this understanding I was naturally excited to see the film rendition of ""Daredevil"" that debuted in February 2003. After seeing the movie I thought it wasn't bad. They got a lot right -- like Daredevil's costume, the mood and the casting (this was my first exposure to Ben Affleck so I had no beef with him playing Matt Murdock/Daredevil). Still, there was something wrong with the picture; it was too light and brisk. Yes, it certainly had pizazz, but it was mostly superhero fluff with little depth -- a perfect example of style over substance. Plus the cutesy playground scene where Matt first meets Elektra was out of place.The Director's Cut reveals what went wrong: Some studio dork made the idiotic decision to cut out the meat of the story, which naturally dumbed down the film. In plain language: THE FILM WAS GUTTED.All I can say is: Thank God for director's cut DVDs! Two years after its theatrical release I picked up the Director's Cut of ""Daredevil"" and was blown away. The director, Mark Steven Johnson, took out some unnecessary fluff, like the premature Matt/Elektra sex scene, and added over 30 minutes of material that was integral to the story and SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN CUT in the first place. This new material centers around the character-defining subplot of Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson working on a case that ties into the whole Kingpin storyline. Many say the fight scenes are also superior in the Director's Cut, which is hard to tell unless you view both versions back-to-back.WHAT WORKS: Everything about this film magically works. Colin Farrell is entertaining as the crazed Bullseye, Jon Favreau is splendid as Foggy, and Michael Clarke Duncan is outstanding as The Kingpin; yeah, I know they deviated with the skin color, but who gives a hoot anyway? The soundtrack, which includes selections from various heavy bands, is stupendous. The touching scenes are truly touching, like when Matt & Elektra share intimate moments on the roof and Elektra's solo workout, and the kick-axx parts are really kick-axx. Two great songs by Evanescence are featured: ""Bring Me To Life"" and ""My Immortal."" There are a lot of great lines in the film as well, in particular from The Kingpin and Bullseye (""Tell me, how do you kill a man without fear?"" ""By putting the fear IN him"").Daredevil's origin story is also perfect -- emotionally charged but not over-long or needlessly complicated like ""Hulk"" (2003).One of the greatest successes of this film is simply the mood. It's dark and reverent at the same time. Daredevil is perfectly portrayed as the tortured loner; Affleck does a fantastic job.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The aforementioned cutesy playground scene was obviously included for fun and to liven things up at that point, but it doesn't belong; it destroys the believability of the picture and characters. It should have been omitted from the Director's Cut. Still, it's not that bad. I can tolerate it, and admit that it is a fun scene, if nothing else.Jennifer Garner is good but she doesn't really fit the character of Elektra from the comics. She has a quality to her disposition that's simply too innocent, pure and likable. Not that these are bad traits, of course; they just don't fit the character of Elektra, an assassin. Kelly Hu, who played Lady Deathstrike in X2, would've been the perfect choice. Still, I personally don't mind Ms. Garner in the role; it's an acceptable deviation (one must allow some latitude in comic-to-screen adaptations).BOTTOM LINE: ""Daredevil: The Director's Cut"" ranks up there with the best superhero films of all-time. In fact, it's my personal favorite. If you haven't yet seen the Director's Cut get a copy and see for yourself. I encouraged a friend who's in the comics business to view the Director's Cut. His appraisal of the theatrical cut was (understandably) a mediocre 6/10 Stars, but after seeing the Director's Cut he raised his rating to 9.5/10 Stars! Like me, he was stupefied that the decision was actually made to gut-out such important story elements in the theatrical release.Ahh, but all is well with the Director's Cut.

28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Daredevil,8,11 January 2005,"This is the first of a series of Marvel comic heroes coming onto the silver screen this year, before Bryan Singer's X2 and Lee Ang's The Incredible Hulk (another Jennifer... Connelly,.... WHOA!) To compare it to last year's Spider-man will not be fair, because Daredevil is essentially a dark character, and i'm glad they stuck to it.There are complains that the movie is at times incoherent, but hey, it's based on a comic book! Sit back, relax and enjoy the show as if it's the first time u picked up a Daredevil comic and enjoying it for what it's worth.Ben Affleck once mentioned that he won't don any tights unless it's a Daredevil movie, and guess what, he's right! He looks the part as the Man Without Fear, the strong jawline and all, and as blind lawyer Matt Murdock. Guess he made Daredevil his own.Jennifer Gardner's Elektra looks as beautiful as she is lethal, but too bad, we're given little screen time where she is Elektra with her twin Sais. But nonetheless her initial meeting with Matt is really, really cool! Kingpin, in case you didn't know, is not the white character he is in the comic books, but heck, doesn't bother me a bit.And someone tell Bullseye to stock up on his ammo before he even attempts to take out Daredevil :P All in all, the action is sometimes too fast and dark (hey, it's a dark movie :P), but the SFX for the devil's unique capability is really well done. The introductory background to the Daredevil lore and build up is excellent, though the ending i felt was a little too rushed. Fan boys will lap up all the cameos and name-mentioning of people like Kirby, Quesada, et al.All in all, I suppose Marvel got it right this time with the movies. Awaiting X2 and Incredible Hulk to see if Marvel can do a hattrick with its movies this year.Have Faith.",Daredevil

They did a nice job with Foggy (Jon Favreau was a appropriate choice . . . same for Duncan), but Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan are all good actors in badly-written roles.Not the worst, but could've (should've) been a lot better.

30,whpratt1,Different Type of Superman!,9,7 November 2005,"Had some doubts if I was going to enjoy viewing this film and while I was watching the opening credits, my mind thought of Captain Marvel Comic books and his many adventures years ago. Ben Affleck,(Matt Murdock),""Gigli"",03, played Daredevil and got himself so deeply involved with protecting the general public from mobsters, he even had to go to confession and completely confused his poor Priest friend. There are lots of crazy characters playing real bad mobsters, and lots of ballet dancing type of combat scenes. Jennifer Garner,(Elektra Natchios),""Elektra"",'05 gave Matt Murdock a hard time in many ways, and managed to wrap him around her finger. Elektra and Matt gave an outstanding performance through out the picture and it was very entertaining and worth while viewing.",Daredevil
31,namashi_1,A Decent Effort!,6,11 August 2011,"'Daredevil' is A Decent Effort! Not a great one though. Reason? The Topsy-Turvy screenplay, that appeals in bits and pieces. Also, this Superhero Flick is too dark & will not really appeal to the kids. 'Daredevil' stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who fights for justice in the courtroom and out of the courtroom as the masked vigilante Daredevil. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, 'Daredevil' offers entertainment, here and there. The film begins with a Bang, dips in the second hour, but successfully reaches to an impressive culmination, which is nicely executed. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is decent, while his Direction deserves a mention. However, the overall impact of it's Superhero, is slightly missing. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is fair. Action-Sequences, are first-rate. Performance-Wise: Ben Affleck is fantastic as Matt Murdock/Daredevil. The Actor sinks his teeth into the part, and delivers one of his best performances to date. He steals the show, all the way! Jennifer Garner is effective. Colin Farrell has been better, while Michael Clarke Duncan makes an interesting bad guy. Jon Favreau supports well. Joe Pantoliano is likable. David Keith appears in a brief role. On the whole, A Decent Fare, that can be viewed once.",Daredevil
32,StevePulaski,A directorial miscommunication,6,16 August 2012,"NOTE: This is a review of the director's cut of Daredevil, which I have been informed countless times is the definitive version of the film. It invites the new subplot of Matt Murdock defending a client in a court case, and apparently ties up loose ends the theatrical cut left open.Daredevil's problem isn't that its hero is not as well known as some of the other Marvel alumni, but that its plan isn't a well-developed one. Its first mistake is incorporating actors for their names and not their proper skills. Its second is that the film isn't sure whether to take the approach of a goofy, imaginative romp or a seriously dark excursion. And third, well, it just isn't as fun as Marvel's Spider-Man or even Hellboy, which would come a year later.Our hero is the title character, played efficiently by Ben Affleck. Affleck's name alone could've turned off anyone at the time because of the constant tabloid exploitation with him and his girlfriend/fiancée Jennifer Lopez, which led to his name being associated with ridicule and mockery (Phantoms anyone?). When he's not the masked-vigilante, Daredevil is attorney Matt Murdock, who was tragically blinded after a toxic waste accident. This accident corrupted his vision, but exponentially enhanced his four other senses, and sort of giving his vision an odd demotion to only being able to see sonic vibrations.Matt's father was, by the book, a bum. A former professional boxer, he lied to his son about working at the biohazard plant, and upon discovering that his father was an enforcer for the local mob, he attempted to run away from home, which is what triggered the accident. His father went back to being a boxer for a brief time afterwards until he was tragically murdered. Matt went on to pursue training in martial arts, and eventually became ""Daredevil,"" a crime-fighting hero in his hometown of Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan.But what superhero film is complete without a villain and a love story? The villain here is Colin Farrell's Bullseye, a hit-man who simply doesn't want Daredevil to succeed. Bullseye was hired by William Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan), a rich executive who serves as his right-hand man and a secondary villain. Both of their motivations for evil are inexcusably underwritten.The love story is corny and a tad distracting. The lady is Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), the daughter of a famous businessman. Mat and her meet at a coffee-shop, where he tries to be polite and get her name. She playfully refuses and leaves. Next thing you know, both Matt and Elektra are fighting on a playground outside like two young children. Needless to say, if the entire film played on that kind of level, scenes like this wouldn't induce eye-rolling but cheerful grins.This ignites the film's major problem and that is it doesn't know what beat to drum Daredevil's song to. It doesn't know whether to be dark and gritty or campy and fun. The playground fight scene, Colin Farrell's over-the-top villain, and Jon Favreau's banter on Affleck say one thing, but the atmosphere, overall tone, and fight scenes say another. There is a miscommunication with direction that is perhaps one of the most fatal to a superhero film I've ever seen. The action sequences, on the other hand, are for the most part engaging and fun to watch. Even if the ""sonic vibrations"" POV becomes a bit distracting, it's fair to recognize Marvel's ambition to do something unique and innovative.Not long ago, Affleck gave an interesting interview about Daredevil, where he stated that it was made right before superhero films became very serious and crafty. It was made in that awkward period where unfamiliar heroes began surfacing (IE: Catwoman, Elektra, Hellboy, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, etc) and stylistic intentions began taking over (IE: Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films and Christopher Nolan's Batman revival, which would question just what the genre could do a mere two years after this). Watching Daredevil in 2012 is an indescribable experience, especially to those who aren't a big fan of it. Do we simply not care for the film, or do we not like the film because we've been shown the current revolution? The same question could be asked to those who are not fond of classic films of any genre.Starring: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan, Colin Farrell, and Jon Favreau.

34,OllieSuave-007,Not a bad superhero flick.,7,13 January 2014,"In this superhero flick, Ben Affleck stars as orphan Matt Murdock, who has a ""radar sense"" that allows him to sense better than any man. He becomes an attorney in his adult years and takes on an alter ego named Daredevil that patrols the neighborhoods of New York City to fight crime.There are some descent action in the film with some pretty good acting, but with a slow-paced plot. Afflect and Jennifer Garner has great on-screen chemistry and Colin Farrell makes a good villain; really enjoyed seeing him in battle with Farrell, action-packed and riveting. The movie is shot in a more realistic and adult-themed approach, versus the fantasy, and at times campy, style of other superhero movies. The overall quality, suspense and intrigue doesn't match those of the Batman and Superman, and the cinematography looked washed-out. But it's still a worthy movie to spend the Sunday afternoon with.

35,thesar-2,The Devil Must've Made Them Do This,2,12 April 2014,"How can a movie with one of the best soundtracks of all time be one of the laziest, least exciting and most incomprehensible Marvel misses since (AND AFTER) Howard the Duck?Ben Affleck's Daredevil, the discount Batman, was so blah and so all over the place it probably should've been a Crank sequel than a Marvel Superhero movie. The editing was shotty, the powers unexplained, the acting bad, the real humor nonexistent and the unintentional humor was the only thing that would get us to the ending.When this movie first came out in February 2003, my initial reaction before I saw it was: Oh, this is not good. If this Superhero movie had any quality, it would be in the summer and notValentine's Day weekend. Nevertheless, I went to go see it for the first and last time that opening weekend.Note: that was my intention, 11 years ago. Until a fantastic podcast, How Did This Get Made, came on my radar, that is. That internet show which ridicules (for the most part) bad movies for about an hour is so hilarious, I vowed to watch/re-watch all of the movies they cover. Sadly, this was on their list.Actually, let me back up. I said ""sadly,"" but I have wanted to give it a second chance since it originally disappointed me in the theatre. I mean, people seem to go gaga for Benny Affleck and so much so, my dislike for him (from the first moment I saw him) made me doubt myself.Well, doubt no further. He was, as always, horrible in this and the movie was even worse than I remembered. In fact, the much-lower budget, Made-For-TV movie, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk that featured both Daredevil and Hulk was much more entertaining.Basically, we have murderer Daredevil taking many blows while taking justice into his own hands. Eventually, he meets and stalks the unexplained Elektra who can fly all over the place, runs into Bullseye who can toss things with extreme accuracy even though the reasons behind that are nonexistent and finally, he bumps into The Kingpin who is eeeeevil, but only because he tells us so.Oh, and spoiler, Daredevil has no problem killing whomever he pleases, as long as he judged them right in his mind. Why he doesn't kill the most evil of all – again, because they tell us so and not really show us so, the Kingpin, is beyond me.If you are not laughing by or at the Elektra/Daredevil waltz in the playground, you will absolutely be busting a gut with the terrible CGI, the laugh-out-loud ripped-off Matrix climax or when the characters inexplicitly hover/fly all over the place with absolutely no rhyme or reason whatsoever. Again, this movie is VERY LAZY.Not since Student Bodies have I seen a ""Death by Paperclip"" scene. Only, in Student Bodies, it was intentionally hilarious.* * * Final thoughts: Two positives emerged from this movie. One: my love for the soundtrack. It is great and you should buy it. Stay away from the movie, but get the soundtrack. And two: I am a huge Hell's Kitchen fan. The Gordon Ramsey edition, that is and not when they refer to a piece of ""rough neighborhood"" in this movie. At least, I got a smile every time those two words: Hell's Kitchen were spoken.",Daredevil
36,cherold,Underrated but misses greatness,7,1 January 2005,"For some reason this movie has become the brunt of a lot of jokes, I guess just because it didn't make as much money as other superhero movies, which seems to be how things are determined to be good or bad. It's actually quite a decent little movie, much better than any of the other big superhero movies (Spider-man, Batman, The Hulk) except for X-Men, which is still far better.There are some really cool things in Daredevil. It doesn't shy away from the Death Wish nature of vigilantism as other superhero movies do, giving it a darker, grittier quality. The way they indicate DD's heightened senses is very cool and used very nicely, both in fight scenes and in lovely little touches like the umbrella at the funeral scene.At the same time, the movie never completely works. Sometimes it gets really dumb, as in the scene with Electra fighting with all the sand bags (like way too many scenes in the film this done like an MTV video, which is one of the cheapest and most common gimmicks in modern film and something I hope goes away someday). There are also moments where I feel something should have more impact than it did; the movie lacks a certain umph. Action scenes are good but rarely great, and I would say that sums up the movie in general. Still, the fact that in spite of a more sensible and cohesive story than Spider-man it didn't do as well suggests that Hollywood is right in thinking people don't really care about script anyway.",Daredevil

Fluke is a fish, Matt.""",3,1 December 2017,"Blinded as a child when a vat of radioactive goo hits his face, Matt Murdock discovers his other senses have been uber-heightened. As he grows, he trains as a fighter and learns to use his newly found powers to fight for good. That ""good"" includes bringing down Kingpin - the city's biggest crime lord and the man ultimately responsible for the death of his love, Elektra.This was a first time viewing for me. It may not be fair, but watching the 2003 Daredevil film in 2017, it's impossible not to compare it with the Netflix series. Let's see - they both, obviously, feature the blind titular hero. They both feature a ruthless criminal named Kingpin. They both feature a love interest / fighter named Electra. And they both feature a lot of fight scenes. But beyond these superficial similarities, the movie and the series couldn't be more different. Ben Affleck looks horribly stiff - especially in his fight scenes. His movements are unnatural. Michael Clark Duncan might have been a wonderful actor, but like Affleck, he's also stiff - too stiff to be an effective Kingpin. I don't think the weight he gained for the role did him any favors. As bad as Affleck looks in the fight scenes, Jennifer Garner as Elektra is even worse. She looks like someone in an aerobic kickboxing class, not someone who could actually hurt you in a fight. Finally, while both films feature a ton of fighting, the stuff in the movie is child's play in comparison with the brutality displayed in the series. The fight scenes from Netflix's Daredevil are miles better and way more convincing. If all that weren't bad enough, the 2003 movie also features an over- the-top Colin Farrell as Bullseye (and I don't mean over-the-top in a good way like I often do), a duller than dirt screenplay (boring), and a lot of bad CGI (the movie looks horrible). To put it bluntly, the movie stinks. I'm being terribly generous by giving it a 3/10.",Daredevil
38,FeastMode,my notes,7,24 July 2019,"Great movie, has its flaws like some cheesy acting and dialogue, but still very entertaining. i watched the directors cut which is apparently much darker and a more complete movie. it's a full 30 minutes longer. i can't really compare since i last saw it in the theaters when it came out, but this does not deserve all the hate it got. daredevil is such a cool character and this depiction of him was satisfying, even after watching the MCU depiction (4 viewings)",Daredevil
39,Lejink,Fair-devil,6,2 January 2009,"I'm not greatly familiar with Daredevil's comic-character but can obviously see that he's pitched somewhere between the avenging dark-angel of The Batman and the angst-ridden outcast Spider Man not only in traits but also in characteristics. With a lesser budget and weaker cast than either of its multi-million grossing antecedents it's not surprising that it pales in their wake. It's not without some redeeming features in terms of cinematography, stunts and even the attempts at characterisation, but it's all very second-hand especially considering what Christopher Nolan is now doing with The Batman. Unlike the Spidey and Batman movies however this effort seems aimed far too much at a teenage audience, with its more cartooney narrative and dragging along a lumpen teeny-punk soundtrack, obviously to push the related album - its afore-mentioned big brothers succeed by aiming at adults and giving younger viewers credit for the intelligence to appreciate their greater depth. On the positive side, I liked the prologue beginning of the movie, with its recreation of Hell's Kitchen, particularly the father-son relationship (well acted too) although the scene of Matt's bullies' come-uppance is unoriginal in the extreme. I also liked the casual match-throwing reveal of Daredevil's calling card by Urich after his first outing. The issue of the ying/yang duality of vigilante-ism (""I'm not the bad guy"") is at least aired for consideration but not for long as we're soon plunged into another sub-Matrix fight scene to the backdrop of a Gotham-like New York City. The acting is variable, Ben Affleck seeming too lightweight for the tortured avenger of his character and Jennifer Garner is no better than his equal as love-interest Elektra. The villains get to do more, Colin Farrell barely having to change accent as he hams it up as the shillelagh-tossing (I'm joking) Bullseye and Michael Clarke-Duncan as The Kingpin, who changes colour in either a sop to PC or adventurous casting, depending on your point of view. Some of the set-pieces are fine, particularly Bullseye's first encounter with Daredevil which results in the death of Elektra's father) if slightly lacking in true white-knuckle adrenalin, while others fall flat - the first Electra / Matt playground fight in front of a teenage audience and the CGen scamperings of Daredevil up and down buildings over rooftops are poorly executed and most unconvincing. Oh and I'm well tired of film-makers' in-joke nods to the comic creators themselves (Stan Lee even gets a walk-on cameo appearance) - it's now an overused, boring and mildly distracting device. The closing scenes hint at the sequel that didn't happen and I think that's about right. Daredevil on this showing, didn't deserve to ride again.",Daredevil

Sad characters, dark cinematography, expository narration, in medias res, childhood flashbacks, almost constant rain, an instant romance, a fireside love-scene, CG body doubles, interpersonal tragedy, mistaken identity, an unsatisfactory but frequent sex life, fast-paced action, a high-rise apartment, daddy issues, a quirky henchman, a behind-the-scenes boss, dual identities, veiled threats, on-the-nose music, a poorly explained super-power, wonky physics, ""I'm not the bad guy"", a nosy reporter, the best-friend as comic-relief, the Catholic Church, tight leather, flashing lights, the hero jumping off a tall building only to catch themselves at the last moment and various other small, nonsensical efforts at seeming 'cool' make that assessment pretty much spot on. It's mad that the Catholic Church is a cliché of early-2000s movies but here we are. This picture is almost like a twelve-year-old was tasked with creating a superhero film in the vein of 'Spider-Man (2002)' or 'X-Men (2000)' but they decided that they wanted to make it as 'dark', 'gritty' and, generally, just 'edgy' as they could because they'd recently seen 'The Crow (1994)'. Of course, it's not like this is an especially 'mature' piece. In fact, it's far from it. It does, however, have the feel of a faux-'adult' superhero story. It was clearly trying to aim older than its most recent peers, perhaps trying to hit the gap that 'Blade (1998)' and 'Blade II (2002)' left in the market. It's done so poorly that it seems it could only appeal to kids, though. It's stuffed to the brim with all the sickly studio mandates we're sadly now all so familiar with, which results in a narrative that's about as standard as they come. It's just all so obvious. It's all pretty aimless, too. The worst thing is that it's not terrible, as strange as it sounds. Instead, it's simply a coherent but inconsequential experience that does absolutely nothing for you. It neither entertains nor enrages, keeps engaged nor sends to sleep, makes laugh nor makes cringe; it simply exists, leaving you slack-jawed in utter boredom as it unravels. There are three saving graces: Jon Favereau, Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. While they don't necessarily improve the overall flick, you do come to appreciate them, as actors, just that bit more, since they all turn in more-than-decent performances in spite of the material. In the end, Marvel have certainly come a long way. 4/10",Daredevil
41,MLDinTN,Finally a movie with Ben Affleck I don't hate,7,16 February 2003,"(BEWARE OF SPOILERS)
This was a good adaptation of a comic book character, but I still think Spiderman was better.  This film is much darker, and there were hardly any laughs.  And the plot was much better than I thought it would be.  I liked the beginning the best as we get to see how the young Matt lost his sight and what it was like for him when he obtained this superhuman sense of sound.  We even find out he has to lie in a coffin of water just to be able to block out all the sounds and have some peace.
I also liked the scene were Matt meets Electra and he follows her to this park.  There we get to see the 2 go at it in a slightly comical play/fighting bit.  Bullseye is entertaining because he is so crazy. One problem I had was the way Bullseye and Electra could jump around like a superhero because only Daredevil had the superhuman powers. But, they have Electra looking like she came out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Jennifer Garner was good and hated seeing her at the mercy of Bullseye.  She should have survived. Maybe her twin will be in the sequel.
Also Kingpin should have been used more.  He should have done a couple of more evil things, so the audience would hate him even more and give his character more depth because he had few scenes in the movie.  Although, his final encounter with Daredevil was great as we get to see Kingpin's knees broken.
FINAL CREDITS SPOILER: For those that left before the final scene in the closing credits, what you missed was Bullseye in a full body cast in a hospital with a guard outside.  He kills a fly with a syringe and says ""bullseye"".
FINAL VERDICT:  It was good. And remember this is a superhero movie, so don't be like, ""nobody could do that, or jump like that"" since the characters pull off so many unrealistic jumps, throws...  I recommend it for most movie goers.  Only those who like realistic dramas may not think this was any good.",Daredevil
42,g-bodyl,Review of Director's Cut!,8,23 September 2013,"I have never seen the original version of this film and I never planned on it because everyone has been saying horrible things about it. But when I saw that there was a better version in the director's cut, I had to see for myself. Daredevil happens to be a dark, brooding film that came out at a time when superhero movies were all light and fluffy. I liked that because it led to the rise of the dark Christopher Nolan Batman films. This film has some cool villains, a blind superhero with good intentions, and even some wit.Mark Steven Johnson's film is about Matt Murdock who is a blind lawyer fighting for those who are innocent. After a horrid past, he becomes Daredevil at night to fight for the innocent. He targets the Kingpin because of some personal history.The acting is pretty good. Ben Affleck did quite well as Matt and shows he can hold a superhero film. Jennifer Garner does very well as Elektra. Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan make an imposing nemesis duo for Daredevil. Jon Favreau adds some delightful comedy that is needed for such a dark picture.Overall, the director's cut is a great superhero film and I'm sure is way better than the original theatrical release. I enjoyed the action, the fight scenes, and just the movie itself. It led the way for bigger and better things. I rate this film 8/10.",Daredevil

44,CuriosityKilledShawn,Fluff,5,6 May 2004,"Have never read one single Daredevil comic book in my life I guess my review is kind of unbiased. Okay, I am certainly NOT a fan of Ben Affleck but his presence in this film was an indifferent one rather than an aggravating one.
For those of you who are unfamiliar Daredevil is also known as Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer. But though his eyes do not work his other 4 sense do to a superhuman degree. Sounds, smells, touches and tastes go together to form a bizarre sight that has pros and cons over normal vision. It's pretty cool concept and it's reasonably well done.But Daredevil has NO plot! It's a swift 90 minutes of practically nothing. The most involving part of the film is the romance between Affleck and Garner but it's cut short with the arrival of Colin Farrell who plays Bullseye, a paper-thin but funny character. Many have been annoyed at the fact that the Kingpin is played by a Black-American actor. But what does THAT matter? Who cares if he's white in the comic book? Michael Clarke Duncan brings some formidable integrity to the role but does come off as a bit too cuddly at the same time.A tiny bit of story is set up but it's over very soon. I guess the best you could say is that Daredevil doesn't outstay its welcome. But you'll not remember it 5 minutes after seeing it. And I don't like the fact they chose to separate all Daredevil and Spiderman links just because they were licensed to different studios.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a very powerful DTS 5.1 track. Plus a bunch of extras I don't care about.",Daredevil
45,inkblot11,"Be daring and give this film a try, although it is not the best superhero movie out there",6,3 September 2008,"Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) grew up in the Hell's Kitchen section of NYC. His father (David Keith) was a boxing has-been who, nevertheless, encouraged his son to do well in school and go for a law degree. Coming home with a terrific report card, Matt catches his father engaged in a crime and runs away from the scene. However, in his haste, young Matt collides with a truck carrying hazardous waste. Blinded by the incident, Matt discovers that he has, nonetheless, tremendous radar abilities and other special senses. When his father is killed on the streets, he trains himself in the martial arts and goes to law school, also. Now a public defender, Matt sees firsthand that justice is sometimes under-served when the poor are pitted against the rich and the powerful. Therefore, at night, Matt becomes Daredevil, a vigilante superhero trying to knock off the bad elements. His fighting and climbing skills are impressive and he succeeds in his quest. Yet, the city is not happy about his random acts and wants to find out who he is. Also, the nefarious crooks of the Big Apple are not happy, either, as Daredevil is killing them off. They send for the Irish Bullseye (Colin Farrell), a hit-man with sensational knifing skills. Look out, Matt! Then, Matt meets lovely Elektra (Jennifer Garner) at a cafe and he is smitten! He learns soon after that she has impressive martial arts talents, too and that her father is a wealthy man with many connections. With Bulleye out to get Matt, will Elektra and her father be in danger from association? This is a rather violent and uneven adaption of what was most likely a fine comic series. But, any weak qualities the movie sports are not the result of the fine cast. Affleck is very nice as the blind superhero and Garner is most lovely as the fiery little rich girl. As for Farrell, he is a hoot, despite his loathsome persona, and the rest of the cast, including Keith, Jon Favreau and others is wonderful as well. Ccstumes, sets, and special effects are fine, too. Therefore, the impact of the film has been lessened by an average script, an equally average direction, and a penchant for unnecessary violence. Nevertheless, most comic book fans will want to arrange a viewing, as superhero movies are still something special in the world of cinema. Fans of the handsome Affleck or the gorgeous Garner, too, will want to be daring and give it a try.",Daredevil

It seems they once again have slaughtered a good movie into Hollywood sleazy, but I really have no intention to check. Anyway, the movie is much better than 2015 TV series in every way except for casting. I do not claim actors in series to be better actors overall, but they are just more adequate for Daredevil roles. Affleck as Daredevil is a complete disaster, hand in hand with Ellen Pompeo in the almost non-existing role of Karen Page. The rest of them are good, but not nearly as impressive as actors in the TV show, especially Fisk and Foggy. The only exception is Jennifer Garner who is perfect Electra.

With just two weaknesses, Daredevil was an excellent, captivating action film with grown-up dilemmas, great dark cinematography, with some fun bits of humor thrown in. With the exception of the absence of the requisite use of bullet proof glass and the last fighting scene of Electras not allowing her to show near her true potential of martial art talent, this movie didn't have the phony relationship ending, had the harder, darker comic strip feel to it. I haven't read about nor cared about the comic strip so I didn't have to make any comparisons. The action and fighting were mostly great. Daredevils sensory perception on film was different and compelling. It will be interesting with the distributor will release an R-rated version of Daredevil out on DVD. Ben Affleck was great as Matt and Jennifer came across attractive and strong at the same time. Colin Farrell did appear a little on the light side for his character but he himself provided a wicked personality to Bulleye that was intriguing. This was fun movie with a dash of humor that didn't intrude and a good storyline that made sense, an emotional pull between good and evil with a movie that seems to morally redeem itself at the end without becoming some Beverly Hills Cop or Die Hard movie. Eight out of Ten.",Daredevil
48,ironhorse_iv,"This movie is a little devil. It's deserves to rot in hell. I'm sorry, this movie sucks. It could have been better.",5,21 May 2015,"There are so many problems with this film, but one of them, wasn't, because it was gritty and kinda dark. I don't know why some people think, this movie should lighten up. The character of the Daredevil has always been kinda of brooding superhero. Unlike other critics, I don't mind, the gritty approach to comic books adaptation like this. Some of them, honestly, works, like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (2005 to 2012). Still, I can understand, why some critics might hate it. After all, this movie makes the emotional in-depth characters, seek gimmicky, and fake-looking. Though it's certainly not the worst superhero film, out-there, this movie directed by Mark Steven Johnson, lacks vision and nothing is on target. Daredevil's problems lie primarily with its voice over narrative. It tells you, what the story is, rather than show you. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the movie tells you, the story of Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), a blind lawyer, turn costume vigilant, Daredevil. When Matt was kid, he was blinded, by hazardous chemicals that has cause him to have his other senses super-enhanced. He vows to use this skill to take revenge, against Crime boss Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), and his Irish assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrell) for the crimes, they committed against him and the community of Hell's Kitchen. The film is overstuffed with subplots that fans will remember from the comics, like 1999's Guardian Devil, but wasn't clever, enough to use the whole plot. Honestly, the main plot for that comic, would have makes a better plot, then the one, they gave us, here, in this film. This movie lacks character development and surrounds from reduced story-telling. The Director's Cut is so much better than the theatrical release, because it explains, how Daredevil was able to capture Kingpin, after years of him, getting away from the law. It also explain more of the issues, which Matt is going through. It explains, why he is able to kill a man, earlier in the film, but not later. Its sucks, that these scenes were cut. Honestly, if the movie kept the director cut, this movie could have been, a little bit, watchable. Another problem with the film is the acting. Ben Affleck as Daredevil is mediocre. It's not his best performance. Normally, when a good actor takes on a role with a specialized characeristic such as blindness, he or she will research the role by observing the everyday life of a person afflicted with the condition. This wasn't the case, with Ben. He appears to have prepared for this role, by watching Mr. Magoo cartoons. The cross eye goofy look doesn't look right. There wasn't anything, realistic to his performance. Don't get me wrong, I know, Daredevil has super-enhanced sense, but I was really hoping, the blindness would play more like an Achilles heel or Kryptonite to this superhero. He barely had, any weakness. I really hate that the movie says that the chemicals made his other senses, super-enhanced. I would rather, see him train hard, to have this ability. It would show his drive, and show that it's indeed a weakness. There is a lack of consistency in Daredevil's powers. Last time I checked, Daredevil had super-senses not superhuman agility or prowess. I really don't remember, him, having aerial skills to make large jumps. Apparently, every fight scene nowadays must employ wire-work and copy off, the Matrix trilogy (1999 to 2003). I hate the dodgy pointless CGI slow-motion action, they have. I also hate the poorly lit and rapidly editing fight scenes with dated jarring rock song, blaring through it. It doesn't bring anything new to the table. The worst acting in the film has to go to Jennifer Garner as the assassin, Elektra Natchios. She lacked everything, that it is needed for the character, such as the foreign mystique. Her Greek accent is really bad. Her fighting skills is even worst. It's slow and it's way too choreography to be taken, serious. Elektra and Matt's relationship felt random and forced. I didn't like all the stalking and sexual harassment, Matt puts her through. Gees it was too much. I also hate that Daredevil would allow innocent people to die to have sex with her. It's so hero, like. The whole playground fight scene is bit too childish and laughable. The whole playground fight scene is bit too childish and laughable. It's so alarmingly out of tone with the rest of the movie, and makes you wonder why Matt Murdock even bothers having a secret identity if he's just going to expose himself, stupidity, by showing how good, he is, in Kung Fu, in public! It's Matrix caricature. Another over the top cartoon character, was Colin Farrell's Bulleye whom gives a memorable performance. It's not great, but it's stands out, compare to the often boring heroes, this film, has. I have to say, Michael Clark Duncan as Wilson Fisk, the mythic ""Kingpin of Crime,"" was alright. He really was build, for the part. I really glad on how he turned out. There are some fun in-jokes, including appearances from Marvel's Stan Lee, Jon Favreau and onetime Daredevil writer Kevin Smith. Overall: This movie is full of lot of tiresome clichés, jarring music choices, and unrealistic action scenes. I hate that Daredevil seem a mere Batman knock-off, when Daredevil works best as a character study of a superhero. Just watch, the 2015's Netflix TV Series 'Daredevil', instead. It's a lot better than this film. This movie about the Man Without Fear; doesn't know the word, 'justice' and how to serve it. Daredevil was just a mess.",Daredevil

It has great fighting scenes, story, romance, the effects were decent at times and a redemption story, what's not to like for a 2003 superhero movie.I'm not saying this movie should be respected by everyone one but I feel some people are too harsh with this movie.Overall a fun simple movie.What can be learned?

50,Movie Nuttball,Great movie that has it all!,10,29 September 2003,"Minor Spoilers.The following is in My opinion!In My opinion Daredevil is not only one of the best films based on a comic book but also one of the best movies period! The actors that play the main characters I believe that this is the best movie they have been in and they probably will not have excellent roles like this again unless there is a sequel like the people say which I hope is true! Let Me explain what I mean.
Ben Affleck as Daredevil/Matt Murdock - The Murdock character was good. Ben put a lot in it but when he is the Daredevil I was really amazed by his acting. He showed rage, emotion, and pain like he really was!Jennifer Garner as Elektra - She to put some effort in the character especially her fighting skills!Colin Farrell as Bullseye - He put all he could into this excellent villain! With a very good accent, fighting skills, and evil face expressions makes Bullseye seem like a real person!Michael Clarke Duncan as The Kingpin, Wilson Fisk - Is all I can say is that every time the huge man is on screen you see award potential performance!Now as for others stars in the movie David Keith, Joe Pantoliano, Erick Avari, and Kevin Smith were good. The music by Graeme Revell was very good. The action and effects are superb! Daredevil is a great movie! Its dark, it has barely any humor, and the above mentioned cast and action makes this movie arguably better than any comic movie released so far! I can't wait for Mark Steven Johnson's Ghostrider! It would be cool if he would direct the announced movie of Elektra and a sequel to Daredevil! I highly recommend this film to everyone!
Movie Nuttball's note: Keep on watching the end credits for a special scene with none other than Bullseye! It is weird that some of the cast members were also in other films together. Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner were in Pearl Harbor and Michael Clarke Duncan & Erick Avari were in the very misunderstood 2001 version of the Planet of the Apes!",Daredevil

He debuted on the newsstand in late '63 or '64. While an original, his creators at Marvel Comics (Stan Lee & company)did manage to borrow a couple of items to give DD a good overall arsenal of powers and skills to work with.His name was borrowed from a different, earlier Daredevil from another publisher. His weakness of blindness was the feature characteristic of DC's Golden Ager, Dr. Mid Nite. To this we add physical conditioning and fighting prowess, no doubtfully inherited from his father, who was a prize fighter by trade.As an adaption to film, it made the transition much better than most others of this genre and managed to put up a movie which is appealing to all in the audience, be they adult or kid, comic reader or not. Certainly their interpretation of DD's extra radar sense was inspired,particularly in the love scenes.

52,johnnyboyz,"Whilst Dardevil is not a great or even particularly good film, it will satisfy the basics in the genre of noir, romance and action.",5,4 May 2008,"Daredevil is a film that stands on the edge of what makes a good superhero film and what makes a bad superhero film. All the frustrating little conventions and over the top content are in the film such as the level of realism and the underdeveloped characters but there is a certain element of something else that almost pushes the experience over the line and into the realm of the recommendable and respectable. The fact of the matter is that Daredevil is not mere guilty entertainment but it feels as if it knows it is teetering itself dangerously on the edge of being so.The idea to make an orphan out of its protagonist is one that is not fresh but the element of gangster and the minimal theme of noir make it so that we may forgive and forget; if we are fans of those respective sub-genres. I for one am, and instead of turning the character into a one dimensional Superman; Spiderman or Batman that must come to terms with the loss of parents, Matt Murdock (Affleck) must first come to terms with the loss of something else: his sight. This is where the ideas for the superhero work out reasonably well because the superhero is one that cannot rely on brute strength and being 'the man of steel'; nor can he rely on a gimmick superpower such as the utilisation of webbings to cover vast tracks of ground in quick fashion and in order to, ultimately, defeat his enemies. Here, Daredevil must rely on his senses of touch and instinct to see him through the day and to save his life.But then again, it makes you wonder what the character and indeed the film would've been like had Daredevil not been blind. The element of realism and the theory that he must actually train to get good because he is blind rather than rely on brute force or a superpower is substituted for the film's other superheroes; Elektra (Garner) and Bullseye (Farrell). Colin Farrell has proved he can take on an array of subject matter and characterisation such as Tigerland, Phone Booth and now this but his actual character is nothing but a skinhead thug who can defy gravity and manipulate the air and space around him  paperclips, darts, syringes, peanuts  it does not matter to him, nothing is impossible. This insults Daredevil's skills somewhat as he has had to train himself through senses and insight whilst being blind to achieve his skills. There is also the problem that the villain is Irish or more specifically, European. Elektra, apart from being nice to look at, is a whiz with the blades but is pretty useless on the whole.So we know what sort of a superhero Daredevil is and we know his journey through life will follow a revenge narrative path as he climbs a little higher and gets a little closer to his goal; his kill. What I do not know or perhaps do not understand is how Murdock manages to, despite being blind, tell if the traffic lights are red or not and be able to smell the scent of Elektra through a window pane whilst sitting in a café. There are also the reasons for Murdock's chosen sleeping arrangements since Murdock sleeps every night in a coffin-like container filled up with water or at least filled up to a level where he can just about breath. Although the film is not merely a revenge film set in a noir inspired world. You may have the big boss who looks down upon the city with a big smile on his face from the comfort of his hundredth storey window; the hit-man/mercenary character the big boss sends out for and the photographer/journalist who does not take sides but reminds you of Alexander Knox anyway. But no, it's not just that and Daredevil needs credit when it is bold enough to go down an alternate route of romance and love, namely between Elektra and Daredevil himself; the best scene of which takes place on a rooftop when he 'sees' her for the very first time. As a figure of interest and as an object of desire, Elektra does the job but is really a mere female Daredevil must meet, go through the motions with and then suffer a setback with  whatever that may be. Elektra is underdeveloped and the evidence makes itself obvious the time we (and Daredevil) first see her: she walks into the coffee shop in slow motion and flicks back her hair as Murdock sits and his buddy 'Foggy' Nelson (Favreau) stares at her in awe. Then it becomes apparent Elektra has more in common with Murdock than you think: both know their martial arts; both have suffered traumas to do with their parents and both of them like to dress up when they go out to fight but does Elektra's mask of anonymity really warrant an additional little costume? You can tell a male wrote and directed this. From here, the rest of the film is fight scenes and really, really bad rock music. True, the fight scenes are entertaining and have a somewhat added element to them because we know Daredevil is blind and is going up against a character in Bullseye who sort of resembles a cross between a master of Kung-fu and an English football hooligan. The film annoyingly concludes with a scene that blatantly sets up a sequel but what can you do? The film is somewhat fun and energetic and has an air of tragedy within it but just like other films in the genre, do not expect anything great.",Daredevil
53,Rectangular_businessman,Don't believe the hype .,1,20 March 2007,"Did I saw the same movie that all the people who is giving this a lot of praise ? They talk about how wonderful it's the director's cut and how the edition ruined it. That isn't true. It doesn't matter if the uncut version is more violent. It still is pretty bad, because ""Daredevil "" it's just a boring adaptation without any relevance or personality. The script it's dull and tedious,the action scenes are mechanic, dull and seem stolen from better movies like ""Spider -Man "" or ""X-Men"". The development of the characters it's pathetic ,and the character played by Jennifer Garner it's dumb and uninteresting. The performances are incredibly bad.THis movie don't have personality ,soul or style. All it's stolen from other movies and all of it it's poorly made. The only movie of Mark Steven Johnson that I liked was ""Simon Birch"".",Daredevil
54,leplatypus,Born-dead again (DVD),1,13 January 2011,"If « Born again » was another Daredevil's masterpiece from his finest writer Frank Miller, this movie is just an awful adaptation (?), vision (?) of this superhero. That does explain maybe why Frank Miller is killed in his cameo appearance.Here, nothing fits to the legend: New York seems lost in their LA and digital shooting. All the characters have received twisted treatment:Kingpin isn't a powerful and massive threat. Daredevil isn't red; he sleeps in a pool; his super-sense is stupidly depicted: it's so good that he sees under the skin ! Elektra has no past and is skilled with weapons without explanation.Worse, the story reinvents the characters with painful choices: all the tragedy of the love story between Elektra and Daredevil is that she has become a lost soul after the assassination of her father, leading her to step into the dark side and having for mission to kill Matt's friend! Now, it's Daredevil that kills her father and Elektra wants her revenge! Bullshit! If Garner is an athletic casting, she lacks this dark side and Affleck as Daredevil shows as much feelings as a blank page! Farrel 's acting for Bulleye is dreadful.To conclude, as Batman, Daredevil is a dark knight and needs desperately the top of artists to have great stories. This ins't the case here and I wouldn't try either the director's cut as well!",Daredevil
55,TheMovieDiorama,Daredevil is blinded by an overstuffed plot that feels more suited to an Evanescence music video.,3,5 September 2019,"""Devil card, never leave the church without it"". Honest to God, was fully expecting that line, that's the level of cringe we're dealing with here. Prior to this wonderful superhero blockbuster, I had no knowledge of Daredevil aside from his sonar ability. No, I've not seen the Netflix series, and no I hadn't read the comics. I simply just don't care enough. And after watching this, I really really don't care anymore. My refusal to summarise the plot in one sentence is justified, reason being is that the narrative is overstuffed with segregated sub-plots that it feels respectable to tackle them individually. So, here we go!Unequivocally the basis of Sin Cit..., I mean, Daredevil is revolving around a blind wealthy lawyer who takes it upon himself to become a masked vigilante at night and nunchuck civilians to death (*cough* Batman *cough*). It's a tight, cheaply woven PVC gimp suit that provides no protection or added traits whatsoever, and due to the helmet covering up his eyes, Affleck's butt chin is more noticeable than the shoddy CGI. Thank the lord his eyes were covered up though, because Affleck's blind acting was more ""derpy"" than me trying to work out basic mathematics whilst heavily influenced by gin (hint: I look like Affleck).So Matt Murdock, the eponymous character, yearns to annihilate the crime lord Kingpin for committing a crime that had influenced Matt's fight against criminals. Y'know, ""justice is blind"" and all that obvious rubbish that makes you want to heave. Ingenious casting of Clarke Duncan, I must say, just a shame Johnson never flippin' utilised him at all. Same can be said about the assassin Bullseye, with Farrell having a target etched onto his forehead in case we forgot who he was playing, who ""never misses"". The cruel irony is, that he missed atleast fifty seven times. Should've been called the ""Inaccurate Irishman"". Anyway, he's in it for no apparent reason, but Farrell did good with his cocaine fuelled acting.But we're not done yet. Oh no. Half of the film focused on a blossoming romance between Matt and Elektra ""Nachos"", because she wanted guacamole instead of salsa dip if you catch my cold. Yet despite Matt thinking ""hey, I am nacho boyfriend"", his resistance proved futile. And so, as soon as they meet, they battle it out whilst precariously balancing on some seesaws in front of some kids in public. Oh, super basic choreography by the way, was slower than my nan (she can't walk sooo...). But before any of this excitement ensues, Johnson tackles the origin story of Daredevil in the most uninspired fashion by simply doing nothing with it. All of this is just the narrative, I haven't even touched upon the court ruling with Coolio that apparently is exclusively available in the Director's Cut. So much stuff, yet no actual substance. Amazing, really.The action set pieces are plagued with Dutch angles, flashing lighting that will induce epileptics into seizure mode and grungy aesthetics to capitalise on Miller's style. The soundtrack though, oh God the soundtrack! Who knew that playing Evanescence's 'My Immortal' at a funeral would evoke my nostalgic emo phase. And then 'Bring Me To Life' during a training montage? I can't. It's too much.As an album, Daredevil rocks. As a film, it's both blind and deaf. That's narratively blind and emotionally tone deaf. The film wouldn't end and all I wanted was a bowl of nachos whilst I fall asleep watching this snooze-fest.",Daredevil
56,digitalbeachbum,I didn't care for it,1,11 September 2021,"I collected the comics. Daredevil was one of my favorites. This movie doesn't do it justice. The television series was better.I don't like the casting and I do not like the script. I definitely did like the directing. Daredevil is so much more than just a lawyer with special abilities. The movie tries to cram too much in to a 103 minute cut.I don't see Ben Affleck as Daredevil. I don't see Jennifer Garner as Electra. The fight scene in the playground is terrible. The cut scenes and the choreographing is terrible. As goes the entire movie with fight scenes.I think that Michael Duncan as Wilson Fish (Kingpin) is interesting, but Wilson Fisk is white, not black, and supposed to be massive. Michael Duncan doesn't appear to be as big or fat.While Bullseye is cast correctly, the character lacks substance. The history of this character is cut short and they make him out to be insane. He isn't insane, he's a psychopath. There is a difference, crazy vs insane, and the director didn't explain things to Colin Farrell correctly. I don't blame Colin for this portrayal.And what gives Bullseye all his extra powers? They would never bother to explain this? Because he doesn't have all those extra powers. He's only supposed to be an assassin and assassins don't work for the ego or the glory. They like to do things silently and with out being noticed. This character isn't Bullseye either.I think that this is an example of how Hollowood works. They need to make a profit so spend less money and market the heck out of the movie.",Daredevil
57,Vartiainen,Seriously under-appreciated,9,13 July 2012,"This film gets a bad rep from pretty much anyone, which has always amazed me, because in my opinion this is one of the better superhero films out there. It was one of the first Marvel films to feature a rather dark and at times depressing storyline, one where the hero is not guaranteed to win and even if he does, it's a Pyrrhic victory at best. Of course there had been Blade before this one, but aside from that, this was the first one, which I found very refreshing. Aside from that, the character cast fits the mood of the film and the casting is pretty solid, with Colin Farrell absolutely nailing the role of Bullseye. Add in a great and gritty visual style, some solid action scenes and a love interest that actually is able to look after herself - to a certain degree - and I really don't get why this movie hasn't been ranked any higher than it is.Well, okay, one of the reasons is the original cut, which is nowhere near as good as the director's cut. The original is not bad in my opinion either, but the director's cut just flows better and enhances the darker aspects of the story. A shame that the director's vision didn't get a theater release, because it might have saved this film from its mixed reception.And that's my two cents about this film. It's a solid superhero film with a dark atmosphere, great characters and a good storyline. Definitely worth checking out if superhero films are your thing or even if you're just looking for a good action film.",Daredevil

Later we see Matt who is now an attorney and he later meets Elektra(Garner) at a coffee shop with his friend(Jon Faveau from Iron Man)Together he must fight crime and save the world from bullseye(Farrell) and Kingpin(Duncan).

What that would turn me into?! The Cheesy Man?!! They don't spend much time for making that solid as it should be!What were the most beautiful things in this movie?(Elektra) and (Bullseye).Why did (Michael Clarke Duncan) always separate his legs whenever he stood in here?!I think he had dermatitis!Name 5 good movies starring (Ben Affleck)?(Pay Check) was a good one; which I thought it could have been better without him!..And the other 4 movies?!I can't recall any. Because THERE ISN'T!Did you watch this movie in a theater or as a rented video?..I can't watch some movies in the theaters for psychologi.. err.. I mean personal reasons!Did you watch the movie alone or with a friend?Are you kidding me? With a friend of course. It had (Ben Affleck) and (Colin Farrell) together man! So I could've got the (Affleck)'s or the (Farrell)'s syndromes on me suddenly. Although (Farrell) did quite a job, but the doctors told me that I should be patient till I could be capable of watching anything by them without hurting anyone, including myself!(I feel funny, but put a smile on my face and continue..)From your point of view, what were (Ben Affleck)'s feelings when he knew that there would be no Daredevil's sequel, but an Elektra's prequel?!I supposed that he would feel sad and retire from acting for good, or at least get any BETTER. But unfortunately he didn't feel.. He didn't FEEL!(He starts to cry, but suddenly stops, so I say..)What is the connection between (Ben Affleck), (Josh Hartnett), and (Tobey Maguire)?All of them need help, must search for another jab, they make me feel bad about going to the movies, and none of them is super at anything!Hmmm??.. I meant that they all got the chance to be stars before being 30 years old! Anyway, what does (TMVM) stand for?!!(The Most Vexed Man)!And why exactly do you call yourself that?!Well, maybe because there is a lot of ugliness in the world and now in the cinema too. Or that there is a lot of CGI in movies which made me so. Or simply because I've just finished watching THIS ONE!!(Strange sparkle looks in his eyes, I ignore that and ask him cheerfully..)Now answer me by a movie's title.. What did you feel after (Daredevil)?Like ""12 Angry Men""!What do you think about all of this sudden cinematic mania over the old comic superheroes in the 2000s?Well.. ""It's Mad Mad Mad World""!Your final statement ? Is there anything you want to end this interview with?Yes, ""Burn Hollywood Burn""!(.. and he yelled so many scary times, before committing suicide by watching this movie for a second time.

60,thinker1691,""" I did lose my eyesight, but I gained something more important """,9,19 February 2012,"Stan Lee the innovative creator of the Marvel Comics group gave rise to the inspired youth of America. Among the most noted characters were of course the Incredible Hulk, amazing Spiderman, Fantastic Four, X-Men and this one "" Dare Devil.

Growing to become a nimble, agility tumbling lawyer, Murdock also fights crime by becoming the Nemesis of criminals known as the Man-Without-Fear; Daredevil. The movie is loaded with high-flying action-oriented scenes and plenty of physical confrontations with the bad-guys.

61,generationofswine,An Honest Review,7,16 November 2016,"The problem here is that it wasn't exactly dark enough and Daredevil wasn't exactly street enough.But that is without seeing the director's cut.The fact is, they tried for the darkness that people would expect from Daredevil, but still attempted to make it relatively child friendly. It made for an epic fail that only came half-way to what it needed to be.And then there is the street aspect of Daredevil. He isn't the Avengers, he takes on problems in Hell's Kitchen, he operates close to the community and you sort of only got a taste of it.They tried to show that street-wise hero, but ended up making things still a little larger than life. A little too much in that regard. The Kingpin, and Duncan was perfect for the role, seemed like a villain a little too big for Daredevil, a little too removed from the mafia thug that he actually is.As a result, the movie sort of fails, but only just. A little push further in the right direction would have taken it from a failure to a success.It can still be enjoyed, for what it is, but feels hallow.",Daredevil
62,strong-122-478885,"A Blind, Crime-Fighting Superhero!? Gee! What Will They Think Of Next?",4,24 June 2014,"I know this isn't saying much, but I found that about the only really interesting conversation that took place in Daredevil's story (this happened more than a few times) was in regards to all the speculation being made over whether or not there were alligators actually living down inside NYC's sewer system.It's not like I really care, one way or the other, about alligators being down there amongst all of that crap & crud, but that just gives you a pretty good idea of how insufferably dull & dreary the overall rapport was between all of the characters in this total let-down-of-a-movie.Personally, I think that this time around Stan Lee and Bill Everett's conception of the Daredevil character has got to be the absolute dumbest of all their joint superhero creations put together from Marvel Comics' heyday (circa. 1964).Like, c'mon, now - A 12 year-old boy gets seriously splashed in the face with toxic waste and this doesn't kill him, or make him violently ill, or even give him face-cancer!? No. It just blinds him, but this doesn't ruin his life. On the contrary, instead, it heightens his 4 other senses to the extreme (which is a big plus). And as he matures into a man he becomes as agile as an acrobat from the 5th Dimension, or something. (Spare me!) Daredevil's story suffered a further traumatic blow by the unwelcome introduction of Elektra Natchios into all of the crime-fighting action. The icky romance that inevitably transpired between Murdock and this ninja-fighting rich-girl was an ultimate stinkeroo.It also really bugged me, big-time, the way that Murdock kept returning to the church, repeatedly seeking Father Everett's saintly blessing for his crime-fighting goody-goodness.And, finally - Am I really supposed to believe that Murdock, himself, (being blind, and all) actually designed and put together all of his own weapons and costume? And, like, what the heck was with that goddamn over-sized pressure-cooker (?) that Murdock sometimes slept in? Did he design and build that contraption, too!? My-oh-my! So many, many questions. But, as usual, no satisfying, or reasonable answers to be found.",Daredevil
63,ebiros2,Well crafted,6,9 October 2005,"I liked this movie. Story line didn't mess up the continuity with the original comic characters, and plot was pretty carefully crafted to showcase the Daredevil's character. I could see the sincerity director Mark Steven Johnson put into this movie and it was a refreshing departure from the studioed out versions of other Marvel character turned movie where so much is changed from the original that they're almost a new character.This is only my personal desire, but I wished the cinematography was better. Everything was either too green, or blue or just too dark to really bring the characters to light (no pun intended). I also sense that Johnson only drew reference from Frank Miller's version of Daredevil which made the tone so dark, but in the future, if directors are going for sources of inspiration, I'd suggest skipping Miller. I'm against Miller for one thing - spreading anger and cruelty into the art of graphic novels. If you're angry about something, it automatically boosts one's sense of self importance because you're always condemning something or another. It also gives a false sense that subject is a serious matter or the person getting angry is a serious individual. Well, you'll be taken lot more seriously if you just did your job right in a positive way than being angry all the time. It was a cheap out by Miller so that he would contrast sharply to other artists (who are better artist than him).Jon Favreau was spot on as Foggy Nelson. He was great playing this role. Ben Afflack could have been portrayed better if his natural personality was brought up more like he did when he was walking with Elektra. Matt Murdock's character was little thin because it didn't play either on Murdock's character or Ben's character. Villains were not very believable especially the King Pin.I'll add more comments after I see the director's cut that everybody is raving about. If it's as good as they say, Johnson made a good movie even better.",Daredevil
64,dee.reid,Another good spin on a Marvel Comics character,8,9 March 2003,"As a child, young Matt Murdock was blinded when toxic waste struck him in the eyes.  Even without a sense of sight, his remaining four senses have now been amplified to superhuman levels.  With them, he is now able to form a 360 degree ""view"" of his surroundings.  He then uses his newfound abilities to fight crime.  Now an adult, Matt (Ben Affleck) is an attorney in Hell's Kitchen and works with his best friend played by Jon Favreau, who naturally does not know that the man sitting across from him is a vigilante known as Daredevil.  Murdock/Daredevil will eventually have to deal with two villains  Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Bullseye (Colin Farrell).  He does all of this while romancing the beautiful Elektra (Jennifer Garner). 
""Daredevil"" is a very nice spin on yet another Marvel Comics character.  I was not expecting ""Daredevil"" to be a wondrous spectacle like ""Spider-Man"" was last year, but I was expecting something very good.  Ben Affleck is good as the vulnerable Daredevil.  Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell both make excellent villains as Kingpin and Bullseye.  Lastly, Jennifer Garner makes for a great Elektra.The film more closely follows the trail of ""Batman"" than it does ""Spider-Man"".  ""Daredevil"" is dark (not as dark as ""Batman"") and does not have the same mood as ""Spider-Man"" did.  I also understand that `Daredevil' was originally supposed to be a lot more violent and had some nudity in it that got it an ""R"" rating.  I honestly hope that the ""R""-rated version comes out on DVD.8/10",Daredevil
65,MaxBorg89,A quite underrated Marvel Comics adaptation,7,23 March 2007,"Following the success of X-Men and Spider-Man, Daredevil was treated like the ""black sheep"" of the celluloid versions of Stan Lee's comic-books. Much of that criticism was unfair (Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider are less accomplished, in my opinion), and Mark Steven Johnson's treatment of Marvel's blind hero is more than worthy of a re-evaluation.The character himself is already quite unique in the comic-book universe: unlike others, Matt Murdock was brought up in a pretty violent neighborhood, living alone with his dad, an unemployed boxer. Subsequently, he lost his sight permanently after being exposed to toxic substances, although those same substances enhanced his other four senses at the same time, giving him a sort of ""radar"". In pure superhero tradition, the first twenty minutes of the movie show the protagonist getting acquainted with his new abilities, which he will need to use well once his old man gets killed for refusing to cooperate with gangsters.At this point, we're introduced to the real story, focusing on the double life of Murdock (Ben Affleck): lawyer by day (giving a whole new meaning to the phrase ""justice is blind""), vigilante by night. Between these two activities, he finds time to chat and make jokes with his partner, Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson (Jon Favreau), and also to get ""friendly"" with the intriguing, and lethal, Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), whose father is an associate of Wilson Fisk, aka the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), the unofficial crime lord of the city. Also worth mentioning is Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano), the only reporter around who thinks there's some truth to the urban legends surrounding a certain ""Daredevil"". Oh, and let's not forget Bullseye (Colin Farrell), Kingpin's henchman, known for never missing his target.Most of these characters were used prominently in Frank Miller's Daredevil cycle (some of his most memorable images are recreated shot-for-shot, à la Sin City), and the movie deserves praise for retaining the dark mood of the comic-book, instead of attempting a lighter approach (anyone who has seen Joel Schumacher's Batman films knows how that usually ends), which could have ruined the characters. In fact, the main protest from critics and viewers was regarding a bunch of scenes whose tone didn't fit into the picture. Now, I didn't have any major problems with a Matt/Elektra love scene, which was quite well executed (although it does look like a Spider-Man rip-off), whereas the infamous confession booth sequence did bother me as it felt out of place given the character involved. Anyway, those two scenes were removed in the Director's Cut; the most ridiculous bit, however, wasn't: I'm talking about an overblown scene featuring the two protagonists, a playground and lots of kicking. That sequence just doesn't work for two reasons: a) it makes the hero look puerile, and that's the last characteristic you associate with Daredevil; b) why would a blind man do a Matrix impression in front of a group of kids? How's that for protecting your secret identity, huh?Generally, though, the film works admirably, thanks to Johnson's respect for the source material and the layered, believable performances: Affleck, a long-time fan of the comic-book, convinces both as the blind attorney (well, except for the playground scene) and his alter ego; Garner manages to make Elektra's transformation from innocent girl to assassin fairly (considering the context) realistic; as for the supporting players, Favreau nails Foggy's comedic energy at once, while Farrell and, especially, the towering Duncan inhabit their characters with so much ease audiences shouldn't care about the fact that they look different in the comics.Sure, this isn't Spider-Man or X-Men, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Daredevil may not be to everyone's taste (it is, after all, based on one of Marvel's more adult comic-books), but it remains an interesting, totally watchable blockbuster.",Daredevil
66,Fluke_Skywalker,The Man Without Cheer,5,19 May 2015,"'Daredevil' has got a cast of actors who have all done good work, just not here (save for perhaps Michael Clarke Duncan, who does as much as is humanly possible with his ridiculously underdeveloped villain). And though I did like the visual interpretation of Matt/Daredevil's sonar sight, the wire-work aided fight scenes are clumsy and unexciting. Mix in a ham-fisted origin, a bare bones plot and a bad soundtrack and this Daredevil is more like The Man Without Cheer.I've heard the director's cut is supposed to be superior, and indeed the theatrical version does play as if it were edited with a weed whacker, but I'm just not sure the basic raw material is there to begin with.",Daredevil

I think I was even pleasantly surprised by how not that bad it was. Anyways low expectations here made for an alright viewing.The film looks good, broody and dark and I enjoyed the origins section where we meet a young Matthew Murdock and his down and out former prizefighter father (David Keith)-this part was well put together showing us how he got blinded by some strange ""radioactive liquid"" and then as his other senses were heightened the city become his playground.Ben Affleck does a decent enough job as the blind lawyer turned superhero, taking on the likes of Kingpin and Bullseye to avenge the death of his father while also falling for the beautiful Elektra (Jennifer Garner) -who is gorgeous here. Garner and Ben have sizzling chemistry together especially their fight scenes which felt more like foreplay and I liked how he ""saw"" her in the rain.Kingpin is played by the lovely Michael Clarke Duncan who unfortunately does little more than stand around and pose in good suits for the majority of the movie. I did enjoy Colin Farrell as the assassin Bullseye; a fun character able to hurl items (paperclips, darts, cards, glass shards) with deadly aim and just the right amount of c-c-c-crazy.Somehow though Daredevil never felt like a real superhero to me, just a poor version of Batman, lurking on rooftops and often reminded me of Spiderman too as he swings and jumps from building to building -which I wondered about, how does being radioactively blind make you able to leap about as if you can fly? Probably better not to think about these things. 9/21/15",Daredevil

""DEADPOOL"" as that was terrible it was a trying to hard to be a comedy-spoof & was horrendous). The epic & brutal end fight between ""DD"" & KingPin was fantastic, ""DD"" slides under him & kicks his knees inwards & snaps his legs, that was AMAZING & very brutal, we wouldn't see that today!!!!
The fight scenes are excellent & done with a dark sense of realism, i would've love a sequel to Daredevil.
Another amazing bit of this film is Daredevils costume, it's Amazing i absolutely love his blood red tough biker leather costume!!!
Daredevil has never looked better, even the Netflix show wasn't as great looking as Daredevil in this movie.DAREDEVIL is a true cult classic, an excellent underrated & unappreciated true graphic novel put on film!!! Excellent movie making & one of the best superhero films of all time in my opinion.
""DD"" is grimy-gritty with excellent cinematography of the night time world that he stalks looking for thugs & gangsters, this really is such an underrated movie but i will admit the ""Directors Cut"" is way better than the theatrical release, it has an extra 30 mins with a little sub plot added in & it actually does add much more to the whole story & world of DD!!!
One of the most underrated MARVEL film of all time along with other greats 2004's ""The Punisher"" & 2003's ""Hulk"" all excellent adult ""Super hero films"" & all extremely underrated & stupidly hated on?
I never listen to critics anyway!!! Just like what you like.",Daredevil
70,noralee,Mindless Wham Bang Fun,5,28 October 2005,"""Dare Devil"" is no ""Spider Man"" but it's still fun. I like that it's in a somewhat real New York City, and my Queens audience appreciated comments such as comparing the fashions of Hell's Kitchen to Chelsea and that the Kingpin is from the Bronx. Even the subway station shown was correct geographically with the correct train nomenclature. The gaggle of New York-sounding actors also helped, including guys from ""The Sopranos."" We see a real New York Post because Rupert Murdoch owns the paper and the movie studio.Jennifer Garner of ""Alias"" makes stiff, expressionless Ben Affleck look better, though his spiky anime hair helps too. Especially in the rain, that is once again a means for sweet romantic scenes, here shown through sonar. Colin Farrell is once again following Russell Crowe's footsteps, just as Crowe did a villain in ""Virtuousity,"" here literally chewing the scenery in his turn as ""Bullseye,"" (which I assume was rewritten from the comic books to let him be Irish). The special effects are wham bang fun. The soundtrack is coldly calculated to appeal to the movie's primary target audience of 14 year old boys, but manages to be entertaining, though not particularly creative in its loud selections. The sound editing neatly reflects Dare Devil's heightened sense.That this movie made PG-13 when so many foreign and indie movies don't is ridiculous as this is very violent. Stay through the credits as there's a humorous follow-up scene stuck in.(originally written 2/17/2003)",Daredevil
71,hu675,The Director's Cut improves on the original theatrical release and it is much more personal movie.,8,22 September 2007,"Matt Murdock (Scott Terra) is a young boy that grows up on Hell's Kitchen ""Which it's now Clinton!"" and he loves his tough washed-up boxer father (David Keith). Matt went blind after losing his eyes in a hazardous waste. After getting that toxic douses, he has supernatural senses. When his father is murder by a mysterious gangsters. Matt vows revenge for those are responsible for killing his father and becoming an masked avenger. As a adult, Matt (Oscar-Winner:Ben Affleck) lives an life as a respected criminal attorney by day and vigilante hero by night know as Daredevil. The City is changing, when an crime lord known as The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) is trying to eliminated his competitors by hiring an top assassin known as Bullseye (Colin Farrell). A cold blooded killer, who's aims extremely well and never misses. While Matt/Daredevil is falling in love with an mysterious beautiful woman named Elektra (Jennifer Garner). He tries to have an relationship with her, while he's fighting crime in the city.Directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Ghost Rider, Simon Birch) made an entertaining, familiar but dark super-hero movie. Which is Based on a Comic Book Created by Marvel Comics. Affleck is surprisingly effective as the tormented hero. This film is well cast including actors like:Jon Favreau, Joe Pantoliano, Leland Orser and Derrick O'Connor. The original theatrical version lacked some character development, especially the lead villain played well by Duncan and important subplot was cut for PG-13 version. As well for the fight sequences and language was sightly towed down. Now this version is much more darker film with plenty of interesting scenes added back into the movie with rapper Coolio as an man accused of murder (Which he's defending by Murdock and his partner), Jude Ciccolella as a corrupted police detective and Kevin Spirtas (Who's best known as the male lead in ""Friday the 13th Part 7:The New Blood"") as Prosecutor at the trail.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1). DVD also includes an reveling and humorous dead-pan audio commentary by the director and producer Avi Arad (Spiderman Trilogy, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man). DVD also an interesting featurette of why the scenes were cut before theatrical release and deleted some scenes for the Director's Cut. Some might prefer the theatrical cut for an faster action-paced movie but Director's Cut adds so much by extending fight sequences, an additional subplot, more character development and making The Kingpin an much more ruthless villain in this R-Rated Director's Cut. But Farrell still steals the show in his wildly funny Over the Top performance. Watch for Kevin Smith, Kane Hodder, Robert Ller, Frank Miller and Stan Lee in amusing cameos. Screenplay by the director. Super 35. (****/*****).",Daredevil
72,Agent10,"Should have been ""Dulldevil""",4,12 February 2003,"Every once in a while, an incredibly lame movie is released, yet magically rakes in 100 million in the box even though it has a bad script, a terrible lead actor, and rather listless action. This movie is Daredevil.The current renaissance of turning comic books into movies has taken a turn for the worse (as if it was ever on the right track) with this sad collection of images made out to be daring and exciting, yet is remarkably typical of ""straight-to-video"" movies. I half expected someone like Ja Rule or Jean-Claude Van Damme to pop into this movie as some cameo performer. Which reminds me, how could a movie like this lack so much character depth? I see plenty of actors in the credits, but it felt remarkably empty and devoid of anyone but Ben Affleck. I see the likes of Joey Pants and Jennifer Garner in the credits, but they are mostly hyped, not seen. I mean, it was like the first ten minutes of ""Mission Impossible"" where all of the supporting characters are killed off in the first ten minutes. The only difference: the producers managed to stretch out that limited life span through the space of an entire movie. I was even disappointed in Leland Orser, who manages to steal every scene in most of his films, who pulled one of the most invisible performances in a movie full of them.And did Colin Farrell shoot all of his scenes in one day? How long did it take to film this movie? 20 days? 30? This film was so shoddily put together, one has to wonder if they went any further than the first take. Not even the music could save this movie. The soundtrack was subpar at best, and the collection of ""pseudo-hip"" hard rock songs and pop beats were so out of place in this film, it was like someone was trying to mix and match for the fun of it. This film was like a bad rewrite, only they decided to run with it. Yet sadly, producers, critics, and hundreds of IMDB users will most likely see brilliance in this cluttered and mishapen pile of film and sound effects.",Daredevil
73,rbverhoef,Nice villains,6,1 August 2003,"In Europe we were familiar with 'X-Men' and 'Spider-Man' before there were movies from these action heroes. 'Daredevil' is almost unknown and for that reason I didn't look forward to see this movie as much as I did with 'X-Men', 'Spider-Man' and 'X2'. Now I have seen it I have to say I liked it, but not as much as I liked the three mentioned above.Movies about this kind of super heroes all have a couple of things in common: talents we normally don't see with normal human beings, well choreographed fight sequences, one or more beautiful ladies and interesting villains. In the villain section the four 'Batman'-movies still win, although especially 'Batman & Robin' was terrible. The Joker, The Riddler and Mr. Freeze are more memorable than any other I can think of. May be it is because of the actor (Jack Nicholson, Jim Carrey, Arnold Schwarzenegger), may be it is the villain itself. 'Superman' has probably the best super powers although 'Spider-Man' makes it look better. For the fight sequences I have to go for 'Spider-Man' or the 'X-Men'-movies. 'Daredevil' (with Ben Affleck as Daredevil) wins one of those things: absolutely without a doubt the most beautiful lady (yes, I know, it is just an opinion). Rebecca Romijn or Famke Janssen in 'X-Men were fine, Jennifer Connelly in 'Hulk' was very fine, but Jennifer Garner here is perfect.The action is pretty good, the story is familiar but what does it matter, and at least one of the two villains is memorable. Colin Farrell as Bullseye is pure evil and that is the way the villains should be. Don't expect too much and you will certainly have a good time.",Daredevil

75,rosscinema,MTV style ruins film,4,20 February 2003,"I didn't know much about the comic book but I know a badly made film that is geared towards juvenile action fans. I enjoy action films as much as the next guy but this film seemed to need another director. Let me point out what I thought ruined this film. The editing is in the MTV mode and is so sharply cut that some of the action scenes are to difficult to watch as they fly by. If you blink you could miss the whole scene! Its that quickly edited. In a scene where Ben Affleck is in the shower after a tough fight he pulls out a tooth that has been knocked out and throws it at the shower drain. In the next shot he's sipping coffee and showing all his pearly whites! The music is too loud and obnoxious. Its just blaring out very loudly during most of the film and its just overbearing. With all the hard rock music blaring out I kept expecting ""The Crow"" to show up. And my biggest gripe is Jennifer Garner's and Colin Farrell's characters. I understand Daredevil has special powers and can leap and jump from building to building but why are the other two characters able to do it??? Garner's Elektra jumps down like a hundred feet to another building and Bullseye climbs and jumps like they have super powers! Do they have special powers? Or is the director thinking that it worked in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" so it'll work here also. The things that I did like was the effects of how Daredevil can make out images in rain or smoke. I found these scenes very effective. And Jennifer Garner has real screen presence. She's so beautiful, easily one of the most beautiful actress's in the world. She makes an easy transition to the screen. So I was really irritated by the MTV editing, obnoxious music and some bad continuity. They're are a few other things I didn't like as well but these are the main problems. A misfire!",Daredevil
76,invisibleunicornninja,Rose Blood,2,25 April 2018,"Before I start my review, I'm just going to explain how I watched this movie. On YouTube, there is a YouTuber by the username ""YourMovieSucksDOTorg"" and he made a video commentary for the Director's Cut version of this terrible, terrible movie. I watched the movie while listening to this commentary, and it was absolutely hilarious. If you for some reason decide to watch this movie, watch the director's cut alongside the YMS commentary because it is extremely entertaining. Plot - Over two thirds of this movie is a random nonsensical flashback. This movie is poorly written and makes no sense. I just finished watching the movie, and I could not tell you what happened. Characters - The characters are extremely poorly written. At no point did I care about any of them, or understand anything that they were trying to do beyond random guesses. Sights - I don't think that I've ever seen a movie with editing so bad. Whoever edited this movie had absolutely no clue what they were doing. There are way to many cross-dissolves of sped-up shots of skylines. Whoever was behind the camera also clearly had no clue what they were doing. This movie looks terrible. The cinematography is atrocious. Sounds - For some reason the sound design is a mess. There are a lot of random cartoony sound effects and bad sound editing. You'd think a movie with a blind character with undefined powers as the main character (I'm assuming cause his name is the title) would pay close attention to how the movie sounds. The soundtrack is really odd as well. Some songs are good, some are terrible, but most of them don't fit what's happening in the movie. I have seen that stupid scene where Elektra slices up the sandbags in so many reviews, and in none of them did they ever mention that ""Wake Me Up Inside"" was blaring over top of the cartoon slicing sound effects. Action - The action scenes in this movie are hilariously incompetent. This movie is such a mess. Not a single thing is done right. I would call this movie so-bad-that-its-good, but it actually gets a bit too boring for me to recommend it to be watched in that way.If you are going to watch this movie, I'd recommend looking up the YMS commentary track. I would provide a link, but it got removed when the review published.",Daredevil
77,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Entertaining but it struggles to compel,7,1 August 2013,"Blade (1998) has the credits to say it was the first successful Marvel antihero film, but that was based more on the popularity of Wesley Snipes. This however, would be the next successful (financially at least) Marvel antihero film with popularity rudimented solely on its character itself. And of course, because many people wanted to see what this film would be like based off of their opinions from Spider-Man (2002), Blade (1998), Blade II (2002) and X-Men (2000), which received critical acclaim for unique adaptations. Unfortunately, not many people came out of the theaters too thrilled if at all, having mixed feelings about it.The character of Daredevil is about a troubled soul named Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) who gains supernatural powers after having an accident with biohazard waste material. This accident ends up blinding him, while simultaneously enhancing his other senses and allowing him to ""see"" where he is, even though his eyesight is shot. Along with that, he draws inspiration from his father who had the boxing nickname title of Jack ""the devil"" Murdock and becomes the crime-fighting Daredevil. Sticking to its source material, Wilson Fisk aka The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and even Elektra (Jennifer Garner) all have roles in this movie as well, which is appreciated.Trouble is, fans were split on the whole leather aspect of the movie. Quite frankly, it wasn't that distracting. If there was one thing I don't think fit the bill, it was Colin Farrell dressing up to be Bullseye like he was some alley street punk. Oh and Elektra's headband. That's about it for character design flaws. Affleck as Daredevil though was well performed. He's always surprising everyone of how he's blind but knows where everything is. Garner as Elektra definitely no doubt has the moves of action material and being attractive at the same time. Farrell as Bullseye is comical in the sense of how he gets frustrated when he misses his targets. Well of course if you're on a winning streak any one would get mad. Duncan as Fisk was a nice choice too. He's certainly husky enough as well as his booming heavy voice to boot.However, what really eats away at these performances here is Mark Steven Johnson's writing. Johnson seems to have an affinity for love interest subplots, which is exactly what happens here between Daredevil and Elektra. This is what is believed to hold up the story of Johnson's mixed reviewed Ghost Rider (2007) as well between Johnny Blaze and Roxanne. Plus, it's not easy writing and directing simultaneously, and I think after this film, Johnson should have seen that he needed a writer and found a writer to cover Ghost Rider (2007). The feel that I get from this movie is that the relationship felt forced or rushed. It just felt too soon to happen and it sidetracked my attention from the action. One thing I do credit Johnson for writing is how Murdock struggles with himself to figure out if what he's doing is right, and if he should continue his crusade. This shows that Murdock is still human even though he has special abilities. Speaking of action though, the action sequences were well staged. Comparing that to the action Ghost Rider (2007) had – it was much more frequent and even some of the scenes were fairly brutal. Impalings, broken joints and severed body parts - that's more realistic than fantasy violence if you ask me. It could almost be bordering ""Marvel Knights"" status with this kind of violence, which is what the next Daredevil film should be under if fans want a dark and gritty tone. Sadly, this wasn't accentuated enough with the film score provided by Graeme Revell. Revell's score is productive by making a thumping theme for the title character and even a softer motif for the relationship between Elektra and Daredevil, but anything else is generic and uninspired music. It also doesn't help that half the time, soundtrack music from pop culture was used in between as filler. Not needed. In the long run, it is still worth a look though.This Marvel antihero film has some fairly strong action and a good cast. However, its writing struggles to compel with an obligatory love interest subplot and poor music placement throughout the running time.",Daredevil
78,Rob_Taylor,Nothing to write home about,6,7 August 2003,"This film is probably best watched as a bit of a laugh. You can never take films about super-heroes too seriously, of course, but they still have to maintain a coherence and obey certain laws of reality in order to prevent them becoming farcical.Daredevil manages this, but only just. I have to confess to never being a comic book fan as a kid (or adult, for that matter), so some of my comments herein are based solely on what I learned about the character from watching this film. For instance, I can buy that DD has super senses and amazing reactions/reflexes due to his accident. But how on Earth does that allow him to leap from the top of buildings and not get hurt when he lands?As for the plot.....they wisely stuck with a simple revenge story rather than trying to art it up as in the Hulk as something more than it was. This works for the film as you are not trying to puzzle out what the hell is going on and why the character does what he does. A plus for the film.The special effects work reasonably well, though there are some ""look at me! I'm CGI!"" scenes that had me snorting in amusement. Overall though, not bad and the dark look of the film helps in that department too.Even DD's helmet/skullcap thing was only amusing the first time I saw it. Again, not sure how true to the comics it is, but those ""horns"" looked more than a little foolish. In fact, the whole effect gave DD the ""novelty condom"" look, which I'm sure was not intended. A minor niggle, but worth mentioning.Now my real complaint.....Ben Affleck. He tries hard and gives a good performance but somehow I wasn't convinced by him in the role Daredvil. I can't put my finger on it, but it just doesn't seem to suit him. It would be only slightly more odd to see Hugh Grant as Daredevil! Come to think of it, I didn't really like Ben in Sum of All Fears either, though he was good in Dogma and even Phantoms. I guess he just needs to find his niche.Also irritating is Colin Farrel as Bullseye. He was OK in Minority Report, but here he just grates on your nerves. Perhaps that was the intention, but it was still a relief when he gets his just deserts.All in all, this movie is far from the worst superhero movie to date, but it is also far from the best.",Daredevil
79,WeAreLive,"Dark, Gritty and boring",6,4 November 2017,"I saw this movie before my summer holidays finished and boy this movie was just bad.The acting, however, was good but I just found the actual movie just boring and uninteresting.The movie just kicks off straight away in the fight scene before his fight with The Kingpin or rather Bullseye. The film is just bazaar because Matt Murdock's dad get's killed, Bullseye kills Electraza's dad but Daredevil gets the blame, but bullseye kills her too. But the film is cleaver on some parts like in the final fight. Ben Affleck was good as Daredevil but he is in his right shoes now as Batman and Micheal Clarke Duncan RIP he was good as well as Kingpin.",Daredevil
80,brando647,Good effort for Comic Book Movie,7,7 May 2005,"The only Daredevil comic I have ever owned was given to me by my elementary school, in which Daredevil teaches the importance of being careful around flammable gas fumes. Needless to say, I was uneducated about the character's history before I saw this movie. Being a major fan of comic book movies, I decided to check this one out, despite what the critics said.I wasn't entirely disappointed. It dragged at points, but overall I found this movie to be entertaining. It centers on the character of Matt Murdock, a struggling blind lawyer in Hell's Kitchen. When night falls, he takes on the persona of Daredevil, a crime fighter aided with heightened senses and agility. This movie was a bit darker than previous Marvel movies (""Spider-man"", ""X-Men"", etc.) and I think it worked out well. One of the coolest parts of the movie comes in the form of Daredevil's vision, a form of sonar. One of the major problems I had with this movie is that there were a lot of times it felt like it was pushing its soundtrack down my throat. It felt like it would give us a sample of what we could find on the CD when the music would rise up every ten to fifteen minutes, drowning out other sound.The film had a strong cast backing it up. Despite what others say, I think Ben Affleck gave a good performance as Murdock, although I don't really see him as action hero material. I thought Jennifer Garner was a bit weak in her role of Elektra Natchios, her acting seemed stiff at some points. The best work came from the villains. Michael Clarke Duncan (Kingpin) was a helluva presence and Colin Farrell (Bullseye)was demented.""Daredevil"" is not the greatest Marvel movie out there, but it isn't the worst either. Come to think of it, I think I still have that Daredevil comic book buried in my closet somewhere.",Daredevil
81,moviewizguy,One of the Best Superhero Films Ever!,7,23 April 2006,"Fate deals young orphan Matt Murdock a strange hand when he is doused with hazardous waste. The accident leaves Matt blind but also gives him a heightened ""radar sense"" that allows him to ""see"" far better than any man. Years later Murdock has grown into a man and becomes a respected criminal attorney. But after he's done his ""day job"" Matt takes on a secret identity as ""The Man Without Fear,"" Daredevil, the masked avenger that patrols the neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen and New York City to combat the injustice that he cannot tackle in the courtroom.Is this a good superhero film? Yes. Am I a fan of this superhero? No. In fact, I never heard of him until the movie was made. Unlike the family friendly ""Spider-Man"" movie, Daredevil is the opposite. It's dark, like ""Batman Begins"", and has its funny moments. This is one of some films that are really great.The action sequences are fantastic. The fight scenes are choreographed well and the CGI seamless. There is a wonderful cinematography throughout each scenes, including the fight scenes, which gives the whole movie an original look. Even some scenes were incredibly beautiful to look at.The direction from the director, Mark Steven Johnson, is really great. And Ben Affleck plays a charismatic man in the morning and one smart superhero at night. Jennifer Garner also gives us a great performance in her role. And you can't deny Affleck and Garner has great chemistry together as lovers. Michael Clarke Duncan as a villain is, I suppose, decent, while Colin Farrell was really kick-ass.Sure, this isn't a brilliant superhero film but it is a really great one. It's arguably one of the best, in my opinion, though some might hate it. The action is fantastic, the CGI seamless, and the cinematography wicked. If you watch this film, there's a chance you might like it or not, obviously. I am one of the people who thought this film was lovely and found this truly underrated.",Daredevil
82,bkrauser-81-311064,A Superhero Film Positively Affleck-ted,6,6 February 2014,"From the director of Grumpy Old Men (1993), starring the guy who would go on to direct Argo (2012) and including the guy who directed Iron Man (2008), Daredevil (2003) is very much a movie of could haves and almosts. Much like the oft scorned Catwoman (2004) and the goofy but good-natured Fantastic Four (2005), Ben Affleck's red leathered superhero suffers from a studio system not yet convinced of the viability of superhero films but still in the business of making money.Affleck is Matt Murdock a trial lawyer by day and a masked vigilante by night. While still in grade school, Murdock was blinded by an accident involving toxic chemicals. While unable to see like you or I, he develops heightened senses including sonar-type hearing that helps him hunt for lowlifes and thugs. The thug Daredevil most wants to put an end to is the aptly named Kingpin aka Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan), who runs the criminal syndicate in not-Batman's neighborhood and huge swath of the city.﻿Also in the mix is Colin Farrell playing a goofily dressed assassin, Joe Pantoliano as a New York Post reporter and débutante Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) whose billionaire father (Erick Avari) has some shady business dealing with Kingpin he isn't too proud of. A skilled fighter herself, she gets in on the action while simultaneously forming a bond with Matt.﻿Thus comes the part fan-boys seem the most fussy about, the love story. In this writer's opinion, the romance was laudable if flat and one-dimensional. The problem comes when a B-story of such flaccid ordinariness becomes a larger focus than the capes and masks that inhabit the world of Daredevil. Just because both the lovers are semi-superheroes, it doesn't make the romance any more interesting. You need more than schoolyard acrobatics, you need fun characters, good chemistry and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was written by a gifted teenager.Though for me, the reason this film is ultimately placed in the bargain bin Daredevil-Elektra (2005) two-pack is because of it's ""been there, done that,"" quality. Most of the inspirational moments in the movie are lifted from greater superhero films like Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002). Anything original is done sloppily which includes some laughable physics from Colin Farrell's Bulleye character. There's really only one creative scene that doesn't feel like déjà vu; when Matt kisses Elektra in the rain so the droplets can create a consistent image of her face for him. It was romantic, inventive and genuine.Daredevil ultimately fails because it attempts to tell a dark tale that isn't dark enough, a romance that isn't romantic enough and a hero story that isn't heroic enough. All the ideas in it are unoriginal retreads from other films and the direction is too rudimentary to really be mentioned. While doing background for this review I became privy to a director's cut version of the film which includes a subplot involving Coolio. Detractors have been silenced by this new version so I'm slightly curious as to its allure. Curious, but not curious enough to watch the guy from Mallrats (1995) and the third billed starlet from Juno (2007); get silly on a seesaw again.",Daredevil
83,Lady_Targaryen,Justice is blind. So is he.,7,2 November 2005,"Daredevil is a great movie. Analyzing it without reading the comics, I think it is really great and with a cool story.Compared to the comics,some stuff changed from Elektra's look (who has black straight hair,to start)to The Kingpin; but I guess the conclusion was very nice though. For the big fans, I know it must be disappointing,but I guess you guys need to watch the movies and read the comics as separated things. ( I know how is to be disappointed; I never enjoyed very much Harry Potter's movies compared to the books, and I feel the same about Lord of the Rings and Queen of Damned). I liked all the lead actors, Ben Affleck as Daredevil,Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urich,Michael Clarke as Wilson Fisk/Kingpin,Jennifer Garner as Elektra and Colin Farrel as Bullseye. This last one I was surprised by his acting in Daredevil: he is very convincing as a villain, sooo different from Alexander!(I hated Alexander with all my strength).",Daredevil
84,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Daredevil"" (Director's Cut)- While a bit too tame and obviously the product of its time, the film is still quite entertaining and worth giving a second look.",8,5 May 2017,"I want to address something important. I am writing this in response to the extended Director's Cut of 2003's superhero release ""Daredevil."" The version of the film that I view as the definitive release of director Mark Steven Johnson's vision for the character. With a significantly longer run-time, the reinstatement of several key sequences and a somewhat darker and more appropriate tonality, it's by far the preferred method for viewing this film, and I think I would be doing the work a disservice to write this based on the somewhat butchered theatrical version.2003's ""Daredevil"" has seemingly become a forgotten film as of late. Coming out on the heels of the beloved ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" film debuts, the movie was something of a aberration. It never attained the high critical praise or warm fan reception of its peers. It was viewed as a mere cash-grab. A trendy film made to capitalize on the success of other comic-book adaptations. And ultimately as a failure to meet potential. I remember being in High School when it came out, and it was basically completely ignored, save for us weirdos, goths and outcasts who liked it for our own reasons. It wasn't really until the later release of the Director's Cut, however, that we got a glimpse of the potential the film had beneath the surface.Ben Affleck stars as blind lawyer Matt Murdock, who lost his sight in a childhood accident involving toxic waste, but gained superhuman ""sonar"" and reflexes as a result. After losing his father to organized crime as a child, Murdock has sworn to use his abilities to defend the people of New York from the dark criminal underworld, and has taken on the moniker of the ""Daredevil"" to wage this war. The story revolves around a web of treachery as Matt meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), only to find his alter-ego falsely blamed for the murder of her father by criminal mastermind Wilson Fisk. (Michael Clarke Duncan) Murdock must try to stop Fisk's vile plans while also juggling his complicated relationship with Elektra- who now plans on hunting down and killing Daredevil to avenge her father.There's something disheartening about the animosity towards the film felt by many involved. Particular star Affleck, who has negatively addressed the film in the past. Because despite some very obvious flaws, there's actually quite a bit to admire here, and it does manage to entertain on a fairly consistent basis. While perhaps not ideally cast, I felt all involved did admirable jobs with their roles, and Affleck and Garner do light up the screen, especially when they are together. And the villains of the film, portrayed by Duncan with Colin Farrell also starring as the delightfully over-the-top hired thug ""Bullseye"", are just deliciously vile and the sort you just love to hate. They chew the scenery... but they chew it in all the best ways.The film's tone is fascinating and I admired director Johnson's visual sensibilities. He strikes a good balance that mixes realism with stylization- with the film often feeling like a comic book come to life with rich colors and some gorgeous sweeping cinematography. The movie occasionally reminded me of the original Tim Burton ""Batman"" in the way it feels both real and unreal at the same time. And though it might seem a bit hokey to some, I quite liked the visual aesthetic and Johnson's vision for translating the comic to the screen. It gave the film character. I also enjoyed the writing for the most part. Johnson's script might lack in-depth character analysis and move at an inconsistent pace, but I do think that the story presented is a very valid one, and he mixes action and intrigue quite well. There's just enough story there to keep you invested in between the stylish action set-pieces. I also really appreciated that he got the origin out of the way very quickly and concisely. It was refreshing seeing an actual ""Daredevil"" adventure rather than a ""Daredevil"" origin.And sue me... I still love soundtrack. It's pure nostalgia for anyone who grew up in that era and the song choices do fit the mood. (If you dug Evanescence in High School like I did, you're in for a treat!) It gives the film a kitchzy ""time capsule"" quality that I enjoy. It's a purely selfish reason to enjoy the film... but I don't care.The failings of the film really do boil down to the fact that the film is comparatively tamer than it ought be, and the fact that despite admitting I liked the soundtrack... other portions of the film feel dated in the worst of ways. While I'm not a huge fan of the comics, ""Daredevil"" seems like a character whose at his best when he is allowed to be darker... more aggressive. And that's something that just wasn't going to quite happen in this film. Despite the extended cut being given an R-rating, the film was clearly made with a PG-13 in mind, and you can feel it bogging down the entire experience, especially with the inclusion of several sillier scenes that seem made just to make the kiddies in the audience laugh. And the film is too obviously an early 2000's release with an over-reliance on shaky CGI and distracting wire-work. It lessens the impact of some very important scenes.Still, I think the Director's Cut is a film that should be given a second chance. It's pros far outweigh the cons, and it's ability to entertain with good performances and sharp visuals make up for its more obvious flaws. The Netflix series may be the definitive adaptation... but give this one another shot. You just might find that it's better than you remember. I give it a good 8 out of 10.",Daredevil

86,Terryfan,Actually Wild Action Comic Book Movie,8,17 April 2015,"Yes I know Daredevil has gotten a lot of bad reviews because of why I don't know but I'm one of those movie fans who looks past the junk and see the treasure and if you do that with this movie you will actually find it to be more than what others will have lead you to believe.Daredevil I know is inspired by the comic book of the same name from Marvel Comics and I didn't read any of the comic books before seeing the movie the first time I have heard of Daredevil was in the 2000 Spider-Man video game.Now let's get on to the review.The story begins explaining the origins of Matt Murdock AKA Daredevil (Ben Affleck) when he became Blind as a young boy however he gain special powers that allows his other senses to increase. Now as a adult he works as a lawyer by day and the crime fighter Daredevil by night. Then one day he meets Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) which catches the attention of Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and his boss The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) making them both a target.Casting wise I enjoy seeing Jennifer Garner as Elektra who said she read a lot of Elektra comic books to prepare for the role of Elektra, Colin Farrell show case how he could play a villain and seem to have enjoy playing Bulleyes they made him look like the character in the comic book, Michael Clarke Duncan did a strong job as The Kingpin normally I saw him as a protagonist but here he was an antagonist really show case his talent as a actor.Ben and Jennifer both had a strong chemistry on screen together and each scene they were in made the film enjoyable. The fight scenes are very well done and the taunts were quite clever when you watch the film you get to see why they actually took the time to make the fight scenes worth watching in the film.Music wise it is awesome with songs from bands like Evanescence and Fuel the soundtrack for the film is one of the reasons why I like this movie it's the kind of soundtrack I would buy. The movie features some strong acting, awesome stunts and a powerful score it just more enjoyable than people give it credit for sure it's not a perfect film but I enjoy it nevertheless and I think the Director's Cut could be the one to go for. I give Daredevil an 8 out of 10",Daredevil
87,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,It's a shame that Daredevil received an immense mistreatment of his character.,3,17 August 2018,"Daredevil's been one of MARVEL's most iconic underdog characters: and his movie was a feature-length disservice to that status he gained through the years. I mean talk about a let-down that didn't even come close to the then-recent Spider-Man movie; you go from The Wall-Crawler to The Man Without Fear and the transition in quality is simply jarring on every discernible level.Daredevil meant well, but its cast is simply terrible and it taints the respective characters shown in the movie. There's no doubt that Ben Affleck is a competent actor, but he just wasn't meant to portray superheroes like Daredevil or Batman, and Jennifer Garner makes Elektra out to be a wooden joke of a love interest who's not even close to her comic counterpart. Though the Kingpin is pretty good thanks to the late Michael Clarke Duncan, it still doesn't negate the fact that the better-than-expected baddie is stuck in a film where Duncan's gentle-giant charm is out of place for a character as gritty and grounded as Daredevil is. Duncan's the best part of this movie because he's on a different level to everyone else; he cares about the character's integrity and does his damnedest to stay close to the Kingpin in the comic books for all that it's worth.Daredevil isn't as bad as MARVEL's other outings like Howard the Duck (1986), Captain America (1990), or Elektra (2005) but it's a tonal mess that tries seguing between dark and light-hearted fun that just doesn't work in the movie's, or the source material's, context.Please note that this review is allocated for the original theatrical release: I have not seen the Director's Cut nor do I really intend to.",Daredevil
88,KUAlum26,Strictly passable,5,23 May 2006,"I have a rule of thumb that says that if you have any doubt as to how good a film might be, you might want to take into consideration(among other things)WHEN the film is released. This film was released in February/March of 2003,and that is generally NOT a good sign.Blind defense attorney Matt Murdoch(Ben Affleck,handsome and ineffectual as always)defends the scum of society,gets them off and then hunts them down to exact his own justice. At some point,he crosses paths with Elektra Natchios(Jennifer Garner(sexy,not particularly effecting either) in his war against dominant crime boss Kingpin(Michael Clarke Duncan,who may be miscast here) and the maniacal assassin he's employed,who goes by the id of Bullseye(Colin Farrell,who is really ""Irishing"" it up here). She wrongly believes that HE is responsible for her father's murder and thus begins a sort of revenge-fueled,three-way war between and among the title character and no fewer than three other super-characters. Somewhat along for the ride(and,IMHO probably the best turn in the show) is Matt's colleague Froggy Nelson(Jon FAvreau),who kind of acts as Matt/Daredevil's friend and conscience.I'm not too tough to please with comic-book movies generally,and this movie was not a complete waste of time,but it did feel like it was made almost entirely for looks. A very showy set,special effects and series of fight sequences allows for one to be distracted but not necessarily entertained or satisfied. I suppose if one isn't too picky with their Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Actioner movies,this film will be a decent--maybe even great--renter. For anyone else,it might seem rather forced and easily forgettable. Give it a try and see if you don't agree.",Daredevil
89,pyrocitor,"Compelling, appealingly gritty, brutally honest and seriously underrated - a worthy translation of the comic",8,7 August 2009,"Come its release in 2003, in the wake of a series of critically and commercially lucrative superhero films, Daredevil was greeted with a slew of disdain, generally being viewed as overly self-indulgent and a step in the wrong direction for the scarcely emerging genre. And while many of the criticisms directed at the film may have been, to some degree, warranted, it becomes increasingly clear over time exactly how unreasonably maligned and seriously underrated the film has become. As such, while Daredevil may hardly be a cinematic masterpiece, there are so many painfully laudable components intact within it that to condemn the entire work over its faults would be both unwise and unfair. Fitting with the comic's substantially darker overtones, director Mark Steven Johnson envisions the superhero film as neo-noir, from the compelling shadowy, gritty visuals to the hard edged morality of the characters, pervaded with traditional themes of guilt and redemption through violence. To say Daredevil feels far more real than its fellow superhero films might prove somewhat of an inherent contradiction, given its largely articulated flaws of a patchy script peppered with unrealistic action (could Daredevil really jump off a roof without shattering his knees?) and plot holes. Nonetheless, it is safe to say that nowhere in any of the more celebrated cinematic superhero outings is there a setting which throbs with such a real cinematic voice as Daredevil's Hell's Kitchen, which inhabits the narrative with genuine character and presence, and could hardly prove more of a contrast to the usual bright, glossy sheen seen in other comic book adaptations.Equally elusive elsewhere is the film's sense of rough, brutal emotional honesty, as Johnson's screenplay, despite its structural flaws, demonstrates an uncanny ability to beat its way right into the viewer, making even the most clichéd street jargon and hackneyed lines resonate with surprising credibility and poignancy. Rather than rushing through Daredevil's formative exposition as an excuse to hurry to the fight scenes, Johnson devotes surprising amounts of time to the character's foundational years and gritty, noir-fueled upbringing, making his later yearning for violence justice all the more sympathetic and understandable, and strengthening the film's emotional core. Bleak and full of black and white moralizing as it may be, the film has such an old fashioned, punchy earnestness to it that one cannot help but be drawn in, as with the most successful noirs of old. Even the romantic subplot, often a pitfall in the action genre, feels far more credible and resonant than most contemporaries, all the more from Murdock's willingness to embrace it rather than constantly (and frustratingly) pushing it away, a-la Spider-Man. Similarly, Johnson allows moments of sly humour (Murdock and Elektra's flirting playground fight for example) to punctuate the darkness of his film, never allowing it to become excessively sombre or dour and retaining a welcome sense of fun.But despite this focus on character, Johnson shares his protagonist's fearlessness in regards to delivering visually dazzling, sometimes to the point of being gratuitous action sequences. Yet as over the top as the martial arts medleys are, they are unquestionably thrilling, bursting with the sort of vital energy and breathless cinematic daring that only those willing to submit to such a larger than life feel can attain. Balancing out the choreographed mayhem is the real edge Johnson infuses into his fight sequences, again in contrast to the bloodless, PG sanctioned combats seen in most other superhero bouts. In Daredevil's world, bones crack, blood spurts, teeth are knocked out and the hero, regardless of whatever unreasonable physical feats he may perform, grunts and cries out in real anguish. Johnson also demonstrates a flair for impressive imagery, envisioning Daredevil's 'radar sense' (visually translating sound after being blinded as a child) in a compelling, beautifully cinematic fashion, and demonstrating some impressively inventive cinematography and sense for real money shots (such as the film's opening, with Daredevil entwined around a crucifix, tastefully borrowed from the comic). And Graeme Revell's soulful score powerfully completes the package, despite its frugal borrowing from modern rock music sometimes feeling a touch excessive. Even the cast of celebrities manage to put their own memorable spin on the array of colourful characters while still remaining faithful to their comic book incarnations. Ben Affleck brings a poignantly wounded, savage guilt to the dual lives of blind lawyer Matt Murdock and vigilante superhero Daredevil, convincingly passing as visually impaired while also infusing Murdock with a cheeky confidence - despite fears of miscasting, an impressively resonant take on the iconic hero. As privileged socialite turned vicious warrior Elektra, Jennifer Garner also demonstrates an appealing cocktail of toughness and vulnerability, with her wispy smile belying a realm of seething emotions underneath. Counterbalancing the compelling protagonists, Michael Clarke Duncan turns his Kingpin of crime into a terrifyingly credible foe, his fearsome physicality representative of his insidious political connections, and Duncan makes every frown or twitch of the mouth into a chilling threat. But it is Colin Farrell who shamelessly steals the show as psychotic super-assassin Bullseye, chewing the scenery with ferocious, inventive energy. Alternatively hilarious, horrifying and sickening, Farrell is grotesquely memorable and a delight to watch, nearly making the film worthwhile by himself. But even the supporting roles are filled with capable performers, as Joe Pantoliano makes his jaded reporter Ben Urich a tiny triumph of noir characterisation and Jon Favreau is welcomely comical as Murdock's fast talking partner in law 'Foggy' Nelson. While the choppy editing and sometimes shaky script do prove problematic, Daredevil boasts such an array of appealing elements to redeem its speckling of faults and emerge as a compelling, thought-provoking and shamelessly fun film in spite of it all. Both brutally honest and unabashedly fantastic, Daredevil achieves a realm of hyper-cinematic reality, making its contradictions often serve in its favour, and making it a rare gem of a watch, easily worth rediscovering. -8.5/10",Daredevil
90,Sirus_the_Virus,The worst comic book film to date.,1,23 August 2009,"I've hated a few comic book film that have been released. Hulk was a bad film. Batman & Robin absolutely blew, it's cheesiness made me sick, I hated it. Then came Daredevil. Which is probably the stupidest and worst of them all. Here's why. Daredevil is a waste of time and life and it's retarded. It's about a blind man who fights crime. What's next... is Stevie Wonder going to become a referee? How can you fight crime if you're blind? All you have to do is stick a cane through somebody. There the battle is over.I may be being too kind giving Daredevil 1 star. How could somebody recommend Daredevil? I don't know. Daredevil... is pure stupidity. Daredevil is the story of a blind man who is a lawyer and begins to fight crime. He thinks that the Kingpin(Michael Clarke Duncan) made him blind. So he begins fighting crime as Daredevil(Ben Affleck).The blind dude meets Elecktra Nachos(Jennifer Garner, I think that's her name). When her father is murdered, she believes Daredevil did it. But it was actually Bullseye(Collin Ferrell, who is terrible in this). Bullseye never misses a target. For instance, he flings a peanut into a baddalax's throat. Elecktra trains herself and plans to get revenge. And her name is now Elecktra. Wow, how creative. What I hated about Elecktra and Daredevil is that they sucked. Elecktra made no sense. Saying that these pieces of junk sucked is not an excuse for saying why I hated it. I hated it because I think that a blind hero is pretty stupid. I got that Justice is Blind thing but for them to go all literal is stupid.Let's look at the positives. I liked Jennifer Garner as Elecktra. I know she was cheesy but I liked her in that outfit. They should've had Jessica Alba as Elecktra. She doesn't deserve to be invisible. But Jennifer Garner looks good enough. Colin Ferrell is retarded as the villain. I know damn well it's not his fault. Director Mark Steven Johnsonis a terrible director. I mean, i liked Ghost Rider for some reason. Despite it's flaws. This film is another story. I'd rank Daredevil as terrible, because that't what it is.",Daredevil

And here he comes face to face with Kingpin. The man responsible for the death of his father.Ben Affleck plays the role convincing as the lawyer/vigilante; while Electra is played by the beautiful Jennifer Garner; Colin Farrell plays Bullseye.....Didn't quite find it convincing....And the role of Kingpin is given to Michael Clark Duncan who is satisfying.....The action scenes could have been much better......The irony is Jon Favreau is in the movie who went onto direct the great Marvel epic 'Iron-Man'....YAY.",Daredevil

Unfortunate, but interesting.  I was simply surprised at this movie.  The CGI isn't too bad either.The female is alot smarter than Kirsten Dunst.  And certainly points to better things to come.I do think it was a little slow in the middle, but once Devils girlfriends father is killed, and later she is (or so we thought.. hint hint). It gets alot of fun to watch.  Though seeing the kingpin have his legs break and his pain seems scripted, but not acted. I certainly hope there is a sequel. Loved the end credits with Bullseye.

93,DunnDeeDaGreat,Marvel has another good comic book film on their hands,9,13 February 2003,Daredevil is by no means a perfect film but when it comes to eye candy films I take them for what they are which is eye candy. Ben Affleck plays Matt/DD very well he actually surpised me with his performance. The film has a dark tone and isn't all colorful like Spider Man was. Colin Farrel and Micheal Clarke Duncan as the villians do good jobs but Colin steals the show as Bullseye. In my opinion Farrel did one of best comic book villain jobs since Jack as The Joker. When it comes to Jenifer Garner as Elerkta she did a good job she's sexy as always. My only complaint with the film was I feel it needed more action but I guessing if this is a hit then Fox will fill the sequel with loads of action. It's a fun film just don't take it seriously.

94,emasterslake,As Bad as the Spider Man Movies,5,20 February 2006,"First off i'm not a DareDevil Fan. I never was in the past.And Second, this movie wasn't all that great.

Lives as a Blind Lawyer by Day, and Devil by night. He eventually encounters the one responsible for his father's death.This movie has good special effects, just it lacks story plot in all. I'm not an expert on the DareDevil universe, but I think this movie needed a better script. And it needed some better direction and a better ending.In a long review short, THIS MOVIE SUCKS! I'M GLAD I DIDN'T WAIST MY MONEY ON SEEING!And to think the Spider Man Movies were bad. Those who don't like DareDevil won't like it. Not sure if all you DareDevil fans out there would enjoy.

96,Victor Field,"""Daredevil"" is the ""Dick Tracy"" of superhero movies. Except that Jennifer Garner improves on Madonna.",4,2 March 2003,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls; this review contains spoilers. This is also not written by someone who's a true comic book fan, so you may want to bear that in mind.At one point in ""Daredevil,"" we're at a funeral. The weather is gloomy, the mood is grim, and the victim has been brutally murdered by the villains. And what am I thinking? ""Boy, I'd like to make love to Jennifer Garner."" (And other similar thoughts.)The point is, that sums up everything that's wrong with this movie; it almost completely fails to engage your emotions in the way it should, thanks mainly to Mark Steven Johnson's script and direction (this is also the man who bastardized John Irving's wonderful novel ""A Prayer For Owen Meany"" and turned it into ""Simon Birch,"" which should have been a warning). The movie probably couldn't help following the template set by other, far better movies, but it falls so far short that it seems like you're watching a wall for close to two hours for all the impact it causes.""Daredevil"" did have a lot of problems to overcome, to be fair; unlike Batman, Spider-Man or even the Hulk (coming soon to a theatre near you), he didn't have years of mainstream fame and pre-selling via television on his side. But that's still no excuse for our hero being so bland and unthrilling onscreen - there's no frisson in seeing a blind crimefighter leaping around the streets of New York, chiefly because while Ben Affleck can be good in other roles, he's not charismatic enough to pull the Man Without Fear off (ironically, he's a bit more adept as Matt Murdock). Not that he gets much help from the poor effects - shockingly, the usually fine Digital Domain are among the companies credited - or the editing suite; when he goes after a rapist who's been acquitted the result is just a mess instead of exciting. And as the Irish priest (aaarrgghhh!) who's our hero's mentor points out, that costume doesn't help.The movie also suffers from the lack of a decent story or characterisation - good guys and bad guys alike are barely built up; the prologue explaining our hero's early life (how he was blinded, what happened to his father to make him take up becoming a vigilante) is more affecting than most of what follows. As a result, it's easier to take pleasure from the little things, like the cameos from Stan Lee and Kevin Smith, than in the bigger picture. The attempts to introduce some edge into the proceedings - Daredevil is more ruthless in his life than the Wallcrawler ever was, and the scene where Bullseye uses paperclips to kill a man is (rather worryingly) played for laughs - just make the movie more unpleasant, and we all know how well that worked with ""Spawn."" And on top of all that, musically it's poor; Graeme Revell's score is as banal as ever once the main titles are over (even Michael Kamen would have been better), and the songs not only prove that this devil doesn't have all the best tunes but are also used on the soundtrack with all the subtlety of a nuclear warhead.On ""American Bandstand,"" Dick Clark used a rating system which was based on the theory that while no song is perfect, no song is all bad either (the scale topped off at 98 instead of 100, and bottomed out in the 30s instead of zero). Similarly, ""Daredevil"" does have its good points: step forward Jon Favreau (fun as Murdock's partner-in-law), the lad who plays the younger version of our hero, the special effects for the point-of-view shots when he ""sees"" things with his unique form of radar, Joe Pantoliano as a tabloid journalist, Imaginary Forces (for the excellent opening title sequence with the credits appearing in Braille - and the names of the four main actors and the title of the movie being formed thusly in the New York cityscape), Colin Farrell (Michael Clarke Duncan spends all his time glowering as the Kingpin, but Farrell is the movie's real star bad guy as Bullseye - even if he does overact a bit), and Jennifer Garner (who doesn't get to do too much as Elektra, but still comes across better than Affleck and the scene where she gets ready to go into action is one of the movie's few real highlights).You see that row of asterisks below? It means it's time for a spoiler.* * * * * * * * * *It also means that the moment where she's mortally wounded by Bullseye (shortly before he himself is sent plunging to his fate by Daredevil) is one of the movie's few real emotional grabbers; some have claimed she died, but we don't actually see her leave this mortal coil onscreen, and as noted Murdock finds her pendant on the scene later, leaving an indication that her promise that she'd find him has been kept. From what I understand of the comics, Elektra died and came back to life there, so it wouldn't be against the canon. (Plus it wouldn't be fair to the males in the audience if they killed off Jennifer Garner and left Ben Affleck alive.) And if Bullseye can survive falling from a great height onto a car - as anyone who stays through the end credits will attest - then we can surely expect someone on the side of right to be similarly blessed.* * * * * * * * * *""Daredevil"" isn't a true stinker, but it's a colossal letdown after ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men""; it doesn't even measure up to ""The Phamtom"" or ""The Shadow"" (and there are few criticisms more cutting for a movie like this than to say it doesn't measure up to ""The Phantom""). It's more like ""Dick Tracy,"" in that it's a botched attempt to bring an unfamiliar veteran of the comics to the big screen, minus Danny Elfman - if you don't count the Regency logo (which is an extract from his main title to Regency's ""Sommersby,"" incidentally) - or Al Pacino's entertaining scenery-chewing, but with the anorexic storyline and uninvolving lead character. But Twentieth Century Fox is on the right track with the mooted Elektra movie; the talented and beautiful Jennifer Garner is the real reason to ""Get Ready For DD-Day.""",Daredevil

98,DarthBill,A somewhat valiant effort...,4,14 April 2003,"When it was announced that Ben Affleck would be playing Daredevil/Matt Murdock, the reaction was more or less what Michael Keaton got when it was announced he would be playing Batman/Bruce Wayne back in 1989. Keaton, a slender, 5'10"" actor best known for his comedies, seemed like the last person you'd put in a batsuit, but he displayed a kind of tragic irony blended with recently untapped fierceness that made him a winner in the end. Affleck, a broad shouldered, 6'2"" actor best known for the Kevin Smith films and ""Good Will Hunting"" among a few other romantic comedies and bottom of the barrel action films, also seemed like the last person you'd put in the DD costume. But since Michael Keaton proved so many nay-sayers wrong, I was willing to give Benny here benefit of the doubt. And to my surprise, he did a much better job than I thought he would. Was he perfect? Probably not, but Daredevil/Matt Murdock would have been a hard part for any actor to play, since he's blind and that means the actor has to ACT blind. Affleck gives his all, but the script lets him down at times.The film starts off good, but after the first big fight and the sight of our hero chewing on pain killers and ripping a tooth out, the film starts to experience a down moment at the diner scene where Matt Murdock (Benny) and his law partner Foggy Nelson (Jon Favreau) discuss their clients and we find out that some of their clients are so poor that they pay in fish, cheese, and sporting equipment. An ethical lawyer who wants to help the less fortunate is one thing, but being payed in fish, cheese and sporting equipment? That's just stupid. Then we meet Elektra (Jennifer Garner). Or rather, the new Elektra, since the film Elektra bears almost no resemblance to the comic book character, and I'm not just talking about looks. I'm willing to tolerate an actor or actress who doesn't quite match the character's appearance, but they have to stay true to the character. In the comic books, Elektra dated Murdock in college and left him when her foreign national father was murdered. She went to Japan and studied martial arts from this Ninja clan called the Hand so she could seek revenge, but eventually lost track of her old life and became a relentless killer. But here, she's a good natured rich girl who just happens to be a kick ass martial artist and just happens to have a leather outfit in her closet along with swords and what have you. I really wished they'd tried to adapt her original story line, it would have worked much better than this 10 minute infatuation. Not to mention that the fight in the playground was just plain stupid, serving as nothing more than excuse to showcase some fancy wire work. That and a blind man can NOT be a skirt chaser, he just can't! Nor should he be able to afford an apartment that has a hidden room where he can keep multiple masks and costumes.Colin Farrel and Michael Clarke Duncan make the most of their villains, Bullseye and Kingpin, respectively, but for once I think we've been given a movie where the villains don't have enough to do.Not to mention that the fight scenes are so poorly filmed and edited that it's nearly impossible to see what's going on.And what's really sad is that this sticks a lot closer to it's source than some other super hero films (cough ::X-Men:: cough). I don't think Mark Steven Johnson, a so called Daredevil fan, was the right man for this job, I really don't.",Daredevil
99,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Probably not as bad as it could have been.,6,8 March 2019,"Back in the early days of the rising popularity of the superhero movie, long before cinematic universes and multi-film crossovers, there were a handful of films that brought these comic book characters to the big screen. From Spider-Man (2002) to X-Men (2000) to The Punisher (2004), one of these films was none other than Daredevil (2003). For many years, I had seen these films, even going so far as having seen Hulk (2003). The one I had not seen was Daredevil, mostly because I had heard it was so bad. I had seen Hulk, so I knew how bad they could be.Now that a Director's Cut of Daredevil was available, I heard it improved on the original and decided to just skip the original cut entirely. With no understanding of what the film used to be, I can say that the Director's Cut isn't completely terrible. Sure, some of the lines are goofy, and the actors chosen for the roles might not have been the best choices, but it's a solid film. I did find it interesting how many actors who have had better success with directing were present in this film. From Ben Affleck (The Town (2010) and Argo (2012)) to Jon Favreau (Iron Man (2008) and The Jungle Book (2016)), and even a cameo appearance by Kevin Smith (Clerks (1994) and Chasing Amy (1997)), these actors definitely work better behind the camera.Even with the Director's Cut being a supposed improvement on the film, there still seemed to be too many sub-plots all running at once, each one of which I felt didn't get nearly enough screen time to fully explore what was happening. Another problem with this film is that it has not aged well. From the soundtrack being clearly inspired by the music of the time, to the CGI showing the limitations of the computers at the time, all these things just scream ""2003"" to me.Probably not as bad as it could have been, I give Daredevil (Director's Cut) 3.0 stars out of 5.",Daredevil
100,stamper,Bleak superhero stuff,4,12 October 2003,"Well, Marvel is getting a lot of their comic book heroes translated to film and to be honest they aren't all that good. I must admit though, that I've not seen a complete failure yet. This also means that this film is not a complete failure, although in my mind it has much more weaknesses than the other recent Marvel films.
Before watching this film, I didn't really have too high hopes. I thought that Ben Affleck as a superhero would be somewhat of a laugh, plus I really thought that his costume was a bit gay. Also I didn't really enjoy the idea of the Kingpin being black. It's not that I'm not racist, it is just that I'm used to a white Kingpin from the animated comic book series of Spider-Man. So before viewing this film, the only possible upside to this film was Jennifer Garner's cuteness (judging from the trailers).
The film itself has a pretty good beginning and a pretty good ending, intervened by parts of somewhat instable quality. The strange thing for me was, that I actually enjoyed the parts in which the Daredevil was normal' much more than the parts in which he was a superhero. I felt that Affleck really got his character down good, as did most of the cast with the weakest character (in my mind) being Bullseye. What somewhat bugged me in this film though were the action scenes. They tried to be spectacular with the sole purpose of being that and I feel that many times they struck out. The action scenes were not spectacular. They were not even filmed in a good manner at times and last (but certainly NOT least) they sometimes weren't even properly built up to. What I saw here were a bunch of pretty good actors, working with good stunt coordinators and a director who knows some minor basics in directing action sequences. Not everything is to blame on the director though. The script is pretty thin and the music is too much focused on selling the soundtrack. There seems to be no real place and time for emotion of the personal drama and ambiguity surrounding Daredevil or Elektra. There was potential here, but it was wasted at times. If you're in it for the action go see a Matrix sequel, if you're in it for the comic book hero, see Spider-Man, X-Men or even Superman from 1978. If you're in it for Ben Affleck, enjoy Gigli and if you're in it for Jennifer Garner, hell wait two years for her to star in the spin-off Elektra.

101,ivo-cobra8,"Defending and underrated superhero action flick, One of my favorite films!",7,19 October 2015,"Daredevil (2003) Director's Cut is very underrated American Action superhero flick. I did saw the theatrical cut in in 2004/2005 and I loved it. I don't care if this film is terrible, for me it is good I love it. I think Ben Affleck did a perfect job at acting as Matt Murdock/Daredevil! This is always been my favorite superhero flick out there and it still is. Jennifer Garner as Elektra did a terrific job as the female hero and she was pretty good. Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin did all great on their performances on their characters. I love this film and I don't care how underrated it is I love it.I am defending this film and I don't think is awful , bad or terrible it is great. It is kind of Entertaining and it is still a good film. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Okay, it isn't a classic like are The Dark Knight Trilogy or other Marvel highly rated films. It is still a good, both of the versions are good but I just prefer the Director's Cut because the film explains much more than the theatrical cut douse and ends with a cliffhanger. Daredevil features another hero without super strength, just the ability to use what he has to maximum potential, making him a more accessible hero to the masses.Ben Affleck (Pearl Harbor) portrays Matt Murdock, a man blinded since childhood after accidental exposure to hazardous materials. By day, Murdock is an honest attorney from Hell's Kitchen, New York. By night, he is Daredevil, a superhero relying on an incredibly attuned sense of hearing (a ""radar sense,"" as he calls it) to fight criminals. Following the death of his father, Matt vows revenge on The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, The Scorpion King), who teams with the villainous Bullseye (Collin Farrell, Phone Booth) in a move against Daredevil, Matt must not only fight two super-criminals, but deal with a burgeoning relationship with the mysterious -- and deadly -- Elektra (Jennifer Garner, Juno).The director's cut is way better than the theatrical version. There is more storyline to this version, more action, more humor! In this version there is an added storyline which makes the movie way easier to understand, it ties together loose strings in the movie. This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The one thing I didn't like about this version is that they take out the confession scene in the beginning of the movie. I recommend it to any superhero fan out their. It is rated R. Mostly for more action/violence. Without question, THIS is the one that should have been released in theaters, not the other version. Underrated of the marvel comic movies For Daredevil, justice is blind, and for the guilty, there's hell to pay!Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner ignite dangerous sparks and nonstop thrills in this dazzling action-adventure about the newest breed of superhero. By day, blind attorney Matt Murdock (Affleck) toils for justice in Hell's Kitchen. By night, he's Daredevil, The Man Without Fear - a powerful, masked vigilante stalking the dark streets with an uncanny ""radar sense"" that allows him to ""see"" with superhuman capabilities. But when the love of his life, fiery Elektra Natchios (Garner), is targeted by New York City's ruthless Kingpin of crime (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his deadly assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrell), Daredevil may be about to meet his match Daredevil is a 2003 American superhero film written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the film stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who fights for justice in the courtroom and out of the courtroom as the masked vigilante Daredevil. Jennifer Garner plays his love interest Elektra Natchios; Colin Farrell plays the merciless assassin Bullseye; David Keith plays Jack ""The Devil"" Murdock, a washed up fighter who is Matt's father; and Michael Clarke Duncan plays Wilson Fisk, also known as the crime lord Kingpin.Why I love this film? Because Ben Affleck is one of my favorite actors and I just love what he does in this film. There's the right balance of action romance. There has been criticism about Ben Affleck acting. In his defense , Ben and Jennifer do have chemistry that works and goes somewhere.You can see he is taken with her. Even Ben and Jon Favreau friendship works for their characters Matt/Daredevil and Foggy. They are genuinely funny. I love this film. The rating I am giving is 7 because the film wasn't that good, but it wasn't that bad either. 7/10 Score: B Studio: Marvel Enterprises, New Regency Pictures, Horseshoe Bay Productions Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, J.K.

102,Agent_Iris,A complete disservice to Daredevil,1,7 October 2020,"What a wretched film!The script is meandering and poorly written and I can't think of a single character in this film who doesn't come off like a total buffoon.Most of the acting is embarrassingly horrible.Matt Murdock sleeps in a coffin where his ears are immersed in water so he can dampen his supersonic hearing in order to get a good night's sleep.Some loud noises bother his ears, while others do not - It depends on whatever the script calls for to move things along.His calling card is an interlaced ""DD"" symbol written on concrete with gasoline that only becomes visible when it is set on fire.I still can't believe that Hollywood had the audacity to follow up this turkey with a stand-alone Electra film.On second thought, I can totally believe that that happened.",Daredevil

104,manitobaman81,Good,7,23 August 2014,"Here you will find a bit of realism existing in a delusional world. Affleck is able to show that Daredevil isn't being two different people, but one man forced to go against his heart if he wants to survive, in a measured performance. He strikes a rhythm with his role and it, combined with the entertainment of a drama that feels real, makes the movie go at a nice pace. There is a real duality to all the characters. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. It gives a picture of a backwards society that diminishes reality, where culminating incidents brought by suffered individuals show the truth. 7/10.",Daredevil

For entertainment it is good but nothing else.",Daredevil
106,Prichards12345,Not nearly as bad as it's made out to be.,7,17 November 2016,"Daredevil is kind of shallow fun, and if you've seen the director's cut (which is the version I've rated) you will know that this version would have been much better received had it been released in the cinema.Ben Affleck ain't great in this, to be honest; but he's not terrible. I liked Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin and enjoyed an OTT Colin Farrell as Bullseye. Jennifer Garner is better here than she was in the terrible Elektra solo movie, and the origin story is faithful to the comics.It certainly isn't as dark as it could be, but strikes a balance between humour and tragedy. Elektra believing Daredevil is her father's murderer is ripped straight from Spider-Man, though. Farrell offing the old lady on the plane is pretty funny.If Daredevil tries to be all things to all men it's at least partially successful in most of what it attempts. And the climactic battle in the church between Daredevil and Bullseye is rather well done.Pretty decent, then. And nowhere near the disaster some have made it out to be.",Daredevil
107,tomimt,Nothing works in this poor excuse of a movie,3,12 March 2005,"Of all the superhero flick produced lately Daredevil is the poorest excuse of a movie. I haven't seen the directors cut, which is said to be better, and frankly after seeing this theatrical release I have no interest to. Anything would be improvement over this. Not even Jennifer Garner in her tight Elektra outfit could safe this movie, least of all Ben Afleck (Daredevil), who just can't act to safe his life.And Colin Farrel as Bullseye? That could have been great. Colin could out act anyone in this movie but no. Even he can't turn that piece of bleepety bleep character into anything decent.In every aspect this was pretty poorly executed film. Even though you can forgive poor plot in an action film, even poor acting, you cannot forgive poorly flowing story.Oh, there was something I liked, besides ending credits, and that was Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin. Definitely a right choice.Draw your conclusions from this.",Daredevil
108,lark40,a defender of the innocence a man without fear the guardian of hell the kitchen is his devil zone his arch nemises unlocks his aim to destroy his soul is his game,8,4 July 2016,"daredevil came out in 2003 with a running time 1hr43mins with a mixture Action, Crime, Drama i gave it 7/10 and barely made 100 million Ben affleck done a good job here you either love him or hate him he is street vigilante crime fighter a local legend that has been seen who falls in love with a beautiful martial arts master called Electra played by a kick ass Jennifer garner but when she and her family are targeted by a vicious assassin called bulls eye played by Colin Farrell who is having major fun her he has the perfect aim a Michael Clarke Duncan who is the kingpin in hell's kitchen but the story starts with A man blinded by toxic waste which also enhanced his remaining senses like sonar vision into shadow world were he can see things only in pulses of rain were he can see things in shadows like when he meets electra on top of the roof to kiss her amazing graphics in the way he vibrates his walking stick to see his enemies also like a sonar reflecting of things fights crime as an acrobatic martial arts superhero the director of ghost rider brings his this story to life Mark Steven Johnson bring his magic of special effects to life with using rain as away of Matt/daredevil of seeing his love happiness/sadness to life Ben Affleck ...

Wilson Fisk / The Kingpin i5Jon Favreau Franklin 'Foggy' Nelson Fate deals young orphan Matt Murdock a strange hand when he is doused with hazardous waste. The accident leaves Matt blind but also gives him a heightened ""radar sense"" that allows him to ""see"" far better than any man. Years later Murdock has grown into a man and becomes a respected criminal attorney. But after he's done his ""day job"" Matt takes on a secret identity as ""The Man Without Fear,"" Daredevil, the masked avenger that patrols the neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen and New York City to combat the injustice that he cannot tackle in the courtroom The origin story of the character Daredevil is pretty complicated, but, as the helpful gentleman in the theater so aptly put it, ""He's blind, but he can see stuff blind."" Let's just leave it at this: This caused his other senses to become phenomenally acute, to the point where Matt can track criminals by their scent and use sound waves as a sort of radar. He uses his newfound abilities to protect those who will not be protected by the justice system, all the while hoping that one day he will find the person who killed his father. A Guardian Devil. He is the man without fear Take the dare. When justice is blind, it knows no fear. When the streets have gone to Hell - have faith in the Devil. Justice is blind. So is he. A man without hope, is a man without... fear. Daredevil is gritty and merciless. Whatever you thought couldn't happen in Peter Parker's world will more than likely happen in Matt Murdock's neck of the woods. Because people die here. Sometimes they die slowly and painfully. The superheroes go home with scars on their backs, broken teeth, and more than a few gruesome images that need to be repressed. For all of these reasons I liked Daredevil, because it takes chances by offering a hero that is by no means invincible or conventional. If you're a fan of the first two Batman movies, you'll find a lot to love in Daredevil. There are still some comic book elements that require some suspension of disbelief, like the fact that Matt could construct an entire high-tech lair beneath a church while working as a pro-Bono lawyer, but the movie is not fantasy-driven. The fight scenes will make you wince at their realism, the love story is not corny or forced (as opposed to a certain flick called Just Married), and the characters are complex, uncertain people who just happen to don masks and fight on rooftops.Well, in today's feature, Matt hears someone crying for help, but when his love interest, Elektra, asks him to stay, he actually does. With out-of-left-field scenes like this, I couldn't help but enjoy Daredevil. Some might be surprised at how little screen time the villains get in this movie. Kingpin, a Don Giovini mobster type, and Bullseye, an Irish nut with a couple of loose screws, are important parts of our story, but they don't steal the show. Going back to the Batman comparison, many movie buffs think that Jack Nicholson's role as the joker actually become more interesting than the winged knight himself. Not so in this movie, as Daredevil is the guy whom the role shebang revolves around. By deciding to focus on the hero more than the villain, the audience can get into his head and root for him to the last battle. Matt is a cool guy because he's not a wealthy . Other than his heightened senses and combat skills, he's just a regular guy who happens to like red leather.After X-Men and Spiderman became huge hits, it was expected that Hollywood would start churning out more superhero flicks as fast as they could make them. Thankfully, Daredevil doesn't seem recycled or rushed and actually brings something new to the table. they should make a sequel",Daredevil
109,Bogmeister,"Not a Bullseye, not too Daring",5,29 July 2005,"I didn't ""get"" Daredevil when I first saw it - this was the theatrical version. It was a loose compilation of scenes, hastily put together, 2 or 3 swift fight scenes and no strong story to hold anything together. The Director's Cut explains that - there were too many missing scenes - but it didn't really cause me to raise my grade much. We start with the title character, a super-hero played by Ben Affleck, who didn't even bother to get into proper shape for the role. He's not mean & lean in the suit - just an actor going to a Halloween party. A so-so actor, and they picked one of the tallest (and ungainly) actors to play one of the smallest (and most agile) Marvel super-heroes. Most of the computer FX of 'him' leaping among buildings just don't work, it's obvious animation. It doesn't matter how dark you make the scenes or how many fake scars you place on his body - if it comes across as fake, it doesn't work.On the positive side, we have Farrell as Bullseye, one of the best and most intense villains in Marvel comic books, and much of that is captured here. There's possibly too much humor in his role, but he carries it off - his character really is insane - you feel that; you don't even need to see the bullseye scar on his forehead to know it. In between we have the Kingpin and Elektra characters. Neither of the actors have much to work with and do the best they can: Kingpin is a big, powerful bully and Elektra is a lonely, fierce rich girl, driven to revenge in the 2nd half. Now, in the comic books, the story of Elektra covers years; that same story is compressed into days in this pic. Here is the weakness of the script and the inexperience of the director.Here is an instance when the comic books provide a much more rich, layered version of the same story. The writer and director took all the best elements and events of the books and jammed them all into one 2-hour film, which, again, covers only several days. There's no time for Matt & Elektra to get to know each other, not with the intensity which should be evident in their scenes together. There shouldn't be enough time for Daredevil to figure out who the Kingpin is and confront him. The hero is impaled by one of Elektra's blades and seems half dead in a church; moments later, the wound is gone - it has to be so he can battle the villains within the next 15 minutes. There's quite a lot of fighting in the last half hour, but it doesn't add up to much. I did like the FX associated with the hero's radar sense, especially in the rain. And the supporting players are all fine - even Kevin Smith in his silly one scene.",Daredevil
110,LebowskiT1000,I got what I wanted to get out of the film.,8,16 February 2003,"First of all, I should say that I know very little about the Daredevil comic book.  I knew the basics...I knew he was blind, I knew (vaguely) how he became blind, and I'd heard of Elektra and Kingpin, but that was the extent of my knowledge in the Daredevil universe.  I'm not even sure if I'd ever heard of Bullseye, but I probably had.With all that said, I have to say that I got exactly what I wanted to get out of the movie.  I wanted a fun and exciting movie, with some cool effects, good acting, decent story and cool characters.  I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of a film of this caliber being directed by someone that I'd never heard of (Mark Steven Johnson...although, I did like ""Simon Birch""), but he did a fine job with the film and he's got my respect.The special effects were outstanding!  There were a few times where they looked a little off, but nothing I couldn't deal with.  There were other times where I just grinned like an idiot because they looked so good.  The action and the fights in the film were also very well done, sometimes a bit over-the-top, but again, nothing I couldn't deal with.A great deal of people seem to complain about Ben Affleck playing the role of Matt Murdock/Daredevil, I think he did a fantastic job!  I think he has the perfect look for the role and looks quite cool in that Daredevil suit. Jennifer Garner was nothing less than stunning throughout the film, and she really nailed the role.  Michael Clarke Duncan, Colin Farrell, and Jon Favreau were quite fun to watch, and all played their parts incredibly well. I also enjoyed the acting of Joe Pantoliano (always fun to see his work), Leland Orser, David Keith, Erick Avari and Kevin Smith.  There are also some nice cameos of Stan Lee and Frank Miller.  Personally, I thought everyone in the cast did a fine job with their roles.Every movie has it's flaws, and there are a few things I would like to complain about.  I think they did a bit too much of Daredevil jumping off 40-story building and actually surviving.  I understand that this is a comic book movie that we're talking about, but I think the director should have toned it down a bit.  Also, I feel I have to complain about some of the music in the film.  Some of the music I liked quite a bit, but other times it just didn't seem to fit well.  There were a few other minor things that I didn't like and I would have done differently, but they're really not worth mentioning.All in all, I thought this was a very fun superhero movie and I would definitely recommend it if you like superhero films.  I'm not sure I'd put it on the same pedestal that I put Donner's ""Superman"", Raimi's ""Spider-man"", Burton's ""Batman"" or Singer's ""X-Men"", but this was a good movie and worth my money and time.  I truly hope that you'll give this film a chance and hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Daredevil
111,EmperorNortonII,Blind Justice's Hero,8,23 March 2003,"""Daredevil"" can easily be dismissed as one of many comic book-based movies, what with it coming between last summer's surprise hit ""Spider-Man"" and this summer's upcoming ""The Hulk.""  But this movie does have its saving graces. For one thing, its visuals include Daredevil's point of view: what the sightless hero hears forms images in his mind.  I found this an interesting way to show us his world.  Ben Affleck may not be perfect as a hero, but at least he has a good cast to help him out.  Michael Clarke Duncan pulls off the role of the Kingpin. (So what if he's a different race from the character from the comic book?  This isn't about color, it's about size! I'm pleased that the makers of ""Daredevil"" didn't cast a black actor in this role for the sole purpose of having a black actor!) And Colin Farrell really hits the spot as Bullseye, a super-cool villain with incredible accuracy! (What's a superhero without colorful bad guys?) Probably the most clever aspect of ""Daredevil"" is the references to comic book creators, with the mention of such names as Romita, Bendis and Quesada.  And the cameos by Stan Lee and Kevin Smith don't hurt either!  Even if you don't like ""Daredevil,"" it's decent enough to tide one over until ""The Hulk"" comes out!",Daredevil
112,departed07,I can't picture Affleck as a hero.,6,24 February 2008,"""Daredevil"" follows the footsteps of Spider-Man and X-Men where after these two PG-13 comic books came along, everybody had begged Marvel creator Stan Lee if they could do movies of his creations. He often said yes to all of them.The character of Daredevil is just like all of the comic book characters we read, he has an origin. Young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra) is picked on by bullies while his father (David Keith) can't catch a break in winning one game until a freak accident occurs to young Matt where radioactivity waste hits his eyes blinding the young boy where he has to realize that he can't give up. He realizes that even though he can't see, Matt has gained more within his other senses where he can get a radar vision on what he's seeing despite not being able to see at all. His father gets killed by The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) after realizing that he was suppose to lose in a fight rather than win.As years pass, Matt (played by Ben Affleck) is part lawyer working for those who can't afford to pay and part vigilante who goes by the name of Daredevil, who leaves his trademark after capturing the bad guys.Other characters include Elektra (Jennifer Garner) a beautiful and sophisticated Greek goddess who's the daughter of a billionaire who happens to meet upon Matt where she takes interest in him. Joe Pantoliano plays Ben Urich, a reporter who tries to convince the cops and everybody else that Daredevil is not really a villain but out for justice. Prior to The Kingpin, another villain named Bullseye (Colin Farrell) is called by Kingpin to get rid of the the blind hero and kill Elektra's father.Some parts of the film work, but I had a hard time believing Ben Affleck could play a comic book hero since he often plays sidekicks or people THAT really deserved to die (Armageddon and Pearl Harbor). I however liked the rest of the cast despite that I'm not used to Daredevil compared to characters like Wolverine and Spider-Man.",Daredevil
113,Spanner-2,Entertaining superhero effort,6,19 February 2003,"This film, based on the Marvel Comics superhero, is another worthy adition to the Marvel film stable (which now includes Spider-Man, X-Men, Blade and soon, The Hulk). While not quite in the spectacular level of Spider-Man and X-Men, this one still is a fairly entertaining film that captures the essence of the character. Ben Affleck is a tad bland in the role, but he comes off ok.. Jennifer Garner as love interest/kick ass karate chick Elektra is terrific in her scenes, which unfortunately are too short. Collin Farrell, recently so good in ""The Recruit,"" here gets to scenery chew as the villain Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan as criminal mastermind Kingpin also hits the right notes. The flaws in the film come primarily from director Mark Steven Johnson's unfamiliarity with staging fight scenes and an overreliance on the hong kong fight style, which has long become a cliche worth retiring from mainstream films. Still, an entertaining film for fans of the genre or the stars. GRADE: B",Daredevil

The performances were excellent especially those from Michael Clarke Duncan, Colin Farrell (Hollywood's Next Superstar), Jennifer Garner, and Ben Affleck who gives a surprisingly good performance.
The only flaw the picture has is it's length. At an hour and thirty minutes I felt the movie was too short. I guess we'll have to wait for the DVD to see the original R-rated version. Now this brings an issue to me. When viewing Daredevil what bothered me was all the kids in the movie theater. When I was younger I was quite disappointed when parents began complaining about 'Batman Returns' violence which led to Tim Burton's dismissal. But if parents knew that this movie was almost rated R then why did they take there 6/7/8 year old children?! I hope FOX doesn't take all the complains seriously because if they do then the sequels will suck! And I want this to be a very successful franchise! I think the problem is that most parents think comic books are kiddie stuff! That's incorrect, since the `70s comic books have gotten more and more violent every year with Batman leading the way. I think it's about time that parents noticed that!4(****)out of 4(****)stars",Daredevil
115,FilmFanInTheHouse,Great Comic Book Adaptation (well at least the Director's Cut is),8,2 April 2008,"Daredevil (2003, Dir. Mark Steven Johnson) Blinded by toxic waster when he was a young boy, Matt Murdock has gained enhancements in the remaining senses. With his father murdered, he sees this as a perfect opportunity to fight crime and help the New York City. He becomes Daredevil, and every night risks life to stop those escaping prison. One person who is still free is the biggest crime lord in New York, the Kingpin. Whilst working as a lawyer, Matt becomes the masked hero to track down the Kingpin before anyone else he loves is taken out.Before i saw this i heard about the Director's Cut being better than the theatrical version, and preferring as much extended footage as possible i saw the Director's Cut first. Now i can see why this 'R rated' version gets more praised. The action was not preferred over the story and had a fair share of everything. The story on display was interesting and really gave you more of an idea of what Matt Murdock goes through. The fights are well choreographed and do become quite brutal. It really shows the pain that Matt must go through as Daredevil, both physical and mentally. I saw the theatrical 'PG-13 version' shortly after and can really see what problems viewers were complaining about. Large sections of the story was cut out and the fights were a lot shorter. I definitely made the right choice with selecting the Director's Cut. The one problem i still had with both versions were the introduction of Bullseye. I feel that the character could have been better introduced. Once the film finished, i still had no idea of how Bullseye actually became Bullseye and what his origins were.

116,chrisbrown6453,"Ahhh....It's good to be back. Having spent the last 9 months or so in a review writing semi-retirement, I have been moved by my viewing of Daredevil to begin writing reviews again.",4,18 February 2003,"This film, and again I use that term loosely, opens explaining how Mat Murdock, aka The Daredevil, lived as a boy.  His father, having been a prize fighter in his day, has fallen from his prestige and turned to being a mafia bully (no, it's not Rocky Balboa.)  During a bully session of his own, young Mat has been told that his father is nothing but a leg breaker and he just doesn't want to believe it.  When Mat just happens to be wandering home and stumbles onto his father during one of the aforementioned leg breaking sessions, he gets angry and runs away.  Skateboarding through an industrial park, Mat almost gets impaled by a forklift that barely misses him only to tear open a toxic waste drum and coats Mat with the contents.  Blinded by the waste, young Mat looses his sight, only to develop heightening his other 4 senses.  This, by the way, is where the movie goes wrong.You know what, apparently loosing your eyesight allows you to jump hundreds of feet from building to building.  And also allows you to spin around from a fan in a nightclub.  Please.  Not to mention the fact that we never see the development of `The Daredevil.'  The movie does show 4 or 5 different stages of Mat's life as he grows, but never showing us why he decides to become a crime fighter.  I hated Spiderman, but one thing I did like about it was how they showed us how, and why, he developed into the webbed one. They showed the development of his suit, funny scene it was too.  But The Daredevil just....is.  We last see Mat learning to slide down poles and do `magical, superhero things,' but we never see him develop his suit.  We only discover later that his father's fighting name was The Devil, and he wore red trunks, explaining the Daredevil name and suit color.  And what's with the way he sleeps.  I had to reach deep down and think about it, only to assume he sleeps in a water filled sound poof tub to help drown out the outside sounds his hearing picks up, I assume I'm right about that one.By the way, what's with Ben Affleck's hair?  I guess a blind guy wouldn't have the best hair cut, but he does have friends you know.  You'd think one of them would buy him a brush or something.Please someone tell me what's so hot about Jennifer Garner!?!  Am I missing something?  Everyone's just so excited because the art director decided to put little ol B-cup Jennifer into a push up bra to make her breasts look bigger.  Of course Alias herself looked decent in her fighting scenes, but lacks any real acting skills.  Not even the awesome power of Michael Clarke Duncan could save this one.  He was good but not great, and couldn't save this sinking ship.  Now Colin Farrel, on the other hand.  He is cool!  The roll of Bullseye was great for him.  I really think this guy is going places in film, hopefully as 007.  I would have liked to see more of the creation of The Daredevil himself, as well as more of Bullseye.  Also, this movie could have spent a little more time in the editing booth.  There are many a scene where the cables holding the actors, and spinning the actors can be seen, as well as a few instances where dialog was heard, but no actors mouths are moving. 
So ends another review of a lackluster movie.  In a year producing such great films as T3, the Matrix sequels, and of course the final installment of The Lord of the Rings, Daredevil will truly be forgotten, and hopefully die on the operating table to keep from spawning sequels.",Daredevil
117,PyrolyticCarbon,"A good, entertaining superhero film with some laughs and groans.",7,14 February 2003,"Despite the set dresser sharing my name, I'll try and make this unbiased as possible. Good entertainment, although there were a few flaws in the storyline which we quite astonishing by the end of the movie, and the sets were dressed excellently. The film starts with a sudden rush of typically over explained scenes for dumb audiences, with a particularly annoying over extended answering machine message from an ex-girlfriend that just seems to analyse the entire relationship in minutes. Once this has all been rammed into your head, the film can start to be enjoyed, and with comic moments, slick set pieces and some great characters, it's all too easy, even ignoring some of the way over the top `Matrix' type action.

Still, the disappointments come through again during the final fight scene, there are character inconsistencies and a few plot occurrences that just make no sense what so ever - I shall spare you from what they are. Overall, at the end of it all, it's a good, entertaining film with some laughs and groans. Having been a comic fan of Daredevil, the screen representation is not badly done, still, it didn't seem to have hit the mark, or should I say, Bullseye?",Daredevil

119,BrnzReviews,Ignore The Negative Reviews! Worth The Watch!,8,26 May 2021,"I quite enjoyed this movie, despite the hateful attention it received. I thought the story was spot on with the comics besides the creative differences a creator must alter to make it their own and it works like a charm. I'm a big fan of Ben Affleck he was great as Daredevil, truly iconic role that he has made people remember even though he is Batman now.I thought it was an amazing movie that doesn't deserve the negative reviews its been receiving since release. One of my favourite heroes from the Marvel Universe, cant wait til we see him in the MCU... eventually.Highly recommend! 8/10*****",Daredevil
120,emperor_bender,Snore,3,25 February 2008,"Eh, this movie was pretty bad. Nothing about it really seemed to jump off of the screen. Probably because Ben Affleck is in it. Ben Affleck has a habit of stealing the spotlight and ruining movies with his lousy acting. I honestly don't know what people see in him. He's a terrible actor, he's corny as hell, and he ain't even that good-looking. This movie just further proves my theory. Him and Jennifer Garner don't spark at all. There was no connection there whatsoever. Jennifer Garner wasn't that great either as Elektra. She just didn't fill the part well at all. This isn't her type of movie. The storyline was full of holes also, and wasn't all that interesting. The only good parts were given to the bad guys. Colin Farrell was decent as Bullseye, but he just wasn't given a great plot to work with. Michael Clarke Duncan was good also, but he also fell victim to a lousy Swiss cheese plot. No director's cut could ever make this movie worth watching again. I don't recommend this to people looking for a good action movie, this will disappoint you big time. 3/10. I am afraid to see how terrible Elektra is.",Daredevil
121,supertom-3,Disapointing.,5,17 February 2003,"There have been many comic book to film transitions over the years ranging from the Marvel comic book to cult comics and Manga. The standard is the few genuinely excellent omes such as Batman, Superman, Spiderman and the Crow, to some real cheap and tacky low budget cash ins, Roger Corman being guilty of a number of those. Daredevil is somewhere in the middle.This is an entertaining enough film but its very brash, loud and in your face. It has the suitably dark and eerie visuals that this sort of comic book film needs but the way it was brought out could have beeen much better. This is at the end of the day pure dumb, forgettable fun. The script is weak and all time and effort has gone into making this film cool and creating scenes to fit around the soundtrack. The action is very flashy and dark and while the pacing of the action is good it occasionally becomes incoherant. Other times the Matrix-esque slow motion shots can be a little cheesy.
As you would expect and hope from a production of this magnetute, the special effects are very good. Daredevil soars through the city leaping tall buildings (despite not really having superhuman powers) and the radar vision effect is pretty good to. The majority of the movie was set in the dark so the effects at least get cloaked to a certain extent.Ben Affleck isn't bad as Daredevil. I'm not a big comic book reader and never was so I hadn't really heard anything of Daredevil expect seeing him in a few cartoons and in one of the old Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk movies, so I can't say how much Affleck is really suited to playing Matt Murdock, but he does what he has to fairly well.The plot is standard superhero stuff and the script is a little ridiculous and very obvious. The love story between Affleck and Jennifer Garner is the stuff of Shannon Tweed movies,   within their third scene together (which comes directly after number two, which involves a kiss) they have sex! A word on Jennifer Garner, WOW! She is unbelievably gorgeous and I think the entire male audience of the screening I was at, instantly fell in love. She is not a bad actress either, and I will be watching Alias when its next on. She is garaunteed to hit the big time now I think, and boy can she kick ass!Basically I am a fan of comic book to film transitions and in fact watched one the day before seeing this, which was the mildy better film The Shadow, in terms of the visuals and the story and the fact it felt more like a comic boom movie and less like a music video. While watching this film it had a scene where Daredevils symbol is lit up in flames on a crime scene, this was reminiscant of a similar scene in the Crow. There were similar themes of revenge in that film but it is an example of how to really do a great comic book movie, while keeping a good character and decent script. Daredevil claims to be dark and gruesome, and yes compared to Spiderman maybe but its pretty soft compared to superior comic book capers such as the Crow, Blade and the Punisher.Overall this is worth watching, I'm not going to lie and say it lived up to my expectations because it didn't, and I think many fans will be left wanting, the sequel may improve, but it may never happen. Matt Murdock is one of the more interesting Marvel characters around and I felt he could have had better treatment. Marvel characters are starting to regularly hit our screens now, but we need to see the A-list stuff like Captain America, Fantastic Four, Iron Man, not remakes of The Punisher or other of the less interesting, seemingly rehashed characters. Over the next few years Stan Lee and Co are planning to do loads of movies, but truth be told I only expect a few to be genuinely good. Anyway Daredevil is one to wait for video I think, unless you've got nothing better to do. **",Daredevil
122,christian123,Average Superhero Movie,4,17 May 2005,"Daredevil is a decent film with some very entertaining moments though it never approaches the greatness of X-Men or Spiderman. He dwells in a world of external night--but the blackness is filled with sounds and scents, tastes and textures that most cannot perceive. Although attorney Matt Murdock is blind, his other four senses function with superhuman sharpness. By day, Murdock represents the downtrodden. At night he is Daredevil, a masked vigilante stalking the dark streets of the city, a relentless avenger of justice. For Daredevil justice is blind--and for the guilty, there's hell to pay. I have never read the comic books so I can't compare the two. I wanted to see Daredevil because the special effects looked cool and Jennifer Garner is a really good actress. I was a little disappointed with the film as it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Its not the worst comic book film but its also not really that good. The cast is pretty good with the best being Jennifer Garner. She shines as Electra and is the best part about this film. Ben Affleck did a better job as Matt then I had expected. He isn't actually that bad of an actor and this film proves that. Colin Farrell was entertaining as Bullseye as was Michael Clarke Duncan. Mark Steven Johnson directed and wrote the screenplay for Daredevil. He does a pretty good job keeping the audiences attention (most of the time anyways). The dialog is really lame sometimes and its hard to take this film seriously at times. I couldn't tell it was the directors intention to do that. The special effects are okay but nothing special. The action is nothing new and that was the thing about this film is that you have seen it all before. There wasn't really anything new about this film and that's what made it a little disappointing. In the end, while Daredevil may not be original its still watch able and may be worth a look if you like comic book films. Rating 6.2/10 nothing special but nothing that will make you regret for watching it either.",Daredevil
123,theshadow908,Dark courtroom mystery that just happens to involve a superhero.,8,5 March 2006,"Before reading my review, you should know I am reviewing the Director's Cut DVD and not the theatrical version. I liked the theatrical version as well, but not as much, and anybody who says this is the worst comic book movie ever made needs to pick up the Director's Cut.Daredevil tells the story of Matt Murdock, a lawyer who was blinded as a teenager with toxic waste. Though it took his eyesight, the chemicals gave him something else. A superhuman sense of touch, taste, hearing, and smell. While he works for the law legitimately by day, at night he uses his powers to cross a line he can't as a lawyer.Daredevil is not a perfect film, but it is definitely a good comic book film. It has humour, action, drama, and of course, a love story. The subplot of the film is really good. In any film, a subplot is what makes it really stand up. The theatrical version was totally lacking a subplot, and that's what made it not that great. I really liked how there was a mystery that needed to be solved.The performances are pretty good. I really don't think Ben Affleck is that great of an actor, but he was okay in this. Jennifer Garner was good as Elektra too. My two favourite performances in the film were Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin. Michael Clarke Duncan was a believable Kingpin, and he displayed just the right amount of menace for the role. Colin Farrell plays a great maniac hit-man, that's for sure. The action scenes are great.Really, if you're a Daredevil fan, or just a superhero movie fan, see the Director's Cut of Daredevil, it's really a great film. Shame on the studio execs who thought cutting the awesome subplot would be better. What a mistake that was.8/10",Daredevil

You just know that this movie could have been so much better but sadly enough this movie sinks again in a style (the hip videostyle I call it) I hate so much... Rather than digging out the characters, they spend time on flashing actionscenes that are so exagerrated and flashy done that you are taking a coca-cola out of the freezer while it's on...

125,tankace,Devil's work in here and not in a good way. But something good came out in the end.,5,18 November 2016,"Having praised beyond the necessary the Netflix series Daredevil ,I though to take a dip in to the disappointing film was the first time the Devil of Hell's Kitchen was in to the spotlight, the 2003 film. And here we go!The film tries more or less to give the origin story of Daredevil and that the same time tell the most well known story-line of him, the Elektra series. Also puts him against his most famous antagonist Kingpin. OK thinks you say may go OK, but now it is time to find out what went so, goodness so, wrong and we got that. Grantend the film it isn't a abomination like Batman and Robin, Fan4stic and X-men Origins: Wolverine, but it is pretty bad.The funny part is that when I was in my teens ,I used to like very much, yea I am guilty for that. However I can see now that is bad!So what are its flaws ?One,the character are badly written and portrait. Ben Affleck portrait is totally missed, you see that he tries, but the character is written in such a manner that Mat is practically a womanizer jerk ,who at times only remembers that has catholic up bringing, so Ben Batman"" has no room to work. His suit is... leather, sink tide leather, you supposed to be a ninja not a early 2000' heavy metal fan. Elektra there only for eye candy (I see why a teenage would like this movie) and her character goes nowhere what so ever. The late Micheal Clark Duncan an Kingpin isn't suited for him, that's how far I can go with him, sorry Mr Coffrey, but you didn't give anything good to your role.Two, the effects are bad to a point that are hilarious and break the dark and serious tone the movie tries to pass. Side note here this fashion of over using CGI characters or body-doubles was a dumb idea, proved by that flick and many movies from the late 90' and early 00' and I am glad that it is over and the effects have evolved and used in a much more controlled and organized manner.Three, it is like they tried to remake Spiderman, but make him dark and edgy and R- rated but didn't wanted to lose the audience so they went in the middle and it sucked. When want to make a serious film go and do it, a dark one go all out , a funny the same ,never mix them and hope for the best. It is like the producers of 20th Centure Fox tried to carbon copy the 2002 Spiderman, but wanted to avoid copy cat claims (Just stick to the X-men OK, you going well with them and not with any other superhero team or character, wow and sell fantastic four to Marvel ,I want a good movie with them in before I go bold).Lastly, the music, no clue if they try to find the worst soundtrack of the time, but if they did, they hit on point for the soundtrack is cheesy as hell and hurt my ears to here it, apart that is boring like the flick itself in truth. All in all if something good could be said about this misfire is that is show the end of bad superhero films and when add that next's year Elektra flopped, Fox didn't try again to make a movie again when the , so after a while Marvel took the rights for the characters back and we got the series and everyone is happy now. In short from something here is the proof that we as humans as can learn from our pasted mistakes, for further evidence look the Dark Kinght Trilogy and this year Deadpool, if Batman and Robin and Origins didn't had the backlash they had then we would had got these masterpieces of comic movies.",Daredevil
126,SonicStuart,Pretty good comic book movie although some changes could have been better,7,17 February 2004,"DaredevilGenre: Action/Crime/Fantasy/ThrillerRated PG-13Starring: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan, Colin Farrell and Joe PantolianoThis is one of my favorite comic book superhero movies! This movie is about this guy named Matt Murdock who is a blind lawyer by day but by night he is the man without fear, DAREDEVIL! Matt Murdock (Affleck) went blind when he was a boy in a accident. When Matt lost his sight he got supersonic radar powers in return. Later Murdock meets this martial arts hottie Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) and her father works for the Kingpin (Clarke Duncan) who is the crime wave that has been spreading. When Kingpin finds out about Daredevil he hires Bullseye (Farrell) to take on Daredevil. One of the best parts of when Daredevil was fighting Bullseye is when Daredevil flips and kicks Bullseye off the motorcycle. But when Bullseye kills Elektra's father then she starts thinking that Daredevil was the killer instead of Bullseye and now Daredevil must take down Bullseye and Kingpin. Now overall I thought the movie was pretty good although I would've picked someone else to play Daredevil because I'm not a big fan of Ben Affleck even though he did OK in this movie. Personally I think Matt Damon, Eric Bana or Edward Norton would've been a better Daredevil. Jennifer Garner is a good actress and did okay as Elektra although I think Natalie Portman would've been a better Elektra. As for Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell, I thought they were just fine with their roles. So overall pretty decent movie.",Daredevil
127,GeorgeRoots,A Real Missed Opportunity.,4,4 September 2014,"Aside from a surprisingly great performance from Ben Affleck, what else does ""Daredevil"" have going for it? The short answer is not that much. There's going to always be a level of bias as I am a big fan of the comics (I own the brilliant ""Guardian Devil"" story, written by Kevin Smith which includes an introduction by Mr. Affleck). The character has always intrigued me, A man blinded in youth fights crime in his hometown ""Hell's Kitchen"", whilst struggling against villainy and his beliefs"".Though some stories get incredibly preachy, the franchise has solely been built upon those values to which the movie offers visuals that are taken directly from the comic panels. It's a good sign and promise, and then there's a fight in a church drenched with shabby CGI.Enter Daredevil A.K.A Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who for all the absolute crap in this movie they get wrong, at least pulls you into a somewhat restricted version of the character. As we see the origins of how he came to be, we cut to the future Murdock where he is lawyer by day, vigilante by night. Soon we are introduced to the love interest Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Gardner), who is the far from an exotic Greek assassin and just ultimately feels miscast. And our two villains who are Bullseye (Colin Farrell), and Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan).I would usually go into the story now but there is virtually no narrative, or at least no interesting narrative. Ultimately this boils down to an hour an a half of a few well choreographed, yet half assed battle scenes. Two songs by the Christian band ""Evanescence"", are played back to back in an abysmal choice for their scenarios, and the obvious justice prevails climax. Y'know for such a heavy written character as ""Daredevil"" is, it sure doesn't show in this movie. To be honest, I wouldn't really mind if the finished cut wasn't so horribly acted by the supporting cast, have poorly executed CGI fight scenes that look absurdly fake (Even by early 2000's standards), and feature unimpressive costumes for everyone in the movie.Final Verdict: A comic book movie featuring a very prominent lead, yet an unimpressive supporting cast. Horrendous dialogue and story makes ""Daredevil"" hard to watch, and if you have any hope that the 30 minute ""Director's Cut"" can save the movie. Unfortunately no, it can only add Coolio and more blandness into the mix. 4/10.",Daredevil
128,Donatien3,Director's Cut does the Devil justice.,9,27 September 2006,"While he may not enjoy the popularity of Spider-Man, Batman and Superman, to many of his loyal fans, Daredevil is ""The Man Without Fear."" Over his forty plus-year existence, the likes of John Romita (1960), Stan Lee ('64-69), Gene Colan ('65-75 / '78-79), Frank Miller ('79-83 / '86 / '93-94), John Romita Jr ('88-90), Joe Quesada ('98-2001), Kevin Smith ('98-99 -2001), David Mack ('99-2001), and Brian Michael Bendis (2001-06) have either written or drawn the 'devil. In a nice tribute, many of the minor characters in the movie are named after the preceding men, and Lee and Smith make cameo appearances. Like most of Lee's creations, Daredevil/Matt Murdock came into being through a cataclysmic, if highly improbable, accident. As a young boy, Murdock was a gifted student, encouraged by his father, pugilist Jack ""The Devil"" Murdock, to make the most of his gifts. When a collision with a truck carrying barrels of toxic waste sent him blind, Matt's other four senses were heightened to superhuman levels. He could hear the most minute sound, and discovered a ""radar-sense"", created through vibration, which enabled him to be aware of his surroundings. When his father was murdered for refusing to throw a fight, Matt vowed to bring justice to those who couldn't afford it. By day, he would fight injustice in the courtroom (partnered by best friend Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson); by night, he would become the vigilante Daredevil, defending the crime-ridden Hell's Kitchen.The original theatrical release of 'Daredevil' in 2004, starring DD aficionado Ben Affleck as The Man Without Fear, was, even for the most ardent fan, a flawed film. Its lean running time (99 minutes) and plot holes gave the impression it was just another comic-book action film, and didn't do Daredevil's legacy justice. The DVD release of the director's cut, however, has rectified those errors. Extended by half-an-hour, the addition of a subplot involving Murdock and Nelson defending Duante Jackson (Coolio), who was accused of killing a prostitute, helps tie the story together, with a twist that leads straight to The Kingpin (an imposing Michael Clarke Duncan), who runs Hell's Kitchen. The extra footage also gives 'Daredevil' a much darker edge. There's more violence and a bit more coarse language. The film is not without its lighter moments. The interplay between Affleck and Favreau is almost worth the price of the DVD alone. They even manage to squeeze in references to ""The Gong Show"" and ""Fight Club."" The villains of the piece include Elektra (Jennifer Garner), Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and Kingpin/Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan). Elektra, a trained assassin, falls for Matt, but vows revenge on Daredevil, after mistakenly believing he killed her father during a street battle with Bullseye, a deadly, charismatic murderer who can turn any object into a weapon. The Kingpin runs crime in Hell's Kitchen, intent on eliminating ""The Man Without Fear"" and is shown to be a lot more brutal in the Director's Cut. While there are a few changes from the comic (which seems to be the norm with most comic-to-movie conversions), the fight between Elektra and Bullseye is all but ripped from the pages of Frank Miller's ""The Elektra Saga"".One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is the use of Daredevil's radar sense. Originally shown as a young Matt begins to harness his abilities, it comes to the fore in the bar fight with Jose Quesada, the movie's first real action piece. Daredevil's world is inhabited in blue, with shadows, amplified sounds and aromas, and shows, in some small respect, what it's like to be Daredevil.'Daredevil: Director's Cut' is a vast improvement on the original theatrical release, and may hopefully convince Daredevil's detractors of The Man Without Fear's worth. It's also worth checking out the fifteen minute documentary attached to the DVD release, called ""Giving the Devil his Due"", where director Mark Steven Johnson explains the creation of the new version, and explains why it was necessary in the first place.",Daredevil
129,cosmic_quest,The Director's Cut should have been the only cut,8,13 October 2006,"Daredevil has to be one of my favourite comic book characters so I was very disappointed to by how tame the theatrical version of film was in its attempt to pander to small children in the audience. It was as if the producers didn't understand that 'Daredevil' could not have the broad audience age range that 'Spider-Man' enjoys since it is a much darker story. So, I was delighted to find there was a director's cut DVD produced in a manner that was exactly how 'Daredevil' should be and left me, and I presume many others, feeling this version should have been the only version.'Daredevil' follows the story of Matt Murdock, who when dosed by hazardous chemicals at the age of twelve, is left blinded. But in return for losing his sight, his other four senses are radically enhanced to the point where his hearing provides him with sonar-like vision. By day, Murdock goes on to become a lawyer who will only defend those who he believes are innocent. But by night, he assumes his alter-ego Daredevil to prowl the streets of New York, hunting for criminals who have evaded justice. But with the city under the grip of criminal crime lord Kingpin, it's no easy task for the Man Without Fear.Ben Affleck might be a rather bland actor in his other roles but in this film he was excellent in bringing the reserved, brooding Murdock to life, depicting the burden carried by the character and, ultimately, why Daredevil is a far more tragic hero than Bruce Wayne will ever be. It was also a nice touch in the director's cut to see more of Jon Favreau's Foggy Nelson, Matt's colleague and only real friend, and establish more of a rapport between the two men. Jennifer Garner made a good Elektra but it made for a better film to see a few of her scenes cut in the DC version in order to spend more time developing Matt. Michael Clarke Duncan, as the Kingpin, and Colin Farrell, as Bullseye, both filled roles of psychotic villains well although Duncan's character could have had a few more scenes to properly explore why he was so feared.As much as the theatrical version dished out this idea of a Daredevil who happily pranced around dealing with criminals, the director's cut depicted the character more accurately as a man deeply troubled by his past, haunted by his abilities (he doesn't have Superman strength, he can be hurt and does tire, but he does have the hearing that captures every cry for help and every scream of victims' pain) and very alone in the world. It also shows there is this slightly manic side to Murdock when he is determined, which not only makes him very dangerous but also isolates him from others. Further more, the director's cut both offers up superior fight scenes (finally, it's easy to see why criminals fear Daredevil) and explores on a deeper level the connection between Matt and Elecktra and Matt and his friend Foggy.I'd recommend the theatrical version (which I'd only give rating of six out of ten) to comic book fans wishing to introduce the character to the under twelves but everyone else should stick with the first-rate director's cut, which quite simply is the Marvel version of 'Batman Begins'. It's not afraid to explore the darker side to Daredevil or what he does.",Daredevil
130,jb_campo,Excellent cast makes this a terrific story,8,20 April 2014,"I give DareDevil high grades, 8/10, strongly due to the excellent casting. Affleck is a terrific DareDevil who seems to exude confidence as a lawyer, but then exudes pain as a tortured soul. Look for his father, the boxer, who I remember from Officer and a Gentlemen. Jennifer Garner is another good casting as the sexy Elektra. But the stars really are Colin Farrell who plays the totally lunatic assassin BullsEye to the T. And Paul Michael Duncan steals the show as Kingpin.Every time DD goes back out to fight the bad guys, you feel for his pain, like his father who fought against the mob way, and had the courage to stand up for what really mattered to him. DD does the same, in a similar high stakes game of cat and mouse with Kingpin and BullsEye. The mood is dark and somber. The ""sight"" of DD is artfully depicted. The story evolves so in the end, you are rooting for the good guys to take down the bad guys, and you are not sure if that's possible. I'm surprised there was never a sequel because this movie delivered. An interesting story, excellent casting, and solid acting make this the movie you should watch if you are in the mood to see one of those good ole good vs. bad guy films, a la Death Wish or other vigilante shows like The Equalizer. Hence, my 8/10. Enjoy.",Daredevil
131,squirrel_burst,Upgrade to the Director's Cut and you've got yourself a solid Superhero flick,8,12 April 2015,"This might date this review a bit, but let me begin by saying that I am watching this film well before ""Batman vs. Superman"" is being released, and I don't know what all of the Ben Affleck hate is about. I know there's a new ""Daredevil"" show out on Netflix as well and it's sure to gather a lot of people dismissing that ""old movie"" as trash, but hey, just wait a moment. I've just finished the director's cut (which ads a full 30 minutes to the running time), and it does have some flaws but otherwise this is a solid 2000's superhero movie. I like it a lot and putting it in the same category as ""Ghost Rider"" or ""Fantastic Four"" is a grave mistake. I can't remember what the theatrical cut was like, but this version runs about 2hrs and 15 minutes so there are some significant changes.When Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) was a boy, he was blinded by a chemical spill. It wasn't a total loss though because his remaining senses where enhanced to superhuman level. As an adult, he uses his sonar-like hearing to walk around as if he could really see, but he pretends to be just a regular blind guy. It's the perfect disguise for his superhero alter ego, Daredevil. When Matt and his legal partner ""Foggy"" (Jon Favreau, who like Chris Evans also went on to star in some of the best Marvel films) take on a case, it all seems to point towards the ever-elusive, legendary, Kingpin of Crime (Michael Clarke Duncan). Daredevil works his way up the ladder, encountering the crackshot assassin Bullseye (Collin Farrell) and a lovely lady named Elektra (Jennifer Garner).What I like about this movie is that it spends ample time showing you that Matt Murdock is a tortured man, the kind of guy you can believe would wear a costume and spend his nights beating the living snot out of criminals. He's emotionally distant, has a lot of guilt about what he does, second guesses himself and is very angry on the inside. He's a lawyer that encounters the worst people imaginable every day and he's fed up with seeing the ones who have the right connections or enough muscle to intimidate witnesses worm their way out of an appropriate sentence. What I liked even more was that you can also see that there are moments where he is a nice guy and he isn't always moping around complaining about that one person he couldn't save. He tells jokes, he flirts with women and has friends. You get to see him as a regular guy that takes advantage of his powers but also feels the burden of them. One of my favorite scenes happens just as he's about to call it a night after getting into a vicious fight with a dozen thugs. He is about to lie down when he hears the screams of a woman being murdered. He perks up a bit, then looks discouraged. He knows there's nothing he can do, and if he went out in the exhausted state that he is, he would only get himself killed. It's a difficult thing to do, but he must go to bed and try to let it slide, for now. That scene, with the clever detail that the man sleeps in a sense deprivation tank in order to get some peace and quiet really impressed me. That single moment speaks volumes about the character and that's a sign that this is a legitimately good movie, one that's been unjustly dismissed.When it comes to the supporting characters there's a lot to like. First up our main villain, Bullseye. What I like about this guy is that they make him delightfully evil. He's a sociopath that kills people in increasingly difficult ways... because it's a way for him to get his jollies. He doesn't use guns. Those are for your run-of-the-mill assassins. This guy's weapons of choice will make you look at pencils, toothpicks and office supplies in a totally different way. I also enjoyed the fact that he's given a real character. He's full of himself and very proud of his skills, to a fault. He also appears to suffer from some sort of OCD because he's always being overly theatrical and boastful, but in a way that's believable (unlike say, Two-Face from ""Batman Forever""). I liked seeing Jennifer Garner as Elektra. There's real chemistry between her and Murdock and she's not just some damsel in distress that needs to be rescued during the climax. She's got a lot of different facets to her personality. The last guy I want to talk about is Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin. I know traditionally he's a really fat white guy but I actually like him better here than anywhere else. This Wilson Fisk is a powerful presence. He's scary, but not in an obvious way that would have every single person in New York screaming ""that's the bad guy! Right there!"" Only two things really bother about this movie. There isn't enough action because there are so many moments where the characters and their relationships are explored and like most of the 2000's superhero films, many scenes contain dated CGI that makes you wish they were using practical effects, or just had more realistic battles that could actually have been done with the actors. The other is that the film is just a tad too long. I can forgive both because it really is an entertaining film filled with interesting characters and complex relationships, but it's worth noting.If you think that ""Daredevil"" is a bad movie, you just need to revisit it by watching the Director's Cut. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the drama and how well developed all of the characters are. It captures the spirit of the dark Marvel comic books that made this guy a favorite in the first place. (On Blu-ray, March 26, 2015)",Daredevil
132,Mr Parker,33%,4,4 August 2003,"That's the amount of this movie that is actually watchable. Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock hits his mark less than half of the time. I liked him at times and then I wanted to strangle him when his smug off-camera persona came on, which was fairly often. I couldn't help feeling that this movie was rushed. The main factor that makes me believe this is that the CG scenes of Daredevil doing his thing look like just that: CG. It's kind of disappointing to see such a half-assed effort done on the main character himself. It's as bad as Spider-Man's character effects, if not worse. I thought the beginning scenes were really well done and I always like seeing David Keith in something, who plays Matt's boxer father here. Jennifer Garner was okay and I STRESS okay. Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin is great casting but ultimately ends up being underused. I remember seeing the Kingpin in the comics and feeling a sense of dread whenever he arrived. Here, Duncan isn't too menacing and it's obvious that his role was just underdeveloped. Colin Farrell as Bullseye chews up the scenery like a hamster at a litter convention and makes little apology for it. In fact, if he screamed a lot, the role could have easily been played by Al Pacino. Colin was actually the most impressive of the entire cast, come to think of it. He brought this weird mania to the whole thing. The action was chaotic as expected but a little too chaotic at times. The one-on-one fight scenes lacked in that the choreography was too obvious (especially the Affleck/ Garner fights). It kind of sucks when you see actors setting up for their opponent's next move a little too far in advance because it effectively kills whatever feelings of spontaneity you're supposed to get. I know that these people aren't exactly Kung-Fu gods but I guess I just wanted to see something a little more impressive. The wire work in the movie was painfully obvious as well and took away whatever suspension of disbelief I had set aside for watching the movie. I ragged on the special effects before but there's one thing that I found extremely noteworthy. The way that they handled Daredevil's radar sight was really cool. It's tough to explain but you'll have to see it for yourself. Also, the sound design for the movie was really well done and it gives you a good idea of the kind of world that Daredevil lives in. With the proper surround set up, you're definitely in for a nice aural treat if you listen for that kind of stuff. It's too bad that the rest of the movie wasn't this inventive. I think with a little more time in production, this movie could've been great but as it stands, it suffers from being a rush job. It was nice to see that there was an obvious respect for the entire Daredevil mythos and they managed to fit a bunch of the regular characters in small supporting roles. Maybe a sequel will tighten things up a little but I wouldn't count on a franchise at this point unless Frank Miller adapts his own ""Born Again"" storyline for the next picture. If you don't know what I speak of, hunt it down at your local comic book store, they should have it in a collected volume. It's the storyline that made me a Daredevil fan in the first place.RATING: ** out of *****.",Daredevil
133,thenolanfan,Trash but not the worst,5,9 February 2020,"The worst about this movie is the film editing and the acting.First, the film editor, an the director showed trash footage that have absolutely no utility on the movie, but I get what they were trying to do. However, I rate movie about the result and not the intention which i feel was more noble than in the recent productions of Marvel. I think that of all the early trash Marvel movie this one is the more accessible to someone who as no idea of that era.Second, Ben Affleck is simply not good in superhero movie, he doesn't capture the essence of comic book, he is acting too dark that's all.It is with all the most noble intentions that, I my regret, I have to rate it 5/10",Daredevil
134,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,very underrated,7,15 October 2005,"I personally thought this film portrayed the darkness of the comic books very, very well. Ben Affleck's performance as the Daredevil Matt Murdock is believable, but he does get too dramatic in scenes where it really isn't required. As much as people don't want to believe it, this movie works with the pretty boys Affleck and Colin Farrell as the secondary villain, a sharpshooting hit-man named Bullseye. They really hate each other (laughs). Jennifer Garner as the very sexy heiress Elektra Nachios saves this movie from being a 5/10 instead of an 8/10. She is such a likable character and does an excellent job of playing the powerful yet vulnerable Elektra. She is great at being a woman who wants to be with her man, yet has her priorities. The main villain is the very evil Kingpin, headed by a great Michael Clarke Duncan. Duncan shows his brute force near the end of the movie. All throughout, these 4 A and B list actors are flanked by a great supporting cast including Joe Pantoliano as an investigative reporter who later becomes of aid to the Daredevil, Leland Orser as the Kingpin's right hand man Wesley, and Jon Favreau as Murdock's best friend and colleague. Favreau is mostly comic relief, but the first two characters played by Pantoliano and Orser are serious characters. All in all this is a good movie, not great, good. The cast does a much better job than most people believed they would, and Jennifer Garner owns the film. It's a shame no sequel has been announced, because it would be a great film as well. The darkness of this movie can be felt all throughout, with the great villainous work of Duncan and Farrell, and the mood of Affleck and Garner. 7/10",Daredevil
135,tributarystu,Which is next?,4,1 April 2003,"I try to have a clear image of everything at first. I try to understand. I try to perceive. I try to interpret. I try to decide. I try quite a lot, don't I? That's the difference between me and...this.I doubt anyone can expect much from such a movie. I did not. A story as dry and dull as a story could get. Personally, I can't understand why make more than one, maximum two comic books. They're all the same. As is Daredevil. The one thing I regret at this moment is that I can not truly compare the comic books, but I can compare, for example, Daredevil and Spiderman...as movies.Several SPOILERSThe story...so well known...child suffers ""an accident"", gets powers, loses parents, wants revenge...becomes a member of society, and works as a lawyer, so he can do justice when justice is not done. It's usually the problem if the super hero really is the ""good guy"" or not. This appears as a quite big issue in Daredevil, but the way things work out...are more than predictable. The ending, a little bit open, does hint a future sequel, about which I am not so thrilled. Money is money though, and you have to do everything to get it.Back to Daredevil. To the...characters. The movie can be fun at times, most of the ""jokes"" having to do with the fact that our hero is blind. Ben Affleck...yes, Ben Affleck. Was his the right choice for this movie? I can hardly say. I don't think he was, but I don't think he is the one to blame for what this film ends up being. There's nothing an actor could've done to make it better. My personal favorite is Bullseye, a guy as mean and as ""cool"" as a villain can be. His so sadistic in his behavior, and feels absolutely no remorse. Of course, his exaggerated sadism leads to his death, but it's not that one wouldn't have expected this. I also liked Kingpin. Casting Michael Clarke Duncan in his role was one of the best things this movie brought. His size gives him an authority rarely encountered before, but he is merely the one behind all things. It doesn't mean that he is the strongest. It never does...though it too often is. The final showdown between Daredevil and Kingpin is quite lacking ""the feeling"" such a showdown would need. There was something that bothered me with Kingpin too...he just didn't seem too much of a bad guy. Maybe Duncan can't be as mean as he looks... Elektra was a lame as a character in a comic book could get. Her fight with Daredevil seemed pathetic and of course her end was the same way: pathetic. She was just the ""bit"" of love each of these movies needs.
To the more technical things...the most interesting probably was the ""radar"". It was a cool visual effect, though sometimes a little too confusing. Still it brought a special ""something"" to the film...too little, unfortunately. I can't recall anything else that stunned me.As a comparison with Spider-Man...I found Spidey pretty disappointing, but not as bad as Daredevil. Spiderman just has his charm...its not much special about him, but I think I preferred him because I had heard of Spider-Man until the movie. Can't say the same thing about Daredevil. Tobey Maguire was more interesting than Affleck, but I just felt too far away from the story in both films. The Goblin in Spiderman can hardly be compared with Bullseye or Kingpin. In a way, Daradevil wins a point here: both Bullseye and Kingpin are more believable than The Goblin. Anyway, my favorite remains Batman. He just ain't the same like all the rest...and, most important, he appeared at the beginning of all these comic books things, so he's still got some originality in him. On the other hand, Spider-Man and Daredevil don't. Superman, the pioneer you might say, is also much more interesting than these two.On the whole the movie might be worth a... 5.5/10",Daredevil
136,TheHande,Darker than most Marvels,8,9 March 2007,"With comic-book movies the tone of the film tells a lot. Daredevil sets a tone not found in other Marvel Movies and in that it succeeds in creating something very intriguing. The moral ambiguity of this 'super hero flick' is unlike anything else seen before.The movie undoubtedly has some mainstream sensibilities in mind, especially with its fight-scenes, but these are merely living up to what is expected of most post-Matrix action films. What's nice is that it doesn't derail the film's story. The ending unfortunately leaves something of a sour taste, but with a setting such as this you're unfortunately left with one of two clichés and I think over-all Daredevil took the right route.The darkness of the film also leaves room for Collin Farrel's darkly comic character of Bullseye. The only hitch in this wonderful film is that it does not quite live up to the larger than life Marvel films like X-Men and Hulk. It however, makes a brilliant effort and is recommendable for that alone.",Daredevil
137,Shiva-11,I dare you to pay full price!,5,7 February 2003,"Back in the dark ages BT  (Before Television), when kids walked ten miles uphill both ways to school there were limited entertainment options. One of the cheapest avenues of escape was the comic book:  often crudely drawn, with simple storylines they provided a  pleasant diversion without all that pesky reading. Their success continued on the small screen - who could forget the campy 60's Batman with its ubiquitous Biffs! and Kapows! - but their transition to the big screen was definitely hit or miss.  While comic to screen films like Batman did boffo box office they spawned a legion of comic megabombs like Howard the Duck and The Punisher, and superheroes dropped off the studios' radar. It would take more than a decade for the quirky X-Men to rejuvenate the genre, and inspire A-list actors and directors to jump back on the bandwagon.When a freak accident robbed Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) of his sight it also enhanced his remaining senses and allowed him to `see' in a whole new way. A lawyer by trade, Murdock  lives a dual life, defending the disadvantaged, and in the guise of DareDevil, meting out his own brand of justice for those thugs that live beyond the reach of the law.  His solitary existence is shattered when he meets the beautiful Elektra a strong willed kindred spirit with a secret.  Alas, hero bliss is usually short-lived.Daredevil is a unique character in the comic universe, as he possesses neither classical superpowers (he can't fly or change shape) nor is he a reclusive billionaire who can buy all kinds of really cool gadgets. He also doesn't fit in the everyman category as he belongs to a group that is classically considered disadvantaged.  I believe it is these very distinctions that led to his tenure as a hero, because readers find it much easier to relate to his character.  Luckily Daredevil won't be seeing this movie anytime soon.Fleshing out a comic book character onscreen is a delicate balancing act between humor and drama  - stray too far in either direction and what you're left with is parody .Ben Affleck often pegged as Hollywood's next big leading man, plays Murdock with soft-spoken amiability, providing  a character that audiences will easily accept.  If only he devoted the same attention to the character's alter ego.  Every time Affleck dons the mask he slips into melodrama delivering his lines with such overblown self-importance and mock menace that they simply fall flat - several serious scenes spawned outbursts of laughter.  The supporting cast offers equally mixed performances.Jennifer Garner is disarming as the beautiful Elektra, simultaneously delicate and deadly.  Garner demonstrates remarkable screen presence which begs the question why wasn't her character more thoroughly developed?  If we knew a little more about Elektra it would have given some much needed balance to the story.  Instead, Electra is essentially reduced to window dressing.  Pity.  This also extends to the big villain of the piece: in spite of his menacing physical presence, Michael Clarke Duncan is tepid as Kingpin, hampered both by poor writing and pedestrian delivery. Audiences are supposed to hate the bad guy.  The most I could muster was apathy. Mercifully Colin Farrell rises to the challenge as Bullseye, the maniacal Irish hitman who can turn anything into a weapon.  Farrell's over the top portrayal  also helps to infuse the film with some intentionally humorous moments (his mini tantrum elicited ongoing laughter from those who could decipher his thick brogue).I could dwell at length on the noticeable plot gaps (like how is it that a blind orphan would develop preternatural acrobatic abilities and fighting skills with no training?), the dark setting, or the none too subtle ironies (Daredevil seeking refuge in a church), - but let's be honest, no one's going for the story.  Thankfully there are several well choreographed fight sequences (courtesy of Cheung Yan Yuen of Matrix fame) to help distract the viewer from these piddling details.  Although Affleck noticeably stumbles a few times, Garner's movements are virtually flawless, no doubt honed during her time on Alias.  Nothing like a leather clad bombshell kicking butt to keep you mesmerized (works for me anyways).  Mix in some above average (and sparingly used) fluid  CGI for added eye candy, an energetic soundtrack, and a few comic creator cameos and you're left with a mediocre watchable popcorn flick.  Just don't hold your breath for the sequel.",Daredevil
138,ldavis-2,I Dare You!,2,30 July 2003,"It's irresponsible for studios to target PG-13 flicks toward kids because there's lots of action. Despite some funny moments, this was very dark and violent, not for the munchkins.Duncan was all wrong for Kingpin. He's a great, big teddy bear who couldn't strike fear into the heart of Mr. Jingles. Hence, Kingpin comes off as your standard-issue baddie instead of the chilling, brilliant strategist he is in the comic. Farrell, who really needs to get over himself, was over-the-top as Bullseye.Affleck and Garner had zero chemistry. She lacks Elektra's dangerous edge, and he doesn't have the range to play the troubled Matt. However, they are yummy to look at when the rain pours down on them.How did Matt create Daredevil or afford his posh digs and cool costumes/gadgets on a pro-bono salary? Heck if I know. But what really bothered me is that is Daredevil almost-blasé about who lives and who dies. In the comic, DD does not kill, but, here, he kills and lets others be killed. So when he spares Kingpin, after making some speech on the evils of seeking vengeance, it was totally disingenuous as well as an obvious set-up for a sequel.",Daredevil
139,gritfrombray-1,Not terrible.........,6,15 April 2007,"Am a big super hero fan and particularly of Marvel ones, Daredevil in particular, and when I read there was going to be a Daredevil film I was excited. When I saw the cast I frowned as I'm not a big Ben Affleck fan. Finally the film was out and I went along with my bro. I was right in not trusting the casting of Ben Affleck. He is too heavy for the part. Never did I remember Matt Murdock's eyes being gray when we saw them either. Michael Clarke Duncan was good as Kingpin but... wasn't he supposed to be some big fat white guy?? Colin Farrell was surprisingly good as Bullseye and the story was good however. Saw 'Trial Of The Incredible Hulk' recently which featured Daredevil played by Rex Smith who was tall, slender and was believably blind. And, more importantly wore a black costume as Daredevil did in his original guise. In all a not altogether terrible movie but a little more research into Daredevil would have made this a far better movie.........",Daredevil
140,willrams,Dark-side of Humanity,7,3 March 2003,"""The Man Without Fear"", Daredevil, the masked avenger who combats injustices of Hell's Kitchen, New York City, played by Ben Affleck, is really the super-human masked man as compared to his regular job as an attorney in the courtroom.  It all happened because the bad men killed the only people he loved; his girlfriend and his father, and he became blinded by acid.  This production I found much heavier and more intense, and mostly on the dark-side of humanity as shown by night scenes.  The music and stereo are great, but I found some  scenes of New York City were too fabricated.  This film has no comparison to ""Spiderman"" which I loved very much.  This film is too heavy for youngsters.",Daredevil
141,son_of_cheese_messiah,"Too much plot, too little development",2,14 November 2009,"One of the worst comic book adaptations I've seen only slightly above the unwatchable Hulk monstrosity. Reasons: 1. Pretentiousness. This film never uses straight forward shots when posy ones are better. Consequently we get endless amounts of pointless 'artistic' cuts which are more annoying than anything else.2. Sadism. The comic hero is motivated by a desire to bring felons to justice, this version is a cold blooded murderer. His nemesis Bullseye also horrifically kills people for pleasure, although more justifiable by the nature of the character, the scene where he murders a boring Granny, played for laughs, is in poor taste.3. Too much plot. The story tries hard to cram in key moments from Daredevil's long history, his creation, the introduction of Bullyseye, the Kingpin, Elektra, the death of her father, her meeting with and her subsequent love affair with Matt and hatred of Daredevil etc... As a result, everything seems rushed through with very little time for character development or time to register the emotional impact of each episode. The dialogue suffers because of this with the characters given to talking in cliché-ridden sound-bites like ""stay with me"" over and over.4. Music. Partly I guess to hide the lack of characterisation but also to give it a trendy teen pop video feel, there are musical interludes every 5 minutes which add to the disjointed nature of this. Mostly they are annoying shouty metal tracks but a ""tender"" Clannad-type Celtic tune is added to the scene of Elektra's father's funeral. Sometimes this is unintentionally humorous like the scene when the Irish Bullseye first appears to rappers singing ""top o' the mornin'"".Awful.2/10",Daredevil
142,BigGuy,Poor compared to recent comic fare,4,14 February 2003,"This movie was exceedingly flat and lacking in pace.  It also falls victim to the recent trend in action movies of obscuring the action as much as possible.  Shaky camera, flashing lights and too tight zooms are the trademarks of this unforgiveable style.  How about this, hire stars who can actually fight, or at least look like they are doing the fighting themselves.  This is especially true of the leading character.I never read the Daredevil comics, so I can't say how bad the casting is as far as accuracy to the characters.  But I can say that the supporting characters were much more enjoyable than the main ones.  Jennifer Garner and Collin Farrel I thought did well in their roles.  Michael Clarke Duncan was well cast, although he gave a slightly flat performance.The story was pretty flat as well.  The story just kind of jumps into there being a conflict between Kingpen and Daredevil.  There isn't a buildup it just is there.  Yeah there is some backstory, but it explains, it doesn't create.  Along with unwatchable action scenes, I hate having a romance shoehorned into an action movie.6/10",Daredevil

144,ilovedolby,"The bottom line folks, is that we've been here and we've don't that!",6,16 February 2003,"Daredevil is the long awaited film adaptation of the famous comic book from Marvel Comics. It joins the ranks of other comic book adapted films that have hit screens over the past years: namely Batman, Spider-Man, X-Men, and Spawn. What do you get when you combine every comic book adapted movie into a single film? The answer is Daredevil. Daredevil, for the most part, is just the same rehashed superhero shtick that we've seen several times over in the past years. Does that make it a bad movie? Not necessarily, but it doesn't make it a great one, either. There are two problems here than any layman could propose. For one, perhaps Daredevil was converted into a movie after all the other really great comic book superhero films were made. That's debatable, I guess. I wonder how different Daredevil would be if it had been made during the mid-1990s? By that rationale, maybe it wouldn't seem to have been just a rehashed superhero flick. Second, Daredevil is not only just a rehash of everything we've seen before in superhero flicks, but it seems to literally feel like them too. I attended this film with a friend and we could easily point out where the films visual affects had been seen before. For example, a shot of Daredevil jumping off a building and the camera staying close behind him, that was Batman Forever. Second, scenes of Daredevil swinging around through the air are obviously reminiscent of Spider-Man. I wouldn't go so far as to call Daredevil a rip-off of these other superhero flicks, but it sure isn't original. Daredevil is the story of a blind man who fights to avenge his father's death. Boy, if I had $10 every time I've seen that scenario in a film, I'd be as rich as the good people over at Twentieth-Century Fox! Daredevil is undeniably a box-office hit with early weekend estimates showing it making $43.5 million in its first three days of ticket sales. This film will easily climb the box-office chart to earn over $100 million in probably just over a week, or two. Nonetheless, the film's apparent success can be contributed to the box-office drawing power of Ben Affleck. Affleck is a really versatile actor. By that, I mean he can give a superb performance like in Good Will Hunting, then turn around and do a crappy performance in a film like Pearl Harbor. But Affleck has part of the Austin Powers curse in that women do want him, but I don't think that many guys want to be him. Perhaps, beat him? Ha, ha! Ben Affleck isn't the only real box-office draw to this film, although he is the primary. Daredevil also stars the radiant Jennifer Garner, who recently was seen in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. Her very entrance is just as intoxicating to the eye as when audiences first saw Ursula Andress on the big screen in the 1962 James Bond flick, Dr. No. She has a few good moves in this film, kicking some butt here and there.I have to point out Daredevil's psychotic Irish hit man, Bullseye, played by Colin Farrell. Farrell is becoming somewhat of a box-office sensation these days. He appeared in Steven Spielberg's Minority Report last summer. And you can see Farrell is the recently released spy flick, The Recruit, also starring Al Pacino. Look for Farrell is the upcoming suspense flick, Phone Booth, due out in April. Among other talented actors in Daredevil are Michael Clark Duncan as the Kingpin, Joe Pantoliano as the journalist Ben Urich, and Jon Favreau who adds a sense of wit to the whole production. Favreau steals every seen he is in. The bottom line folks, is that we've been here and we've don't that! Daredevil actually met my expectations, which weren't too high to begin with. It's okay if you are looking for the same basic superhero/comic book film that we've seen in the past years. It's not as good as Spider-Man, though. Spider-Man was down right fun, exciting, and clean entertainment that both kids and adults could marvel at. However, Daredevil proves to be a little too violent at times. This can be attributed to Colin Farrell's character Bullseye, whose brand of killing involves the use of any kind of really sharp object. Nonetheless, I think the idea of converting comic books into motion pictures is a good idea. But maybe it's time to give the whole superhero genre a little break. There's more to comic books than just superheroes. I'll bet many of you didn't know that Road To Perdition, one of last year's finest films was actually a graphic novel before it became a movie. But as for Daredevil, just watch Spider-Man again. **1/2",Daredevil

147,jdollak,Theatrical is passable. Director's cut is considerably better.,8,3 November 2008,"I am much more of a Spider-Man fan than a Daredevil fan. I've a vast majority of Spider-Man comics, compared to a fairly pathetic five issues of Daredevil. So when I saw the original cut of Daredevil, I enjoyed it, although it seemed a little unbalanced. The tone changed up quickly between some campy sequences (the park fight) to some darker tones (Bullseye killing Electra's father) and some really silly romantic scenes. Despite these obvious flaws, I enjoyed the movie. Not enough to buy it. I recently picked up the first volume of Marvel Essential for Daredevil. Being familiar with how goofy that comic was at first, and being aware of the change in tone for the series after Kingpin was brought in... the movie makes more sense. So I watched the director's cut. I knew it included a subplot that had been cut. But I wouldn't even consider it a subplot. It's got some information that makes the movie make a whole lot more sense. It makes the whole movie feel more like a story, and less like a collection of events. There's substantial character development that had been trimmed out. Foggy is more of a person, less of a comic relief. Daredevil is more conflicted.I'd advise watching the original cut only for educational purposes. It shows how it's possible to cut up a movie like this and make it into a pale imitation of what it was.There is one considerable problem that really drags this movie down. The soundtrack. There's way too much of an effort to use a rock soundtrack. If about 90% of that music was removed, and replaced with an appropriate score, the movie would be a whole lot better.",Daredevil

Otherwise stay away!",Daredevil
149,extravaluejotter,DullDevil,1,28 April 2006,"Poor old Ben Affleck. There was a time in the mid-to-late 90s when he appeared in some great movies. Ever since ""Pearl Harbour"", however, his star has waned somewhat. I wouldn't say that ""DareDevil"" is the worst movie he's ever been in but there's not much to recommend it. Affleck himself does quite a good job of portraying the blind lawyer/costumed crime-fighter who 'sees' through his highly-developed (via the obligatory comic-book accident involving dodgy chemicals) sense of hearing. Unfortunately he's let down by his co-stars, Jennifer Garner and Colin Farrell. Garner gives a wooden performance as Elektra, rendering the corset-clad martial arts minx about as sexily as a wardrobe. She must have been taking lessons from Kate ""Plank"" Beckinsale (Affleck's equally wooden co-star in ""Pearl Harbour"") as she pouts and strops her way through the movie like a moody teenager. Despite the fact that Garner and Affleck apparently fell in love during the course of filming ""DareDevil"", their love scenes when in character are unconvincing.Which brings us nicely to Colin Farrell as Bullseye. Farrell clearly thinks that he's been given a part in one of the Joel Schumacher-directed Batman films and plays his villain as an over-the-top Saturday morning children's TV character. He is about as threatening and scary as a glove puppet with a balloon on a stick. It's as if he's got lost and wandered in from the set of another movie. Didn't anyone notice?There was some sort of pedestrian revenge plot in the movie, but I was rendered so slack-jawed by its overall mediocrity that I can't remember all the 'intricacies' any more. The crowning insult for me was the scene where DareDevil runs headlong at Bullseye, who is riding a motorcycle. Our hero then leaps into the air, lands on the bike and kicks the villain off it. (A) the action is pretty obviously CGI and (B) it's a frame-for-frame rip-off of a sequence from Katsuhiro Otomo's 1988 anime movie ""Akira"". A tip to director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson: You don't have to think originally to make a good movie but sometimes it helps.",Daredevil
150,sam_smithreview,Super Hero movies are not always great,5,5 May 2016,"Mat Murdock is an attorney who has been blind since an accident as a child. However at night he is DareDevil – a superhero of sorts who fights crime in his local Hell's Kitchen. His blindness has given him raised senses and he has trained his body to fight. He meets and falls in love with Elektra only to find himself caught in a deadly game when her father is murdered by crime lord King Pin's assassin Bulls-eye.The actual plot is very simple and seems very short – the usual 'setting up' stuff takes half the film and the rest is quite run of the mill stuff indeed. Like I said, it doesn't do anything specific wrong but it feels quite lackluster. Every film this summer seems to have random fight scenes but the ones in DD are even more random than ever – while the fight in the kids park is good to watch, it comes out of nowhere and is just a little silly!There are a lot facial close ups. The visual style is aggressively painful. How they visualized Daredevil's special vision isn't much better. It's all blue and wavy. If it's supposed to give him superior visual skills, it doesn't look like it on the screen. The production value looks cheap.",Daredevil

Well, till Bullseye showed (Collin Farell) I fell nearly a sleep because of a lame story showing a guy who wants to be a batman. Oh and since it's a Hollywood production he meets a beautiful Electra (Jennifer Garner) and fell in love. A love without chemistry. And yes, they fight against evil. Hmmm, who would guess... Since the script looks like it was written by 12 year old, this movie sure look like ,it was made for kids. Well done Hollywood, no nude scenes and a lot of violence. Great combination.

My god who thought they were making a good movie when they released this one.  The acting is horrible, the dialogue painful, the editing ridiculous, the directing ridiculous, the effects unforgivable. It's quite rare for a superhero flick to reach such depths of depravity. The chemistry between Jenifer Garner and Ben Affleck is laughable and so are the performances. And the villains oh god they seem to be hamming it up with the addition of each new scene and yes it gets worse as it goes along.  I feel like I've bashed the film a little too much because I enjoyed it. It goes down in the history of enjoyably bad flix. But theres a limit with this one. And theres only so much you can take.. And now I've heard theres a sequel and a spinoff film. hopefully by different people.  You can't blame it all on the actors because both Affleck and Garner and Farrell have shown promise. And I'm sure they did this one for the paychecks. And it's not beacuse I don't like the daredevil charachter or the story but when it's delivered onto the screen like overcaked plastic popcorn theres a limit too what I and the audience can take.",Daredevil

The action was a little bit too quick for my eyes, the costumes were a little too sado maso for me. The director tried to imitate the Tim Burton Batman atmosphere and was successful - but only to the extent that many scenes were pretty dark, so dark you could only guess what was happening.So what remains? A decent action movie which is quite brutal at times, still worth watching if you like Superhero movies. But nothing compared to X-Men and Spiderman. A pity.",Daredevil

The movie critic in me saw so much wasted source potential, cheesy fight scenes, and some really bad dialogue.  This could have been the best comic book movie out there, but it is just not.

160,JPfanatic93,Not Marvel's finest hour,6,23 September 2013,"One of the poorest of Marvel Comics adaptations, though still an entertaining action flick. As a kid, Matt Murdock comes into contact with toxic waste that blinds him for life but heightens all his other senses, including his need for justice. When his father is murdered by the mob, he makes it his life's cause to fight crime, by day as a lawyer, by night as the vigilante Daredevil who prowls the streets of New York in a red leather suit and beats up bad guys. This gets him on the radar of mob boss Kingpin (the huge Michael Clarke Duncan (R.I.P. 2012) is perfectly suited for the part, except the tone of his skin is not in sync with the original comic book character, but with such a neat actor, who cares?) and his crazed assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrell) who is ordered to give the Devil his due. Poor Matt also has to deal with the beautiful but deadly Elektra Natchios, a girl he has fallen in love with but who believes his alter ego to be her father's killer. Plenty of interesting characters and an abundance of solid action scenes cannot fully make up for the pale shadow this movie grew to be compared to Marvel franchises like Spider-Man or X-Men at that time. Most of the blame can be assigned to Ben Affleck, who just does a terrible job at making his character a compellingly blind guy tortured by remorse and anger over his father's demise and driven by a relentless need to avenge crime. Similarly, the romance with Elektra feels contrived and is never exposed as much as it needs to be to come over as believable or something the audience needs to care about, despite the dire consequences in store for this supposed passion. At least Kingpin feels like a true menace, while Bullseye is just a delightful amoral and wicked person Farrell plays with apparent appropriate enthusiasm. The Director's Cut, running a good half hour longer than its theatrical counterpart, is the preferred version to watch, adding more depth to the characters and a few more subplots to flesh out the whole, but it cannot compensate for Affleck's feeble performance. Marvel movies hit their lowest ebb with Daredevil's spin-off flick Elektra (2005), which was released as a direct-to-DVD feature in many territories and destroyed the femme fatale character even more eagerly. Director Johnson was responsible for a second disappointing Marvel adaptation with Ghost Rider in 2007.",Daredevil
161,TheMovieDoctorful,"Ignore The Bandwagon, Take The Dare On the Director's Cut",10,5 November 2018,"I'm structuring my review for this film a bit differently, simply because this may be one of the most unfairly maligned films I've ever watched. I'm sure there are valid reasons to dislike it, but I'll be damned if I've come across any. Especially on the internet. For my money, Daredevil: Director's Cut is the 3rd best Marvel comics movie to date and the 2nd best not associated with Spider-Man. I'm aware of the rather shallow ""criticisms"" against it, so allow me to address them.Reason #1: ""Ben Affleck sucks as Daredevil.""So many critics of the film are quick to bash Affleck's performance as The Man Without Fear, yet I have yet to see any of them give any specific reasons or evidence as to why his performance is supposedly ""bad."" The closest people manage to muster up is that he just doesn't fit the role, but they don't tend to give any actual reasons why. Personally, I loved him in the role (Albeit not as much as Charlie Cox) He was convincingly intimidating, brooding and commanding screen presence as Daredevil, affably dorky, charming and emotionally vulnerable as Matt Murdock, and did a very nuanced and three-dimensional job in his facial acting portraying a man trying to cling on to what little hope he has left; for himself, for the people he cares about and for his city.Reason #2: ""It's too edgy and dark and brooding.""Oh, I'm sorry. Were you looking for a more light hearted and playful story about a man who's lost his most primary sense working a high-stress job with lives at stake by day and fighting crime in the most dangerous neighborhood in New York by night, constantly losing everyone he loves to violent deaths at the hands of serial killers, assassins and gangsters? Not every comic book film can or should be Spider-Man (Which, by the way, came out around the same time as Daredevil, set a standard for the genre and wasn't dark and brooding at all.)Reason #3: ""Daredevil shouldn't kill.""This is one of my favorite aspects of the film, actually. Director and Screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson recognized that Daredevil shouldn't kill, but handled this aspect in an extremely thoughtful way. Rather than merely having him as a stalwart, moral Crusader through the film's entirety, Johnson goes back to the character's roots as a tortured Catholic to give us a story of redemption. Daredevil begins the film as a killer, but as he slowly watches himself grow into the very bully that motivated him to take up the mask, as he watches the only woman he's ever loved lose her sanity and life in the quest for revenge, he goes through an arc where he must question his own ethics. When he spares Kingpin in the end, he's finally earned the right to say the line ""I'm not the bad guy."" Making Daredevil's ""no kill"" rule be the conclusion of a character arc both respects the religious themes of its source material while also adding something new.Reason #4: ""Elektra is a bad character with a bad performance from Garner.""Jennifer Garner leaned very hard on the more human part of Elektra, which is something I enjoyed. People forget that Elektra and Matt were close friends long before they crossed weapons. Her entire arc in the original Miller run is being a good person who is quickly corrupted and destroyed by her desire for vengeance. Garner captures that impulsive, radical shift wonderfully; she nails both her initial sweetness and charisma as well as her spitting anger and fury. Also, whatever faults Garner's Elektra had are peanuts compared to Elodie ""Being seductive is my entire acting range"" Yung's horrendous version of Elektra, which fails on every conceivable front in both a writing and acting department.Reason #5: ""The playground scene.""I unironically love this scene, though only in the Director's Cut. For context, these are both two lonely, emotionally damaged people without any escape. They meet each other in the park, playfully flirt in their own unique, martial style and take their skills normally used for violence as a way of light hearted flirting. This scene sets up false hope that maybe these two might brighten up each others lives and bring levity into them. However, in the Director's Cut, their relationship only grows more toxic for both parties. Matt abandons Elektra in the rain in her time of emotional need, her father is killed on their night of reconciliation and Daredevil is believed possible. This leads to their fight on the rooftop, a violent, gritty, emotional polar opposite to their fight on the playground that even recreates the former's choreography. What may look like a campy, goofy scene on the surface actually sets the stage for a rather tragic and doomed romance.Reason #6: ""The soundtrack.""Spider-Man's theme song is sung by Chad Kroeger. Your argument is invalid. Also, memes aside, Evanescence still rocks, I don't care.What else does the film have in term of merits? A compelling balance of legal/crime drama and superhero action, an outstanding performance from Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin, a rather unique ""underdog"" story of a lower class little guy going up against the criminal tyrant of Hell's Kitchen, some really inventive, comic book-ish directing, gorgeous cinematography that looks like it leaped off the page of a Frank Miller comic, genuine emotional weight and high stakes despite not being a ""save the world""-style comic book film and excellent fights that really capture the street level appeal of the character.The film admittedly isn't perfect. Colin Farrell as Bullseye is rather obnoxious and only really convincing in one scene. Apart from his performance, however, I genuinely don't understand the hate that it's gotten over the years. The Director's Cut is one of the best superhero films to date and I highly recommend it to those only aware of the story-devoid Theatrical Edition.",Daredevil
162,K-Slicer,Marvel's Answer To Batman,10,5 March 2003,"Four days and few user comments ago, I came to my own conclusion about ""Daredevil"".  He may be extremely liberal and hell-bent on p***ing both the establishment and the underworld off but it didn't stop me from finding it to be an intensely enjoyable ride (It's kind of like telling a person who is obsessed with eating hot dogs the actual contents of a hot dog and that person still consumes them with the same ravenous intensity).  Maybe it's my fatal flaw to love almost every movie I watch but I really liked both ""Daredevil"" and ""Spider-Man"". (Is that allowed?  Can I like two movies that are ideologically different?).  That is me I guess and I can't deny the fact that I am a blanket movie fiend.Besides that, here are my reasons for liking Daredevil (spoilers herein): (1) Jennifer Garner was an excellent choice for leading lady. (2) Despite some lacking talent in the action hero department, Ben Affleck did suprisingly well as Daredevil. (3) Colin Farrell can play a creepy individual with the best of them (watch ""Minority Report"" too).  (4) Michael Clarke Duncan has the best supporting role in my mind.  He has the talent for playing any sort of giant (kind or mean). (5) The fight scene in the church was worth 20% alone of the movie admission.  (6) The writing was exceptional.  A few of the scenes in the movies were thought out and written well. (7) I found some deep imagery in this film even though was probably not meant to be that way. (8) I love dark films about dark heroes (Batman, Ghost Dog, and Spawn are a couple other sweet dark hero films). (8) A blind man as a superhero is an intriguing concept. (9) The cinematography was intense and (10) the art direction was unreal.  10 reasons means a score of 10.A couple more thoughts.  In my mind, Daredevil is already on its way to being one of the more underrated films of the year.  I don't think it will ever eclipse the likes of ""Spiderman"" or ""Batman"" in box office draw or critical acclaim.  I do believe that it will go on to be a cult classic and a film that will be one of my underrated favorites.  It can't escape the shadow of either ""Spiderman"" or ""Batman"" but it is on a platform all its own.  Here ends my rant!",Daredevil
163,clydestuff,An average comic book film that just misses the mark,5,8 August 2003,"In an age when it seems as if there is a different comic book hero on the big screen every other month, 20th Century Fox in collaboration with Marvel brings us yet another super hero to gawk at.  With films like Batman and Spiderman setting the bar quite high, does Daredevil live up to great expectations?  Daredevil has a lot going for it.  It has a different kind of superhero in Daredevil/Matt Murdoch(Ben Affleck) who is blinded as a young boy by a chemical spill, but develops some kind of super sensory detection in his remaining senses.  He climbs like Spiderman, fights like Bruce Lee, and has a keen perception of everything going on around him.  As Matt Murdoch, the attorney, he tries to put criminals away legally during the day, but when the justice system fails, he wanders the streets at night as Daredevil to seek revenge and right all wrongs.  He doesn't care how he does it either as long as the job gets done.  Murdoch's Daredevil is a vigilante that makes Charles Bronson in Death Wish seem like milque toast.Early in the film, the background of how and why Murdoch becomes Daredevil, is played well, makes us sympathetic, and gives us enough of the story, without taking up too much of our time.  Later, Murdoch meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios(Jennifer Garner), and all their scenes together are interesting, including a scene when they fight each other, and a very touching moment when Elektra lets the rain fall on herself so that Murdoch is able to ""see"" her.On the flip side of the coin we have the villains, Bullseye(Colin Farrell)and The Kingpin(Michael Clarke Duncan).  Farrell is menacing enough as Bullseye, playing him as a Charles Manson on speed type of guy.  Duncan, is not quite as successful as The Kingpin. He's big and menacing but how can you hate him after The Green Mile?  Part of the fault here though is that of the screenplay, which never lets us in on what these two villains are all about.  In Batman, we knew why and how The Joker was as he was.  In Spiderman, we were given the history of The Green Goblin and it was an integral part of the story.  In Daredevil, Kingpin and Bullseye seem to pop up out of nowhere almost like some sort of jack-in-the-box.The musical score, if you dare call it that, was aimed strictly at the teenagers in the audience, is totally misguided and out of place.  It does nothing to compliment what is going on, and is there for the sole purpose of selling a few cd's.  The cinematography, is very dark and fits in well with the underlying themes that Daredevil is about.  The special effects are really good, and go a long way towards making us understand how The Daredevil perceives things around him.So what when wrong?  Alas, the blame has to be placed squarely on the shoulders of Ben Affleck.  I can't remember the last time I watched a film in which the main character gave such a one note performance.  It doesn't matter what emotion Daredevil is supposed to be showing on the screen, Ben Affleck basically portrays him as an emotionless being throughout.  His expressions never change for one minute.  I liked Ben Affleck in Bounce, and even in Pearl Harbor (which most people didn't), so maybe those were roles suited for him and this one wasn't.  Whatever the case may be, he never really stirs our emotions  enough to root for him as much as we should.The best reason to watch this film is Jennifer Garner as Elektra.  She is everything Affleck is not, and we care about her character every moment she is on the screen.  Her performance so overshadows Affleck when they are together, that you begin to wonder why they just didn't make the film about her.This could have been a great super-hero type film.  All the ingredients were there.  They just left out the seasoning.Till Next Time Next Class Please",Daredevil
164,stratus_phere,"No Fun, By the End you are Groaning",5,16 June 2017,"Hey, listen up, there are spoilers here! So DO NOT READ if you haven't seen it!I haven't seen the director's cut, but I can't imagine it could fix the problems I had with this movie.1) The female protagonist dies. I mean, WTF! How stupid is that? You like pissing the audience off? You want to kill a movie before the end? You don't want a viable sequel? Or you're just braindead? How could you make a movie like that?2) You keep all bad guys alive, for future use. This is one thing that always confounds me. Writers/directors who actually believe the idea of the ""super-human bad guy"", who always come back, is ridiculous and annoying. No, the audience does not want to see a bad guy who always gets away or who always survives, just so your protagonist has a villain in the sequels. Just kill the guy, for God's sake! We hate, and I mean we absolutely HATE that the heroes are forced to fight the same bad guys over, and over, and over, and over again in every movie the director/writer has planned in his tiny little pea-brain. If you can't plan a movie better than that, you have no business making movies. Find another career.3) After credits showing...not the female protagonist surviving, but the freaking bad guy. When the credits were rolling and they cut back to someone lying in a hospital bed, I was hoping beyond hope they had the sense to bring back the female lead, that she had somehow survived or been revived. But no, it was just one more cheap, p.o.s. shot to show the stupid bad guy...again. We get it, the bad guy will always survive, he will always get away and come back, for every planned sequel. How moronic. Why not give the audience what they wanted, instead of the tired old cliché of the villain coming back over and over again.Stupid.",Daredevil
165,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Disappointing, but not the worst comic book movie",5,24 July 2005,"This was pretty disappointing. Especially considering it was only released nine months after Spiderman, which was a great superhero movie. Ben Affleck's wooden acting does no justice to the movie, and the ending was disappointing. The story follows Matt Murdock. When he was a boy, he was blinded by toxic waste. This waste also enhanced his senses. When he grows up, he uses these enhanced senses to become a superhero known as Daredevil. Matt Murdock eventually becomes a target of Kingpin. A hit-man named Bullseye is hired by Kingpin to kill Daredevil. Matt Murdock's love interest, Elektra, becomes involved after Bullseye kills her father. She believes that Daredevil killed him. She is very unaware that Matt Murdock is Daredevil. Daredevil has an okay plot, but I still think it tries too hard to live up to Spiderman. This is a dark movie, and it does have a lot of action, with style, but it still failed to be a good movie. I would recommend this for someone who is a fan of superhero movies. While I didn't really like this movie, it is head and shoulders above The Hulk. However, if you want to watch a good superhero movie, watch Spiderman. You'll spend your time more wisely with that movie.",Daredevil
166,T-ZER0,"I like the Theatrical Cut, and Here's Why",9,2 August 2019,"I was able to catch Daredevil when it came on TV one day. Even though people slam it, I was drawn to the way they made the city and the action. What really made me like it was the level of emotion. Matt and Elektra's romance is what I liked the most. The fact that the Theatrical Cut has more scenes of them bonding is a win to me. The reason being is that superhero movies have action, this is true. But emotion is also where it's at. Superheroes are not gods, they are human after all. And Matt has had a lot of bad stuff happen to him, the fact that Elektra helped him with their relationship was very touching to me.Alright, now moving on. I really love the soundtrack on this movie. The rock music and the score by Graeme ReVell tells you. You're in Hell's Kitchen now, not your regular city, this is a whole lot tougher. Michael Clarke Duncan was able to portray a very scary Kingpin. He was believable to me because he's someone you really don't want to end up fighting one on one. He will break you, that's for sure.I like how they capitalized on Bullseye being able to use anything as a weapon particularly paper clips. One bonus of this film was Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's supposed romance on set and in life. Which ended because Affleck was an idiot anyway.I don't hate the Director's Cut. I just prefer this Cut more. The only thing I hated about the Director's Cut was less Matt and Elektra, and that horrible scene where Bullseye bit Elektra's lip when he killed her. To me that was disrespectful, not to the character, but to the story. Because Matt cared for her, and seeing her die like that to a psychopath is very sad.I will end my review by saying this. Affleck, if you're reading this. Suck it up man, several actors had to wear tighter superhero costumes than you. You're not alone. Stop being a baby.",Daredevil

168,SinjinSB,"I had hoped for a little better, but was pleased overall with the movie",7,16 February 2003,"I should start by saying I'm a fan of Daredevil comics. It's always a tricky thing bringing a story from the comics to the big screen. With the varied success of previous endeavors, you're never sure what you're going to get. But Marvel seems to be getting it right recently. I enjoyed this film as a whole, though I thought it had some flaws. Ben Affleck played Daredevil pretty well, but I don't think he was the perfect choice for the role. He doesn't seem quite dark enough to do the character his proper justice. There was even one scene where he flashed typical ""Ben"" smirk that made me cringe. I also felt the movie ran too short and lacked a bit in the character/story development. I enjoyed the supporting cast, especially Jennifer Garner as Elektra Natchios. She had a great screen presence and seemed like a natural in the role. Colin Farrell was an excellent Bullseye. I really enjoyed Jon Favreau as ""Foggy"" Nelson, but his role was one that could have been stronger with a little more screen time. There are some fun bit parts by those who've worked on the Daredevil comic...Kevin Smith, Stan Lee, Frank Miller. I think the film is very well made visually and is dark in tone which is appropriate to the Daredevil story. I had hoped for a little better, but was pleased overall with the movie. *** (out of 4)",Daredevil
169,CountVladDracula,Worst superhero movie in years,1,6 December 2011,"There are so many things wrong with this movie. I don't even know where to begin. Call me a purist for the comic books but I am tired of characters who were not dark being turned into anti-heroes because of a trend. I miss heroes who actually are heroes.For me a man who hunts down and tortured criminals by crippling them and then taunting them before a train hints them, just because the person was lucky enough to win against them in a court of law, is no hero at all. Also wouldn't someone have noticed by now that anyone who wins against him in court seems to die about a night later? I miss when Mat Murdock defended the innocent, not stalked and killed like a sadist like The Punisher.Another issue I have is with Electra. We're talking about a woman who started to beat up a blind man in a playground in front of children just because he followed her and was apparently crushing on her. That's not even remotely sane. What if he had just been some random blind man? I laothe Collin Ferrell's acting, he was part of what destroyed Fright Night's remake (besides a terrible script). This Daredevil movie was just horrible, pointlessly dark and twisted. I wish one day that they would do a Daredevile movie that followed the comic books. Maybe some day people will want heroes who actually have a sense of right and wrong again...",Daredevil
170,Animus,The Dare-devil's in the details...,3,14 February 2003,"Although I am a longtime reader of comic books I have never been interested in the Daredevil character, mainly because the character never seemed real enough to me. The Daredevil of our movie does seem real to me. From the well done sonar-vision to the sleep deprivation tank to his need for massive amounts of pain-killers to deal with his wounds from various fights Ben Affleck's version of Matt Murdock comes alive where the comicbook version lay flat. I liked the story up until the last 10 minutes where it falls apart badly. I have problems with his reaction to the Kingpin vs. his reaction to Bullseye, highly inconsistent and nearly ruins the film. Other than that detail I loved the film, and hope the DVD comes with an alternate ending.",Daredevil
171,CherryBlossomBoy,Horrendous special effects didn't ruin this one,8,19 October 2009,"First let me say that not all of the effects were ""horrendous"", some are in fact pretty impressive, but... a big but... the CGI of the protagonist climbing up the building stands up there, next to ""kite surfing Bond"" from ""Die Another Day"". Worse than cartoon, actually... It briefly ruined suspense of disbelief for this viewer. It took a minute or two to recuperate.Blind attorney during the day, costumed blind vigilante at night, ""Daredevil"" was one of the first comic-book adaptations that rode on the success of Spiderman. The genre was not to be fully fledged for another couple of years (until ""Sin City""). To me it was not as much a revelation as was Tim Burton's ""Batman"" a long while back, but a refreshing step in the right direction, for I'm a sucker for dark ""superheroes"". The concept of a hero fueled by rage and revenge instead of a sense of justice is generally much more convincing and makes a hero more likable and a lot easier to identify with.The film itself translates that concept well, despite some formulaic elements typical for a blockbuster. Gratefully, there are enough offbeat events and characters in ""Daredevil"" to mask the clichés. Along with the atypical hero there are two hilarious villains to behold. Dark tones of cinematography atone for the mood nicely and it's truly a pity that effects department didn't have time to polish their part.All in all, far from a masterpiece, but an enjoyable adaptation.",Daredevil
172,pri_e,room for a sequel,7,17 July 2003,"I really like Marvel comics and after ""Spiderman"", I was interested to hear that they were making a movie version of ""Daredevil"". I wasn't too sure about Ben Affleck being Matt Murdoch, however I was pleased with his performance, however I thought they could have shown more of life as Matt rather than just as Daredevil. The same goes with Elektra Natchios, Jennifer Garner does a great job, however we don't really get to know her character well enough but I guess we will when her movie comes out in 2005. I thought they went a bit fast with the pairing of Matt & Elektra, however it's a story that I think will be captivating if they decide to make another Daredevil movie and build on it. Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell do a good job as Kingpin and Bullseye.I think this movie is just a starting point to what could become even more interesting movie if a sequel is to be made.",Daredevil
173,moviesfan11,"'Daredevil' is flawed, fast, dark and fun",9,2 June 2007,"Daredevil; An accident as a child leaves the inspired, young Matt Murdock completely blind in both eyes. Fast foreward about 30 years and you get Ben Affleck as a smart, brooding lawyer living in New York by day. However, the night brings out a different part of Murdock, as he fights crime in a red suit, and calls himself Daredevil.Murdock's life gets a little more complicated as Elektra enters his life. An encounter at the coffee shop blossoms into love. However, when Kingpin hires the menacing Bullseye to kill Elektra's father, Elektra pins the crime on Daredevil, and seeks vengeance.Daredevil is based on the popular Marvel comics.Anybody who read these comics probably won't care about the films flaws, because even my mind occasionally slipped off them and onto the slick, energetic action sequences. The main problem with 'Daredevil' lies in the camera, which darts around far too much, making far too many of the shots spastic and incoherent. This flaw makes the action sequences less memorable and exciting then they should be. However, 'Daredevil' delivers on a popcorn blockbuster scale, which is exactly what it aims for.Affleck portrays Daredevil decently, however lacks some of the needed sexual charisma without the mask. Garner seems to be having a lot of fun as Elektra, flipping off walls and slashing her sei's. Colin Farrel also seems to be having fun with the role of Bullseye.'Daredevil' has some problems with pacing and direction. However, it has a dark atmosphere, fast and fun action sequences and a wonderful sense of humor about itself. Highly entertaining. 3 from 4.",Daredevil
174,Billy_Crash,Almost Decent...,5,9 February 2004,"As comics to the big screen go, Daredevil was almost decent. The characters of Bullseye and Kingpin were nailed, as well as the essence of Elektra - and except for Affleck's pathetically throaty voice distortion as Daredevil, he wasn't too bad either. Sadly, the movie bulldozed its way through nearly the entire series in a couple of hours.But the worst thing of all was the third rate CGI effects that made the film laughable and prevented it from getting a higher rating above decent. And check out the church scene where bad CGI and bad perspective unite in something completely laughable.If you want to watch outstanding films based on comic books/graphic novels, check out: Ghost World, Road to Perdition and Tank Girl.",Daredevil

There are few times when a ""directors cut"" actually amounts to much. But with this film there truly is so much improvement. With added characters and subplots that are completely nonexistant in the original PG-13 version.I think now with everyone giving Justice League a second chance with the Snyder Cut more people should revisit this film with an open mind as well!",Daredevil

The storyline is pointless, and to be quite honest, really poor acting. 3 stars is being generous. Good to see Michael Clarke Duncan in the film, but I think he should of appeared in a better movie than this.",Daredevil
177,miken-3,Better than what most people are saying,7,20 January 2005,"This well-cast movie packs a lot of story into one film. I remember growing up that Daredevil was always different than other comics after all what other hero was sightless? Also, the artwork of Gene Colon was much more like the artwork of the Dark Knight versions of Batman that come out in the mid-80's. The movie had the same feel. It was a heck of a lot better than the Val Kilmer/George Clooney Batman films but nowhere near the Spiderman movie.As in the comic, Matt Murdock grew up in Hell's Kitchen in lower Manhattan. His father was a fighter that went against a mob boss and decided not to throw a fight. He winds up murdered as a result. Matt is involved in a street accident where some radioactive waste gets in his eyes, removing his sight highly enhancing his other senses.Matt graduates law school and becomes a Legal-aid lawyer for the people of the neighborhood with his pal Foggy Nelson. The neighborhood crime is being controlled by a powerful mob boss nicknamed, The Kingpin. Matt, using his enhanced abilities trains himself to become a masked vigilante named Daredevil who tries to thwart the Kingpin's activities (the Kingpin was behind Matt's father's murder).With his business seriously wounded, Kingpin employs a hired assassin called Bullseye. Bullseye can make a weapon out of any object by throwing it with pinpoint accuracy at his intended victim.Matt meanwhile meets a Greek heiress named Electra. The two begin dating. During a business squabble the Kingpin has Bullseye kill Electra's father, causing her to become a vigilante herself set on getting revenge.There is one corny scene where Matt and Electra mix it up in a battle in a children's playground. It looked like the director wanted to just throw in a scene from The Matrix.I don't want to give too much more of the film away, but if you had followed the storyline in the comics you probably know how the film will turn out. I know I highly enjoyed this film. Colin Farrell is phenomenal as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner looks hot as Electra. The actor who plays Kingpin has been in a lot of movies lately and he had to gain weight to play a convincing Kingpin, which he does well. The movie will probably not appear to smaller children because of the blood and violence but anyone that liked The Matrix films should really like this one! It is one of the films that is better to own than rent because you can watch it over and over.",Daredevil
178,Gambitt,Middle of the pack Super Hero movie,6,12 March 2003,"***Contains small SPOILERS***As a moderate comic geek, I was generally unimpressed with DD. It had its moments but does little to stand out from typical action movies.The acting was so-so.  The worst performance was by Scott Terra, who played young Daredevil.  Normally I cut child actors some slack, but Terra is old-enough that he should be able to achieve some level of competent acting. Plenty of younger actors did better jobs in other movies. Unfortunately, I found Terra so unconvincing that it pretty much ruined the entire ""origin"" story, which as all comic-book buffs know, is a CRUCIAL element of the superhero's characterization.So moving on from that rather weak start, DD's drive and passion for justice felt superficial and cliched throughout the rest of the movie.  The rather average, occasionally cheesey script doesn't help.  I counted only one, rather vague reference to why he is known as ""the man without fear.""Most of DD's action scenes and fight sequences had a been-there-done-that feel.  In fact, DD incorporates many of the worst action trends.  Most of the camera shots are WAY too close so that the viewer can't tell what the heck is going on.  There are repeated, shameless Matrix stunts.  IMO, that's a true sign of modern, action-movie amateurity.  And enough with the slow-motion bicycle kicks already!Another big problem with DD is that even if we buy into the movie's own premise and suppositions, it still fails any credibility test.  Murdock has an almost supernatural extrasensory ability that allows him to react very quickly and fight very well.  Sure, okay, whatever; all superheroes have some special ability.  And actually I DID like how they portrayed DD's perception.However, using plain common sense now, a human being with super-senses STILL can NOT: horizontally leap 50 feet from rooftop to rooftop with not even a running start; vertically run up walls or bounce off them.  This movie reeks of Spiderman.Affleck does an alright job.  The supporting cast was likewise just okay. Like DD, Elektra felt empty and lacked depth (shouldn't she have been a bit suspicious that a blind man trailed her from the coffee shop?).  Michael Clarke Duncan was well cast, but again he should have been built up more. The audience never got a sense of his criminal empire (you know, the one that runs the ENTIRE criminal structure in NYC), and it was silly having him wear that ghetto, dirty undershirt in the final fight.You know a super-hero movie is in trouble when the only interesting character is a villain.  I'm talking about Bullseye played by Farrell. Sure, in many ways his character was the easiest to play because frankly he was supposed to be a shallow character.  But unlike the rest of the cast, Farrell's deadly talents are unique and shown off really well.  He's played up so well that his demise is actually a bit of a let down.All in all, I'd say Daredevil (6/10) was inferior to X-men, Spiderman, Blade I, and the former Batmans, it's still much better than than the stinker Batmans.",Daredevil
179,mwendel,The Comic did not get the respect it deserved. (Possible Spoilers),5,14 February 2003,"Ben Affleck may physically fit the mold of Matt Murdoch/DareDevil but only when he keeps his mouth closed. They needed someone capable of being dark, foreboding and brooding. Jennifer Garner as Elektra wasn't bad, but I still think the Red Satin from the comic would have been the way to go versus the black leather. The black leather just made Elektra too mundane. Michael Clarke Duncan actually made a decent Kingpin, even though you might have been expecting someone more along the lines of King Kong Bundy. Colin Farrell as Bullseye was great. He was totally insane and the character was something, to me, that was totally the opposite of the roles he usually has.I felt the fights scenes, although well done, were too short (except for the one at the bar in the beginning) for a movie of such length.
It is my opinion that the movie left a lot to be desired, especially for comic book fans, for a Marvel Entertainment production that did such a awesome jobs with the X-Men and Spider-Man. The movie was just blah, and not worth the full price of admission. If you're going to go see this movie, make it the matinee.",Daredevil
180,daveisit,Such Sweet Sorrow,1,16 May 2005,"Daredevil achieved nothing as a movie. There was no enjoyment from watching, no interest in the acting, and certainly no belief in the story, whether it be comic super hero or not. For every new scene, and every second I watched, I simply hoped there would be a big turn around and something would spark some interest. This never eventuated and I found myself slipping deeper and deeper into a state of painful shock.As for Ben Affleck, he was simply terrible. Nothing about his performance enhanced his profile as an employable actor. He ripped the shine out of his and all the other performances and spat on the leftovers.",Daredevil
181,giancarlorocks,There isn't a lazier way to leave a sequel open...,8,17 February 2003,"The most exasperating aspect of Ben Affleck's newest catastrophe is howineffective Daredevil' is as a so-called Blockbuster. Set in current day New York, the film traces the origins of an enigmatic superhero similar to thebeginnings of the greatest superhero of all  Batman. As in the former film, the press also languishes Daredevil's existence and brings forth artists' renderings of a half vampire, half man prowling the streets at night. Perhaps if thesuperhero actually was a half man -half vampire, the film would have beenmuch more stirring      Directed by Mark Steven Johnson, Fox had apparently hired him for his die- hard vision of the film, yet, I see absolutely no vision in this film. A film can work only if a story is present, in Daredevil' there is the reoccurring theme ofretribution, yet absolutely no story which is serving as a trajectory for the actions on screen.  It seems like Johnson elected to play it safe and as a result, there is no dichotomy within the character of Matt Murdock-unsighted Lawyer by day,buffed crime fighter by night.      Furthermore, it does not help when he is played by Ben Affleck. Not taking anything away from Ben Affleck, but there is absolutely no delivery in hisperformance. It seems as if Ben was just along for the ride knowing his career will not be stunned if the movie fails. Yet, in five years time, we all know Ben will be looking back and saying, What was I thinking?'.      Seeing as Tim Burton is the pioneer of the dark and gothic film, there is such a thing as too dark and gothic. Daredevil' suffers from this infectious flaw as we see the hero only in dark alleys and choreographed sequences with barely anylight on screen. Taking into account the mastery of such films as Batman' and The Crow', that image worked for those creations, yet in this film, when weactually see Daredevil in a lighted room, we cannot help but laugh at thestupidity of this character. He is simply not believable, many times I found myself as well as others rooting for the villain in order to end Daredevil's miserable display of self-righteousness.      His origins are retold in a formulaic fashion, and his appeal for justice comes out of the loss for someone  as it always is. Yet, Director Mark Steven Johnson suffers from the curse Batman Returns' suffered from  an inundation ofcharacters. Colin Farrell is maliciously cast as the venerable villain Bullseye'. He is probably the best part of the film. Despite his limited dialogue, herelinquishes this role and creates a veritable good time as his homicidal angst works well. Then there is another villain played by Michael Clarke Duncan,many have lamented that his Kingpin' comic book character is of a white male Caucasian, but Duncan plays it well as best as he can as a huge Black Manwith arms of steel as will be seen in the studio-set filmed fabricated climax.     Wait -  enemies do not stop there. Within the city of New York, there is another unbalanced mind by the name of Elektra Natchios who after seeing her fathermurdered by Daredevil, decides to also put on a suit and wreak havoc all inhopes of defeating Daredevil.       Now, I was expecting a good time at the movies, but this film can be equated with pure mindless dribble. I did enjoy the dark tone of the film and the nihilistic beliefs of the murderous Daredevil character, but the rest of the film was wasted celluloid. The only great part is at the very end within the showdown ofDaredevil and Kingpin. If someone can think of a lazier way of keeping a sequel open  please let me know.      Furthermore, this film has the most ineffective use of camera angles. Usually the Dutch Tilt' is supposed to evoke some kind of anticipation within a scene, yet, Johnson implements the angles during a standard courtroom sequence.There are some great shots, but none of them innovative. Furthermore, asaforementioned it is too dark of a film and the overabundance of darknessprobably is used as a cosmetic to mask the most horrible screenplay for a comic book character besides the Dolph Lundgren fiasco The Punisher'. Johnsonalso wrote the film and I admire him for trying to cram in as much as he could for the movie buck. But that is where the problem is  he crammed in too much.Furthermore, there were so many fade-outs to end scenes in the film it gave me a headache. It seemed as if the rushed postproduction schedule rushed theediting of the film, which is also tepid at best.      In conclusion, when it comes to film I am both selective and cynical. I am very harsh when it comes to film because they cost a lot to see and many times wewaste our time on them and cannot get that valuable time back  this is a solid example. The magic of cinema is slowly escaping us as studios are bringingforth plenty of bad cinema all in the name of a dollar. While it will have a strong opening weekend, it will succumb to a horrible second weekend, as the wordwill be out on the horridness of this film. By the way, if you really like the Bullseye character, stick around during the end credits, there is a littlesurpriseGiancarlo's Rating: *",Daredevil
182,theemuhammede,The blind justice,8,14 May 2016,"This movie was not the ordinary super hero. Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is an attorney who will only defend those who are innocent. He is also blind after a hazardous chemical accident happened when he was a young teen. Murdock is an advocate for serving justice and protecting those who need it most. Murdock was an attorney by day, and Daredevil by night.The fighting choreography in this was innovative and unlike any other. It was cool how the fact that Murdock is blind was significantly considered when developing each of the sequences to reflect how he has adapted with his other senses in order to perfect his reflexes.It would have been better if there was more of both Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) in this movie. It would have added to a much stronger and interesting story.",Daredevil
183,eamon-hennedy,Excellent Comic Book Film.,8,3 November 2003,"Having never read the adventures of Daredevil in comic book format, I was, however, familiar with the interesting story so I awaited the film with interest. Ben Affleck may have looked the part, but I was worried that he would too bland to carry it off, but alas I have to say the film it a success. Sure it ain't art, it's not striving to be. The film is after all starring a fan of the comics and has been written and directed by a fan. Mark Stephen Johnson was an unusual choice, having directed Simon Birch, but like Peter Jackson starting of doing zombie films and then moving on to Lord of The Rings, having a fan at the helm is a help to the film. Johnson treats the film with respect, he's not afraid to go into darker routes, like Tim Burton with Batman and creates a film that is very entertaining. The darker elements work brilliantly here. If Spiderman is Marvel's Superman then Daredevil is undoubtedly the Batman of the Marvel universe. Although he has enhanced senses, Matt Murdock is at the end of the day human. He scars easily and has to take pain killers and is at heart only in this gig for revenge, although the fighting for justice element is there in a more fuller way than in Batman. Murdock is a lawyer for his day job.Affleck is surprisingly effective here as Murdock/Daredevil. Scenes of him doing his usual routine (folding his money up so as to know which bill is which) and trying to see Elekra in the rain work fantastically and Affleck is, I have to say, superb at times. His performance as a blind man is spot on and while the character is a darker hybrid over Spiderman, the emotional elements are here too and they work fantastically. Having been in love with Jennifer Garner since Alias I am biased over her performance here. She is superb as Elektra, and even better is that unlike Mary Jane she ain't no mere love interest, this is a tough girl and despite the film's ending, I think it's safe to say a spin-off movie is on the cards. On an extra note that ending is shocking, not to mention brutal. Then there's the baddies. Michael Clarke Duncun is good as always as Kingpin, but Colin Farrell is the revelation here. Like The Joker in the first Batman film, Farrell is over the top and fun to watch and never outstays his welcome. His electric delivery and his sticking to his Irish accent works wonders and the character can be both fun, yet unflinchingly brutal (once again I point to the ending).Hopefully this is a franchise in the making. While I did love Spiderman and I can't wait for its sequel, it  would be nicer to see the darker cousin in his own series.",Daredevil

But at night Matt becomes Daredevil, a man with no fear, he may be blind but he has incredible senses, that helps him know when the bad guys come. During this time Matt meets Electra(Jennifer Garner) has their relation grow, Kingpin hires Bullseye(Collin Farrell) a deadly hit man, a man almost never misses his target. To put out a hit on Electra, will Daredevil defeat them in time? I love this movie because the fact that Daredevil is a blind superhero. The performances were also enjoyable besides the action.

187,saint405,Who's the devil that took a dare and made this movie?,3,15 July 2005,"Daredevil in my opinion is the worst comic book hero turned movie ever! It's a complete mess of characters and the story is boring, no interest in any way to enjoy. The story is the same as the comics about some kid who is blinded by some poisonous waste but now his stronger sense's have turned him into a dare taker, a.k.a the Daredevil. Soon his father is murdered after he wins a boxing fight. The young Daredevil finds this out and starts hanging out with a stranger who teaches him new fighting techniques, thus creating the Daredevil. Years later he finds out the person who killed his father wants him dead as well. Now the acting is really bad, utter embarrassment. The characters in fact are really bad, like the Kingpin! Wasn't he a Spider-Man villain? Plus we have Bullseye, a horrid henchman with a killer aim. The love interest is blah, gross and Matt's friend who tries to be funny is not needed. The story is mediocre with more twists in it than a not and the special affects are cheesy. This film is the lowest of all comic films. Yes worst than the Hulk, nowhere near as good as X-Men or X-Men 2, and it gets crushed by the Spider-Man films! All I have to say is why did they make a movie like this? Daredevil gets a 3 for being boring, bland, and stupid. Not recommended because this film is a big let down.",Daredevil
188,Pingo-2,Too much computer animations.,5,29 July 2003,"DareDevil is not a bad film, though it's not a good one either.After a while, this movie tends to drag on too long. But the main thing why it feels a bit boring is all the CGI (3D-animations). There are simply too much of them. Like in Matrix: Reloaded and in well, almost ALL movies of today, the effects are based on computer animations, which, to put it simple: looks boring and usually, very bad.In DareDevil, with a budget of $75,000,000 one should expect more, and better, effects. To see a jumping guy in a red suit that doesn't look convincing is not entertainment. It just gets boring.But instead of hireing stunt-men that do wire-stunts that look real, or just not doing these kinds of shots, they spend millions on stuff you've seen in plenty of films before and we didn't like it then either.In Jurassic Park (1993) the dinosaurs looked real. Now, ten years later, they still can't make a guy jump and make it look good. Wow, how impressed I am that they spent $75 MILLIONS on this!The script (by director Mark Steven Johnson) is not that good either. There are plenty of plot-holes and it doesn't hold any suspension. Why? Because we know everything from frame one. DareDevil is a cool comic character. The movie does not make this cool guy justice.Spider-Man and X-Men was good. HULK and DareDevil wasn't. Lets hope that the rest of the Marvel-movies are better than this. But they can only do it better if they stop this 3D-frenzy that is SOOOOOOOO over used.5 out of 10",Daredevil

190,lopcar1993,an okay comic book adaption,6,31 March 2009,"This comic book adaption directed by Mark Steven Johnson & staring Ben Affleck( Who I thought was good, but not good enough.) stars as the title character, this adaption is very close to it's comic book roots and it plays very well to the audience( those who haven't read the comics.) and comic book fans alike. It's a very well made and mildly well acted film and in my book, and I hope others agree, is a very good comic book adaption and will appeal to any comic book fans and others who haven't read or seen the movie before. There was one thing that I found they did wrong in this film, casting Colin Farrell as Bullseye. Don't get me wrong Collin Farrell is a good actor but he was just completely wrong for the part, he didn't have the right style or the coolness that the comic book bullseye did, Michael Clark Duncan in my opinion was a good cast ad the Kingpin, he's massive enough to play the role and he's got he right attitude and style to pull it off too. But all in all this comic book adaption of one of Marvel's greatest and most popular hero's is a hit with me, and I hope it is with you too.",Daredevil
191,Streetwolf,started off good....,6,3 March 2003,"I really wasn't in the mood to watch another superhero movie, but I decided to give this a chance.****Minor Spoilers****Summary: Matt Murdock was blinded by radioactive waste when he was 12 after learning that his father was still working for the Kingpin, a wild shot in the dark, that's the villain. Matt realized that even though he was unable to see his other senses were now extremely stronger than before and he was able to put his new founded powers to use making him almost fearless. After somewhat hearing and feeling his father die in front of him he grew up training himself and becoming the Daredevil, a fearless superhero, who helped the helpless bla bla bla... but a journalist makes Daredevil seem as if he is the bad guy, which didn't sit too well with Matt. Enter the woman, Elektra, daughter of some rich guy, who had connections to the Kingpin. Elektra and Matt fall in love, but at the same time an assassin is sent to kill her father and the Daredevil happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time making Elektra think that Daredevil caused her father's death........Well the movie had potential, the stunts were over the top but nice, the movie was dark yet worth watching until Elektra turns on Daredevil, that's when the movie starts going downhill, everything starts happening faster, the lines are shorter and dull, the plot gets more predictable and right to the end the actors seem bored and ready to call it a day as quickly as possible. Ben Affleck looked great as did Jennifer Garner in her fight scenes.I rated this movie a 6/10, I liked the scenes with Elektra and Matt when they met, but the ending just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.",Daredevil
192,jake-179,"Terrible, really bad fight choreography",1,23 February 2003,"This movie was severly flawed.  I have noticed some very estute IMDB commentators who have remarked on the flaws of the script, and terrible acting, and how it seemed this movie was slopped together.  So rather than be redundant, I want to get right to the point of the movie that bothered me the most:  the fight choreography.***SPOILERS***Having Ben Afleck and Jen Garner performing Kung Fu style fight scenes was a HUGE mistake.  It seems to me that the makers of this movie were trying to jump on THE MATRIX band wagon.  They believe that with some slick editing, they do not have to have leads who are proficient in Martial Arts to pull off complex choreography.  This was the nail in the coffin for this movie. It was very distracting to see these two actors lumbering through their moves.  In particular, the fight scene in the park when Ben is trying to get Jen's name.  Jen throws some really sloppy kicks at the beginning and she is so slow its just comical.  Everybody keeps commenting on how Jen's experience on ""ALIAS"" has prepared her for a role like this...nothing could be further from the truth.  She looked so pathetic up there, good looks aside.  And Ben Afleck was INCREDIBLY AWKWARD!  At one point, he dodges some sloppy move from Jen, and stands to the side with his arms out, and it looks so TERRIBLE!  He really looks like he is staggering around trying to keep up with what is going on.  This was really, really bad!In ""THE MATRIX,"" the cast worked with Yuen Woo Ping and his crew for over 4 months, perfecting only three major fight scenes:  The Kung Fu School, The Bathroom, and The Subway.  And even at that, they still looked a little stiff, but they pulled it off somewhat believably.  Except, of course, for the part where Neo does a back flip out of the path of the oncoming subway train, and he is clearly hanging on to the wires.  But in Daredevil, it was obvious the actors did not put in enough effort to learn the moves.  It looked like they didn't practice the fight scenes until the day of shooting.A lot of people have written reviews on the IMDB complimenting the fight scenes, which goes to show these people don't really have an appreciation of what a good fight scene is.  For these people, I suggest they start out watching THE MATRIX, and then move on to the real classics, such as DRUNKEN MASTER 1 and 2, OPERATION CONDOR, FIRST STRIKE, SNAKE IN EAGLE'S SHADOW, BLADE, or even more recently SHANGHAI NIGHTS.Some other complaints on the movie are: why does Matt Murdock possess the ability to jump from building to building with MATRIX-like ability?  He gets squirted in the face with a chemical and that gives him super human jumping ability?  The physics behind Bullseye's throwing ability were rediculous. The fight in the church...how high up is the ceiling of that stupid church? 500 feet?  And the end when Daredevil defeats Kingpin...he kicked him in the back of the knees?  Is there some special weakness Kingpin has behind his knees that I am not aware of?Bullseye was way over the top. The first guy he kills by throwing a paper clip...yes, you read that right, a paper clip.  The next person he kills is an old lady...yes, you read that right, an old lady.  He kills her with a peanut!  Yes, you read that right, a PEANUT!  The third person he kills is a guard...he kills him by throwing pencils in to his neck...yes, you read that right, pencils.  And then he kills NACHOS by throwing Daredevil's  cane from about 100 yard away.  The cane was not even sharp, but it impaled him anyway!  This was just silly.One other particularly bothersom scene was when ""Electra"" was practicing with her swords with those sand bags.  First of all, what a messy way to practice!  I would not want to have to clean up all that sand.  Second of all, once again Jen Garner shows how inept she is with Martial Arts,  She needs to seek out some SERIOUS Martial Arts training if she is going to continue making these movies.  She looked just ridiculous clauding around up there.Finally, a note to Ben Afleck and Jen Garner:  Two days of Kung Fu lessons is NOT enough.  Kung Fu takes PRACTICE and dedication.  It takes a lot to be an action star, and those two just don't have it.",Daredevil

194,qball_82,Not as bad as they say...!,7,20 March 2003,"This film seems to be getting a lot of mixed reviews, with most leaning towards the negative kind.  I had to see for myself, and I had prepared myself for the worst.  The verdict?  Not as bad as they say!Definitely not in the same league as Spiderman (you know the comparisons are BOUND to happen!), but Daredevil has merits of its own.  Somewhat darker, it had a more realistic feel.  It was kinda odd, but it didn't really feel like a ""superhero"" film.  Daredevil has to be the most imperfect superhero I've seen on the big screen - which was interesting to watch.  The pace was a little slow at times, but not yawn-inducingly so.The actors did a good job.  Contrary to what others have written, I felt Affleck fit the role nicely, he does well conveying the 'darkness' in Daredevil's character.  Garner was pretty cool also, and although it would have been nice to see something more of a back story for her character, Elektra was a fun character to watch.  Conclusion?  Don't believe the (negative) hype!  See it for yourself.  I for one was pleasantly surprised.  Bring on the sequel.",Daredevil

Also standard for this genre are unconvincing male leads with the notable exceptions of Christopher Reeves as Superman and Wesley Snipes in ""Blade"".  Ben Affleck fails here.  I have no sympathy for his character.

I am still trying to figure out how the ""accident"" generated all the abilities the Daredevil had, where his training came from, and why an injury could leave him too injured to stand but allow him to vault around like a giant cricket a few minutes later. It makes the origins of Spiderman and Superman look like scientifically sound and the death's door to victory climax would make a pro wrestler proud. And why didn't they let Affleck wear padding under his street clothes? His shoulders became so much wider when he put the hero suit on I had to laugh every time he did the clothing switch. For all this I am still recommending it as a better than average cartoon.",Daredevil

It was just a good movie and I had a fun time watching it. There was only one major problem I had with it. Aside from Collin Farrell who had some fun as Bullseye, the performances were pretty bad. Ben Affleck gave one of the dullest performances of the year. Wesley Snipes in Blade was like Sir Lawrence Olivier compared to Ben Affleck in Daredevil.The cinematography by Ericson Core was excellent. Everything was beautifully lit.

199,SILENCEikillyou,High expectations...,8,30 July 2003,"I'm going to turn over my spot here to reference an opinion that so well mirrored my own that i ""dare"" not touch it.  Noel Bailey from this comments column said it best (I'm paraphrasing; contradicting myself again):  What were people looking for in this title?  Please read his comments; I think we could all learn a lesson from those words.  AND remember (not to categorize too much) Aussies usually don't think THAT highly (from what I've found) of American flicks.  Not all Australians and not all films OBVIOUSLY!  Just something to remember.I like this film and was fully entertained.  Love, action, drama, effects, plot and good vs. evil.  All from a comic book title, too.  And i'm not an Alias fan, nor an Affleck fan.  But they were great together, like in music, or the sounds of raindrops.  Watch out J. Lo.Seriously, both leads just fit together.  Jennifer Garner was absolutely stunning (and even before she was decked in her skin tight leather or vinyl suit).  Ben Affleck didn't ""try"" too hard in this one to shine and therefore, i think he did just that.  I really believed in his blindness, as well as his powers.  Hard to pull off, if you think about it.  He was only allowed on cocky moment in the beginning and i'm glad for that.

200,arnieiam,"Some Strenghts, Lots of Weaknesses",7,26 May 2012,"Well I felt like giving this a review even though it's almost 10 years later. With the lineup of Marvel comics films now done, I think its time to put this one in retrospect.First of all, yes, the director's cut is way better than the theatrical release since it fills in a lot more plot holes and really develops the characters with its longer running time.Still you would think that a movie with this kind of intriguing premise would have been executed better. A lawyer by day, an acrobatic vigilante by night and he's blind! That is what Marvel is great at, making these kind of characters. And I'm glad that the film chose to go with the developments made by Frank Miller and the minor ones by Kevin Smith, making this film more darker in tone than Spider-Man which came out the previous year before that.Well off the bat I could say I wasn't too thrilled about the acting done by the kid who played the young Murdock. Neither the playground fight scene with Elektra and Murdock. It got incredibly cheesy with the narration by Affleck. We don't get to see much of his lawyering even with the gigantic subplot in the director's cut. None of that I plead the fifth or citing a previous case or something like. The blatant character exposition ('I want revenge' or 'justice'). And it's never a good idea to use Dutch angles (Battlefield Earth... ring any bells?). Just overall the dialogue became very cheesy and unnatural.Well it still manages to take advantages of its premise. They really show us Murdock's catholicness which Kevin Smith developed on. They actually made a costume which looks like it's wearable... enough. They had two pretty cool villains. Colin Farrell really nailed it as Bullseye and thank god they made him into an Irish biker. Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk who actually looked like the guy in the comic well except... he's darker. The scene where Daredevil is dodging Bullseye's projectiles by backflipping was crazy. And I can say that Jennifer Garner is hot, that is all.And let me say the soundtrack kicks all kinds of ass. This has to be the best soundtrack to any superhero film ever. It was during the dying stages of nu metal which I dearly miss to this day.",Daredevil
201,johnplocar,This is more of a talk about the Director's Cut...,8,15 March 2016,"The theatrical cut has been talked about to death so I think I'd rather speak of its extended cut instead. The Director's Cut of the 2003 Ben Affleck ""DareDevil"" film has received quite the praise over the original version released in theaters. I will admit that it is an improvement on the first cut, I don't know if it is actually deserving of the amount of praise it has obtained over the years. To start off though I'll give a brief synopsis. For anyone who isn't familiar with the film or the title character; a lawyer, who had lost his sight as a kid, grows tired of the excessive crime that has taken over New York City so he takes a stand as the red suited vigilante known as DareDevil. Even though he is technically blind he gained a new way to ""see"" with using sound and smell to get an understanding of his surroundings. In his fight against crime, the Kingpin/Wilson Fisk takes notice of his doings and subsequently decides to put a stop to his crusade against his criminal organization; calling in an assassin named Bullseye to take him out along with his love interest, Electra Natchios, and her father. For the most part I do like this movie and what it tried to do with the superhero genre. It wanted to be dark and gritty, showing some of the depressing turmoil that the hero is going through. A guy trying to do everything he can to save his city and the people that inhabit it while also now yearning to have a life of his own. I can definitely appreciate that, granted those things have been done before in other previous comic book films such as Tim Burton's ""Batman"". But this did have a slight edge to it, with the director's cut anyhow. There is this one scene where Murdock is getting back home after having run into a bit of a beating himself; bruised and bloodied he's stumbling to make his way to rest when right at the last moment before he lays down, because of his abilities, he hears a woman being murdered. That just adds a whole new layer to the character that was left missing in the theatrical cut. This poor guy that has just pushed his physical limits in hopes to bring justice to the innocent and make a difference, exhausting himself so much that now all he can do is listen to a woman screaming for help which is then followed by her last breaths. That helps so much for me to actually sympathize with the inner torment that this character has as apposed to the theatrical cut that came across as more of him brooding for the sake of brooding. With the director's cut it does constantly show that the hero life isn't all that glamorous and he doesn't get the girl; while the theatrical cut showed that he balances his romantic interests and being a crime fighter just fine, but he still broods unreasonably so. The problems that I have with both versions is that it tries so hard to set itself grounded in reality, but the laws of physics almost never apply. The love story, while better in the director's cut, isn't all that strong. The main story isn't anything all that special and feels especially disjointed in the director's cut towards the end trying two handle more than one plot line. And lastly, the musical score...it is very good and it is completely wasted because they shoved it over to have a popular modern day rock soundtrack. Which I wouldn't have minded if the score wasn't so good, but it is and deserves a lot better treatment than what it got. The good? Honestly, I know most would disagree, but I like Ben Affleck as DareDevil. I think he does well in selling this rundown vigilante, I buy that he's blind, he handles the action pretty well, he has charisma to him and I think that he does a decent job in the courtroom scenes. I'm sure that most look at this as a reason why not to have him as the next Batman, but I find it to be part of his defense. Any problems with ""DareDevil"" are far from being Affleck's fault, everything he offered to the film I believe paid off. It's the writers and producers as well as the director are the reasons why this came out the way it did. Even though I like it, I know it's flawed but it's not by any means terrible. In my opinion it's passable enough. Plus, just watching Michael Clarke Duncan having the time of his life being larger than life as Wilson Fisk/Kingpin is a lot of fun. He gives this two dimensional, cartoon villain a total watchable factor and is one of the highlights alongside Colin Farrell's ridiculously eccentric role as Bullseye. So yeah, I think the film has plenty in its favor that doesn't give this such the awful reputation that it received, but I also don't think the director's cut is quite the perfect gem either. I think that overall it's alright, but could be better and a hell of a lot worse too. Take it for what it's worth.",Daredevil
202,Sparrow_in_flight,better than I expected,10,22 June 2003,"To be honest, I just went to this because the special effects and stunts looked interesting. I had no interest in the comic character, and I'm not a huge Affleck fan. But he did a good job 9not as good as Tobey Maguire in Spiderman) and pulled it off. The others did well too. so, instead of a crappy movie with good effects and stunts, I got a good movie with good effects and stunts, that I will soon be buying.",Daredevil
203,chuckrules,It was nothing special,5,13 May 2003,"Marvel's latest adaptation is significantly better that the ones from the 80s but a notch below the recent efforts.  This is one dark movie and that is definitely in tone with some of the storylines as established in the series.  The amount of violence and the actual results of the violence is significantly greater than in previous comic movies.Ben Affleck handles his lead role fairly well.  He portrays the hero who has some enhanced abilities but is bottom line just human and his body feels the pain more than everyone knows.  The scene with the medicine cabinet was priceless for it's feel of truth.  Michael Clark Duncan is perfect as The Kingpin, his arch-nemesis.  I realize that is not accurate casting as compared with the comic but I honestly can't think of anyone else to portray him.  Colin Farrell was great as Bullseye.  He also wasn't completely accurate but he seemed to be having a great time with the role.  Jennifer Garner is probably the weakest link.  She portrays the character much as the one that obviously won her the role (Alias on television) but it is a poorly written character and has even less to do with the comic than the others.I wasn't overjoyed by this one but I wasn't too depressed either.",Daredevil

He's a superhero, but not by much. Affleck did well in this role, but if you don't like him you probably won't like this movie. He had strength, however. Garner as the female lead was good in the action sequences but did not emote well. Ferrell as Bullseye was almost goofy. Overall the movie engaged me and I was surprised that it did.",Daredevil

Daredevil doesn't suffer the slow moments and has plenty of excellent action, the fight sequences are well choreographed.

Maybe if I find myself lamenting one day on how my own life is so complicated and I start wallowing in my own self-pity, I'll watch this movie again just to remind myself how messed up other people can be!Marvel has a tendency to render misery as a condiment for its super-heroes. Like all of them, Daredevil should wear a sign saying, ""Don't love me, or you'll die!""  Oh well, so goes the life of the gifted and the damned.Makes you like having a normal life, eh?Anyway, I liked the movie and Affleck was great in it.

That said, it will be hard for anyone to see anything. Ironically enough, there isn't much to see. The whole movie is batman meets catwoman and they both go off to meet spiderman. What makes it unique is that it is a weak script that was only made as to take advantage of the semi success of other cartoon books movies. The CGI smells of cheap leather suits, matrix wanna be effects and bad choreography. In other words, nothing to see here folks. The only redeeming points were we cast, for having it not been it, this wouldn't have lasted more than a week in theaters.

It started out good enough, and there were a few worthwhile scenes, but it had its problems: 1. Garner...Still think she's too man-ish, and what was the point of the bad fake green contacts? 2. The cameos are getting to be a bit much- Affleck pal Kevin Smith, Marvel's Stan Lee... plus every minor character had an ""in-joke"" name (Jack Kirby, John Romita - all Marvel Comics artists) 3. Murdock comes off as a bit of a stalker when first meeting Elektra 4. His mortal wound seems to miraculously heal and not bother him as he jumps up and fights two more villains 5.

210,The Spectacular Spider-Man,Marvel comics rule; now Marvel movies do too,6,9 February 2003,"How weird is this? Marvel used to constantly make terrible movies....and now they're making the best superhero movies ever, one after the other. First there was X-Men in 2000, then Spider-Man in 2002, and now Daredevil. DD is like a cross between Spidey and Batman, and it outdoes them both on many levels.For a start, let me tell you the fight scenes are far and away the best ever seen in a superhero movie. The acrobatic choreography far outdoes that of Spider-Man. And they are exciting as well - DD doesn't wipe out hordes of bad guys without getting touched himself. He gets hurt even when he wins.As for the bad guys, the Kingpin and Bullseye have real menace, unlike the Green Goblin and most of Batman's onscreen enemies, and Elektra is the best comicbook femme fetale since Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. Not that she's really a bad guy. Ben Affleck as the titular hero is spot on for the comicbook character, he really is perfect. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, now Affleck as DD - Marvel is filling cinemas with great action heroes.So how does it rank? Purely as a movie, it's not The Fellowship of the Ring (let's start saying that instead of Citizen Kane now, shall we?), but it's fantastic entertainment with genuine emotion and brains behind it. As a comicbook flick, it's below the first Batman and Superman movies (isn't everything?), but it's up there with X-Men, Spider-Man and The Crow.DD kicks ass, basically.

Not bad at all..!!,9,16 September 2018,"Over a decade of listening to reviewers and audiences criticizing Ben Affleck as poor casting, and very bad reviews, I decided to watch to see for myself how bad a movie can be.Surprisingly, this movie has a brilliant cast. From the main characters to even characters ij subplot.
Story, Screenplay were good. Action scenes were great in the beginning of movie but, it became CGI cartoon by the end of movie..That was the only negative in this movie.A perfect comic book movie in all sense.The visualization of Daredevil's 'sonar vision' is something that would've given me goosebumps if I had watched it way back in 2003. 
There are somethings that should be seen,and somethings to be done while you are still a kid. The resulting awe and chills you experience is something beyond explanation, something you won't get when you are an adult.
Thanks to the poor reviews, I missed this movie.Could've been another of my childhood favourite after Spiderman and Batman.The Director's Cut shouldve been released without any change.
Maybe this is when Marvel decided not to put their hands into editing and screenplay.

212,daria84,What a big joke! --spoilers--,1,4 May 2003,"Indeed.  I love comics, I always have, and Daredevil was one of my favorite super heroes, but this was a big joke!  One of the worst movies of the 2003 indeed.  They advertised way too much this movie, and it turned out to be so bad!To start, it doesn't even make sense!  At the beginning Daredevil says ""when you are about to die your whole life flashes in one second"" or something like that, then we get this loooooooooong and boring flashback of his life. It was essential to the story, yes, but it could have been done so much better!  Anyways and in the end he just goes away and is not hurt anymore?? What is that?? Of course they weren't going to kill the hero in this kind of movie, but they could have done a better job with the dialogs and script!
And also the casting was awful!  Ben Affleck should have never, EVER be casted as a super hero!  He is the kind of actor for cheesy chick-flick movies like ""Force of Nature"", ""Pearl Harbor"" and some others, he is NOT a super hero!  He can't perform a superhero in other words, he tries really hard but fails miserably.  He has the looks, and the body to make a superhero, that is true, but his lacks of the most important thing: TALENT. Jennifer Garner was ok, wasn't great either.  Colin Farrell was fairly descent in this one, although the only good performance in s*** movie is from Michael Clark Duncan.However, I don't understand a thing, and don't take me wrong, this is not a racist comment, just a regular comment.  King Pin is supposed to be white! Why did they cast MCD for this movie?? He is a great actor, one of my favorites, but this story is not for him, and this is not his kind of movies.The only thing that saves this movie from total doom is the soundtrack and the songs.  They have really good bands, especially Evanescence. Everything else was BAD!Well I really recommend everybody to AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS and buy the soundtrack instead.",Daredevil

Unlike in other movies where the hero need to face the enemy many times, and a bad person only need a mask to go undetected forever.Of course, like all Marvel movies, the hero acts, jumping around, getting serious injured but still fighting, are totally unrealistic, but I find the acting and effects are done very well and make it really enjoyable to watch.As other Marvel movies, the story is thin, but at least here there is a red line and you recognize the scenes from the comic.",Daredevil
214,shakawtwf,Felt immature and unprofessionally done,5,10 February 2008,"I didn't hate the movie, the idea of a blind superhero was quite intriguing (and the scene where he ""sees"" Jennifer Garner in the rain was quite beautiful) but all of the main characters behaved as if they were schoolchildren acting in a play. Ben and Jen's first real encounter is on the street and her first instinct is to engage him in martial arts? Really? Why? Because she knows martial arts and everyone who knows martial arts gets into a fight every chance they get? (I thought they tried to avoid fights whenever possible. At least that's what Mr. Miyagi taught me.) Michael Clarke Duncan wasn't a bad guy but an actor's idea of a bad guy. He might as well have had a sign around his neck that said ""I'm just playin'"".All scenes were like that. Either they worked really well or they didn't work.",Daredevil

Daredevil seeks revenge against the two criminals despite being the one blamed for their murders.This film starred: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner & Colin Farrell.DAREDEVIL was released in 2003. In my opinion this is an OK film but was not as good as what I was expecting. The standout performance in this film was Colin Farrell as BULLSEYE. I thought he gave a really good performance. Ben Affleck is a great actor in my opinion but it wasn't one of his best performances in this film and I was left disappointed. The fight sequences are decent in this film and one decent performance by an actor leaves you wanting more from DAREDEVIL. I don't really recommend this film because it isn't that good but there is certainly worse films that you could see***/***** Could be worse.",Daredevil

Maybe it's just that I watched the first screening on opening day on the biggest cinema screen in this country in a virtually empty arena, but I enjoyed the flick quite a bit. I wouldn't call it a good movie, very cliched and somewhat generic like most super hero flicks, but fun. The lead heel (Kingpin) was totally underdeveloped, he was a cool character, but we hardly got to see him! Fun movie for one time viewing though.",Daredevil

I like the way character are developed in Marvel's format versus the much shallower action orientation of Dell, etc.This movie was well enough made to fit its audience and had adequate action. But one thing disturbed me; the unrelenting darkness.  There was virtually zero happiness or levity, and if there was, it was efficiently quelled within a minute.  What I am saying is that Batman was a dark character/movie, but this made Batman seem like a Barney show.I like to walk out of movies either laughing, thrilled or fired up.

220,SHB_73,Take the Dare,7,14 February 2003,"Daredevil is one of the better comic book movies to come from Marvelcomics. Ben Affleck stars as the title character who by day is criminalattorney Matt Murdoch, By night he is the costumed vigilante who fightscrime as Daredevil, the man without fear. Daredevil is perhaps one ofthe most unique superheroes for one simple reason: he's blind. A resultof an accident as a boy when biohazardous waste is sprayed into hiseyes. But although he's lost his vision, another result is his other 4senses have been heightened (hearing, smell, touch, taste). As well asstrength and a sort of Radar sense. While the movie is actioned packedit's main problem is character development. I wanted to learn more aboutthe background of the characters but the movie doesn't do it unlike whatSam Raimi did for Spider-Man (2002). But overall The cast is well chosenas Daredevil, Ben Affleck is good, Jennifer Garner as Electra, ColinFarrell was brilliant, but underused as Bullseye, There was controversyover Michael Clarke Duncan's role as the Kingpin since in the comics, heis a middle aged white man. But Duncan was definetley the right choiceto play Wilson Fisk/Kingpin, unfortunately he is underused as well.Overall Daredevil is a pretty good action movie, but not much plot. Istill highly recommend it.",Daredevil
221,c_p_c,No Spiderman,4,17 February 2003,"While not a totally abhorable film, DAREDEVIL fails in many areas.  First, the Daredevil character is not as well known as say the likes of Batman, Superman, or the recent Spiderman.  To make the DAREDEVIL film following the box office smash SPIDERMAN, it would have to live up to the web slinger.  It just doesn't.DAREDEVIL falls prey to the comic book hero rubric, in that there is an accident that gives the hero his/her powers and a family death that provides for motivation in the use of those powers, and that is exactly it, nothing new.The characters, particularly the Daredevil himself are not horrible, but nothing special and certainly not very memorable.  Ben Affleck's performance is mediocre at best and his portrayal of the blind man doesn't seem very realistic, more of just a scripted portrayal.  Jennifer Garner's as Elektra is nothing special either.  What could have been a promising character (no doubt Garner was made for the part) was cut short and just there for kicks (literally).  Micheal Clarke Duncan's talent is gone to waste as well, as his character (the Kingpin) is not given much screen time, nor do we ever learn much about him.  Colin Farrel is the one who truly steals the show. His over the top, yet effective portrayal of the Bullseye is very daunting and quite creepy at times.  Of all the good talent this movie holds within itself, it goes to waste here.Finally, the fight scenes are nothing new and are not that creative.  This is in part due to Daredevil's weapons, or lack thereof.  They become just like swordfights or little duals and do not have the alure of Spiderman's or Batman's fight scenes.Overall, not a very successful attempt to bring a superhero underdog to the bigh screen.  This movie is a typical superhero movie without much creativity, and like I mentioned earlier part of that is just due to the lack of creativity with the Daredevil story.  Not offering anything new, but still managing to withstand itself, I give DAREDEVIL a 4/10.",Daredevil
222,skiop,Excellent superhero movie,8,11 June 2006,"Who would have guessed a movie about a superhero nobody's heard of would turn out to be one of the best superhero movies of the last couple of decades?The hero here is Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck). Matt was rendered blind as a child and to top it off, his father was murdered. As an adult, Matt tries to serve justice by working as a lawyer by day and a vigilante crime fighter at night.Soon, he meets Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), a Greek woman with an equally tragic past. They are both hoping that with their new-found love, they can move on and be happy, but the worst is yet to come.This movie has very good action scenes, but the best parts are the sad, tragic parts involving Matt and Elektra. They both share a common past (that's the point) and it keeps getting worse. The best scenes are the funeral and the cops breaking onto Elektra's roof. These are so sad and the former says so much about what the characters are feeling through the appropriate use of music (no it's not a musical).The villain here is Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), who uses hit-man Bullseye (Colin Farrell). Kingpin is creepy and enigmatic (more so in the theatrical cut), and Bullseye is over-the-top.The performances are pretty good. Affleck is adequate. Duncan and Farrell ooze the campy villain feel, but Farrell unfortunately occasionally crosses the line between fun and grating. But the best thing about the movie may be Garner. She's a fantastic actress and her stunts are just incredible.And speaking of stunts, the FX here are a bit uneven (that's OK, FX are secondary to story). As I said, Garner has several good stunts, the best of which is the wall flip. Affleck isn't so lucky, with a few noticeably fake sequences, on the motorcycle and in the church, in particular. This is all understandable, as this had a limited budget, and not all effects could have been reasonably done without the aid (and hence, artificiality) of a computer.Oddly, we have really attractive people in the cast who are made less attractive than usual. Affleck with the bad hair and cataracts (fabulous abs, shoulders and back, though), Garner with those freaky contacts, and a barely recognizable Farrell, bald and with a huge coat hiding his bod.Regardless of which version you see, you'll be entertained. I'd recommend the theatrical version: it's tauter, the villains are more enigmatic, and the romance is less disjointed.",Daredevil
223,Chimera-5,"Ah, middle-American patheticness rises again!",10,26 February 2003,"I have REALLY refrained from giving an opinion here (because I figure it's more trouble than it's worth) but after all these misconstrued reviews of this film on IMDB, I can no longer resist.First of all, this film is for FANS. Comic book FANS. Not for mall trendies or people who think Scream is a real horror movie. If you're not a FAN, then don't go see it. You won't like it anymore than it wants you to be there (read: YOU'RE MONEY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH!!!).Second, comic books and their retellings on film are never meant to adhere to the ""laws of physics"" via Einstein or any psychological babble via Freud. They are meant to ENTERTAIN, and provide harmless and provacative ESCAPISM. People who beat on this film for any reasons other to entertain the hell out of it's target audience don't know how to be entertained because they won't allow themselves to. Why they even bother with films is beyond me!And last, I'm sick of people whining over the casting of Ben Affleck. Okay, so he's better looking than you and he's laying in bed with a woman you never will; sorry guys, you just have to cope. They have to cast people like him because it's next to impossible to give women ANY incentive to see films not geared towards them, so the main act has to be someone they adore, i.e. the sexiest man alive according to People Magazine. Because the sad truth is, films are business first, art second.And I notice how many people here gave Daredevil scathing reviews and didn't hesitate to give Old School complete veneration. Gee, ANOTHER beer-sex-female objectifying film, how original! Why I've haven't seen that premise a billion times over! You must all be very proud of yourselves! Middle-America, give yourselves a trite and and ordinary pat on the back for your adulation of trite and ordinary films!",Daredevil
224,emvan,A Comic Book Adaptation for Adults,7,14 February 2003,"Obviously I'm not objective about this, because I regard Frank Miller's run on Daredevil in the early 80's as the best super-hero comics ever done, period.  This isn't the fabulous movie I always imagined could be made from that material, but it is very, very, good.It is completely different in tone from other comic book adaptations, and if you go in expecting Blind Spiderman you may be sorely disappointed.  Rest assured that lukewarm reviews that find it lacking are judging it as a popcorn blockbuster, and it's not that kind of movie at all.  It is darker and much more adult; it evokes genuine emotion over the fate of its protagonists.It may be impossible to make a movie that has great comic-book style thrills and a great real human story -- developing the latter just doesn't leave enough time for the former. (You could do it in a mini-series or a weekly series, as Buffy the Vampire Slayer has proved.)  Ultimately each of the sides of Daredevil is less than perfectly satisfying.  But nevertheless it's a real treat to see them both in the same movie.  This is my second favorite comic-book adaptation, after The X-Men. 8/10.",Daredevil
225,ShinKyo81,"Back to the dark, creepy, anti-hero comic book films...",8,4 March 2003,"I'll assume at this point that everybody will have noticed the revolution that is going on in the 7th art industry: the comic books are finally getting its movie adaptations with big budgets, great special effects and involving famous actors in the way. In only 30 years, the most famous characters from the comic book world have started their career on the big screen, away from the color printed pages.First of all, there were the first low-budget productions for the TV, like the 1977's ""The Hulk"" and the first ""Spider-man"", also for the TV. Of course these flicks didn't get the quality level the fans were expecting... But it was with the first ""Superman"" that people started to look at this new world that was emerging with more interest. Because of ""Superman""'s success, the sequels' trail appeared. The 2nd installment in the flying man saga became quite pleasant, but the other two are surely forgettable... It was later in 1989 that the mad genius known as Tim Burton invited us to enter the dark, creepy world of ""Batman"", which jumped up to the best comic book films list side to side with ""Superman"".Then, there were the controversial films that appeared after the ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" success, like its respective sequels, the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" franchise and a large list of cheesy films that forgot to include the essence of the original comic book story. So everything went wrong and the adaptations became more comic than real action story.It wasn't until a young director called Bryan Singer grabbed the hand of the films and pulled them out from the grave with his incredible ""X-Men"" movie. He used a simple equation: STORY + SFX + CREDIBILITY = SUCCESS. He created a real world, but with the X-Men, making believable for the audience. Then, Sam Raimi took ""Spider-Man"" at the top of the list with its incredible version of spidey's world. Now... it's time for ""Daredevil"". Far away from the colourish world of ""Spider-man"" and the stylish action of the ""X-Men"", director Martin Steven Johnson has created a dark, creepy and crude adaptation of the world of ""DD"", which indeed the comic book is dark and creepy, too. Matt Murdock didn't receive a bite from a spider, he hasn't been exposed to gamma radiation... He lost his sight when he was 12, and lost his father later on. So, his only purpose with being ""Daredevil"" is to make justice.So we find a dark, anti-hero, who kicks ass like anybody else, but receives lots of kicking too, loses some teeth, has lots of bruises and wounds... He hasn't got any incredible alien-like superpower, only superhuman balance, amazing hearing and a kind of radar like the bat ones. But a part from this, he bleeds like a normal man.While people like famous characters playing the roles of their heros, there has been lots of complaining about Ben Affleck leading the movie as the blind ""man without fear"". Well, don't underestimate his acting abilities, 'cause seems to be fitted for Matt Murdock's character. I thought Michael Clarke Duncan was not the best candidate for playing as the Kingpin, but I changed my opinion after watching the movie. Colin Farrell is very creepy as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner is ok in  Elektra's role. So, the acting is quite good in this movie, really believable.The special effects are sometimes good, sometimes bad. You'll notice what's CGI and what's not. It reminds me Spawn and Batman in some parts, because of the dark atmosphere. Anyway, ""Daredevil"" enters into the best comic book film list with a decent position. It's not the best one, but in some parts it's far better than ""Spider-man"" and the ""X-Men"". We'll see how ""X2"" and ""The Hulk"" work.A Worth look! 8/10",Daredevil
226,furiousneon,"Finally, A Good Super Hero Movie!",10,23 February 2003,"There have been very few movie's made from comic books that ive really enjoyed. The only two that come to mind are Batman and The Crow.  X-Men and Spiderman were okay, but they both felt like they were missing something. The reason i didnt really enjoy X-Men is because i was never a fan of the comics or the tv show. Ive always been a fan of Spidey and the movie just felt like it was directed towards younger children.  Daredevil had all the qualities to make a good Super Hero flick.  Ben Affleck did surprisingly good as Matt Murdock/Daredevil.  The plot was pretty solid and the supporting cast did good.  Jennifer Garner is so beautiful that her acting abilities werent needed, but since they were, they werent bad.  Michael Clarke Duncan or whatever did a good job as Kingpin, but could have been more developed character wise, and Bullseye was awesome. Collin Farrel did a great job.  The action scenes were very well coreographed and this movie had a dark touch to it.  Daredevil was pretty violent and straight forward unlike spiderman who doesnt usually kill, just beats up and then sends to jail.  The darkness of this movie reminded me of the original Batman and The Crow.  Daredevil is a very good movie, i did enjoy this a lot more then Spiderman also.  Check this movie out, its worth 8.50 and the 2 hours of your time.",Daredevil
227,Sisiutil,"Good, but disappointing",7,1 August 2003,"Lemme break it down 3x3...What I liked:1. Ben Affleck. Affleck's taking a lot of heat these days (a lot of it deserved), but I thought he did a great job as Murdock/Daredevil, conveying the character's sightlessness as well as the inner struggle he was going through. 2. Jennifer Garner. She was probably the best thing in the movie, and not just because of her looks; I don't watch Alias, but maybe I should start.3. Action. Really well-done action sequences, and I liked how they conveyed Daredevil's perceptions--I've never even seen the comic do that effectively.What I didn't like:1. Villains. Everybody talks about how Colin Farrel steals the show. WRONG! He almost ruins it with his ridiculous, over-the-top antics. He's a clown, not a villain. Would have been better as a stone-cold killer, frankly; much more formidable a foe. And having two villains (Duncan, wasted as the Kingpin) clutters things up. 2. Choppiness. It felt like there were scenes missing, that either wound up on the editing room floor or, even worse, edited out of the script. For example, the Murdock/Elektra romance flies by way too quickly. And Daredevil takes a knife wound to the shoulder (so he's incapacitated and can't stop Bullseye from killing Elektra), and yet that same night, he's healthy enough to take down both Bullseye AND the Kingpin? I know it's based on a comic book, but this stretches the bounds of believability. Should've been an extra couple of scenes where (a) Daredevil heals at the church over a day or two and (b) the bad guys figure out where he is. THEN comes the showdown.3. Music. Utterly forgettable, especially when they throw in lame pop tunes so they can try to sell a soundtrack album. Give it up, Hollywood! Spider-Man had this problem too, though to a lesser extent. Get a talented composer and use his/her themes through the whole movie. Think James Bond: everybody and his dog can whistle that theme. Or the late 70's Superman movies. Or Star Wars. Or...you get the idea.Overall, I'd still recommend watching it, especially if you're a fan of the character, because I think a serviceable job was done bringing it to life. But Spider-Man set the standard for super-hero films, and this one falls short. 7/10.",Daredevil
228,drunken_critic,character development,8,21 November 2003,"It does not seem like DareDevil succeeded financially like Spiderman did. It was at the regular theaters for a short time, and went to the Dollar Theater pretty fast.I was not expecting much from this film coming in.  I was even prepared to not like it.  Surprisingly, I found that I did like the movie.  What I loved about this movie was the characters, especially the villains.  The villain `Bulls-Eye' was one of the best original villains I have seen in a film. It makes me wonder if he is a regular character in the marvel comic book.  I have not read the comic book, but I would like to read some with bulls-eye in it.  His skill was throwing objects with pinpoint accuracy.  There is a great scene where he is insulted at a bar.  He pulls what looks like a paperclip, and breaks it apart into little sharp pieces.  Bulls-Eye then proceeds to throw the pieces at the insulter's throat penetrating the skin. It was gruesome, but at the same time original.  Another villain `The Kingpin' reminded me of a gangster thug like Shug Knight, (Death Row Record Executive), that got his was through using his muscle, and the muscle of his minions.  These villains were convincing and not cheesy like some other characters, i.e. Mr. Freeze of Batman.Another plus in this film was the story line.  It explained the birth of Dare Devil.  He was blinded by a vat of radioactive waste after fleeing in disgust after seeing his father working for the kingpin.  The story is similar to all other super hero stories; he is a rogue vigilante that brings justice to the streets.  He is in a battle with himself, trying to fight the demons in his past.  He seems to even question if what he does is right, but he continues to do it because he feels like he is serving justice.  It is a justice he feels that cannot be provided by the judicial system and the police.Surprisingly the special effects did not wow me like they did in Spiderman. Fight scenes actually felt choppy and too edited.  They did not flow.  The story and characters made up for lack of decent computer generated effects. The villains really make the story work. 8/10",Daredevil
229,nutsy,"A YAWN WOULD BE A COMPLIMENT TO THIS. ""DAREDEVIL"" IS PURE CRAP.",1,29 October 2003,"Why the hell did anybody like this? Ben Affleck is a terrible actor. DAREDEVIL is yet another bad comic-book-movie in a long line of bad comic-book-movies. The story isn't strong, and it's poorly told. The film uses montages to pop music to convey emotion. The ""dark"" edge to this movie has such high gloss that viewers might need contacts after a sitting. The visual effects are all highly unconvincing CGI, and the hero's point of view effect is over-used. The direction is unimaginative and I've seen better scripts in Saturday morning cartoons.As if anyone should care, SPOILERS follow.Affleck's character starts the film as a poor kid (who looks like he's fresh from the pages of Tiger Beat) living with his father who is mixed up with criminals. This soon leads us to our superhero's origin. He sees something he shouldn't, drops his A+ report card (spare me!), and winds up with toxic waste in his face. He wakes up in the hospital blind, but with all his other senses heightened enough to completely compensate for it (that's why Stevie Wonder is such a bad-ass). Through the first part we have to hear Affleck's lame narration. When grows up he's a lawyer by day and DAREDEVIL the rest of the time. Naturally, he meets an attractive girl, whom he fights for some reason (think the scene in BASIC, except dumber and without gravity). She is the stuff of centerfolds, Elektra King, whose father is in trouble with the evil Kingpin, who killed Daredevil's dad, which makes him his arch nemesis. A romance blooms and the villain does villain stuff. Daredevil becomes a problem for Kingpin, so he sends in Bullseye to frame him for Elektra's daddy's murder. The frame-up scene is so incredibly dumb that Paul Verhoven probably had a laugh on it. Elektra thinks DAREDEVIL killed her daddy, so she must become a costumed freak in order to take revenge. Costumed freak Elektra really only has time to spill some sand, misuse Eastern weapons, and die. Daredevil and Bullseye fight in a cathedral. During the epic battle, scale disappears, and the pipe-organ (which they fight on) changes size and hight several times, particularly when they are falling past it. Then comes the real showdown, between Daredevil and Kingpin (the ever misused Michael Clark Duncan). Rather than do the logical thing and kill his enemy, Daredevil leaves him alive (minus his knees). Yeah, injuring a major crime lord, identifying yourself, and leaving him alive is not the smartest thing a person can do. But superheros seem pretty dumb these days anyway.Let's face it, people, BATMAN (1989) is the yardstick to which all superhero movies and comic book adaptations must be measured. Nothing has ever measured up (except maybe DICK TRACY). X-MEN, X2, HULK, SPIDERMAN, and DAREDEVIL are all crap, both by comparison and by their value as films. Anyone who thinks DAREDEVIL is good is either plain stupid, or an obsessed fan who shouldn't be listened to anyway. To yawn at this movie would be a compliment.",Daredevil

The strangely poor casting? Check. How about the fact that this movie falls down exactly when it shouldn't? You know what the weakest part of this flick is? The action scenes. Aside from the fact that all but one of them are hideously poorly lit (perhaps the cinematographer thought the audience should identify with the blind protagonist?) there's no tension, no long shots which allow us to view the action and appreciate the mobility of these supposedly athletic characters. What we get instead is some very poorly timed wirework, and some inhuman looking CGI. The Matrix this ain't. Sad. Strangely, the only parts of this movie that worked were some of the dramatic scenes. In particular, Ben Affleck's early interactions with his partner at the law firm remind us that there is an actor hiding in this movie, underneath the leather grope suit. Sadly, he's not allowed to come out and do his thing. D+",Daredevil

Mess up the origin, camp up the characters, but more oftenly is not staying true to the source material. 'Daredevil' is SO faithful to the comic book that director Mark Steven Johnson made the complicated task look easy. The grit of Hell's Kitchen is there. The grace of DD swinging through the streets of New York are there. And the tone and message of justice are there as well. The movies villains, Kingpin and Bullseye are absolutly perfect. Especially Colin Farrell's Bullseye. He gives his small role a powerful punch. He plays the maniac assassin with enough anger and psychoticness, and also manages not to go too over the top. Ben Affleck also proves to be the quintessiental Matt Murdock/Daredevil. Any doubts he could pull it off were put to bed. Jennifer Garner was THE perfect choice for Elektra. She's beautiful, graceful, and could kick serious butt. The story is plays very much like a comic book story. The only problem I had was that the movie was too short. It packed a lot into 90 minutes and could have played out better if given the extra half hour. I can understand those who didn't like the movie because they aren't either comic fans or DD fans. Or both. But those who are, are in for quite the rush. The fight scenes were the best, hands down of any comic movie. And the final fight between DD and Bullseye was all that any fan could ask for. I really hope they make a sequel. Because its a great oppertunity to expose the Daredevil legend to more than just comic fans.RATING:*** out of ****",Daredevil

The director does a horrible job of making an impression on the audience. This is perhaps the first time many people will see Daredevil and instead of giving him a big entrance he doesn't. People always say that it's important to make a good first impression. Obviously the filmmakers here didn't know that.
The film itself I felt was good. Could have been better if the studio wouldn't have cut the film so much to avoid the R rating but it was good enough. The performances by Ben Affleck as Daredevil and Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin were great. What disappoints me is since this film was produced by FOX the Kingpin won't make an appearance in the Spider-Man franchise. Now my favorite performance was by the sexy Jennifer Garner as Electra.

237,stu9003,"Too many characters, too little time",5,23 February 2003,"Daredevil is loosely based on an acclaimed series of Daredevil stories written by Frank Miller back in the 80's. Miller's Daredevil was noted for being much darker and more violent than most other comics appearing at that time. During his run on the comic, Miller also introduced Elektra, who in addition to being a deadly assassin, was also Daredevil's enemy and lover. Having enjoyed those stories, I wanted to enjoy the movie as well, but I didn't.One of the problems is that the movie can't seem to decide whether to be a straight adaptation or something different altogether. There are scenes in the movie that are taken word for word from the comic, but without the proper buildup or background, these scenes often don't make any sense. Elektra is a prime example. The movie never seems to decide whether she's the deadly assassin we see in the comics or just another helpless damsel in distress. At times, such as in her playground fight with Matt Murdock, and also in her final battle with Daredevil, she resembled the Elektra from the comics. In all the scenes in between, however, she was just another helpless damsel in distress. I get the impression the director looked through his Daredevil comic collection, picked out all of his favourite scenes, and then tried to cram them all into one 90 minute movie. One of the big reasons that Spiderman was such a success for me is the fact that they kept it very simple and didn't try to do too much. There was just one hero, one villain, a few supporting characters, and that's it. This gave them enough time and space to develop the characters and story. In Daredevil, there are simply too many characters introduced and none of them get enough time on screen. I think they should have gotten rid of a few of the characters (Kingpin and Ben Urich), added about 20 minutes or so, and then just focused on DD, Elektra and Bullseye. On individual performances, I didn't think any of the actors did poorly given the circumstances. Jennifer Garner showed potential as Elektra (her playground fight with Matt Murdock was by far the best scene in the movie) but her character was poorly developed and made little sense. And, given what he had to work with, Ben Affleck didn't do too badly as Matt Murdock.The special effects and fight scenes were OK, but both have been done better elsewhere.",Daredevil

239,thetheonly,One of the weakest marvel films of all time,3,4 October 2019,"This film might have been okay back in the early 2000s but in retrospect it's one of the weakest films you could watch based on the comics. The plot to this film is very loosely based upon the comics but outside of a Stan Lee cameo there isn't much fan service. My main issue is starting with the acting and characters. First Ben Affleck does a below average as an actor in this film. His character of Matt Murdoch aka Daredevil is completely off, first Matt is supposed to be an amazing lawyer but that is not displayed at all in the court scene, next throughout the film Daredevul says he's a good guy which is repetitive and also he murders a guy which his character would normally never do. Nedt bullseye in the film is super cheesey and nothing like his character in the comics, and the overacting is awfully atrocious but he is still the best part in the film despite how awful the performance is. Now a very brief synopsis and events of the film, the movies first bit is told in a really cheap flashback that doesn't add much and could be a lot better. Next it follows Matt in day to day life and his escapades as Daredevul at night. Eventually the movie ends with him, I think killing bullseye and proceeding to cripple the Kingpin with him saying ""I'm not the bad guy"" obviously since he's done nothing wrong. The only reason I'm not giving the movie a 1 is because bullseye is somewhat entertaining and the film being a product of it's time.",Daredevil

If this film had been in Chinese, set in Hong Kong & featured actors like Jet Li, Donnie Yen & Maggie Cheung & had some decent fight scenes & wasn't trying to be BATMAN & was directed by someone like Tsui Hark then mabey this ultra lame script could've worked. With such Wonderbread non-entities like Jennifer Garner & Ben Affleck on hand however this tiresome tale falls flat. The one thing I'll hand to the the filmmakers: they actually were able to make Joe Pantoliano & Michael Clarke Duncan boring, which is no mean feat. This cheapo sub B flick looks like a reject from the Made for The SciFi Channel universe. Blech!!",Daredevil
241,tshodan,Ben Affleck cant act!,5,23 April 2003,"Daredevil was a somewhat entertaining film, somewhat cool effects good characters, that is except for the lead.  Affleck was horrible, it was like watching paint dry everytime he tried to act.   Kingpin was done quite well by Clarke, surpassing expectations as he was to overcome a racial expection. Bullseye was fantastic as well.  electra was alright, but in that outfit, I wasnt paying attention to her acting.My only issue with this film, besides Affleck cant Act, was that again our director confuses which superheroes hes working with, this is DareDevil, not Spiderman.  He isnt 10 times stronger and faster than a normal human, and even if you could hear a trigger being pulled, you cant dodge a machine gun.",Daredevil
242,RandomTask-AP,Flawed Director's Cut Vastly Improves the Theatrical Release,6,16 June 2005,"The struggle between art and commerce is rarely more fiery than in Hollywood. Investors have fronted tens of millions of dollars to a project. The director and crew are focused on presenting a vision with specific nuances. At the end is supposed to be a magnificent presentation of a 120-minute piece of entertainment that rewards both financially and artistically. The crossroads trying to get to that end is where the original release of ""DareDevil"" got turned into dream factory road-kill.With the successes of ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" under its belt, Marvel Comics put ""DareDevil"" into production for release in 2003. The story is that of another adolescent whose emotionally-charged life is thrown into further chaos by an encounter with a scientific experiment. Young Matt Murdoch loses his sight, but gains enhancements to his other 4 senses. After watching his boxer father fall to mob corruption, he grows into Matt Murdoch (Ben Affleck) the Lawyer and simultaneously DareDevil, vigilante protector to the Hell's Kitchen section of New York. He meets and has a romance with Elektra (Jennifer Garner) who comes to blame DareDevil for her father's murder. Bullseye (Colin Farrell) is the real assassin under contract to the wicked Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan). The self-imposed service to do justice brings Murdoch/DareDevil into confrontation with all three. As exciting and melodramatic as that set-up sounds, the film did not measure up to Marvel's previous big screen adventures. With a healthy history to draw upon, you'd think the story about these characters would be a lock. Yet the theatrical release fell right on its face to both reviewers and fans. What was the factor that failed to coalless? Later that year, the DVD version of Mark Steven Johnson's director's cut was released and answered many questions.The director's cut fulfills what was a half-baked mess in the theatrical release. The first half had plenty of the comic book character spirit, but it began to show serious flaws at the midpoint. Characters were making wild decisions and never connected with the audience. It made everything that happened at the climax seem all the more ridiculous. The director's cut removes the forced and frivolous romantic scenes between Matt and Elektra and replaces them with scenes that develop their dynamic while more naturally leading toward romance. The inventive special effect of seeing the world through Matt's ""radar sense"" is used more often and more effectively during scenes of both action and conversation. An entire subplot eliminated from the original release involving a criminal who is wrongly accused, adds a crucial mystery and brings the characters of Foggy Nelson (John Favreau as Matt's legal partner), Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano as a hard-nosed reporter) and Wilson Fisk/The Kingpin completely into their roles. Before they appeared to be nothing more than character names to validate that a generic action film was a Marvel product. With Mark Steven Johnson's screenplay and original vision restored, the story remains generally the same but now all the puzzle pieces fit together completely. In a featurette on the DVD, the producers and director all discuss how they debated about story versus running time. For the theatrical version, it was deemed more important to jazz up the story with more romance and cut scenes for speed. Some problems remain with the director's cut. There are moments of overstatement in script and execution. The transitional scenes of Matt donning his crime-fighting outfit and hurtling off rooftops on his way to intercept a guilty man are unnecessary and diffuse the threat of his appearance in the next scene. The script sometimes explains too much with DareDevil muttering to himself that he is not the bad guy. It is a much more poignant display of his inner turmoil when he deliberately brushes past a pair of his father's boxing gloves upon returning from a night of dispensing his brand of street justice. The special effects also stretch when they are used to show human characters performing super feats without explanation. Super hearing and aim with even Olympic-level training does not allow anyone to leap 15 feet straight up or across a 30-foot avenue. This just detracts from the grittiness set up early on, but is, admittedly, part of the comic book fun. Fortunately, more actual stunts and fight choreography are restored.The better elements remain. There is Colin Farrell's domineering presence as the deliberate and remorseless Bullseye. He is that villainous combination of creepy and cool. Farrell makes the character from the comic live and breathe menace with minimal dialogue. Over the last two years, Ben Affleck has eroded his acting career in the public eye with many low-level films, and the first release of ""DareDevil was among them. However, when all is revealed, we find that Affleck gives a dark and tortured performance beyond a matinée idol in a leather suit. Examples are DareDevil shown paying physical prices for his adventures; suffering the loss of an old girlfriend to his emotional distance as she breaks up with him by answering machine; and is ignoring the screams of a nearby victim so he can be enveloped in the blissful oblivion of sleep.Director Johnson expressed his regret at the decisions to make cuts, but also his love for both versions of the film. For those who enjoyed the original version, there is much more to see here. Those in the camp of disappointment should consider giving the director's cut a viewing because it amounts to more than the sum of its missing parts. It's just a shame that Hollywood commerce overran the artist, and we're paying twice to see the real show.Theatrical Release: 4 out of 10 Director's Cut: 8 out of 10 Entire Movie-Going Experience: 6 out of 10",Daredevil
243,templar77099,"So, now Matt Murdock has superpowers?",5,1 July 2015,"I wanted to watch this since a long time ago. I remember watching it while I was a kid and found it kinda cool. The scene that always stucked into my mind when I thought about ""Daredevil"" was the confrontation between Matt and Fisk, one of the last scenes of the movie. The problem is that, before I watched this (today) I had seen the Netflix series which I can assure to the ones out there who have not seen it is indeed really good,with some of the best fight sequences you will ever find on a TV series or even in any superhero related content.I loved it so much that I watched the movie only to see if the majority of people were right in hating it. I can say I wasn't too much surprised with the hate.I can't really get the point of the director, the way he shot the scenes, the way he made Daredevil portrayal. If I hadn't watched the series I would have got the idea that Daredevil is really a superhero, with real superpowers. Half of the film is watching a shameful CGI version of Ben Affleck jumping around Hell's Kitchen like if he was Superman. One could even say that he was not jumping but flying. Before re-watching the movie and as I didn't have great memories of it, I thought that Mark Steven Johnson would had tried to do a more realistic ground-based movie and a CGI filled one. I don't know if CGI was the only thing audiences payed attention in 2003, but I think that the director could had chosen a different way of making this flick. Even the fight scenes that I hoped that could be at least a bit entertaining were boring with bad editing, except the ones near the end (Bullseye vs Elektra - Bullseye vs Matt and Fisk vs Matt).I'd say that Ben Affleck fits the character but I didn't see much commitment from him. Jennifer Garner is sexy, yes, and hot, but that doesn't make her portrayal of Elektra exceptional. Michael Clarke Duncan gives what is asked of him, a strong and fearsome Kingpin who can destroy anyone who crosses his way.Despite being a bit nonsensical, campy even, the performance I most like was the one of Colin Farrell. I don't know how the Bullseye from the comics is but I liked his part very much.Then we have Jon Favreau in a early stage of his career as ""Foggy"", Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urich and Leland Orser as Wesley but I think they don 't add much to the overall of the movie.I give 5/10 to the film because it's not brilliant and it also isn't a complete disgrace with the last 30 minutes being quite enjoyable. So, if you want to see it I'd advice to jump to an hour and half in because that is were the juicy stuff is.",Daredevil

No doubt.Do I sometimes like to eat McDonald's? Yeah, but less and less.Why in God's name would a vigilante leave his initials on the ground in over-sized letters, but do so with flammable liquid that no one would see unless someone happened to drop a match? And then, apparently, do this flammable liquid thing only once? And where is he getting this flammable liquid?How is it that characters in movies go out into the middle of a huge city like New York and manage to just find each other effortlessly even though no rondezvous was arranged prior to their meeting?How does an unmarried blind man go to law school and become a world class athlete in his spare time without starving to death in the process?I mean, I know it's based on a comic book, but all the more reason to ground your implausible precepts in a universe that otherwise makes sense, right?I mean I'm GIVING the filmmakers their assertion that a guy who is blinded by chemicals in a freak accident as a child, who then develops super-duper radar and can use it to leap from rooftop to rooftop would still need a cane to navigate street traffic on the ground. All I ask is that your goofy ideas are at least INTERNALLY consistent. See 'The Matrix' for a good example of this.***This paragraph contains a spoiler*** Additionally, I think it's asking entirely too much of my ability to suspend disbelief when you try to tell me a vigilante develops a conscience about killing scumbags just as he is presented with the opportunity to kill the man who ordered the deaths of his own father, his hot-ass girlfriend, as well as her father. I'd kill the SOB on principle alone. I mean come on. I would have respected the character a whole lot more if he'd said something like ""I'm not killing anyone again -- after tonight"" and then kicked the guy out the window. I think that would have been truer to the character's down-and-dirty persona. I mean that unbelievably bodacious babe from 'Alias' was stabbed through the tummy because of this guy. But whatever.Yeah, it had some cool fight scenes, kinda. And it moved along at a good clip and it was never really boring. I guess that's good.

245,bujinbudoka,"Nitty and Gritty, Affleck was born to play Matt Murdock",9,2 December 2006,"OK, I'm a die-hard fan of comics and the movies which come from them. Sadly too often a director gets a hold of one and changes so much stuff it actually takes away from what made the story great to begin with.The major changes here? Kingpin is black and played by Michael Clarke Duncan (very well too I might add) and Bullseye has a bullseye carved into his forehead (in the comics it was part of his costume) Aside from those two minor things, this movie is spot on with the legend of Daredevil, the Man without Fear! The story takes place around the life of Matt Murdock, a blind attorney who, as an adolescent was exposed to radioactive liquids which blinded him, yet granted his other remaining senses superhuman qualities (i.e. the best being his radar-sense which works through his hearing.) Growing up to become a lawyer Matt takes his fight to the street at night in Hell's Kitchen, his neighborhood, as Daredevil. Enter Elektra Natchios, the daughter to a wealthy businessman and partner to Kingpin, and you have the beginnings of a truly great comic book story about one man's fight to see justice served! The movie actually captured the feeling of the comics I felt, probably as good as Spiderman. Ben Affleck shines as the tormented lawyer who diligently stands by his choice to be both a lawyer by day and a vigilante at night. 9 out of 10 stars.",Daredevil

The film is good, not great like the Spider-Man franchise. The acting is superb. The story is easy to follow. The film felt too dark for me, and for my taste in Super Hero films. One thing's for sure, unlike Spidey, Daredevil has NO sense of humor. Same with Batman. No humor. This is an OK movie for Comic fans. But, otherwise, I'd recommend skipping this one altogether, along with Bryan Singer's trashy movie, Superman Returns. Daredevil felt a lot darker too me than Spider-Man 3. I loved Spider-Man 3, absolutely loved it!! Daredevil is, decent. Christopher Reeve's Superman films, I'v always loved those. Bright, funny, exciting. Spidey, same as Superman.

The acting was suprisingly solid,costumes weren't too awful flashy,and the storyline stayed pretty true to character (for those of us that do care about that sort of thing). Complaint: SPOILER...If I have to complain about anything,the fight scene in the park with Elektra was way goofy. The fact that she only got suspicious about Matt when he sidesteps a puddle AFTER the amazing fight she just had with a BLIND GUY in the park seemed too far fetched and an insult to her intelligence..not to mention the viewers'.

A man who is totally blind, and relies only on his other senses, which are now super senses, it could be a really good movie, but it wasn't, but like i said not the worst by far.

I am not an avid reader of his comics but I am  somewhat familiar with them, and Daredevil was well done.  This movie had many action sequences that reminded me of Spiderman but the whole movie had a dark, moody feel that reminded me of Blade.Ben Affleck was very believable as Daredevil, while Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan were perfectly cast as the villains.  I was also very impressed by the bumbling John Favreau and the beautiful Jennifer Garner. Kevin Smith's scene was a pleasant surprise and Stan Lee made his usual humorous cameo.This movie is certainly not without flaws.  I didn't think the character development of Daredevil, Elektra or Bullseye were strong enough and I wish they would have had more scenes with the villains.  I didn't get enough of a feel for the characters.  And as great as the action sequences were, I didn't think there were enough of them.Overall, I found this movie quite enjoyable and entertaining.  I can't help but compare it to Spiderman because of the fight scenes but the film's atmosphere is not light-hearted like the aforementioned film.

253,on_the_can,"cool movie, better director's cut",8,1 June 2006,"I enjoyed this movie a lot when I first saw it. It was a fun movie with lots of action and a cool dark sense of humor. It also had a really cool visual look, director Mark Steven Johnson was heavily influenced by not only Daredevil comics, but comic books in general and it shows. The story didn't necessarily blow me off my ass but it was strong enough to keep me interested and support the action and there was some cool changes that happen to hero over the course of the film.BUT then I saw the director's cut and wow. Almost every thing is beefed up at least a little, the fights are a bit longer, there's more jokes and establishing shots, and the rating goes from PG-13 to R. But most importantly an entire subplot that was cut from the original release was added in and it takes the story to a whole new level. The subplot involves a drug addict who's been wrongfully accused of murder and has Matt Murdock and Frank Nelson assigned to him as his defense attorneys. The plot interweaves through out the entire movie, and not only does it add much more character to Matt and Frank (specifically Frank) but it also ties very tightly to KingPin, his assistant, and the reporter Ben Urich. All of it helps to make the story more coherent and realistic and also answers some questions that were originally left hanging.So ya I liked the movie before, but now I can't imagine watching the original cut and I hope that if (and I hope they do) make a sequel they'll use this version as their springboard, and keep that layered and extra gritty feel.",Daredevil
254,xgray-03873,"Not Really a Masterpiece, But I Actually Did Enjoyed the Director's Cut!",8,4 May 2017,"Well, after watching the director's cut of the 2003 Daredevil movie, I would have to say that it's not really a masterpiece, but I will say that it's better than the theatrical cut. But, it's not the worst superhero movie that I've ever seen. That honor belongs to Catwoman (2004), X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Superman III & IV and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Now with that being said, as far as movie casting goes in a superhero film such as Daredevil, I have to say that Jennifer Garner is a terrible choice for the role of Elektra Natchios. Not once did I actually believe that she was the famous ninja assassin from the Daredevil comics that single-handed took out the Hand. All I saw was Jennifer Garner in a black leather corset playing with ninja weapons and I actually laughed at her death scene at the hands of Colin Farrell's Bull's-Eye. The rest of the cast is alright. The late Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin was amazing, Colin Farrell was a hoot as Bull's-Eye. But, I think Ben Affleck should've just stuck with playing Batman, instead of Daredevil. This was not an easy role for him at all.Overall, I'd highly recommend the Director's Cut of the 2003 Daredevil movie over the Theatrical Cut. It's definitely worth the watch. Oh, and I forgot! The director's cut features a subplot with Coolio's character being framed by the Kingpin and it is hilarious.",Daredevil

257,robert-300,A waste of an hour and a half of my life,2,6 August 2003,"* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant WARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*  Earlier this year saw the release of yet another big screen adaptation of a comic strip character.This time it was one of the lesser known creations that came from the pages of Stan Lee's Marvel comics.This character was none other than 'Daredevil'. Helmed by little known Director and screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson who penned the script, it tells the story of Matt Murdock(Ben Affleck).An idealistic lawyer Murdock attempts to put those criminals who pray on the innocent behind bars rather than try and make a quick buck getting them off the hook.In short he is a lawyer with a conscience.A rare thing in today's society.What makes him especially unique however is the fact that he is blind and a costumed vigilante going by the name of 'Daredevil'.How is this possible? When Matt was a young boy growing up in the streets of New York's Hell's Kitchen he was involved in an accident involving a huge drum of chemical waste.The drum sprung a leak, squirting Matt in the eyes and permanently blinding him.However when he was blinded,Matts remaining senses somehow became razor sharp.Giving him an uncanny kind of radar sense.Matt then went on to train his body his other senses so that he could use them more effectively.Turning himself in to a human fighting machine. Shortly after he gains these powers, Matts father(David Keith)a struggling two-bit boxer who was forced to become a loan shark for the mob is killed when he refuses to take a dive under the orders of the mobs evil leader.From that day Matt swears that he will use his powers to protect the innocent and the poor.Those people who cannot afford justice.It is then that he becomes 'Daredevil'. Director Mark Steven Johnsons ode to one of Marvel comics more obscure characters is a unquestionable mess from beginning to end.Johnson has only him self to blame here.After all not only did he direct this but he also wrote the script.Giving his movie just over an hour and a half of running time he gives himself little time to fully and successfully incorporate all of the movies most important characters in to the story.(What there is of it).Johnson spends so much time telling the story of how the Daredevil's origins,his current life as a lawyrer and in developing his relationship with love interest Elektra King(Jennifer Garner)that when he gets round to the villains he leaves little time to give them much to do.Bullseye(Colin Farrel)the Irish assassin with a talent for turning any object in to a lethal weapon is poorly constructed as a character and is never given any real motivation.He comes across as a sadly two-dimensional character.Farrel is fantastic never the less and clearly tries to have fun with what is a badly written,under used character.Michael Clarke Duncan as the movies chief villain, the crime boss Wilson Fisk aka Kingpin is also under used.We again get a badly developed character without any real motivation.He is just simply bad.It is never fully explained why he wants Elektra's father killed.It's as if Johnson simply want's us to just accept it.Duncan never the less does a good enough job under the circumstances. As for the action sequences.They don't come very often.A mistake made again by the film's far too short running time.When they do come along they're either too short or ropey for my liking. As for the romance between Matt and Elektra.I couldn't help but feel that it was all a little too forced and rushed.They both fall in love far too quickly.Affleck is passable in the lead roll.He makes for a stead fast enough hero while Garner is indeed engaging and not with out charm as Elektra.I found it hard to feel any sympathy for Matt however and feel any justification for him becoming 'Daredevil'.He comes across at times as being a scared little boy who can't get over the fact that his fathers death was mostly the old man's own fault.Instead he puts the blame completely on the shoulders of the crooks.His father couldn't seem to take his own advice and get a good steady job.Instead he becomes a crooked loan shark to make ends meet and is eventually killed because he was too stupid to take a dive in a fight like any one in their right mind would have done. In the end 'Daredevil' suffers from a poorly constructed screenplay.It lacks any real pace and is quite simply all over the place.Johnson clearly knows little about character development and how to make a well paced sturdy action adventure movie.If this is any thing to go by I can only hope that Johnsons stint in Hollywood is a short lived one.Robs Rating: *",Daredevil
258,SnobbyDude,One of best of its kind,10,18 February 2003,"This movie is a lot of fun.  It's fun to watch, looks great, sounds great and never gets boring.  I've already seen it twice and am probably going to see it more often in the theaters.  A lot of people compare it to Spiderman, but I thought it was a better movie.  I find it darker, grittier, and more serious.  We also get much more interesting villains here.  Daredevil is, without a doubt, one of the best of its kind.  I love comic book movies, so I loved this movie.  10/10",Daredevil
259,Logic404,Theatrical - 7 Director's cut - 7 (It does depend on taste).,8,7 January 2007,"I've just finished watching the director's cut (I've seen the theatrical version 3 times). If you want faster pacing but less story go with theatrical. But if you want a almost fully fleshed out story and slightly more cohesive action scenes then the director's cut is for you. I feel that both offer different but just as good rewards.I have to mention the reason I think this movie gets less than decent ratings on this site is because of Affleck. Since this movie was released back in '03 Ben's career has taken a down slide in the public eye. As long as an actor does his/her job it shouldn't (and in my eyes)does not affect how I rate or view a movie. So take my rating's as unbiased.The Good: Stylish action scenes, good atmosphere at most times, mostly fair acting and a grittier and darker vision than most superhero/comic book movies.The Bad: Some really cheesy and stupid scenes, some awkwardly said lines, some weaker music on some scenes and like I said about the theatrical version a not so filled out plot.I almost forgot: I really liked the way Bullseye's character was played. It really looked like Colin Farrell was having a fun time making this and it carries over into the viewing experience.So with either version you can't go wrong but if I had to pick one I'd go with the Director's Cut.",Daredevil
260,Jester69,Kingpin is not BLACK!!!,7,17 March 2003,"I thought this was one of the best comic films ever and I was never a Daredevil or Affleck fan.  But, I am a comic fan and and Kingpin is not black.  I'm not racist but making Kingping black is like making Spiderman black, you just don't do it.  If you never read the comics, then it will work for you but if you read them you are expecting a big fat white guy!!! I think Michael Clarke Duncan is a good actor but he is not Kingpin. Other than that, I thought the film was excellent!!! Why not have Brad Pitt play Blade in Blade 3??",Daredevil
261,shortround8391,Pretty Good,10,21 May 2007,"For some reason, critics everywhere HATE this film, let me guess is it because of Affleck? Ben actually did a decent job acting as the blind lawyer Matt Murdock who hunts down evildoers at night as the crimson leather wearing Daredevil and also called ""The Man Without Fear"". The fight scenes were really good and Jon Favreau who plays as Matt's friend Foggy Nelson can really act when it comes for comic relief which is what every superhero film needs, especially the darker tone ones.Unlike Spiderman, Daredevil is definitely not all ""rainbows and flowers"" and DD is isolated, you'll see that he has all the horrible stuff going on with him, broken teeth, scars and constantly taking painkillers, he is also shown to be poor since his clients are also poor and have to pay them with (in Foggy Nelson's words) ""Fish, wheels of cheese, and sports supplies"", he also barely has anyone by his side except for Foggy. Affleck clearly shows us what his character is going through, which is why he is a talented actor.The villains were also cool, Bullseye and Kingpin were total BAD@$$. Bullseye is a maniac, and I mean a MANIAC. He is a also very unique bad guy, he has the best aim and accuracy than anyone else and in the movie he kills a smartmouth old man by throwing a paper clip to his throat (which was pretty cool). Kingpin is pretty much the ""tough guy"" here and killed two of his bodyguards in cold blood (only seen in the Directors Cut).Although Daredevil is good I highly recommend you seeing the Directors Cut which is, like, ten times better than the original since the fight scenes are longer and has a subplot of which Matt defends a (not really) innocent man played by Coolio which eventually leads to the discovery that respected buisnessman Wilson Fisk is actually the ruthless guy who runs all the crime in the town named the Kingpin.Later, Dudes",Daredevil
262,Eightiesjunkie,"Criminally underrated, Gem of a movie!",10,26 August 2003,"To this day, I do not understand why this movie was hated so much. Since seeing this movie, I have become a hardcore Daredevil Fan. If you've ever read any of the Daredevil graphic novels by Frank Miller, I believe you will like this movie. (Unless you detest Ben Affleck, but I'll get into that later.) Aside from a few changes here and there, this movie follows the Frank Miller graphic novels perfectly. If you want to see a comic book movie done right, look no further. This is it! I may be a little bit biased because Daredevil is my favorite Marvel superhero, but aside from that, I think that this movie is better than Spider-Man, X-Men, The Hulk, or X2. Now getting to the argument concerning Ben Affleck. Many people bashed this film because Ben Affleck stars as Matt Murdock/Daredevil. The thing is, people just can't picture him as Daredevil. Well, that's the whole point! In the comics, People don't suspect that Matt Murdock is Daredevil because he is blind, the same principle applies to Peter Parker or Clark Kent. People don't suspect them as superheroes because they act shy or weak. What the comics are saying is: Someone you least expect could be a hero. It's true that Ben Affleck has been in some bad movies, but he's been in some fantastic ones as well, and this is one of them. If you're a fan of Daredevil, or just want to be entertained, Watch this movie!",Daredevil

But when his father dies in the alley from an unknown gang, Matt Murdock avenges his father's death by becoming ""The Man Without Fear"" himself Daredevil.Ben Affleck is the main protagonist of the movie and me personality while I don't think he's a good impression as Daredevil, he does do a good job as Matt Murdock, the Kingpin is played by Michael Clarke Duncan who also did a good job of his performance, Jon Favreau as Foggy is the typical comic relief, and as for Jennifer Garner and Colin Farrell they were both not the right casting for their characters, I never believed that Jennifer fits perfectly for the role of Electra and Colin as Bullseye is just over the top to me.If you watch the Theatrical version of the film you'll basically get nothing but a bland and brainless action comic book film of the early 2000s (which I give it 4/10 stars), but the Director's Cut is the one that I'm reviewing because I felt it does help with the story. I wouldn't spoil all the details of what it is, but simply put is that some of the cuts makes the film like a crime drama than the typical good versus evil. There are other cut clips in the first that are nice to see, while some of them I personally felt doesn't necessarily need to be seen on the director's cut.Overall: Other than the cut clips that does help stand the movie up a little, there are few things of the movie I enjoyed seeing, like the blind scenes and some of the fight scenes were nice, but I still have some downside about the film such as the effect isn't all that good and at times the film tends to have its corny moment, but while the movie does has that early 2000s cliche, I still gave it a chance and I would recommend only the Director's Cut and not the Theatrical version.",Daredevil

However, if you are a huge comic book fan as I am, you are sure to get your money's worth with this comic book blockbuster.Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdock, a blind attorney who becomes Daredevil, the man without fear, and a crusader for justice in the walls of Hell's Kitchen. Jennifer Garner plays Electra in a performance that was allright, neither great nor awful, Michael Clark Duncan plays Kingpin, an underworld crimelord who is really BIG, and Colin Ferrell steals every scene that he is in as Bullseye, the assassin who almost NEVER misses his target.The coolest effect of the film is seeing the world from Daredevil's point of view with his ""radar"" sense!While the special effects were allright, the action scenes were terrific, and the film never slowed down.
Once again another top notch comic book to film translation. Marvel is on a very hot streak and with X-Men 2 and The Hulk hitting theaters this summer, expect films based on comic book heroes to keep churning out of Hollywood.A 10 on a scale of 1-10!",Daredevil

The best scenes were badly stolen from better films like Batman and Spider-Man. Yeah, those two films are often mentioned in the reviews and there's a reason for it. The few original ideas weren't convincing. Unbelievable characters, overthetop action but so dark, you can't see a friggin' thing. And for the record, I don't hate Ben Affleck. I even think he did fairly good jobs in his prior movies. Anyway, the story was plainly bad and there were scenes that assume that you have no brain. Also, the whole film seemed to be so heavily edited... it might be that it was a decent movie ... before they slaughtered it... I can't really say. 2 / 10 Points.",Daredevil
267,raven_blood88,Repulsive... at best...,1,22 April 2007,"This movie brings shame to Hollywood in the worst way. It's just such a terrible movie in comparison to 'X-Men' and 'X-2' or 'Spiderman' and 'Spiderman 2'. Those movies were well done and did a good job with their CGI. They had good characters that grabbed your attention, and real, genuine villains who were exciting and deadly.This movie failed in those aspects. *Spoilers ahead (if there is anything to spoil)* The beginning is nothing but a back-story, acted out by a boy who is very boring. Then, it shifts to the real story, which is even more boring. So boring, I can't even remember it all.All I remember is Ben Affleck plays a dull and unemotional Daredevil, who meets a random girl at a restaurant. They talk for a few minutes, fight in an alley, and then go home and have sex. Call me crazy, but I think it's highly unlikely that a couple would fall in love that fast.Then, a baddie kills her dad and makes Daredevil look like he did it. So, she blames him, hates him, trains for days to kill him, and then becomes convinced that he didn't do it within ten minutes of fighting him.Then, she dies, and Daredevil wants to avenge her death.He goes to fight the baddie, beats him up, and discovers that the baddie works for the BIG BADDIE!! Ooo! Shocker! Then, he fights the big baddie (who also killed his father), and has a strong and believable motive to kill him. But he doesn't, even though the baddie killed his father and girlfriend, because he's a wuss.He breaks his knees and has him carted off to jail, but the movie's ending is open, and it leaves you wondering 'what the heck even happened?' The baddies in 'X-Men/X-2' are good villains, and the good guys spare them because they are convincing and interesting good guys. And in 'Spiderman/Spiderman 2', though the villains die, they are portrayed in a good way, and they don't die by the hands of the good guy.But Daredevil is never portrayed as a good guy. He kills baddies for crying out loud. So, it seems out of character that he wouldn't kill the big baddie.The only cool character in the movie was the priest. He ruled the whole thing, and I enjoyed his character. Other than that, it spilled chunks.1/10.",Daredevil
268,codeE,What dumb ass decided on the theatrical cut?,8,9 February 2005,"I cant understand how anyone who saw the directors cut and the theatrical cut could chose the theatrical cut. Have you ever seen a movie on TV and then rented it and said, ""Gee that version on TV was way better."" Usually the directors cut of a movie contains a few extras maybe some alternative scenes but not an entirely different movie. Was it the R-rating they were afraid of. I personally would rather watch a good movie than a bad one. Who ever the ""they"" are they deserve the title dumb ass. Most comics deal with weighty themes and contain a level of maturity. They are written and drawn by adults. Some in the movie industry don't understand this. They prefer to play it safe, cash in and ignore the source.

Add to the mix the Gullermo Del Toro style of frenzied cutting and you have a film that quite literally made me motion sick.The direction was extremely poor, and there are so many incidences of this it's impossible for me to pick out a specific reference.The script seems to lack coherent plotting or dialogue. Some of the dialogue is so poor that it defies belief. The only consistency is the fact that it's totally inconsistent. I've seen more holes in swiss cheese: the plot is so bad.The heavy metal sound track and the obvious product placements either detract or just simply annoy.Also, the comic book characters were human, with all the skills and weaknesses that go with it.

271,eddy_currents,"Good, but damn! it could be so much better",7,18 February 2003,"X-Men and Spiderman were great movies on several levels. Action, entertainment, character development (although Cyclops got short shrift, they should have left in his deleted scenes that you can see on the DVD). And they are good comic book adaptations. The best part of the Batman movies was the atmosphere, the movies themselves were only okay.Daredevil is entertaining but fails to live up to its potential. It has the atmosphere of Batman, the action of X-Men, and the character development of Spiderman -- but only for one character. The villains barely get any screen time and come across as two dimensional (no joke intended).Farrell uses intensity to make up for what little screen time he has, and Duncan is big and fearsome (good choice for Kingpin). However, they really needed some backstory and motivation.The token female / love interest stumbled a bit. The love scenes were clever, but when she had to fight she was sometimes equal to Daredevil, then not, depending on whether she had to be a strong modern woman or a damsel in distress. Combining both into one character didn't work.The action plot was linear and a little boring, but the main conflict was internal to Daredevil, and that was done well.There were some excellent points that made up for the flaws. They spent some time on the buddy scenes with Murdock's law partner, and they were terrific. Affleck did a good job with the character, showing his inner strength and his inner turmoil. I really liked the way they depicted Daredevil's ""radar"" and how he fought. Having a blind hero was a nice change, and they showed his strengths (scent, sound) and his weaknesses (loud noises, needing sound for his radar to work). There were little touches showing the life of a blind man, such as having to fold his bills in specific ways before putting them in his wallet. The ending with the reporter was also a refreshing anti-cliche.In this era of long movies I have no idea why they didn't add another 10 or 20 minutes. Marvel is a gold mine right now, the producers had to know they would make it back. This movie would have been so much better if we could have spent more time with the characters.",Daredevil

Jennifer Garner and Erick Avari (as the girl and her father) do the only decent acting among a cast that has every ability to do much better. When seeing 'Daredevil', I come to think how a blind man, though sharp senses, jumps 300 feet and catches a pole no wider than the regular at the playground. I wouldn't and I see well. Secondly, everyone seem to have muscle over mind. Marvel surely didn't pull it off with this one and I hope to see any sequel ideas go down the drain. 1/10",Daredevil
274,sundevil27,Ben Affleck is surprisingly a very good Daredevil but Colin steals the show,8,18 January 2004,"This comic book to screen adaption is not quite as flawless as Spider-Man or the X-men movies, but its still very good and gets better with additional viewing. I saw this in the theatres and left feeling a bit disappointed with the story and wishing for more Bullseye (Colin Farrell). About a year went by and I purchased the DVD, well since that time I started reading the comics and had a much better understanding of the Daredevil character. I find now that I watch this movie more then any of the other comic book movies I own, I find that the movie moves quickly and provides me a fast entertaining movie experience that is good for multiple home viewings when your just looking to waste some time. I thought Ben Affleck proved to be a great Daredevil and Colin Farrell was SO AWESOME as Bullseye, just classic stuff. Now on the other hand Jennifer Garner as Elektra was awful, I just hated her acting and she didnt really seem like the great character that is in the comics. I really wish Jenna Gershon or someone that had more edge was playing the character, in truth Elektra is a trained assassin who just feels very dangerous and I didnt feel in awe of Jennifer. Michael Duncan was the perfect Kingpin and didnt really have much acting to do, but he was very entertaining when he got the chance.

Her legs did look good though.The fight scenes look so blatantly choreographed it almost seemed like there was a momentary pause in each punch, kick, or block so a cool pose could be struck.Do you know how hard you would have to throw a paper clip to penetrate the blubbery jowels of bar bum to kill him? Like really, really, super-duper, hypersonic hard. Not like cool Hollywood wrist-flipping Colon Farewell's girly moves.And what is up with the dialogue? They could have at least tried. And why was the by-day-lawyer such an impotent character?So here's the deal, if you get biohazard waste sprayed in your eyes, you somehow get this sonar thing as a trade off.

I didn't know if it was considered fabulous or trashy, tremendously entertaining or downright boring. I found it to be somewhere in between.All of the actors and performers did an excellent job with the roles and the stunts offered to them. I put the blame for mediocrity solely on the shoulders of writer/director Mark Steven Johnson. Don't get me wrong; the film looks fantastic. The costumes, sets, and lighting all work to great effect, and I was definitely impressed. The look was the most enjoyable part of the movie, because the story was just...there. Johnson took all the ideas from the comic book and put them on the screen, but they don't take on a life of their own. He makes it corny, and silly, because it takes itself so seriously. You can't have a comic book movie take itself seriously yet play it so over the top. One way or the other would work, but not both. This combination gives you a snarling Colin Farrell with almost nothing to do. In his first scene he shows off his skill in a bar, then he's on a plane to New York, then he disappears for the next twenty minutes of screen time.Often throughout the picture, actors are replaced with animation. This would be fine if it weren't so obvious. I don't mean obvious because it looks animated, I mean obvious because the animation is used the way one would make a cartoon, not a theatrical feature. It's one thing to show physical feats in movies that are slightly beyond possibility; that's what movies are for. But every five minutes, a computer generated DareDevil is leaping from one building to another all the way across the street, or falling thirty stories to land on suspended platforms, or any number of impossible feats. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief only so far, and this movie asked me to go to ridiculous lengths. I might have put up with it had it not been so serious the rest of the time. You can't have both.There is too much obvious wire-work, too much pointless cgi, and too much movie-speak to make this movie as good as its look. Some of the effects were eerie, beautiful, and intriguing, while others were simply laughable. I also have a problem with ""see what cool stuff a blind guy can do"" kind of bits in movies with blind characters, and this movie is full of them. Overlooking all the superhero superpowers, there are still a number of things that are just too cute, and every movie with blind people does this, showing how they can hear stuff or smell things that us sighted folk never pay attention to. It's not like that. The movie is entertaining in a purely comic book fashion, and I agree with another user comment I read on here: if you don't go in expecting much, you'll be satisfied.",Daredevil

I am not the intellectual snob many film critics seem to be regarding the genre. But this was a lifeless, plotless, seen it before but better, mess.  The dialogue and acting was as embarrassing as the self indulgent, OTT direction.  This is how NOT to adapt a comic book.  Yes comic books have a certain dialogue and are by nature OTT, but that is what they are as an art form onto themselves.  Just as a novel is a novel.  In transition to the screen things need to change - costumes, dialogue, presentation.  Hence the word 'adaptation'.  Batman, X-Men and Spiderman got it right, and I have the utmost fate in Ang Lee to deliver this summer for 'Hulk'.

278,sbrobin,It pained me to watch this garbage - Spoilers,1,21 February 2004,"Maybe not the worst ever, but definitely close. How they could have such a huge budget for this film and accept such a horrible story is beyond me.I've been a pretty big comic book fan for 20 years. While I never got into Daredevil too much, he made numerous guest appearances in my favorite comics, and I was looking forward to this film. Yes, it's a comic book movie, but the level of camp in this film was unreal. There must have been hundreds of cheesy lines in almost every line of dialog during this film, you'd almost think Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote the screenplay. Add to that the ridiculous amount of blind jokes and it was painful to sit through. Okay, Daredevil is blind, and yet has insanely high perception in his other senses, we get it. No need to show endless shots of him doing amazing things with his other senses to hammer this into our skulls. Bullseye has perfect aim and can hit anything he wants to, we get it, no need to show 20 scenes of him using this skill either.This film takes ""ridiculousness"" to a new level. Daredevil is human. Unlike Spider-Man, he has no genetic mutations. He simply has heightened senses from being blind. The story never proclaims he has anything other than human abilities either. However, there are literally hundreds of stunts that Daredevil does that are humanly impossible, I don't care how great he can here, there is no way he can jump 50 feet in the air, or vault off a 50 story building and land on a fire escape and not break his legs. This guy could give Spider-Man a run for his money for all the advantages they gave him.By letting Daredevil achieve insane stunts, it creates no sense of weakness for him. You are never left feeling like there is a battle this guy can't win, which is a mistake in film making. Daredevil can scale a 20 foot wall, yet he gets stabbed in the shoulder and that knocks him out for half the film? He can't summon the energy to help out Elektra, his love, yet right after that he can make his way a couple miles across town and get involved in the fight of his life?! This film is FILLED with inconsistencies, mistakes, and just absurd events that would require a complete suspension of belief reality in order to enjoy this film. I expect comic book movies to take some license, but this film makes ""Armageddon"" look like it was taken straight from the film vaults at NASA. And with all of this absurdity, there is no way to enjoy this film as a campy popcorn movie. I would consider ""Tomb-Raider"" a masterpiece in comparison.Perhaps the biggest flaw with this film is the CGI. For a recent movie, this is some of the worst CGI effects I have ever seen. None of it looked realistic. I can't think of a single special effect that I would believe. Remember that scene in Spider Man where Toby Maguire gets his new powers and starts jumping 50 feet in the air from roof to roof? Imagine an entire movie of that. They may as well have left the blue screens and wires in. At least Mark Steven Johnson admits on his commentary that the CGI is crap.Did I mention that Bullseye (with a horrible performance by Colin Farrell) actually cuts someone's throat with a playing card in this film and kills a man by throwing a paper-clip into his neck?!That being said, if you like this film, the DVD is loaded with bonus features. The audio and video come across very well, and the featurettes are fairly well done. This DVD has everything you could want if you're a fan of the film.",Daredevil
279,saprater,Please let there NOT be a sequel,2,2 August 2003,"By far the worst comic book adaptation to date.  1. The story went by WAY too fast and with too many gaps in between.  It was like they spent so much time trying to get the film made in a hurry and most of their budget on the fight scenes, that they had nothing left to show the audience.  2.  I love Ben, but not in this movie.  He just doesn't cut it as a superhero anymore than Matt Damon did in the Bourne Identity.  Better for them to stick with dramatic roles I think.  Add to that the fact that Ben had more on-screen chemistry with his character's legal partner than Elektra.3.  The fight scenes.  Oh God...they were so laughable.  A cheaply made cross between Crouching Tiger and the Matrix.  Extremely fake looking, and even with movie magic they still couldn't make Matt and Elektra look like they knew how to fight.The only saving grace was Colin Farrell's performance.  He stole the show much as Tom Arnold did in True Lies.  The plane scene (I won't say more for fear of ruining it for the rest of you) had me in stitches. 
Overall I give it a 2 out of 10 and hope that this is the only one they make...since they left room for a sequel at the end.  Although I personally think that this would have made a great t.v. series.",Daredevil

The addition of cut scenes & re-editing made the story flow better. The movie certainly had it's flaws for comic book purists, most troubling to me was the way in which they changed Matt's origin (had him running away after he saw his father beating a guy up) instead of the original where he was hit by a truck while saving an old blind man. I can see that the ""saving a blind guy"" may be consider hokey by today's standards, but turning his father into a thug, instead of a guy who refused to knuckle under to the mobsters and throw a fight seemed really needless.

281,terrancegore,Appalled and Disappointed,1,14 April 2018,"Firstly, a bit of context.I first read a Daredevil comic in the 1970s, when Roger McKenzie and then, Frank Miller were writing the character. My 12 year old self found a lifelong hero.So when I heard about a Daredevil film, back in 2002, I was incredibly excited, hoping that they would do it justice, but those hopes were crushed when I finally saw the film on it's opening weekend.So what was wrong with it. Well, if I could leave my prejudices aside (which I can't and I don't want to, anyway, because they were hard earned), I'd still think this was a terrible film. Badly underwritten characters (from an exceptional Frank Miller story arc), a script filled to the brim with idiotic and non-sensical plot details, poor performances by Garner, Affleck and Farrell, studio interference which led to 27 minutes being hacked from the final cut, poor editing and a director who, for me, didn't really have clear idea of what he wanted to achieve.I left the cinema, not just disappointed, but appalled at what had been done to my childhood hero. And I have not revised that opinion over the years, even with the advent of the ""Director's Cut"". I hoped that this would be some kind of magical rehabilitation for the film, but although it is less clunky and makes a little more sense, the aforementioned issues still persist.So, If you like superheroe fare, this would be one to miss. Watch the TV series (although they allowed DD to become incredibly whiney in series 2) and leave this one be. It has no saving graces and will just irritate and annoy.",Daredevil
282,jaspermcc,"Action OK, Dialogue comically bad (as bad as this pun)",6,17 February 2003,"I seem to come out of every film I see these days wondering who wrote the dialogue. The witty banter between Elektra and Matt Murdock was anything but. It was garbage. The action scenes weren't bad, and Colin Farrell was pretty good as Bullseye (although I was disappointed when he didn't appear in a blue and white spandex outfit after asking Kingpin for one). The overall tone of the film was just ruined by bad dialogue.",Daredevil
283,Munin75,Failure,3,28 May 2012,"I may sound like a total douche-bag, but how any mature adult can think of Daredevil as a good movie is beyond me. Sure, all tastes are out there. In all honesty I'm willing to understand that some specific movies that I didn't particularly think much of are loved by others. The difference is that Daredevil is in a whole different league of bad.The main problem I have with Daredevil is the style. The cheesiness. It's like Ang Lee's Hulk, which coincidently came out the same year in 2003. These two films are to me the heirs of such cheesefests like 1997 Batman & Robin. Daredevil is an example of how not to make a superhero film, while movies like Nolan's Batman series, or Ironman, stand as opposite examples of how to go about this admittedly extremely difficult genre. Actually, I feel the Batman character is much more difficult to render on screen than Daredevil, who is more naturally cool (because less eccentric but still naturally ""dark""), so kudos to Nolan and Burton for their achievements.Another criticism for Daredevil is that it drags on too much. It takes 40 minutes into the film for Matt Murdock/Daredevil to meet Elektra, which is arguably the moment when the movie actually starts and stops feeling like an origin-story flashback. I'm not against long character development, but Daredevil's first 40 minutes of nothingness were not compelling to me. They were enough to draw my attention, not my interest.And when the movie actually starts, 40 minutes in, Matt Murdock/Daredevil flirts with Elektra by fighting her, which is probably one of the most ridiculous moments in modern cinema. Only after that are we truly introduced to the bad guys and the cheesiness of the film skyrockets. I actually had cramps in my eye sockets for rolling my eyes so much.Anyway, Daredevil belongs in the temple of failed superhero movies, with Batman & Robin, Ang Lee's Hulk, The Fantastic Four, and of course Daredevil's spin-off Elektra.",Daredevil
284,allfunandgames,Daredevil - My review,5,2 April 2003,"Seeing as Daredevil is the latest in a recent, and growing, string of comic-based movies, it is only fair that it is judged and compared with its peers.Daredevil certainly features more action than both X-Men and Spiderman, as it moves from setpiece to setpiece, often with shallow story points to link them together. The action is fast and frenetic, but often obscured by the darkness, which also serves to attempt to disguise the constant stream of special effects. Director Mark Steven Johnson has previously helmed the sap 'Simon Birch' and this 'talent' is obvious during the love scenes here. Too often do they seem contrived and rushed, with Murdock being reduced to someone who has sex on the first date (no offence).But Daredevil is not all bad. The casting of Duncan as head honcho Kingpin is a stroke of genius and Farrell has the time of his life as the wild Bullseye. As for Garner, she is the eye candy, as well as being a real physical talent in the martial arts department. As Murdock, Affleck is only serviceable, while his stuntmen have their work cut out for them throughout. The rest of the supporting cast play their parts well, with Favreau a constant riot and Kevin Smith in a choice cameo.As a whole, Daredevil occasionally entertains as a pop-corn flick, but fails to reach the lofty heights set by both X-Men and Spiderman.Worst bit: The cliché 'open fire' love scene (which singlehandedly lowered my grade a whole point).4/10",Daredevil
285,DarkLugia1969,The Man Without Fear,7,14 February 2003,"The Man Without Fear finally strikes the hearts of viewers on this fine Valentine Day. As you well know if your a avid comic fan, Daredevil was created in 1964 by Stan Lee and Bill Everett. The story is based on the life of the hero named Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck, ""Dogma"") who is accidently struck blind by radioactive waste causing young Matt to obtain ""radar senses"". The young Murdock then learns and develops martial art skills to become a masked vigilante dubbed by one of the reporters, ""the Daredevil"".
The movie is based on the storyline from one of the greatest Daredevil comics ever (Daredevil volume 1, 181) and it involves Matt's love interest Electra (Jennifer Garner, ""Alias"") as well as Ol' Hornhead's mortal enemies of the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, ""The Green Mile"") and the crazed assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrell, ""Minority Report""). Like most comic based movies you get lots of action and special effects which includes how Daredevil uses his radar senses and the way it is shown on the screen. Finally, this movie does as his slow moments but eventually starts right up again towards the climatic battle between Mr. Affleck and Mr. Duncan. If Marvel does well in this movie (and they should) then they will have a bountiful year with two other Marvel Comics based movies (""X-men 2"" and ""The Hulk"", ""my boy"").My rating as the Dark Gengar in this Marvel hit from 1 to 10: 7.5 (Expect a possible sequel) Aloha.",Daredevil
286,sdillon-1,Surprisingly good.,7,30 July 2003,"Dare Devil was a complete surprise to me.  I was expecting little and I got a lot.  In fairness, it's nothing spectacularly new.  Tim Burton's Batman films covered similar ground a decade ago, but Dare Devil has been unfairly roasted by critics and deserves better recognition.  It has good fights and stunts, plus some colourful villains (especially the delightfully vicious Bullseye).  The plot works in the usual childhood trauma nonsense to good effect, and there is a nice ambiguity to the way Dare Devil administers so-called justice as he tries to reassure himself `I'm not the bad guy.' Better still is the moral centre of the film, personified by the Catholic priest Dare Devil befriends, who encourages him to leave vengeance to God. There are some nice twists and turns in the tale too, as well as the obligatory sequel set-up.The film was well directed, especially where the audience sees the sound wave vibrations the hero's POV.  Performances were all fairly solid, and the special effects quite good despite one or two dodgy shots.  I had a few nits to pick, such as the tedious and unnecessary sex scene with Jennifer Gardner (less annoying here than I usually find her).  However, on the whole this is another fine addition to the recent ranks of good comic book adaptations, along with Spider-Man and X-Men.",Daredevil
287,a_digiacomo,Comic Book Capers,5,12 April 2005,"As a 43 yr old man who grew up on first generation Marvel comics, I went into Daredevil wanting a good experience. OK, as has been written here before, the Director's Cut is a better version in those commentator's opinions, BUT in mine, someone who read a little of the original comic book version (I'll admit I was more a Fantastic Four, Iron Man, early Spider-Man fan), I can say I was disappointed with the choice of actors in this film. What the heck is so hot/special/talented about Ms. Garner? Oh Uh Okay, she acts in a ridiculous wildly un common sense, nonsense TV show, but why is she the darling of geek boys everywhere? She isn't even good eye candy IMHO! And I'm really tired of Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, etc.--why are they thrown at us as the new ""Uber Stars"" who can do ""every genre of film plot/story""? IMHO they don't do anything but look attractive(as my girlfriend always dreamily sighs) I don't get the Hollywood ""this is the formula-break from it and die"" attitude forced on film makers these days(and I spent 15yrs writing for the studios and TV networks as a free lance writer doing ""script polishes/re-writes"" etc.) So I know the bullying! BUT this said, why make a sub standard version of a third rate comic book character and sell it to the geek boys who you know, are out to fine tooth comb EVERY miss step and wrong written iota? Too many ""flash bang snazzy"" MTV filming techniques, too much reliance on CGI, not nearly enough attention to PLOT and STORY and CHARACTERIZATION!Movies these days seem to be made for single and double digit IQ, MTV/VH1 addicted micro attention span, illiterate pod people pretending to be sentient beings(and for all my bitterness and misanthropy--I'm a college professor who TEACHES screen writing and play writing, as well as how to write science fiction, fantasy and heroic (pulp as well as super)--I feel like a dinosaur that hasn't noticed I'm extinct!) All this flick had going for it IMHO, is the FANTASTIC ULTRA COOL, TOTALLY BELIEVABLE AS SUPERVILLAIN, Colin Firth as BullsEye--the classic response to Kingpin's question of what he can pay BullsEye: ""I want a cool costume like he has""(or words to that effect I may be paraphrasing!)",Daredevil
288,dcreed,Best Marvel adaptation yet,8,8 August 2003,"I think this is one of the best comic book adaptations yet.  The acting was good (a helluva lot better than Dunst and Maguire in SpiderMan), the action was good (better than X-Men or SpiderMan). Good cinematography, dialog....  Good film.  Glad I saw it and glad I bought it.  Although I wish the DVD had deleted scenes.  There are a ton of 'em alluded to in the other extras, so it'd be interesting to see those.",Daredevil
289,dcreed,Better than SpiderMan by a long shot,8,23 September 2003,"It's a shame this didn't do better because this is a lot better than SpiderMan was, although that one got all the hype.  Affleck can act better than Maguire, and a potted plant can act better than Dunst.  Jennifer Garner can act a helluva lot better than a potted plant.This also had a lot fewer plot holes than SpiderMan.  However, I guess people like what's unoriginal and comfortable, and SpiderMan was all of that.  Daredevil, for my money, had better action, better acting, and a better story.",Daredevil
290,Treeman222,Not Bad At All,7,16 February 2003,"I'll start off by saying this: ""Superman"" is still the best superhero movie made so far, and I thought ""Spider Man"" and ""X-Men"" were both good, but not great.With that in mind, I liked Daredevil overall. I thought the effects were good, the story fairly compelling and the acting solid. It was straight faced and (mostly) realistic. The opening scene in a church sets a great tone for the film, and I loved that fact that he pulls a tooth out of his mouth after a fight.What I didn't like was that many of the fight scenes were confusing and dark, especially the first one. They do get better, though, and their are some genuinely cool scenes.Also, I thought ""Bullseye"" was a bit too much. Colin Ferrel was good, but some of the things he did were needlessly overdone. The scene during the closing credits is especially stupid.Overall, though, a pretty good addition to the new wave of superhero movies. It's darker and less mainstream than last summer's ""Spider Man"", but then so are the comics. 7 out of 10.",Daredevil

292,driffma,What a fun film,8,16 February 2003,"Movie Review: Daredevil By MaxDThere has been a great deal of doubt and second-guessing where the movie Daredevil is concerned. 'Ben Affleck as Daredevil?' People were incredulous to be sure. There were doubts about Michel Clarke Duncan playing the large and dangerous Kingpin. I am not sure why exactly. Affleck is a capable actor, as is Duncan, and they do fine here. For those of you who do not know the story of Daredevil the following details might be important. Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdock, a man blinded by toxic waste as a child. The accident, while robbing him of sight enhanced his remaining senses, touch, smell, hearing, taste and gave him a kind of radar sense. I will not dwell on the details that lead him to become a superhero, see the movie for the back-story. By day Matt Murdock is a lawyer, and by night he is the superhero known as Daredevil. The approach the movie takes to this second tier Marvel comic book character is an interesting one. Daredevil is essentially a normal human being, perhaps a bit too agile, and maybe to strong, but leaving that aside, he is not superhuman. His medicine cabinet is full of painkillers of various potencies and we see him chew on percosets as if they were candy, as he stares blindly into a mirror. He feels pain and seems to live with it. Lots of it. It is a sad thing to see. A comic book movie needs more than just a super-hero, it needs colorful supporting characters, a love interest, and a super-villains. Maybe two super-villains. This movie has all of that. Murdock quickly meets the girl of his dreams, a dangerous woman named Elektra Natchios, played by Jennifer Garner. He has plucky sidekick lawyer friend Franklin 'Foggy' Nelson (John Farvereau), and is befriended by the witty newspaper man Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano). Michael Clarke Duncan is an incredible presence as Kingpin/Wilson Fisk. He exudes genuine menace in every scene, whether he is entertaining guests or taking care of his 'business.' He is calm, cold and ruthless. He looks just like a man who could kill you with one punch. That is not a bad attribute to have if you are the sole boss of New York's extensive underground. His chief enforcer is Bullseye, played by Colin Farrell as a highly-strung psychopath with a peculiar talent. Bullseye, as you might guess given the name, can throw anything with deadly almost un-erring accuracy. They are all a lot of fun to watch.How does this film stack up to other comic book films? It is no Spider-man, arguably the greatest comic book film ever made. But it is a solid film. It isn't afraid to dwell on the characters, to let them talk, no one over acts and it is also quite witty. I would say that it is closer to X-Men, or the Blade movies as comic book films go. I do a 1-10 scale, and this gets and 8, solid but not quite great. Well as Stan Lee used to say, and maybe still does, Excelsior!",Daredevil
293,joshreeves01,Much better than expected,10,14 February 2003,This is not an oscar contender but this is a very fun time at the movies. I am not one of these people that hate Affleck but i wasn't sure about him in the role but he pulled it off and was fantastic. The rest of the cast was great and the action was very good(little to much cgi at times but still very good. I would reccomend to anybody who is just looking for a good times at the movies.,Daredevil
294,joshreeves01,great dark adventure film,10,19 February 2003,This film was really good for people who like the dark comic films like the first 2 batman movies. It did have some flaws and the first fight was cut to quickly but other than that everything was great. Ben affleck did a very good job and jennifer garner was to hot to describe. Overall a fun times at the movie for action adventure fans.,Daredevil
295,Stoli_Raz_N_7,Director's Cut definitely worth a look,7,22 March 2005,"Especially if you've already seen the theatrical release, the director's cut adds so much more to the story and the other character's of the film, and even fills in some of the holes in the plot of the original version (holes which, by the way, were big enough to drive a Hummer through them.) While a few well-liked scenes were taken out to make room for over 35 additional minutes of original footage - scenes such as the love-making clip with Affleck and Garner - trust me when I say that those missing or re-edited bits actually help the story to make more sense.And while those who aren't fans of the Daredevil comic or theatrical release probably won't care if the story makes more sense (which is all too unfortunate for them,) the fans will appreciate it.Now, while I'm not saying the director's cut should replace the original version, I am saying that I certainly enjoyed it. Hell, I own it. And I can say without a doubt that I like the director's cut more than the original.As with any of the other comments that I've written for other films, I know I haven't revealed much about the film itself. That's because I am a big believer in the notion that you should see a film for yourself, and form your own opinion. Except for ""Torque"". Nobody should see that film - unless it's being used as a torture device.",Daredevil
296,dmkay,Devoid of original thought,2,14 February 2003,"A truly awful movie. Every cliche you would expect is here twofold, the computer effects are obvious and constant (they even use CGI for a rat at the beginning where they could easily have used a live rat), the plot is 100% predictable, the sets are just boring alleys and rooftops that look lifted directly from the outtakes of Spider-Man, and the dialogue gets many an unintended laugh. The only worthwhile thing about this movie was the trailer for X-Men 2 that preceded it.",Daredevil
297,ShazaliSharaini,I refuse to accept this as an adaptation!,4,19 August 2003,"There're gonna be spoilers here, so...Now, I really hope the sequel is gonna show us how little Matt gain his superskills. I refuse to buy he self-trained himself.I hope the sequel is more of a year one movie. Kinda like spiderman.And Matt Murdock is a show-off? Come on! How many blind people in the world shows off he/she could smell a beautiful woman from a distance in a crowded place? And try to pick up a girl by fighting her? Jumping around and balancing on a see saw? In a public place?And Elektra. Where's the mystery which surrounds her? And she talks a lot, too. No, No, NO!!Now, why do all villains have to be the one involved in murdering the hero's father/mother? Like Joker-Batman?Like Catwoman, Elektra's not really dead even though her heart had stopped beating.The only thing I like about this movie is- that's right- Bullseye.This Daredevil movie is a Batman/Batman Returns ripoff.OK. It's time to have a different director and change the whole thing. No, not Joel Schumacher.Don't ask how many stars I would give for this crap. I'm glad I didn't watch it in the theatre.",Daredevil
298,wtbe7560,Ugh...why does Ben Affleck suck so bad??,3,8 December 2005,"I suffered through Daredevil last night, and I can say...it sucks. BAD. I am told the Director's Cut is better, but let's be frank...it would be hard to do much worse. Affleck is a terrible choice for Matt Murdock. He spends half the time on camera mugging like it's a photo shoot. He can't ever seem to get the eyes right...sometimes one is crossed, sometimes both...he acts like he's taking a driver's license photo.The plot is razor thin. Michael Clarke Duncan makes a great Kingpin, the only good part about this movie. What plot there is centers around Murdock, who as a kid is blinded by toxic waste and finds his other senses are enhanced. Of course he turns to fighting crime and falls in love with the daughter of a gangster. Ugh. The action scenes are badly CGI'd, the plot is laughable, and the acting is 3rd rate. This movie will make you want to gouge out your eyes to prevent them from ever seeing this crap again.",Daredevil
299,plotlessviolence,ugh....adaptations,5,3 August 2006,"Not that I didn't enjoy the movie, but come on: with adaptations, the Director KNOWS the idea didn't get greenlit on the screenwriter's talent, but on fan demand for a character. Mark Steven Johnson didn't get Daredevil: the movie made, Frank Miller did, way back in the 1980s. So why is it they all insist on making pointless changes to the story? Some people say ""oh, who cares about rabies fans and Canon as long as they make the movie better?"" but they NEVER never make changes that improve the script, it's only changes that rile the character's fans. And why? Because the writer's ego demands it, and the studio knows true fans will see the movie no matter how much they hate it.In descending order of importance: 1) Daredevil does not kill. (Neither does Batman, of course, but in both their first theatrical outings they kill their main nemesises). This fact allows for some of the better Daredevil comics, where he battles The Punisher to keep him from killing criminals.2) Matt Murdock met Elektra in college, years before he took the Daredevil mantle. Elektra's father (a diplomat, not mobster) and she were taken hostage, Murdock wore a scarf--his first mask--and intervened, which accidentally led to Elektra's father's death. Neither Kingpin nor Bullzeye is involved in any of these events.3) Daredevil got his powers by pushing an old man out of the way of a truck carrying toxic barrels. Where was the old man in the scene? Would it have been that hard to include him? 4) No priest ever knows of Daredevil's identity. One nun knows, his mother, but the list of people who know Matt Murdock's secret identity is much shorter than with most superheroes.5) Elektra Natchios' hair is black, not brown. Hundreds of dollars of Hollywood-quality makeup spent per day, and no one brought a bottle of hair dye? She'll wear colored contacts, which involves shoving small plastic things in you eye, but not hair dye? 6)The fixer who tried to get Jack Murdock to throw the fight is named ""The Fixer,"" not ""Fallon,"" and the Fixer was Murdock's manager right up until the night of the fight. Also, no prior origin story ever claimed that Kingpin was involved until now.7) Kingpin is white. And he doesn't sign his murders with roses.8) ""Battlin'"" Jack Murdock's hooded costume is yellow, not red, and it's what gets made into Daredevil's initial costume.9) Bullzeye wears a costume. One of the comic book versions of him has that bullzeye mutilation in his forehead, so that's tolerable, but if you're going to kill of his comic book archnemesis, at least let him go out properly.10) Ben Urich was never bald.11) Daredevil was trained by Stick. Granted, the movie doesn't totally establish he wasn't, but given Daredevil is one of the few superhero characters who earned his powers through martial arts training (unlike, say, being born a mutant or with Kryptonian blood), the idea that everything he has was granted by the silver plattered-toxic waste tasted wrong.That said, it's not that great of a movie but I liked it anyway. I do that. Fight scenes aren't bad, the acrobatics reflect Daredevil's style properly, the central thesis of determination triumphing is still present, and I liked the fact that all the minor characters were named after the comic book writers and illustrators.",Daredevil
300,tzmalone,Refreshingly true to its source material (as best as I can remember...),7,18 February 2003,"It was the Frank Miller Daredevil which kicked off my appreciation of this character and his additions to the legend (turning Spiderman foe, The Kingpin, into DD's central nemesis, Electra, Ben Urich - who also probably came out of Spidey, Stick - who doesn't appear but may figure in the Electra spin-off, and, most likely, it was Miller who layered in the Hell's Kitchen/Catholic Church angles).  Director/Writer Mark Steven Johnson did a great job of translating that DD onto the screen.  Turning Daredevil's radar sense into a sonar sense was wonderfully inventive.  I think I liked Spiderman the movie better than this one but I think it's the difference between the visual energy of the two movies, like comparing Superman the Movie to Batman the Movie (the first in each franchise).  I give Superman/Superman the edge because, well, it's more cinematic to watch a character actively do super-human things rather than do things via a more passive gimmick (Bat-equipment or sonar sense).  And part of DD's problem is that it suffers a bit from ""Batman III/IV-itis"" from the beginning.  At least, the first Batman contented itself with a thumbnail origin story. DD does a more full-blown origin backstory plus introduces three pivotal characters (4 or 5 if you count Urich and the priest).  All these characters get underwritten which wouldn't be bad if key characters got more screen time to establish them.  The Kingpin, for instance, is, arguably, the most nuanced villian in the Marvel Universe (after Doctor Doom).  What we get in DD is an big, brutal black man not a Godfather-esque figure tortured by the illness of his beloved wife who built a criminal empire as powerful and dominant as his brawn.  What we get is Electra, who we are told has been studying martial arts since she was five, but not Electra Assassin, perhaps the most dangerous killer for hire in the world - discounting, of course, Bullseye.",Daredevil

Very entertaining stuff, probably needed more focus on the plot and the villains, would make the film feel less short. Shame that there was never a sequel. Possibly more build up to the plot, the background story for Daredevil happened too quick.Colin Farrell was actually good in this as Bullseye, he definitely needed more screen time. Otherwise, good superhero action with interesting characters and doesn't get boring.Ben Affleck did a good job as Daredevil, it's a shame that there was no sequel because his character seems likable.",Daredevil
302,knightsend2k1,"Some things right,some things wrong,still enjoyable.",10,10 January 2004,"Let's talk about what went right.I really didnt expect Affleck to be any good.I was wrong..He did a pretty good imitation of Daredevil as well as Matthew Murdock.I especially liked how he apparently took the time to present Daredevil's attitude as constantly evolving.Murdock has always been a character shown in the comics as a man who adapts to any situation.Nicely done here.It was also nice to show he was willing to take his lumps.Loved the sleep deprivation tank too.Love the Daredevil costume,the presentation of his Radar Sense,the fight scenes,and the music.I really loved how Bullseye was presented.A complete maniac.Loved it to pieces.Hated the costume change though.Is it me or didnt he end up looking like a deranged George Michael ?? Here is what I had a MAJOR problems with : # 1 - Why was Kingpin changed from a massive white Sumo type to a black Hip Hop thug ?!?! Is this The Kingpin or a bad Biggie Smalls imitator ?? Michael Clark Duncan as The Kingpin ? What the hell were you smoking people ??!! What's next, a white Black Panther ? Leave the characters exactly the way they were MEANT to be.# 2 - Jennifer Garner was a good choice to play Elektra,so why dress her up in black leather ? They should have let her wear the traditional red outfit found in the comics.Is there some fetish in hollywood with leather in comic movies these days or what ? # 3 - Bullseye's scar....you have GOT to be kidding me.Now if they would have shown him actually put the scar there in the movie to showcase his dementia MAYBE that would have worked...but they didnt.It looked ridiculous. and finally # 4 - Where was the courtroom drama we were promised ? Let me get this straight,here we have a movie about a superhero lawyer....and he's barely seen in the courtroom ??? Go figure.Ah, well.What's done is done.It could have been worse,and it could have been better.It's enjoyable,heck I bought the DVD....but I still cant imagine Duncan as The Kingpin.Some thug,yeah,but the Kingpin ?

A really fantastic actress who will hopefully find herself in better films than this. My main problem with this film is the casting of Ben Affleck. He adds nothing to this film. His performance is the same . I think Russell Crowe might have been better cast in this or Guy Pierce or even one of Jennifer's co-stars on Alias ( Michael Vartan or Bradley Cooper).It is almost like the supporting players are the ones carrying the film. Colin Ferral was excellent as well as the actor who plays King Pin. However, why do movies like this always show NYC as a dark dank and evil place. It is not.",Daredevil

He could have had 3-5 minutes in the flashback sequence.  Also the costume was almost laughable.  Daredevil with a collar??

306,sackleywhistle,About as faithful an adaptation as you're gonna get...,8,28 July 2003,"In the wake of the glut of comic book movies, Daredevil is up there with the best of them. The problem is, for most he is either a complete unknown or a poor-man's Spiderman. Never fear, the movie gives you a crash course in Daredevil, setting up the character perfectly and playing out an actual story form the comics, involving the four characters that made Daredevil what it is - DD himself, arch-rival Kingpin, super-efficient assassin Bullseye and tragic sexpot Elektra.There has been a lot made of the casting being off in this film, which i feel is unfair. In recent years, Ben affleck has done sterling work in this, Sum of All Fears and especially Changing Lanes. He IS DD, he looks exactly like Frank Miller's version in the comics and has a lot of great moments as both Matt Murdock and the man without fear. Jennifer Garner as Elektra is sexy, tough and a perfect foil to Ben's DD, the greatest departure being her outfit. Many have said that Micheal Clarke Duncan as Kingpin is ludicrous, as Kingpin was white - rubbish! I can think of noone better to fill out the Kingpin's considerable frame, white or black. When an actor's physicality, presence and voice so suit the character, who cares what colour he is?! The only false step really is Bullseye as played by Colin Farrell, who resembles the comic character only in style, but he's so damn charming and deadly at the same time that you forgive the decision straight off.The writing, acting and style of the film are exactly as Daredevil should be done - DD's radar sense in manifest beautifully, particularly in the early scenes when he is a scared child and in his scenes with Elektra (the sound of rain is a particular highlight). Of the action scenes there is really only one duff sequence, the confusing and slightly sluggish redneck bar fight. The others are not only exciting and efficiently shot, but are almost straight out of the comic. DD's battles with Bullseye can be disorientating but they ARE the comic.This is a film made by a rabid DD fan and starring a DD fan (Affleck) which should delight DD fans and attract newcomers to a little-known alladin's cave of delights. Watch out for DD popping pills and sleeping in an isolation tank to cope with the pain of being an ordinary guy with a gift he uses for good - yet is labelled a bad guy. There's even a genuinely touching romance, a touch of tragedy and a nice sentiment which isn't hammered home wihtout subtlety.An underappreciated, if not epic, joy for comic fans and those who don't follow the pack. And the (region 2, at least) DVD has a brilliant, in-depth look at the comics, with a great section by comics legend Frank Miller. Check it out, you won't regret it. Its not as all-round brilliant as X2, but its more faithful and satisfying than the slightly bloated Hulk (which i still have a lot of love for).Sackley",Daredevil
307,EvilLost,SIMPLY TERRIBLE!,3,18 February 2003,"Having seen Spider-man (and loving it!) I decided to go out and see Daredevil. When the opening credits began I had high hopes, especially since they were in the same ""style"" as spider-man I had high hopes for this movie....But then, it began. There is a few short minutes about how he got his power, then all of a sudden you have Daredevil with no explanation of his suit and high tech ""stuff"". The fight scenes had *NO* realism whatsoever and his love interest is introduced so suddenly there is absolutely no character buildup. Then again, non of the characters are really built up, the bad guys dont have much of an ""evil"" vibe to them, and there is absolutely no reason to feel bad when a person is kiled...Flat out, this movie sucks. Go watch spider-man again.",Daredevil
308,starlasunlight,I actually liked it!!!!,8,14 January 2005,"I genuinely liked this film. I love love Colin Farrell but he annoyed me in Daredevil. This movie was believable and not all soppy. Jennifer Garner is as always very good.I'm becoming a huge fan of hers.As someone mentioned I was touched when Matts friend said he wanted to loan him his eyes to see Elektra in her dress. It was quite a darker comic book movie compared to Spiderman. I think its there with the good superhero films like Hellboy and Punisher.Ben Affleck is good and I don't know why some don't like him. He looks good, can act and has good on screen chemistry with Jennifer Garner. I'm going to buy the Directors Cut tomorrow. Loved it!",Daredevil
309,jsc173,"I Really Wanted To Like It, But .....",5,24 February 2003,"I'm a fan of Affleck and Garner, not to mention Michael Clark-Duncan and Joe Pantoliano. But, other than the ""wow"" of some of the special effects (which weren't so special after they were repeated and repeated), I felt like almost everyone onscreen could've phoned in their perfomances.
Sorry, I can't recommend this movie. Even my kids (10 and 12) thought it was just ""OK"".",Daredevil
310,*(CableGuy)*,A refreshingly non-hubris superhero film,8,14 February 2003,"Daredevil is far from perfect, but it was surprisingly good.  Ben Affleck portrays Matt Murdock as both pained and cocky, a man who is good at what he does, and knows it, but also knows that isn't always enough.  It's a nice turn from the typical milquetoast hero with a heart of gold and token flaws. Clark Kent, he ain't.  I love how the film skips skips his early heroic adventures, simply jumping from his childhood to a Daredevil who has been in the game for a few years.  Spiderman, as good as it was, did take quite a while for the real action to begin.  Daredevil also distunguishes itself with subtler set pieces.  There are no ridiculous criminal hideouts or rooftop-to-rooftop chases.  The ending is fairly satisfying, if it betrays Daredevil's motivations a bit.The fight scenes were fairly well-done, for being shot in a close-up, fast-cut manner.  DD's fight with Bulleye in the church is a little heavy on the CG actors, but then that's a running trend in comic book movies. Fights like Murdock's play-duel with Elektra have just the right mix of Hong Kong style and comic-book charm.  After all, at its base, you've got a blind man exacting vengeance in red bondage gear, you can't have total realism. Special kudos to the portrayal of DD's sonar vision.  It's truly inventive, and not just there for flash value.For the comic geeks out there, there are quite a number of in-jokes, almost overwhelmingly so.  Stan the Man is fairly prominent, but he's far from the only reference.  Pay attention to the man with a pencil in his forehead. His appearance is a nice stamp of approval.  The name actors are all pretty solid.  Ben Affleck almost makes up for some of his transgressions like ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Forces of Nature,"" reminding us that he can act, and well if he wants to.  Colin Farrell is lauded in every review I read of this film, and rightfully so.  I'm glad they let him speak in his own accent. Jennifer Garner plays the type of girl who'll beat you silly- and you'll like it.  Jon Favreau adds humor without being a total moron as Foggy, and Michael Clarke Duncan is pretty much as good a non-CG Kingpin as you'll ever find.As for my personal issues with the movie, I only have a couple.  First of all, CG roses suck.  A real shot of a real rose, however more random and inflexible, would have been nicer.  Also, the love scene was a bit painful. I mean, it ended with the shot tracking to a fireplace!  I'm not expecting a steamed-up screen in a Marvel movie, but don't cloy us like that.But whining aside, I'm very pleased with Daredevil.  The film remains plausible enough while retaining enough of a comic book feel to respect its source.  It's got name actors, geek references, good action, a decent romance- something for everyone.  Now where's DC Comics with something half this good?",Daredevil
311,Michael Laing,A good adaptation,8,7 March 2003,"Well,  I must admit that Daredevil isn't one of me faverate Marvel Charactors but neither was Blade and that was a classic.  For me it was a very good attempt at a film, far better than Spiderman in almost every way. It kept to the Daredevil history quite well, The CGI rarely got over the top and the acting was good.",Daredevil
312,Artist_TRS,A Blind Hero in a Tone-Deaf Movie,4,12 March 2020,"""Daredevil"" of 2003 is a tonally inconsistent mess and it's really disappointing and frustrating because as an avid fan and reader of the source comics, Daredevil is one of my favourite superheroes.The movie's tonal depiction of Matt Murdock's origin and tragic evolution into Daredevil is grimly superb and stirs the audience with empathy. Equally grim in tone too, early in the movie also, blind lawyer Murdock strives for justice of a wrongfully victorious criminal in the courtroom and dons the persona of Daredevil to procure it. After a brutal tavern brawl, culminating in the criminal being severed in half by an oncoming subway train, the progressive grim content early shown of 2003's ""Daredevil"" makes you expect a runtime of much the same, but stupidly, that's not the case...Soon after you'll witness a puerile, cringe inducing scuffle between Matt Murdoch and Electra set in a park with senseless stunts upon a seesaw with children bystanders. Then later witness a puerile, cringe inducing portrayal of Bullseye that's near insulting satire to the source comics. Even the movie's soundtrack seemingly bounces around arbitrarily of genres from grunge-rock to rap. What happened? The movie tonally derails; it doesn't know what it wants to be and who it wants to appeal to.There's sufficient grim and gloomy tone to the narrative, but I wish ""Daredevil"" of 2003 was consistent with that storytelling sensibility; it would've been far superior than it is. The jarring tonal shifts cripple it for me... like a reverse double kick to Kingpin's knees.",Daredevil
313,peterinvt,Overlong first act leaves little time for rest of movie.,1,20 February 2003,"This is similar to the first batman in that it is a film noir adaptation of a comic book about a character with human frailties.  Unfortunately so much of the movie is spent on the childhood of the main character that little time is left for action or developing the primary characters.  There are too many characters to introduce and not much is left over for a sequel.  On the plus side, the fluid movements of Daredevil through the rooftops of the city put similar sequences in Spiderman to shame.  Bullseye steals the show, and will hopefully return in a trimmed down sequel.",Daredevil
314,peterinvt,So disappointing from Ben Afleck,1,5 May 2003,"It's hard to believe Ben Afleck of Chasing Amy could be in a such a bad Daredevil flick.  So much time was wasted on character development that there was little time for the story line.  The product placement was somewhat blatant with Daredevil's dad sucking on Heinekeins when he wasn't boxing.  Pabst Blue Ribbon, maybe, but Heinekein??  Like the Batman franchise, the movie went for special effects and fast action over actual story line.  The only really nice special effect was his ""vision"" when the rain hit Electra's face.",Daredevil
315,JackDevoe,Keep up the good comic book movies!,8,18 February 2003,"I had very mixed feelings before I saw this movie. I was wondering if it was going to be good. I was right. Ben Affleck was very good in his performance. Many felt that he didn't fit the Daredevil role, but he showed that he could play it to near perfection. The previews didn't show how serious Affleck was in his role, and this gave hima chance to prove people wrong. Jennifer Garner is making a great transition from TV to film, and she was great as Elektra. She and Ben shared great chemestry, and their foreplay/fight scene was very well filmed. (I thought it was the best fight scene in the whole film.) Special effects were put to very good use for the most part. The scene where Daredevil first ""saw Elektra's face"" in the rain was great. It realy showed how the two characters were falling for each other. I don't remember the details of Daredevil's powers, but I don't know if they were completely dumbed down for the movie. They seemed to have been presented correctly, and it was realy cool how Daredevil knew to start dodging the moment a bad guy's hand touched his weapon. Colin Ferrel and Michael Clark Duncan played great villains. I would have liked to have seen Bullseye's original costume, but he was still sickingly cool. I liked how he even made reference to how he wanted a costume. Michael Clark Duncan was the best choice for Kingpin. Considering how many white actors who could have played him are either good at acting but physically incapable or physically capable but bad at acting, Duncan was able to fill both voids, so it didn't matter that he wasn't white. ( And I'm not the first to think so) I admit the fight scenes could have been filmed better, but they weren't awful. Some special effects where Daredevil and Bullseye turn into CGI made me think back to BLADE 2's weakness, but fortunately it was short. DAREDEVIL is another film where it's fight scenes use the technique of shooting too close and editing too fast, but I knew beforehand that this wasn't a martial arts film. (I would have saw TAI CHI MASTER instead) But the fight scenes overall were good enough. I wish the movie was a bit longer though. 96 minutes just didn't seem like enough time, and another 30 minutes would have given the film makers the oportunity to show more. But this wasn't a horrible thing either. I'm glad I watched this movie, and I reccomend it to all the people who kept their minds open to DAREDEVIL.8 out of 10",Daredevil
316,avidnewbie,"Deftly visualized, Fan friendly effort",7,23 April 2015,"I've just finished watching the Netflix mini-series ""Marvel's Daredevil"" and would like to take the time to compare it with the 2003 feature length movie. The first thing I noticed is that the focus of these two efforts are considerably different in their artistic intentions. The movie, in my opinion, is essentially centered around the portrayal of the costumed hero and his motives and powers. As a result the drama and character back story are conveyed in a by the numbers fashion. With only two hours of run time I totally understand why. Most effective is the depiction of the blind hero on his midnight forays into the heart of Hell's Kitchen. The way he takes in the ""sights"" of the city via it's menagerie of sounds. He knows it's landscape and where it's criminal element resides. We are treated to one of the most insightful depictions of an extra-sensory ability ever placed on screen when Daredevil's radar sense is brought to life in the bar brawl and subsequent subway scene. It is here that the movie sets itself apart from the series with big budget effects, costumes and choreography. I like this movie. Michael Clarke Duncan is perfectly cast as the Kingpin even though he has relatively little to do but look suave and imposing for most of the movie. The final battle scene between he and Daredevil is explosive. The weakest aspect of this movie by far is the character of Bullseye an his portrayal by Colin Firth. He is annoyingly cliché' in his character's mannerism. Jennifer Garner is passable as Elektra although she is not as vicious as in the comics. There are times that this movie suffers from being too lighthearted and others that are melodramatic. Conversely, I did enjoy the nuanced performance of Ben Affleck and the actor that played Foggy Nelson. The series, on the other hand, is focused much more directly on the personal side of our hero and his alter ego and what makes him tick. His day to day interactions with people in general and their tendency to disappoint or exceed expected stereotypes. The organized criminal aspect of Hell's Kitchen is vividly brought to life here with nearly whole episodes devoted to the Syndicate and it's machinations. The Kingpin is nearly given as much Screen time as Daredevil himself and it nearly feels that his story is of equal importance to the creators of the show. It works. You will have a new respect for the events that push these two adversaries and their cohorts toward the series' climactic finale. Even the supporting characters are given tremendous depth here. I like this series. I can appreciate aspects of both the series and the movie. I recommend them both as they deliver different sides to the same story. Sort of like the gospels and their written accounts by respective authors about a common event. Some details corroborate others while others introduce omitted perspectives and observations. To get the total experience consume both efforts.",Daredevil
317,jacobtinsdale,Enjoyable,7,16 April 2015,"Note: Director's Cut Review I found this film to be surprisingly good, and don't understand why it got such low reviews. Ben Affleck was surprisingly quite good in the role of Daredevil, along with Michael Clark Duncan in the role of the Kingpin, and Colin Farrell as Bullseye. Elektra could have had a better actor, but I'm willing to put that aside. Some of the fight scenes were a bit fake, and there are a few errors throughout the film. There also could have been more action in the first half of the film (It was mostly just people talking to each other), but it somehow kept me interested in what was going on throughout the entire thing.I had not seen the film up until a few days ago, and even then I almost didn't watch it (My friends were telling me it was not worth watching), but I did watch it, and I'm glad. While it isn't the perfect film, Daredevil is a good film to just sit back and watch.",Daredevil
318,Troubleboy,Don't expect this movie to turn into a Franchise,2,14 February 2003,"Ben Affleck's best career move beyond this film would be to become Mr. Lopez, because they're not gonna be lining up to give him any $10,000,000 leads based on this piece of rhubarb.It pales in comparison to Spiderman and can't hold a candle to most (excluding the most recent) Batman offerings.  The plot is uninspired, there's far too much 'Love Story'-type music and the action is Jackie Chan (circa 1990) - what exactly was the point of that insipid ballet in the playground?Bullseye is a mediocre villain at best and the less said about KingPin the better - he does smoke a mean cigar though.Next on the tee, Incredible Hulk.",Daredevil
319,Walter_Skinner,Has a few saving graces but ultimately not worth watching.,5,8 August 2011,"My review is actually of the original theatrical cut of Daredevil (but everyone has told me that uncut is far better) Daredevil is a movie that is ultimately a sub par superhero film but actually manages to has a few saving graces. Some of the cons of the movie is that the movie rushes through it's origin. While some movies linger far too long on a characters origin (Malcolm X as a hustler) this one manages to cut shot a lot of drama and tragedy with Matt Murdock losing his eyesight. Ben Affleck is also a very wooden actor and it seems like Jenifer Gardner was phoning it in as well. The movie is also nowhere close to how good the comic is. However, one of the biggest saving graces of the movie is Michael Clarke Duncan. Despite not looking like the original Kingpin he is very intimating and I felt like he was one of the few actors actually delivering a performance in the movie.",Daredevil
320,Nephalim,I'm Confused,4,26 April 2004,"I'm confused because I know that all these actors can do better because I've seen them do better, and I'm also confused why anyone thought that Mark Steven Johnson was the man for the job. His art direction looks like a boring version of Tim Burton's Batman vision, and he must be to blame for the ridiculous story and ridiculous acting.I find that with Ben Affleck, most people really like him, or really hate him, and I seem to be one of the few that think he's just okay. But this just looked painful to him. Murdoch's character just looked like he was playing the brooding loner bit because of the cool factor. He seemed only mildly invested in the revenge story which was apparently his one driving factor in life.Then there's Jennifer Garner, who I think is likely to become one of the better action actresses of her time. She's brilliant on Alias. And if she's a good Elektra, we can barely tell, because she's almost peripheral to the plot, with very little screen time and probably five minutes of actual dialogue. And her character is just as stupid as hell. Since it eventually turns into a revenge crusade for her, the backstory became very convenient for her, particularly with the black leather get-up she just happened to have stowed away. And then, she meets a sort-of blind guy who can still fight exceptionally well, and is surprised when he turns out to be Daredevil.Michael Clarke Duncan is a strange choice for Kingpin. I think he's an exceptional actor, but he's just a huge detachment from the Kingpin of the comics. For one thing, he's too young, for another, he's black, and most important, he seems like an uber-thug more than anything else, whereas the Wilson Fisk character that comic fans came to know and love was an elegant villain. Ruthless and brutal, but elegant. You had no trouble believing that he could fool the public into thinking he was just a very successful businessman.Joe Pantaliano is a great sleazbag, but if he can do more, he certainly didn't show it here. His character was one-dimensional and archetypal. We never got a good idea of why he was so interested in these stories.Colin Ferrell was as over-the-top as he apparently could be. He was amusing, but had very little to his character.But I don't blame the actors. The dialogue and direction was the main culprit, here. Throw in a kitschy soundtrack, and you've got a disastrous comic book movie. It had it's moments, like the Stan Lee and Kevin Smith cameos, but these were few and far between. The plot seemed like it was written by a nine-year-old. I mean, Daredevil is apparently trying to hide his identity, but he walks around as Matt Murdoch brandishing the weapon he uses as a cane? These characters were idiots.And for those of you who aren't aware, Mark Steven Johnson is the director of Grumpy Old Men and Jack Frost (the Michael Keaton movie). So what ever gave anyone the idea that he could handle anything remotely resembling a serious movie, let alone one as dark and brooding as this?",Daredevil
321,yodaschoda,One of the best Marvel movies to date,7,25 January 2005,"Despite the low ratings this movie has gotten from the masses, I honestly can say that this is probably the best Marvel movie to come out in the recent barrage of comic based movies to hit the big screen. I'm guessing the reason for the lack of high ratings is that most people were looking for a super hero along the lines of Spiderman who saves people and is always doing ""the right thing"". Well this obviously isn't the case here, as one can clearly see from how Daredevil does away with the baddies. I personally think that the concept of an avenging lawyer who serves up street justice to those that manipulate the system is a great concept. I also think that everybody did a great job of playing their characters as they should be played, yes I know, even Ben. The only person I thought did a mediocre job was Colin, who only helped to make the already stupid looking Bullseye look even dumber then the character deserves. As you can no doubt guess from reading this, I'm a huge fan of the series. What you probably wouldn't guess is that choosing Michael Clarke Duncan to play the Kingpin is by far the best ""improvisational"" casting choice I've ever seen. For those of you who don't know, the Kingpin is ""supposed"" to be a big white guy we're talking sumo style big. While Michael isn't quite that big, his size and look are by far better then anybody else they could have ever gotten to play this role. So, in conclusion, if you like your hero's on the darker side, a la Batman, then this should be a good choice for you. The effects and story line are great; I can only hope that the only ""acceptable"" attendance at the theaters won't stop them from making a sequel to this movie I know, don't hate me but with Ben playing Daredevil again as well don't worry, I hate myself too!!! And P.S. Elektra isn't a sequel it's a separate plot line all together, although they try to link the two at some point in the movie, but that's another comment for another movie.",Daredevil
322,konya-s,Criminally underrated,6,10 January 2009,"This is one of my absolute favorite comic book movies ever made. It's dark, it's entertaining, it has great story. And I gotta tell that Ben Affleck is great too in the costume of Daredevil. He's great and that's that! I don't know why he was nominated Razzie Award, in my opinion he was awesome. The other actors in the movie are great too! There is Colin Farrell. Usually I not a fan of him, but here, he's gave us an awesome performance as the professional killer the Bullseye. He can kill you with nut. No joke. He's a great character. And there is Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin. Well, I know that in the original comic book, the Kingpin is white, but you know what? Doesn't matter. This Kingpin is similar to the comic book-Kingpin, except the color of they're skin. Both of them are big, both of them are brutal and Duncan has a voice that makes my skin crawl.The direction is perfect I think. Dark and stylish, like a good Batman-movie. The story is good too, because it's not just a typical superhero-story, it is actually a tragedy if you think about that. It has drama and blood, not funny at all, but okay it has some funny moments, but not much.So I don't understand why people hate that movie so much. It's great! Grow up people!

323,kurtman-3,Good with a few glitches,8,15 February 2003,"Daredevil has many good things about it.  The DARKNESS of the movie was refreshing.  The emotions shared between the characters really helped the story move along.  The acting was quite good, especially Affleck, who gave a subtle performance which really clicked with the character.  I thought Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell, and Michael Clark Duncan did decent but unspectacular jobs in their roles.  The Radar vision was cool.  There were only two things I didn't like about this movie.  #1 Although, SOME of the songs were good, none of them belonged in this movie.  They seemed cheesy in some places and just out of place in others. It should have been a more orchestral score.#2 The CGI characters really sucked!  Rarely, if ever was I fooled by these preposterous computer stunt doubles.  They often interrupted decent fight scenes.Through the good and the bad I enjoyed myself.

The direction is beautiful, it understands the character and gives the whole movie a dark atmosphere that other movies have not, it's creative and the director really tries to be innovative, the cinematography is 10/10, really good! The cast is also good, Ben Affleck makes the character nice and the other characters make also a good job. The OST is very good. Elektra is maybe the character that works worse, but it's cool. The villains aren't good villains but, Bullseye is a cool and bad-ass character and Kingpin is frightened and nice. The VFX are good for the early 2000's. Maybe the first act could be slow, but the first action scene where the character is presentated, in the bar, that scene is incredible.Really enjoyable and entertaining, but, please watch director's cut!!!",Daredevil
325,doctorwholittle,As Close as It Can Get to the Comic Book -- UPDATED: Even BETTER Now!!,8,14 February 2003,"There are always liberties that must be taken with comic-to-film characters, & ""DAREDEVIL"" is no exception. However, director/writer Mark Steven Johnson handles these necessary evils with great aplomb & sensitivity, not only with regard to the characters, but also to the fans.Certain aspects of the film I could've done without, or at least would've preferred a bit more in depth explanation if that route was truly the best way to go. Overall, the characters were portrayed as faithfully as they could be without becoming, pardon the pun, a comic book.All of the actors turned in solid performances, & treated their roles with the respect that's due characters who've been around almost 40 years. If this freshman outing is any indication, the ""DAREDEVIL"" franchise is in better hands than the ""BATMAN"" franchise ever was, & stands to rival ""SPIDER-MAN"" & ""X-MEN"" for true fan loyalty. All in all, an excellent comic-to-film project.UPDATE -- Review of ""DAREDEVIL: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT"" DVDWow.Where did THIS movie come from?When I saw DD in February 2003, I thought it was handled as well as could be expected, given the fact that this character, while much beloved in the hearts of Marvel fans, is essentially a second-stringer in popularity (compared to Spider-Man, X-Men, The Hulk & The Punisher). While I wasn't forgiving of some things that were in the film (the fact that Matt & Foggy are DEFENSE attorneys, yet this dialogue wasn't caught in & excised from either version: ""My client is not on trial here. Neither is her testimony."" Well... yeah, she / it IS on trial if you're doing your job right!!), I still feel Mark Steven Johnson did a competent job in writing & directing this movie.Then, I saw the director's cut.With very few exceptions (the trial scene is the same, DD still lets a criminal die when he could've / WOULD've saved him, the PLAYGROUND scene...), this cut is basically an entirely different movie &, in my humble opinion -- having been a die-hard DD fan for almost as long as the character's been around -- this is more along the lines of the movie that DD fans wanted.This original version is far more character-driven & delves into the ""peripheral"" characters a lot more than the theatrical release. It was a shock to see how much Foggy Nelson & Ben Urich (wonderfully played by Jon Favreau & the inimitable Joe Pantoliano, respectively) were cut out of the theartical version.I understand 20th Century Fox's concerns about the movie as MSJ wrote, shot & cut it; as with all things corporate, they were shooting for the lowest common denominator, but DD is not a character that lends himself to that mentality. No offence to Spider-Man, X-Men, or The Punisher, but they're more universal characters, more easily accessed by people across the LCD demographic. The DD renaissance, ushered in by Frank Miller in the 1980s, saved the comic book from cancellation & gave him a newfound popularity, but the character still never achieved the mainstream success of his fellows. Hence the reason that MSJ's original version is much truer to the character than what was initially released to the general public.If you didn't really like this movie the first time around, rent the Director's Cut DVD & give it a second chance.If you liked it the first time around, BUY the Director's Cut DVD & use the theatrical version DVD for a cool-looking coaster!",Daredevil
326,MALPRACTICE,What the hell??? Why ruin so many great characters?,1,26 July 2003,"what a waste, I wont slam the overated Ben Affleck because at least he seems to fit the Matt Murdock role rather well (Playing a whiny, pompous and BLIND man comes quite naturally to a man who is marrying J-Lo and doing stupid movies by that hack Kevin Smith), but the rest of the cast??? I know its gonna be called racist, but PEOPLE COME ON KINGPIN IS NOT BLACK. Nothing against Michael Clark Duncan (in fact him and Pantoliano were by far the two best actors in the film and i'm qite a fan of his) but Wilson Fisk is a HUGE inhuman looking Brute of a  man, not a big towering ""pimp"" as the film made him look. If they wanted to cast someone to play him and couldnt achieve it why not do him in CGI? Elektra was well... not Elektra. Jennifer Garner came off as an even bigger airhead in the film than she did in the movie special she hosted, and her costume was TERRIBLE. I could never lust for her return from death like that of the real Elektra because she was simplistic and plain beyond all stretches of mediocrity. Finally Bullseye... WHAT THE HELL DID THEY DO TO THIS GREAT CHARACTER??? Dont tell me that ""he wouldnt have looked right in movie form"" if that was the case then why have Daredevil look the way he did? They very simply could have made him look like a killer but instead he came off as a overly femme and non threatning goof, more like a patron at a local leather bar. Collin Farrel is a waste if this is the kinda crap he's gonna do and uphold... The plot was crap, the movie carp and even thinking about it enrages me. what the movie truly needed was a quick Cameo by Frank Castle into hells kitchen, maybe he could have ended the misery before it ever began. Speaking of which PLEASE MARVEL, DONT RUIN THE PUNISHER FILM...",Daredevil
327,wilywilliam,Awful,3,14 April 2003,"This movie is bad. The calibre of the actors on show demanded so much more than this weak plot, awful score and terrible script. I always watch a movie with pure escapism in mind. Sometimes I will then notice other things on top of that, such as the cinematography or the soundtrack. This is the first film that has ever had me wondering about the editing. It looks like a patchwork job, with scenes put in the wrong order, other scenes edited out completely, and then scenes that were consigned to the cutting room floor picked up and reused. Character development was glossed over, while the standard comic-book hero touches were made to look and sound ridiculous. My eight year old nephew wasn't even fooled by this movie, and that to me is the biggest giveaway - don't watch a comic-book hero movie that kids don't like. Even John Faverau couldn't save this one.",Daredevil

And Colin Firth's arrogance adds to the character of Bullseye.That's about it.Affleck and Garner were TERRIBLE. The voice-over might have been bad even if Morgan freeman read it, but its unbearable with Mr Affleck's flat, nasal delivery.The action scenes? Totally confusing.Kingpin? Um...

329,rr-777,The Jumex of Superhero Movies,4,1 February 2021,"Jumex is an American emo rapper who makes music that is derivative of other emo rappers. His music is just every emo rap song but worse. But is somehow popular despite this. What does this have to do with reviewing a superhero movie from the early 2000s? Well, like Jumex, Daredevil is a movie that's derivative of every good superhero movie that came out at the time.Bad Things:It rips off the hero origin story thing but instead of a origin that makes sense, we get Matt Murdock's origin in this movie, which is that he got chemicals in his eyes that blinded him, but also gave him ninja skills. Yes, that's really what they go with.It rips off the oveRACtiNg, wacky CArtoOn VILlAin like from Spider-Man one, but instead of well written and interesting character underneath all the cheesy shlock, we have Bullseye. His character is he hates the smell of roses, mugs for the camera a bunch, has the most irish irish accent I've heard. He also can throw things accurately.The other villain is Kingpin, who screams like his arms got ripped off when he gets kicked in the knees. He probably has the worst villain introduction I've ever seen. The camera pans a building to reveal Kingpin as a cheesy song about how someone is an outlaw plays. Subtle.Ben Affleck as daredevil is really bad, his character is not only horribly written, but Ben Affleck's performance doesn't elevate the character in any way. His powers are also inconsistent, in one scene, Dare Devil can hear when someone's lying based on the tiniest inflections in their voice, but in another scene, he has to turn the sprinklers on so he can see the villain in the final fight of the movie. So, yeah, this movies portrayal of Daredevil is pretty awful.Jennifer Garner is in as Elektra who dies very easily when she actually fights someone and is strong and courageous or whatever. She ended up getting her own movie for some reason even though she's the most flat character in whole movie.Good Things:The visualization of Matt's powers is pretty good. I liked the villains even though they were over-the-top and stupid.I think the visual style of the movie is good. Um... yeah I think that's it.Overall, bad movie 4/10",Daredevil

331,lovepade,"Bad plot, bad directing",5,3 July 2003,"I gave this flick 5 out of 10, which might be too hard. However; this is by far the worst (least good) Marvel-film I have seen. First of all, DAredevil is the weakest of the characters. Second, the fighting is not good and thirdly: the villian is as boring as the hero.The truth is that I was plain bored. There was some nice moments with the rain scene, and the first fight between murdoch and the girl. But that was it.(and why does there HAVE to be a comic character like Murdochs partner - its SO predictable... (for the record I love, Batman, Spiderman, Xmen and I CANT WAIT for HULK)!",Daredevil
332,Killa_Cam,"Don't Believe The Haters, This Movie Is AWESOME!",10,29 July 2004,"Not only I have watched Daredevil 4 times in the theater, I also own VHS & watch it regularly. A lot of people misconceived the movie & labeled it as mediocre or even bad. But this movie is no way bad.In fact Daredevil is one of the greatest comic book movies ever along with Spider-Man! (And please don't mention Batman here. Yep, Batman was fun, but what about the meaning?) Some people dare to claim, that DD is a rip-off of Spidey. That's totally not true. I deem Spider-Man & Daredevil are equally brilliant, but they're very different in the same time. While Spider-Man focuses more on the problem of choice between good & evil, the problem of sacrifice, power & personality conflicts, Daredevil brings up the issues of vengeance, justice & the thin line between good & evil. Daredevil is more of an anti-hero compared to Spider-Man, cause Matt takes justice in his own hands & is more of destroyer rather than creator.Ben Affleck is brilliant as Matt Murdock/Daredevil: he totally understood his character & managed to play him credibly. Jennifer Garner's character was quite underdeveloped, but we'll sure see her potential in Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan is an ideal Kingpin, despite many complaints that the role should've been played by a white actor. The race here doesn't play any role I think. Colin Farrell is very great as Bullseye as well, though I've heard some complaints that his costume is different from the one in the comic books. The acting is really great & you'll see it if you really concentrate on the movie, not your pop-corn.Mark Steven Johnson has managed to create a magnificent film noire like atmosphere, which totally suits the movie in a perfect way. The picture is complimented with a great soundtrack, which I have also purchased. The visuals are very good either.I personally can't understand how can anyone rate this movie lower than 7. I mean, if you like comic book movies - you theoretically will like Daredevil. I've heard some comments on how unrealistic this movie is: well, since when comic books are realistic. But Daredevil has got what Batman lacks: meaning, deepness & emotionality. It's not Spider-man, it is different, but equally outstanding & sure worth watching.",Daredevil
333,izzy-19,The best Superhero movie so far,8,7 August 2003,"Trash it all you want, I can kind of see your point.  However, this was the first ""superhero"" movie that fully clicked for me.  It was dark, the costumes were excellent, and the fight scenes were good. 
I don't get the fascination with Spider-Man, X-Men was okay at best, Batman was average, and Superman was, well, Superman.  This had a good feel, pacing, and Ben Affleck was in his first tolerable roll since Dazed and Confused.Oh, and I now get all of the hype about Jennifer Garner.I liked it.  Sue me.",Daredevil
334,Fifth_of_November,One of those superhero movies which deserved better,7,22 May 2015,"First, I can only talk about the director's cut version as I don't even remember about the theatrical release.The movie has its flaws, perhaps the biggest of which is that infamous love scene on the rooftops under the rain where Matt and Elektra fall in love after a 45 seconds, 20 words chat, with Elektra saying ""I have to go"", then Matt says ""stay, it's gonna rain, blah blah"" and then he hears fighting and says ""I have to go"". Ouch.. bad scene, OK. But one bad scene does not make a movie bad.The overall story of DD is nicely written. The origin works, with young Matt losing his father to crime after he became a better man and helped him after his accident. This leads Matt to want to fight injustice, which he does at day by being a criminal lawyer and then at night by being a vigilante. Liked the idea.Most of the movie develops slowly, the way I like it, and builds until a final climax where all the pieces suddenly fall together. And they do fall here.The whole way you think DD is a pretty light movie until Elektra's father gets killed in a violently enough way during a very entertaining scene (first encounter between DD and Bullseye) but then you are not left to rest. The movie reaches another level when comes the fight between Elektra and Bullseye just before the climax. Disturbingly violent but not misplaced, it totally works with the movie despite the shock and the surprise it generates. Also really sets Bullseye as a serious threat and very successful villain character from there.The fight between DD and Bullseye is OK but not memorable but leads to the final scene, with DD going after the Kingpin. I just love how they designed the scene. Simple, old-style fight, 1 on 1 with fists only. No tricks allowed. Perfect finale.Most actors are decent in their role but Jennifer Garner stars as Elektra whereas Colin Farell totally nails it as Bullseye. He's all you see whenever he's on screen, one of the best and most underrated villain performances I can remember. His introduction in a bar shooting darts is a blast and Farell manages to totally captivate without saying a single work. Genius performance.Definitely a superhero movie worth seeing, and makes me miss the time when they made good ones instead of debilitating stuff like Avengers 2 or Iron Man 2/3 with scenarios being only a pretext to an overdose of too many characters and special effects and explosions a la Michael Bay.",Daredevil
335,witheld,Not terrific...but good,9,29 July 2003,"This movie is a classic example of what I like to call the epic syndrome. People are looking for the next epic, like X-Men.  A crashing epic with high, airy concepts to punch around.  They just can't handle a dark movie with plenty of angst that simply plays with hugely enjoyable characters.Matt Murdock is sinking.  In the opening fight scene, he kills a man, very deliberately.  Cuts him in two (with the help of a train).  The rest of the movie is about his struggle to fight crime and not sink headfirst into the morass of evil he fights every day and night.  By day, in the courtroom.  By night... with horns on.  (Love the line: 'and I'm not exactly thrilled about the costume, Mat-thew')Not an epic, but not a movie to miss.  Jennifer Garner turns in her best performance ever as Elektra.  Just an ordinary girl--with butt-kicking karate skills.  Garner handles the physical side of her performance well, but when the angst pops up and her father dies, she handles the emotional side of her character as well.Extra points to Michael Clark Duncan and Colin Farrel; as bad guys, these guys pull the film together and keep it from being bogged down.One of Ben Affleck's best.  The fight scenes are VERY well filmed.This move is a nine out of ten--only because some of the plot creaks of deus ex machina, just a little bit.",Daredevil
336,dsruss-770-941629,"If you MUST watch, get the Directors Cut...",6,28 July 2019,"Theres no overwhelming reason to watch this incarnation of Daredevil. Stick with the Netflix show for all of your ""Devil of Hell's Kitchen"" jollies.

Not a perfect film but a vast improvement over the theatrical cut.",Daredevil
337,max_tony,"Fun, if incomplete",8,10 September 2009,"Daredevil is a better superhero film than most people give it credit for. The direction isn't outstanding, but it's certainly more than competent, and the special effects are quite novel. Ben Affleck, once you get past the personal baggage the actor brings to every role he plays, is an effective Matt Murdock. Jennifer Garner is also strong as Elektra, just please remember to skip that horrid spin-off movie she did. The rest of the cast is an A-list of stars: Colin Farrell, Michael Clarke Duncan, Joe Pantoliano. All are great, and help ground the story emotionally. The problem with Daredevil is that Fox, like with X-Men, fudged the film by cutting out a lot of footage. There's a whole subplot that's missing here, as well as small character moments that give the movie a stronger edge. They don't bring the film to X-Men or Spider-Man levels, but they do raise it significantly. And if you haven't tracked down the director's cut DVD, it's worth a look as well. Otherwise, this 2-disc theatrical edition comes loaded with extras. As appropriate for a movie about the visually impaired, there is a descriptive audio track included among the commentary and enhanced viewing mode options. Lots of documentaries and featurettes on disc 2. The best cut of the film isn't here, but the extras are, so it might be worth your money to view both. A good comic book film missing that extra punch, but still one of the better ones in the recent splurge of comic book movies.",Daredevil
338,BethKyleXYnet,Batman without the cape.,7,15 February 2003,"I just saw the opening night showing with my sweetheart. We were both looking forward to this movie since the first preview. This movie is a lot deeper than other reviews might make it seem.Most people watch comic book hero movies for the action, and there was plenty of that and it was fun to watch and even thrilling at points, but what I really got into was the depth of the inner characters. Ben Affleck did a wonderful job in his role. He made his character sufficiently believable (for a comic book hero) enough that you really sympathized with his inner frustrations.I saw a lot of plot in this movie, man vs self, man vs man, good vs evil, good trying to make sure he's still good, and I liked it. If Jennifer Garner's role was to be male eye-candy she did her job well. Perhaps if I hadn't been looking for more of the Alias character to come out on the screen, I could have better focused on the fact that this isn't Alias and wasn't supposed to be.The Irish hitman was very well done, considering he played a sociopath that provided most of the ""well-aimed"" humor, even if it was a bit twisted. Funny how you can see Colin Farrell as the title role in The Recruit, as well as the lead in the upcoming, Phonebooth.Joe Pantoliano has a great role as the reporter who has discovered the identity of our hero and must decide whether to expose Daredevil, thus furthering his own career, or to keep the masked man's identity a secret and promote him as a good guy. Well done.If you don't like comic book psychology, you won't like this movie. If you do like it, you'll love it as well as the character interaction betwen Affleck and Garner. Mesmerizing.I don't worship Ben Affleck but his appeal has increased quite a bit. I think I'll go see it again. I wouldn't mind a sequel.  It took guts to take on those roles.",Daredevil

Luckily I took a chance and went to see it... It rocks!If you liked Spiderman, you HAVE to see this. DareDevil is deeper, more realistic (hey, it's still a cartoon), and just plain better. Some of the children in the theatre didn't seem to like it at all, which explains that so many people in here dislike it...If you are under the age of 15, I recommend some Disney movie in stead...

It had good acting, wonderful casting, and it was well written and directed. It also had some great music in it.I read the Frank Miller Daredevil comics growing up as a kid, and was very pleased that this movie was true to his interpretation of the character and setting. I was amazed at the amount of detail from the comic that the movie managed to keep. All of the major characters were there and true to form. Best of all, it manages to keep a serious tone and it doesn't get campy or silly. Many people didn't like this movie because of things they view as inconsistencies such as the King Pin being black. That is really sad. This is a wonderful movie.",Daredevil
341,Cristofer Seven,A review for comic book fans.,7,15 February 2003,"I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.  It is true to the comic in a few ways, but Ben is just not a very good actor.  The supporting cast however was very competent.  It is kind of a sad little film.  I never really felt good about the hero and when the movie was over I found myself rooting for one of the villains.  STAY AFTER THE FIRST BIT OF CREDITS!!!!  THERE IS MORE FOOTAGE!!!!  The story just did not have a very good climax. He is just a sad guy motivated by sadness and surrounded by sadness.  The movie did not show more of the noble sides of Daredevil.  I know this is kind of a stupid review, but fans of comics may see my point.",Daredevil
342,puckbond007,"Daredevil-8/10 is a very entertaining, fun, action-packed comic/super hero movie...",8,14 March 2003,"Possible SpoilersDaredevil is a very entertaining, fun, action-packed comic/super hero movie that is dark, intense and a very surprising film...and I left the theatre with a big grin on my face. After seeing the hugely popular and well done Spider-Man last year I said this is how comic book movies should be made and future ones should take note. The makers of Daredevil obviously did...because they have taken that successful and winning formula(literally) but added their own touch and style in the creation of Daredevil. Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdock...the reluctant hero Daredevil, son of a former boxing champ and bullied as a kid. A chemical spill and accident leaves the young kid blind, but his other four senses have now grown accutely more stronger and effective...leaving him with a special ""radar sense"" where sounds bring to life what Matt can't see. This effect in the film is absolutely brilliant and is used very well throughout the entire film...including a beautiful and sad scene involving Elektra in the rain. In his later life Matt fights for justice as a small time lawyer partnered by the very funny Jon Favreau. They represent the innocent and the unfortunate, always seeking truth and justice. At night Murdoch assumes the identity of Daredevil a masked avenger of sorts, fighting for those same down-trodden folk who have been wronged by the system. As reluctant as Murdoch is as Daredevil...the public is as reluctant to accept him as their savior...he is seen more as a villain, an outlaw, an outcast rather than a hero. Daredevil isn't exactly merciful and he is basically seen as a bad guy. The very stong and powerful presence of Michael Clarke Duncan plays Kingpin...mythic crime boss of the city whose exploits seem thwarted by Daredevil and a war of attrition ensues. Matters are even more complicated when Murdoch meets Elektra played by the sexy and strong willed Jennifer Garner, who happens to be the daughter of one of Kingpin's stooges. The man who steals the show is absolutely Colin Farrell as hot-tempered and deadly Irish assassin Bullseye. he chews up the scenery and has loads of fun being an over-the-top villain. This kid Farrell is great and as I said after seeing The Recruit he seems like he can do no wrong. He is a wonderful young talent and has the charisma and style to become a huge star...I just love this dude. Joe Pantaliano also lends some solid support as a tabloid journalist, a role which easily could have become a simple cliche but doesn't. As good as Daredevil is...it is not without its faults. The fight scenes seemed at best pretty average at times and some smoother editing is needed...but as I said this film is darker, more richer than Spider-Man and as it is stands on its own right there with Spidey. Overall Daredevil is a very entertaining comic/superhero movie that takes a winning formula and adds its own style and flair and it boasts an outstanding cast led by the solid Ben Affleck and the talented young Irish assassin Colin Farrell. It's the first can't miss movie of the year and you should have loads of fun watching it.",Daredevil
343,notarepublican,A major disappointment...,6,17 June 2003,"This film has much going for it...Great source material, a better than expected cast, some very good fight choreography.  But it seems to lack a great deal of the heart that made so many of the other recent Marvel films translate so well.  The Marvel characters, particularly Daredevil, succeeded because they were beset by many of the problems that beset regular folks. Romantic problems, job-related stress, family crises, these were the things that Marvel's heroes possessed in common with the rest of humanity. Johnson's Daredevil is not a man with out problems, to be sure, but some much of his world seems so fantastic as to defeat the commonality of those problems or even the nature of the  world in which Matt Murdock lives.I think there is really only one moment that ever overcomes this, and it's easily forgotten.  It's the moment shared by Foggy and Matt in their usual morning coffee shop.  Not the moment where Matt meets Elektra, but the one that occurs at the end of the movie.  The shared empathy and repartee that occurs here is far more real and resonant than anything else in the movie. Other things don't work so well. For example:Nelson and Murdock have a private practice, so why are they representing a woman against her alleged rapist? When are private attorneys ever hired by the state as prosecutors? As far as I know, the only instance when this happened was in the case of Sunny Von Bulow, when a private prosecutor was retained to prosecute Claus, a move that so defied conventional legal practice that it was vigorously opposed by defense council.  And if the defense attorney in Daredevil is to be believed, where would such a woman obtain the resources, let alone the political clout, to hire Nelson and Murdock? And if she could, why hire such an otherwise down and out firm?Murdock's abilities are explained as the product of his new sensory ability, but why would that improve his agility absent some sort of training. At least in Frank Miller's revised version of the Daredevil origin, it is explained that he received some training in the mystic martial arts, but here, he has the accident, then within days (as he is still played by the same actor who has not been aged by dint of effects or reference) is whooping on AJ Soprano and his gang of punks.  Where did that come from?What of the plea from Bullseye to Fisk for a costume? That seems misplaced, as though it should have been on the cutting room floor if there was no follow through.  Other problems include casting.  While many complained about a black man portraying the Kingpin of Crime, I take less issue with it.  I do believe that Michael Clarke Duncan seems miscast as there is very little that ever seems genuinely menacing about him.  Ving Rhames could have played the role and done so much better.  And why would the Kingpin know the impact of sound on Murdock? And where were the rest of his cronies?This films sometimes seems rushed and trapped between the world of light and dark.  A much darker movie could have been made while retaining lighter elements for occasional relief, but the rock score, combined with the over the top performance by Colin Farrell and the lack of a threat that seems posed by Elektra combine for a weird amalgam of light grey rather than dark. Favreau is pretty good, but some of his oafishness could have been toned down (as in the closing scene) while still retaining some sense of comic relief.  Seeing more of Ellen Pompeo's Karen Page (she ought to be a huge name within the next few years) would have also helped to humanize Murdock.Worth it if you're already a fan of the genre, but otherwise avoidable.",Daredevil
344,dblaine316,Another One in the Basket,4,21 April 2004,"Oh man. Like Spiderman, Like Daredevil (DD).But DD is darker.At first when I saw the radar type senses and the likes my hopes for a good movie raised but it was stomped down by the dark stunts and peppy dialogues.The lone highlight is Elektra (Garner). She plays her role beautifully. Magnificiently if I may say so. But her character was cut short and that was a bad move. No matter. I guess her new movie Elecktra will give her what she deserved. Ben Affleck is good. I guess it wasnt his fault that the movie flopped.  But he could have made the movie batter. The villain Bullseye I think, acted very well. But the director has been very harsh on him. He demands a new costume in the movie and on the set. And he was given a new overcoat with sparkles as his new costume.Well as I said another one in the basket. I hope there isnt a sequel to this movie.

345,movieman-1408,a pretty good super hero movie.,7,13 June 2005,yes both spiderman movies were better n both x men movies were. however daredevil is still a lot better than some other superhero movies like hulk and catwomen and Electra. Affleck was a pretty good Daredevil not as bad as i thought he would be. There are people who would have done it better but he still did a good job. The best thing about this movie is i would say the villains. Micheal Clark Duncan was a very good kingpin. It doesn't matter that kingpin was white in the comics Duncan was perfect. Farell also was very well cast as Bullseye. He did a good job too. The best fight scene in the movie though was the one between kingpin and daredevil. I don't think Electra needed to be in this though. 2 villains were enough. She should have been saved for the sequel if they do one or her own movie. I don't know if they r doing a sequel maybe they just did Electra instead i don't know. I would see a Daredevil 2 if they made it though. I hope they use kingpin again.,Daredevil
346,neo_jenner,"Not perfect, but surprisingly good",8,15 February 2003,"I was impressed with this movie.  I don't really like Affleck much, but he did a very good job here.  His character was dark and he obviously seemed to have more on his mind than his usual characters do.  He didn't act like a dork the way he normally does.The action, acting, and production were all top notch.  However, this movie supposedly cost $80 million, but I don't see where it went.  There aren't any huge action sequences.  It's a relatively small movie.  Dark and brutal. More like The Crow than Spider Man (Thematicly speaking).My complaints would mostly be that it wasn't dramaticly heavy enough. The story wasn't as well developed as Batman, Spider Man, or Superman.  And Kingpin was very underdeveloped.  It was also too short.  Just about an hour forty five minutes.  It should have been twenty minutes longer.  And for a movie that takes place in New York, there seems to be only ten or so people in the whole city at times.And I'll give it credit, for what seems like a cookie cutter Hollywood movie, it's got one shocking twist no one will see coming.  And it took guts to do it.",Daredevil

Just watch Alias. This is the worst comic book movie I have ever seen or heard of. Just the memory of Ben trying to convince himself as well as the audience ""I'm not the bad guy"" makes me shudder.

Then after killing all the lackeys he lets the big boss live because he has discovered he was wrong in all the killing.  This is the one person in the movie that really should be killed?

350,punyerd,Underrated,6,11 June 2020,"This movie had a decent storyline, it was pretty comic accurate, Ben Affleck did a great job at Daredevil and Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan did a great job at Bullseye and Kingpin. Jennifer Garner is terrible as Elektra, but all the good things about this movie managed to save it in my opinion. I think this was also the case for Suicide Squad. Same positives as this, but Jared ruined it massively. The only difference is that I found Suicide Squad better than this. Overall, Daredevil is good, but if you want to see a better, darker, more comic accurate representation of Daredevil without Jennifer Garner ruining it, then watch the Daredevil TV show or The Defenders with Charlie Cox. But this still deserves to be watched and it is definitely not as bad as a lot of people think. However, the ""sequel"", Elektra, IS as bad as a lot of people think. Avoid THAT movie by watching this one.",Daredevil
351,robsha,On the brink of the absurd,3,2 September 2003,"I was looking forward to watching this movie with my son and 20 minutes into the movie I was looking forward to it being over. The story was unbelievable and downright hokey. Ben Affleck was unbelievable as an both a blind person and as an action hero. He looked stilted and uncomfortable.
""Electric Nachos"" as my son was wont to refer to Jennifer Garner's character was also written badly. She however at least could pull off the action scenes. I think she could take Ben in a real fight. The quick change from being hostile to being deeply in love between the two was fast and loose.I think I liked Affleck's friend the best played by John Favreau of swingers fame although he was on-screen maybe 5 minutes. Collin Farrell was way over the top but at least enjoyable as a bad guy. Affleck needs to stay out of the action. The best thing about this movie was the ""vision"" effects but I couldn't see how seeing sounds would help you dodge bullets. Daredevil came off as a poor splicing of spiderman and batman.

352,mrtacoman,"Another great Marvel film, Ignore the Critics",9,14 February 2003,"Marvel Comics has proven that they can best Warner Bros. superhero franchises and do it with style. Daredevil rocks, plain and simple. Is it as good as Spider-Man? I'd say the answer is no, but it comes really really close. I'd put it on par with X-Men, maybe even a little better as Daredevil stayed closer to its comic roots than the X-Men film did. The action is solid, the story is great, and the acting was best from Affleck and Duncan. Jennifer Garner did okay and Colin Farrell's Bullseye wasn't bad at all. I'll be seeing this movie again, definitely. One critic said that the movie was put out there to sell the soundtrack. Well, the soundtrack is also well worth your money. All the songs fit right in with the scenes they were chosen for. Ignore the movie critics folks. Remember, those guys are just people who wish they could make a movie, but can't because they lack the talent and inspiration. When it all comes down to it, their opinion doesn't mean anything.

353,PackmanWSU01,Special Effects do not make a movie,4,3 August 2003,"Yeah, it's a comic book movie, but it's lacking something. It's nowhere near as great as the first Batman, or the X-Men movies. My guess is that Affleck just wasn't right for the role. The tender moments in the movie seem forced and contrived. And the director fails to make the whole scenario remotely plausible. No willing suspension of belief here. But that's to be expected when your blind hero jumps off of buildings for no reason, seemingly just to wow the audience.",Daredevil
354,natport19,not just another comic book movie,7,12 March 2003,"Superman and Batman are arguably the two best superheroes of all time. Daredevil is arguably the least known.  All recognition aside, comic books' presence in cinema is palpably apparent throughout the last few decades. Whereas Spiderman grossed enough money to spawn a sequel already in the works, Daredevil would be lucky to make a profit big enough to approach head executives in hopes to begin talks for a follow-up.  With Hulk, X2, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen due out later this year, adding competition to the long list of comic book movies, it seems as though Daredevil will be unfortunately forgotten.  Even though, it may be the best of them, as it certainly is since the visions of Tim Burton, with only Bryan Singer's X-Men in close competition, it may be too dark and honest for the people, excluding diehard fans, who go to see it expecting just another comic book movie.The key to the movie's success is pivotal casting.  Unlike Spiderman, Daredevil actually caters to a PG-13 audience.  Do not expect bloodless battles similar to those involving teenage heartthrob Tobey Maguire.  The gory battles verge on heresy at some points in one of the movies most passionate scenes.  Second, of course, to the rooftop scene between Affleck and Garner in which Murdock uses the vibrations of the rain to paint a portrait for his mind's eye of Elektra.  Absurd as it may be, it results into a moment more romantic than any of the last few romantic comedies could ever fester.Although Mark Steven Johnson is a newcomer when it comes to directing action movies, he never seems to be an amateur.  His fight scenes are as engaging as his comic book-like dialogue.  You may think that it is cheesy, but what isn't cheesy about a comic book?  Daredevil turns its frames into an adaptation for the big screen.  And it works wonderfully because of the heart in its filmmakers and in its cast, including top of the line performances by Farrell and Duncan as the two villains.  With this in mind, there might still be hope for a sequel to answer some of the open-ended questions.*** out of ****",Daredevil
355,ironbutterfly,"The worst superhero movie, next to The Punisher staring Lundgren",1,15 February 2003,"Terrible, from the first minute to the last.  It was rushed more than X-Men, and at least that movie had some sort of a plot; this movie had none. Terrible screen writing, awful direction, sucky acting, and terrible editing.  Jennifer Garner was only in the movie for 15 minutes and when she was it was a rip off of Batman Return's Catwoman. Colin Farell was the model of over acting. Michael Clark Duncan was a rip off of Ving Rhames Marsellus in Pulp Fiction. Ben Affleck was awful as usual.  I would like to type down what this movie was about, but frankly, I don't even know myself.  Do not make a sequel to this Pulp Fiction, Batman, Batman Returns, Superman, Spider-Man, and probably Dude where is my freakin' car.  I typed down a review of Spider-Man a few months ago, and I wish I could take it down because this movie gave me a huge respect for Spider-Man; the all out best superhero movie of all time, and that IS saying much.",Daredevil
356,chewbar7,Awful,1,17 March 2003,"Yet another example of crap comic book adaptions and this is the worst of the lot. The acting from Affleck is laughable and his voice over and the beginning is even worse. Jennifer Garner's performance was midly more bearable but still poor, whilst Michael Clarke Duncan - except not being able to smoke a cigar properly - and Colin Farrell were brief relief from the poor performances. And when i say ""brief"" i mean ""brief"". Their screentime is minimal which was also disappointing. To me, the director seemed to be more bothered about adapting the story from the comic book correctly rather than concentrating on ANYTHING else. For anyone who hasn't seen this film, DON'T!",Daredevil

The thing is, this line has ABSOLUTELY NO RELEVANCE AT ALL AS HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DIE!!!!! The worst thing about the entire film though, incuded the said line and it was the awful voiceover by Ben Affleck. Closely followed by Michael Clarke Duncan's inability to smoke a cigar.",Daredevil
358,MrP823,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,15 February 2003,"(Possible spoilers I suppose)Could they have made a more predictable and otherwise unimaginative film here? Anytime we go to see a movie centering around a superhero we expect to find the typical elements. We know we'll see a man living a double life. We know we will see this man fall in love with a beautiful woman. We know he will eventually confront the forces of evil. However, there is still some room for creativity here. This film takes no chances whatsoever and leads the audience to absolutely nowhere. There is no real story to this film except a weak framework that weaves those three simple elements already mentioned together in amateurish-like fashion.Although I think at least some form of a story is always a necessity in order for a movie to work, I was willing to overlook this huge problem if, and only if, the film provided action sequences that would leave me on the edge of my seat. That unfortunately never happens as well. Most of time, we simply cannot even see what in the blue hell is going on during these fight scenes. The camera work during these Matrix-like fights is tainted with irritating fast cuts.  Making it nearly impossible to enjoy a fight in which I cannot even see the martial art techniques being performed. I won't go off on CGI in this review because I often times enjoy its use but when it doesn't work, it fails miserably to generate any real thrills.
When an action-filled superhero film fails to service its audience with good action, what is the audience left to enjoy then? Better yet what is the audience supposed to enjoy when they have seen this same movie many times over? Only this time around, there is even less to observe with excitement than most other superhero flicks.(spoiler) By the way, that scene in the children's playground where two complete strangers begin Kung Fu fighting for no apparent reason has my vote for being the most ridiculous scene in a film within the past three years. Three years at the very least.",Daredevil

Don't pass on it just because you don't like Ben Affleck. He is VERY good in this movie. If you are a Daredevil fan like me, you will appreciate the amount of work that went into this movie. The character Daredevil is not a billionaire with gadgets or a superhero with powers. He is more of a normal guy with a special ability. He fights for justice, he feels guilt, he gets beat up, and he gets scars. Some of the action scenes are a little blurry, but overall I liked Daredevil. It's not a perfect movie, but it is well-written and acted. It's hard to make a movie like this and not be cheesy. There are almost no cheesy parts.This is not Spider-Man. This movie is dark and gritty and somewhat violent for a PG-13 movie. I loved it. I can't wait for the sequel. Note: Be sure to stay after the credits to see what happens to Bullseye.",Daredevil

However I left the cinema with a big smile on my face. The cast were faultless with great performances, especially from Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell. The tone of the film was just right with the darker feel attributing to a much more enjoyable film than the campy 'Spiderman'.

It was ridiculous! I love action movies and especially superhero movies. This was just dumb. I can basically break it down to a name. Nachos! Electra's last name is Nachos! Or actually Nacheos but couldn't they think of something more creative? She looked great in the hand to hand scenes with Ben but the part when she started using those big knives at her house was real stupid. Bullseye actually says ""I want a bloody costume."" What? Also there is a scene where Bullseye starts flying around the tops of the buildings. One other question before I finish is How can Daredevil fly around buildings like Spiderman? Why does he use a cain to walk but can kick the crap out of a room full of people? Got my money back. Please, don't see this. Dumb idea Ben and Jennifer couldn't save this crappy movie. Ben Affleck was pretty good, but this should of never been made into a movie. Dumb idea for a super hero. A handicapped superhero? P-lease.",Daredevil
362,doombot3,Ron Stewart...you took the words right out of my mouth !,7,3 August 2003,"DD was never a favourite of mine, though I was familiar thanks to his appereances in Spiderman (Marvel Super heroes). If you all have read Ron's review you already now my thoughts about the movie, but in my own words:great movie with a flawed ending.the CGI makes you feel like your in DD's world, so in one word: outstanding ! A dark and gritty movie with great casting, all actors seemed if they really belonged there.I have only 1 minor problem with the Kingpin, why couldn't they find a white actor ? (in Spiderman and Daredevil comics he's white) this almost feels like he was cast as an afterthought.the problems I had with the ending :I never liked Bullseye as a character, so I really didn't like him in the movie. the End-fight is what made this movie from greatness into a merely good movie, the Elektra character is easily subdued by Bullseye (not killed). DD flees halfway though the city (being severly hurt) to the Church where Bullseye follows him, DD slumps to the flour (half-dead from blood-loss ?) only to duke it out with Bullseye 1 minute later fully recovered !this was totally unbelievable and to make matters worse after that he happily goes off to the Kingpin's penthouse and fights another bit?! Kingpin is no pushover (he gives Spiderman a good fight !in the comics) and has one of the greatest lines: you don't have much time DD, I called the cops on you. DD: why? Kingpin: well, your tresspassing in my penthouse and I'm a respecatable bussinesman I have nothing to fear from the police. or some words to that effect (haven't seen DD since the theater), which perfectly sums up the Kingpin as the untouchable crimelord.all in all a 7/10, could have been better.",Daredevil
363,willstrong79,It was pretty good,8,7 May 2007,"Okay so it is not Batman or Spider-man. But what we have is special. Marvel comic characters are always interesting and I think Ben Affleck brought a true since of moodiness to Daredevil. Daredevil at times reminds me of Batman. Let's be honest if this film came out in 1990 we would love. It is because of Spider-man Daredevil get's push aside. But what makes me like any action film is the story and its character. The Kingpin is cool and so is Bullseye who is among one of my favorite Marvel villains portrayed on film.In short we have here a movie that if you pretend like there are no other superhero films , that pulls off its source material nicely. Pretty good!!!",Daredevil
364,r-lythgoe,Don't Understand The Hate,7,19 September 2014,"Daredevil is a superhero movie that gets a lot of hate from fans, with a lot of them deeming it to be one of the worst superhero movies. Sorry, but I don't really understand the hate. I can DEFINITELY understand the hate towards the ABYSMAL spin-off Elektra, released a couple years after this in 2005, but this I just don't really get.There's no denying the movie has some flaws: The Kingpin is pretty much wasted as a villain for most of it despite the great performance by Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP), Jon Favreau is downright INSUFFERABLE as Matt's friend and partner (I can't even remember his name), a lot of the movie feels shortened and there is a massive plot hole as to how the police found out Fisk was the Kingpin.(Most of these flaws are actually fixed anyway on the Director's cut, which I agree is much superior to the actual film. So you should DEFINITELY buy the director's cut. Just saying) However, I think this is a highly underrated movie. Ben Affleck is an actor who seems to get a lot of hate, but I quite like him as an actor. Sure, he's appeared in abominable films like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon, but I think he's a good actor and an even better director as he's recently proved. He does a good job in this film as Matt Murdock/Daredevil and manages to make the character seem very believable on screen. He also has great chemistry with Jennifer Garner(who is decent as Elektra), which you would expect since they are kind of....married now. I've already mentioned how good MCD was, but Colin Farrell is also terrific as Bullseye and he pretty much owns every scene he is in.On to the actual plot, I thought it managed to adapt Daredevil's character very well, it was very enjoyable, it had a great moral behind it and most of the action scenes were pretty well filmed. I also enjoyed the bleak and dark feel of the film. It was a very refreshing change from other superhero movies. I also love the music in this film, especially the credits song ""Won't Back Down"" and ""Wake Me Up Inside"".Overall, a decent and underrated superhero movie which I always enjoy watching.",Daredevil
365,mj68538,I should have guessed Daredevil would be diabolical,2,20 December 2015,"Hmm, I had reasonably high hopes for this movie (esp bearing in mind how much better the later series is), not enough to see it in the cinema or enough to rent it, but enough to waste a couple of hours watching it on TV when it finally came on, and I wish I hadn't bothered. Supposedly the director's cut is better, but tbh I can't really imagine it improving this pile of over-cgi'd tosh much, and certainly not enough to warrant me wasting another couple of hours.Way too long was spent pointlessly building up Daredevil, and then his relationship with Elektra - you still didn't feel any kind of bond or empathy for them so the first hour or so was a complete waste of time. They went to all the bother of building up Daredevil's relationship with Elektra (or at least trying to, the acting was soo wooden he might as well have been having a relationship with his cane), only to summarily kill her after a particularly lame scene where she tries to kill Daredevil after wrongfully thinking he assassinated her father, only to remove his mask, realize it's her boyfriend and then suddenly go all 'Woops! Ooh, I'm so sorry!'. A far more likely reaction would be 'You bar steward! You only slept with me to get close to my father! Here, take this sai through the throat!'. But even given that, it was still disappointing they didn't have a few minutes as a 'crimefighting duo' where they kicked some bad guy butt before she was killed.And it then went on to a similarly disappointing fight with Kingpin. Oh, I blinked. Is it over? Oh well, there goes two hours of my life down the toilet.But even given all that, I would probably still have given it three stars (there are much worse movies out there, like Battleship), but it loses an extra star for spawning the worst spin off ever made - Elektra. A film so bad I can't review it because I can't think of ten lines worth of similes for the word 'excrement'.",Daredevil
366,rupture10,"If the fact that Ben Affleck is staring doesn't scare you, watch it.",4,23 December 2005,"Ben Affleck is horrible in this role, but then again, when is he not. Jon Favreau is the only actor I pity for I know that there was gun put to his head and he was FORCED to sign a contract, a lot like in the Godfather. Jennifer Garner was... Blah. A 2- dimensional actress, with a character cliché'd and with a double digit IQ, this is not a good film. You might like it if you and your friends are drugged, if not, I wouldn't consider renting this. I wouldn't buy it if I were high. As retarded as Forrest Gump, Ben Affleck (whom did NOT help write Good Will Hunting) is mediocre and shameful. He isn't talented enough to trick a person into thinking McNuggets are safe, therefore, he shouldn't be allowed to show himself in front of a camera(including photographs). Please, stop the vicious cycle, tell your friends that this is more dangerous than cancer, DON'T WATCH IT!",Daredevil
367,erasmus-4,A Horrible Waste of Time,2,10 March 2003,"I wanted to wait for video on this one, but somehow backed out of my promise and ended up paying full price for it this past weekend.  What a mistake.  I have seen almost all comics movies, and I know that some suspension of disbelief and ability to overlook cheesiness is required, but this goes way beyond that.  It's just barely better than Batman & Robin, the widely acknowledged worst comics movie ever.Poor dialogue, rushed storyline, and choppy and confusing action sequences are just some of the reasons why you should stay away from this one.  Oh, and did I mention a simply horrible soundtrack that made me wish my superpower was to be deaf?  I am a huge comics fan, but this movie was a mistake.  To take a mostly great cast, and to have the only good performance come from about 50 seconds of Jon Favreau, is a travesty.",Daredevil

369,madnessx69,Back to basics action (Beware Spoilers),10,15 February 2003,"I watched this 2 days ago, and was attempting to decide how much I liked the movie. I knew I liked it, but I wasn't sure why or to what extent. As it turns out, I REALLY like this movie. Why?? Because it's taking action movies back to what they're supposed to be. Violent!! In recent years, action movies, at least the big blockbuster types, have watered down the violence, and resorted to merely leaving people with cuts and bruises or unconscious rather than killing them. Charlie's Angels is a good example of this type of movie, where anyone who gets killed is in some sorta huge explosion or it's implied off screen. Don't get me wrong, I don't wanna see violence for the sake of seeing violence. But lets use the other superhero movies of late as an example; X-Men. great movie, but all these super-powered mutants fighting and blowing stuff up and nobodies' killed?? If only the real world were that forgiving. Spiderman. Same sorta deal. All the bad guys are held up in webbing and no one gets seriously hurt. (There are exceptions, but stay with me.)In DD, we start out with him chasing down a rapist who gets sliced in half. Bullseye kills an old lady who annoys him with a peanut. People get stabbed, shot and thrown out 3 story windows. This is what action movies have lacked lately, things need to be at stake and lost. Innocent people need to die in order for a real sense of peril to be established. If we know that all the bad people will die or be arrested and the good people will live, there's nothing to root for, you just need to wait it out. DD is comparable to Burtons Batman movie, still my favourite comic book flick. It's dark, violent and suprisingly emotional. Ben Affleck (who I dreaded seeing as DD by the way) is suprisingly good in this movie, maybe because he's hidden half the time by either the mask or shades, and he doesn't over do any of the parts. Collin Farrel is high energy and beautifully volatile. And rest assured that MCD can pull off Kingpin, he's intimidating and the whole ""Bronx"" line fit his character perfectly.My only complaint is that on rare occasions, this movie does delve into the ""silly"" or kiddish realm, but I guess it's to be expected considering the content.Overall, I give this movie a 7.5 out 10.",Daredevil
370,solacewaves,The devil beware,7,26 August 2009,"Comic book fans should enjoy this movie creation based on one of Marvel Comics most successful titles. Coming off the box office bunnies of other comic-to-movie adaptations such as Spider-man and X-Men, the Marvel comic lore is a treasure trove for movie makers and with special affects and CGI now comfortably at the point where they are capable in suspending our belief that super powers can possibly exist, the comic book feats of Daredevil are very much on the big screen for everyone to see.The story of Matt Murdock, a man who by day fights for justice as a blind lawyer (having lost his sight in a toxic waste spill) and by night a dispenser of said justice to those who escape the court system using acrobatic martial arts and sixth sense ""radar"" capabilities (imbued by the same toxic waste that made him blind) is one for whom generally all comic book fans would cheer for.Ben Affleck playing the title role is supported admirably by the stunning Jennifer Garner (Elektra), the suitably imposing Michael Clarke Duncan as the evil nemesis Kingpin and the psychotically endowed Colin Farrell as Daredevil's main adversary Bullseye.All play their parts with suitable relish and the chemistry between Affleck and Garner is evident (as this was the movie which eventually led to a relationship in real life).Overall an enjoyable ride and far superior than the disastrous spin-off movie based on Garner's character Elektra. If I was to be nit-picky, I'd point out that Kingpin is actually a giant white guy in the comic book series but Duncan encapsulates all the necessary qualities of the ""Crime Boss Overlord of New York City"" admirably and was a fine choice in the end.What probably prevents this comic book movie from reaching loftier heights is the lack of character empathy between their interactions. Bullseye is simply a mercenary for hire and his ""hatred"" for Daredevil is not really felt. Further exploration between Daredevil and Kingpin would've resulted in greater gravitas but this most likely would have resulted in less time for Elektra's character and potentially less box office dollars. Still an enjoyable popcorn movie in my books.",Daredevil
371,pat-pat,Good but flawed superhero movie,7,12 January 2009,"This is a review of the directors cut. I was 9 years old when i first saw this movie with my dad and of course I thought it was awesome. Now nearly 6 years later i decided to pick this up on Blu-ray. I hadn't seen the director's cut version until just now and simply put it is a great improvement over the theatrical version. It is darker and grittier thanks to a whole scenario involving a murder of a prostitute and the trial following that Matt Murdock decides to join in on. The romance between Affleck and Garner has been less emphasized to put more emphasis on Daredevil's crime fighting in Hells Kitchen.Pros: A interesting superhero film set in realism, Jon Favreau's comic relief, More depth to characters and story thanks to Director's cut and a pitch perfect origin to Matt Murdock becoming Daredevil that is faithful to the comics Cons: Colin Farell's overacting as Bullseye, A few cringe worthy lines here and there, Ben Affleck wasn't the right choice but does what he can with the role",Daredevil
372,the_saint_107,Gets worse the second time you see it.,6,24 February 2003,"The whole idea of this film about a bloke who goes about kicking people in, sounds quite good to a film fan who doesn't balk at carnage.
However the film never gets past that idea. The plot is dull, the acting is terrible. Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan were Ok but hardly given any screen time, Jennifer Garner made the most of the role despite it being as skimpy as what she wears. Affleck was just appaling saying terrible lines mixed with lines that could have been quite good had he had any talent.
The characters were poorly developed and alot of the time I was left wondering exactly why they were doing what. There was no real reason for the fight in the playground save for entertainment value and it wasn't a particularly good fight.Affleck's v.o. during the flashbacks to his childhood were just embarassing, that sequence could have been ok if it weren't for that.Seeing as there was next to no character development I figured only fans of the comic would be able to explain how being blinded and gaining superhuman senses also gave him great shock absorbers in his legs so he could fall for miles and not shatter both legs. Was Bullseye some kind of radioactive freak as well, that would explain how he catches glass at superhuman speeds and can defy the laws of physics whenever he throws something. Not knowing the comics I had no idea how they were able to do this. Also I know he could see sounds so he could have slight vision when it rained, but how could he see Garner's teeth unless rain was hitting them, and the different parts of the eye too.The music in it was poor also. Graeme Revell's score wasn't bad. but the rest of the time there was tracks that seemed to have little relevance to what was going on.It's greatest falling was when it began to take itself way too seriously. I liked the idea of the gritty violence in it. However it's a film about superheros wearing leather jumpsuits flying about It shouldn't take itself seriously. When it began to take itself seriously and SPOILERS HERE the only likable hero died. Even the charisma of Clarke Duncan and Farrell couldn't save it for me. After that moment I really couldn't care less wether all the characters died or lived happily ever after.Now onto the good parts. Yuen Cheung Yan is a good fight choreographer and the fights were well choreographed if alot of the time they couldn't convincingly pull off certain moves.However the editing of a string of closeups cut together really quickly so you can't see what's going on defused the excitment of the fight sequences. Also the most powerful man in New York being defeated by a kick in the knees!!! Getting sucked out of an airplane or running out of a barn guns blazing into a hail of bullets is a good way to loose, but having a blind man boot your knees really isn't.The photography was good and the visual effects were slick, making the film have quite a cool feel to it and a slight ""wouldn't mind going to see it again""This really must be a film for fans as maybe they can give it there own character developement and plot. If it had been an film about Bullseye or Elektra maybe it'd have been better but it wasn't. Shame.",Daredevil
373,gorflax,Marvel's movies are becoming mediocre.,5,15 February 2003,"I just saw DareDevil and I must say I cannot recommend it.  The dialogue is pathetic, the fighting scenes way too over the top, and the plot is so thin you could see right through the screen.  Now I understand this is a comic book film, but the reason these movies became popular was because films like X-Men raised the standards and added plot and convincing characters.Marvel seems to just be in this one for the cash as this movie is missing all depth.  It is pure eye-candy and I don't even know if it's candy my eyes want to try.  Besides the Matt Murdock/DareDevil (Affleck) the rest of the characters are wooden and basically just set up to provide an environment. The villains aren't even interesting.  Bullseye (Colin Farrel) is despicable as he should be but his role is too short to be of any consequence or for his character to save this film.  Oh and don't get me started on the music which is purely repulsive and consists of horrid pop songs.  For some reason the film makers decided it would be good to throw in a song during every action scene.  This is a sad way to commercialize music and unfortunately it is used too much these days as it is prevalent in most action movies.  The positive things about this film would be Ben Affleck's performance and the fight scenes which are very well coreographed.  The problem also lies in that these scenes are too over the top that at one point I was wondering whether I was watching a Jon Woo film.Hopefully The Hulk will go back to the X-Men/Spiderman formula of good characterization and stronger plot and redeem themselves.  After seeing this film I am very unsure if I will go to see another Marvel inspired film in the theatre.  I'll wait for the DVD thank you very much.** and that's more than it deserves!",Daredevil
374,amishguy,A disgrace to movies and comics alike. (Spoilers),3,20 February 2003,"Ok, so I felt that this was the worst movie of the year and the whole time watching it I was thinking to my self...How could this be any better than the Roger Corman's F4 movie.  This movie had the worst dialogue I have ever heard in a movie.  And that's including some of the movies I questioned even having scripts.  No doubt, Ben Aflec (Who was very unconvincing as Daredevil) ad-libbed 90% of his part, which camed out as a smug, smart-allec loser.  The only good charicter was Bullsey, but the poor directing took alot of his blood lust and made it lack any impact when he killed somebody. And as for those who say this was a good adaption.  The only scene well adapted was the Elektra death scene.  The rest was crap.  For one Daredevil never believes in the justice system.  He wouldn't go around killing people to exalt revenge.  That's what the Punishers job was.  And how about that Bullseye ""Death scene.""  Must we forget that Bullseye has a skeleton of Adamantium.  That fall wouldn't have fased him.  And my favorite, what about everyone just figuring out Daredevil's Identity.  No body took off his mask, one of Matt Murdock's girlfriend figured out his secret alterego and sold his Identity to the kingpin.

Too many plot holes and little carachter development are key bad points. Still, it was enjoyable to watch, gave it a 7/10. Now the DC's out...and it feels so much better to watch. The side story adds depth and makes you care more about the characters and their motivations. Ben Urich, King Pin, Bullseye, Foggy Nelson...they have a much better treatment on the DC. The funny sequences with Foggy help break the prevailing too dark atmosphere. Also, the wrap-up of the story has all the gaps filled.I gave the DC a 9/10.

The casting of the film in my opinion was great, especially king pin's actor that surprised me with good review. However the story lacked so much, not really explaining much about DareDevil or his love for Elektra. It just focused so much on pointless action. With that said, the film gets a 5/10 for somewhat good action and acting. NOW, i will say go to your DVD retail store and grab the uncut version of the film which is about an hour longer with a very different yet better story line. This film was what should have been released into theaters. This uncut version explained what made daredevil, his life, and a better chemistry story between Elektra and him. The action was far better and pointless scenes from the theatrical version never showed itself in this film. I mean it, go watch the uncut version of this film, it's simply brilliant that deserved to have been released in theaters to begin with. This version gets a 10/10. Of course, it's just my opinion. You decide in the end.)",Daredevil
378,Craig87-1,The Director's Cut Is My Personal FAVORITE Superhero Film!,9,6 September 2009,"I grew up in the 70s and 80s. My favorite comic heroes included The Thing, The Fantastic Four, Conan, The Flash, Wolverine, The X-Men, Captain America (and the Falcon), Tarzan, Spider-Man and Daredevil. What intrigued me about Daredevil was that, although he was very similar to Batman (and, to a lesser extent, Spider-Man), he was BLIND! Daredevil really started to get hot when Frank Miller and, later, Ann Nocenti wrote for the comic in the 80s (Nocenti's run started out fairly unimpressive but slowly became outstanding). With this understanding I was naturally excited to see the film rendition of ""Daredevil"" that debuted in February 2003. After seeing the movie I thought it wasn't bad. They got a lot of stuff right -- like Daredevil's costume, the mood and the casting (this was my first exposure to Ben Affleck so I had no beef with him playing Matt Murdock/Daredevil). Still, there was something wrong with the picture; it was too light and brisk. Yes, it certainly had pizazz (unlike, say, ""Batman Begins""), but it was mostly superhero fluff with little depth -- a perfect example of style over substance. Plus the cutesy playground scene where Matt first meets Elektra was completely out of place. We NOW know what went wrong: Some studio dork made the idiotic decision to cut out the meat of the story. This naturally DUMBED DOWN the film. In plain language: THE FILM WAS GUTTED!! All I can say is: Thank God for director's cut DVDs! Two years after its theatrical release I picked up the new Director's Cut of ""Daredevil"" and was completely BLOWN AWAY! The director, Mark Steven Johnson, took out some unnecessary fluff, like the premature Matt/Elektra sex scene, and added over 30 minutes of material that was completely INTEGRAL to the story and SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN CUT in the first place! This new material centers around the characte-defining subplot of Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson working on a case that ties into the whole Kingpin storyline. The fight scenes are also vastly superior in the Director's Cut. WHAT WORKS: Everything about this film magically ""works."" Colin Farrell is entertaining as the crazed Bullseye, Jon Favreau is splendid as Foggy and Michael Clarke Duncan is outstanding as The Kingpin, yeah, I know they deviated with the skin color, but who gives a hoot anyway? The soundtrack, which includes selections from various heavy rock bands, is truly stupendous: The touching moments are truly touching, like when Matt & Elektra share intimate moments on the roof and Elektra's solo workout, and the kick-a$$ parts are really kick-a$$. Two great songs by Evanescence are featured: ""Bring Me To Life"" and ""My Immortal."" There are a lot of great dialogue lines in this film as well, in particular from The Kingpin and Bullseye (""Tell me, how do you kill a man without fear?"" ""By putting the fear IN him""). Daredevil's origin story is also perfect: emotionally charged but not over-long or needlessly complicated (like ""Hulk""). One of the greatest successes of this film is simply the MOOD. It's dark and reverent at the same time. Daredevil is perfectly portrayed as the tortured loner; Affleck does a fantastic job! WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The aforementioned cutesy playground scene was obviously put in just for fun (to liven things up at that point), but it doesn't belong; it destroys the believability of the picture and characters. It should have been omitted from the Director's Cut. Still, it's not that bad. I can tolerate it; and I admit that it IS a fun scene, if nothing else. Jennifer Garner is awesome, we all know that, but she doesn't really fit the character of Elektra from the comics. She has a quality to her disposition that's simply too innocent, pure and likable (not that these are bad traits, of course; they just don't fit the character of Elektra, an assassin). Kelly Hu, who played Lady Deathstrike in X2, would've been the perfect choice. Still, I personally don't mind Ms. Garner in the role; it's an acceptable deviation (one must allow some latitude in comic-to-screen adaptations). BOTTOM LINE: ""Daredevil: The Director's Cut"" ranks up there with the best superhero films of all-time! You name it: X2, Spider-Man 1 & 2, Batman Begins, ""Daredevil"" is as good or better! In fact, it's my personal FAVORITE! If you haven't seen the Director's Cut do whatever you must to obtain a copy and see for yourself. I talked a friend of mine, who's in the comics business, into viewing the Director's Cut.",Daredevil

380,zipit,"Fun, action-packed and effects-filled",7,5 March 2003,"After the film I felt thoroughly entertained.   I must say that the person I went with disliked the film very much for plot and acting reasons.   I found the whole effect of the film to be very good indeed, keeping me gripped to the end and wanting more.   Acting is perhaps secondary to the superhero genre and, in this respect, this was no different.  That is not to say that the acting was bad and I felt that Jennifer Garner shone as the mega star that she will become.",Daredevil

I'm not acomic books expert or anything, but enjoy superheroes/adventurestories as much as anyone else, and I found this film to be veryenjoyable. Maybe it starts a little slow, but it picks up fairly quickly.Although I had some doubts about Ben Affleck, when I saw themovie was pleasantly surprised.I totally believed he wasDaredevil. Colin Farrell does one charismatic crazed villain, reallycool! Over the top and absolutely fun. Jennifer Garner did anexcellent job as the heroine/love interest. And since I'm a romancesucker I have to say that the part I liked the most was the love storyplot. These characters have a more human approach than say, inSpiderman, and with a darker feel. Good fun!",Daredevil
382,hamilton-3,Better than I expected...,7,2 August 2003,"While not at the level of Spider-Man, this flick is a solid interpretation of comic book heroism.  While the action looked cheesy in previews, it turns out to be quite effective in context.  Ben Affleck does a fine job of underplaying his character, providing just the nuance to offset the cartoonish context.",Daredevil
383,heyitsadam,Not As Bad As People Make It Out To Be...,7,13 February 2014,"I finally got around to watching this last night. After reading all the terrible reviews and the way Ben Affleck was roasted as the choice for Batman, my expectations were very, very low. I'll say this: the movie started off with a lot of promise... the origin story portion of the movie was well done. In a way, Matt Murdock almost reminds me of Dexter. But the movie fell apart when we were finally introduced to Colin Ferrell's Bullseye. As soon as he made his entrance on the screen, the viewer is bombarded with his endless mugging and facial twitches along with his pointless over-acting, so much to the point it took away from the rest of the movie and I just started making sarcastic cracks about him. Then I started thinking: has Colin Ferrell been in ANYTHING that was good? I scrolled through IMDb and he's been in mostly garbage. He's also responsible for destroying 2 beloved 80's films in remakes (Total Recall and Fright Night). The guy is literally the Kevorkian of movie material.In a nutshell, I thought Daredevil was pretty good. The costume was AWESOME. Kingpin, for such a ruthless, huge guy, barely left his office (which I didn't get). It's a shame because the movie, tweaked just a LIIIIIIIIIITLE bit could have been really good! But I'll say this: I'm not concerned with Ben Affleck as Batman anymore.",Daredevil
384,mssandlin,A Near Miss,7,19 February 2003,"I'm a big comics fan and a fan of comic book movies. (I even saw The Punisher twice.)  So naturally I was excited to see DD.  From the opening scenes, I thought that this film would rank right up there with Spiderman and X-Men, both of which I loved.  However in the end I was a little disappointed.  The story was good, Affleck was great as Matt Murdock and pretty good as Daredevil. M.C.D. was perfectly cast as the Kingpin, and Colin Farrell, who I usually hate, was the best thing in the movie.  I loved the combination of humor (especially the mustard in the coffee bit) and dark imagery (the kid crying while Affleck assures him ""I'm not the bad guy"").  The struggle at the heart of this movie is real and  socially relevant which is more than can be said for lots of comic movies (like the last three Batman flicks). Special effects were subtle and well done for the most part, and each of the characters looked almost perfect for the part.  The ""radar"" scenes were especially good, and M.C.D. was so great that I completely forgot the Kingpin I read in the comics was a different color than him.  And possibly my favorite thing about this movie, when Murdock is on the roof with Electra and he hears the crime below, HE DOESN'T GO FIGHT IT!!  What a great twist of realism and surprise.  What a powerful way to make the characters into real people.  All of this brings me to the point where I could almost say that this is a great movie. . . almost.Visuals, which for the most part are stunning, suddenly fall apart in the big fight scene on top of the pipe organ.  This was some of the worst effects work I've seen in recent years.  It felt like I was suddenly watching a video game. The love story, while touching with the repeated line ""Stay with me"", feels a little forced.  The movie was 15 min. short of the two hour mark, and a little added footage between the Electra and Murdock would've been a good idea. The Kingpin was another character who would have benefitted from more screen-time.  We're intrigued by the character, but we never understand how he runs a criminal organization or even what he really does.  His ""Nobody is innocent"" line is wonderful, but show us why he feels that way. Additionally, we never find out how the cops know that Fisk is the Kingpin. DD just says so and we're stuck taking his word for it.  Who told the cops? What proof do they have?  This would have been an interesting side story. These were problems, but the lowpoint of this film is the aforementioned fight scene, not only because of its poor visuals, but also because it shouldn't have happened.  The man (DD) had lost enough blood to stain half of a Cathedral and could barely move when the priest finds him, and then, ten seconds later, he's flipping through the air and taking punches without missing a beat.  This is the classic goof of action/superhero movies.  They beat him up to build the tension and then, once they've got you worried about him, ""Don't worry folks it's all okay"" and he's kicking butt and taking names again.  Either don't hurt him in the first place or give him some time to recover.  Bullseye is tough enough to have a good fight with an uninjured DD, and so is the Kingpin.  Daredevil is a good movie, it's worth the full price ticket, but it falls short of greatness due to a few bad scenes and fuzzy writing.

385,Eyesore_is_cool,Wow.,1,14 April 2007,"All I can say is that I'm glad to have been alive to see the worst movie ever made. The fact that this cinematic monstrosity isn't in the bottom 100 is outrageous, God, where do I start with this pile? First of all the soundtrack was unbearable, I do not want to hear bad music when I'm watching a film, just because it's perceivably heavy, angsty garbage doesn't mean it fits an action scene; I'm talking about Evanescence here. I suppose if you like Evanescence this comment is irrelevant because you're probably too stupid to discern a bad movie from a good one anyway...Secondly the acting was atrocious at best, I feel so bad for Joey Pants for having to be a part of that shitstorm. Ben Affleck is bad, Collin Farrel is bad, nearly everyone in this movie is a humungously bad actor; And no, a bad script does not justify terrible acting because a good actor should be able to rise above the material.Thirdly the script was full of awful lines, plot holes, and completely unexplained events... I don't need to go on. This is wholly unmemorable garbage and no, I will not see the director's cut/extended edition/whatever just because this one sucked a big one. Bad/10",Daredevil

390,the_shah,Spider man was better...,4,15 February 2003,"Spoiler Well, another Marvel comic book has come to life.  This time, worse than ever.  I was actually really looking forward to seeing this film when I saw the trailers, but I now see that it was an utter waste of time and money.Its one of those films that you rent when it comes to video and never think of again.The plot was crummy.  Sure one gets interested with the nuclear waste (which happens to be a big part of many marvel comic books).  His senses are enhanced (memories of Spider man?).  After that, all goes downhill.The costumes were interesting.  Especially the ones that Jennifer Garner wore.  I was pleased.  Other than that, they sucked.  Bullseye, upon requesting a costume from the Kingpin (the only humorous part of the movie), changed into something that was so subtly different from his original ""costume"", that it didn't make a difference whatsoever.  Pity he didn't stick with his comic book costume (tight white leather with a pointless utility belt).  Ben Affleck wore a tight maroon leather costume.  It looked rather foolish I must say.  My big question is, why the heck are all the characters so homosexual.  Spiderman wore a spandex costume, Batman, an odd plastic covering, Superman, also spandex... And now daredevil, tight leather.  Okay, aerodynamics are cited as the reason, but why not at least wear capes that cover things?  They're creepy.  And why in Spider-man did they contract their names, such as ""Gobby"" for the green goblin, and Spidey for Spider-man?  What next?  Devily, Batty, Soupy?  What utter stupidity.Perhaps the three things were a benefit to the film were Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner and Michael Clarke Duncan were the only assets, maybe even Colin Farrel.  The acting was okay, but the characters were properly chosen. Affleck played blind quite well I must say.  Mr. Duncan, the Kingpin, though he was supposed to be white, adapted the role very well.  Pity Jennifer Garner died so soon into the movie.  She was hot.  Colin Farrel was okay.  Not so great, not too bad.  His ability was cool though.  Using anything as a projectile was funky.  Other than that, everything sucked.Thats about it.But at least we know there will be a sequel that maybe they will do a better job on.  But maybe not...",Daredevil
391,xxxneon,Garner + some decent action overcome Daredevil's recklessness and the numerous faux pas - barely.,6,23 February 2003,"(some spoilers)If you're a systems analyst like me, I hope you're addicted to Daredevil comic books or have a severe crush on Jennifer Garner. Otherwise you're gonna be in for some major disappointment in this one. If you're not a systems analyst, you'll probably like it.Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) was blinded by toxic waste as a child, which immensely heightened his remaining senses. He's now a mild-mannered defence attorney, possibly as breathtaking to female audience members as Elektra Natchios (Garner) was to me.OK. As Matt's boxer dad would say, now the gloves come off. I truly lost count of all the credibility gaps, stereotypes and continuity faux pas. This film is a textbook example of what horror writer Tom Monteleone calls an idiot plot-if everyone didn't act like idiots, there wouldn't BE a plot.To wit: after he loses a rape case, Matt exacts his own revenge on the perp. But he starts this in a crowded club, killing several total strangers, while the bad guy gets away! He catches up with him later and kills him. Guilt by association and don't worry about the punishment fitting the crime-what a nice lesson for young people.The villain (the Kingpin) and his yes-man give performances as deep as comic book paper. We never learn what Elektra does for a living, other than practice martial arts and prance around like your typical atypical billionaire's daughter. Her dad, who works for the Kingpin, wants out. Yeah sure, pal. At a fancy party, Kingpin basically tells the guy he's going to kill him; then when he leaves in a limo, he takes NO evasive action whatsoever. Duh! Could someone please tell me why the driver and another guy in the front seat (who are obviously Kingpin's employees) are killed also? Thought not. Then Elektra inexplicably removes the murder weapon from her dad's chest before making sure he's dead (something even first-year ER viewers know not to do) and despite abundant evidence to the contrary, thinks Daredevil killed her father!Had enough? No wait-it gets worse. The director must've had a fixation about full moons. Even though the action takes place over several weeks, it's ALWAYS a full moon. Uh huh. That it rains a lot is fine. That Elektra is the first woman Daredevil has taken to the rooftop whose views he loved as a child is fine. That in the middle of a thunderstorm, she expresses amazement that he sensed it was about to start raining ISN'T. He hears the words ""Kingpin"" and ""gun"" from the street below and says he has to go help. Elektra pleads with him to stay. I confess I'D rather go inside and have sex with Jennifer Garner than fight crime, but I don't think Daredevil should shirk his duties in such a fashion.Quiz time: why is a murder weapon in the morgue and not a police evidence locker? Why is a dagger bloody when pulled out of one person but not when pulled out of another? Heightened senses are one thing, but how does Daredevil recover in a matter of minutes from being stabbed though the heart? On a related note, why is it that in scenes later that night, his suit doesn't have a hole in it? And why does Daredevil say he's been waiting years to deal out justice to the Kingpin, when it was some OTHER kingpin who had his father killed? By the way, if the Daredevil is so interested in helping the little guy, why is he so wanton about property damage?Some friendly advice to the players: Ben, read the script next time. And Jen, don't quit your day job. I was far more interested in the CREDIBLE performances of Colin Farrell as Bullseye the hitman and Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urich the reporter.Overall, the pluses slightly outweigh the minuses. The stunts are good (though not spectacular) and the visual and sound effects are top-notch. The pacing is decent and the obligatory material on Daredevil's genesis is handled well. But some of the ""action"" sequences were downright boring. And then there's the avenge this, revenge that and never mind how many innocent people get hurt ""plot."" How original. And is it just me or does having Garner wear EXCLUSIVELY outfits that show off her cleavage come off as gratuitous? Even a bad episode of Alias is more interesting than this fare.

Its understandable to me why Marvel wanted to capitalize on Spiderman's success and continue bringing comic book characters to the big screen.  I hope that X-men2 and Incredible Hulk turn out alot better than this movie. Daredevil can be described as a bunch of jig-saw puzzle pieces thrown in a box and tossed around.  Let me give you a overview of what was going on inside my head at different points of this movie: After 10 Minutes:  ""This kind of looks interesting"" After 30 Minutes:  After re-adjusting myself in my seat a couple times, ""Maybe it is just starting slow, I really hope this gets better!"" After 1 Hour:  ""I can't believe I am still sitting here!"" After 90 Minutes:  ""I would walk out now, but just for kicks and giggles I'll stick around."" After Movie mercifully ends:  ""I just lost a considerable degree of intelligence for having to sit through that movie""In fact folks, the only fun part about this movie was making fun of how horrible bad it was.  Seriously, I am not at all a tough movie critic. But I think I have to go back now to all the stupid movies I have seen before and give them one or more points onto their score, just to move them above this movie in rating.  Thats how bad it was.

395,daveshubcaps,Enjoyable comic book action fun,7,16 February 2003,"Not a bad way to spend a few bucks on a movie. While not as good as Spider-Man or Superman, Daredevil has a leg up on most of the Batman movies.Like Spider-Man, this movie has a comic-book feel to it, but in Daredevil it comes through more in the acting than in the visuals. Ben Affleck does a good turn as the ""Guardian Devil"", it's probably the first movie I've seen of his where he wasn't playing ""Ben Affleck"". In other words, I could believe him as Matt Murdock. Jennifer Garner was absolutely stunning as Electra (I can't say I was pleased with what happens to her character) both in beauty and in fighting ability. the initial fight scene between Murdock and Electra is outstanding.Colin Farrell as Bullseye. Oh BOY! Talk about your over the top, cheez-whiz, scenery-chewing, William Shatner school of acting, bad guy! Absolutely delicious! Here is where you are reminded that what you are watching is a movie made from a comic book. Look for this lovely little line spoken by him, ""I missed! I NEVER miss!"". Speaking of Bullseye, don't leave the theater immediately when the credits start rolling, there's a little suprise!Michael Clarke Duncan was excellent as Kingpin. There is no man on this planet I can think of who looks more menacing even when smiling than the towering statue that is Duncan. Jon Favreau provides good comedic relief as Fopggy Nelson, Joe Pantiliano was so forgettable as his character, I can't even remember the character's name.Viusuals were impressive, though the movie is a little too dark to really see the action. What I liked the most was the rendering of how Murdock ""sees"" using his sense of sound.The story itself has it's ups and downs, but overall it was a good trip to the movie theater.7/10",Daredevil
396,realhiphop,director's cut- do yourself a favor. See it,9,16 January 2005,"First of all, i was never a reader of the comics, and didn't know much about daredevil before venturing into the cinemas to see the original when it was released. At the time, there wasn't much action out and i like most of Ben Affleck's movies, so though i would give it a go. Although i liked the theatrical release ( but didn't love it) i still bought it when it came to DVD...and to be honest, when i watched it the 2nd time on DVD, i didn't think as much of it, as when i left the cinema.So when i heard the directors cut was out, and people who hated the first release, but liked the 2nd one, i thought wow, i didn't mind the first, perhaps i will really like the new version. and guess what? I did ! Its absolutely fantastic. After the characters were fleshed out more, the storyline was more involved and filled in the plots- you actually cared about what happened and got more into the feel of being apart of what was going on in hell's kitchen.If you watch the ""featurette"" : giving the devil his dues, you will understand that Mark Johnson the director, absolutely loves this material, loved the comic, and was disappointed himself with the theatrical release. He understood why the critics & fans alike didn't support it, and really wanted to fix the problems with this DVD. When will Hollywood studios & executives learn, a 100 minute movie, does not mean a better movie - and when will they learn that audiences DO want more than just action - we can think, you morons! And can hold our attention for more than 100 minutes. Here's a simple plan for your money making schemes - and this goes to Gary Foster ( producer who still says the theatrical version of daredevil is better) If you make a GOOD MOVIE, that gets good reviews, and that fans & critics enjoy, then more people will see it, more people will see it a 2nd time, more people will recommend it to friends, and that means a bigger audience, a repeat audience and bigger dollars for your pockets ! So while the first was a quick paced movie that made quick bucks, a longer - more thought-out MOVIE, would have garnered longer life at the box office.in a word - RECOMMENDED !",Daredevil

I think that I went into this movie to expect something like Spiderman... Well you dont get that!   Spoilers ahead, not that you should see this POS anyway.  Its so depressing!    Mostly because it starts out with the Daredevil dieing.   Then shows how his dad dies, and then oh he find Jennifer Garner (yay!)  Bullseye shows up (yay!!!!!  Colin Farrel oh yes!) And, then Jennifer's dad dies, and then Bullseye kills Jennifer and dude the rest is depressing.    Daredevil doesnt die, but to me you sit there for 90 minutes, even though it seems like its been about 3 hours, and you have no sympathy for this guy because he's a wuss!!!   There are a few reasons I really dislike this movie.   One being its utterly depressing.   Two, dude Jennifer Garner gets knocked off?!  What the hell!!!   Three Ben Affleck had 14, yeah 14, stunt doubles for this movie, hmmm  who thinks he's a tad wussy?   Four Colin Farrel is bald.  I got past him being the bad guy and the bullseye in the middle of this head, but the bald thing so doesnt work for him!   Five not enough Michael Clark Duncan.   Duncan is so cool and yet there isnt enough of him in it!!!  Six not enough Joe Pantilinio (or as I refer to him Joey Pants).   Dude this guy is in the movie and it so styling and yet like he has no time in the movie!   Seven and last - Ben Afflack, okay this guy in this movie is so pathetic you wish and pray that we will just die!!!   Not to mention that he so ugly in this movie and that his Daredevil costume looks like ewe!  on him.   To give something postive about the piece of crap Im talking about.   Good cast it really was, Ben Affleck, Michael Clark Duncan, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrel, and of course Joey Pants.   It was a big waste of talent... It really was...    The stunts that Jennifer did were good, and the fights were good.   But that so doesnt make up for the over all s****iness of this movie!   So my over all grade is a 1/10 1 being the worst!

As I read from other reviews, the theatrical cut is supposedly much worse than the directors cut so keep that in mind.The protagonist is played by Ben Affleck and the antagonist is played by Michael Clarke Duncan, both phenomenal actors. Sadly their acting falls flat due to ridiculous dialogue, editing, goofy VFX and pacing. The movie just has an overall wacky vibe.It feels like the family friendly, over the top superhero movie that it is. The more recent Daredevil series managed to set the tone much better.All in all it is pretty bad, maybe I recommend it for people who want to watch something wacky pr goofy, not much more than that though.",Daredevil
400,mchl_dao,Daredevil,9,28 February 2003,"This movie is worth watching. My advice is if you didn't have the chance to see this movie, you gotta see it right now. For those people who really love comic book, this is a must see movie becuz Ben Affleck had done a great job and so does the rest of the cast........ 10 out of 10",Daredevil
401,suntorytime10,Simon Birch u say?!,3,14 February 2003,"Well, another day, another superhero flick lights up the luminous signs at the local pictures. Unlike most superhero films I've enjoyed over the years, Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" to name two, I didn't have particularly high hopes for this flick directed by the guy who gave us ""Simon Birch"" (anyone remember that?) and the loverboy who starred in the epic Pearl Harbor, oh the humanity of that one! So Daredevil is the newest comic incarnation, and it's not exactly worth waiting for. Affleck plays the titular character, Matt Murdock lawyer by day, who, after a horrendous accident becomes blind, only to see his other senses have superhero potency. After then regaining the confidence in his self (""The Boy without fear"" no less"") sees his boxer father murdered before his very eyes, and, as an adult lawyer, becomes Daredevil. Nothing new really. That's one of the things that Daredevil lacks in drodes: originality. The ability to tell a fresh, innovative story in a film market already saturated with numerous superhero incarnations. It steals and jigs about the things that made films like ""Spider-Man"" and ""The Matrix"" so original and compelling viewing. Throughout the film you can see director Johnson's love for the subject, but far too many times during did I get the sense of overindulgence and overkeeness in the directors approach, although at times his visualisation of the material is impressive. The story to drifts in the pantomine-esque bumblings of ""Spawn"", never really capturing the audience as it so hopes to. All credit to Affleck though, his performance is one of grace and depth, playing both the blind lawyer and superhero with style, using his boyish charisma to great effect. Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin is also excellent, menacing and strong, even if criminally under-used, and Jennifer Garner passes the ""babe"" level, but doesn't really get to stretch herself in a pretty flat and hollow role. Colin Farrell remains totally overrated in my book after his awkward, and sometimes laughable portrayal as Irish hitman Bullseye, who would have made a good living if he was a villain in the 70's Batman TV series, he's that bad. The supporting cast are excellent though, with Joe Patoliano as dependable as ever, and Jon Favreau adds some much needed comedic touches. But these two can't help as the film moves quickly, and loudly, through one run-of-the-mill action set piece after the other. Sorry to all those comic book fans who can't wait to see it, but in my opinion, Daredevil is unevenly scripted, plainly directed, empty and above all, dull. but, expect a bumper opening weekend and a sequel in 2-3 years! D'oh!",Daredevil
402,Evac156,Much ado about not a heck of a lot,4,2 August 2003,"There's really not much to it. Some of the action scenes are pretty good, and the first confrontation between Murdock and Elektra is fun to watch, but that's about it. The story is superficial and predictable. Colin Farrell is entertaining as Bullseye; I can see why he's been getting so much work lately (Farrell, that is -- not Bullseye), but his over-the-top psycho bit can't compensate for Affleck's deadpan Daredevil.I was never a fan of the Daredevil comic. Why? Well, what makes superheroes interesting? Easy -- superPOWERS. Daredevil doesn't have them, and hence the movie doesn't have the flash and dazzle that make X-Men and Spider-Man so appealing (I won't compare it to the Hulk, since I couldn't be bothered to see that one).With neither an involving story nor a big bucket of eye-candy (Jennifer Garner's stunning cleavage notwithstanding), there isn't a heck of a lot to recommend Daredevil.",Daredevil
403,Justin-MacLean,The Devil Dared Me!,10,19 February 2003,"Daredevil is a comic book series from Marvel Comics.  Looks like Marvel Comics (again) is going to hear the sound of the cash register, because this movie was EXCELLENT!Though I have to admit I had my doubts.  Especially for when I already know about Daredevil and the setting.Having a Black Kingpin, for in the comics the Kingpin is White!?!? Also, the character Elektra in the comics is Greek, not White!?! Finally, having the villian Bullseye, with no custome!?!?However through out the course, I could not envision a better Kingpin than Michael Clarke Cuncan.I ended up liking the Scar on Bullseye head better, than the ""Comic Book"" costume.A truly must see movie.If you thought Jack Nicolson was good as the ""Joker"" then I DARE you go see Daredevil and tell me that Colin Farrel as Bullseye was as good, if not better!",Daredevil
404,Rett_Mikhal,It's better than Spider-man!,10,2 March 2003,"Dark, desperate, heroic, mysterious, awesome, kick-ass!! One amazing movie right here, it's a true dark setting and it gets right to the point: Kick-ass action and, surprisingly, acting. Ben Whofleck actually acts good! And all the other characters are right on. Some people may hate Micheal Clark Duncan for taking the Kingpin role, but once the end fight scene comes you know it's right. It also pulls off the right scene cut here, camera change here, zoom there to look like a real comic book. And without the rather awkard moments of Spider-man, but it does lack a little enemy-good-guy rivally and dialouge that Spider-man had with Spidey and the Goblin.Kick-ass!",Daredevil
405,ehawke-1,Great Special Effects; Fair Acting,7,3 April 2004,"Special effects?  You got it!  Some great fight scenes?  Yup!  The acting isn't the greatest, but the plot's not half bad and the dialogue is adequate.  The best part of this movie is Colin Farrell.  He's quite ""over the top"" as Bullseye; very funny too - in a sick, twisted way.  Jennifer Garner brings a bit of spark to her role as Electra Natchios, and obviously trained hard for the role.  I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck whatsoever!  In fact, I can't stand his acting per se, but he was alright in this movie. Michael Clark Duncan is good, as is Jon Favreau as Ben Affleck's lawyer partner.  It's a movie worth renting, but it's certainly not one I would go out and buy to watch again and again.",Daredevil
406,KryptoniteCornCob,"Forget the theatrical version, buy the director's cut DVD instead!",9,1 December 2004,"This review is for the Director's cut DVD of Daredevil. In all honesty, i liked the theatrical version of this movie. But now that i have seen the true version of this movie, the director's cut, i don't have any desire to watch the theatrical cut ever again. The director's cut is an improvement in every way. Everything makes sense now, and the characters are more fleshed out, which is a very good thing. The DC is 30 minutes longer than the original cut, of which the new footage ranges from a whole new big subplot, and little things, that actually have more impact and and make the movie more understandable and better than you might imagine. The action scenes are way better also. The DC makes the movie into what it should've been in the first place before the studio screwed with it. I can't believe how much the studio hacked this movie up for theater..it is quite ridiculous. But now with the movie restored to it's original vision, i can fully enjoy it without the thought of something missing from it. In comparison, the only thing that the original DVD release has over this new DC DVD is it has a second bonus features/behind the scenes disc. The DC DVD is one disc, and has a few movie trailers, a making-of featurette, and an all new audio commentary. Despite it's shortcomings in form of a second disc compared to it's counterpart, i'd choose the DC over the theatrical version any day. The DC is simply so much better. Forget what you know about the theatrical cut of the movie, and give this new DC version a chance..it is superior to the other version in every way. So give it a try, and i think you might be pleasantly surprised. Even those of you who hate the original cut. My vote, in comparison: Theatrical version- 5.5 Director's cut version- 9.5In closing, i'd like to thank the Director, the film editors, and everyone else who made this wonderful Director's cut DVD possible. I love the new version, and it's nice to see the Director's vision restored to this movie after nearly 1 1/2 years. Two thumbs up! R.I.P. Daredevil theatrical version!!",Daredevil
407,taito2000,Didn't see the original,10,27 March 2021,This version is absolutely incredible. Went into it not having an opinion about the original. But I absolutely loved it. I was totally satisfied with it.,Daredevil
408,dashaunfolife,DareDevil underrated,8,24 August 2014,"Now a days this film has been getting very negative reviews but when it came out people loved it it got mixed review and all but so does a lot of movies. In this review I will be talking about the directors cut and the theatrical cut of the film. Daredevil theatrical cuts plot is Matt Murdock/ Daredevil fights bullseye and kingpin and elektra is the love interest who is the second main character but it has a lot of great visual design and lots of touches that comic book fans can enjoy I read comics and I found more comic book characters and nuances to the comics than that of the criminally overrated film dark knight. Now the plot for daredevil directors cut is Matt Murdock is taking the case for a drug dealer who has been framed for murder and the subplot is the elektra story ark and they're more nuances to the comics in this film more than the theatrical cut and I loved all the stuff taken from miller, smith, and bendis's daredevil comics with little touches of lees and romitas work on early dd comics. Overall 10 out of 10 for both film check these out you'll love them.",Daredevil
409,justinericmaclean,True Believer,10,11 March 2006,"This is without a doubt one of Marvel's best movie to date. Seriously, I don't know what people's problem is? The movie (to date, other than ""Sin City"") is pretty faithful to the Comics. Where as Spider-Man, all of the sudden, the sense of humor is gone and he develops webs shooting from his wrists, oppose to Peter Parker inventing Webshooters. Or how the X-Men uniforms are much different than the ones in the comics, but to complain on that one would just be silly. I'm not try to bash Spider-Man nor X-Men, but I would say the Prime audience are those who collect or collected comics books, or were a fan of the animated shows. Collin Farrel I feel is the all time greatest portrayal of a Villain (Bullseye). Even of Jack Nicholson's Joker.The only crime is that it looks like there'll be no sequel.If there's any sequel I'd most like to see done, it's Daredevil.",Daredevil
410,VaneWimsey,Just Doesn't Work,3,30 January 2005,"This movie sacrifices substance for style every time. Thus, it is repeatedly stupid and nonsensical. Yes, I know, it's a comic book, but while a comic book may start with a few unrealistic premises, it should make sense within that self-imposed framework. Daredevil doesn't.I mean, would even bullies challenge a blind kid to fight? When Matt walks all the way through a restaurant to ask Elektra for some honey, wouldn't she wonder how he knew she -- and the honey -- were there? If Daredevil can perceive bullets coming at him well enough to dodge them, how come he needs it to rain before he can see Elektra's face? I can accept that Daredevil can ""see"" flagpoles and window-cleaning platforms well enough to work his way down from a roof using them, but if he falls 100 feet and then catches a flagpole, his arms should rip off.Oh, yeah, and how long does it take Elektra to clean up all the spilled sand in her apartment after her workout?",Daredevil
411,DaveKerr,"Watch It, And Pay Attention!",10,13 February 2003,"Okay, first of all; I'll be honest. I'm a huge fan of the Daredevil comics, and perhaps that's influenced my view of this film. But anyway; here goes: Daredevil is a character from the Marvel comics universe. Lawyer by day as Matt Murdock, vigilante by night. Oh, and he's blind too; but don't discriminate on that fact. Converting such an obscure and complicated character is not an easy task; but it's been done to great effect in this case. The characters are, for the most part, well developed and interesting. The look of the film is very gritty and conveys the mood of Hell's Kitchen (a deprived area of New York) brilliantly. So far, the reviews I've read have been quite a downer; saying how it's not like Spider-Man, or there's no plot, just action. However, if you pay attention to this piece of film you can see how there's plenty of depth. Daredevil/Matt is a tortured soul but he tries to not let despair consume him; he fights back and he is a man with faith. This film takes you on his emotional journey and, at the end of it all, you feel very satisfied. Affleck, a choice for DD that I was unsure of, shines in his role; as does Jennifer Garner as his loved interest: Elektra. This isn't just a fanboy flick, it's not just a film for guys. This is a great piece of cinema that can appeal to various groups of people. There's humour (mainly from Jon Favreau as Foggy Nelson, and Colin Farrell as the Irish assassin 'Bullseye'), romance, drama and action all in an interesting mixture that works superbly. I won't rant on about the plot, because I think that's something that you should discover for yourself. Admittedly, they've had to change certain elements and so it sometimes deviates from the comic but they're never unnecessary changes; they help move the film along and make it work in that particular medium. And, as someone who's loved the comic for several years, I don't find any of these changes offensive. But please, when you watch it. PAY ATTENTION and go in with an open mind, oh, and make sure you sit through the end credits for a nice reward. Dave's Rating ***** out of *****",Daredevil
412,bigmike-4,Good.. not great..,7,14 February 2003,"Let me preface my review by stating that the movie lived up to my modest expectations. Many, however, might be let down after recent successes as X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002).The overall plot is set up well enough, with the story prefaced by how Matt Murdock was blinded and eventually became the DareDevil. Sequences throughout the film which depict how he is able to ""see"" even though he is blind are wicked cool and do a lot to make his ""super senses"" believable.
There are, of course, some massive plot holes, such as how he managed to leap tall buildings in a single bound, a la Superman. But if you keep in mind that this is a comic book world we're talking about, you'll quickly realize that the rules of the ""real world"" don't apply. If you can remember this, you'll enjoy the experience a whole lot more.The production values are certainly solid, with lots of great fight sequences, good CG work, stellar sound (this film is an audiophiles wet-dream, IMO), and a passable plot. All these things, however, do not quite add up in the end.They seem to try to portray DareDevil as some sort of reluctant hero. However he often times seems way to human, then you see him doing very superhuman stunts. This is probably the biggest fault of the film and will undoubtely be a chief complaint among all but the hardest of hardcore fans.The acting is pretty good and there are lots of familiar faces in the supporting cast. In terms of Affleck's character, I left feeling rather numb, not caring too much about him one way or another. Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin was a good choice, though he isn't given much to do here other than look intimidating. They also managed to waste the talents of Jennifer Garner. She just doesn't get enough screen time and very little effort is spent fleshing out her character. However, I am happy to say that Colin Farrell plays the coolest villian since Lex Luthor. He'll probably be the one thing you end up remembering most after walking out of the theatre.About my only other chief complaint is that some of the editing and camerawork falls into a trap we're seeing all too much lately: shots that are WAY too tight coupled with cuts that are so fast they could possibly cause a seizure. We saw some of this in the two latest installments of Star Wars and in other films such as Armageddon. Why editors and directors continue to do this is beyond me, as it spoils the impact of some fight scenes.Overall, DareDevil is a solid comicbook-to-screen transition. It's not nearly are spirited or memorable as X-Men or Spider-Man, though it is an enjoyable night at the movies. Just remember to check your brain at the door...",Daredevil
413,moviefan-35,Disappointing,3,19 February 2003,"I didn't think this movie was going to be any good when I showed up at the theater.  I got what I was expecting.  One thing I'd like to point out is if they are going to start trying to film American movies like the Hong Kong action films, they need to get cinematographers from Hong Kong.  Someone needs to be able to compensate for the American director's inability to shoot fight scenes.  The fight scenes in this movie were terrible.  They were too dark and murky and the camera work was horrible.  They need to put a stop to trying to shoot action films like this until they can find directors who know how to set them up and film them.",Daredevil
414,mab22386,I dare you to give a crap about this film...,1,15 February 2003,"Well this was disappointing. This is my prime example of a movie that dosn't know what it wants to be. It starts off Dark and Gritty and then it all oh the sudden switchs to light hearted. This movie goes everywhere in that sense it switches to fast and to quick from Dark to Sad to Light. This creates a sense of unbalance to the movie. As for the blind laywer character DareDevil, well he just flat out is the worst superhero of our time. He has good intentions but he always does the wrong thing. He is killing people left and right, most of these people are people he failed to win a case against in court, what the hell!. The love interest Jennifer Garner (so damn hot) is probley the most rounded character, although her backround on the fighting skills is quite stupid. Kingpin was great, I mean you got the great Duncan playing him. Kingpin was just so bad ass, especially the fight at the end with Daredevil. Now as for Bullseye, I don't know what to say, I mean he was a cool character, but the horribly messy fight scene at the end was so bad it makes me want to hate the character. Then again, I think I would kill myself for not liking any disgruntled Irishman. Now for the things I liked. The fight scenes were for the most part awesome, I mean the high jumping and the kicking and the stabing (while very far fetched were still good). I mean the fight scene against Kingpin and DareDevil was so awesome. The way Daredevil saw things, he sees through sound vibrations and its pretty much a blue mist that covers everything and gives him a rough image of the room. I mean that was the coolest thing in the movie. Ayway this movie was Ok, thats really it. I mean if your looking for a slightly entertaining unbalanced action, well than this is it.GRADE: CI thought I might add something my friend said ""This is truly a love or hate it movie"".",Daredevil
415,xer0derm,Not Again,4,17 February 2003,"I'm not too sure I understand this genre and why it is doing so well in the boxoffice.  While performances were quite stellar by the big actors, the roles themselves were quite weak.  Along with Spiderman, there's a weak storyline in which we are asked to join along in and join with the ""superhero"" as he captures the girl of his dreams, overcomes his troubled childhood, becomes a great power in a corrupt city, and ultimatley comes close to death.  Why should I watch this movie.  The CGI is rediculous, and the plot is just plain stupid.  I understand thats how the comic was written, and it was great seeing Kevin Smith make a cameo, along with special tributes to authors and drawers of comics.  However, this movie should never have been released to the public, and the amount of money it is making is representative of how much people do not understand a good movie. Hollywood is killing itself, and dragging us all down with it.  Stick to the nice independent films.  Great job by the actors themselves.",Daredevil
416,rafajs77,One of the worst movies in history!,1,3 June 2006,"I am a fan of the genre, made it a point to catch ""Batman"" movies, ""X-Men,"" ""Spiderman,"" etc. etc. This movie, however, is horrible. The plot is thin, the characters are ridiculous, the special effects are insulting (not in their execution, but in the way that special effects for ""Chalie's Angels: Full Throttle"" were insulting), and the acting is bad. Perhaps the only exception as far as acting is concerned is Ben Affleck. Yes, I can't believe that I am saying this either, but Ben Affleck is actually good, but not good enough to save this train-wreck of a film.I read a fellow reviewer's comments, saying that one should watch the Director's Cut, because it adds 30 minutes which make the rest of the film ""make more sense."" No disrespect, but I can't imagine a more terrible fate than to watch 30 extra minutes of this movie. The movie didn't need to make sense, it made enough sense, it was just bad.The part where Colin Farrell (Bullseye) faces off against Ben Afflleck (Daredevil) by breaking glass gymnast-style then catching the falling shards one by one and shooting them at the hero like ninja-stars...wow, what can one say about a scene like that without descending into inappropriate language? Perhaps only: ""highly unlikely.""To top it off, the movie ends with the slaughter of a fly via a finger-flicked scalpel by a paralyzed and fully bandaged Bullseye. He then says ""bullseye!"" in self-appreciation of his kill...roll credits! I want my money back, I want my time back!",Daredevil
417,raiden1969,"Wait for the video, and rent it.",3,14 February 2003,"Don't worry - no spoilers. Had the opportunity to screen this and first, let me clarify - I'm a huge fan of the comic.  The weak link in the movie is Affleck.  He's simply not a leading man.  He is strong when he plays the yuppie in love, but he is not the dark psyched Daredevil.  He does a really poor job and just adds no edge to the character.  He is supported by the lovely Garner who is adequate as Electra.  Colin Farrell steals the show as Bullseye and does an excellent job.  Affleck should focus on romantic comedies and leave the action flicks to the big boys.",Daredevil
418,njaguar71,Stick to cartoons.,5,28 September 2008,"I had low hopes for this film, so I wasn't disappointed. The casting of the Kingpin made me sad. Not to sound racist, but the kingpin is supposed to be a white guy. The fact they even used the Kingpin made me sadder because he can't be used for the Spiderman movies now (due to copyright issues). He is a central figure for Spiderman...why waste him on this movie? I'm surprised they used Ben Afleck here. I don't really like his acting, but the fact he has a mole on his cheek (visible in the costume as well as in a tux) kinda ruins it. The fight scenes and the overall dialog are pretty cheesy. Only Nolan could have saved this film.On the upside, Jennifer Garner is hot. Great choice picking her.Overall, I think Batman should be the only DC live-action movie. Hulk, Spiderman, Xmen, and the rest just get brought down using real actors. They need to make a high budget animated film instead. They need to these movies darker and less family-friendly. I think that's why the Batman movies were such a hit.",Daredevil

This film is just one horrible cliche after another with corny lines and wooden acting abound, I swear to you if I see Ben Afflick on the street I'm going to demand my money back from him for this lame ass movie. We knew we were in trouble when about five minutes into the movie the kid and the dad start crying in each other arms, and is there a more believable multi-billionare than that big guy who when he gets threatened turns it into a ""Brooklyn thing"" and despite his incredible resources he'll fight Daredevil himself. I swear to god, I think one scene was lifted directly out of the Matrix, line for line, action for action. It got so bad that by about the 15th minute we were just laughing at how horrible this film was and cracking jokes about Nachos. The movie would have been a flawless comedy if only we all knew but hoped Daredevil didn't fight Kingpin after killing Bullseye because we wanted to get the hell out of theater as un-hurt as possible but alas it didn't happen but I guess we wouldn't get the ""thug"" element if he didn't. Unless you want to laugh your ass off two hours at such a horrible movie, I suggest you don't see this. However, this could be the best comedy of the year, kicking ""How to lose a guy in 10 days"" right in the ass. Also another example of my theory that there is nothing valid in mainstream cinema today and Ben Afflick is cinematic poison. Seriously in six months when the hype wears off for this movie no one will care or like this film anymore.",Daredevil
421,Caitlin-Em,Trite,5,16 February 2003,"This movie is exactly what I expected it to be. I was waiting for it to end thirty minutes into the story, though in all fairness there were a few alright parts I didn't mind focusing on the screen for (other times I was studying the designs of the theatre or twirling the straw of my drink around). Colin Farrell I thought was the only character whose part didn't seem forced into the script (the romance between Matthew and Elektra Natchios--by the way, what the hell kind of name is that--I thought was a little thrusted together, as if they fell for each other too fast...I got a very juvenile feeling from their relationship, as if I was watching Hollywood produced eye candy for Spiderman junkies--oh wait, I was. Colin at least seemed both scary and endearing; not washed over several times into another stale archetype. The whole obsessing with justice idea seems very hokey and trite; so many superheroes care for nothing more than peace on the streets, hopefully leading to peace on earth.... But the futility of that idea is why I like things like the Crow; at least that character wasn't blinded (no pun on Affleck's part intended) by a rather impossible notion and only sought vengeance on behalf of very bad deeds by villains that still managed to keep that whole comic book flare. Daredevil tried way too hard; it was a good idea at first, and it seemed like it was aimed at a younger audience, but some of the death scenes were much too graphic, all in all leading me to believe this was a poor attempt at cashing in on the superhero craze.5 out of 10 stars for acting the best they could with a script extremely lacking in substance and appeal. I would have enjoyed it much more if I was a twelve year old boy.",Daredevil

It may not have been as superb as Spider-Man, but it is definitely up there and you can almost sympathize for the characters.

I know enough about the characters and basic story to know whats going on and where it's going. Some have complained that Affkeck and the tone of DD is too mediocre. Well there is nothing wrong with that. But I honestsly see DD as far more than that. It shows the downside of trying to protect and justify what has been wronged.

Notice how fake many of the jumping / throwing / falling scenes look.  All so bad they were good.The one major positive that comes from this movie is learning that Jennifer Garner has a terrific screen presence.  Too bad it was wasted on such a silly, boring movie (with occasional moments of fun).Farrell finally delivers on his chosen one status.

The sparky scenes between DD and Elektra were spot on, and the movie was full of touching moments, like when his pal sees Elektra in her dress at the party and says he wishes he could loan Matt his eyes so he could see her too. And when Bullseye stabbed Elektra and she died in Matt's arms, I was really moved.There were lots of really quirky bits too, like when Matt and Elektra first meet and they have a sort of mock battle in the park and she can't figure out how he can do back flips and everything - ""are you sure you're blind?"" It was quite an uplifting story as to how Matt came through the trauma of losing his sight, and then having his father murdered, and then his girlfriend but managed to make it through and triumph over Kingpin.But still there was just something about the movie that didn't gel. It wasn't a waste of money by any means, and I'd recommend anyone to go see it but hopefully if there is a sequel it will be a lot better.",Daredevil

I'm in! I thought this really might be interesting. Unfortunately, they totally blew it. There were a few nice ideas (like Matt / Daredevil being able to ""see"" Elektra in the rain on account of each drop making a sound when touching her ; or all the other scenes where Matt's ""vision"" is shown), but that's just as far as it goes. Instead of working on these ideas they relied on having a few alleged Hollywood hunks beating each other up with a alleged Hollywood beauty also beating people up. I may seem old-fashioned, but what happened to ""plot"", ""quality script"" and ""convincing acting""? No, this movie really sucked, a few good ideas just aren't enough; they rather make you angry: that story had potential- and that's all they were able to make of it.

Two things would have made the movie better. 1) Garner needed to have more time training to fight or she needed to be replaced with a more convincing fighter. Her moves seemed rather slow on film. 2) Colin, although I think he can act, should have taken a different stance on playing Bullseye. He made the character too campy.

431,essent,Good for what it is... a superhero movie.,7,18 February 2003,"I was not familiar with the Daredevil character before seeing the film, but I went at the prompting of my six year-old son. On the way out of the theater, my son, whose language isn't very developed, said that it was 'like Spiderman,' then a moment later said it was 'like Batman'. I knew exactly what he meant. Daredevil moves like these characters, and has a few other things in common with Batman, including an arch-enemy who was responsible for the death of the hero's parent(s)(which subsequently pushed them into their superhero roles). The idea of a blind superhero whose remaining four senses developed to superhuman levels seems to me to be a very novel and good idea. The moral questioning of the main character and the dark tone added to the film, also I thought it was visually very stunning.",Daredevil

It seemed like the timing was all off, it spent ages doing the flashback backstory, but the whole thing with the Kingpin seemed stupid and rushed. 15 minutes from the end he had had no contact or even any real knowledge of the Kingpin, then suddenly bulseye blurts out his real name and we get an anticlimactic climactic battle. I was sure they were going to have Kingpin remain undiscovered as a Palpatine style boss villan, maybe setting him up to be in a possible sequel. I still think that would have been better.In fact, it all seemed to start going down hill when Elektra's father was killed... this should have been a setup for a cool scenario where elektra was going out with Matt, but trying to kill daredevil. Instead they started and ended this whole story arc within about 15 minutes, which was a shame.The other thing that really bugged me was that, with 2/3rd of the story being a near-death flashback, when Bullseye turned up at the church the ""dying"" Daredevil suddenly jumped up and started fighting on the organ as if he was uninjured... pulling himself up with his injured arm with no problems at all. Even pro-wrestlers sell injuries for longer than than. Then when he faces kingpin he is suddenly ""injured"" again... and why does kingpin (who has shown no fighting skills) suddenly send all his guards away?????
""Man without fear""???? where did that come from? why? it never played a part in the plot.On the other hand, I liked the fact he was injured and scarred, the fact he had to pop all those painkillers... gave him a cool ""realism"". Starting with a dying superhero was different too, even if it turned out to be rubbish at the end.It felt like the plot needed a trilogy, but they just crammed it all in at the end.

433,mcmonster78,Much Better Than Expected,9,15 February 2003,"I didn't hold out high hopes for this film, but being a fan of most any comic movie I checked it out yesterday.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The action was great, it followed the comic really well, it was dark, and yes, Ben Affleck plays a good Daredevil.  There were two parts of the film I found a little flawed, the Matt Murdock/Elektra fight in the playground, and the fact that it took a long time to build up to where we started, and it resolved too soon.  I think they could have done with another 15-20 minutes to make it better.  As much as I liked Spider-Man it was a little campy, and I was afraid the same would happen for this movie, but thankfully daredevil stuck to his roots and made a movies that was more like the first Batman or the Crow in feel.  A round of applause for Jan Favreau and Joey Pants is in order, too.  Honorable mention goes to Kevin Smith in his cameo appearance. Finally, thankfully the studio chose a writer/director who actually read the comics for years, there is no one better have write comic book movies than comic book fans.  If it were any other Hollywood name, it may have been a failure. 9 out of 10.",Daredevil
434,Genevieve_Patrick,Watch Daredevil How It Should Be Seen,10,20 September 2009,"I first saw Daredevil in the cinema and to be fair to it, its not a bad film. But it is particularly average, nothing really special. In fact to me it was a bit of a disappointment, I'd really wanted more from it. Fast forward to now and anyone in the same position as me really really should watch the directors cut. Why this wasn't made the theatrical release I don't know! It improves on the original in every possible way. The film is generally a lot darker, showing the real price Matt Murdock pays for being Daredevil. There's an amazing scene expaned upon where he comes back from dealing with a rapist and he reveals his back to show many many scars and you get a great sense of his unhappiness. Also added is a new sub plot that deals with a man falsly accused of murder and Matt's defence of him as he follows the trail all the way back to the king pin. All of this helps build the finale up to more than just vengeance for a lost girlfriend but for all of hells kitchen. On top of that the completely redundant sex scene is removed which doesn't detract from his relationship with Electra, far from it, instead it builds it up into something purer and more special than it was before and more tragic when he loses her. The end fight with the kingpin is expanded uopn in a way that feels natural rather than forced, as if thats exactly how it should have been first time round. On top of this there have been lots of small touches included into the new edit, the emphasis on the catholic influences upon Murdocks life as well as a reference to his mother that fans of the comic will love. The parts of Ben Urich and Matt's law partner have been new and expanded scenes that all benefit the film. I really cant stress enough how much of an improvement this is, even if you loved the first cut you should watch this, I'm sure you'll be amazed! The darkness and humanity of the character have been brought to life superbly, and the end result is all the better for the changes.",Daredevil

436,kewlmatto,A step in the wrong direction for comic-book movies..,5,23 April 2003,"Spoiler Alert After the brilliant Spider-Man and the enjoyable X-Men, it truly looked like comic-book movies were finally on the way up, and were given the treatment and love that they deserved. As a dedicated Batman fan, I also have much interest in Daredevil (Marvel's closest counterpart), who is a great character in his own right. I was excited about the movie, especially after seeing the teaser trailer.Cut to five months later, and I get to go to the local preview screening after winning free tickets. Thankfully, I can proudly say that I didn't spend one cent on this movie. It was a disappointment on so many levels, and showed me that bad comic-book movies can still make their way through production.This movie seemed to take some of the good from Batman Returns, and some of the worst from Batman Forever. In terms of art direction - sets, backdrops, palettes, costumes - I was pleased. It had a really nice look to it. Very satisfied. This was the good.Unfortunately that didn't make up for the bad. Bad one liners, terrible, wooden acting, one dimensional characters and a story which felt rushed and hollow. I came out feeling like it was a pilot for a TV show actually, considering the amazing lack-of-ground it covered.First off, Daredevil. Ben Affleck isn't a bad actor, but he is always Ben Affleck. I didn't see the character there at all. It was a real shame. Total lack of development. The raspy voice isn't going to get you there by itself, Ben.  We hardly saw any of Matt, and the intense dichotomy with the legal side of his job and his vigilantism. A huge missed opportunity.Not to mention - killing the Quesada guy? (and why did Joe Q. lend his name to such a character?) I mean, he didn't even kill Kingpin, who killed people close to him, but he killed a rapist?. I don't know, maybe it's because I'm a diehard Batman fan but it seemed so hypocritical and made me lose all respect for this version of Daredevil. It undermined the whole point of the movie, basically. I fail to see how Daredevil could have ""grown"" so much through the few events and fights within the film.Next, Jennifer Garner. Well once again, no character, just Jen doing her stunt thing. (And I can't see how they could think that fight scene after fight scene could carry a movie on its own). The Elektra I've come to appreciate in the comics was totally absent. No mysteriousness. She didn't feel that dangerous. And she (and her father) were basically 100% American, no matter what they said. It detracted from her character and origin in so many ways. The love they had felt so contrived and rushed, I felt no empathy whatsoever.Colin Farrell now gets deleted from my list of Batman-contenders. Bullseye was pathetic. The 'comedy relief' of the movie was so utterly cheesy, it just brought back bad memories of Tommy Lee Jones, Arnie, Uma and Jim Carrey - the type of comic-book acting I thought could have possibly been dead, post-X-Men and Spider-Man. He barely had any lines, and I just cringed whenever he spoke anyway.And finally, Michael Clarke Duncan...hang on, was that guy in it? Oh that's right, right at the beginning, then right at the end. Once again - totally one dimensional - no convincing drive behind the character. The last fight scene was so corny (when he took off his shirt to get ready), I basically gave up on the movie then and there. Sigh. If one were to ad neon lights into this movie, you could say that this was a Schumacher film.The stunts were decent, some were great in fact, but no stunts can save a movie. The score was forgettable (only at the beginning and end), and the rest of the soundtrack was decent. Some tracks I loved (Evanescance's Bring Me To Life and the song that played at Mr Natchios' funeral), but the rest seemed like ""edgy rock filler"". Like I said before, TV pilot stuff.I had high hopes and sadly only a small portion of this movie delivered (like, 5%).If you are after a decent comic book movie, please, watch one of the first two Batmans, or the animated ones, X-Men or Spider-Man. Don't bother with Ben Affleck and his raspy voice. The fact that a sequel AND a spin-off is in the works is enough to make me dry-heave.",Daredevil
437,Bendrago,Dulldevil,3,19 February 2003,Rather predictable and most of all illogigal and dull. Why is it that when hollywood tries to do a movie about a superhero they end up with paper thin production with no values outside action / effects.Waste of time in my opinion.,Daredevil
438,Da-Ant,Comic Book Noir done right.,6,3 March 2003,"Daredevil is the movie Batman SHOULD have been.  Unlike Burton's Batman, which tries to make a dark movie just by having a dark set, Daredevil isn't afraid to question the moral authority of the main character just because he is a superhero.Although the director doesn't have the visual flair (or the big name)that Sam Raimi, Tim Burton or Bryan Singer, the proof of this movie is in the story, and that's where Daredevil shines.  It's about a character whose dual life actual conflicts with each other, on one hand a vengeful vigilante, and the other an (honest!) attorney who stays well within the bounds of the law. Unlike other superhero movies, where the characterizations are pure black and white, the movie Daredevil doesn't mind getting it's hands dirty. It's okay for the hero to question himself, and not be perfect, because besides his superpowers, he is still human, and like all of us, is fallible.I also find it interesting that so many people are attacking Affleck and Johnson, not so much for their work here, but because of past atrocities. Now, Affleck is an actor I can take or leave.  He's never annoyed me like he does many, but he's never impressed me all that much, either.  In the role of Murdock/Daredevil, he works.  He definitely has the physical presence for the superhero role, and his kind of bland charisma actually works in his favour for the Murdock role, as in the Miller comics, Matt Murdock WAS kind of a stick in the mud, except when Elektra was around.  She gave him life.The writer/director did a GREAT job on the script, for the most part capturing the essence of Miller's Daredevil.  His direction, though not as flashy as Raimi or Burton, wasn't bad, and, at least unlike the cheeseball Burton, never overpowers the script.Daredevil definitely deserves, if not the best comic book adaptation, then definitely the smartest.  It definitely holds it's own against Spiderman and Superman, is superior than X-Men, and whips the pants off Batman.  Of course, for those who like their action with a black and white moral point of view, steer clear.",Daredevil
439,dsnw43253,"Very good, but should be longer.",8,17 February 2003,"May include spoilers.Daredevil is a very good superhero movie but it could do with being a bit longer. I say this because it seems that we do not learn much about some of the main characters. For example, the Kingpin, I'd say, is only on screen for about 20 minutes, Bullseye doesn't have much to do until the last half hour of the movie (that goes for Elektra aswell) and Matt Murdock is only Daredevil for about 15 minutes in the first hour. The characters really needed to be expanded on - we don't hear much about Daredevils ""I'm the good-guy"" conflict with himself. And finally for the bad points, there needs to be more fight scenes between Daredevil and Bullseye & Kingpin (betwwen them they share about 3 fights). But other than that, the film is brilliant. The action is great, its dark, the diolog isn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be and in my eyes, its as good as Spider-man (but in a completley different way). You can, however, see where the film takes a tiny, tiny bit of inspiration from Batman (the final confrontation between Daredevil and Bullseye being in a church and the final confrontation between Batman and The Joker being in a cathedral). Ben Affleck is great as Daredevil, Michael Clarke Duncan is fantastic as Kingpin (and looks the part despit his comic book counterpart being white), Colin Farrel is perfect as Bullseye and as for Jennifer Garner (who I feared would be in too much of the movie), I just wish she was in it a lot more - she both looks and plays Elektra brilliantly.

Yeah the characters looked good, but 1.5 hours of posturing gets a bit dull without anything really happening.I loved Batman, The Matrix, The Crow, these kind of dark comic-book (-ish) tales but mostly because they were more than just style.Not bad, but not good either. 5/10.",Daredevil

442,jo-hanna,Shallow but entertaining.,7,16 June 2016,"Re. Spoilers: A couple of very minor ones, but on the whole, I think I've avoided them.. I've been avoiding this, since I LOVE the series, and saw the poor rating of this. I also thought Ben Affleck is too 'pretty' for this role (and read that he wasn't the best Batman..).. However, I tried to bury my preconceived ideas, and therefore enjoyed it: I'm pleased I watched it, since I can't watch the first two series of DD AGAIN just yet! :o Overall I thought it was rather 'shallow', but then again, it must be hard to squeeze such a lot of plot/characters into a couple of hours of film. I prefer every character/actor in the series, but still, I did like this. Farrell was amusing, but Duncan is just a gentle giant in my mind ('John Coffey'): the size of him fits, but I kept expecting him to say something sweet or funny.. What I liked most of all, which I missed in the series, is getting a bit of 'visual' (yeah I know..) on how Matt 'sees'. You're left to imagine it for yourself in the series. I was very disappointed in the 'mustard' scene.. till he swapped them! lol. When watching something like this I try to be open-minded. Each 'medium' is different, and if you compare them, you're often disappointed. Of course, it is often nigh-on impossible NOT to compare them, but I find it helps to try ;) P.S: I've never read comics, and had barely even heard of Daredevil before I watched the series (this film is probably why I'd even heard of it at all..)",Daredevil

Thanks to CGI being where it's at, Daredevil (similar to Spider-man) can now accurately portray the 'urban trapeze' act.   The story is your basic origin story, but for some reason its incredibly fun to watch this little Matt Murdoc run around in the beginning.Fans of the books all love little nods to writers and artists of the comic book series (a list of boxers in the flashback sequence has many of these names).  Also, a few shots in the picture are taken directly from the comic pages.Ben Affleck goes a little beyond being Affleck in the picture, most notably in the end fight sequence.The humor in the film is good nature, and walks the fine line of between comic relief and parody. (Does anyone remember what happened to the Batman movies?) This film really packed a lot of punch in its action, gritty atmosphere, but some of the line deliveries could ruin the picture for some.

Aside from those errors, the action was good (not great though), and the story is great (but the execution of the story was not as great). Acting by Affleck is somewhat respectable, there are instances of him looking like he tries to hard to put on an emotion. Gardner... ugh, is plain awful in this role, her acting is very static, its as if she ONLY says the lines, no heart, no enthusiasm. Recommended to kids for the full satisfaction experience.

One of Marvel's most complex characters who could have been made into a great film, is stripped from all depth and reduced to just fighting (badly choreographed too!). Shame for the casting, which for the most part was excellent, as was Daredevil's costume and the movie soundtrack. In case there is a sequel, remember that Karen has played a very important part in Matt's life and should be used more, try to create an adequately dark atmosphere and please get a director who understands what Daredevil is all about.

But this wasn't the case with daredevil, from DareDevil's first Vigilante act to the ruthlessness of BullsEye, DD had a certain vulnerability and the films willingness to admit that ""hey people can and do die"" made it more ""realistic"" (if you can say that about a SuperHero movie)",Daredevil

Why must movie studios always feel they know better than the director. This film would have been much more successful had they left it alone, but by insisting on so many cuts and changes they shot themselves in the foot. All because they wanted a family friendly spider-man type film instead of the much more dark and violent world of daredevil. Every scene added to the film makes you wonder why they cut it in the first place. It isn't just about adding scenes though they have taken a couple out too. I can't imagine anyone who would miss the fireside love scene. I urge everyone who saw the theatrical cut to watch the directors cut. It isn't a perfect film but it's a more complete and enjoyable one. Also watch the documentary on the directors cut DVD and see one of the producers trying to defend the original release and then actually saying he thinks it is the better cut.

451,DanielleMyBelle,A Devil of a Disappointment,4,16 February 2003,"I saw this movie at the last showing of the opening day at 10:35 p.m. and the place was packed. I had thought it would be, but for a late-ish showing, this was sort of impressive. I could feel the excitement in the air. This movie had had non-comic book fans buzzing for over a year, let alone those that had followed the story avidly since its birth in the pages of the popular Marvel series. I, myself, had been looking forward to this film since the first trailers. The only preconceived negative notions I had toward the movie were those regarding my previous opinion of Ben Affleck's sub-par acting prowess. But I was even on the fence about that. So, anyway, the movie began and I was drawn in right away by the visual effects including the interesting Braille/cityscape opening titles and the literally awesome image of Daredevil himself wrapped around a sky-scraping cross. This movie had so much promise, it made me tingle. Would they delve into Matt Murdock's personal struggle of the virtue of vigilante-ism? Would they highlight the interesting religious symbolism in the story? Would there at least be some innovative action scenes and stunning special effects? The answer to these questions and many more was ""Not really."" What followed the promising beginning was a corny, sloppily-written, un-clever screenplay with mostly mediocre acting and only semi-exciting fight sequences. The story had gaping holes that only grew as the plot literally unraveled (i.e. Why did Matt use blasting music to drown out noise in the beginning if loud noises hurt him so terribly, as was illustrated in the preposterous organ fight scene near the end?) There were a couple of scenes that suggested a tongue-in-cheek quality (i.e. Matt and Electra's childlike fight in the playground, Bullseye catching every piece of a shattered stain-glass window in perfect stacks and pitching them at an inexplicably back-flipping Daredevil), but the style was so muddy that I couldn't be sure whether these were purposefully amusing or unintentionally ridiculous. Ben Affleck's performance solidified my previous feelings on his abilities, or, more appropriately, lack thereof and Jennifer Garner's performance was only as good as the script (suggesting that she did the best she could with what she was given). Colin Farrell as Bullseye turned in the film's best performance as an engagingly creepy and often funny villain who could have better filled this movie than did the titular character. Jon Favreau, too, did a fine job as Matt Murdock's attorney buddy, Franklin and Kevin Smith made a cute cameo mid-film. As for the action, I would say it was as mediocre as was the acting. There were one or two scenes that were up to par (i.e. Daredevil vs. Bullseye on motorcycle), but the rest used rehashed stop-motion Matrix techniques and other methods making the fact that Daredevil and Electra are mere humans out of the realm of suspension of disbelief. Overall, I would give this movie a four out of ten, which is not terrible. It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was incredibly disappointing, especially in comparison to other super hero movies like X-Men or the sublime Unbreakable.",Daredevil
452,NormAbrams,Weak adaptation of the great Frank Miller Comics,1,15 February 2003,"It's a shame Kevin Smith is merely an actor rather than writer or director of this incredibly average movie. Had Mr. Smith, an admitted comics geek and great filmmaker, been in charge, one has to think this might have been good.As it is, a decent cast is ruined by a lousy script, idiotic dialogue and jumpy direction. You're better off reading the original Frank Miller Daredevil comics this movie's based on. It's been collected in a 3 volume set called ""Daredevil Visionaries"". Volume 2 (Miller was only the artist in Volume 1) is actually the best one to start with as Miller began as writer/artist in this volume.",Daredevil

It was whole lot better than the shoddy X-Man nonsense we had to suffer a few years back!It was coherent, well put together, fun and very watchable, although some of the CGI fight scenes looked a bit shoddy, and at times the hand held camera work was difficult to follow.Affleck plays his regular ""likeable guy"" character, which is well suited to the heroic DareDevil/Murdock.Farrell completely overacts as the ludicrous assasain Bullseye, who for some reason the screen writers don't try to justify the existence of.  (A shame after the great jobs done bringing the Green Goblin and the Joker off the comic book page into the ""real"" world).The film is also quite dark, both in terms of lighting and emotionally, with refreshing commentary on the thin line between good and bad walked by the vigilante.Overall, well worth the entry fee, and I'm still looking forward to Hulk and Spiderman 2....",Daredevil
454,zach__anderson,Another GREAT Marvel Comics Movie!!,8,23 February 2003,"As the release date of Daredevil approached, I became more and more skeptical of Ben Affleck's ability to actually pull-off a super-hero movie. After seeing it last night though, I no longer doubt this ability, nor do I doubt anybody else's abilities in the all-star cast.The fighting scenes were excellently done. The presentation of Daredevil's superhuman senses was even better than I imagined. Jennifer Garner is one of the hottest actresses who can kick anyone's ass. Michael Clarke Duncan's gave a great performance as the Kingpin. Collin Farrell is one of my new favorite villain's in Bullseye. Everything about this movie is just as dark as it is truly beautiful.There were two major elements about the movie that made me give it a score of 8 instead of 10 though. First, when Daredevil kills that rapist in the subway, the problem is that in the comic books, Daredevil has never maintained a ""criminals must die"" mentality. He has actually gotten into fights with other superheroes over this belief, so when this happened in the movie, I was a little miffed. Somebody has brought it to my attention that Daredevil actually killed his first criminal on his first outing in his hero persona, but my only response to that would be the fact that the incident in the subway station was presented as not being Daredevil's ""first time"".Second, the god-awful soundtrack is touted around scene after scene in the movie. The main problems with this is that: a.) The music really, REALLY sucks; and b.) The music dates the movie. Watching the movie 10 years from now when our culture's preferences in music have changed will make us more critical of this movie in the long run. Nobody is going to remember these songs or the people who sang them in ten years, and I wish that they were not there to begin with.Other than that, I can't understand why there are so many people who didn't like this movie. If you liked Spider-man, you'll like this movie even better because, simply put, Daredevil is a better movie. The plot is well-written, the characters are as likeable as they are believable, and the special-effects/fight scenes are top-notch. It really is great that the Marvel superheroes are getting treated so well in the film industry.",Daredevil
455,liggins00@aol.com,Good comic book adaptation,8,15 February 2003,"Saw the late showing of Daredevil last night...pretty good comic book adaptation.  I have been collecting Daredevil comic books for several years now, and I think they do a great job with only about 100 minutes to tell the story.  Starts with a bang...Daredevil's life flashing before his eyes after being seriously injured in a battle, going back to his origin.  Very stylish.  I think the much maligned Ben Affleck does a good job as the title character.  Jennifer Gardner is super hot as Elektra, Colin Ferrel is great as Bullseye, and Michael Clarke Duncan is good as the Kingpin, although he's not given very much to do in this movie.But the movie is as much about Daredevil battling himself and his inner demons as it is about him fighting the badguys.  Is he a hero, or just some lawless vigilante?  That's the underlying theme of the film, and that's what sets it apart from other superhero movies.  It's hard to compare this with Spider-Man, because I think they both faithfully reproduce their comic book subjects.  I do feel that this movie is superior to that GROSSLY OVERRATED Batman flick!  I think all films like these should start with the character's origin, and Batman never did that (I never did like Tim Burton movies).  Of all the superhero franchises, this was my least favorite, but I digress.One thing that I didn't like was the over-the-top CGI sequences.  DD jumps so far sometimes that he looks more like Superman!  However, I thought the representation of his radar sense was spot on, and there is plenty of action to keep fans happy.  I think the film will be appreciated more by comic book geeks like myself than the masses, and won't put up the gargantuan numbers that Spider-Man did this summer.",Daredevil
456,liggins00@aol.com,More Realistic Look at a Hero,8,16 February 2003,"For those who have commented that this movie was boring or predictable, you all must have slept through that debacle of a movie called BATMAN!  At least in this film, they told DD's origin, something they never did in Batman. The film was stylish, true to the comic book, and action packed...everything Batman should have been but was not (OK, it did have style, but absolutely no substance).  Don't come into this movie looking for the same experience you got watching Spider-Man--this film is much darker and more realistic, in my opinion.  --SPOILER-- When his enemies in the flick get the hero down, what do they do?  What any of us would do...they take off his mask!!! When Daredevil has to choose between saving someone on the street he picks up with his razor sharp hearing or sleeping with Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner, looking hotter than ever), what does he do?  What any red-blooded heterosexual male would do, he sleeps with Elektra!  This is in contrast to Peter Parker walking away from Mary Jane at the end of Spider-Man.  --End Spoiler--He bleeds, spits out teeth, takes painkillers, and is hauntingly lonely as a result of his heightened senses and superhero status.  It's this kind of realism that makes this film stand out.  If you have any reservations about this film, don't listen to the critics...go see it for yourself.  I did and I enjoyed the show.",Daredevil
457,scoot_laird,"Disappointing, but good.",4,14 February 2003,"Daredevil is one of my favorite superheroes and is a very good choice for a movie. The trailers had me iffy. On the one hand it had it looked like a highly stylized dark and sinister Batman type of movie, and on the other hand it looked like a piece of crap Matrix rip-off  with bad music. Luckily it was more the first then the second.Affleck gives a worthy performance, as does Garner. Michael Clarke Duncan was simply not in it enough, but the true gem of the movie was Colin Farrell as Bullseye. The directing is to par with the movie, but at times goes overboard, the script is passable, but wouldn't have worked without the strong performances.However, the movie is just too short, there was a lot more to be dealt with, and we needed more story behind the villains. They left it to open for a sequel, and made the big mistake of having a vital plot point after some of the credits had rolled by, so make sure you stick around for a minute.All in all it's a good action flick with lots of fun, nothing to get really excited about, but worth the trip to theater.It's no Batman (though it wants to be), it's no Spider-Man (though it could have been) and it's no Punisher (and I'm glad it's not!)Good movie, go see it, don't hold your breath come Oscar season :)7/10",Daredevil
458,VitaliBird,"Excellent Movie, better than Spiderman",8,11 March 2003,"Even though Spiderman and Daredevil were quite similar by plot, I found Daredevil to be a lot better. Daredevil is geared toward people with a more ""adult"" taste in movies, while Spiderman was generally geared toward pre-teens.

459,sith-7,Much better than I expected having seen reviews here.,8,23 February 2003,"I went into this arms crossed expecting to walk out.  I was pleasantly suprised.  I do not read the DareDevil comics or the Electra comics either. So I can't judge in that way.
Bad first.  Towards the end when DD is wounded he cannot make up his mind if it hurts.  One moment he is limping along like a wounded puppy, the next he is spinning through the air after Bullseye, apparently there is no pain.....Oops, next scene, ow! that hurts, that's a wound.  A little sloppy. One glaring continuity error.  Electra creeps up on DD, she is dressed in Jeans, next scene she is in a Red number on his roof.  Does she keep a wardrobe there?????Good.  MC Duncan as Kingpin.  Excellent.  I had my doubts about this but he was superb.  He is Kingpin. The fight choreography is superb and had me well and truly hooked. Electra,  Smokin!  She would look good anywhere.  Although from the comics I have seen she seemed smaller than I expected.  But she was damn good.Overall I liked the film, and as a person who doesn't read the comics it was superb.  But if you are heavily into the scene then there may well be inaccuracies I wouldn't notice.  I found the film well paced, balanced and funny.",Daredevil
460,BluesManBDR529,"The best comic movie ever, hands down!",10,14 February 2003,"I just got out of seeing Daredevil, and, OH MY GOSH!  This movie could not have been better.  Spider-Man held the prize for the best comic book movie until I saw this.  Daredevil blew it and every other comic movie out of the water.  The acting is awesome, Colin Farrell rocks as Bullseye, and Michael Clarke Duncan IS the Kingpin!  I was greatly surprised by Ben Affleck's performance as well, he played the part to a tee.  The movie perfectly follows the book to the letter, and if you thought that Spider-Man and X-Men weren't dark enough, than this one is for you.  This is by far the darkest comic movie I've seen.  I'll be honest;  I went in expecting this movie to be a suckfest, but I was totally blown away!  If you want to see the best comic to movie adaptation ever than don't miss this one!  Oh yeah, don't leave when the credits start to roll or you'll miss out on a little Russian Roulette!",Daredevil
461,michaelkendall2,Sheer class...,10,16 July 2003,"Daredevil joins the likes of Superman 2 and The Crow in the ranks of the best comic book adaptations, and is superbly directed and acted throughout, maintaining a beautifully consistent sense of mood and pace without sacrificing the surprisingly well-rounded characterisations.  A dark, thrilling, moving [and blackly comic] comic book masterpiece. All I can say to Mark Steven Johnson is roll on Ghostrider!",Daredevil
462,Pserious,wasnt expecting much,4,3 September 2003,"Going into this I have heard from everyone that this movie is pretty bad except for one of my friends. But he doesnt count because he's a little bias. I was just hoping that there was some way that I might find this movie alright but as expected it really wasnt all that great. The character set up is horrible and this movie has some of the most insanely unrealistic scenes ever. Wait a minute, come to think of it, this movie was straight up bad! This is like the fifth straight bad movie that Ben Afleck has been in and i'm starting to lose faith in him. But i will take this movie any day over Pearl Harbor!",Daredevil
463,SharpShooter5,The Best comic book movie yet,9,2 August 2003,"Daredevil (DD from here on in) in my opinion is the best comic book movie yet.  Mark Steven Johnson (the director)was the best man for the job, he's a die hard DD fan and he brought a very dedicated version to the big screen.Ben Affleck, who at first is not your first choice to play a superhero does an excellent job in the movie, and i hope he comes back for the sequels. Jennifer Garner is also great as Elektra and i look forward to the Elektra solo film.  The rest of the cast is just as great, from Colin Ferell as the menacing Bullseye, to Joe Pantalliano as the snooping reporter and Micheal Clark Duncan as the crime lord Kingpin.Daredevil is not only tops in performances, but both the story, and CGI are much better than they were in Spider-man, had DD been a more popular superhero like Spider-man, Superman or Batman, it could have made the money those films did, but because DD is more of a cult favorite in the comic book world, the film didn't do as well as it should have (although at $107 million it still did good ).But i do recommend you buy the DVD, you'll for sure watch the film over and over again (also i should point out that FOX knew this film had its fans and treated them to a very good DVD, not only in sound and picture quality but in the extras as well)So to sum it up, Daredevil is all what a comic book movie should be, fast, fun and true to the nature of the original source10 stars",Daredevil
464,gpschofield666,"Daredevil,,I enjoyed it",8,8 February 2005,"Personally think people criticise too much stuff far too easily. Take this film. It won't win any Oscars or anything else like that, and if you look into it, it has some plot omissions or oddities.HOWEVER, those that criticise it to the point that they say its "" rubbish"" must just be very jaded individuals. Why not enjoy the film for what it is meant to be...it's not meant to be life altering, it's not intended to be entirely meaningful....is it not enough for you that a film entertains you for 90 mins, has lots of action, excellent costumes, reasonable acting and good production values? Daredevil was never going to be in another "" the Pianist"" or "" Gone with the wind"" ( I state those 2 films simply because they were both critically acclaimed), but rather, a crash bang wallop film that was meant to be FUN and ENTERTAINING.All those kinds of folks that criticise too easily...well all I can say, you must have a tough time finding stuff to entertain...and when you can't you probably slate films that aren't destined to be classics.I almost never discuss films and TV shows with a couple of my friend anymore, because they criticise everything to the Nth degree, and that takes the fun out of a film or show, and in my opinion as much as these people are my friends, they really are totally up their own asses.DD was fun, The new Punisher was FUN, Spiderman was fun, Hulk was...a bad story.( god it's not like they haven't got enough source info out there to make a good story). I'd say the only problem with many films these days, is so often, they've simply been done before in different guises.But what the hell, I enjoy lots of them just the same.

He cannot jump that far, and this is a seasoned comic-book nerd speaking.3. King Pin was not that small, or black.4.

466,evanwolf,Should have been made on an indie budget.,2,14 February 2003,"Should have been made on an indie budget.Daredevil doesn't connect.You can skip Daredevil the movie.Poor casting, cinematography, direction, art direction, choreography, and animation.No chemistry on screen between Matt and Elektra.A camera never letting action unfold, choosing points of view that don't let actors perform.The story has many moments for emotion to unfold, but you never feel with or for the characters. No emotional payoff. Ever. Just distance. The flick alludes to Matt Murdock's inner demons, his fears, his losses, the tension between his two lives. But you never sympathize or empathize. Either the director didn't give enough screen time for feelings instead of emotions, or he shot the footage and it's on the cutting room floor.The combat is weak, despite hand-to-hand and fighting sticks being the Daredevil's stock in trade. See a Jet Li flick instead.The CGI characters that leap 50 to 100 feet are unreal.Any one of these would have been enough to tank the film.The worst crime is that done to the spirit of Hell's Kitchen. It's a dirty, scummy, vice ridden, violent, dangerous place. Corruption and money denies city services to these poorest of New York. So the streets are strewn with garbage, the people are sick from industrial waste and filth-spawned disease, the cops only come when it is too late, youth gangs and organized crime rule with fear, and brutalized children starve. Despair gives hope a daily body blow.That gritty sensibility ain't on screen. So this people's champion is out of context.Daredevil is supposed to be the spiritual counterpoint to the Kitchen's open wound. A gifted man defending the oppressed and helpless against oppressive forces in an uncaring world.The film just doesn't get it across. Maybe if they cut the budget across the board, they'd have made a better movie. Fewer wasted effects, deeper character and plot development. The story begs for an indie film touch.So: skip it.",Daredevil
467,Louise-16,Wonderful Valentine's Day action movie,10,13 August 2003,"I love this movie. I started out really liking it and my love for it grows every time I see it. While I realize comic book movies may not be for everyone, this is not a ""mere"" comic book movie. For one thing, it has an intriguing premise: a blind man who is also a superhero. It's also a love story, which made it a perfect release for Valentine's Day weekend (which was also President's Day weekend this year). Ben Affleck turns in a fine performance as lawyer Matt Murdock and superhero Daredevil. He makes it look natural, only getting melodramatic when it's called for. Jennifer Garner is wonderful as Elektra, Matt's love interest with a penchant for using sais. Colin Farrell is also perfectly over-the-top (he even admits in the DVD extras he played the character over the top) as Bullseye, the homicidal maniac who never misses. And Michael Clarke Duncan is also perfect as the Kingpin, the crime boss in charge of underworld activity in New York City.As a comic book fan, I've always been an on-and-off reader of Daredevil - I'm more of a Spider-Man girl, myself - but this movie renewed my interest in the character and I'm now buying the book again. Comic book fans may quibble about Elektra's and Bullseye's costumes and Kingpin's color, but I encourage them to see past these minor differences and enjoy the spirit of the movie. For non-comic readers, I think if you like action flicks that are darker and have some romance thrown in, you will like this movie. It's a strong PG - I would suggest you preview it before you show it to the kids. But for adults this is almost a can't-miss movie. Unless of course, you hate lawyers, superheroes, mob movies AND romance, in which case don't waste your time. :)",Daredevil

It's trying to tell a different type of story, it takes a lot of chances by making changes from the source material, and it really does stand out as being different.  It's biggest flaw is that it tries to be something different than what people think it should be.  The script is strong and very realistic - almost everyone talks like real people - and the acting is very good: the actors are all talking TO each other instead of just AT each other, or merely saying lines.This is definitely a worthy film that stands out from any other film in this genre, and that should be considered a strength, not a weakness.",Daredevil

Spiderman and X-Men were both good movies but not thrilling or moving enough to get me to watch them repeatedly (ie. purchase them on DVD) This movie is rewatchable.

It's my preference to be able to suspend my disbelief, and I couldn't do it for more than two minutes at a time. Between the archetypes and the in-your-face Marvel Comics moments, it just doesn't fly for me.It's not that I don't like Ben Affleck: I remember seeing the trailer and thinking that this would be so ultimate. It's the ultimate in shallowness for an action film.Don't waste your time on the original.

I found myself irritated during some of the more dramatic scenes, such as the funeral or the love scenes. It was like they were creating something visual to match the length of the song they chose, but slow-mo walking to fill out a 3:22 song is a cheat, and the viewers expect better.This said, by the end, I was really wishing there would have been a sequel.

473,jwillis81,Noir superheroes are back!,7,22 February 2003,"After seeing Daredevil, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.  I walked in expecting a stinker.  The previews, in my opinion, were not very flattering, and the reviews others had given me were disappointing.  The one saving grace I had heard was that Daredevil is a dark superhero story, more reminiscent of 1989's Batman with Michael Keaton than of more recent comic book fare like Spider-Man or X-Men.Although I dearly loved both Spider-Man and X-Men, I could not justify a nice or sugar-coated story to Daredevil, one of the most interesting characters in the Marvel repetoire.  His is a story of darkness and ambiguity, and a noir-style film is best suited for such a story.That being said, I was not particularly impressed with the special effects. Daredevil's radar vision was fairly impressive, but in general the fight sequences left me somewhat lacking.  Kudos to the special effects and sound design teams for blending (or trying to blend) the real world and Daredevil's world during the fights, but for me, it just didn't seem to work that well.The performances were acceptable.  As a fan of both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, I wasn't disappointed, although I definitely thought both could have stretched their acting abilities a little more.  Both are capable of so much more, and to see them practically walking through the script was a little disappointing.  This disappointment was easily offset by Colin Farrell's performance as Bullseye, which I consider the best element of the movie. After The Recruit and this turn in Daredevil, Colin Farrell has cemented himself in my opinion as one of the better in his generation of Hollywood actors.All in all, I'd say Daredevil was a worthy effort.  7 out of 10.",Daredevil

Forget the reviews; if you liked the Frank Miller Daredevil comics from the 80s, this film captures that mood perfectly. The art direction was great, Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock is perfectly cast, you really believe he's blind. The sound waves, as sensed by Daredevil, are superbly realized. New York looks great. It's been said many times recently that most major, much quoted reviewers are out of touch with the public sentiment (remember Titanic? You had to have a cold heart not to love that one) this one is the same. It's great fun, the casting of Kingpin was great, Ben Urich, I really did like the movie, as much as, maybe even more so, than Spiderman. My one complaint is that they changed Elektra's back story. In the comics, she was trained by an ascetic group of ninjas in the Himalayas or some such place, known as the hand. Bullseye is great; he does a better Brad Pitt than Brad Pitt does.

I'm afan of the comics and was won over by all the articles about MarkSteven Johnson's passion for the film. I saw it today and was fairlydissapointed with the outcome. There are good moments, but theyare overshadowed by too many weak elements. In its favoutr, the""radar vision"" of Daredevil is very well done, and Colin Farrell'sBullseye is entertaining but underused. In the hands of a better film maker, this could have been great, butJohnson is lacking an originality that would have elevated this tothe same sort of level as the original Batman. The fight scenes arefilmed almost all in fast flashy close up cuts that show neither whois winning, or how the fighting is done. The early fight between Mattand Elextra is better, as Johnson shows some restraint andactually lets us see the two of them fighting rather than justshowing a blur of hands and weapons. The characters are underdeveloped, and I felt that Electra,Bullseye, Kingpin and even Foggy were extended cameo's morethan real parts. Matt Murdoch showed signs of depth, but neverproperly scraped the surface. My final gripe ( of many !) is the structure of the piece. Instead ofbuilding to a climax, it just saunters along without a real plot tospeak of. I felt liked I'd been robbed of a big finish.

Collin Ferrell is actually B-A-D as the bad guy Bullseye. He's just plain terrible!!! And his special ability is...he can throw things really fast?! L-A-M-E!!! Jennifer Garner's Electra is not much more than a token love interest.  Apparently, she is a superhero...but do they ever tell the audience that in the film? Nope. She's just this normal girl who apparently can leap 150 feet from building-to-building. There's literally no explanation for why she can do this. The plot is thin and sometimes incoherent while a lot of the dialogue is hokey. The action tries to rip off THE MATRIX at every turn with it's own take on bullet-time. Some of the special effects are bad as can be while Ben Affleck is at his Ben Affleckiest throughout the film's entirity.In fact, the only good things I can say about the film are #1) a quick cameo by Stan Lee early on and #2) a rain-soaked scene between Garner and Affleck where he explains how and why he loves the rain. You'll understand that too when you see the film (even though YOU SHOULDN'T!!!) It's quite a beautiful little moment.Other than that DAREDEVIL is a travesty to the superhero movie.

479,Dark Genius,"Good, but no Spidey",7,18 February 2003,"I went into Daredevil expecting an incredible movie hyped for around 8 months. As is often true, movies don't live up to their hype and Daredevil is another fateful example of this. Other such dissapointments include X-Men and Episode 1/2.Daredevil, while indowed with plenty of incredible action scenes, falls short in the department of something that every film needs. That department, the audience's care for the characters, is ultimately far underdeveloped. We, the audience, fail to care for these characters packed into a 90 minute mini-movie of a great comicbook. Daredevil, a second tier character, would seem to be a very good person to base a movie on; however, it falls short due to his portrayal. He is a dark, destructive character who places revenge above morality. Normally, it would seem that the vengeful human race would find solice in a character such as this.  This mess of a film throws us into the live of Matt Murdock in the capable hands of Ben Affleck. BA gives a generally stand-up performance normally uncharacteristic of his skills.  The great Kingpin isn't given enough screen time and the audience doesn't really care about him. It mattered nothing to me if he died or killed hundreds of others. He simply wasn't given enough time to formulate an evil presence.The same is true with Bullseye, the ""main villian"" of this Daredevil picture.  Although the writers tried to portray him as this evil assassin, I ultimately thanked him for his victories. I wanted that old hag to die just as much as him and thought the whole paper-clip death was fun. However, it just didn't create an evil persona for him and he comes off almost as comedic relief. This here is one fan that thinks Colin Farrell is probably the most overestimated actor out there right now. As of now, he has yet to star in a movie that I could sit through without wincing in agony every few minutes(I.E. American Outlaws).Lastly I think that Jennifer Garner was perfect as the Deadly Electra. She fits the role to a ""t"" and doesn't falter even with the few lines that she is given.  Plus, who wouldn't want to look at Jennifer for a 90 minute film. *watches the complete lack of raised hands*.I give it the popular consensus of 6/10 just below X-Men, but far off from the glory of Spider-Man.",Daredevil

All I can say is give me a break.Daredevil is more like Batman ( which is probably the best comic movie ever made) with its darkness and death, yet in many ways it has more sensitivity and feelings than Batman, simply because Matt Murdock, unlike Bruce Wayne, shows his pain...and his love for people he cares for.Ben, Jennifer, Colin, Michael are all great...add a couple of Sopranos and I would say you (or should I say Fox and Marvel) have a hit on your hands...Daredevil it is time for you to start hangin with a SPIDER and a BAT!...IMPRESSIVE.",Daredevil
481,ambydupuis,What you saw in the theaters was not Daredevil,7,16 March 2005,"When I first saw the theater release, I saw a movie with poor action sequences badly put together without an inch of consistency.2 years later, I give the Director's cut a try (I really like those comics superheroes), and as I recognize that the poor action sequences are still there, this version contains a whole bunch of character development that is the essence of Daredevil. The 30 minutes added do slow the movie down a bit, but for the better, you get to see the duality into Murdock (Ben Affleck)'s eyes, the conflict between justice and evil. This director's cut is the version we should have seen in the theaters, 133 minutes is not that long.My vote was originally 4, today I give it a 7. Just give it a try.",Daredevil
482,irfan_baig,"Good try, could do wayyyy better!",5,15 February 2003,"I really was not expecting too much of this film, although I did find the comics rather interesting. Ben Affleck does not really fit in well as a ficticious super-hero with Martial Arts capabilities. Jennifer Garner was good, disappointingly not much was seen of her as the Electra we expect. Collin Farell was hillarious as an Irish hitman named Bulls Eye. I would call this soon-to-be superstar the highlight of the film. Michael Clarke Duncan did a decent job (as expected) of his tid-bit bad and ugly role.
Overall I would give this movie a 5/10. Jennifer Garner was sexy alright, but too decent compared to the Electra in the comics. Ben Affleck, he is better off playing a soldier or a lawyer or a doctor maybe even go back to Kevin Smith movies as he is, but not a super-hero for our sake :)",Daredevil
483,fishgutz,Colin Farrell shines,6,16 February 2003,"This movie has it all, the big-time movie hunk, new comer chick, and the badass Irish guy. Everything that is, except for a strong script. Half the time I was trying to figure out if the people are super-human, or just if they just did really, really well in gymnastics class. The only time during the movie when I wasn't thinking about what I was going to eat for dinner that night, or why the entire cast is decked out in pleather, was when Colin Farrell was on screen. Playing the psychotic killer from his native Ireland, Bullseye, he proves he can fare well in the acting biz. Over all I think Ben Affleck wasn't a good choice for the roll of Matt Murdock, or Daredevil, simply because his name is too big. He just dosen't have that super-hero feel, you know, like, Elijah Wood. Okay, bad example. Really bad example. Overall, a C+",Daredevil
484,blackheart981,Okay film.,7,29 December 2003,"After seeing a great comic adaption done by Sam Raimi for Spider-man, I was pumped up to see another superhero take the big screen. Daredevil: Man without fear was more like man that needed to be a little more emotional. I'll just skip to the review points. Ben Affleck needs to be more emotional if he was to play a blind man. He is so stiff as his role as Matt Murdock. How he got the part is still beyond me. Jennifer Garner as Elecktra was decent but badly wasted in the film. Colin Farell as Bullseye was awesome! The sad thing though is that he doesn't wear a costume when his character does in the comics. Cheap budget I guess. Last, Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin? He was good too but the fact is that Kingpin is a white guy in all marvel comics. For now, Duncan's cool.Movie starts out great then we get treated to ultimately boring romance scene in the middle. Of course we get more of Ben Affleck's non-believable blind man acting. If the sequel does come out, I hope it won't turn out like this one.",Daredevil

487,bryedtan_02,A Darker and more gritty Spider-man,7,26 June 2003,Daredevil has many of the aspects of your typical Marvel Comic hero. The tragic death of a love one accident that gives the character extraordinary powers. One thing different is the setting of the film is darker and more urbane all the darkness I began to think of Gotham city than New York. Unlike our friendly neighborhood wall crawler who bust crooks and gifts wrap them to cops. Daredevil's purpose is mostly to seek justice or vengeance on those who believe they are above the law.The film captures the atmosphere of the Daredevil comics that were written by Frank Miller which is great. The story does get a little confusing along the way but it the action sequences make up for a lot. Not in the level of Spider-Man and the X-men movies in capturing all the essence of the comics it still makes an entertaining popcorn movie to watch.,Daredevil
488,mattrocks85,Director's Cut!,7,24 May 2011,"Please note that this review refers to the Director's Cut and not the theatrical version. So what makes the Director's Cut a 7 as opposed to a 4 for the theatrical release? Character development actually happens and plot holes are filled. the most important character that gets some much needed development in the DC is the Kingpin. In theaters, Kingpin comes off as just a rich thug or a glorified hit-man. The DC allows us to see him for what he really is which is a criminal mastermind and underworld boss who maintains a careful facade as a legitimate businessman. Unfortunately, Elektra still seriously lacks a back story that explains how the ultra-privileged daughter of a rich businessman can also go toe-to-toe with Daredevil. Surprisingly, the action scenes were pretty crisp and clever (see Bullseye's usage of the organ tubes to mess with Daredevil's senses and gain an advantage in the fight).The DC, however, does not address the one major pitfall of this movie - casting. Ben Affleck has a pretty specific set of roles that he can shine in; this is not one of them. See Boiler Room, The Town, Good Will Hunting, and other like dramas for evidence the he can actually act because I promise you he can. Super Heroes are just not his thing. Not to mention that he actually doesn't even really LOOK the part of the Irish ""man Without Fear"". Even worse than that is the casting of Jennifer Garner. I think producers were a little too high on her role in Alias as a super spy and thought she could pull off super assassin as well.Two casting pluses in this movie, however, were Colin Farrell and Joe Pantoliano - both VERY talented actors. Colin Farrell played a great bad guy and perfectly portrayed Bullseye's unstable personality. Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urich was also great as he really captured that hardened, veteran, journalist that the character is so loved for in the comics. I'm not sure why they allowed Colin Farrell to use his native Irish accent, but it doesn't really detract much from his character.All in all, the Director's Cut is definitely a step up from the theatrical version although there were still some serious flaws that prevented this from being a great movie.",Daredevil
489,wang451,No thank you,4,26 August 2003,"Misfit and miscast, this is the beginning of Affleck's downwards spiral towards what was that movie... He looks unfit and uncomfortable in his role. I like the darkness that they tried to give the movie, but the acting and surroundings are too fake for anything to work. It sounded like a really good movie though.",Daredevil
490,whstrock,Too much and too little,6,16 December 2004,"If you remember the days of the Batman standard of having at least two villains per movie starting with Catwoman and Penguin then you remember that it made the movies very busy with multiple stories none of which got enough attention to make any of them worthwhile. In this instance I don't think the movie falls apart nearly so much but then Batman had several other problems added to the mix. Daredevil whips quickly into the story of this comicbook character's arch enemy (Bullseye), his greatest love (Elektra), and the great evil force behind everything (Kingpin) all in one movie. And on top of it all the movie has to take time to cover the origin of Daredevil himself. The lawyer Matt Murdock's partner is well cast, played and written. Daredevil is correctly portrayed (for the most part) both as a character and visually. The casting choice for Kingpin although not in line with the character as drawn in the books makes more sense than the books and works to the movies advantage. Bullseye was relatively well done (crazy and talented). Elektra was OK but the point is that each of these parts were thrown by the viewer at a reckless pace. It was like going to the ice cream store and only getting samples, never buying a full cone of ice cream. By the time the spinning sensation stopped the movie was over. There is a fight scene in a playground that should not even made it into the movie. It makes little to no sense. Liking the Daredevil comic book is probably the main reason that I stuck this one out. A few more like this and comics won't make it to the screen any more.",Daredevil
491,nathan_summers508,I can't believe we rate this one so low,10,2 September 2013,"I come back to this film in the wake of the Batman announcement, and it still amazes that we rate it as a bad movie, honestly, it is flawed and it is not The Dark Knight, but it tried many of the things that Nolan perfected, it feels like a criminal drama with costumes at parts, and that is a good thing, the cast is not as colossal, not as good as Batman would get, the hero also is much less known for the average movie goer but this movie right here has all the seeds that will eventually grow into the two best movies of heroes -both of 2008- At this moment in time 10 years after it's release, the effects are dated, the music is a minus for most people. But for me, even if annoying it manages to integrate itself into the narrative of the film, it is a noisy thing for a guy whose world is a noisy place to live. The movie tries to cram so much into too little space, but there is a Director's Cut that saves some of these and makes the hero even more of a dimensional character, this 10 is not because the movie is perfect, but because it is seriously underrated, even the people in the movie seem to hate it not realizing what they did, what they accomplished and what they almost accomplished. People say now that this movie is the reason Affleck can't be Batman, but they are wrong, for good and bad, for the experience he got from this movie, for the talent and heart he already gave here, it's obvious he can be Batman. Affleck is strong and the late Clarke Duncan owns the character rightly so, while Farell and Garner are not a strong, they still deliver, Daredevil is a flawed gem, but one that tried to gave it's characters some dept and to run with plots that made sense and to conclusions that are not really that happy, while DC learned from this, Marvel forgot about this as soon as the Avengers project became viable and hence Daredevil remains a much more solid film that Captain America or the Iron sequels which we nonetheless gave more money and rate higher. We should put things into perspective, remember the state of films before the two Fox films of that remote 2003 and thank that year for our eventual 2008 and all of the things that came from that.",Daredevil

This has a far better tone and direction than Sam Rami's Spider-man which i felt lacked something. There are a couple of dumb moments in the film but overall the film delivers on cast, plot, tone and soundtrack.

There are a couple dumb scenes that take you out of the movie and the cgi is pretty dated. However most of the cast does a pretty good job with the roles they are given and the movie does a quick and simple job at telling the origin story.

Ben Afleck does a good job as DareDevil. Unfortunately, the influence of Spiderman required them to include dizzying CGI sequences with impossible Matrix like leaps and movements far beyond the abilities of the DareDevil character or any of the others. Spiderman had SUPER strength while physically, while in great shape and a trained acrobat, DareDevil is still of ""human"" limitations. One doesn't expect reality in a comic book film but they went way beyond any willing suspension of disbelief.DareDevil isn't a terrible film but it isn't exactly a good film either. It was hit and miss, kind of like the Austin Powers movies where there are lines that make you laugh and others that are groaners. With a decent fight choreographer and a director who knows how to stage a proper and coherent action sequence, this could have been another Spiderman. Unfortunately, most of the action scenes are poorly presented and the flaws in internal logic mount up to the breaking point.Catch this one on video/DVD/cable instead of going to the trouble of seeing it at a theater.

Instead, he was just your everyday superstrong, superfast superhero.Worse, though, everyone else in the movie was like a superhero, but we were given no reason why they were so marvelous. For example: Jennifer Garner's character was supposedly just a normal person who had studied martial arts, but she was jumping around and fighting just like Daredevil.It looked awful. The fight scenes were jerky and flashy. The director may have been trying to show us some of the fight through DD's eyes, but enough already.The script was overly contrived. It's one of those movies that's scripted about like professional wrestling -- where the hero appears to be just about dead one moment, but then in peak fighting condition the next. This doesn't happen just once, but several times... IN A ROW.Bullseye really stunk as a bad guy. For god's sake, his ""power"" was that he could throw things accurately! They actually had him turn paper clips into deadly thrown weapons... how lame is that?This is a really bad movie that should never have seen the light of day.",Daredevil

499,RickyMovieMan,"For some, but maybe not everyone.",6,15 February 2003,"Spoiler Alert!! Never reading the comic book ""Daredevil"", I didn't know what to expect from the movie. I did know that it was about a man, Matt Murdock, that could not see, but that didn't matter. All his other senses were enhanced so that he could still function. Makes sense, I think. So, he still could see... in a way. Maybe what I did expect was something unique since this rise of comic books in to movies (i.e. ""Spider-Man"", ""X-Men"", ""Hulk"" and, due out next year, ""Superman"") was making a great show on screen. But, did I feel like ""Daredevil"" packed the right punch?The beginning was a bit shady as we are introduced to Matt Murdock (played well by Ben Affleck) as he falls in to the church, bleeding. There is a strong religious undertone starting with that. We can see that there was something that brought him there. Small memory glances of Elektra (Jennifer Garner) and Bullseye (Colin Farrell)give you the sensation that there was a fight and somebody was hurt. Maybe it was just Daredevil. We don't know yet, but then he goes in to a flashback mode remembering when he was a child and how he came to be who he is now. This part seemed strange to me. The father-son relationship between the young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra) and his father (David Keith) was good. I'm not sure that it was part of the comic book, but I liked this kinship that led Matt in to his dealings with fighting crime. After his senses are tuned in and he has trained to box... Matt faces the bullies that have been on him for a while. He shows them that he's not one to be messed with anymore. There was a moment that bothered me. When Matt does the flip in mid-air to kick one of the boys. I couldn't help but think, ""Where did he learn karate? I thought he was boxing?"" This drew me out of the reality a little bit.Good points- The father-son relationship was very nice. It could have been made distasteful if the father were abusive, but he was not. Of course, the action sequences were wonderful. There were a few times that I thought it was odd. Maybe just because Daredevil could leap from building to building with no problem. He had ultra sensitive senses, not strength. There were some surprises with Elektra's father (Erick Avari) when he died and Elektra did as well. Also, that Daredevil wasn't ""blessed"" but perhaps ""cursed"" with these awesome senses. Too much noise was not a good thing and he had to sleep in water in a sarcophagus to block the noise.Bad points- These are the areas that ""Daredevil"" could have used some fine tuning. The villains were not ""evil"" enough and maybe a bit over-the-top. The prime example of that was Bullseye. He was too wild and crazy. When he killed Elektra's father, he pointed at his own forehead and says, ""Bullseye!"". Yeah, we know who you are. You don't need to tell us. Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) was too busy trying to look sly by smoking his barely lit cigar like he had never done it before. There was never any mystery behind him. The last thing is the love, if you want to call it that, between Matt and Elektra. Too fast and because of that, too unbelievable! It seemed very unrealistic. They met and in the same day they ""tested"" each others skills in the playground. THAT brought me out of the movie a lot! It all of a sudden seemed like it was just Ben and Jennifer showing off. Elektra was suppose to be a good fighter. She held her own with Daredevil and then lost against Bullseye. Then Bullseye was beat by Daredevil. HUH?!In conclusion, I'm sure this movie will do well with the fans and it is a good one to watch, but just once. It was too lacking in a lot of parts, but some people may like that they didn't or did emphasize on parts. It's whatever your flavor, but ""Daredevil"" left me thinking that it was fun to try once, but probably not again. 6/10",Daredevil
500,ahdvd,"Dark and atmospheric, this is a nice translation from comic to film",8,26 December 2003,"I have not read that many of the comic books of Daredevil(Here in the UK, he is not one of the more well known characters like spider-man or Batman), but i had read enough of them to know the character well enough when i heard about this being made, and when hearing Affleck had been cast i was worried as to how it would play.Affleck plays Daredevil/Matt Murdoch as a real character, which works better than expected, he's not a superhero, he's just a hero. He gets hurt, he feels pain, he doesnt come home from being out and hang up his suit and go to bed, ready to wake the next day, he actually suffers the injuries of his alter-ego's crimefighting and suffers the drain it has on his personal life.The film nicely explains the backstory of his character and how he loses his signt and gains his ""radar"" sight(i havent read the early comics so i cant vouch for how faithful this is, but it works really well).Jennifer Garner is good as Electra, although her part could have been fleshed out a little more for my liking, Michael Clarke Duncan is nice as Kingpin (who was originally a white character in the comics, but im glad they did go for him to play the part credibly rather than having a wrestler really ham it up as they originally intended).The real actor to watch out for here though, is Colin Farrell as Bullseye, who obviously had a blast making this film, and his enjoyment of playing this evil character comes accross wonderfully on screen, in particular his very dark and sick sense of humour(one moment with him killing an old woman had me almost in stitches, although it really is quite sick to laugh at).The action scenes are nicely coreographed, but not overly so, and the special effects are very good - for the most part - the ""radar"" view being a delight to see, but sometimes when there are digital characters on screen, it really can detract from the moment. The sound is fantastic, it was good at the cinema, and i have since got the film on DVD and wathced it with the full 5.1 mix in full effect, and it is one of the best sound mixes in a while.It is said that there will be work starting on a sequel, and i hope that if they do, they get the same people to work on it in front of and behind the camera, and keep it as dark and real as they did for the first one.Overall, 8 out of 10 (was going to be a 9, but the bad digital character effects lost it a point)",Daredevil

I was pleasantly surprised with this film, it really had its own feeling and flavor and didn't just use rehash or special effects from other movies, like many today tend to do.The action scenes were unique and amazing in my opinion. The bar scene that is highlighted in a few trailers was fantastic. Also, the use and ways of showing Daredevil's ""radar"" sense was just very, very cool. That's really the best way to describe all of the action of the movie very, very cool.With the actors themselves, all I can say is: WOW! First Ben Affleck (never been a fan of his) was simply perfect for the role of Matt/Daredevil. I really believed he was blind. Jennifer Garner was great as Elektra. She was also great to look at. But ALIAS fans already know this.Michael Clarke Duncan WAS the Kingpin. He really came off as a truly evil, but yet brilliant man as well. Yeah he did seem to have a super-human build and strength, but he does in real life too, doesn't he?And now for Colin Farrel as Bullseye. He was definitely my favorite character.

Thedialogue in this movie was laughable and the characterization was appalling.Colin Farrell's performance was a joke (but he still rules) and the directorseemed to have a fetish for people running up walls and doing backflips. Thefact that a studio was prepared to throw money at such an atrocious screenplay disturbs me.  I wish biohazardous waste would erase the memory of this moviefrom my brain.

The pace was good, the soundtrack worked well, and the characters were developed as needed.  Just try to sit back and enjoy the ride. I'll admit that I haven't stayed current on the Daredevil comic( read it about 15 years ago), but I tend to allow small plot gaps and the occasional lack of consistency to go by relatively unnoticed to just enjoy the rest of the movie, which was actually very good.  I'm lookng forward to seeing a fabled ""R"" rated version that I hope further explores the mature issues that were touched upon in the PG-13 release.  PG-13 is the kiss of death for Action/SciFi flicks.  It would be nice to just see a good action movie that didn't have to cater to the toy industry and the ever growing ""sub-adult"" ( read: 10-15 yr old) crowd that is seemigly the target of most movies made today.  I still can't understand why people raved about Spiderman - who was my favorite comic hero ntil I saw the mediocre movie - and panned this movie.  DD was far more entertaining and probably more believable as well. I think the sequels of these two movies will determine which story line works better in th end.  Once again, it would be nice if they would make one of these movies in the vein of Blade(I) or even the R rated version of Spawn( another victim of the PG-13 kiss of death).

What's wrong with hiring, I don't know, STUNTMEN?!  Worst of all is that somehow Daredevil can leap over ten feet without any assistance from, how do you say, SPECIAL POWERS.  And did Daredevil have to do a backflip every time he left the ground?  They really should have called this Backflip: The Movie.  Also, you've got Colin Farrell, a great actor, spoiting off three word phrases like he's doing a bad Irish Tarzan impression.  And why does DareDevil sleep in a water tank?  That never even got touched upon for the non-comic reader. I was never a big fan of the comic book and I'm even less of a fan now.

Editing was done equally well.  The writing and directing created characters that I could respond to.Some of the fight sequences could have used a bit more, um, hum, `smack'. Although I liked the dirty feel the movie had, it helped create better suspense.I wish I would have seen this one in the theater.  I'd trade my League of Extraordinary Gentlemen theater viewing for Daredevil in a moment.Do I expect any performances, directors, writers, etc to win awards for this?  No, it wasn't that good.  But after being disappointed with some of my recent theater experiences I enjoyed this!",Daredevil
508,leez34,Better than Spider-Man,10,14 February 2003,"Be warned, minor spoilers are ahead.I have never seen a movie that so divided critics.  I've read some reviews that said it was great and lived up to all their expectations, others said it was one of the worst movies they'd ever seen.  I'm not sure what it is about this movie that makes people so at odds, but as far as I'm concerned, Daredevil is one of the good ones.Ben Affleck is adequate in the title role.  Some seams show through at times, as his acting abilities are stretched when he plays someone who isn't an uppity smartass.  He does fine though, and plays it straight the whole way through; there are only a few lines that fall flat when he tries to be sincere.  Jennifer Garner is extraordinary as Elektra, and her chemistry with Matt (Daredevil) saves the movie in some places.  Since a 104 minute action movie doesn't leave a lot of time for our two lovers to get to know each other, their natural chemistry helps the audience believe that Matt truly cares for her despite that they've only been together for a short time.  Michael Clarke Duncan does what he can with his role.  He is physically imposing and acts the part well, but the Kingpin simply doesn't have enough screen time.  Although he's certainly done enough to Matt to warrant his furor at the end of the movie, he's done so mostly behind the scenes and hasn't given the audience much reason to hate him like we do Nurse Ratched at the end of Cuckoo's Nest.  A better way to do it may have been to have Matt confront Kingpin first, saving Bullseye for last, as we get plenty of reasons to hate him.  Colin Farrell is scary and menacing, and steals the show in some spots.  Jon Favreau is the perfect Foggy, and spends a perfect amount of time in the movie.  Joe Pantoliano has very little to do as Ben Urich, and looks nothing like the character, but does a fine job.The CGI effects show at some times, but not nearly as much as Spider-Man. They are used less often and more effectively, especially when we ""see"" the world as Matt does with his radar sense from his intensified hearing. The battle between DD and Bullseye in the street with the motorcycle, while short, is quite spectacular and sets the stage for what Bullseye can do. The origin story is well done and heartfelt, and left me close to tears at times (although that's probably just the fanboy in me).  One complaint from that side is that he doesn't save an old man when he gets blinded by the radiation like in the comics, which I believed was crucial to the character. In this version a swerving forklift swerves into a barrel, spraying radioactive material into his eyes.  Meh.  Other comic-fan-perspective complaints include that DD lets a rapist die at the beginning rather than leaving him for the police, but this does indeed set the stage for an underlying mood in the movie and helps show the character grow, and that Matt fails to stop a crime he hears, opting instead to do the nasty with Elektra.  That may further the romance aspect, but DD should be a stronger hero than that.  The story sticks closely to the comics, and we get to know our hero very well...but as I said, characterization is a distinct problem for Elektra and Kingpin.  Other movies may flesh them out more completely.Daredevil is a basically dark, stylish, well-directed movie.  I can see what the detractors dislike about it, but there is far more to treasure in this one.  The fine action sequences, the character of our hero, and the sharpness of many of the performances far outweigh the faults in this one. I give it *** out of ****.  Compared to other superhero movies:  I say it's better than Spider-Man, although it doesn't give the same kind of a sense of wonder and it doesn't reveal as much about the main character behind the mask.  It is more technically sound and has better scenes of superheroics, while Spider-Man dropped off quite a bit after he donned the costume. It's a little better than Batman, but much more comparable.  I like it more because of how it focuses more on the hero, whereas Batman definitely finds the Joker more interesting than the title character.  The styles are similar.  However, Superman still reigns supreme when it comes to superhero movies.  Talk to me after the Hulk comes out.PS There is an awesome X2 preview before this movie!  It looks even better than the first!PPS Email me if you've seen it - I have something else to say about a particular scene, but I cant talk about it without ruining the movie.",Daredevil

Thats what youll have to be to watch this disaster unfold. Ben Affleck plays the role of a man obsessed with wearing red sunglasses and tight red leather. He faces off against Colin Farell ( who plays the role of ""bullshit"".) The movie is driven by Afflecks desire to destroy Farrel, although it seems Colin insists on killing his career himself. Michael Clark Duncan shows that racial discrimination has ended. They have managed to cast an excellent black actor in a role as horrible as those of his white counterparts. In his spare time Affleck goes around tyring to beat up girls who refuse to tell him their names. Daredevils best defense mechanism is his visual impairment, for he does not have to see this movie. Garners role is a manifestation of the scriptwriters desire to see a woman with chains in leather. Daredevil can ""see"" through his ears.

Since it was a free rental I decided to give it a try, and I must admit, it was better then I expected. I'm not sure if Ben Afleck was the best person to take on the role of the superhero, (I know he's J-lo's hero) but I got carried away with the story, special effects and the beautiful ""Elecktra"", who unfortunately had to die... let's call this an anti-climax.I can understand that this type of movies hasn't been on your wanted list after seeing the batman movies, etc. for some time, but spiderman and this movie sure changed my opinion. It's one 2 watch ;o)",Daredevil
511,hmpxrii,This is going to be fun,1,8 June 2003,"Usually when I have seen a movie I didn't quite like, I still try to respect the author, director, cast, crew and so on because they are at least artists, trying to be creative, and if that fails, who am I to complain? I wouldn't do a better movie all by myself, would I?This one made me wonder.""Daredevil"" is a big-budget Hollywood picture, with experienced actors, probably a well-paid camera crew, make-up department, stylists, prop designers, audio/visual effects crew, and so on, and it is all based on a quite cool comic character. What could go wrong?First thing in this movie that felt wrong was the blind man, jumping around rooftops beating people up with his hi-tech white stick, philosophying about whether he is the bad guy or not, brutally killing rapists, all performed by Ben Affleck dressed up in kinky leather and designer boots.Second thing that felt wrong was that the same blind man, who despite being blind, sees with his ears, apparently better than anyone with eyes. Especially in the dark. And especially when it rains. And especially ... what's the point with a character being blind if he still sees better than anyone else?Third thing is the ""Bullseye"" guy who, for reasons even less explained than the circumstances around the toxic waste accident that made Daredevil blind, has some kind of super powers allowing him to kill just about anyone just by throwing just about anything at him/her, and also getting away with it.Fourth thing was the much too obvious use of supposedly cool music to convince the audience that whatever is now seen on screen is something really cool. Some guitar riffs and a nice pan over New York, to get us in the mood - then we get to see the Daredevil. Some rap/rock music - then the Bullseye guy. Some funky pop music - then the beautiful Elektra. And so on. Like if we are supposed to need a short break, every five minutes or so, from watching the ""acting"" and rest our eyes for a while at some beautiful landscape/city/sky, accompanied relaxing elevator music.The fifth to about the thirtyeth things are all the wonderful Hollywood clichés and rip-offs; a guy getting supernatural powers from toxic waste; a hero that manages to keep fighting despite being stabbed *through* the chest; a few pairs of the kind of boobs that makes poor young girls think they need silicon implants; slow-motion effects (some fast-forward would have been more suitable); a Lara Croft-type heroine (Christ! Why rip off ""Tomb Raider""? It's a guaranteed catastrophe); good-guy-defeats-some-bad-guys-scheme plot; someone's loving father dies; a sex scene in the middle of the movie without any significance in the story whatsoever; vigorous attempts to create taglines (""Stay. Stay with me""); bad guy dies ""Die Hard""-style, falling down from somewhere high, while looking angrily up at the hero; red roses used to create an illusion of symbolism; a big fat bald villain; a bad guy with goatee; climactic fight scene in a church; this movie has it all!I'm afraid I can't say anything rude about the plot, because there is none, and I don't think it would have been anything but confusing to try to incorporate something intelligent or artistic in a flick like this one.If there was a coin in a 200-ton-pile of dung, I wouldn't start digging. Following the same logic, if I missed something worth seeing in this movie, I won't watch it again just to find out what that was either.",Daredevil
512,series_of_moments,Definitely falls short. For hardcore DD fans only.,5,22 July 2005,"I've been a Daredevil fan since I was seven and I liked the movie. I do admit that it was not very good. Trying to avoid any biases, I'll give you my take.The worst parts of the movie were directing and Writing. The movie could have benefited from a much better director. Ang Lee would have been great for this film rather than MSJ. The script forced some of the actors to say lines that were just insufferable. ""I'm not the bad guy"", ""that's the C-Train"", ""Stay. Stay with me."" AAAAAHHHHH!!! No actor should have to say ridiculous lines like that. Due to the slightly low budget, director and the producers the movie also walked a weird line between ultra-CGI Spiderman and non-digital Batman (original). Personally I think that the movie could have been done without excessive digital effects. In the commentary the MSJ admits that the CGI was atrocious at times. Daredevil, in terms of superpowers, is more like Batman than Spiderman and more stuff like the opening fight scene would have been nice.The cast, in my opinion was excellent. There were plenty of moments in the movie that made me believe Ben was a good choice. He performed well in the courtroom as Matt Murdock and at the end against Kingpin. Farell was obnoxious (perfect), Jennifer Garner was solid as Electra, and Michael Clarke-Duncan was the best possible choice for Kingpin. They were good; too bad the script didn't make good use of them. Ben definitely is not the best actor out there, but he could have done well in a better situation.In the end, it was not horrible, but not good either. I saw it a couple times and bought the director's cut (which I recommend. It is better). I try to see the potential in it and kind of gloss over the lame parts but sometimes they're just too bad to ignore. In spite of it all, I'd recommend it to hardcore DD fans because it's cool to see your favorite superhero on screen but I would not recommend it to people looking for a good movie to watch on a Friday night.",Daredevil
513,fouronfour,Decent.,7,22 October 2003,"It's a good movie but its tries too much to copy the style of Batman than to be original. Ben Affleck is ok, and Jennifer Garner is fine as but the real star here is Colin Farrell who is perfect as bullsee.  See it but don't expect to be amazed.",Daredevil

The actions of the caracters are predictable - it´s like seeing a Batman film - you know, what´s gonna happen! I don´t mind that they have started making the Marvel comics into films, but this is riddiculous! X-Men 1 + 2 are the best, Spiderman is okay - but I can´t believe that they make a film which is practicly worthless and now I´ve read that there gonna be a sequal...

Granted, if you're going to watch it for the first time, I recommend watching the Director's Cut. This focuses less on the romance, and more on Matt Murdock/Daredevil; plus, it has a darker feel to it. Personally, I would've done without the Elektra stuff all together (and please, just skip that movie totally...you'll be glad you did). I thought Ben Affleck did well as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, and another solid performance from Michael Clarke Duncan...I wouldn't expect anything less from him. I give it a 7/10, but probably would've made it an 8 or 8.5 if Elektra was out of the movie all together. Recommended.",Daredevil
516,ouimetholmes,A movie that proves people care more for acting than directing,9,30 July 2014,"This movie has my respect for three reasons: 1. Ben Affleck does fit the part for both Daredevil and Matt Murdock. 2. The concept is very much around justice for the common man. 3. Stan Lee has confirmed on a couple interviews that directing was poor and not the acting.I have had many conversations about this movie with many different people fanboys, average movie goers and movie lovers. All do agree that after watching the director's cut they have a whole new outlook on the movie. Before passing judgment; and especially for a Sam Raimi movie give all versions of and a look in between the lines of the movie a try first.",Daredevil
517,BananaKidOfDoom,Screw the original. Watch the Director's Cut.,9,19 March 2005,"I thought the theatrical Daredevil was an acceptable movie. Not really remarkable in any way, but decent entertainment. However, the Director's Cut is remarkable, and great entertainment. The new subplot really explores Matt Murdock's character a lot more, and shows off a lot about his lie-detector skill, which was very minor in the original.Also, many characters get bigger roles. Karen Page plays a very small role, but at least her name is spoken. The Kingpin is great. And Bullseye is still the highlight of the whole movie, even though I will defend Affleck's controversial performance any day.However, the DC features one scene any fan of the comic will recognize. I won't use any spoilers, but it hints at Born Again's story. It's the kind of scene where anybody who reads the comic will wonder why they cut this in the first place.Basically, ignore the original. Get the Director's Cut. My only problems is how they tried too hard to be edgy, with way too much swearing, and one complaint that's solely comic book nerd based. In the scene in Josie's Bar, they don't feature DD wrecking the window. That would have been pretty campy, but still, I would have loved it.If DD2 follows in this one's footsteps, I'll go see it. On opening day.",Daredevil

The Problem with the movie is that when your watching it your gonna think mmmhhh..OK and when its over your gonna feel like ""thats it? thats all?""

520,Fullstack4242,Best Marvel comic book show ever.,10,18 May 2016,"Yea yea i gave it a 10 and I stand by it and here is why. First I will tell you what Daredevil is not. It is not Avengers, Iron Man, Cap America or Flash. What it is a dark, gritty well written show that sticks to source material that has no comedy relief. The actors are not over hyped sex symbol types, they go full force with violence and dark themes. I want more shows like this. I am also a fan of Gotham and Watchmen. I initially did not give it a chance because I tried to sit through an episode of Flash and thought it was similar. After a few friends with similar taste than mine told me DD is different I gave it a shot and I am so hooked I am itching for more. I am delighted show show is successful so hopefully movie and TV writers will finally make real comic book movies and shows. Avengers, Cap America and Iron Man movies make me hurl. Introducing The Punisher was golden, Elektra is awesome, I just love the morbid Church undertones and how each episode does not hold back. I am just so sick of the ""safe"" family fun theme type shows. I swear if I see a Marvel flick on a McCrap ad I wont bother. I know i represent a smaller group but us REAL comic fans deserve the darker themes from source material. It us who took our allowance, min wage earning, birthday money to buy the comic books and keep buying them. We do not deserve so see a half hearted Hollywood version that parents would take their kids to. I do not mind leaving them at home! I am still waiting for an R rated mutant universe flick.......

522,AtomX,Nobody who likes the Daredevil comic book should like this movie,1,13 February 2004,"The main problem with this movie is not the suit, its not Ben Afleck, its the script.  Daredevil's orgin has been rehashed a few times in the comic books, my personal favorite was John Romita Jr.'s rendition.  So I can understand that they wanted to mess around with his origin.  There are several KEY elements to the character that the movie did just not get, and there are more scenes in the movie which just did not play well.  Let me give some examples...Matt was blinded while saving an old man from getting hit by a truck.... not running crying from his Dad.  This is a young act of heroism that was complete ignored by the film for no good reason.Matt in the comic book was once punched by his father... who was terribly grief stricken after doing so, and Matt's faith in his father was shaken. This character building event should have been left in the movie.Matt was trained by Stick to fight against the hand.  When Matt disappoints Stick, Stick leaves.  This mysterious character should have been in the movie... it would have made Matt's marshal arts more believableNow on to dumb stuff IN the movie...The trial scene in the begining was a mockery of the court system.  I can't remember it all that well as I saw the movie once over a year ago, but I do remember thinking that.Matt meets elektra, both in plain clothes and they fight?  For what?  That made NO SENSE!Kingpin while played really well did not show any of the manipulation that he does in the comic.ugh...

Daredevil appears to be the ""bad guy"" trying to do good which is a welcome change from the spidermans and supermans. Although, in typical hollywood style, the story had the makings of being great popcorn cinema, but the writing, acting and directing is quite flawed which leaves the viewer somewhat unsatisfied.

Duncan and Farrell are well below par.While the acting is bad, the script and direction are horid.  The movie is extremely choppy at times and confusing to anyone not familiar with the Daredevil storyline.  The frequent and annoying use of slow motion only further detracts from the movie.I have never been happier to see the closing credits.",Daredevil

I did not like the courting on the playground scene at all.  It looked like dancers counting (1..2..3..flip left..turn..jump) off thier coreography steps instead of the natural ritual it should have been.  Okay, maybe that is what they intended but it wasn't for me.  I liked Jennifer Garner and also I found myself wishing for more screen time for Colin Farrell.   The special effect and stunts were good but not up to the standards I have seen in other top movies.  Finally, the movie had too much dark scenary for me.  Too much dark ruined ""Reign of Fire"" for me.  Again, maybe that is what they intended, but that does not work for me.",Daredevil

But Daredevil is great and it does it in a way where the kiddie over the top stuff was left behind. This movie has better villains, better effects (yes definitely better!) and better love interest. Everything about this movie carried a more realistic feel than Spiderman. The movements of Daredevil were less cartoonish and still very impressive. The story line was great. The backend explanation was good, explaining the whys. The villains were far better than Spiderman, Collin Farrel was fantastic as Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin was perfect casting. Jennifer Garner was delicious. She was smarter, far more beautiful and more interesting. This is at the top of Superhero flicks. As for Ben, I am not a big fan of his work (outside of his cameo's etc in Kevin Smith's flicks) and I feared he was going to ruin this movie. So now I have to give Ben his due. He was just great as Daredevil. He finally pulled one off and I am glad it was here in this movie. GREAT JOB EVERYONE!",Daredevil
527,jhn_morton,Pretty Damm Good,7,3 June 2006,I just watched Daredevil on TV and I have to say that while I went into it not expecting too much I was pleasantly surprised. It was full of action right from the start and the pace never let up for a moment until the end. Admittedly the Daredevil is one of the more minor comic book characters and much of the action and plot could be described as a cross between Batman and Spiderman however if you just disengage your brain and go with it then you'll find an enjoyable little film. I personally think much of the critical panning it received was as a result of anti Ben Affleck backlash rather than on its own merits. All in all I think it merits 7 out of 10.,Daredevil
528,Lord_Drukore,My Thoughts (Minor Spoilers),10,18 February 2003,"First off, I'm sure there are some spelling mistakes, but I don't believe there are any that make my thoughts unreadable.On Valentine's Day the newest comic book adaptation movie was released. Starring Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Collin Farrel, and Micheal Clark Duncan, Daredevil reached the number one spot at the box office. I couldn't be happier. While not a perfect adaptation to the original source (I dare you to find a comic book movie that is a PERFECT adaptation) it was still quite a fun movie. All of the acting was good, but Collin Farrel stole the show as Bullseye (the delightfully evil Irish mercenary who never misses). Initially I had my reservations about Micheal Clark Duncan being cast as Kingpin (since he is a black man playing a character who is white) but he proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he IS Kingpin. The special effects in the movie surpassed the best effects in last year's comic-movie smash hit Spider-Man. Story wise, it's nothing all that special, but it serves it's purpose as an entertaining introduction to the world of the Man Without Fear. As far as the rest of the movie goes, its a dark, grim look into the world of a superhero. This isn't a perfect world. At the end of the day, Matt Murdock/Daredevil does not go home to his perky, peppy elderly caretaker. No, he goes home to a large, dark, empty home where after a hard night's work he pops a vicaden and goes to sleep in a sensory deprivation chamber. It's a miserable life, but one he burdens without complaint in his quest for justice. Despite his extraordinary abilities, he's a very realistic hero in a very real world that just happens to have other extraordinary inhabitants.
A well made movie easily worth paying full admission price to see. ***1/2 out of *****",Daredevil
529,domhimma,very enjoyable - not amazing.,8,25 April 2003,"i really liked this film... i didn't think it necessarily captured the essence of the comic, but i think it was good enough to stand on it's own, it had differences but i thought the differences made it a more enjoyable movie. One of the things i didn't like about the other comic book movies (x-men and spiderman)was that i didn't think they got the back-story narrative and the actual movie story in a ratio that flowed like a film... i thought daredevil nailed it. Ben Affleck did his job well enough, no complaints, but he certainly doesn't make this movie, i've never been a fan of Jennifer Garner but after seeing the film i can't think of anyone better suited for the role... she nails it like a mo'fo'. Joe Pantoliano is always a pleasure to watch and so is Jon Favreau who provides some of the funniest lines i've ever heard in a mainstream film... the mini-basketball scene had me peeing my pants for weeks afterwards. I'd say this film is well worth watching if not for the premise then for the story and the flow and the supporting cast... but there again what the hell do i know.",Daredevil
530,michaeljkraemer,"Recommended, but just barely and only to the genre's fans",5,4 March 2003,"The comicbook probably deserves a better adaptation than this.  Despite a few great action sequences, the movie is fairly dull and should leave many viewers wanting something more, or something different all together.  The film seems to lack any real direction and many holes exist in the plot, a problem which seems to plague these sorts of action features.  The romance feels forced and is poorly paced, making all the time between action set pieces drag to an almost unbearable extent.  Many other elements seem too contrived, too convenient, or too poorly explained.  The lack of any real character development is my greatest issue.  The film just has no heart.
However, there are many good things here, and much of the movie is enjoyable.  Some of those fights are a treat to watch, and the first time Matt experiences his heightened senses and his ""radar"" is absolutely fantastic.  Also, there is some good use of the soundtrack, particularly introducing the villains.  Speaking of the villains, Colin Ferrell, with his full-on crazy portrayal of the psychotic assassin, Bullseye, is just bursting with the kind of energy these films demand from their villains, making all of his scenes fun.Certainly not the worst comicbook movie, although not even close to the level of filmmaking exhibited by Burton in Batman, Raimi in Spider-man, Donner in Superman, or Singer in X-Men, Daredevil winds up in the middle of the road and, while most film fans will want to avoid it, many comicbook fans will enjoy the ride and look forward to sequels, spin-offs and other equally derivative, but sometimes fun, films that choose the familiar course rather than pave a new one.Rated 5 of 10.",Daredevil
531,ncaragorn,No good,3,2 May 2003,"Although it had a great plot, Daredevil definitely wasn't a good movie. It's just not convincible. There are scenes when he is almost dying and then scenes full of action! It had everything to be a very good comic-movie, but it was so poorly planned that the result was a movie in which the story is too big and the details are too few. No good. Maybe director Mark Steven Johnson does a better job in Ghost Rider. I really hope so.",Daredevil
532,simmsneddyman@aol.com,Flawed but good,8,5 May 2003,"Marvel Comics adaptations have not always fared well in the past - for years, DC Comics, through Warners, dominated the adaptation market. Ironically, it took the success of one of Marvel's lesser known characters - Blade - to break Marvels losing streak, and since then, with X Men, Blade 2, and of course, Spider-Man, its been a hot roll ever since.Daredevil looks set to continue that roll, and that in itself is something of a surprise - because this isn't the shinily-dark tone of SpiderMan or even the gravitas of X Men. This is something else altogether - what might be described as the first great Catholic-guilt hero genre piece. Which kinda puts it outside ordinary competition....The central character is Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck)a liberal lawyer blinded by chemicals in his early teens, but left, as a result, with all his other 4 senses greatly enhanced. When his semi-professional boxer father is murdered by shadowy underworld figures for refusing to throw a fight, Matt vows revenge, taking his fathers ring-name as his nom de guerre.So far, so Batman, and to begin with, the brooding imagery and darkened skies suggest that this is going to be a kind of retread of Burtons 1989 film.However, once the film settles down and starts to tell its tale in flashback, something else emerges. For one thing, Bruce Wayne's brooding arose only as a result of witnessing his parents murder - there was never any sense that he questioned his vigilante actions. By contrast, Murdock is still going to confession, still trying to square his legitimate means of dealing with the criminals and low-lifes (his hand-to-mouth existence as a public lawyer) with his nocturnal, non-legitimate means of doing so. This is an issue which ""Batman"" never addressed, apart from elliptically - namely, Wayne could have become a scourge of evil by other means, like Mayor or Chief of Police, but instead, gets dressed up in rubber - but which Daredevil addresses head-on. Or as his priest says - ""you don't want penance - you want permission"". And thats where Murdock ""is"" - caught between what he knows is right and what he feels he has to do. Cut off from the world by his loss of sight (he has to sleep in a sensory-deprivation tank)yet intractably caught up in it all the time by his other enhanced senses,Murdock is, in true Catholic style,in limbo. If he does nothing, he's ruined. If he tries to do something, he's wrong. Essentially - he's damned if he does, and he's damned if he doesn't.This is an interesting idea, and thats a good job because the plot isnt that much to speak of - theres no ""wider peril"" angle as in ""Blade"" or ""Spiderman"" - its an intensely personal battle, on a relatively small scale. For that reason, one of the two key villains - BullsEye, played with a tablespoon of relish and a side order of ham by Colin Farrell - seems in some respects to be in the wrong movie. Yet by that time, it doesn't matter. You're in Murdock's world now.Perhaps the greatest surprise is Ben Affleck. You could think that he'd put some jaw-jutting over as suffering, and try to get by. He doesn't- in fact, he gives a nuanced and clever performance.The single let-down is some of the action sequences, which could have been done better, and which is clearly not the fault of the other actors/characters (Jennifer Garner, Michael Duncan Clarke).However, theres time to improve that with (hopefully) Daredevil 2. It'd be especially impressive if the sequel kept the tone, so that - like Mad Max in the original ""Road Warrior"" film, the final truth remains - that revenge brings no peace, no solace, nothing but a personalised Hell.",Daredevil
533,Brian2887,"Fast-Paced, Highly Stylized Popcorn Flick",9,14 February 2003,"I have been a fan of DD comics for a few years now, so I have been anxiously awaiting this movie's release since Fox first announced it.  Was I disappointed?  Slightly.  The movie is fast-paced to a fault.  Once you manage to grasp what's going on, something new happens that leaves you scratching your head.  From what I've read, 20th Century Fox had Mark Steven Johnson cut out a good half an hour of plot and character development in hopes of fitting in more showtimes a day, thus raising profits.  However, had Fox left in that crucial thirty minutes, I truly feel that this movie would have been truly special.  I certainly hope that Fox releases a Director's Cut DVD to show fans what MSJ really had in mind with this film.That said, I move on to the cast.  Ben Affleck delivered one of his best performances in Daredevil.  You truly believe that he's Matt Murdock.  His character displays soul and emotional layers that have been missing from most other Affleck roles.  Definitely his best acting job since Dogma. Michael Clarke Duncan, while given limited screentime, really shines as Kingpin.  He is ruthless, dark, menacing, and everything else the Kingpin of the comics was.  Garner was a wonderful Elektra, showing more talent in this than in any of her previous roles, including Alias.  However, Colin Farrel's Bullseye truly stole the show.  His hammy, over-the-top performance was perfect in the context of the film.  Honorable mentions to Jon Favreau, Joe Pantoliano, Scott Terra, Leland Orser, and David Keith.  Each portrayed their parts perfectly in the small amounts of time they were given.Mark Steven Johnson does a great job directing his first action movie. His script is crisp and filled with impressive dialogue while his action sequences are hard-hitting, grim, and utterly realistic.  Had he been given that aforementioned half an hour, he would have had a cinematic masterpiece on his hands.  Only one thing truly irked me about his direction, that being the constant New York City overhead shots.  Every transition was a choppily edited zoom across NYC rooftops with blaring rock music.
Had some of the transitions been toned down, the hard rock replaced with Graeme Revell's score, and the extra thirty minutes left in, we would have truly had a cinematic experience rather than an enjoyable popcorn flick. Still, I give it a 9/10 for the effort.",Daredevil
534,Weaver22,better than spider-man,7,9 February 2003,"The world needs another celluloid super hero like Posh Spice needs a diet, but with Marvel Comics bursting at the seams with classic characters, the movie people are virtually queuing up to transform them into big ol dollar signs. This latest effort is based on Daredevil - not as well known as its heavyweight stable mates the Incredible Hulk or Spider-Man, but it will no-doubt bear comparison with them. Like Tim Burton's Batman, there's a heavy dollop of darkness and moral ambiguity about Daredevil but the most striking facet is the humour. It's far funnier (and yet more solemn) than Spider-Man, with the laughs coming in the main from Jon Favreau as Murdock's mate Foggy and the excellent Colin Farrell as villain Bullseye. Affleck (as Murdock/Daredevil) and Jennifer Garner (as Elektra) are suitably good-looking, lithe and earnest in their parts, though J-Lo's better half does appear to be dressed in a red gimp outfit. It's droll, well shot, fast-paced and pretty stylish and while it dodges the moral questions most of the time, a little more grown up than most films of this genre. The only problem with Daredevil is that it follows such a tried and tested formula that maybe, we're all a bit sick of it. He's not an extra-extraordinary character like the Hulk and maybe it's all a tad too soon to be treading this path again.",Daredevil

IT SHOULD BE LONGERif you like action, go see this movie, you will not get disapointed...

536,Mr-KISS,A disappointment.,3,27 March 2003,"It would be interesting to one day see the DVD version of this film and see the many scene's that made the cutting room floor. I dare say if some of those scene's were reintroduced to the film, we would be presented with a film displaying developed characters, developed relationships and a more complete story.That is essentially the idea that one get's when they see Daredevil. It appear's unfinished, as if the budget ran out so they just put on the screen what they had without editing.Daredevil throw's a treasure trove of characters at us, but only really gives us glimpse's of them. Some of the sequences involving Matt Murdock/Daredevil, demonstrate an ability to portray the humaness of the character's and his genuine struggle's his position, however these instances are the exeption not the rule.The character of was never given nearly enough screen time for us to understand his strength's, weaknesses and motivation's. Likewise the relationship between Kingpin and Electra's father was never even remotely explained. Electra's father and Electra also get little screen time together and it is difficult to establish love in there relationship. The role of the reporter was a key figure in the film, however he is never really established and non of his scene's ever portray his importance. He appear's to merely be a prop in the film, there for the sake of it.Colin Farrell was over the top as Bullseye which suited the carelessness that the character of Bullseye was treated with. Affleck was as over the top as Daredevil/Matt however his narration and his scene's did not gel well and his execution was a long way off. Duncan was menacing yet down to earth as Kingpin, but lacked the screen time to really grasp the role and Garner was beautiful as Electra but was reduced to a single dimensional character.My major gripe was with the woeful special effect's. The scene's of Daredevil jumping over building and fighting villan's never really looked genuine. Considering this is first and foremost an action film, it would have really benefitted from smoother execution of special effect's. This is afterall where most of the action takes place.Daredevil had the potential to overtake recent successesful comic book transfer's such as X-Men and Spiderman, however the Hollywood movie making machine has rushed out a product with glimpse's of imagination, but an overall offering of carelessness.",Daredevil
537,Bob_Arctor,"Excellent movie, better than I expected.",10,2 July 2003,"Missed it at the cinema and caught it on DVD. I only wish I'd seen it on the big screen. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and cannot understand why there are so many negative comments. Maybe people see it as a cheap Batman/Spiderman copy rather than the unique character he is.It's not as deep as the original comics but then how can it be with years of material to live up to.All the essentials are there: The origin, the acrobatics, the fights, the costume, Kingpin (who cares if they changed him from white to black, Michael Clark Duncan has so much screen presence I can't imagine anyone else in the role!). Affleck is far better than I expected, giving a real sensitivity to the role and all the supporting cast are excellent too. A special tip of the hat to Colin Farrell as a wonderfully unhinged Bullseye (be sure to keep watching as the credits roll)Shame there little chance of a sequel.",Daredevil
538,Briggity_Brak,Better Than Spider-Man,9,7 August 2003,"That's right, I said ""Better Than Spider-Man,"" and I liked Spider-Man. Spider-Man was fun, but Daredevil was beautiful. Now, I never followed the comic book or anything, so I actually got a lot out of the story. I loved the idea of a lawyer who fights crime and a blind guy who fights with his cane. Also, the acting is fantastic. I love Ben Affleck, and Colin Farrell is the most amazing actor in the world. I don't particularly care for Jennifer Garner, but she wasn't too bad. The effects they used to show Daredevil's sonar ""vision"" were superb. When I saw a clip of the movie that was half ""shadow-world,"" I had my doubts, but in context, it was beautiful. Daredevil is my favorite of the ""comic book movies.""",Daredevil
539,crazyrtrain,"Very sad, very sad",1,8 February 2003,"I read Marvel comics Daredevil as a kid and was horrified by this film adaption. The acting is Terrible! Affleck and Garner are forced to spew out stale one-liners and comedic phrases straight out of sci-fi B movie. Neither of them is even remotely believable in their role. Affleck a superhero? He's far too nervous and ""geeky"" to be the man without fear. As for Garner, she wasn't able to cover her role acting wise. She was also not attractive enough for her role(readers of the comic know what I'm talking about). Overall I think most people unfamiliar with the comic will be lost, people who love the comic will be very unhappy.",Daredevil

As a student nurse we had been learning about catheterising men and women during the day and we needed a proper no-brain formulaic popcorn blockbuster to help us forget the practical session. Hurrah! Daredevil did not disappoint if you wanted to see a film that was similar to (wait for it) Batman, The Crow, Spiderman, ect, ect, ect!! In short, most of the acting is wooden, some of the CGI looked dodgy and frankly the soundtrack was very,very poor. We however loved it as it was a cracking film. Nicely paced, decent fight scenes and the wonderful Jennifer Garner(sigh!!!). If you wanted serious thinking with your films go to see ""The hours"", if you want a rollercoaster of a night, you won't go wrong with the man with no fear.

542,Fury629,Flaws are few and far between; Well worth seeing,8,15 February 2003,"Daredevil is going to be thought of as a spiderman clone by some.  Shame to them.  Daredevil is a journey into the life of another NYC-based superhero, this 1 hour and 35 minute journey being much darker, literally and figuratively.Daredevil centers around blind Matthew Murdock and his quest to get rid of the Kingpin of crime and avenge his father's death.  During the day Matthew is a lawyer trying to bring justice to his clients.  But Matthew has his problems. When a case slips by him he takes matters into his own hands and brings around justice in his own, sometimes grisly, ways.  When he reassures himself that ""I'm not the bad guy"" after killing robbers and henchmen, you wonder if he really isn't all that praiseworthy.  This issue of his image as a man not without faults tends to captivate you and pulls you in to the film.The movie itself, like Spiderman and X-Men (It's fellow Marvel movie kin) feels like a comic book, and the ending sets you up for another episode, just like any comic book serial. The soundtrack is good, including the new Evanescence and stars such as Nickelback.  The action scenes are good and varied in location. But the movie does have its problems and holes here and there.  I think the reporter subplot wasn't explored enough, and the threat of Daredevil being revealed didn't feel dangerous considering it was pushed on the backburner.  Jennifer Garner, though a beautiful stage presence, fell flat and hard without much emotion.  Some of the things Ben Affleck said sounded like he read them straight off movie poster taglines (`I hope justice is found before justice finds you' and `Justice is blind'), and some of the subtle jokes do fall flat.",Daredevil

Ben Affleck, who is not a good actor, did really a decent job in it. Sure, he is not an oscar winner, but I really believed he IS Matt Murdock. Jennifer Garner did the same. The movie looks Tim Burton's batman, even if he isn't as good as batman returns. Unfortunatelly, there are some cheesy points, expecially in the end of the movie. ( spoilers )For exemple, Daredevil, near of the death, recovers his health and defeat bullseye. That's stupid !

Elektra is beautiful and Ben does a fine job as Daredevil! I know a 10 may be a bit much to give this movie but I love the comic book and I want to see more Daredevil movies in the future. (Not that my vote on IMDB will cause that to happen).  People just do not know enough about Daredevil so this movie gave them a part of who he is--and I like that a lot.  Most people just know about Superman, Spiderman, and Batman and as great as they are they are not the kind of hero that Daredevil is.  Daredevil speaks to an older audience, he is searching to find his place even though he may have ""super powers."" He gets hurt and becomes confused at times and that is what makes his character unique! I might have changed the fact that Daredevil let the guy die in the beginning of the movie; that is totally out of line of who Dardevil is.  But hey it is a movie.  Not the best movie ever but they did well with it and stuck to the story and for that they should be praised! Very cool!",Daredevil

Daredevil has it all, insane action, brilliant fighting and a sinister plot. it includes a good cast (although i wouldn't say Ben Affleck is a good Daredevil) Jennifer Grner and Micheal Clark Duncan have very persuasive acting, but it wasn't a clever idea having a Black Kingpin, because if you haven't read the comics, which you should have, clearly he is white. it lacks the Darkness and Thrill of The Dark Knight, and the Colourful and tangtilizing speech of Thor but in all this is a seriously cool and devious Superhero film that i erge any comic book fan or lover of the big screen to see.",Daredevil
547,blondofborg,Everything just flaws into place....,8,18 September 2004,"And no that's not a mis-typed title. Daredevil is a highly entertaining and criminally under-appreciated piece of blockbuster trash! Really, it is the unintentional laugh in the face all comic book conversions have had coming for years. This film is a terrific tribute and parody of the genre, including campy, over the top performances, a silly, cliché-laden script and plenty of visual and sonic candy to boot. If it sounds like a perfect recipe for seriously bad cinema, you're not far wrong.The main reason it works is the sheer fun the entire cast (and by the looks of it, production team) had with the project. Affleck and Garner chew up the scenery nicely and know where to stop, never taking their roles too seriously. Colin Farrell on the other hand, goes WAY over the top, hamming it up for Bullseye like few performers in recent history. Okay, another Nicholson's Joker he may not be, but in a depressingly underwritten and two dimensional character, Farrell gives his all and is simply a joy to watch on screen. Ultimately that's the main reason Daredevil works. While Spiderman and X-Men pulled off the impressive task of combining emotional and social depth with their high octane comic action, Daredevil abandons any pretensions to legitimacy early on. Had it tried to take itself seriously it would have fallen badly, but taken as it is, with the cast content to act the goat to create an entertaining movie, it's a hell of a lot of fun. Daredevil is a genuinely awful movie if taken seriously, but if you take it the way the cast have, expecting campy, clichéd, comic capers aplenty, you'll have almost as much fun as they did.",Daredevil

Ben Affleck was OK for the role as Matt Murdock/Daredevil but I thought that the lovely Jennifer Garner was wooden. Duncan was good as the Kingpin but I thought that Colin Farrell was the best one in the film for making Bullseye so unpredictable and insane.

Forget Spider-man with its colorful character swinging through the streets of new york. Forget Batman with it's dark brooding character and over the top comic to film transition. In half of the batman movies I half expected Wham Kasplat or kazump to show up in the middle of a fight scene. But this isn't about Batman, or spider-man for that matter. This is about Dare devil. A super hero that most people have never even heard of. Which is one of the reason's why it didn't do as good at the box office as it should have done. Which in hindsight this is a shame as some people out there are missing a great film. Right from the start we are drawn into the story by meeting a beaten up Ben Afflick in the title role. We then hear him say the immortal line ""they say that when you are about to die you see your whole life flash before your eye's. That is also true of a blind man"" And then of course we are taken to back to when the hero of the film was a normal boy growing up in a part of new york called hells kitchen. An origin story that to my mind hasn't been implemented as well in any other movie. The film doesn't let up from that moment either, and if superhero's existed they would exist in the form of dare devil. The scene where Mat Murdock return's home after dispensing of a really nasty rapist is masterful. Beaten and bruised he steps in the shower, and as the water trickles over his battered body you can see the blood trickling down the drain, then cut to his face as he pinches a single tooth that comes away from his jaw then clunks to the bottom of the shower with a ching. Then after stepping out we see him go straight to the medicine cabinet and pop some painkillers into his mouth. Then after stepping into his sound proof coffin so that he will not go mad from the high intensity sounds he is constantly hearing, he passes into something slightly less pleasurable than sleep. You know at this point that this is a super hero. There is no Aunt May or butler Alfred at home to cook him a nice cup of tea. He is completely alone. Doing what he does not to get thanks. But because he has the ability to do it. I don't even class this movie as a movie. This move is pure Art. Made and written by people that love the whole daredevil mythos. The man without fear. And to all those people that hated the movie I am sorry. I am sorry that the film hasn't got the recognition that it deserve's and i am sorry that everyone who hated the film so much hasn't really watched the film.

551,giantcomics101,Note Quite What I Was Expecting,2,22 March 2008,"Movies inspired by super-hero comic books have been hit and miss. Unfortunately, the Marvel Universe has had more misses than hits, and DAREDEVIL is a huge disappointment. Everything about this movie is wrong. It deviates way too much from the comic, and there is absolutely no chemistry between Daredevil and Elektra. It looks as if everyone simply phoned in their performances. Colin's performance is decent, but he's a far cry from the Bullseye of the comics. The direction is choppy, the action sequences are over-the-top in all the wrong places, and the soundtrack is trite. Daredevil's costume looks silly. In comic books, artists can really exaggerate the look of the character; it becomes stylized and slick or dark and moody. Miller, Mazzuchelli, and Sale are masters at this. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do with the costume on film. It is what it is, and in the case of Daredevil, it just looks shiny and silly. If you're looking for an enjoyable super-hero movie, try BATMAN RETURNS, X-MEN 2, OR SPIDER-MAN 2. They all succeed so well. The DAREDEVIL film crew should have watched this movies a few times before the first day of shooting.",Daredevil

Cox is so vulnerable yet gifted and becomes a fully developed human - not a toy hero doll. I don't think Affleck should do superheroes.

The most ridiculous aspect of this film is the voice-over which affleck does in a completely different tone to the way he portrays his character in the rest of the film; it's like they got him out of bed early and didn't let him clear his throat before shoving him in the voice-over booth.

554,Talison,Everything I wanted in a comic book movie (Possible Spoilers),9,20 February 2003,"I have been a comic book fan for most of my life, as well as a general sci-fi fan. Daredevil has never been a book I have read regularly, but I was familiar with the character.Going in to the movie I really didn't think it looked that good. In fact, until I saw the HBO special I almost wasn't going to go.But I went. And I'm glad I did.As a comic fan I was very impressed. Right off the bat I noticed the film makers didn't try to put a larger than life Superhero into a realistic world. They seemed to go with what works in the comics, with comic book style physics. Daredevil moved acrobatic and fluid, not stiff and mechanical as was the case in the Batman movies. Bullseye was maniacal and over the top. Elektra was graceful, but was still portrayed as inexperienced with only school training.The casting was mostly spot on. I have been wanting to see Ben Affleck as Batman for sometime. He proved my faith in him by pulling off this similar character. Collin Farrel pulled of a sinister Bullseye that made me forget his costume had been completely changed. Duncan also makes us forget that his skin color may not match his comic book counterpart. He plays The Kingpin exactly as he should have been played. Garner doesn't really look the part of Elektra, but she pulls it off better than expected.And little things made this movie better than expected. I loved that Daredevil's back was scarred from his adventures, and that his eyes were scarred from his accident. It was great to see that he was depressed by the life he had chosen, but knew it was what he had to do. He did it willingly, but coped with painkillers and trying to good in his everyday life.The fact that he slept in a sensory deprivation tank was a particularly nice touch.But it was the well written script, the high action plot, and the great action that makes this movie. Bullseye's fight with Daredevil in the church was probably the best comic book style fight scene ever made. The close ups and rotating cmera shots just made it better. It wasn't realistic, or even the imitation of extreme realism like Crouching Tiger, it was like watching a living comic.The radar sence was just as I always pictured it. All the billy club tricks were there. The hero actually changed his voice while in costume. And unlike the Batman films, the hero did not go home to the girl in the end or unessisarily kill the villain.This was a comic come to life, and I think it was aimed at comic fans. At the very least it doesn't try to change what isn't broken in the comics.It's not Superman or the first Batman. It's not as good as Spider-Man.",Daredevil
555,Chuck-156,Not nearly enough character development,5,16 February 2003,"One of the things that made X-Men and Spiderman such good movies, as well as big hits, was that each spent an extrordinary amount of time developing their characters. That paid off big-time later in the film when we needed to care about them. This is where Daredevil falls apart. Who is Electra and why is she so angry? Is her father a good guy or bad guy? Why does the reporter care about Daredevil/Murdock? Does Kingpin need to be a cardboard cut-out who just laughs and puffs menacingly on a cigar?This could have been such a good film. Daredevil is a dark, multi-layered figure that seemed like a perfect vehicle to build a story around (ala Spidey or Batman). They came up way short on this one though....",Daredevil

Now that I've got that out of my system (until the next stupid movie that decides to use this worthless device)...(I was blown away when I got to see the trailers for Kill Bill and X-Men 2 for the first time. X-Men 2 is, of course, looking, like, totally awesome. I am not a Quentin Tarantino fan, per se, so when I tell you that the trailer for Kill Bill was amazing, you know it really was. Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu waving swords and throwing Fu looks to be spectacular.)Then the movie started...and one more time I have to mention the flash-forward/flash-back device is no good. As a fan boy, I enjoyed the movie thanks to some cool effects, quality Fu and a few inside jokes but I will have to be honest and say that it was maybe as good as Batman Returns...maybe. Only Jennifer Garner had it lucky with a combination of quality acting and correct casting. Ben Affleck is not Matt Murdock. He's not dark enough or even believable when he's trying to be 'conflicted', and Michael Clarke Duncan (who is usually a fine actor) was flat and uninteresting as Kingpin. Collin Farrell rescues a potentially damaging role by throwing himself into the part, but is ultimately let down by the writing and directing.I can't stop you from seeing this movie and I wouldn't try to. However, I'm sure we can commiserate about what ""could-have-been"" after you're done.",Daredevil
558,EZC X,"If you love the comics, you'll love this movie.",6,15 February 2003,"Daredevil, which is getting predictably trashed by critics and cynical theatergoers is really impossible for them to review.  If you have read the comics in the past and disliked them, you won't like this movie.  If you have no idea about the comic book or the characters, you could go either way, hating it or just taking it as a decent action movie.  But if you're a fan of the comic, chances are you'll really enjoy the movie.Director Mark Stephen Johnson is a fan.  It's obvious from the beginning to the end of his script.  There is influence there from all the great writers of the comic, from Stan Lee (Who makes a cameo) to Frank Miller, all the way up to Kevin Smith (Who also makes a cameo).  Daredevil does not have the broad appeal of Spider-Man or Superman and the script is very dark, probably more so than the original Batman.  Daredevil is a tortured character, frustrated by being unable to convict criminals as a lawyer, so he takes it out on them at night, using his heightened abilities and unique ""radar sense.""  That particular aspect is very well done, very much like Brian Michael Bendis does in the recent comics.  Speaking of Bendis, his name pops up as a character name as does former Daredevil artists and writers Quesada, Miller, Mack and other Marvel mainstays like Jack Kirby and John Romita. Even some of the visuals are taken directly from the comics such as the opening shot and (*****POSSIBLE SPOILER, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK*****)perhaps the most famous image from the comics, I won't say exactly what, but there's a good chance you can figure it out. (*****END SPOILER*****)All of the actors really nailed their roles.  Daredevil himself was nicely played by Ben Affleck, but where he really shines is in his role as his alter ego, Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer.  Affleck really studied for his role as a blind man and he pulls it off nicely.  Jennifer Garner is beautiful and graceful in her roll as Elektra.  Both leads have good chemistry and the dynamic of their relationship is captured perfectly on the screen.As good as the heroes are, the villains may be even better.  Michael Clarke Duncan IS the Kingpin.  Any gripes about changing the ethnicity should be squashed after seeing him in the role.  No other actor has the physical presence that the character needs and Duncan steps into the role effortlessly.  But probably the most liberties where taken with the character Bullseye.  The costume from the comics is replaced by a bullseye carved into the villain's forehead and Colin Farrel was allowed to speak with his native Irish accent.  But his portrayal of the psychopath is flawless and you can really begin to see how he's being hyped as Hollywood's ""next big thing.""As for the supporting characters, Jon Favreau is hilarious as Foggy and Joe Pantoliano does a good job as tenacious reporter Ben Urich, who is used sparingly throughout the film.My only gripe with the movie would be that it seems to unbelievable to have Daredevil, Elektra and Bullseye jumping thirty feet in the air from rooftop to rooftop like Spider-Man.  That's never the way I saw them, flying around while fighting.  But it's a nit-picking complaint and really doesn't take away from the movie.All in all, Director Johnson and the actors bring the characters to life perfectly and the film is full of dark atmosphere, humor and action.
As I said earlier, if you don't like or have no opinion of the characters, you may be better off with a movie like Spider-Man with broader appeal. If you do like the character, however, you'll find a lot to like in Daredevil.",Daredevil
559,Weshubb,"Enjoyable, but definitely needs work...",7,4 December 2003,"The story was faithful in terms of the feel and likeness of the character, and was definitely done in a fashion that almost mirrored Spiderman. The difference with this film is the darker tone that was used to establish the nature of film, and unlike Spiderman, Daredevil was a bit more action oriented than story driven.SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!The one factor that is left out is the back history of how Matt learned his incredible fighting skill. The film does briefly explore him learning his potential, but left out the important factor of his training to hone his incredible senses. Someone could have trained him to be a better fighter than what was shown in the film. Being faithful to the comic, Daredevil was trained by Stick in the comic series as a child to teenage years (after the death of Matt's father)...that to me would have been very important in the opening portion of the film. Even if it only explored that option for a 2-3 minutes, but over all the choices in the film in this writer's opinion were good to excellent. To do different things to the characters (example: making Kingpin an African-American character)was a definitely a creative and different choice than the traditional comic version. Kudos to the casting director, and director for the choices that were made.Overall, I believe the film could have explored more of the back history of the character, which I believe would have made a better film. Leaving out elements, can sometimes hurt a film. This was apparent in this film. As far as ratings go...Out of 5 stars: It gets 3.5 out of 5 for content, and entertainment value.",Daredevil

If we ask them why do you do this job, they say as an answer, we want to make much money. And they are right. What they must do is making money. If they don't, we don't have any chance to see greater movies and other productions. But in practice they can have some blur in their eyes. While showing DD Director's Cut in theaters, we have to enjoy it at homes. This movie was done as well as Spiderman or Xmen were. The script is even better than them.

It is utter balls. It is a complete mess. The editing is off the rails, cut scene here, cut scene there and before you know it, your dizzy. There seems to be no consistent scenes. The acting is the worst i have ever seen.It doesn't even look good. The opening titles, although desperately trying to be original are really drawn out, or feel it. ANd who the hell is this preist guy that he keeps going to. I think there was a second at the start when he picks him up.Frankly i expected better from Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farell, Ben Affleck it was nothing new. He doesn;t look like a superhero. He comes across as super dork, especially when fighting Jennifer garner in the park, who may aswell have been a cardboard cutout on screen. In fact it would have been more fun if they shot the whole thing using lego.This film males Lost In Space look like The Godfather. The only credible bit in thw hole film is the kevin Smith cameo, who is no doubt thinking, ""Why the f*ck did i say yes?"" Probably because of Affleck.Who wrote the damn script. It is sooooooooooo bad. The it stinks of old cheese. The only thing that i can deduce from watching the film is that the director is a hughly skilled boll*ck juggler.This film absolutley sucks.

564,DrachanUK,"""How to make a comic book adaptation for the fans. Step One""",10,19 February 2003,"""Wow."" That was my impression after seeing this movie. I have not read the Daredevil comics, nor do I plan to as Marvel have never ""floated my boat"" as a comicbook style, yet this movie was without doubt my movie of the year so far. Taking the generic superhero plotline of ""disadvantaged kid receives a mixed blessing and uses it to the greater good"" (no, fools, it's not a direct spiderman rip-off, it's a comic cliché, live with it) and a typical Stan Lee style storyline (That's not a spiderman rip-off either, unless you beleive the guy rips off his own comics.. and that's plain daft.) Mark Steven Johnson has created a very impressive movie. Visually quite a masterpiece considering the smaller budget. Aurally superb (the soundtrack is amazing, watch out for Evanescence's future rise into popularity!)O.K. so the movie does ""borrow"" from earlier examples, images are noticeable from ""The Crow"" and yes, some of Daredevil's movements are similar to Spidey, but let's face it.. ""The Crow"" was an impressive piece of work (any homage cannot really be faulted,) and Spiderman was not original, just relatively original in a movie format.Also worth bearing in mind how long these comic books have been ""in production."" Daredevil was originally planned as a much smaller, dark and gritty, almost arthouse movie. It *has* suffered by the success of Spiderman for one reason: Spiderman's success pushed the producers of Daredevil to want the movie as a more commercial venture.. ""More Hollywood."" Thank the Gods that they didn't fully get their way.Daredevil takes risks and liberties, just like any movie does. It has inspiration in earlier productions, yet I'd be inclined to say it's no more a rip-off of Spiderman as ""A Time to Kill"" is a rip off of ""The Client"" or ""The Pelican Brief.""Enjoy the best of the Superhero adaptations whilst you can, whilst they're being made by the fans for the fans. If the Hollywood engine firmly takes hold of this idea (any future productions after Hulk) for coporate reasons, we could be for a long downward struggle.Go see Daredevil if you're looking for a dark, gritty, enjoyable comic book romp with some hillarious moments. Don't go see it if you think Spiderman was original and the best thing on the planet, go read some Comics first and get an understanding of why Daredevil and Spidey will always be similar. Even in book form.Also, watch out for a couple of exciting cameos!",Daredevil
565,jreddish,Gigli couldn't have been this bad,1,28 February 2004,"The good news for Ben Affleck is that Gigli couldn't have been the worst movie of the past year. I almost wanted to cry for Colin Farrell and Joe Pantoliano after seeing this complete piece of trash. The dialogue was not ""comic book authentic"" or however it has been excused, it was just horrible. This movie had no redeeming quality whatsoever. Colin Farrell was reduced to a series of grunts. The logical fallacies of this movie exceeded Double Jeopardy, and that is saying something. Poor Jennifer Garner is a better action actress than to have to be imported into blockbuster (which is different from straight to Blockbuster, which this should have been) simply to provide some kind of sex appeal. I will admit that my friends and I laughed harder during Daredevil than in any movie we have seen in recent memory.",Daredevil

It was better than Spidey.",Daredevil
567,i_shant,Better than your average comic book movie. (Just as generic as your average one-line summary),7,14 February 2003,"The only thing that kept my hope alive for Daredevil the movie, aside from my love for Frank Miller and John Romita, Jr. era Daredevil, was the writer/director status of Mark Steven Johnson, and how hard he fought to direct his own script.  Other than that, I expected to be disappointed (more underwhelmed) just as I had with Spider-Man and X-Men.  And while Daredevil is better than those two, it's not quite a step in the right direction.  This is still a first installment as opposed to a successfully interesting movie, in of itself.   But that's a lot to ask from a Hollywood movie of this magnitude, so why be pessimistic in a war that can't be won? X-Men suffered from a lack of character focus (Wolverine got the most screen time, but aside from barely learning about the evils of the Canadian government (what is up with that, anyway? Canada's responsible?) his character hardly develops.)  Matt Murdock/Daredevil, however, is the only character Mark Steven Johnson seems to care about.  Does this justify rendering all other characters with tacked-to-the-wall-and-squirming development? No.  The Kingpin, Elektra, and the stupidly-attired Bullseye all enter Daredevil's life from tangents, and while his direction may have changed from beginning to end, and he may have ""saved himself,"" the integrity of the characters would have improved had Johnson allowed any of them to run parallel to Daredevil for more than a moment.  It might also have helped the audience give a crap about them, and heightened their threat.  The Kingpin and Bullseye only seem threatening because we're told they're evil; killing a guy in a bar fight is a w**ky thing to do, but hardly Evil.  On the plus side, Ben Affleck did not suck.  He was my greatest reservation about this movie, but, as opposed to Spider-Man and all of the X-Men, Affleck looked comfortable in the suit, making for a believable hero. The inner-conflict Daredevil deals with regarding the appropriate extent of justice throughout the movie--does a hero kill?--sustains the mortality usually associated with character, and that's good. The plot was less formulaic than expected--even beyond ""the sad part"" every Daredevil fan should know is bound to happen--giving a fine balance to the entire film.  Johnson has created a strong and interesting protagonist, able to survive in a climate of blockbuster sequels.  It's just a climate that sucks.",Daredevil

THAT comparison made me hate it like hell. The script was cheesy and clichéd, and the ""intros"" for each character with background music and larger-than-life acting resulted in me denouncing it as a piece of utterly crappy film-making. Ben Affleck was as usual boring and wooden, while Colin Farell was crazy, neurotic and had a sickening costume redesign to look like a biker instead of an assassin. The ""can turn anything into a weapon"" gimmick was impressive at first but using PENCILS beggars belief. It was short, a relief as if it had continued in that vein I'd have broken the TV.

A ""love interest"" that consumes all of four minutes of screen time, and makes no pretense at trying to convince the audience that these people have reasons to be interested in each otherBasically, the sparring scene in the playground between Ben and Jennifer was fun.  My advice?  If you MUST go (and you really shouldn't), leave after that, your hopes that the movie might improve, or at least stay at that level, will be cruelly dashed.

It showed his blindness in a way we could understand. Jennifer Garner also proved her acting abilities and was very dynamic. Her character was similar to the TV show character she plays on Alias, which I thought was interesting. All in all, you won't walk away from this thinking it was better than Spiderman. It wasn't, but you can find me buying this one on DVD.",Daredevil
575,Nameless1138,Justice was served,5,17 March 2003,"I have been waiting for this movie since I first saw the teaser with Minority Report.  In fact I built up such high expectations, that I expected to be completely disappointed when the film came out on the 14th of February.  When I finally got to see it was very, very happy with the end result.  The main thing I loved about this film as opposed to other superhero films was the fact that it concentrated so much on the star of the film.  Rather than giving the bad guy half the film, or just making the bad guy even more fun then the superhero.  With films like Batman and Spider-man they gave so much screen time to the bad guys, that you never really fully understand the personal struggles of the superhero.  You get a general sense of it, but you never see the down side to it as you do in Daredevil. Especially in one seen when Matt Murdock returns home after fighting crime that night.  Spider-man and Batman could have completely avoided using the ""main"" characters name in the title and gotten away with it.  Where as in Daredevil the film gives enough screen time to Bullseye and The Kingpin to the point where you understand what and why they are, but you are not overly saturated with it.  The bad guys are just simply, the bad guys.Other things that I appreciated about the film was that I thought the action scenes were well done.  It was fun to watch Daredevil ""serve justice"" to a ton of guys in biker bar in a matter of minutes.  The action scenes made sense except for the fact that Daredevil always seemed to have 2 sticks even though he would lose them or throw one at someone else but then magically it would return to his hand.  He literally can create a baton when he accidently loses one.  I enjoyed the romantic chemistry between Affleck and Garner.  The love story wasn't as poorly written as say Attack of the Clones, and it was fun to watch them interact with one another.  Affleck to me was everything Murdock was in the comic books.  He was as much as Murdock as Christopher Reeve was Clark Kent/Superman.  I like Garner as Elektra, she was definitely sexy and she got a chance to show off some of her moves as Elektra.  I really liked Colin Farrell as Bullseye, he was about as over the top as you can get, and I thought it played perfectly for what the character represented.  Michael Clarke Duncan was perfect for the Kingpin, he was all powerful, imposing to all those around him, and you could see that he enjoyed being this God-like character.  Also Jon Favreau was very funny as Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson, and Joe Pantoliano was good as always, although I wish his part would have been a little bigger.All in all I thought the film was well written, well directed, and well acted.  I think if your looking for 2 hours of afternoon fun this is definitely what the Dr. Strom ordered.  For those who are fans of comic films I think they'll love it, and for those who don't I think they'll also have a good time at the theater.  I read the comics as a child and still do and I thought this was a great adaptation.  In my opinion the second best thus far, second only to Superman, although Spider-man was damn good, as was X-men, Batman, and Blade.  Although Captain America, was not.On a side note to the comic fans look for all the references to those who worked on the comic such as Frank Miller, Kevin Smith, Jack Kirby, John Romita, Stan Lee (of course), and the list goes on. 10 out 10 for me, just because I enjoyed it so damn much, now if only they can release the R-Rated version onto DVD now.",Daredevil
576,XOXOgrI44,sorely disappointing..,4,3 April 2003,"(a bit of a spoiler, don't worry, its very slight)There used to be a time, where comics were confined strictly to the page. Nowadays, comic books get the royal treatment, with big movie-sized budgets, martial art choreography, to top of the line CGI special effects.I think it's very closed minded for people to go away and say that this was a 'good' movie, and to ask, 'what was wrong with it?'  Either it was all the hype around the movie, or the hoopla surrounding comic book movies nowadays (especially post-spiderman), or were too distracted by its A-list cast to notice a plot with holes in it big enough to drive trucks through.
I honestly WAS looking forward to daredevil when it came out, and i did go see it on the very first day it came out in theaters.  I had a friend who saw it earlier that day, and he had told me that the movie was horrible, and the fact that I hadn't seen it yet, couldn't comprehend why.
He told me that the whole movie felt 'rushed'; that it felt like it was something that was quickly done to get out of the way.  and I wondered, how does a movie feel rushed??  when i saw it for the first time, i finally got what he was saying: i.e., Colin Farrell maybe gets 10 lines in the whole movie, Michael Clarke Duncan is in the movie maybe half an hour. To me, the only convincing person in the whole movie, was Jennifer Garner; where she's pretty much reduced to window dressing, and she literally fights for two minutes and it's over.  (no comment to as how the fight ends)honestly usually i'm a fan of ben affleck (and especially the rest of the cast), but i think the lack of time they had on this movie really shows. Throughout the whole movie, he seems confused between how he should really act as a blind man, to the point where he seems to waver between being awake and half asleep.  I think this is a point beyond typecasting, where your lack of skills really show.and with the plot holes!  I have never seen such a movie that has had made such a lack of sense.  of one of the few, i found it interesting to see a person who is supposed to blind, (besides the heightening of the other senses, he's just a regular human being) do martial arts as a kid almost completely out of nowhere, and almost fly through the air amongst new york's skyscrapers.never have i seen such a credible cast being wasted, with some of them being award winners.  it's really sad, because if they had invested more time in the movie, (instead of throwing money at it for special effects) it could have been a really cool action/comic book movie that makes sense.  Right now, its caliber is below X-MEN, but slightly above Batman and Robin.
Don't waste your money on this movie.  When i saw it for the 2nd time, i found it unbearable to sit through.  All this movie really is, is shallow popcorn fluff.",Daredevil
577,keiranww-1,Gothic glory,10,10 April 2003,"This is a marvelous movie, fine acting, assured and attentive directing and a passionate cast-Ben Affleck as Daredevil-and a good eye for detail. The first superhero movie to show a superhero in real pain (painkillers) since Batman.The gothic feel lends an air of authenticity to the roots of the comic book.
When the main character Matt Murdock is a child he sees an unsavory sight with his father, he cycles away on his bike to have his sight taken away by a toxic substance....But instead of just losing his sight he gains another sense, a kind of sonar hearing that allows him to use sound instead of sight to ""see"". This heightens his awareness of the world around him and when his father is killed swears to give justice back to ""Hells kitchen"". He trains himself to become aware of all that is around him and boosts his physical strength.Anyway, he eventually becomes a lawyer and when he is not fighting crime in the courts he is exacting justice on low-lives in the streets as Daredevil.When, due to his success in attacking the Kingpins (Michael Clarke Duncan)henchmen sends for the worlds top assassin Bullseye (an excellent Colin Farrel). In all of this Daredevil falls in love with the stunning and dangerous Elektra (Jennifer Garner). When her father is assassinated by Bullseye she blames Daredevil and she sets out to exact justice.
In all of her searches she falls for Daredevil, while training herself rigorously for the fight with Daredevil. A wonderfully human moment happens where Daredevil has to choose between sleeping with the woman he is falling for or save an anonymous life, who he does not know and is probably a scumbag - so what does he do- the human thing.The final fight-scene is well choreographed (as are all the fights), although the CGI climbing the church was as poor as that of Spiderman swinging on his rope.A brilliant movie, see it or miss out on the best comic book film since the Crow.",Daredevil

I was not a huge fan of the X-Men movie but at least that had excellent casting and acting.  Towards the end it just gets ridiculous and I couldn't wait for it to end.  Please do not make a sequel!  Any kind of explanation for who or what exactly Bullseye was would also have been appreciated in the movie.

580,Thunder_godess,"Underrated, Look to the heart",10,16 February 2003,"If i hear one more person compare Daredevil to Spiderman i will scream. I had high expectations for Daredevil ever since it was announced, and i wasn't disappointed. I took three of my friends yesterday to see it, who all went saying they didn't want to go and that it was a waste of our precious teenager money and that it looked crappy, and they all came out singing its praises. Maybe it wasn't a mirror image of the comic book and maybe there were a few inconsistancies in the plot, but when people who were aversed to the very idea of seeing it come out talking about how brilliant and entertaining it was, that is what you need to notice. You cannot adapt a comic to screen flawlessly because it would not work, things that people will accept on 2D paper with words like (biff!) and (pow!) in little bubbles when someone punches someone just doesnt fly on the silver screen. Have we forgotten the cheesy, pun- filled Batman and Robin of a few years ago? The inconsistancies of recent comic book movies.I feel sorry that Spiderman came out before Daredevil, especially as DD has been planned since the early 1990's, if Daredevil came first, Spidey would be the weak comparison, but with all comic book movies those that come before are seen as the line that all that follow strive to attain. People are so busy checking for flaws in DD that they dont look to the heart of the movie, a man who has lost faith in what hes fighting for, with all the scars on his back, popping painkillers and trying to make a difference. It's the gritty truth of what being a superhero is all about. Its not always about leaping from buildings squealing like a little girl because you can shoot goo from your wrists and have suddenly transformed into an uberhunk with pretty powers and a colourful costume. Daredevil shows the dregs of humanity and the real criminals out there, not the beefed up supervillains in camp costumes. The fact that rapists and murderers and muggers do get away with literally murder, that justice does fail and people who should be locked up walk free all adds realism and mirrors all that is wrong with the world.
Maybe everyone who sees Daredevil can't see that, can't understand the issues at the heart of it and will only see a superstar engine for the lovely Ben Affleck to kick some ass and dress in a silly outfit, but thats your loss. Its a movie about regaining your faith and remembering there are still things worth fighting for, and i only hope all comic book movies can someday grasp what being a true hero is all about. I recommend everyone should go and see it, and make up their own minds. The performances weren't always as great as expected but that can be attributed to flaws in the plot, the camera angles were sometimes stomach turning, but that can happen in even the greatest movies. For a movie of only 102 minutes it delivers what it says, and like X-Men i think the first movie feels like a very expensive trailer for the second which thankfully is inevitable as long as the movie does well.Showing the vunerablility of a blind 'superhero' who isnt made of steel, who can be hurt and does feel the pains of humanity, who is fighting a losing battle in search of justice gives an extra strength to the character. Spiderman shows the thrill and energy of someone whose life has just changed, becomeing a superhero, getting the girl, not being an unpopular weakling loser anymore. Matt Murdock has grown up blind, gifted with a radar sense and driven to help people by personal tragedy. He's weary of fighting a fight that never seems to be won because people like the Kingpin let murderers walk free and the only way to get ahead is with terror and evil, hes lost his faith and needs to find some way to regain it and remember what hes fighting for. In many ways Daredevil is the everymans superhero, because in a world were terrorists hold the world ransom every day and even now we are facing war, DD's dark Hell's Kitchen mirrors our own troubled world, and reminds us what we are fighting for.",Daredevil
581,OpinionatedBystander,"Enjoyable, but lacking something...",5,17 February 2003,"I must preface this review by stating that I've never read any Daredevil comics before. I can only assume that the movie followed the basic premises of the comic books, although some of the people I've since talked to have claimed that the storyline has been warped so that very little of what actually happened happens in the movie. Instead, I'm just going to try to address the technical aspects, and well, how fun the movie was to watch.I thought the movie started on a very cheesy note, especially with the flashing, shiny DD logo in the beginning. Now seriously, was that necessary? It certainly makes a movie hard to legitimize when such painful weirdness floats up on the screen. Thankfully, however, the movie soon took a more somber tone, which persists throughout the rest of the story.After the first fight scene, the pattern of the movie was set. Daredevil would kick everybody's ass he fought in a dazzling array of acrobatic skills...right. Personally, I thought the fight scenes were sub-par, and frankly, just plain weird. However, it's not as bad as some other movies in recent history, so we can let that slide.The casting in this movie was interesting, to say the least. Ben Affleck seemed OK, although he still doesn't strike me as a very good superhero, in any sense of the word. Colin Farrell as Bullseye was either hit or miss, although for the most part his competent acting skills were wasted on such a poorly written character. (I can only wonder what Bullseye was like in the comic books). Jennifer Garner was sufficiently hot as the token female love interest. MCD was a good kingpin, although his role was much smaller than I thought it'd be.On the whole, the movie was enjoyable to watch, although not up to, say, Spiderman's level of a comic book movie adaptation. It felt like exactly what it was: A high-budget movie with A-list actors performing a B-level script.OB",Daredevil

583,macleod5555,Wasted Potential.,5,15 February 2003,"After a very promising opening half hour, the movie just starts to suck, and not because of Ben Affleck (he's as good as anyone could be) and not because its about a blind superhero (the character of Daredevil is awesome).  It sucked because the dialogue is laughable (Affleck and Garner share the cheesiest romantic lines since Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman), some scenes are taken directly from Batman, and I highly suspect that the director himself is blind because the action sequences are so dimly lit and full of flashing lights that all you can see is a vague red blur.  Also, the movie, with a running time of 96 minutes, is over half and hour shorter than great superhero movies like Superman, Spiderman, and Batman, so the whole thing feels rushed.  The appropriate amount of time is spent on his childhood, but after that its like your watching cliffs notes.  The three non-Affleck leads don't get the screen time they deserve or need to develop there characters: the entirity of Jennifer Garner's action scenes are in the previews, and so little time is spent on Colin Farrel and Michael Clarke Duncan that, despite great appropriately over-the-top performances, they just can't be anywhere near as good as supervillains like Willem Dafoe or Jack Nicholson.  The whole premise is just so cool that I cry at the movie Daredevil could have been.",Daredevil
584,Batman324,This was an awesome movie!!!!,10,16 February 2003,"This was without a doubt the best Marvel-based comic book movie ever made. It was a lot more action-oriented then Spider-man and more visually stunning than X-men.  For the acting, I highly doubt that anyone could have pulled off the role of Daredevil/Matt Murdock better than Ben Affleck.  He actually looked like Matt Murdock.  If somebody like Vin Diesil was cast as Daredevil, it would have thrown off the entire movie, thus throwing it in the gutter.  Jennifer Garner was very good as Elektra.  The sense that she was greek could have been a little bit more enhanced, but other than that, she was perfect.  Colin Ferrill was Bullseye.  Enough said.  I thought that Michael Clarke Duncan was good as Kingpin, but I did have a problem with him fighting Daredevil at the end.  In the comic, Kingpin rarely got involved physically.  But for a guy like Duncan's physique, there was no way he could be in the movie without showing off his massive size.  The cinematics were off the hook, and I believe that the script was very strong.  This was an unbelievable movie that deserves a lot more credit that it has received from some of these buttmonkey critics on the internet.  This movie was dope!",Daredevil
585,WilliamCutting,"This movie was, in a word, disappointing.",3,21 February 2003,"I think Daredevil is a good example of shoddy film making. The direction is choppy and bizarrely inept, the script is completely bland, and all of the actors are completely wasted. It would have been interesting to see what they could have done if they had actual been given real parts to play. The only thing that even halfway works in the movie is the relationship between Affleck and Garner. She is the one character who's halfway well done, she herself added at least a star to my rating, the fact that she's so amazingly beautiful probably helps too but that isn't all of it. The acting is pretty well done all around it just has no where to go and nothing to work with. The villians aren't given anything to do, they have no depth, we know nothing about them, and they have no cool lines. In fact, nobody especially has any cool lines which is tragic because superhero movies should be all about cool if nothing else. The first action scene (in the bar) is so disorienting that it's amazing it got out of the editing room. The entire film is full of continuity errors which I won't get into specifically because I don't want to risk spoiling anything. I was actually looking forward to this one but it was incredibly disappointing. Go watch Batman, Spiderman, and X-Men for a good time. KS",Daredevil

Then again, this is not any other movie, it is a superhero-movies, and I've accepted superheromovies to be a genere of its own a long time ago, and this one really had the superhero feel.

The good points Colin Farrell did a decent job as Bullseye. Michael Clark Duncan good as Kingpin Soundtrack I liked Jon Favreau as wellThe bad points Ben Affleck Jennifer Garner (her acting was particularly horrible)lack of emotion and a decent story line. It seems they might have been better served to have concentrated on maybe just one storyline, pick one either Electra or Kingpin.",Daredevil
589,spar10,Has Ben Affleck made a good movie without Matt Damon in it?,2,3 August 2003,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. There was no character development at all... we see Daredevil's origin, and then jump forward several years in his crime fighting career. The Kingpin is his arch enemy...yet we see only one lame scenerio showing Daredevil break up a crime by one of the Kingpin's henchmen. Ben Urich, a reporter, suspects Matt Murdoch of being Daredevil...why? This is never explained. Elektra, daughter of a crime boss, is a trained martial artists...why? this is never explained.The character of Matt Murdoch/Daredevil is reduced to an immoral vigilante with a preteen disposition. What makes the character interesting in the comics is that he is crimefighter by night, lawyer by day. Daredevil believes in the justice system.***SPOILER WARNINGS*** Yet in one scene, he loses a case, and then goes out and beats the defendent up. ??? Why bother being a lawyer then?He fights Bullseye, an assassin, and throws him to his death. Yet doesn't kill Kingpin, because ""He's not the bad guy.""? A little too late for that.This could've been a great movie. Instead it was a typical Ben Affleck piece of garbage. (Not blaming him for this travesty, but he does not pick great movies).",Daredevil

I also knew in my mind I was watching a movie.  I didn't get to escape into the big screen.What I did walk away with is how much I enjoy watching Jon Favreau and how Jennifer Garner worked hard to do a lot of her own shots,  kudos to her. Collin was a crazed man.  I hated his character.. but hey..  he WAS the villian after all.   And so hate-able.  I thought the stained glass window scene was quite silly.

Yes, some of the lines are corny and the plot is predictable, but in the end it does what it intends... it entertains.If you can watch this movie and enjoy it as a comic book adaptation rather than a well-crafted drama, you'll have a good time.  Ben Affleck gives one of the better superhero performances in recent memory, not that he has much competition.  Jennifer Garner is perfectly cast as Elektra.  Finally, both of the villains are well done in a campy sort of way.As for the recent comparisons, I think it's a least as good as Spiderman, and is much better than the first X-Men movie.  So I recommend this movie for anyone who likes comic book inspired movies, or even enjoys the occasional mindless action flick.",Daredevil
592,freewillgeek,Repelling the bias against Daredevil,8,15 July 2003,"Much of the critique here is harsh and unwarranted, in my opinion. The Daredevil film was the Batman movie that Warner was always too scared to make, in many ways. It's dark, brooding, action packed with REAL fighting scenes as opposed to stiff guys beating up ham fisted supporting villains.
If you compare the film with Spider-Man (which had a massive budget and was a much brighter film in terms of colors and mood), you probably WON'T like it. HOWEVER, if you put it in the context of the Daredevil comic (novel idea, eh?) you SHOULD come away with the sense that it's pretty accurately rendered mood-wise, with some nice comic relief and interesting and somewhat tense encounters with some pretty mean bad guys. It might not make fanboys completely happy in some aspects, such as the slight modifying of the origin, but it's close enough to the book's ideas and visuals that those mildly altered aspects of the film aren't distracting. One cool cameo: Frank Miller. This is basically Frank's take on the character in a multitude of ways, so that was fitting.People not familiar with the comic should at the very least enjoy Colin Farrell's wickedly charismatic scene stealing role as Bullseye.It isn't perfect, but as far as the genre goes, it's pretty darn good. I think Affleck may take an undue beating on the film, as well, as far as reviews go. I found him to have made an excellent Murdock and an effective and credible Daredevil, and for me, it was an exciting and fun venture into the dark world of Hell's Kitchen.",Daredevil
593,bonnynklyd,"""If it looks like The Phantom, and smells like The Phantom... """,1,17 October 2003,"Daredevil is a hero movie. Unfortunately, the hero happens to be James Acheson. I looked his name up on the credits and he is the costume designer. When the makers of the film paid him to make a very camp Daredevil suit he did as they asked. Everyone else involved should be ashamed of this sorry mess of a film. I could go on, and I will.In your average blockbuster you'll see action, follow a storyline, perhaps witness a little love interest. This will build up to a grand finale, a showdown. And would just a small amount of good acting be too much to ask? Apparently so, because on all counts this movie fails.
When a comic-book action movie contains only a handful of minutes of said action, you know there's a problem. That isn't even the bad news regarding action in this film. As if by accident Daredevil battles Bullseye for a second time. At this point the CGI characters (yes, i think Colin and Ben were in a bar drinking when this scene was made) move in. Did I mention that they move in like drunken idiots, unconvincingly lurching up and down, all over the screen. Didn't the CGI guys see The Matrix (original or :Reloaded), or Blade?As for the storyline, don't get me started. Because I won't know where to. Was there a story? I saw this film an hour ago and I can't tell you what happened apart from people fighting, crying, kissing and dying. the scriptwriters should never be allowed out of the unemployment line again.A big deal was made of Jennifer Garner taking on the part of Elektra. I think she read the script and thought she was playing Carmen Electra, because that's how much of an acting range she shows in this film (and I'm a big fan of Carmen.) Garner and Ben had no chemistry at all. A stink bomb has more chemistry, and would have done the job (i.e stunk to high heaven) better than this film for a lot less money. Ben has no excuse, as I'm fairly sure J-Lo made him sit down and watch all her movies. Did he watch Out Of Sight? (Imagine J-Lo being better than you at acting...)And on the subject of acting the usually dependable Colin Farrell manages to play a very unconvincing Irishman, which is no mean feat for an actual Irishman. Yet another illustration of just how poor this film is.You've still managed to make it to the end of the movie instead of a) destroying your TV, or b) plain old falling asleep? I won't spoil the ending but you are rewarded (and I use the word 'rewarded' loosely) by a total lack of a spectacular showdown. Instead Daredevil gets really angry to all the naughty men who've stayed up past their bedtimes. You can almost hear Daredevil say ""Hey, don't make me come up there!"" as he wanders into the night one last time (hopefully, anyway.)This film gets 0 out of 10, with perhaps an extra 1 for costume design.",Daredevil
594,macca-missbookworm,Great film,10,27 March 2018,"I have loved this movie ever since I saw it when I was 7. And every time I watch it, it gets better. Great overall. But since I like the movie , I cant get into the TV show. The movie is so much more in depth with its history, and the classic the hero finds his way, by himself. Great character casting. Great chemistry between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, this is ever present when they got married :) The fight scenes are well written as well. They don't get boring, and they are quite mesmerizing. I especially like how they show us what he sees even though he's blind, its a clever way of representing how he sees the world. Also the humor is great, its grown up humor so little kids wont get it, but its not a little kids movie, and yes I said when I was seven, but I've always been weird in my movie selections. And the best thing overall is the soundtrack. Oh my god. Its awesome, classic music for its time, and perfectly matching its coinciding scenes in the film. So anyone who doesn't like the TV show, will love the movie and vise versa, love the TV show will hate the film.",Daredevil

I love that the original creator made a very unique superhero who is blind and has his other senses heightened (which helps!) Ben Affleck was brilliant as The Daredevil, I think they chose the perfect person for that role.Having seen Armageddon, I recognised the actor who is Bear in that and The Kingpin in this movie. A completely different role for him from Armageddon, but he made a very good villain.I haven't seen Colin Farell in anything else, but I like him already. He was great in this and it reminded me of the Irish villain in Charlie's Angels 2 - it makes a change from an English, German or Russian villain! The special effects were brilliant and so was the fighting. The story was very exciting and not too predictable. This calls out for a sequel IMO.",Daredevil

597,questioningshadows,One of the worst movies out there!,4,22 April 2004,"Ben Affleck is a decent actor.  But he is a horrible Daredevil.  Daredevil has an interesting story to tell.  But this was a horrible movie. 
Kingpin is a HUGE, dark, slow yet powerful, white man who pays others to fight for him.  Michael Clark Duncan is a muscular, happy/decent actor, physical, black man who does 'the deed' himself.  Beyond this, the office and personal taste that the movie Kingpin displayed is nothing like the real Kingpin's older, almost antique personal style. Jennifer Garner is a good actress in an awsome show called Alias.  She is also a decent actress playing the Elektra that was written for her in Daredevil.  However, the Elektra in the movie is nothing like the real Elektra, which is the single coolest, most dangerous comic book heroin (not to mention that shes not WHITE) ever.  I feel that the writers, casting crew, and director totally screwed this name and movie up.  Bad.  Having a black Kingpin was kinda cool, but casting Ben Afflek as Daredevil, and having a white Elektra, sucked!",Daredevil
598,hadialam,"This screams out 'POTENTIAL""!!!",6,20 December 2012,"This is one of those movies where you either rate it really high, or very low. After watching this, I wanted to give it a 10/10. There are so many aspects of the film that are perfect. And perfection is rare in the film industry.For example, the script and screen play were simply amazing as was the storyline. It was so good in fact that in regards storyline and screenplay, I place this in my list of top 5 films for screen play. The cast and acting was so full of talent that it almost made me feel sorry for them, as their efforts were wasted due to the mediocre editing. The acting across the board was great. From Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner to Jon Favreu and Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan, just really good. Costume design was spot on and character development really drew me into the movie. Basicaly, there was something for everyone.The few but major drawbacks were the fight scenes, special effects in some areas and continuity. The fight scenes appeared slow and deliberate and frankly uninteresting. The special effects at times showed the age of the film but in its own defense, it was made almost 10 years ago! However, for me, the biggest drawback was the continuity. For example, when Elektra is stabbed by Bullseye, it shows the blade come up through the lower stomach and come out in the upper back area. However, when she is cast aside, we see the stab wound down near her behind on her lower back. Another instance is when Bullseye takes Daredevils 'Billy Club' and spears a man, Daredevil runs away with the Billy Club in his hand and he was nowhere near the attacked man! For me, the small details make the difference between a good movie and an amazing movie. Unfortunately, as much as I want to review this as an amazing film, it just stands as a film that was good, not amazing.For those of you who want to watch an improved edition of 'Daredevil', I highly recommend the directors cut which is 30 minutes longer than the theatrical edition however, it is a huge improvement. If I was to review the Directors Cut of Daredevil, 9/10 for sure!! Everything is better, the fight scenes, character development and as for continuity, the extended edition explains the missing gaps from the theatrical edition.A good movie that lacks the edge to become amazing, it screams potential, but I still love it!!",Daredevil
599,subterranean-1,why did this get made?,1,9 October 2004,"I am not a fan of Daredevil, but I thought that Frank Miller's Electra saga, which this is loosely based on, was a good piece of comic book storytelling. Daredevil, while on the more unbelievable side of super-hero characters, made sense, and his romance and subsequent fall-out with Electra made for some nice reading. This movie, however, manages to worse than X-Men 1, and even than Batman Forever. It all starts with casting. While Jennifer Garner has rightly been called eye-candy, Ben Affleck, slick (not to say greasy) as ever, is a complete mis-cast for Daredevil. To see him as a tragic character is a stretch for even the most gullible imagination. The story is muddled, and shakily paced, dragging on and on and on - without ever really gaining enough momentum to draw the viewer into the movie. The special effects belong in a video-game, and made me wonder where the budget on this went - especially since the music is some of the cheapest I've heard during recent years. The way strings, strings, and strings again, are used to evoke a romantic feeling during the rooftop scene where Daredevil sees Elektra's face by listening to the sounds of raindrops falling on it is sickening. Oh, and I wasn't the only one to be bored mindless by this. Several friends, none of them normally critical of standard Hollywood fare, who I watched this with, wholeheartedly agree with me. If you've got to watch this for any reason whatsoever (and I really can't imagine one), make sure to keep a bottle of hard liquor handy to ease the boredom and subdue the pain. Or better yet, watch X-Men 2 or Batman 2 instead, even should you already have seem them dozens of times before.",Daredevil

I already know why Kinpin's black instead of white, but did they have to change his hideout? I watched the Spiderman cartoon that was made in the 90s and it showed that the Kingpin's hideout was the Empire State Building. Then I watched Dardevil, and it showed that Kingpin's hideout was in a different building in New York that no one has ever heard of. I think that whoever made this movie should put the Empire State Building as the Kingpin's hideout. Also, How come they put references to other comics besides Kingpin. In the Spiderman comics Ben Urich worked for the Daily bugle. In Daredevil, Urich didn't say who he worked for. They also put Elektra in the movie.

I can't believe that hes blind, it's too fake that part, that no one(not even his momma i guess) could believe that he is Blind, and maybe the most important: he is not an action actor, and it's been proof in pearl Harbor, or in Paccheck, instead, I don't know he is an actor only from teeth outside.And Jennifer Garner...

603,Dragondrawer88,What a great way to destroy a comic book legend,1,25 August 2005,"Let me start by saying if you haven't seen this movie yet don't bother to. This is by far the lamest attempt to create a comic book movie I have ever seen, ( Even the 1994 bootleg version of the Fantastic Four was better!) This movie has shown me and many others how bad Ben Aflack's, ( forgive me if I spelt that wrong) acting can truly be. This movie consists of fast paced action scenes which are almost too fast paced, and are placed way to close together, and a plot that is almost as drawn out and sketchy as Rocky Horror Picture Show, (which is still better then this film). This movie shows how unpractical these events can truly be, I mean take a look at the X-men movies, sure the thought of people gaining powers by advanced DNA structures is far-fetched, but it makes a hell of a lot of sense then just getting them, In the case of the Daredevil movie, apparently when you lose a loved one, You automatically gain superhuman abilities, demonstrated by the films short lived hero Elektra, (By the way I would not recommend that movie either.)After she loses her father, Who is killed by Bullseye, of coarse she wants her revenge, so with one nights training and an Evanesence CD, Daddy's little girl is now a one man army, and a killing machine. Out to get Daredevil who Elektra thinks killed her father, shes leaping tall buildings and dodging stray bullets, ( by the way this is all happening in a time span of about what appears to be three to four days.) "" Is there anything good about this movie?"" you ask, well there is some really nice end credits, and they play a lot of Evanesence music so I guess thats a plus.

'DAREDEVIL' is no exception to this i mean what could beat a blind superhero who could beat the crap out of you in a second. LOL. 'DAREDEVIL' is the story of Matt Murdock(Ben Affleck)the blind lawyer who was blinded by toxic waste when he was a kid, going round performing ""Justice"" on those people that get away with the crimes they've committed. It also introduce the sexy female assassin character Elektra Natchios(Jennifa Garner)who goes onto have her own film follow up to 'DAREDEVIL' called surprise surprise 'ELEKTRA' which is a really cool film but we are speaking about 'DAREDEVIL' at the moment.The original version of 'DAREDEVIL' is OK but the directors cut version spices up the relationship between Matt and Elektra and also introduces a whole new story line into the film which makes Matt's Job as a lawyer have more of an effect on the story.

606,jorel845,What Spiderman wishes it could be,8,14 February 2003,"Red, dark and liquid; Daredevil is pleasantly brought to the screen by director Johnson with an adaptation that knows how to tinge the Marvel superhero with Catholicism and tragedy. Action wise, the stunts by Affleck and Garner are complemented by CGI instead of being showcased, although most of the kudos belong to Colin Farrell for a villain fluid, lethal and funny.
Affleck sheds enough of his celebrity skin to be both Murdock and Daredevil, a quality actors lack when playing one of the iconic superheroes (Keaton's Batman and Tobe Maguire's strained attempts at the wisecracking Spiderman). A sense of intimacy and understanding is created with the Murdock/Daredevil after the quick, if not sometimes sappy origin sequence. John Favreau as Foggy Nelson interjects cynicism and masterful comic timing to make him see more like a kid brother than as the sidekick his character is normally portrayed in the comics. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin is intimidating if not a bit mischeivous; his impish grin makes him seem more like a kid who's gotten away with something despite his 300 lbs plus girth.
Garner is probably the weakest link in the cast. Yes, she's beautiful, yes, she can do her own stunts, but there's an element of stiffness to her when she's jumping from rooftops or twirling her Sais. You can almost catch her counting along with the choreography during most fight scenes. Elektra's dark beauty is lost in her brown locks, but there are flickers of spice in her performance that isn't always ruined by her pouting and breathless dialogue.
An excellent adaptation, comic fans will love all the references that are sure to be missed even if you're not blind.
8.5 stars out of 10.SPOILER!!!!!!!

607,Rikdvader,better than Spiderman? not from a comic book fans view!,5,15 February 2003,"Having read both comics from a young age(I'm 34 now) I cannot think it was better than Spiderman. This movie was turned from the comic in the beginning, and got further away as it went along. At least the Spiderman movie, while warping the time-line a bit, stuck to the story. As Mary Jane being an innocent victim, it's true also to the comic. Spiderman was better made, had MUCH better acting talent and scripting, and the plot was a whole lot better.",Daredevil
608,theboywil,proper comic book feel...,9,24 February 2003,there should be more comic book heros filmed like this... lots of comic book frame coolness... if you know what I mean here.. lots of posturing but kept within the context.. it was exellent...,Daredevil
609,Imerald,Just another boring superhero plot,2,11 February 2003,"Ah, yes...Another super hero wielding fancy gadgets and gizmos that can do your windows and everything else. I'm talking about Daredevil. The newest Marvel Comic brought to life by director, Mark Steven Johnson (Simon Birch). Matt Murdock (Scott Terra/Ben Affleck), son of famed boxer, Jack `The Devil' Murdock, is a normal kid, living in Hell's Kitchen. One day, taking a shortcut from home, Matt finds his father beating up a guy for money. Matt is repulsed by his fathers actions and runs, knocking over bio-hazard material, blinding him. Matt soon finds that the bio-hazard chemicals that took away his sight, improved his hearing, making it almost like radar. After Matt's hospital stay, his father promises that they would go on. Matt learns to cope with his handicap, while Jack begins boxing again. But alas, a super hero can't seek vengeance unless someone important dies in his life. I bet you can't guess who gets killed. The movie then goes into the present where Murdock is a lawyer, working for practically nothing. A man gets acquitted for a crime that he obviously did commit. Daredevil soon hunts down the man and seeks his form of `justice' on the guy. Then, throw in a villain named Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), another obsessive compulsive bad guy named Bullseye (Colin Farrell), and last but not least  a love interest (Jennifer Garner) for our hero.I didn't read the comics, and I didn't do any research on the movie. I knew that Daredevil was blind and I was skeptical on how he got around. He has radar. Not bat radar, but a blue-ish light radar where he can see faces and objects. It hurt my eyes, the lights were too bright and the motion of the digital images too fast for my brain to keep up with. The actions scenes were too digitalized and way too fast paced. I could hardly tell who was who. Daredevil is the same old storyline that every super hero has. 1) Loved one dies 2) Seek Revenge on Killer 3) Find love interest played by hot chick 4) Faces more sadness and then declares to keep the city safe. Give me a break...Superman, Batman, X-Men, Spiderman and coming to a theater near you, The Hulk. How many times are directors going to use the same plot over and over again? I'm just happy that I recorded the Westminster Dog Show, at least its one thing I'll get to enjoy.",Daredevil
610,hulkhater,Rather bad,3,10 July 2006,"I had high expectations for this film, some critics raved about it saying it was the best film of the year and so on but in my opinion, it was one of the worst films of the year.OK, some parts were good. I found Matt Murdock's the flashbacks to his childhood mildly entertaining and some of the action scenes were good, but in my opinion it was just too over the top.I was very disappointed with both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner in the movie. The only real performances were from Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell but they weren't enough to save this piece of junk.Don't watch it!",Daredevil
611,VinR53,Better than Batman from the ground up.,10,20 February 2003,"I hold the dubious distinction of seeing the movie Batman more than any other human being on Earth or its satellites (natural or man made).   So I feel confident that I can combat any claim that Batman is a better movie than Daredevil.  The movie Batman, more than anything else, is a showcase for Jack Nicholson to reprise his role as a raving lunatic, only this time in make up.  Daredevil is a much more personal story.  Matt Murdock has to cope with blindness, being an orphan, the responsibility of power, his catholic conscience, and a psychotic Irish assassin who doesn't miss. Batman, in all honesty, is simply the straight man to the Joker.",Daredevil
612,ReaperFett,Best Superhero movie so far,10,13 February 2003,"First, the darkness of this film is VERY surprising. Considering the rating, I was expected a quite watered down film. But instead, you get a film that borders very much on what you'd class as an R rated film.Now, to the film's story. And a strong story it has. It is clear from the start that this is about DAREDEVIL. Whereas Batman and Spiderman being done in such a way that called the movies The Joker or Green Goblin would still work, this is all DD. All the other players are vital into this, but the main story is clearly Daredevil and his internal conflicts. It was good to see a romance be integral for this, instead of the standard ""Let's bolt one on for the hell of it!"". It was clear to me that Mark Steven Johnson cares for Daredevi.It is also surprisingly faithful to the original works. Sure, there are changes, but most of these are to make it a viable film. Sure, in the comics Matt met Elektra at College, but it doesnt work to do it in a movie under two horus long. This change, like all the others, kept the film going.
The dialogue was perfect. Never did it feel particularly corny, but still felt like it came from a comic. I can see myself quoting this film in the future so often I annoy peopleNow, the acting.Ben Affleck for me IS Matt Murdock. He takes the part in his stride, and played what was for me a very believable Daredevil. Unlike most of his roles, he didnt go into a smug character. He was true to the comics, IMO.
Jennifer Garner was better than even I could have expected.
Colin Farrell was the one whose performance I enjoyed the most. You can see he was having fun in this role, and we got a psychotic marksman in return. This is probably my favourite comic book badguy we have ever seen on the screen.Michael Clarke Duncan shuts up those whining about his skin colour. Forget the fact he isn't white, he IS Kingpin. His stature, his manner - Pure Kingpin for me.Also worth a note are Jon Faverau and Joe Pantoliano. Faverau gives us the perfect Foggy Nelson, with a real raport going with Affleck. His humour also improves the film. And Joe Pants is, as always, great.
The fights were outstanding. When Daredevil enters the bar with his two sticks/one stick/one long stick/nuncheck/Grapnel weapon, we see a great fight, which borders on the realistic. And the later fighters are the sort of thing I have been waiting to see since I heard of this movie.
One little note about Special Effects. Daredevil were FAR better than Spidermans swinging. While Spiderman appeared to lose his spine and go bendy, Daredevil has a sluggish, more realistic movement. And Matt's radar sense? Perfect.And a MAJOR high was the sound. If this does not at least get nominated for an Oscar next year, the Oscars deserved to be scrapped. This was something that would either work well or not. And it worked well.
To sum up, this is the best Superhero film I have seen, the best film I've seen in a long time, and maybe one of my favourties ever. And how does it compare to Spiderman? Well, to modify a quote:
""You're good, I'll give you that. But me? I'm magic""",Daredevil
613,BAdgerofire,"Awesome movie, only one thing I wished were different",9,19 February 2003,"I thought the movie was awesome, awesome fight scenes, and it followed the actual comic book origin very closely.  However,  other than a couple of minor moments that were slightly cheesy looking, for example, the time he back flipped another kid when he was 12,  but I wish they would have spent more time on letting us get to know Elektra, her background and character development.  Jennifer Garner's portrayal was amazing and of course anyone would have liked to see more of her.  These are the only reasons I gave it a 9 instead of a 10!!",Daredevil
614,deabaitua,"a great superhero action movie, no more, no less",6,10 February 2003,"In the Marvel Universe of superheroes, Daredevil is the easiest to beat in a fight. Compared to Spider-Man, The Hulk and The X-Men, he is the vulnerable one, the blind one.You sense the crucial image here for the filmmakers is Daredevil (Affleck) in the shower after a bar-room brawl, spitting out broken, bloodied teeth.Writer-director Mark Steven Johnson wants to do integrity so much it hurts, and his hero's vulnerability is a big step toward this ideal.We first meet Daredevil seemingly mortally wounded beside a church altar, his origin story (essential for all superheroes) flashing before his eyes. He is Matt Murdock, raised by his father, boxer Jack 'The Devil' Murdock, in a rough district of New York. A grade 'A' student, young Matt is gutted to stumble onto his father acting as an enforcer for local criminals. He flees this scene and straight into a bio-chemical leak  that robs him of his sight but magnifies his other senses, with his hearing so augmented that it provides him with a kind of sonar. (SPOILER OF FIRST AND SECOND ACT TO FOLLOW)Just like Batman and Spider-Man, Murdock's transformation into a masked man is only completed by his father's death. After refusing to throw a fight, Jack Murdock is beaten to death by a hood - revealed to be the young Wilson Fisk, now New York's criminal overlord, the Kingpin (Duncan). This alleyway death, the local hoods and the fixed fight are indicative of the character's age. Invented in 1964 by Stan Lee and Bill Everett in an attempt to follow-up the success of Spider-Man, Daredevil was long thought of as a second-rate hero. It took an 80s reinvention by writer Frank Miller, whose sensibilities lay squarely in morally ambiguous, violent noir, to give the character some integrity, and it is Miller's interpretation that is referenced heavily here, often word-by-word.Unfortunately, for all its ostensible seriousness and its faithfulness to its source material, Daredevil is more of a nu-noir. Its stab at gritty integrity is as convincing and authentic as the rock postures of its nu-metal soundtrack.The first two thirds are heavy with cliché. Matt Murdock falls in love with Elektra (Garner) after her perfumed, slo-mo entrance into a cafe. She gets to flick her hair in slo-mo later during an appalling love scene (they're kissing one another's scars - how, like, meaningful). Elektra also gets to throw her head back in the rain, and she gets her shoulder smelt erotically by Affleck on a number of occasions. Audiences will also require patience for the speed through Murdock's boyhood and the constant interruptions of the execrable soundtrack, which replaces any trace of real emotion with MTV pout.(A SECOND ACT SPOILER HERE)
As an action movie, Daredevil only takes off after the murder of Elektra's father by assassin Bullseye (Farrell), an Irish killer with an Oirish rap theme tune (House Of Pain, predictably). He steals every scene he is in with his murderous comic ability to turn anything - even a paper clip - into a deadly weapon. Employed by crime overlord the Kingpin, Bullseye is the most entertaining supervillain since Nicholson's Joker, and miles ahead of Willem Defoe's dull Green Goblin. Duncan is also immense, convincing in both sides of the Kingpin's character, as business magnate and gargantuan Bronx brawler. Rounding out this excellent support cast is Jon Favreau as Murdock's tubby lawyer partner Foggy, with his ""As your attorney, I recommend..."" routine nicked straight from Hunter S Thompson.Ultimately, Daredevil just doesn't have the talent behind the camera to carry off its noir seriousness. But for all its clichés, it has a cracking third act, helped by doses of 15-rated violence.",Daredevil

From the opening credits to the end of the movie-- it was a lot of fun!! The audience response was great-- got some good laughs from the movie-- had a mixture of drama, action, suspense and comedy...Kevin Smith (of Clerks and Chasing Amy fame) does a cameo--- incidentally, did anyone see An Evening With Kevin Smith DVD where he talked about how he recommended Ben Affleck for the part of Daredevil...Ben Affleck did a great job as Daredevil; Colin Farrell's role as Bullseye was outstanding, too-- provided some humor to the movie, and Jennifer Garner was such a knockout!! My favorite scene was when Ben was trying to find out Jennifer's name and they got into a duel-- ala-Crouching Tiger...definitely a must-see movie!! Great visuals, too!!! I give it *** out of ****!! Definitely at par, if not better, than Spider-Man!! They also showed an extended X2 trailer-- can't wait for that one, too!!

616,bansheevt,Way off the bullseye...,4,31 August 2004,"This film clearly had potential - respected actors, a fine comic book background, and enough of a budget to produce decent special effects and props. Of course, this all may help, but it's clearly, as this movie only goes to show, insufficient. I can appreciate a comic-book sense of unreality, where heroes do impossible things, but when a villain with an uncanny knack for skewering olives with ballpoint pens is more comical than frightening, and the action is so unreal that throats are slashed with playing cards and flies impaled with hurled syringes by a man in a full body cast, I'm no longer entertained. Watching a bad movie can be fun in the right company, and I suspect that this is no exception. Go ahead a watch it if you dare, but I wouldn't expect very much.In the end, Daredevil resembles nothing so much as a bad joke, leaving the audience waiting for a punchline that's never going to come.",Daredevil
617,Narrenkoenig,You have to see the Director's Cut,8,5 November 2006,"I've seen Daredevil and was not very excited. I am a great fan of the comic books and know how dark and deep they are. The movie was a middle-class superhero action movie, not nearly adequat for this comic masterworks. After I saw the ""Directors Cut"", I was deeply shocked. I've never seen a Directors Cut that was so different from the cinematic version, and never seen a movie that was Completely changed after the directors cut, too. The producers took out the hole plot and left a skin deep ""chasing the killer of my girlfriend movie"".Especially if you don't like Daredevil, you have to see the new version and you'll see how dark, poetic and beautiful the movie really is. I am really surprised that the cinematic version wasn't like the Director's Cut, and surprised that the guys who was responsible for cutting out all the stuff that made the movie a really deep and good one, doesn't recognice how bad the cinematic version looks like.",Daredevil
618,sakshianjani,This movie hurt me physically,1,1 October 2021,"I absolutely love the character daredevil and I have always dreamt about seeing a daredevil feature film. Instead I got this steamy pile of cow dung which was solely made for money. Following Sam Raimi's Spiderman movies, there was in increase of low budget marvel cliche films which had the same plot over and over again. Guy is disliked by the masses, gets powers, gets suits and even gets the girl and destroys the big evil bad guy. This follows exactly that. The fight sequences are choreographed by a 2nd grader because they look like a 7 yr old flinging their toys. The characters are too damn annoying and they are supposed to be meant to be liked! Especially Jon Favreau's Foggy Nelson. This guy is supposed to be the comic relief? This is the first time i'm going to say this but netflix did it better. Matt Murdock had zero personality and Wilson Fisk was the most cliche super hero villain. Seriously Ben Affleck? Seriously Jon Favreau? Keep away from this movie, your braincells will deplete and receive mind numbing brain damage. Suggestion; Watch a toilet flushing instead!",Daredevil
619,Stoneysilence,Ho Hum.,6,16 February 2003,"This movie was ok.  I didn't like the computer graphics.  The fighting at times reminded me of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon were they just flew but the chars in these scenes were computer graphics and CTHD was wires. Would have preferred wires over the horrible computer graphics.  Thought the same thing about Spiderman.  Looks like Hulk will be the same way.  X-Men 2 in the previews looks promising though.We'll see, eedmond",Daredevil
620,evildeath,The Review Without Fear,6,15 February 2003,"I'm not going to tell you not to waste your time, because the movie isn't awful, but Daredevil doesn't have anything to offer that Batman didn't give us.  Worse, Daredevil doesn't even look as good as Burton's movie, which is now almost fifteen years old.  There were some very nice touches - the shots from Matt Murdock's perspective showing how he sees the world are an especial standout - and Colin Farrell was superb, but I was left thinking that it should have been so much better.WARNING: This film contains stroboscopic lighting.",Daredevil
621,Tyco88,Cream of the Crop,7,18 February 2003,"I'm a big fan of super-heroes and the comic books they inhabit.  I admit it, I'm film geek when it comes to this stuff.  I think I've seen almost every super-hero film released over the course of my entire life (almost three decades now).  This one is it.  It actually has the soul of the comic book it is based on.  I cannot say this about the recent Marvel offerings of ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man"".  ""Daredevil"" is the best work of Ben Affleck's career.  Let's face it, the entire thing hinged on his performance.  This fact initially scared me.  I was fairly confident in all the other casting choices.  I had to see the film, though, to be convinced Affleck could play Matt Murdock/Daredevil.  I pleasantly surprised.  The movie could have been longer with more screen time for the supporting cast and for me the ending was a little too ""rosey"" for a Daredevil story, but overall it didn't sport the flaws of other comic book movies in the near past.  I walked away impressed with the product.  Money well spent and pleased to have gone opening night.",Daredevil
622,qwertyds,Gave is a 6 could of easily been an 8.,6,6 May 2003,"This film was 90 minutes, why? It wasn't a comedy or animated feature the typical films that only run the 90minute format. So why in a film so weak in plot did they decide not to fill this movie out too a good 2hours and give it the plot it needed?!? The Action was good, the acting was fine, but the developement needed more. As well could they of please not borrowed from other Comic Hero Movies, including especially Daredevil's identity being discovered not once in the movie but three times! At least Batman, Superman and Spiderman all keep it down to the minimum. Lastly I feel that the fight with Fisk really didn't fit into the story, something that would of been better for a sequel in my humble opinion, but this was the least of the problems.So Basically an Okay film, but if they had filled in the story with more background and connected each scene together more smoothly, this film could of been allot better received by its viewers.",Daredevil
623,creimire,I had low expectations..,6,15 February 2003,"Overall a good movie, I never once yawned which is good.  Action packed with well done visuals.  Daredevil is about as true to the comic book as Spiderman was, if you are a huge fan of the comic you may be disappointed. Give it a chance though and you might enjoy yourself.Ben Affleck's acting seemed a bit flat(good but flat), he certainly looked the part however his ""I am blind and to act blind I shall stare past the camera and look up while I walk, this is acting and proves I am blind"" approach seemed kind of annoying (although he may have been directed to do that).Jennifer Garner did a good job with what she had to work with, the character of Elektra is more like window dressing than a character in the movie.  I think they could have added 15 minutes just to explain and expand on her character more.  In the end I didn't have any feelings towards the character.Michel Clarke Duncan, was a good Kingpin, dramatically different (yet not unbelievable ) from the comic, but still good.  Just my 1000 cents.",Daredevil

Thus, the rest of the movie is a complicated twist of Daredevil fighting the bad guys and fighting for the two people he loves in his life. Does he succeed? make sure to stay threw the credits for a special scene. The humor in this movie was kind of cheesy but what I expected for this type of movie. There are some cool scenes where the audience sees what daredevil ""sees"" - he sees from noises, sensations, etc. Overall, it was an action packed adventure that I enjoyed. It seemed a little short and I would've have liked to see more of Daredevil fighting bad guys instead of Bullseye killing people. But I gave it an 8/10.",Daredevil

The theatrical cut is at least worth 6/10). To all who haven't watched the Director's cut, go watch it and then re-vote. I gave this movie a 6/10 when I saw the theatrical version, but after reading other peoples comments I bought the Director's cut, and god damn i'm glad i did.About 5 minutes after i watched the director's cut i logged back in to vote again. I was going to give it a 7 or 8 out of 10, but i saw the low score and the director's cut is much better than a 5.5/10 so i gave it a 9/10.As the theatrical cut is like a stereotype Hollywood bummer, with a shallow story and some fighting and half the movie is based on romance, the director's cut is longer and a bit more brutal film that gives much more sense with a much deeper story, which doesn't focus that much on Electra but gives you more from all the other characters.So my word is: Go watch the Director's Cut and vote again.",Daredevil

627,daffodil-1,"Finally, a truly decent superhero movie.",9,17 July 2003,"Having seen the awful mess that was made of all four modern ""Batman"" films, and the pre-pubescent travesty that was ""Spiderman"", I had obviously lost a lot of faith in the superhero genre...(""Mystery Men"" and ""X-men2"" at least provided some relief). When I saw that ""Daredevil"" was being filmed I cringed in horror at the potential damage Hollywood could possibly visit upon another comic-book hero. Consequently I didn't go to the cinema to see ""Daredevil"", I felt there was only more disappointment round this particular corner. Luckily I was totally wrong.Having just watched DD on DVD, I am very pleasantly surprised indeed. It's a wonderfully dark and adult vision of an extremely ambiguous subject matter. Sure it has a few of the old superhero cliches but the way this subject matter has been treated so seriously seems to have paid off.This film does not pander to the adolescent minds and attitudes of so many cinema-goers, young and old(see Spiderman for one that does). I didn't feel at all patronised once. A realistic vicious world which contains no moral absolutes, this is a ""grown-up"" film by any standards. If you want mindless comic book action then look elsewhere, DD is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly stagnant genre.If, like me, you've been saddened by the moronic, mass-market pandering, facile, over-hyped, superhero blockbusters of times past, then look no further. Fingers crossed for ""The Hulk"".",Daredevil

I saw it on opening night, so I couldn't hear anyone's insight on it yet and therefore it wasn't spoiled. I knew I would love this film (and yes, it is a great film as well as movie) from the first shot of blood running down stained glass. This will be assumed to be an action flick, cheesy and with the typical comic book characters. THIS IS NOT TRUE. While it holds a great deal of action, this is most definitely an art film. It's beautiful and creative, with things I couldn't have even imagined on film. The acting is surprisingly good... Ben Affleck plays a better super hero than I was expecting and Colin Ferrell plays a great villain. When watching this, you can't help but smile at what he uses to kill. Michael Clark Duncan is perfectly suited as Kingpin, and Jennifer Garner shines brilliantly. Every moment of this film keeps you captivated and wanting more - the near two hours seems to fly by. It's almost... refreshing.. to see a superhero who isn't afraid to kill. Not to mention that he doesn't just kill the usual criminals - he cracks down on those with opposable ethics while being a lawyer in the daytime.

629,StingMcQueef,What a disaster. Not even the Director's Cut saves it.,3,17 March 2008,"I was left very disappointed by this movie on its theatrical form. I thought the acting was mediocre, as well as the direction. There were only a few visual treats that helped me staying in the theater and not asking a refund. And eventually I heard about the Director's Cut and hoped it would show redeeming values and meaningful scenes that were obviously ripped from the original cut.Good god, was I wrong... The deleted scenes are absolutely useless and concern mainly the ""Courtroom"" angle, by showing poor Ben Affleck thriving by finding an even worse actor than him (Coolio) to chew the scenery with (I'm a bit heavy handed here since Affleck proved he could act sometimes) in a pathetic subplot treated almost like a comedy while the movie needed some drama to faithfully address the hero's dilemma toward Justice (a staple in the comics). Shame.What pisses me the most is the posture of some fans who can't acknowledge the fact that the movie is mediocre at best, and try to cover their disappointment by singing the praises of the Director's Cut while it's essentially the same terrible film, only MUCH longer. I can understand that some people genuinely loved it, and I respect that; but some are just boldface liars unable to admit that the new cut is a joke, and that the joke's on those who double-dipped the DVD. So, here's a useful advice if you're reading these lines and were about to give the new cut a chance: DO NOT believe the hype, this is just 130 minutes of boredom, cheesy humor and bad acting. Just like it was in theaters.",Daredevil

Of course it isn't going to be a Box Office Giant like Spiderman was and its not going to be an Oscar contender ... actually if Lord Of The Rings can be nominated for Best Picture, DD has a shot too, but for a comic book adaptation it should be hard to beat.All the actors do a superb job, especially Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell. Mark Steven Johnson does a wonderful job at bringing something new visually to the table with Daredevil and all in all its a very entertaining movie, well worth the price of admission. And even if you take away all the stunning effects, solid plot, good action, and great characters, lets face it, any movie where Kevin Smith is talking is a winner. (No hate mail please)While the Matt Murdock character isn't nearly as colorful as Peter Parker was in Spiderman, Daredevil himself is much more the hero than Spidey proved to be. The film has a very dark tone, much like the original Batman but also has the action/wit that Spiderman tried to achieve, so please give Daredevil a chance and don't just listen to the Movie Critics ""aka: People who can't do, yet get paid to complain about people who can"" when deciding what to go watch.",Daredevil

Great sound, great FX (and great they don't rely on digital effects as the so dependant Spiderman), a spot on cast (yes, Affleck is great), and great length: the movie just leaves you wanting more.It's is a shame that so many people will miss such a great movie just because they don't like the cast or the character, or even more stupid because they compare it to Spiderman....

634,matty_phila,Even my boy Colin Farrell couldn't save this one!,2,8 June 2003,"Before you read this review, be warned:  I can't stand Ben Affleck, and I've been irrationally prejudiced against Jennifer Garner ever since ""Alias"" managed to get all the attention that ""La Femme Nikita"" should have gotten, but didn't.  But all that aside, I walked into this movie wanting to give it at least a 3 out of 5, but walked out realizing that 1 out of 5 was the best I could do.You know you're in trouble when the best part of a superhero movie is the part explaining the origin, before the real plot even begins.  That, and a kickin' soundtrack.Ben Affleck, whatever.  You are optional.  Frankly, I wish somebody else had gotten this part.  Kudos to Jennifer Garner, who managed to walk out of this with a kick-ass role, especially in the scene with the sandbags/bags of flour (whatever, who cares!).  And poor Colin Farrell.  Please, will somebody give him a good role.  Bullseye is not it.  Michael Clarke Duncan does fine in an underwritten part as the Kingpin.  This man could play a very scary, multilevel villain, so what went wrong?  I'll tell you the problem:  Plot, what plot?  I don't remember enough to comment on it. That tells you something.Bottom line, this movie could have been so much better that it is a big disappointment.  1 out of 5.

635,skippythegator,"good enough to kill time with, but not much more",6,24 February 2003,"The action was okay but the storyline was a bit shallow.  Some emotional moments saved the film from being a relatively mindless slug-fest.  Some good special effects were used rather well to put the viewer in Daredevil's shoes.All in all, not a bad way to kill a couple of hours, but not what I'd call a good movie.
***SPOILER ALERT***The playground fight was amazingly senseless.  Come on, it's the kind of thing that happens only in adolescent boys' macho fantasies ;)  and in this scene, Ben Affleck's fighting was below par.  Jennifer Garner's was somewhat better, but not quite good enough to make us believe in her as Elektra the assassin.  And to think Jeff Imada was the fight choreographer!Ditto with the first fight scene in the bar.  I realize DD would definitely try to put out the lights but it still made for a murky, barely visible fight.***END SPOILER***",Daredevil

As USUAL im a BatMan fan(& i still think hes the most Normal of ALL Hero's).Cutting the B.s short,DD is a good movie with an AWSOME OST, ALL the actors deliver,The Fights are real cool....so Why is it so low rated. Well DD is a Comic little known,like X-MEN it did not introduce the charecters and throughout the movie the people might be saying WATS GOING ON? For starters the Hero,Ben-Afleck,is Blind,YET he kiks every baddy's rear.How? Well Blind people can see in Infra @ night.Excuse me but What? We are shown that afleck becomes DD as a promise to help the weak to his Murdered Dad. But Why and HOW?? did he become DD? How did he get the stick?How did he get the suit?Why does he ONLY trust the priest? and HOW did he become a Lawyer? Not EVERYONE has been reading the comic since dayone you know.Other than this HUGE glitch the movie is quite good.Ben Afleck, known to doom many of the movies,does justice to his role(overall) even though he is ridiculos @ some points.Elekta was outright Gorgeous,Jennifer Garner had amazing screen presence,through out the movie i only looked @ her when she was onscreen. Bullseye was Ok, because no Prominance was given to who he was? how was he so good with throws? etc etc.King pin was Ok as well, Like other charecters we were not shown who he was and how he became the Boss and the Baddest of all criminals.This movie would have been a Hit rather than the present average if it had been Daredevil 2.

637,dinosaur_guy,A worthwhile endeavor,6,13 February 2003,"I must admit, I was a bit nervous going in to 'Daredevil.' A relatively unknown and unsuccessful director trying to adapt a virtually unknown comic book, starring an actor with a checkered resume, which does not include many action-hero roles. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the results. The cinematography was commendable, lending itself well to the dark, often chaotic world Matt Murdock inhabits. The movie made a point of not necessarily showcasing every single punch in a fight, but rather presented more ""realistic"" fight scenes (as realistic as one can expect in a superhero flick anyway). But the best component, in my estimation, is its presentation of Daredevil himself. This is a profoundly human superhero, as many people have mentioned. He takes his fair share of licks in any combat situation, even when he ultimately kicks a$$. Murdock is a scarred, battered man, both physically and emotionally. He does not hesitate to let a criminal die, yet contemplates whether he (Daredevil) is always in the right. The writing is not the deepest, or groundbreaking, but certainly as good as any in recent superhero movies. My only real gripe is that the villains do not receive a lot of screen time, which seems to be a prevalent trend of late. All in all, I give this movie a 7/10 and would rank it higher than X-Men. It is consistently entertaining, which is the most I usually expect from action flicks, and on top of that suffers from no major blunders. Is is Shakespeare? Hell no. But who said it should be?",Daredevil

There really wasn't much of a story to be told her at least the writers didn't give it much of a chance.

641,spikebebop,Guardian Devil or Guardian Dramaqueen,3,21 February 2003,"Daredevil, pits Ben Affleck as the blind yet intrepid acrobatic crime fighter/ lawyer from Hell's Kitchen, Matt Murdock.  Cast alongside Affleck is the voluptuous Jennifer Garner, who plays a billionaire's daughter/martial arts master, Elektra Natchios.  Garner embodies the blind lawyer's (Matt Murdock's) love interest by day and the superhero Daredevil's rival by night.  The character development of Matt Murdock (Affleck/ Scott Terra) is compelling and extremely well played by both actors (old and young Murdock respectively).  I also loved Michael Clarke Duncan (plus fifty extra pounds) as crime lord William Fisk a.k.a. the Kingpin, despite the fact that in the comic book Kingpin was white.  And while I've heard complaints about Jennifer Garner's character (Elektra) being fantastically exaggerated beyond reality, let me point out that the screenwriters of the movie were working with comic book characters; I don't know what these critics were expecting when they went to see a Marvel comics film, but apparently comic book characters aren't human enough for them.  My advice to them is not to watch this genre of film if they hate such inherent qualities as over-the-top characters.The obligatory rooftop scenes and subsequent incredible aerial stunts (with some Computer Graphic help) as well as plenty of fantastic martial art scenes carry us through a majority of the film.  But this bombastic level of eye candy is to be expected of the genre, and does not interfere much with the artistic portrayal of Matt Murdock's tragic life story (most of the scenes take place in a flashback).At times the line deliveries are far too dramatic, (especially when Affleck dons the new-age leather superhero outfit) but what more can be expected from an action movie with a comic book premise.  Diehard Marvel comic fans would've felt cheated if director Mark Steven Johnson had downplayed the comic book-esque dialogue.  And the justice cliches are downright unavoidable with a superhero flick.Oh yeah, and the soundtrack really was awful (I repressed the memory as I liked the rest of the film).All in all, I'd recommend that you see this film, but not for its first-rate ticket price, rent it when it comes out on DVD in 6 months.  Because unless you're a big fan of the comic books, or enjoy overdone Hollywood martial art sequences, it's not worth $7.50 and an hour and a half of your time to go see.",Daredevil

I'll let the little things go such as Elektra training with the sandbags (who gets the honor of cleaning up that mess) or Matt Murdoch having a rooftop lair despite only being paid in champagne and sporting goods. As for the cast, Colin Farrell as Bullseye was right on target. Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin was lord of the crime ring. Ben Affleck as Dare Devil himself, well lets just say he didn't mess it up. As far as Jennifer Garner goes, I think a character such as Elektra should have fighting skills on par with Michelle Yeoh rather than Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Sure Ben Affleck may not be Chow Yun Fat but he can always hide behind the costume. The mode and tone were great but the chemistry between Affleck and Garner seemed forced. Dare Devil is not in the same league as Spiderman but is head and shoulders above the X-Men.",Daredevil

647,charlesbastos,almost good,6,27 March 2003,"The Daredevil movie in general had disappointed me, because after the good comic adaptations of X-Man and Spiderman, I was expecting something more. The story simply takes off a very important part of the origin of DareDevil, they don't tell how he learned to fight so well and the most important thing, why he can control his super human senses, all of this, is explained on the marvel comics of DareDevil, and on the movie, suddenly Matt Murdock begins to fight (when child) like a master... About the character of Elektra, the actress (Jennifer Garner) doesn't fit so well with the character, because on the comic she is taller and stronger, and of course fight better. I miss too, more action scenes with Elektra, on this movie she fight a few times only. About Elektra, she on the comic has swords (2 on the back) in addition of the 2 knives that she had on the movie. And one of the worst thing of this movie: the cloth of DareDevil,  who elected this cloth to him? Never on the comics of Daredevil he dressed like that, his clothes always was of a normal tissue, like Spiderman for example. Ben Affleck do very well the character of DareDevil, and Matt Murdock, so Collin Farrel that is amazing being BullsEye, and Michael Claine did very well too the king. Another good thing on this movie is how they describe the super human powers of Daredevil, his super senses, they show this in a fantastic way, because they achieve that the audience feels like they are inside the body of DareDevil and you can understand very well how his super powers works. If they do a sequel (I hope so), I expect that these things (at least - somethings) could be fixed to the next movie.",Daredevil

They were clearly used to sell records to the Hip Gen-Y nu-metal youngsters.In the end, ""Daredevil"" is the epitome of the trash that Hollywood has been producing for the past years.Intelligent audiences are (smartly so) watching more foreign movies (most notably from Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil and France), which are the only ones who actually present new and fresh ideas.Although I still have hope in ""The Hulk"" (as it is directed by the amazing Ang Lee) and in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (directed by the tongue-in-cheek Sam Raimi).",Daredevil

651,merijnhoogenstrijd,Finally a real superhero,5,9 January 2004,"***Warning, Reading my review back I might have a bit to much spoilers in it. If you really want to enjoy the movie better see it first and then check out my opinion :)***
As non-comic book reader and childhood fan of tv comic series I avoided DareDevil for a long time. The same way I did with X-men, Spiderman and Batman movies. Not that I hate comics, I'm  just not a fan or insider enough to understand all there is to know about these movies. Secondly the comics where part of a childhood experience and I have always had the opinion that it should stay that way. That certainly didn't change after seeing X-men (still have to watch part2 :P) and Spiderman. Although it's always cool to see those heroes in a real movie, it was bound to disappoint me. For me X-men and Spiderman couldn't be told in 2 hours. For me that was part of a serie which lasted throughout 6 years of my childhood. Spiderman and X-men turned out disappointing indeed and couldn't tell the right message in the movie.Anyways, time to say something about DD itself. Walking into the videorental store having seen really 90% of all the flicks I just had to take DD home with me. I never read the comic and only saw DD in a guestappearance at the spiderman tv serie so I had non expectations what so ever :D The movie started great showing the story of DD as a child and how he got his special powers (and lost his eyesight). The next few scene's where very special to me since it was almost as if DD was portrayed as a Kung-Fu Monk. For those who don't know about Buddhism Kung-fu; one of the main teachings is that the universe is one and that you can control your surroundings the same way you control your body. You don't need eyesight you need insight.Unfortunately as with most comics, DD has received it's special powers due to bad chemicals. He also doesn't use the Kung-Fu way of seeing but he has some sort of sound made radar. Although not the way I would have liked to see it, the results are almost the same in the first part of the movie. There's one scene in which DD as a kid runs into a 'fight' with neighbourhood kids. The way he beated them up was a as memorable fighting scene as those of Neo in the Matrix movies (very much kung-fu based as well).Anyway let's not get so specific and continue the review. Remember me bitching about the Sound made Radar which DD has, it turns out it makes the movie work very well after all. You know the thing I hated most about people like Spiderman and Batman, they just seem total losers sometimes. Spiderman just seems total useless against some enemy's which gave me the feeling like he was only a half-superhero. DD isn't like that at all. He comes out unafraid (love that part, fear is for the weak), strong, experienced BUT with a handicap (his eyesight). The writers/directors used this very well and made DD a 100% superhero with just 2 weaknesses. His eyesight handicap and his rational questions (Can someone be judge and jury by himself? and does violence only produce more violence?). The only reason DD will ever lose a fight is because of those weaknesses. Not because someone is more stronger than him. And yet, those 2 weaknesses turn out to be great advantages too. That's the way I like to see a superhero movie.Now having said all the good things let's explain why this movie does not deserve more than 3,5 stars out of 5. The script is just to basic sometimes. I think I can take about 80% of everything which is said in this movie and find it back in another movie. Literally. There's just no depth in the dialogue's sometimes.Secondly Ben Affleck is not bad but certainly not good enough. It's ashame Kevin Smith (talking about a comicbook fan !!) didn't direct this movie. The things I saw him doing with Ben just raises the movie to a higher level.And lastly the radar like images where used far to often and began to annoy me after a while. At some keypoints it was used very good but I think they could have easily cut out half of the material.Now I've not said nearly as much as I can (and want) to say about this movie but that leaves more for you to find out. DD is a great concept and has great moments. Yet on the whole it misses out on a few spots and I have the feeling that the concept was not nearly used to it's full potential. However I enjoyed watching it and that's something for me nowadays. I give it a 7 out of 10

652,Oscarthecritic,Blind Justice,8,24 July 2003,"Action, Humour & romance.  Three key ingrediants for a successful storyline. Throw a few experienced, well known & loved actors into the mix and you can't go wrong. I was surprised that Ben Affleck agreed to do the film, but I think his realism of Matt Murdock was probably the best I've seen in a Marvel movie to date. I'm sure Blade fans will object, but to me Wesley Snipes found it easy to play that sort of character, where as Ben Affleck had to adapt from the usual out-going, popular, charismatic characters he usually portrays. The increasingly popular Colin Farrell was superb and some say he stole the show, but like Michael Clarke Duncan the two didn't really feature much in the movie.  I thought the casting crew made an excellent choice in selecting Clarke Duncan for the role of the Wilson Fisk. For me there is no other actor out there with the stature to live up to New York's kingpin. The star of the show for me was the stunningly beautiful Jennifer Garner.  Playing kickass heroine Elektra her connection with Ben on the screen can only be described as perfect. I'll look out for the spinoff movie Elektra next year. So being a blind lawyer through the day with his partner (played by the comical John Favreau) Matt Murdock slips into his red latex at night to single out those who he can't convince the jury are guilty in court.  Not really with any special powers except a radar triggered from sound waves, some martial arts and acrobatic ability as well as his other senses heightened through lack of sight, Murdock's main priority is to find the man who killed his father. Known only to Murdock as New York's Kingpin of crime. The special thing about DareDevil is he isn't really a superhero; he's a vigilante fueled by vengence. He won't bag the villain up until the cops get there; he'll actually kill the villain. And right from the start we can see that ordinary men can give the guy a run for his money as in the shower scene he's covered in scars. Mark Steven Johnson has received some criticism for the way the movie was dictated, but for me he brought the right darkening image to the DareDevil genre.  Not only that, but he achieved what no other director has achieved to date, which is not change anything about the character nor his origin for the big screen. DareDevil comes to the screen as he is in the comics, making it a cracker for Marvel fans out there. Thumbs up for a top film.",Daredevil
653,dalekchris-112-690039,Literally Half Good,5,1 May 2013,"I don't think I've seen a film more split down the middle than Daredevil's Directors Cut. The Good and the Bad come out pretty much exactly even, which is really unusual. Therefore, this movie really isn't worth your time, unless you're a big fan of the character like me and want to get all depressed about how this film definitely isn't all Daredevil deserved. THE GOOD: Ben Affleck. He's a pretty decent Daredevil. There's some cheese (see bad), but he mostly pulls it off by playing it straight. No nonsense. Jon Favreau is really really funny in this. Actually, the humor as a whole is fantastic. Laugh out loud even. The fight scenes are pretty awesome, despite some over reliance on CGI, which has caused the film to age a bit more than it should. Colin Farrell is having a ball as Bullseye. Absolutely over the top glory. Another case of wonderful humor, though this is much darker. I like it!THE BAD: The cinematography. EVERYTHING IS BLUE! Seriously! What the hell? This ruins the costumes! Daredevil is red, therefore in blue lighting he looks purple! Stop it with the blue and make lights orange or yellow or red so that the superhero looks like he should! The costumes: Aren't red enough, and Bullseye looks kinda dumb at times. I'm not a fan of the leather jacket style taken with Daredevil, and Electra looks all wrong in her one scene as Electra. Jennifer Gardner is not a good Electra. Not that she gets to be Electra very much (she spends most of the film as a love interest who's inexplicably good at fighting, which, thinking about it, is never really explained). That damn play-park scene. If you've seen the movie, you know exactly what I'm talking about. He might as well be wearing a sign on his back saying ""kick me, I'm Daredevil!"". Ugh....So, yeah. Would have been better if it was just a straight adaptation of Born Again, but I suppose this leaves that open to people with more talent, not that Marvel will let that happen.

Unlike spider-men, hulk, x-men, and batman, they didn't change a thing from the comic. They didn't suger coat it either. HE hunted the bad guys down and killed them. He didn't tie them up and wait for the police to arrive. I was a big comic fan growing up so when a movie strays from the the comic I think thats a slap in the face to the people who have read and know the the comic. Take Spider-man for example. His web seemed to shoot right out of his palm like that. But in the comic he had to make web shooters and replace the cartrideges when it ran out. Why stray. Keep it what it was. I don't even want to get into the hulk. It was more then just straying. It was like they reinvented the hole story and the hulk himself.

655,SIGMAdj,Beyond stupid,3,25 January 2005,"First of all, there is one aspect to this movie that is deeply upsetting: Daredevil, in real life, is a lawyer, who is so noble that, when he loses cases, he decides to kill the guy who beat the rap. And the guys he kills aren't even on trial for murder. I'm no liberal, but, I mean... isn't that pretty wrong? Arguments of capital punishment and ""eye-for-an-eye"" aside, doesn't this send a really warped message?Relating more to the stupidity of the movie, this movie asks you to believe that having lost your sense of sight means that your body can withstand the tremendous force of falling twenty flights onto a window-washing platform. I don't care how much ""give"" the platform has - a leg has to be broken to be even plausible. The most likely scenario: You die.Also, apparently we're to believe he can jump twice as far as the world Olympic record for long-jump... because he lost his sight. You heard me.Stupid aspects of the movie such as this one are all justified by the notion that his other four senses have been ""heightened"" by the loss of his vision. Also, the loss of his father and vision have made him become obsessed to the athletic perfection of his body. Also, he sleeps in a water-chamber thing (I have no idea what you call it). So, naturally, that means he is now the greatest athlete in the history of the world. Doesn't that sound plausible to you?I can understand how the movie wants us to say, ""OK, I'll believe that even though I'm not a complete moron and know the things he is doing are impossible."" I even like movies like that from time to time. But this movie goes so far and away beyond plausibility, that (for me) it's impossible to just accept it. It's like asking us to believe that dogs can talk (which is easy to do; see: ""Babe""), while also believing that they have a knowledge of the cosmic universe that goes beyond anything human beings could ever comprehend. It's just asking for too much.Vote: 3/10 (for Garner's attractiveness and Farrell's comedic parts)",Daredevil

She was training herself to use her ""special weapon"", and that scene looks so freaking stupid. The other problems 1: this movie is that the camera moment is not good enough. 2: acting is not good enough. 3: like I just say, the story line sucks. 4: Not as good as the comic 5: That chick's character looks so artificial. 6: The villain is pretty cool at first, but a pussy at last. 7: The action is not good enough. 8: The ending sucks 9: The director should know how to control the action and the love scene and not just trying to focus on the ""pose"". 10: The trailer is better than the movie.

The main character, Matt Murdoc, is articulate, intelligent and very witty. Despite being blind, he takes it upon himself to right the wrongs of the world. In doing so, he meets some ... very interesting characters along the way. If anything justifies renting or even buying this DVD, it should be to see the bad guys.

Well newsflash for you braniacs...no wonder people are staying away from the cinema...inflated food prices, noisy teenagers and cel phone jockeys, and oh yes, the magic of DVD home theater. Why pop the 12-15 bucks ( I live in Vancouver so prices are Canadian ) to watch a cut version that you may or not be able to enjoy...when if u save your money and buy a nice TV and DVD home theater...you can enjoy the beauty of Director's Cuts...oh yes...bask in the glory of a film the way the Director actually wanted you to see it. Not because he was getting a hug bankroll for doing so (well sometimes) but because like in this case the director is actually a fan making a film for the fans. Forget the sappy Hollywood love scene...non-existent in this version...it's dirtier, it's grittier, and it's funnier. This is the version you were meant to see and believe me it's worth buying or renting. If you remotely liked the first movie, then you should love this version. A longer fight scene with Kingpin, actual courtroom scenes, not just snippets, I mean this is the story of a lawyer/vigilante not a law student just dropping in to pass his boss some files. He works real cases and it's included this time round...sure the courtroom stuff isn't true to life but it's a comic book after all...we don't see many blind men jumping from buildings and swinging on flag poles either. This movie is enjoyable and even though Spidey is my 2nd fave comic character...I think Davedevil 1.5 is a better movie than either of the Spidey films or even the Batman series. I mean stop killing off the bad guys...both Bullseye and Kingpin survived to taunt poor Matt in the future...hmm and what of Green Goblin, Dr. Ock, The Joker, and Penguin...face down in cinematic history is where they are...who thought that up? I mean Elektra is supposed to die and be reborn that's her origin...but somebody better set these other director's straight on comic book lore...Mark Steven Johnson my hat off to you for bringing us the cream of Marvel's movies from comics. the top 5 being X-men, Blade, Daredevil, Spider-man and of course Spider-man 2. Until my tattoos fade and my skin starts to rot make mine Marvel (I have an awesome Ghost Rider tattoo...waiting on the flick baby)...peace out comic fans.",Daredevil
660,tvargulish,The Worst Super Hero movie yet,4,10 February 2005,"With the popularity of comic book movies, especially Marvel, it was only a matter of time before DareDevil came out. And I sincerely wish it hadn't. This is the worst super hero movie I've seen to date (I haven't seen Elektra yet but I don't expect much). Ben Affleck's portrayal of The Man without Fear is fair, although he is not the person I would have thought of for the role. Colin Farell's over the top acting gets annoying, and why the hell is the KingPin being played by Michael Clarke Duncan!? That aside DareDevil's flaw is that it really didn't capture the essence of the popular characters (perhaps this is due in fact to Mark Steven Johnson trying to cram the three most popular characters in DareDevil all into one movie). DareDevil appears overly violent, as in the beginning when he kills two rapists that are let off as innocent, by throwing them in front of a train, yet lets the KingPin live in the end! Two rapists he doesn't even know should get thrown in front of a train but the man that killed his father should just get to go to jail? Why do directors always mess with the costumes in these movies? Bullseye asks the Kingpin for a costume and in the next scene we see him wearing... well pretty much the exact same thing, a trench coat with a bullseye on his head, because that's not too obvious. Overall, the movie seems more like an Evanesance music video rather than a worthwhile attempt at a DareDevil movie. Fans of the comic stay away, fans of super hero movies stay away, fans of loud rock music and cheesy one-liners enjoy.",Daredevil
661,ZippysKingdom,A Different Opinion,7,3 July 2005,"I'm obviously in the minority here but I just watched the Director's Cut and hated it. The original movie, while no Oscar contender, was simply a good action flick. The Director's Cut dumbed down the movie by adding a pointless sub-plot that distracted from the main story line. While others say that the added scenes ""fleshed out"" the characters I totally disagree. If you can read between the lines you can easily figure out those details on your own.The Director's Cut also added a lot of utterly unnecessary scenes like the part towards the end where the reporter approaches Matt and tells him he is about to reveal the story. What the!?!?  the original version handles this issue much better! You just aren't sure right up to the end and then you see the human behind the reporter when he hits the delete key.While I could care less about the love scene in the original cut, the development of the love interest is much more crucial to the development of the story than others give credit for. If it was not for the love interest then why would Daredevil bother to go after her to protect her? Why would he suffer so much anguish when he thinks she is dead? Why would he have such a smile when he finds the brail charm? Overall, the Director's Cut dragged on in places it should not have, added 24 minutes of nothing to the movie and left out some important details.Hearing the Director talk about his directors cut made me think of someone who wanted to stuff whatever *he* wanted into the movie without regard for the viewer.See both versions and decide.",Daredevil
662,TheSnerd,Maybe I would have liked it if I hadn't read the comic.,3,15 September 2005,"Overstock.com had it on sale for three bucks so I went for it. Of course, I am pretty sure that it was one of those ""I'm trashed and it's 4am, let's shop on the internet"" purchases. I am still trying to figure out if I was ripped off or not. I could have bought a couple of tacos with that money, you know! Since the end result of tacos or Daredevil work out to be pretty much the same, I guess can't complain. I wish I could cue up the sound of a toilet flushing to drive my point home a little more.I like to get the quick and easy comments out of the way so I'll start with the good:Colin Farrell was funny as Bullseye and I liked the Kingpin. OK! That was fun. Let's move on to the bad stuff:It is best viewed with the mute button on. EvanohdearlordIhatethemance had, not one, but TWO songs that played in parts of the movie that were highly inappropriate. That band makes me want to rip my ears off and eat them as it is. Mix them in with Affleck, in a red leather suit, and you have 57 flavors of wrong. The poor choices in film scoring made what could have been a dramatic and touching scene, comical and painful. SPOILER ALERT!!!! I should not have been giggling and pointing at the television during the scenes where people died. Thank you very little, you annoying band that I can't stand (or spell). Actually, I really shouldn't blame the band, too much. The movie would have sucked with a proper film score. I knew that Affleck would be horrible, so that didn't surprise me at all. Sadly, he spit out lines, at times, that made him sound like a melodramatic version of the Tick (the animated one). ""JUSTICE! ROAR!"" All I needed was for Arthur to show up and I would have felt complete. Matt Damon could have made a cameo as Arthur. OK, I just freaked myself out with that mental imagery. Moving on. As for Elektra, she bored me to tears with the exception of one scene: When she beat the snot out of a bunch of sandbags in an attempt to dramatically train for revenge, I thought I was going to die. I was laughing so hard that it felt like my spleen was going to eject itself from my body. Do not ask me what that means. Spleen ejecting is some serious stuff. Do not attempt it. Don't give in to the madness. I digress. Back to the scene that would have embarrassed William Shatner: I blame the director for that one. It was sloppy and pathetic. Actually, THAT would have been the time to play that damned EvanIstillhatethemence song. Either one would have worked. Wait, maybe they were playing them. I had the mute button on, in full effect, at that point.If you like Frank Miller's version of Daredevil, avoid this tripe at all costs. How hard would it have been to make a decent movie out of this? He had the groundwork all laid out in the comic book.I would review the rest of the movie, but I have to go find my spleen.",Daredevil

665,luiga,"A very dark movie different to other ""superhero movies""",4,11 August 2003,"This movie was a big disappointment to me. Since I'm new to the Daredevil series and didn't know the character before, I expected a story much more similar to other famous superheros, Spider-Man, Superman i.e. a story about a special gifted man that uses his abilities to help people, and of course, doing a lot of cool stuff at the same time.Daredevil takes place in a much darker world, and with a much darker outcome. Daredevil himself uses his abilities only to satisfy himself, and his own needs for revenge. He doesn't save innocents, he kills those he thinks are guilty.Daredevil is in many ways much more like Batman than other feel-good superhero movies like the before mentioned Spider-Man and Superman. But even darker than Batman, because Batman is more a fantasy world with fantasy characters. Daredevil is in real-world with business gangsters and rapists. And there are no happy endings. Only new beginnings with changed pasts.",Daredevil
666,guptasa1,Probably my favorite superhero movie of all time!,10,23 February 2003,"I've read a lot of reviews of DareDevil, and I have to say I'm confused. People seem to either love it or hate it.  I'm the former - I thought this movie rocked!  I've seen it twice, may see it again, and will almost certainly buy both the soundtrack and the DVD.  I'm also really hoping for a sequel.  It's really that good!I should say that I never read the DareDevil comics and only was a little bit familiar with the character from The Trial of the Incredible Hulk (which was a good movie in its own right, and even then the character left a lasting impression on me).  That said, one of the biggest complaints I've heard was that this movie isn't completely and utterly true to the comic books.  Some of the events have changed somewhat, and some of the characters have too (such as Kingpin not being white and Bullseye not having his comic-book costume).  I think what one needs to understand when going into a movie like this is that some changes are INEVITABLE.  Movie makers have to be able to tell a story in one sitting to people who are sometimes unfamiliar with the comics, and sometimes that means altering the story a bit to be able to do that well.  I thought the story was great, and I was very happy that it was easily understandable without reading the comics. As far as the other changes, the transition from comic-book to live-action isn't an easy one.  Frankly, translating all the costumes would have probably made it cheesier (though DareDevil's costume and the others they did bring over looked very good to me and not cheesy).  I also doubt anyone could do a better job as Kingpin than Duncan.  In fact, I read they tried several white actors as Kingpin - it just didn't work, and in my opinion they made the best choice possible with him - he's great!Like many others here, I was nervous about Affleck as DareDevil.  Don't get me wrong - I always thought he was a good actor, but as a superhero? Maybe it was his love of the character as a boy or maybe it was because I'd never seen him in a role like this before (had anybody?), but I thought he did an incredible job!  After seeing the movie, I can't imagine someone else doing it much better.  He's great, convincing, and the dark portrayal of his character is dead-on in my view!  The rest of the casting is also great. Bullseye (love his facial expressions), Elektra, and all of the others have a lot of personality and again are cast perfectly in my opinion.  If I had to recast this movie, frankly I wouldn't.  I think they nailed it the first time.The special effects are also very good from the jumps and flashy moves to DareDevil's sensory experiences.  They were tasteful, not overused, and didn't look fakey.  At some points it was possible to tell when something was CGI, but even then it wasn't overly obvious.just subtle clues.  It's also a relief that everything wasn't a special effect.  There's a real story behind this movie, and the special effects were used to tell that story and treat the viewer instead of becoming the main focus of the movie (see the new Star Wars movies to see an example of using too many special effects with not enough story).Fight scenes are fast-paced and flashy - just the way I think DareDevil should move.  They're very entertaining and satisfying but again move the story along instead of becoming the focus.The music for this movie is fast-paced and heavier than most superhero movies, and while this is a matter of taste, I really enjoyed the change. I thought given the movie's setting and gritty feel it fit very well, and I quite enjoyed most of the songs featured.  Sound effects were also done exceptionally well, especially in DareDevil's sensory experiences.Was this movie perfect in my mind?  No, but I haven't run across a movie yet that is.  It's pretty close though.  I felt a few very MINOR nuances could have been elaborated or explained better or should have been changed slightly, and I wished it was longer.  So yes, I would have changed a few things, but very few.  Some small questions about the DareDevil character were left in my mind, but some careful thought reveals several possibilities, and this adds a bit of mystery to the movie, whether intentional or not.I loved this movie!  I'd even go so far to say it's one of the best-done, darkest, moodiest superhero movies to date.  While I also loved Spider-Man and liked X-Men, my preference has always run towards darker superheroes like Batman.  Unfortunately, none of the movies in the Batman franchise have really captured him well in my mind (with the possible exceptions of the first two Batman movies, movies which I like but still don't think measure up to DareDevil).  I'm a big fan of the 90's Batman Animated Series (probably one of the darkest non-anime cartoon series around and much darker...and better in my opinion...than ANY of the Batman movies), and in my mind DareDevil was the first live-action movie that really captured the same type of darkness for me as in that animated series I love so much.To sum it up, as long as you like superheroes and can get over the fact that this movie is based on, but not COMPLETELY consistent with, the comic books (and what is? - the Batman movies aren't, and neither are new series like Smallville), you'll really enjoy this movie.  Just go in without too many preconceptions and expectations so you don't ruin it for yourself, and hopefully you'll walk out with a smile on your face like I did.  And oh yeah - stay for the credits.  I rate this movie a 9.8 out of 10.  Almost perfect. Go Marvel!",Daredevil

669,sanditrixx,Huge Disapointment,5,25 June 2003,"I was right to be skeptical about the casting of Ben Affleck as Daredevil - he was awful.  His acting, his build, his physical presence and moves during the fight scenes were all terrible.  Even with the aid of computers and trick photography he looked slow and not a very impressive martial artist. His leather S&M suit was bad, too.  The overall story was weak as well. The rest of the cast was decent, although Duncan's performance wasn't confident enough to convey the Kingpin's knowledge that he pulls all of the strings, always.  But in the end it's Affleck that ruins it.  Not recommended.",Daredevil
670,bkramps,Time is of the Essence,7,21 February 2003,"While Daredevil was a relatively successful attempt to bring another comic book character to the big screen, as many reviewers have noted, there are many flaws.  His origin and early days seem to be rushed or skipped over. He seems to jumps from newly blinded child to 30-something vigilante/lawyer in a matter of minutes, to fans of comics and good movies this can be extremely frustrating.  The reason why Daredevil and most other comic book movies contain so many flaws and leaps in time is due to the movie's length.
The comic book medium is being treated in the film medium like an action film.  This means lots of action/fighting, onslaughts of CGI special effects, and an attention span of about 1 1/2 hours.  Although the actual individual comic books may seem like 25 page fast-action books, they are really just a part of an epic.  The Daredevil, Spider-Man, X-Men, Batman, etc comics are more similar to epic novels than single books.  Daredevil is not a 25 page book, it is hundreds of books filled with thousands of pages. When film companies decide to represent thousands of pages in an hour and a half, they are destined to fail on many levels.  It would be absurd to try and fit Gone with the Wind or even The Lord of the Rings into that sparse amount of time.  Those are epic novels and thankfully the film companies have treated them as such.  Both of those films (counting all of the Rings as one huge film) will stand the test of time and will satisfy most of the ardent readers of the respective novels.  When the decision to make the Lord of the Rings into three 3hr movies was made, the film had already taken the first step toward infinity.  It is a shame that comic books will never be seen in that same light.Daredevil is a franchise that deserves at least 2hrs of film time.  It is even more important to have time when one must develop four major characters.  There is virtually nothing done to develop the two villains, and that is the film's biggest downfall.  One could argue that there will be sequels to further tell the Daredevil story and that is a valid point. The problem lies in how the sequel is told.  A successful sequel needs to elaborate on the main character and themes from the first film while also telling a new story.  This can be best seen in The Godfather 2 or The Two Towers. Most likely, though, the sequel will be a remake of the first film with a new villain (see Blade 2 or Batman and Robin).  This is adding nothing to the epic story, it is just making the hero into a one-dimensional fighting machine.The best path for comic book movies would be to make a longer first film that concentrates on the origin of the hero and development of the villain. If that is done, then the sequel can focus on the action and the new villain.  In essence, one must view the genre as more of a drama than an action film.  Probably the most successful comic to movie ever, Batman, followed this formula.  It was a little over two hours and the viewer learned not only Batman's origins but also the Joker's.  Daredevil tried to pack too much into too little of a time.  One must learn that epics cannot be told in an hour and a half.  They must be treated with respect and given time to develop.  Daredevil was a valiant attempt but ultimately it came up short (pun definitely intended). Hopefully the DVD will fill in the gaps of the screened film.  **1/2",Daredevil
671,eskravitz,An excellent comic adaptation for those who like this sort of thing.,9,11 February 2003,"I went into Daredevil with the same trepidation that I felt before seeing Spiderman...i.e. will the film makers do the comic justice.  The answer, again, is a resounding yes.  Though the plot is somewhat sparse, remember it's an adaptation of a COMIC BOOK!  If you don't like that kind of thing, there may not be much for you here.  If you do, you will have a good time. The acting was adequate (and just as I couldn't see Tobey Macguire as Spidey, Ben Affleck pulled off portraying ol' Horny just fine), the soundtrack rocks (for the most part) and the special effects were excellent. The fight scenes were actually better than in Spiderman and left most everyone in the audience breathless.  A final caution for parents out there...again, like in Spiderman, this is not a film for young children and really does earn its PG-13 rating...it is dark and gritty and at times morally ambiguous...but loads of fun.",Daredevil
672,toufuelo,It was Okay,1,17 February 2003,"It wasn't as good as I was hoping, but it was leaps and bounds ahead of the worst comic book movie ever made(Batman and Robin).  It kind of felt like the first X-Men movie to me.  To me it felt a little rushed; trying to condense 40 years of comic book history into two hours.  I think it needed a little more character development, more moments in the costume, and longer fight scenes.  I also didn't like the music in the film and maybe it just my theater, but the movie was very dark visually.  Sometimes I could hardly make out what was happening on screen.  I mean in the TV spots and trailers, the same scenes were a little bit brighter and clearer.",Daredevil

I'm not one of those über nerds that goes bananas when a movie doesn't follow the original comic story perfectly. But there are so many great elements in this comic, that it should be hard to miss them altogether, which is the case here.I guess the casting of non-actor Affleck as the hero should have warned me. Or the lousy art work for that matter. Jennifer Garners Electra-goes-Barbie performance is insulting. She's actually even better in the goofy spin off Electra. There is no chemistry between them whatsoever. The visual effects poor to say the least. The soundtrack is a mess. The stupid costume is a non-funny joke.

675,rhodenizer,Hitting a BLIND GUY!,4,12 August 2003,"Ok I watched Daredevil when it came out on DVD. I was hoping for the best but was very disappointed. The main problem with the script I had was the relationship between Daredevil and Elektra. She meets Daredevils alter ego Matt Murdock in a coffee shop when he tries to hit on her. After she shoots him down and finds out he is blind she leaves. He follows her and a fight seen starts. Now in case you have not picked up on this yet she is beating up a BLIND GUY. Am I the only person who has a problem with her beating up a BLIND GUY now yes he is Daredevil and has the ability to fight her off but she does not know that. So she is a girl who likes going around and beating up physically challenged people. So let me guess in the Elektra spin off movie she is going to go and beat up people in wheel chairs. Also the movie was rushed along there was not enough time to build up the love story between Daredevil and Elektra. Colin Farell was good with what little screen time he did have ans so was Michael Clarke Duncan as king pin. The action scenes were alright but nothing to write home about. But ultimately the failure in the movie is the rushed pace and the lack of chemistry between Ben Afleck and Jennifer Garner. Now I have seen Jennifer have chemistry on Alias with her co-stars. But lets think when was the last time Ben had chemistry with a woman on screen. I think Ben needs to stay to just the action with no accents please (Pearl Harbor or Gigli) the romance department is just not his thing can we all remember the failures of Pearl Harbor, Bounce, and now the travesty that is Gigli.",Daredevil

678,raulaura,Marvel's attempt at recreating DC's Batman. (***beware Spoilers),6,14 February 2003,"Marvel had to answer with their version of Batman, and you can definitely see the similarities in both stories.  In the Comic Book world of heroes, Daredevil is a character that has a mixed following, those who love him and those who hate him.  This similarity can also be seen in the film's mixed reviews.  Definitely not for the kiddies, tons of violence, I like that. 13 and over, yeah, you can take them.  A definite guy flick. Lots of great Action with cool sound and cool visuals.  I took my wife to see it on Valentines Day.  She thought the prologue could have been shorter, I agree. The story should have just started with Matt Murdock as a child instead of as a flashback sequence (that was way to drawn out). Daredevil at times seemed as though it made fun of itself with some cheesy lines, and Hong Kongesque action comedy.  I didn't mind it though.  Ben Affleck was his usual dull self and at times not convincing enough as a blind guy.   The suit didn't help his cause much either.  Jennifer Garner was a perfect casting call as Elektra, which allowed her to display some of her action prowess (not to mention nice wire work).  Jon Favreau supplied the much needed comic relief with ease.  Michael Clarke Duncan used a much deeper voice to nail a Kingpin role down pat.  Colin Farrell was way over the top but fitting as Bullseye (be sure to stick around during the credits).  Joe Pantoliano's character was a pleasant surprise.   All in all, no Oscar Nominees here, but if all you want is some eye (and ear) candy, it is well worth $8.50.  It was as good as I expected, no surprises.  I gave it a 6 out of 10.",Daredevil

But he has fights on the playground, attends fancy society parties, and hangs out with a rich girl. Chickens and wine did not pay for that apartment either. The radar effects were the best thing about this movie. This movie was not made for children and was not written for adults.

Doesn't spend the same amount of time that Spiderman does telling the story and I think is better for it - though for those who want the whole deal this won't matter and they will have enjoyed the full comic on screen in Spiderman.  Enough of those comparisons - Daredevil manages to bring some credibility to Ben Afleck (you can tell I'm not a fan!) and he does a decent job of being our blind hero. The special effects are pretty good, but the rain thing comes accross as a bit cheesy - rain allows Daredevil to 'see'.  The vision from sound is well portrayed and the DVD should be great if a decent DTS soundtrack is included.  Being a Brit, the guy in the Pub who throws out Bullseye is sickening.  The Dick Van-Dyke accent was acceptable 50 years ago but not now - come on Hollywood - there are plenty of good (if not original) London accents around now.

Sure there's been some liberties taken, but that's to be expected. Some things don't translate from Comic to Screen very well.Matt Murdock (Daredevil) is played by Ben Affleck, a blind lawyer by day and a vigilante by night.  Say what you want about the other films he's been in, but he IS Matt Murdock in this one.  Most of the time I didn't even notice that it was Affleck, he's that close to the perfect Matt Murdock.  If you're skeptical about this, read ""Guardian Devil"" (the first story arc in Daredevil Vol. 2, written by Kevin Smith in 1998, the introduction is written by Ben Affleck) and then watch the movie again.  Admittedly Affleck isn't going to win an Oscar for his role, but he made Murdock believable.Sure the Kingpin is black in the movie and white in the comics.  But with Affleck as Daredevil, Kingpin needed to be more imposing than him. Affleck is 6'2"".  Name an actor who is taller than that, physically imposing, deep voice, white, and can act.  I can't think of one.  In fact, the only one who comes to mind at all is Duncan.Bullseye looks nothing like he does in the comics.  But then again, the Bullseye costume would look just as ridiculous on screen as Wolverine's costume would in the X-Men movies.  Some will complain that Colin Farrell was too over the top, to those critics I say, ""That's what the Bullseye character IS.""Some will complain about the lack of screen time for Jennifer Garner and Joe Pantoliano.  Those people also don't know much about Daredevil.  Elektra, although she plays a major role in the Daredevil story, really isn't in all that many of the comic books.  Urich, although not playing as important a role as Elektra, usually doesn't appear for more than a few panels at a time (when he appears at all).  They shouldn't have (and don't really need) too much more screen time than they got.My only complaints on the movie are minor.  The music (please make it stop), and that Ben Urich works for the New York Post (why?).This is no Spider-Man story.  It's dark, very violent, and even grittier. In other words, watch this movie for yourself before allowing young kids to see it.  But if you liked the first Batman movie and both of the Blade movies, you'll love Daredevil.",Daredevil
684,kosnicarevicaleksandar,This movies is PAINFUL BAD,1,14 November 2021,"I had my tonsils removed but that is low pain compared to what I felt while watching this piece of garbage.Best scene is this movies is when rain starts outtaaa nowhere.Garabage so much, my eyes hurt from watching this...
Better watch ""Poslednja Trka"" or ""Skolska Ljubav"" on youtube.",Daredevil
685,The_Vicious_DB,Entertaining as hell,5,24 February 2003,"""Daredevil"" is not a ""deep"" movie, nor is it directing at its best. However, it is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen recently. It is more entertaining than ""Spider-Man"", though ""Spider-Man"" is a better movie. There are excellent points in the film, and Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have excellent chemistry, and that helps propel the film dramatically. ""Daredevil"" also comes closest to having a love scene in a comic book inspired movie.The best part of the film is the special effects and the fight scenes. The choreography is excellent, and Daredevil's ""radar sense"" (He, being a blind man, uses his acute sense of hearing to ""see"" his surroundings, much like a sonar ""sees"") is rendered amazingly in the film. Although there are a couple quick shots during fight scenes that look a little fake and computerized, but they appear far enough in to the movie that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief.All in all, Daredevil is an extremely entertaining and spectacularly rendered venture. Chalk up another win to Marvel Comics and its movie division.",Daredevil
686,amcque,wow I can't believe it,1,15 February 2003,"Daredevil happens to be made after a comic book but the movie still looks so unreal.  When most of the people jump they can jump like 12 feet high and 20 feet long.  Also when the jumps are shown you can totally tell it is animation.  Although spider-man may be a little far fetched itself, it still has a great storyline and it gives possible reasons for why peter parker can jump high and far and crawl, and so forth.  I expected a movie way better than spider-man but this movie happens to be a lot worse.  I know they spent a lot of time and money on it but I say its not worth seeing.",Daredevil
687,rupy_,74 mil budget and they deliver this?,4,1 May 2003,"74 million dollars and they produce this garbage?

688,nils01,Another excellent job of comic to screen,9,14 February 2003,"Let me start off by saying that this movie could have been extremely bad.Someone could have taken Daredevil and completely screwed it up, but thankgod for the devotion and attention to detail that the filmmakers had when making Daredevil.  I've heard people bitch about Elektra's costume and Kingpin being black...WHO CARES!!!! these characters are well done and true to their comicbook roots.  The film moves along at a steady pace which is good, although Iwish it would have taken it's time to develop Matt's and Elektra's relationship a little more and also more of Bullseye would have been great, but all together this is a very well put together film.",Daredevil
689,MrOrange88,"Really Good Movie(could be spoilers, i doubt it)",6,2 August 2003,"(There maybe some spoilers)Many people would trash this movie simply on its Special Effects.  I believe that if a movie can tell a good story and make my mind believe what is going on without causing me to lose focus, then it has done its job, and that is what Daredevil did.Daredevil recreates the story that was started over 40 years ago and sticks well to the comic book.  The fighting scenes were great and looked amazing. Colin Farrell's portrayal as Bullseye was one of the best performances as a villain since Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman.  Ben Afleck was a great choice for Matt Murdock and delivered well.The only problems with this movie were its Special Effects at the final fight between Bullseye and Daredevil and a few shots of Daredevil hopping around.  Taking into consideration of all of the other effects used, I was very pleased with the outcome especially since the production team was running out of time when making the film.This film told a better story than that of the Spider-Man movie. Spider-Man is my favorite super hero, but the movie dragged on at some points. Daredevil was an all out fast paced action movie and deserves 4 1/2 stars.",Daredevil
690,jgl_girl,Kane Hodder only good point.,1,7 May 2003,I only went to go see this movie because my favorite actor is in it(Kane Hodder).He was excellent and looked amazing.But the movie flat out sucked.I gave this movie a 2 and thats only because of Kane.If he wasn't in it I would give that crap a 0.,Daredevil
691,foxsamdinopepper,Fun,8,1 May 2007,"I thought this movie was actually kind of fun. I did not bother to see it for the longest time. My husband had it so one night I blew the dust off the case and gave it a try. I was not that disappointed with it, but pleasantly surprised. I went into it not knowing much about the Daredevil character. I never read the comic. X-Men was my choice to read. Things I liked about it was the way they filmed things from his view. The graphics for it were cool. Not over done but still fun to watch. I also liked the way he handles the 'bad guys'. He is more like a Wolverine as opposed to a Scott Summers. He resembles the Punisher character which is another surprise hit for me. So if you get a chance, check it out. Just don't take it seriously and it will entertain you!",Daredevil
692,rhyle,Does exactly what it says on the tin.....,8,14 February 2003,"....and nails it.Okay, I admit, due to a love of things Askew I was always going to mark out a little over this, but Mark Steven Johnson gave me something I wasn't expecting:Daredevil. Not a new, box office friendly version, but the gritty Frank Miller Daredevil that aging comic book fans like myself were hoping for. That's not the only good news. Ben Affleck turns in an exemplary performance as ol' hornhead. From the humour inherent in his exchanges with Foggy to the posture and stances of the man without fear....Affleck gets it down.Elektra......Jennifer Garner. Mixing two objects of my lust (one in my formative years, one a bit more recent...) and expecting me to understate the look of this character is a bridge to far for me. The new history is a bit much, and the love story treats Elektra with an especially large ham fist, but the way she looks, moves and fights just blows you away. Straight from the comic book to the screen. Exactly what was ordered.Both Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan do very well in very limited roles. Bullseye does not get enough screen time....but if you're after an actor having fun and inventive ways to kill a man, then look no further. I've become very nervous around paper clips.... The Kingpin has obviously been introduced as a potentially recurring character in a franchise...no history, no real character development, it will be interesting to see what they do with him in the second film (which must be all but a certainty).Time for the negatives. Only two: the cheesy love story and clumsy religious imagery. The second being particularly unnecessary. I mean....stigmata like wounds in a church? Ouch.....There has also been criticism of the ending. One of the friends I watched this with (he has a film degree which explains a lot) suggested that its ending is too marketing oriented....leaves too many questions unanswered. My answer was this: Daredevil has been going for over 30 years. There will be second movie. If you resolve every issue, what would be the point of the sequel?If you're a fan, I don't need to tell you to go see this movie....if you're not, or don't even know who Daredevil is, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",Daredevil
693,karenrobb,Dulldevil,3,19 February 2003,"This movie should be renamed Dulldevil. As a fan of comic book movies, I went in with an open mind, very willing to suspend my disbelief. I found the acting to be dull, with Ben Affleck walking around more like a man trying to work out how he got into this movie in the first place, rather than a blind man. Colin Farrel, as one of the major adversaries, was as scary as a homicidal chipmunk. The writers of Daredevil could have done a lot better, as they gave him a darker feel, with his violent vigilante activities, but it just went nowhere. The action sequences were ok, but nothing special. I always had the feeling that wires were about. Nothing felt natural. And just what was it about DD's feet hitting the ground? They must have had about 10 close-up shots of it throughout the movie. Give this movie a miss.",Daredevil
694,Coldbeverage,Brilliant,10,16 February 2003,"I loved this movie. Ignore anyone who makes comparisons of Daredevil with Spiderman - which, in my opinion was quite different. Granted, they both have their inevitable similarities (both coming from Marvel comic books - and story outlines of normal kid accidentally morphing into superhero). Daredevil is quite obviously aiming at a more specific audience here, while Spiderman was for everyone - it DARES to be different (excuse the pun) and sets a much darker tone. In my opinion the characters were much more complex than those of Spiderman and keeps you wondering, while there was a fair bit of emotion weaved into it all. Acting was good too. If you are going to see this movie, please walk into the cinema with an open mind, pretend you haven't seen any other similar comic book movies in the genre, and enjoy Daredevil for what it is - a clever, dark, daring, fast-paced, emotional action movie that screams for a fantastic sequel.",Daredevil
695,zebulan_zackary,Too much technology for their own good.,2,15 February 2003,"This movie was reaching way beyond what the director was capable of creating. There was so much cheesy CGI stuff (an extraneous CGI rat, Bendy straw CGI acrobats, CGI cables used for scaling buildings). There were several occasions where things just didn't line up (girl gets scratched on the neck with a playing card and is stunned to immobility, but gets run through the hand with a tsai and she whips it out of her hand and starts fighting back like it was nothing). The few fight scenes that aren't CGI are so poorly choreographed and acted out that I just had to grunt in my seat and rub my forehead. Daredevil should have been directed by Ang Lee as a Martial arts movie, but what it turned into was a movie failing to turn every day actors into martial arts stars through CGI trickery.",Daredevil

699,colinodonnell,ewwww.,4,23 September 2007,"First off, I'm sorry, but this just ruined Daredevil for me. His career in the movie business is shot thanks to some of the crappiest acting comic book movies have ever seen.What was Jennifer Garner doing when she practically hissed at Ben Affleck during the fight scene later on in the film? Seriously. It was almost laughable. She looked ridiculous, sounded ridiculous, and destroyed the heat of the moment. Elektra's character also takes a very random turn for the worse in the latter part of the movie, so it isn't one hundred percent her fault, but she could've done much better portraying her feelings of anger. After the death of her father, she has a right to be absolutely furious, but the way Garner tried to accent her anger is just plain silly.And what the hell (pardon my French) was Colin Ferrel doing in this movie at all? I understand that Bullseye is a very deranged character and would be a difficult role to fulfill, but the way Ferrel acted this time around was downright creepy. He went a bit too far for me.Ben Affleck did a pretty good job playing Matt Murdock. Daredevil's abilities are really cool and he's a very flashy character. Affleck had the blind man's way of doing things down and it looked the way it should have--Murdock has eased his life into a routine he does every day to make sure that he gets to work on time, dresses correctly, and always has a costume ready to jump into. Affleck did a good job portraying not only the blind lawyer, but the vigilante. Daredevil's actual appearances and fight scenes were awesome. But with the slight ridiculousness of the concept, who would be able to help but make the movie a little corny or weird during parts? All around, Affleck did the best job, but the plot was too senseless and the acting was too all over the place for this movie to really do a solid job.",Daredevil

I'm happy to say that it doesn't dissapoint.Although not entirely faithful to the comics, DD does a good job recreating what I've been reading over the years. The actors are cast pefectly (Colin steals the show as Bullseye), the action is top notch, and the story is entertaining.My only problems with the movie are the pacing, and the music. It seems they tried to fit too much into a short amount of time, so the pacing is a little fast. Also, the music doesn't fit the movie at all. It sometimes distracts you, making you wonder why they ever chose that piece of music.I'm not sure why it's rated PG-13, it's certainly graphic enough to be rated R.I give it an 8 out of 10, and recommend it to anyone who's a comic fan, or anyone who loves a good action flick.",Daredevil

705,Old Chris Kenobi,"The Best Super-hero movie, as of late.",10,19 February 2003,"I must say, my expectations were quite low for Daredevil after seeing Spiderman last year.  I figured every super-hero movie would now be some happy, go-go flick, filled with terrible acting, cheesy villians and special effects to cover the mess up.Well, Daredevil shattered all these pre-conceived ideas within the first five minutes.  The movie is darker than Spiderman, and seemed to be aimed at a more mature audience.  Ben Affleck, contrary to popular belief, can play a super hero quite well, and the cameos of Kevin Smith and Stan Lee were enjoyable to witness.All in all, this movie was just great.  The fight scenes blew me away, the narration at the beginning was excellent and if it wasn't for the unrealistic smoothness of CGI, and Collin Farrel (Brad Pitt wannabe), I would have placed this film above many of my current favourites.Go see it.  Do not pay attention to the negative hype people keep throwing at this flick.  Affleck is 400 times the actor Toby will ever be, and say good bye to most of the super hero cheese you witnessed in that overrated Spidey flick that picked up $400 million.  I guarantee you it will tie you down for mind blowing action sequences and super hero flicks until The Matrix Revolutions and X2 emerge to steal the crowns respectively in mid-May.",Daredevil

707,lilsteviedogg,What happens what Ben puts his name on stuff!,5,21 February 2003,"I've decided to unleash my movie ideas and thoughts to writing so you all can enjoy and reward yourselves by reading what I think about certain movies. I feel very strongly about movies and I never give credit were credit is not do. I will say my articles will not be grammatically correct or even politically correct so if you don't like what I write, don't read it. These are my opinions and I'm just sharing them with the world. With that being said I begin my movie critic career with a review of DaredevilUp to this point, putting Ben Affleck in any movie almost guarantees a hit at the box office.This movie fits into that category. Yes ladies I do agree Ben was the hot ticket in Hollywood  even before he snagged J-lo so with that being said let the gauntlet be thrown down.. My expectations going into the film were very low (being 2 exactly on my very diverse and challenging scale of 10). Being the average fan of having no prior knowledge of Daredevil, and only having Spiderman to compare too, it would be hard for Ben to overcome the appeal of Kirsten Dunst (look at those dimples). But after you see the cleavage that Jen Garner brings to the camera you'll be quick to forget about those dimples. The only problem is they take her through 3 life crisis situations in a matter of 10 minutes of film time. Colin Farrell actually played a half decent villain. But is still no William Defoe. The speed of these events takes away from the reality of actually letting it sink in to the viewer of what just happened. But `REVENGE'(my favorite plot line) comes into the picture and any movie that is based on revenge at least has a good plot line. Great special effects made Ben into what he needed to be and having a co star be a she-male and make Lara Croft look like `Winnie' from the Wonder Years made for pretty good action scenes.(I haven't seen Sai's used like that since Raphael whoop Casey Jones's butt in the park.)  I can say that I still have no enthusiasm to pick up a comic book and read the back story I CAN say I was entertained for 2 hours. One of the most startling things about this movie is that they made KINGPIN a black man. I actually loved this for  a few reasons. 1: physically there is no ONE (black or white) man that resembles the kingpin from the comic. With the exception of Fat Joe( which if I see one more rapper in a film I think I'll puke.)2: Michael Duncan Clark has the personality and the physical appearance to be a master criminal.(A.K.A. King of All the Bad Stuff). Plus the only thing he had to be was `huge' to fit the role which he obviously is (A.K.A. John Coffey) Plus I love the fact that the writers actually had the audacity to do that. 20 years ago they would have lost many `white viewers` ( people who live south of New York City) but with  the coming of age they've actually made a very smart economic breakthrough. Giving a WHITE role to a BLACK man. Dog treats to that guy. Putting all these aspects together in one movie at least entertains you  the time you watch it. And for you guys out  there ( white or black) all you need is a view of Jen's cleavage and you'll be content with that. So out of 10 I give it 5 dog paws and I would advise the majority to see it ONCE in the theater, rent ONCE on dvd and only buy it if it comes out with a special `ONCE' edition with ALOT of added features. So I will keeping paying to see Ben Affleck movies, I will pay extra to see Jen Garner movies, and I will debate whether or not to keep putting myself through comic book movies. With that being said let's see Xmen 2 and Hulk!",Daredevil

But he proves that he is much better than that when he serves justice at night as Daredevil. I dearly love how he does several stunts and tricks.It is exciting to watch him do insane stunts like jumping right off buildings and then regaining his balance. All the stunts are a piece of art!

Some of the acting was a little over the top (Bullseye; Kingpin) but this can be expected from a comic book adaptation.  I thought the playground fight scene was silly at best.I will probably rent it on dvd, though for some mindless entertainment in a couple months.",Daredevil
712,bellard32,Great fun,10,16 February 2003,"Daredevil was a great movie. Pretty awesome special effects, and a story line that fits. I wasn't aware until the movie started that he was a Marvel comic super hero, which made the even more interesting.

713,orville076,It was definitely worth my time even with the few cheesy lines,9,14 February 2003,"Daredevil does what any comic book movie has to do and that is tell the background story. This background story was done quite a bit better than any other superhero movie to this date. It had a good pace and got the point across without leaving any loop holes. The movie itself was extremely entertaining. Of course the cheesy lines were in the movie, but every super hero movie has some here and there. One thing that stuck out in my mind about Daredevil was the fact that it was not a huge commercial movie, no Pepsi advertising or anything. The action in this movie, is at some times far fetched, but otherwise very exciting. The characters fit the movie perfectly, Collin Farrel had to be my favorite because of his overall playful yet angry attitude. Ben Affleck actually did a good job with Daredevil. I am not a fan of Ben at all, but he did his role well. Jennifer Garner fit Elektra perfectly, with the already trained body and the looks it all fell into place just nicely. Mr. Duncan had to be the best suited big man in Hollywood to play Kingpin. He has the attitude, look, and even the cigar smoking down. Bottom line, see the movie, it is worth the time and money and I will even stretch my neck to say it is up there with Spiderman.",Daredevil

And the ending is just fabulous.I recommend it to everyone who ever felt the injustice that surrounds us. The idea of this movie is that there is no good or bad. There is only right or wrong, concepts set by the society. And if you want to make things right you have to fight for it.My rate for this movie is 10/10.

717,hardrockin_supersmurf,Forget DD - X-MEN RULES !!!!,1,24 March 2003,"DAREDEVIL is ABSOLUTE TRASH. No - it is even worse than that. If I could, I would ask the distributor to get my money back.First: somebody should finally tell Ben Affleck that he is not made to be an actor, he has neither charisma nor any presence on screen (I doubt whether he got it at all ...), he simply cannot act. Even I would DARE him in this field! What a mis-casting! None of the characters was ... wait a minute ... CHARACTER - what CHARACTERS? There were no characters: even those who could have been some, like Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell didn´t have the chance to pull off some good performance. There was no chance to identify yourself with one of them or to create some sympathy. Although SPIDERMAN was partly soaked with romanticism, it was a lot easier to feel sympathy for Peter Parker or even Norman Osborne than with Matt Murdock. Then the plot: that what one might call ""plot"" seemed to be individual scenes put together like some patch work by some kid in elementary school. The dialogues were as shallow as they could get. If the movie were a puddle of water, I'd say it is too shallow to even drown an amoeba!Thank goodness, I went to see this s*** in a triple feature night with X-MEN and SPIDERMAN (I have seen both of them already more than 3 times in the theater), so at least I had something to look forward to.To compare all three of them - I can only give X-MEN a first class rating. It´s got a decent cast, good action sequels (not that kind of action overkill XXX revealed), a recognizable plot and even a message.Still, I also find SPIDERMAN a surprisingly good film, especially due to its comic style and the wonderful acting of Tobey Maguire. You had to try to ignore Kirsten Dunst (same league as Mr. Affleck) though.So, for anyone who had the stamina to read through my comment, here is my advise: do not touch (or worse) watch it! To watch it might lead you to displaying a lot of anger about lost time, wasted money and about the fact that there are people getting millions of US$ for creating something like that.

The acting was pathetic, as was the script and the special effects. It clearly looked like a rushed job, I'm sure if you listen carefully you can hear the actors' cell phones ringing, it should have gone straight to viewing on some small airline, but that wouldn't be fair to subject the passengers to that.  The only positive thing to say about the movie was that the character of 'Bullseye' was limited in screen time.",Daredevil

If not for Elektra (Jennifer Garner) and an over the top fun bad guy Bullseye (Colin Farrell), it's what we call a ""Miss This One"".  Wait for it on video, or TV.  There are times when it was boring, but we hung in there as they developed the character, thought it was going to get better, then whoops, it didn't.  It's not the worst movie we've seen, but it's definitely not a buyer.  Ben is a good guy, just not superhero material, he was better as the blind guy.  Hope others enjoy it, just had to give an honest opinion of some frequent moviegoers!!  Sorry :(",Daredevil
720,gilslade,"A misconceived miscarriage of the concept of ""blind justice""",3,20 March 2003,"I entered the theater with certain expectations.  I expected Daredevil to be bad (I'm not a real believer in ""good"" superhero movies) but I also expected Mark Johnson to have a sense of humor.  While Daredevil wasn't exactly renowned for his witty superhero banter, he had wittier comebacks than those he was allowed in the script, also by Mr. Johnson.  Without the ability to mock the genre of action movies in general, such a film as Daredevil loses one of its greatest potential assets. In lieu of good dialogue and witty comments on the media, there was an overabundance of poorly implemented archetypes and symbols.  The Christ imagery in particular was in bad taste (Bullseye's stigmata-esque wounds and his spread arms) even to me, a not-particularly-practicing Presbyterian. What is that supposed to tell us, the audience, anyways?  That Bullseye is somehow making a sacrifice to redeem us?  The second worst was the attempt at a rain motif.  It was, as I interpreted it, an attempt at communicating a renewal of purpose, a rebirth of sorts.  Instead it came across as campy and forced, and that not even in the funny, Roger Corman way. I managed to amuse myself and my moviegoing companion MST3K style, though quietly, fairly easily.  If ever there was a movie in need of a sense of humor, even if imposed upon it by surrogate joke writers, it is Daredevil. Oh yeah, before I forget, I also expect my superheros to be in decent shape, not with man-boobs and a gut.  That was just a horrible casting oversight.  That departure from the comics was, however, more welcome than Electra's death, which was just silly.  I won't discourage  potential viewers because I enjoyed myself, though only by force of will.",Daredevil

I was completely hooked on the film from start to finish, and there was never a dull moment.If you see this film you will wish and start to pretend you are Daredevil.

Don't worry, this isn't one of them.The actor playing the young Matt at the beginning of the film was excellent and I'm sure has a great career in front of him. (I've just looked up his profile, Scott Terra, he's doing ok. LOL)  Ben Affleck played the part with conviction (you sure he's not really blind?).  Jennifer Garner (Happy Valentines Day) was as gorgeous and charismatic as ever.  As for Big Mike, he's so talented, no-one has as much presence, absolute perfection, Wicked baddy!!Bad points?

There's a scene where after a fight Matt Murdock is showering and he's so beaten up, he pulls out a broken tooth and then knocks back some pain pills. I felt that it had a gritty realism to it. The effects were at least on a par with Spidey and in some cases the animated movements looked more natural (I put this down to the night time setting which can allow you to smooth away a lot of the unrealistic stuff).However, the non-costumed fight scenes were poor and looked posed. Also, some of the scenes didn't flow properly and it gave the impression that there was some rushed editting.Overall, good with a seriously cool soundtrack.",Daredevil

Just plain cheezy with a terrible script and horrible acting. Not only did I go to the manager after the movie and demand my $5.50 back, but I also asked him for that 2 hours of my life back. Avoid this movie at all costs. Oh, Planet of the Apes was the worst movie I ever saw in the theatre.",Daredevil
726,skaterboifif,"Actually, A good film. Why the hell is everyone so negative about it?",6,17 February 2003,"Daredevil is PURE entertainment. I think Affleck did a great job as Matt Murdoch. Colin Ferell was great, also. Sure Michael Clarke Duncan was sort of corny, and, yes, sadly Jennifer Garner looked really campy. But you can't take credit away from where credit is due. The visual effects are amazing. So much better than Spiderman. A much darker, more film-noir type espionage than it's Marvel counterpart of last year. Also; as with Spiderman the thrill-a-minute spectacular also produces a killer soundtrack with a variety of tracks from both popular and up and coming artists. The filn does not stray far from its comic roots, which is a good thing, since Kevin Smith has turned Daredevil into a phenomenal realistic superhero rivaling other Marvel Creations like Spiderman and the Uncanny X-Men. Smith's cameo is also quite amusing. As far as skeptics go, Daredevil has a lot. Perhaps the hype can kill a film, but maybe this is due to how hype is related to commercialism. Those of you who know me probably think I'm going to go into one of my anti-commercialism rants now, but I'm merely giving my input on a film. I, for one, have read and enjoyed both the original Daredevil series, and Smith's adaptation. I think the film is a fantastic adaptation of both works. Give credit where credit is due and understand that although the acting may not be phenomenal, at least the film makers had the guts to try something different. They could have easily made $400 million US by doing a cheesy teen romance flick and cast big names like Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire. But instead, the film relays a dark setting. Such as the case, with such a story. Such a comic can not be adapted into a campy film such as Spiderman. Thanks for reading.",Daredevil
727,deacon1074,Colin Farrell and Ben Affleck own their roles!,10,14 February 2003,"Ben Affleck makes you believe that he is Matt Murdock.  His performance is one of his best ever.  You can feel his pain and understand his reasons for his struggle.  He gives Daredevil a sense of realism.  Murdock makes you want to go out and fight for his cause.  His telling himself that he isn't the bad guy resonates throughout everyone who has ever seen or experienced an injustice.  On the complete opposite of this, Colin Farrell is a complete maniac.  Farrell's Bullseye is one of the most charismatic bad guys I've ever seen.  The scene on the airplane was both hilarious and sorta shocking all at once.  You really believe that Colin Farrell is a homicidal sociopath.  I gave this movie as a whole a 10.  Great performances from all of the characters.  Michael Clark Duncan makes a great hulking, menacing Kingpin.  Jennifer Garner as Elektra is A+.  She's buff enough to make her kicking all that ass normal.  GREAT MOVIE!",Daredevil

It succeeds where movies like Spiderman have failed in really giving a true depiction of the hero(or anti-hero in this case possibly) for the audience.  The movie has a real style and grace all it's own and it is a real treat to watch.I thought the depiction of Daredevil to be the best, and I think it is premature and ill-serving to put him off as a ""Shriveled in a one-dimensional role...""  He's a classic conflicted hero and it really comes across well on the screen.  Putting all the seriousness aside, the film was also a lot of fun to watch.  The action sequences were done very well and the special effects (especially the jumping and carousing of buildings) was much better than a certain ""spider movie"" that came out last year.

But Daredevil was the first time that I felt like I was watching a movie about a great character that just happened to be a superhero.  I've never been a big Affleck fan but he was outstanding in this, the role he was born to play.  Jennifer Garner solidifies her status as the hottest chick in movies (and TV!) and Colin Farrel all but steals the show as Bullseye. It's a great time at the movies and I can't wait to buy the DVD.

Although I am not a fan of comics-turned-into-movies, I can highly recommend it. Colin Farrell makes the most of Bullseye and clearly enjoys every minute of it, it's a shame we don't see more of him. Jennifer Garner is really beautiful and convincing as Elektra, a martial arts master and daughter of a Greek tycoon. Ben Affleck manages to play the lead fairly well and you shouldn't trash it before you've seen it. Some may say that he is miscast since Matt Murdock/Daredevil is a hero less sympathetic and in his loneliness and vulnerability more realistic than other Marvel-heros, but (admitting that he isn't very convincing as someone who is blind - that squint didn't convince me...)Ben Affleck's acting and the movie itself is strong enough to tell an exciting, well-crafted story.

It even has some memorable poetic scenes. I believe Ben Affleck lends more depth and plausibility to Daredevil than Christian Bale did to his monosyllabic Batman. Collin Farrell delivers an intriguing and funny superhero movie villain (a rare treat, that was later brought to perfection by his friend Heath). Michael Clarke Duncan and Jennifer Garner are, each in their own way, beautiful to behold, and perform well in their archetypal roles.

I generally like Ben Affleck as an actor, but wasn't sure how he would be as Daredevil, but after seeing the movie I wouldn't want to see anyone else play the part. The best was Colin Farrell as Bullseye... he really added the finishing touches to this film. As for Jennifer Garner, totally hot and kicking ass, as per usual... although I have to add that Elektra is no Sidney Bristow.At a certain point in the movie, it seemed like the movie was starting to climax and I was thinking, ""What's going on?""

First of all let me start of with saying that this movie is not ""wam bam"" special effects. It is a very human super-hero movie. They show you, he is a very real person and is not perfect. The love story sub-plot that is shown is done very tastefully and feels very real. You also understand, after seeing this, why they decided to release it on Valentines Day. The casting I was little skeptical on but they did a great job. Ben Affleck makes a good super-hero and Jennifer Garner does an even better job at playing the incredibly alluring Elektra. Make your own judgement but if you like super-hero movies with a very human edge that lets you relate to the characters go see this. It's not Spiderman, it's a completely different movie in film and style. More grittier and darker but overall still good.****/***** (4 out of 5)",Daredevil

When I saw this film the other day, I had been fairly familiar with the original comic, I knew enough to know that the Kingpin wasn't black in it, but Duncan did a good job portraying the massive crimelord. Some may feel that this film falls short of Xmen and spiderman, but I enjoyed it just as much as the other two. I liked all the characters in it, especially Jennifer Garner. I was a little disappointed with the ending, but it is very likely there will be a sequel to this one, just like all the others.

The action sequences are top notch, and possess the acrobatic impossibilities that allow this genre to flourish. The rollicking sinister nature of Bullseye establishes him as the preeminent comic bok baddie. The reality of the painkiller popping Matt Murdock, brings a degree of believability to a genre which doesn't need it, but is bettered by it. The film is too short, it is too compact, and while it is appreciated that the scope is not too grandiose, it could have stood another 20 minutes or so. If there is one drawback it is that the supporting cast is TOO good. We want more of Jon Favrau, more Joe Pantaliono, more Jennifer Garner, and a hell of a lot more Collin Farrell.  Daredevil, like Spiderman before it, is a successful and enjoyable first entry in a franchise with much promise. With the trailer for X-Men 2 attatched it is easy to see how superior comic sequels CAN be if handled right. Score another success for the geeks of the world.",Daredevil

True, there is a lack of the real storyline to the comic book, but then again, the movie's only a little over one and a half hours.  They make the story where the Daredevil is the main character, which it should be, but fails to support the other three characters, Elektra, Bullseye, and the Kingpin. Having no background of these characters only leads the viewers to questions such as, ""How did Bullseye get so good at aiming?""  The action scenes also suffer due to the length of the fights.  They're pretty much straight to the point and aren't elaborated whatsoever.  There are good things about the film that most people will not appreciate.  Unlike the comic book movies such as Spiderman and X-men, Daredevil has a dark atmosphere about it that's reminiscent of Batman and Batman Returns, drawing the viewer's attention. Another positive note is how the creators utilized the soundtrack into key scenes in the movie.  There's also humorous content that's better than most films like Daredevil.  Whether you have or haven't read the comic, the movie is good overall.  I enjoyed it.",Daredevil

Ben Affleck was better than expected.  His portrayal of DD was honest and at times gritty, and I really feel like he gave the character some justice. Jennifer Garner is gorgeous!  What a remarkable hottie.  I also thought Bullseye (Colin Farrell) was a scene stealer.My problem with the film was that it seemed like the writers of this script tried to fit 40 years of comic book character development into a 90 minute film.  The whole thing seemed rushed.  Knowing the comic book helped, but I can imagine if I was someone who was unfamiliar with the Daredevil story, I think at times I'd be scratching my head.The movie does a great job giving depth the main character (Daredevil),and that's about it. Without much explanation or warning, the other characters are thrown into the film, and regardless of their dynamic involvements, come off a bit mysterious.""Spiderman"", in comparison, didn't overwhelm audiences in the sense that there was great character development for not only Spidey, but Mary Jane, the Green Goblin, as well as Harry Osbourne and Aunt May.
Elektra manages to walk into a restaurant, perk Matt Murdock's interest, get into a ""break dance"" fight, ends up wet ""so I can see you"" on a roof top, and then gets naked (not that this reviewer is complaining) in what seems like 5 minutes.  This and similar ""fast food"" versions of the Kingpen and Bullseye characters left me a little disappointed.Not so disappointed to not want to buy the DVD when it comes out.
I also thought that Jon Favreau did a great job of adding some comedy relief to a movie that certainly showed it's dark side.So in conclusion, ""Daredevil"" was not as good as ""Spiderman"" or the original ""Batman"" ('89), but was on par with ""X-Men"" and ""Blade"".An altogether solid entry into the comic book genre of movies! 7 out of 10",Daredevil

I liked this adaptation, and whilst missing a solid exposition for many of the leading characters backgrounds, it is nether-the-less a hugely enjoyable romp. Particular gems are the scenes between Matt Murdock (Affleck) and Foggy Nelson (Favreau) his long suffering legal partner and any screen time with Elektra (Garner).

By trusting their properties in the hands of filmmakers who care, Marvel made it possible to capture all their legendary, iconic characters on screen. Daredevil is the newest entry.  Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson's love for the character and the lore is easily evident as he and Co. adapt one of the most important stories in the Marvel Universe.  Credit should be given to Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell, and John Favreau.  Ben Affleck - who is a huge Daredevil comic fan - completely nails the role of Matt Murdock/Daredevil, Jennifer Garner is a great female action heroine whose Elektra is truly electrifying.  To call Colin Farrell's performance over the top is a major understatement.  Farrell chews up the scenery and plays the psychotic super-assassin perfectly.  John Favreau is funny and earnest as Murdock's best friend and Law partner.Can't wait until the sequels to see other classic storylines such as Guardian Devil and Born Again adapted.

The same speaking throughout the film, parent/relative death/trama, and girl. I find it fascinating that these actors actually agreed to make this film, unworthy of being in the same theater as Lord of the Rings, Chicago, Adaptation, and The Hours. Many of the cast members have shown decent to exceptional acting, such as Michael Clarke Duncan who gave a great performance in The Green Mile, Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting, and Jennifer Garner in Alias. It's sickening that they would agree to make this only because of the paycheck. Do actors even care about quality films anymore? Not only is the story line slow and manipulative, the computer generated graphics are horrible. During the climax, a fight between Daredevil and Bulleye in a CHURCH on an ORGAN (lame location), the images before you are appear so fake, as if they jumped from a video game. The movie left me perplexed about the smallest unrealistic things, such as if he owns a small unsuccessful law firm, he's blind, and he keeps his identity unreveled, where did all his custom outfits and gadets come from? And is if he kills people who've been claimed innocent by the court why does he kill them? That's not what a ""hero"" would do, more like a murderer. I would not reccomend anyone see this film.

750,The_Kevin,Well it isn't Shakespeare...,6,17 February 2003,"But then again one does not go see a movie like Daredevil expecting Shakespeare.Daredevil, for all it's problems (and it does have a more than a few) is what it is, nothing more (certainly) and nothing less.While I will leave the honest to goodness critique's of this film to those that get paid to write them, I will say one or two things about it.Number 1: Daredevil is what comic book fans call something of a supporting character, even though he has his own title. He never has been seen as one of the major stars of the Marvel line, the renaissance he had under Frank Miller's direction notwithstanding, he has never been as popular as say Spider-Man or the X-Men. So I was a little surprised when it was announced that a Daredevil movie was in the works. I was also surprised when it was announced who was going to play the part of the title character. Now, no, I am not a huge fan of Ben Affleck's, I don't dislike him nor do I consider myself a fan of his, Affleck is, like this film, nothing more than what he is and nothing less, a somewhat talented, good-looking individual, who does what he can with what he has. Having said that, I really honestly can not think of anyone else who could have played the part (Thomas Jane maybe and that's a weak maybe) for when you have material such as this you do not need (or want for that matter) someone whose acting chops is going to overshadow the material, and with Affleck one doesn't have to worry about that happening.Number 2: One of this film's glaring problems (at least in my view) was it's explanation of just how Daredevil became a master of martial-arts. In the comic Matt Murdock is tutored by the enigmatic Stick in the ways of the warrior, in the movie Daredevil's fighting abilities are seen as an extension of the accident that heightened his senses, due to the fact (and this is an almost direct quote from the movie) his heightened sense of touch now provided him an excellent sense of balance. I dislike revisionism, be it with real-life historical events, or in the fantasy world of comic books. Granted keeping with the history of the character as outlined in the comic book would have cut into the films running time (and it isn't that long), but they really didn't have to take the easy way out like they did, simply having Stick show up during the turning point in Matt's life and then fast-forwarding to a grown-up Matt Murdock/Daredevil, would have set better with me, than what they actually did.Despite the one problem I outlined above (there are more than just that one), I did enjoy Daredevil for the kind of movie it was. No it won't win any Oscars, but then I do not go see movies like Daredevil for that, I see movies like Saving Private Ryan.",Daredevil

As a long time Marvel reader, I have fears about every comic based movie and have seen titles brought to the screen with varying degrees of sucess, from bad (ie The Punisher) to not bad (X-Men).The advantage that Daredevil has over X-Men is that there is one central character, as opposed to dozens, which make the central storyline more compact and easier to take.  Although the storyline of the comic has been changed, the basic line of it remains (Matt Murdock is blinded, his other senses become hyper acute, his father is killed, he becomes a lawyer by day and a vigilante for justice at night), which is important to the character.I thought Ben Affleck made a good Daredevil, though by the end of the movie he was dependent on his frat boy smirk more and more.  Jennifer Garner made a good start as Elektra Natchios, but I felt the character was a little underdeveloped.  Michael Clarke Duncan made the most of his character and his limited screen time, and the fight scene between Kingpin and Daredevil was a joy to watch.  Colin Farrell nearly stole the show as the nasty Bullseye (and I for one was glad to see the comic's costume not appear here!)The fight scenes were well choreographed, but a little less of the slo-mo camera work would have been appreciated.  The wire work was great, I thought, especially the scene with Matt and Elektra in the playground. The cgi of how Matt ""sees"" was well done, and better than expected.All in all, expect some camp (there has to be in a comic based movie) but the reality of the characters and their dualities is well done.",Daredevil

754,bdemarti,Ben Affleck's painful-to-watch performance amid a poorly written script and dull special-effects.,1,5 March 2003,"Okay. Where does one begin with this one...Let's just say that by the end of the movie, the Daredevil character lacked character (and wasn't likeable, really), and I wanted my money back.I was restless in my seat for an hour and a half, hoping that Elecktra (played with too much restraint by the talented Jennifer Garner) or Bullseye (played by one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, Colin Farrell), would annihilate this lifeless, pathetic Daredevil (deemed a superhero either by the fictitious characters in the movie or by the Hollywood marketing gurus)--It's difficult to know, really.The story is so flawed and Ben Affleck so bland yet overwrought at times, that in the end you really don't care about him or the what happens next in the narrative. Why? Because the script lacks emotion, credibility, and character development, especially concerning Daredevil. What exactly makes Daredevil a superhero? Had Affeck researched the role a little, perhaps he might have been a believable do-gooder lawyer, Matt Murdock,  defending the helpless in Hell's Kitchen, while his remarkable OTHER senses guide him without harm to his desired destination. But instead we get a cocky blind man arrogantly tapping his special cane along route, while wearing an inexplicable smirk on his face. And when it's time for Matt Murdock to serve justice, we get Daredevil, the whining, victimized and defeated caped-crusader of sorts. I'd rather fight my own fight on the street and lose without the appearance of a sulking straggler in a red cape and fake muscles assuring my safety. Daredevil deserved to have his butt kicked. Where was the emotional conflict, the deprecating sense of humor that we find so compelling in Batman? Where was the dignity...Moreover, the dialogue was painful to hear. I will cut some slack for Affleck's poor performance because the script required the actors to spew such redolent, trite, and ridiculous expressions. But then there's Colin Farrell's performance. He was able to develop his character in less than a minute.  Perhaps Bill Everett and Brian Helgeland, the scriptwriters, felt more connected to Bullseye's character, hence, original dialogue somehow emerged. Nevertherless, Farrell made it work.Furthermore, I was disappointed that the special-effects did nothing to enhance the story. And when Affleck twirls into action, his motions are digitized to make him look as though he CAN fight...and we're talking basic street fighting, people...I didn't have much expectation going into this movie. But it was worse than I had imagined it would be. Please, don't make a sequel.",Daredevil

The changes that were made to adapt the story to film made good sense and were mild enough so as not to offend long -time fans. Colin Farrel's portrayal of Bullseye was perfect!

It is noticable that Daredevil had a smaller budget than the Hulk or Spiderman but it is in fact my favourite of the three.

What's the point of the playground/waste of time. Could've figured an easier way for them to meet. Should have been a deleted scene.2. More encounters b/w Kingpin and Daredevil. They only had one true encounter. (The Ball and The funeral didn't count because Kingpin didn't know who Daredevil was and Murdock didn't know who Kingpin was). Yea I know Kingpin was supposed to be secretive but they could've still met in other ways. Ex: The first fight scene or maybe even add another scene.3. Should have used Daredevil in the public more. Public didn't really know or talk about him at all until the very end conversation with Jon Favreau.This movie was a disappointment in Superhero movies.

781,redfox18,Could have been so much more,5,14 February 2006,"Ben Affleck I didn't like as DD. He's too bulky, DD is more lean and Spider-Man like. He also isn't that great of an actor. Overall he was OK, but at no point is he ever ""Matt Murdoch"", he's always ""Ben Affleck"". Also, there's just something about his face...The DD costume was also a little strange in how they separated the mask from the rest of the suit. It looked like a weird pirate cap or something on his head.Jennifer Garner's acting wasn't too good. She also doesn't look like how I would imagine a real life Elektra. She doesn't have the fair skin and jet black hair, and she just looks too ""nice"". The actress they chose should have looked similar to Catherine Zeta-Jones (NOT Catherine Zeta-Jones though, she's too old for the role now).Elektra was also the most horribly written character in this movie. Elektra IS NOT a hero, nor does she have any concern about killing someone (alteast the way she was when Matt first met her). They took an interesting character and destroyed her.Micheal Clark Duncan was fine as King Pin. His acting and physical frame made up for the difference in skin color. IMHO, King Pin is one of those characters that it doesn't really matter if they change his ethnicity; at the very least, it's not a big deal.Colin Farrel as Bullseye was great, he's the best part of the whole movie. The ""bullseye"" on forehead thing was a little strange, but overall the character design and the way he was written was perfect.As for the movie itself....The story was alright, but some scenes were retarded, such as Matt fighting Elektra in the park. Good way to hide your identity Matt! Fight in a public park in the middle of the day and do a bunch of martial arts and show how capable you really are. Yep, no one will suspect your DD now! ""Hey, do you think that guy in the park doing all the unbelievable flips and martial arts is DD?"" ""No way, he's blind!"". Ugh They entirely remove the transition between ""Matt as child"" and ""Matt as adult"". He just suddenly has all these costumes and what not. Stick not being in this movie doesn't ruin it, but it certainly wouldn't have hurt, and it would have explained a lot.Finally, the CGI in this movie looks awful, and a lot of the ""wire-fu"" is very obvious, such as characters that are supposed to be jumping appearing to be floating through the air and then landing with no weight.",Daredevil

It just screams...BAD and CHEESY and DISASTER.' I don't know how this movie got made.Okay, so the ideas behind the special effects were cool sometimes, but overall they were awful. Amateur, not remotely believable...if I dwell on it I'm going to barf.The acting wasn't too bad, surprisingly. Ben Affleck has talent, but he must've left most of it at home. He played the role perfectly. Which is not a complement, seeing as the character was way too underdeveloped, even with a 15 minute flashback of his youth. Come to think of it, the kid who played young Matt Murdock was the highlight of the movie. He really did it well. I love Jennifer Garner as a person, I really do. She's a sweet young lady, but her acting skills aren't too great. She pulled off Elektra, but that's not a great feat. Colin Farrell was also a highlight for the first half, I liked his character, even if it was the bad guy. He was intriguing. But at the end the intrigue of a villain fell away and he was just the bad guy. It was nice to see him in a different type of character, seeing as most of the time his looks are all he's got going for him. With his hair gone in this movie(I won't scar the word 'film' by calling it one) his acting skills were all he had, and it was okay. Joe Pantolino was of course good, even though his character, while not as badly written as the other, was badly written. I just want to know why he would deign to perform in such an awful movie.But the story is really what made this movie so...bad. there's just no way around it. They forgot character development, development of the romance, and in the beginning of the movie, I wasn't sure who the villain was- the rapist or Daredevil. He wasn't a superhero, he was a murderer. Tsk tsk. Murder is a worse crime than rape, stupid! And of course, he learns his lesson and doesn't kill the one person he could have a reason to kill, but doesn't care about the others with smaller crimes who he killed. Everything in the movie, even the twists, were expected. And bad.

Ben played the role perfectly, even if the original wasn't that dark, he convinced the audience he truly was dark inside, and that there was more to him than just a stereotypical ""good guy"". One could tell he stayed true to the comic book character, as did the rest of the cast. Daredevil was simply great in the movie (directors cut better of course)and most of which was because of Affleck. Not many others could have pulled it off, and with the great cast of Jennifer Garner and Michael Clarke...damn...near perfect casting there. Jennifer Garner also kicked some major booty, even though I was expecting her as Karen Paige, but with that there would have been no way it could have been rated pg-13. Elektra did surprise me though, and in a very good way i'd like to add.

I like the fact that Daredevil/Matt was at a crossroads in his life, that he didn't know anymore if he was ""the bad guy"" or not.

I got the Directer's Cut for Christmas and OH MY GOD it made this movie so much better. The subplot with Coolio really rounds out the character's of Matt and Foggy and little scenes added back in here and there like Matt's rituals after patrol and in the morning, and the extended version of him and Elektra on the roof before the rain made part of the ending make more sense. One thing I really enjoyed was the additional time to developing the Kingpin and making him really seem like a bad guy helped a lot. All in all whoever made the call to cut all this stuff from the movie should be fired from the studio because the theatrical release was a butchery and a farce.

But come on Colin Farrel was horrible as bullseye. The sole saving grace was Michael Clark Duncan as the Kingpin. Someone please put an honest review up as the first review. The way daredevil's ""hearing-sight"" was shown was literally unbelievable. 3-d sonar? And the scene with Elektra in the rain? How does he see features that are under her facial features? It would all be black. For that matter, the rain hitting him would overpower most other sounds. Why do you think one of the choices for white-noise generators is rainfall? You do know rainfall deadens sonar effectiveness, right? Try this. Snap your fingers in the shower. Now turn it on, and snap your fingers again. To conclude, this was a horrible adaptation of the comics. Shame on you all.",Daredevil
789,Bob_Cat,A respectable film but over worked on the CGI,7,30 August 2006,"I saw DD when it was first released and now I have just bought the Director's Cut DVD because it complimented my copy of Elektra. It is a good film now, well composed and having all the right elements. The plot was explained indulgently in detail such as perhaps the first piece in the church was excessive but overall it had a much more solid plot.All the characters were well formed and well played, each delivering the performances we can expect from such a top class cast. Even down to Karen the legal assistant and Nikolas the father.What disappointed me was the over played CGI, some of the sequences were plainly over done. I am sorry guys, I know you are good, but I can spot that much compositing a mile off, so please don't spoil it for us professional by over doing it when you get given new toys. There were too many jump/fall sequences with painted backdrops and too many CGI skylines. The switch between virtual and real characters was not as oblivious as it should be to carry off such sequences.Bob",Daredevil
790,maxbin,High above my expectations!,9,15 June 2005,"I've heard of that movie from several sources, but the gender (comics) and the overall grade of 5.7 (at a time) have slightly discouraged me to watch this, but I thought, I will take a peek and if this is a crap I won't look any further. I've read some comment that Director's Cut is nicer, thus I watched DC version. From the very beginning the plot doesn't start as a typical action/comics/adventure movie. As a whole I find the screenplay/plot interesting and quite curiosity arising. Expecting for a dull action movie I got very well played interesting and emotional movie which was worth every minute of watching it. Of course some scenes seem a little bit childish and superficial but if you Emit this scenes and do not pay attention to them, you get a nice watch.",Daredevil
791,baller007_123,Too much CG!,5,22 March 2005,"I can't say that I enjoyed this movie too much. It had some corny lines and was definitely 'watered down' for the PG-13 rating (although we still got some pretty graphic scenes like the dagger through the hand and the dual knee breakage).The thing that bugged me the most though was the total 'we have a big budget lets use computer graphics for everything' idea. Sure it's a comic book adaptation but the action scenes need to be 'somewhat' believable. Some scenes I could barely tell what thee heck was going on because of daredevil's ridiculous body movements and all the CG crap flying everywhere. He has enhanced senses! He's not in the matrix!The CG for his senses was done nicely I have to admit, but they needed to tone down the rest.Did this bug anyone else about the movie?",Daredevil
792,rodrigovalimjr2011,Ótimo,10,11 February 2015,"-A good movie from beginning to end, with many voltage action scenes, made by good actors. one of the best hero of films that have already launched, pity that no managed to continue the franchise. -but even they have not invested much in Daredevil, this movie will never be forgotten by fans. -I hope that the show will launch the Daredevil is good equal was that movie. I do not understand how this movie has not done much success, had made perhaps the producers continued to saga.I recommend -this movie for people who like action movies and Marvel movies.-one excellent movie, in my opinion note 10.",Daredevil
793,svase,hilarious - the bad way,2,17 July 2005,"I know this is a late comment for an already old movie, but I just saw the movie again, and it refreshed some old memories. There are three reasons why the movie received an extra star from me: 1) Bullseye. I like his tattoo and his little ""Hey Orphan, let's play!"" and ""You're good, baby, I'll give you that. But me? I'm magic!""-quotes make me laugh. I may have a weakness for the Irish language. 2) Jennifer Garner. She wouldn't have to run around my bed for a long time, as we say in Denmark. 3) The little cigarette-trick from that journalist when he lites the DD written in fuel. Apart from this, DD is nothing more than a parody of I-don't-even-know-what. The action scenes could have saved some dignity for the movie, if they made sense. Bad news: they don't. And even worse, they kill whatever plot that was meant to be in the movie. But I don't say ""don't watch this"" - I really think you should. But don't expect anything but a parody and a couple of memorable quotes.",Daredevil
794,flowers2000,Director's Cut much better!,8,7 December 2005,"I also saw the theatrical release and didn't think much of it. I found it was a bit confusing at some points. It was okay, but I recently bought the Director's Cut and was amazed at the improved story. In this version, the deleted scenes that were cut in order to make the movie around the 100 minute mark were added back in. They definitely should have left them in. Why they didn't play this version in the cinemas baffles me! The deleted scenes in this version added so much more depth and understanding to the overall story line. I also recommend watching the commentary on the movie (which can be turned 'on' by going into the main menu). It would be great to see a sequel involving Elektra even though she has her own movie now. Overall, it's a great movie if you are a big fan of comic heroes.",Daredevil
795,emiliastefanova777,The best,10,12 February 2006,"This is the greatest movie on earth!!!-the best actors- Ben Afleck and Jennifer Garner playing in one movie-that's SO COOL!!!

796,Kovacs86,"Daredevil: The most underrated movie ever, this did NOT suck!",7,22 April 2006,"OK, first, I loved this movie. I thought Ben Affleck was pretty good and, well, Michael Clark Duncan as the Kingpin was excellent! The only thing that annoyed me was the irritating display of Colin Farell as Bullseye and he wasn't bad. I believe that, though this movie was criticised for DD killing the rapist (and possibly killing Bullseye, I'm not sure!), it added a great new twist to the tale: Daredevil realising that there is a difference between vengeance and justice and that truly he wanted justice, as shown in the very good conclusive battle between DD and Kingpin where he spares Fisk's life. Another criticism was that Kingpin was black... I loved that change and thought it IMPROVED the character, and that MCD was outstanding... the only but I thought was slightly rushed was in fact the rooftop fight scene which lead to (SPOILER!) the death of Elektra, though I believe the Director's Cut improves on that... the theatrical release was forced to be cut heavily so that it would be a PG13 rather than 15, even thought it was a 15 in the UK anyway! Really, if you want to watch this, don't watch the excellent theatrical release, watch the outstanding Director's Cut (ln Amazon UK, it's £3 cheaper WITh the poor Elektra than without!!!!)Really, ignore the unjust criticisms... and watch it!!!",Daredevil
797,jkyt07,Bullseye is the only good part of this movie,2,27 October 2019,"It is especially apparent in the beginning of the movie, and improves as it goes on, but nearly every aspect of the movie is noticably sub-par. The acting (especially young Matt who was bad even for a child actor), the camera work, the writing, the dialogue fluctuated between good and bad, and quite often I was feeling as though the musical choices did not fit the tone of the scene at all. Killing Elektra I thought was a nice subversive move that I liked and hoped that they did not bring her back, only to be dissapointed. Bullseye's character was the best out of all of them and while they could have toned the crazy down a little bit I wish that he had more development in the movie rather than the higher focus on Kingpin. Furthermore, every person in this movie who had a gun has worse aim than stormtroopers.",Daredevil
798,manboi,Way Better than Most Critics Will Give it Credit For,10,2 July 2006,"I think the reason this movie got slammed so much was because of Ben Affleck. He did the movie right after the whole Gigli box office mushroom cloud and his popularity was on a major downslide as well. The truth is he did an outstanding job in this film and his performance is noteworthy. Jennifer Gardner as Electra always kicks ass. Colin Farrell was one bad baddie but so fun to watch. All in all this movie was in my opinion faithful to the comic and a respectable big screen adaptation. It was certainly far superior to let's say The Fantastic Four. Back to Affleck again, he really was getting sour grapes and a bumb deal on the whole thing. Also the director's cut is even better so for all of you naysayers, watch it and give the film a second chance. You'd be pleasantly surprised and maybe not so hard on poor Ben.",Daredevil
799,henrycraven-72362,Watch the Director's Cut,7,6 February 2019,"I have also suffered through the theatrical cut when I was bored, at a time when supposedly much ""better"" superhero films like the avengers had recently come out and were ridiculously popular with my peers. From that viewing, the most memorable part of the film was Colin Farrell's portrayal of a monosyllabic Irish caveman.However, the director's cut is much darker and far more enjoyable and substantially fleshs out what were mostly not my favourite action scenes (apart from the amusing pub scene with the aforementioned rogue darts player). If you're a fan of the comic (or even superhero films in general), then I would advise you to give it a watch.",Daredevil
