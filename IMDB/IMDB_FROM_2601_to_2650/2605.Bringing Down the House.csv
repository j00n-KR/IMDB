0,TheLittleSongbird,"I do like Steve Martin, but this film was awful",2,4 October 2010,"That is not to say all of Steve Martin's films are terrible, Planes, Trains and Automobiles, The Jerk, Man with Two Brains and Roxanne were gems, Father of the Bride is better than it is given credit for and the Cheaper By the Dozen movies while deeply flawed were watchable. But for several reasons, Bringing Down the House was just awful. Steve Martin isn't necessarily bad in it, he does try hard, as does Queen Latifah, but their chemistry is badly forced and they are further hampered by an awful script and a predictable story. Eugene Levy is usually excellent but he is wasted here, and the direction is lacklustre too. The film looks okay, with some nice cinematography and scenery, and the soundtrack has its moments that I accept, but the above points and the stereotypes and unintentional yet apparent racism and homophobia really spoil what could have been a decent comedy making it almost unwatchable. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Bringing Down the House
1,SnoopyStyle,Almost funny in dated comedy,5,30 November 2014,"Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) is a straight forward tax attorney who still loves his ex-wife Kate (Jean Smart) even though she has a new boytoy in her life. He disappoints his kids once again while courting heiress Virginia Arness (Joan Plowright) as a client. He has an on-line friendship with LawyerGirl but her photo is misleading. Instead of a slim blonde lawyer, she's actually prison escapee Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) who insists on her innocence. She hounds him until he's willing to help her clear her name. His work friend Howie Rottman (Eugene Levy) helps out and he is infatuated with the streetwise Charlene. Kate's sister Ashley (Missi Pyle) and Peter's neighbor Mrs. Kline (Betty White) suspect something's wrong with the supposed nanny.This is a workable concept of an uptight white guy trying to deal with a black urban woman. It's a broad odd-couple PG-comedy from the 80s. It's not inappropriate enough to be funny. It's not sharp enough to be edgy. It doesn't handle race with enough deft. Steve Martin is playing this slightly dated. The whole thing feels dated. I like Queen Latifah's earthiness. Their chemistry is almost there. This is a small miss. At least, Eugene Levy gets a few inappropriate laughs and Missi Pyle gets into a ridiculous fight with the Queen.",Bringing Down the House
2,claudio_carvalho,A Funny Comedy With Many Good Moments,7,21 September 2004,"Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) is a divorced workaholic lawyer, who spends his time working and in a chat room for lawyers in Internet, where he meets the young lawyer Charlene Morton. He has a teenager daughter and a son, and misses his wife Kate (Jean Smart). One day, he schedules a dinner at his home with the pretty and blonde Charlene, of whom he has a picture only. When he opens his door, he sees that Charlene is indeed a huge Afro-American woman (Queen Latifah), who was in jail and wants him to defend her, claiming that she is innocent. Charlene forces Peter to lodge and defend her, and from this moment on, his life turns upside-down. This movie is a very funny comedy, with many good moments. For example, when his teenager daughter trusts on him and decides to tell him other hidden stories about her, it is hilarious. Or when Peter opens the door and sees Charlene for the first time. There are many other funny scenes. Of course there are also many clichés, this film is not a surrealistic art movie and certainly will not be indicated for an Oscar. But I laughed a lot with the situations created by Steve Martin, Queen Latifah, Eugene Levy and Joan Plowright. Highly recommended for laughing. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'A Casa Caiu' ('The House is Down')",Bringing Down the House
3,lee_eisenberg,"Really something, Boo.",6,18 March 2006,"OK, so the white-yuppie-and-black-ghetto-person-joining-up idea has been used a number of times in movies, but the dialog between Steve Martin and Queen Latifah makes this one worthwhile. Probably the best scenes are Betty White's nasty comments, Queen Latifah teaching Missi Pyle a lesson, Steve Martin dressed - and attempting to talk - like a rapper (especially because of what Joan Plowright ends up doing in that scene), and of course, Eugene Levy's statements ending with ""Boo"". ""Bringing Down the House"" really does bring down the house. Completely silly, but fun nevertheless.Who ever would have imagined Joan Plowright (aka Laurence Olivier's widow) doing what she did and saying what she said in the rapper scene?",Bringing Down the House
4,jboothmillard,Bringing Down the House,2,21 February 2009,"I saw the trailer for this film, it looked amusing at points, and then I read it was one out of five stars, but I tried it anyway, from director Adam Shankman (The Wedding Planner, Cheaper by the Dozen 2). Basically Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) is a divorced attorney who can't understand why his ex-wife Kate (Jean Smart), who he still loves, left him. He is trying to move on, and has met a girl on an internet chat-room, known only as ""Lawyer Girl"", and he has suggested they meet at his house, but of course, a completely different person show up at his doorstep. It is African American ghetto girl Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah), in the background of the photo he received, she is a prison escapee who wants to prove she wasn't involved with a robbery. It takes a while for Peter to agree to help her, as she is turning his life upside down, stopping him from trying to get back with Kate, and wooing billion dollar client, Virginia Arness (Joan Plowright). There is the obvious small sentiment, and the moment Peter can't take anymore, but he realises her innocence when an African American criminal threatens him with a gun. So he dresses to get into the hood, to get to this criminal and get a confession that he set Charlene up, and, it works. Oh, it should be mentioned, Peter's work buddy Howie Rottman (Eugene Levy) becomes infatuated by Charlene, and vice versa. Also starring Kimberly J. Brown as Sarah Sanderson, Angus T. Jones as Georgey Sanderson, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Missi Pyle as Ashley, Michael Rosenbaum as Todd Gendler, Betty White as Mrs. Kline and Steve Harris as Widow. I guess I giggled a little when Martin's tummy rumbles from taking laxative or whatever, and dressed for the hood, but I can see why the critics give it the amount of stars it has. It's filled with stereotypes, it doesn't have any decent comedy (well, no comedy period), and indeed Martin and Latifah are pretty forced together, it's just a bit boring. Pretty poor!",Bringing Down the House
5,edwagreen,Hilarious-Wonderful Comedy ****,10,12 May 2012,"This excellent comedy with a wonderful story has phenomenal chemistry between its stars- Steve Martin and Queen Latifah.Latifah, a prison inmate, fools Martin, an established attorney while on the internet. She breaks out of jail and into his life while pleading with him to help prove her innocence in a robbery.The film has all the ingredients for success. Joan Plowright steals the show as an elderly wealthy dowager whose finances the firm wants to handle. How she is drawn into the situation with Martin and Latfiah is a comedy in itself.Betty White, as a nosy neighbor, adds sparkle to this comedy with fabulous dialogue. Martin shakes out of his middle class values and delivers comic classics in dance routines with Miss Latifah.Yes, there are racial over-tones but they are handled in an appropriate manner. Let's face it-such discrimination, though wrong, exists at country clubs.",Bringing Down the House
6,jotix100,Beware of who you meet in the chat room.,8,20 March 2003,"This film, although badly reviewed by many people, proves to be a fun time at the movies. Adam Shankman and Jason Filardi have teamed up to give the viewers lots of laughs. It's hard not to be amused by what's being presented even though it might not be the greatest, or the funniest picture.
Queen Latifah has more charisma in her ample body than any other actress working in American films these days. She never gives a bad performance. This is quite a stretch from her role in Chicago; in fact, she steals the film with her charm. She can hold up her own against her co-star.
Steve Martin seems to blend himself into this joke of a lawyer, who is so uptight and anal that he never has enough time for his children. He has some hysterical scenes at the hip hop club playing an Eminem-type character, outdancing everyone. Mr. Martin's experience in the chat room brings him a lot more than he bargained for: the irrisistible Charlene, who turns his life upside down.Eugene Levy has some bright moments as Steve Martin's friend in the firm. Joan Plowright repeats herself into the role of the ogre with a heart of gold, once she loosens up with the right kind of smoke. The rest of the cast is good, working with the material they're given to perform.
If you are trying to get away from the horrible news being bombarded at us these days, this is the film for you.",Bringing Down the House
7,anaconda-40658,Bringing Down Steve Martin's Career.,2,21 May 2015,"Bringing Down the House (2003): Dir: Adam Shankman / Cast: Steve Martin, Queen Latifah, Joan Plowright, Eugene Levy, Jean Smart: Deadpan comedy dread about change in both lifestyles and attitudes. Steve Martin plays a lawyer recently separated from his wife so he subdues himself to e-mail chat rooms. He plans a date only to discover that his blonde beauty is really a black felon played by Queen Latifah. She wants Martin to reopen her case involving four years in prison for a crime she did not commit. Routine setup follows formula until it evaporates into a standard climax. Directed by Adam Shankman who previously made A Walk to Remember and the pathetic chick flick The Wedding Planner. This doesn't improve his choice in films despite the talent who chose to waste their time on it. Latifah is a fine actress but she has potential that goes way beyond the routine formula driven predictable drivel she is given here. Martin plays his regular comic routine that worked much better in other films such as Bowfinger and The Jerk. Joan Plowright plays a wealthy client that turns out to be more a plot prop than anything else. Eugene Levy recites his American Pie role only to a much lesser degree. Jean Smart plays Martin's ex-wife and that is about the extent of her role. Routine Martin comedy so pathetically bland that it brings down more than the house. Score: 2 / 10",Bringing Down the House
8,HotToastyRag,Not politically correct,4,27 August 2019,"I don't really know what's worse: the premise or the theme of the humor in Bringing Down the House. The premise is a divorced lawyer starts dating again and sets up a blind date with an internet flirtation. When the woman shows up and he's not physically attracted to her, she then helps him loosen up with the goal of winning back his wife. If he wanted his wife back, why was he starting to date again? Why did he set up a romantic liaison at his apartment complete with champagne and a pretty obvious intention that, had he found her attractive, he'd want to end their date in the bedroom?The theme of the humor is, in essence, racism. Steve Martin is the divorced lawyer, and Queen Latifah shows up at his door. I love Queen Latifah! Why would he immediately be disappointed when she showed up on his doorstep with a sparkling smile and a bubbling attitude? Steve finds out Queenie is an ex-con, and while explaining her case, she speaks in Ebonics and Steve doesn't even understand what she's talking about. She's a free spirit and as she helps him loosen up, he ends up dressing like a ""gangsta"" and using bad grammar. Steve's pal, Eugene Levy, serves as the comic relief who believes in colorblind love. He wants to strike up a romance with Queenie, and to show he's hip enough to pursue her, he also speaks in Ebonics.If you love Queenie, like I do, you'll want to watch all her movies, right? You'll get some laughs out of this one, but it's not the most politically correct comedy out there. My favorite is Beauty Shop, so you might want to have that one on hand afterwards.",Bringing Down the House
9,FlashCallahan,What's a rack? A country......,7,4 April 2017,"Peter Sanderson is a divorced attorney who still loves his ex-wife and can't figure out what he did wrong to make her leave. Peter's trying to move on, and he's smitten with barrister he's been chatting to online. When she comes to his house for their first date, she isn't a lawyer. Instead, it's Charlene, a prison escapee who's proclaiming her innocence and wants Peter to help her clear her name. But Peter wants nothing to do with her, prompting Charlene to turn Peter's perfectly ordered life upside down, jeopardising his efforts to get back with his wife and win a very prolific client.....What could have been just another formulaic comedy about two people who couldn't be more opposite if they tried, is lifted from the mundane thanks to the wonderful performances from Martin, Latifah, and a scene stealing Levy, as the straight laced jive talking wannabe boyfriend.Martin has done this role a dozen times before, and here, he goes for the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it approach', and for a film like this, it's perfectly fine.It's always fun to see the atypical middle class American man become an almost nervous wreck because someone has disrupted his perfect life.And here, Latifah is that someone, and instead of making her the stereotypical loud mouth from the 'hood', the writers have rightfully made her character three dimensional, and very likable to boot.The comedy here sometimes verges on the offensive, for example, Betty Whites character is totally unnecessary as the casual racist, but obviously, the writers wanted her to be more of an ignoramus, rather than how she is depicted, and it just doesn't sit well.Plowright pops up as the potential client, and again, although she is very good, the scene when they are having dinner, stinks of casual racism.I know it's not the writers intentions to make this film quite uncomfortable at times, but the film can laugh at itself on occasion, and the chemistry between the two leads is wonderful.If your a Martin fan, this is a must, he recaptures the magic he had in the eighties, and this could be the last good thing he ever did.",Bringing Down the House
10,zetes,Painfully lame comedy,3,9 August 2003,"Man, who allows scripts like this to be made into movies? Is it really that funny to hear a Jewish guy speak in black slang and an old white guy pretend he's African American? Why didn't they just put Steve Martin in blackface? This film is far more offensive than Al Jolson singing `Mammy,' let me tell you. I feel so embarrassed for Martin. He's far too talented to be appearing in sh*t like this. Queen Latifah provides some of the energy that should have been in the script, but she doesn't have the talent to save this train wreck. This film was very successful, but I beg you, Hollywood, please don't shove a sequel down our throats. You can't blame the executives, however. The audience is directly culpable for dreck like this, and every single person who gave this film a dime should feel ashamed. 3/10.",Bringing Down the House
11,elo-equipamentos,Weak clash of cultures comedy of just one tune!!!,5,24 November 2020,"I did take the plunge in this weak comedy already knowing that it didn't work out properly, bingo!! The humor displayed by Latifah has just one tune, in other hand Steve Martin seems outdate just making odd grimaces, actually his time is over, somebody needs to tell him, before it is too late, the plot is absolutely far-fetched and off-color, Queem Latifah also is the executive producer which imposes her unique character, a black woman with loutish black jargon and unimaginative also recurrent, although has some moments to smile with restraint, still Eugene Levy worthwhile be noted, a sort of freak man gawking at black hot girl, all remainder is formulaic as Hollywood always does, empathetic ensemble of two antagonistic ethnicities which has a slight racism enclosed by white people, mainly the older ones, without sexual appeal the presentation stays lame and unfeasible, puerile and predicable!!Thanks for reading.Resume:First watch: 2020 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 5.5",Bringing Down the House
12,namashi_1,Steve Martin Shines in this Fun Comedy!,7,10 March 2016,"Lets get one thing straight right away: Steve Martin can never be doubted. The Comedic Legend is an actor with tremendous charm & his sense of timing is no news to anyone. And in the 2003 Super-Hit 'Bringing Down The House', the Legend shines, yet again!'Bringing Down The House' Synopsis: When a lonely guy meets a woman on the internet who happens to be in prison, she breaks out to be with him, and proceeds to wreak havoc on his middle-class life.'Bringing Down The House' is a predictable, safe comedy, that goes through the narrative jumps & hiccups. Its mostly Martin's liveliness & command over the screen, that keeps the jokes coming in & the energy intact. Jason Filardi's Screenplay is nicely done, although it would've benefited from better jokes. Adam Shankman's Direction is appropriate. A Special Mention for Queen Latifah, who with Martin, takes part in the silly jokes & delivers a loud, but likable performance. And the on-screen chemistry between Martin & Latifah, is perfect.On the whole, 'Bringing Down The House' certainly works.",Bringing Down the House
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,The Best Cat Fight Scene Since Kill Bill!,9,10 October 2006,"My mom has been begging for me to watch Bringing Down the House, especially since I've been getting more into Steve Martin. He brought me nothing but laughter with Bowfinger, Little Shop of Horrors, and now Bringing Down the House. He and Queen Latifa make such a great comedic duo, this movie was in no way over the top or stereotypical, at least of the sense where I think you couldn't find it offensive. For those who did find it offensive, I think you probably watched this movie in a serious mood, because how could you not laugh? Steve Martin plays Peter Sanderson, a straight up-tight business man who won't get his priorities right with his family and work, he expects to meet a beautiful, intelligent, and blond white lawyer he met off the internet, but instead gets Charlene, a tough soul sister who has just escaped prison and wants Peter to get her name cleared. She claims she is innocent and she won't leave Peter alone until he helps out, through the madness of trying to play Peter off as a business man and trying to get his family back, Charlene teaches him a thing or two along with him teaching her as well.There are just some hilarious scenes, my favorite I think was the cat fight scene between Charlene and Peter's ex sister in-law. That was just hilarious! I also loved Steve getting accepted at a hard core gangsta's club and the last scene of Charlene and her new boyfriend, Howie. Steve and Queen were so cool together and I would highly recommend this film! 9/10",Bringing Down the House
14,=G=,A'ight!,7,7 August 2003,"If the idea of one of the ""whitest"" comedians in Hollywood (Martin) teaming up with one of the ""blackest"" divas (Latifah) appeals to you, then you might enjoy ""Bringing Down the House"". The film has Martin as a divorced tax attorney while Latifah plays a jailbird on the run who needs an attorney to prove her innocence and gives Martin plenty of ""tude"" along with some lessons in getting real as they raucously wend their way through countless comedic contrivances. Personally I enjoyed this busy top-of-the-marquee comedy romp a lot. However, it requires being able to find humor in the juxtaposition of Martin and Latifah which, judging from comments elsewhere on this website, not everyone did. (B)",Bringing Down the House
15,disdressed12,not what i was expecting,3,13 March 2007,"for me,this movie was very disappointing.for 1 thing,(spoiler ahead)it is marketed as a comedy,yet,in my opinion it is a drama/action movie.there are a few mildly funny scenes,and maybe 1 or 2 very funny scenes.otherwise,this isn't a funny movie.the the subject matter is fairly dark,also.especially the dramatic scenes.there is a bit of action thrown in.however,if you are expecting a drop dead funny comedy,and instead end up watching a fairly dark drama,you might be disappointed.i wish studios would stop what almost amounts to false advertising,but that's how they hook people.if i remember correctly,almost all the funny bits were in the trailer.but everybody has different tastes,so some people may find the movie hysterical.anyway,that's just my opinion.i'd have to give 'Bringing Down the House'3/10 at best",Bringing Down the House
16,dromasca,Nothing Special,6,31 October 2003,"Quite a banal comedy, in the pleasant low-key American comedy style. A divorced, post-mid-aged lawyer meets in an Internet triggered blind date a fellow female lawyer, who proves to be ... black and felon and fugitive. What follows is an ethnic social sit comedy, the tradition of the 50s or 60s. It is amazing that this banal and quite rose watered comedy triggered that many serious comments from the American viewers, some accusing the authors of .. racism. Yes, it is based on stereotypes, but so is any ethnic comedy. I found no malice in the ethnic jokes, and maybe the only fault is in the politically correct balance it ties to keep between the humor scenes about whites and black. Otherwise, it is not really great cinema, just TV level comedy. Do not spend your money or time to watch it in the theaters, but you can rent the video or DVD if you are after easy entertainment. If you want to see some better ethnic theme comedies, look for the British films, or even watch the American 'Big Fat Greek Wedding'. 6/10 on my personal scale.",Bringing Down the House
17,g-bodyl,A little too stereotypic!,7,9 December 2007,"I saw this movie when I bought it at a garage sale. I thought that the film was good, but it could have been better. We see these kind of films in Hollywood all the time where the black people are better than the white people. They are racist, but these films get a little tiring after a while. This time, Steve Martin plays Peter Sanderson and Queen Latifah plays Charlene. Charlie is a convict and Sanderson, a lawyer wants no part of her. But, Charlene is desperate for a lawyer to clear her name. Peter Sanderson refuses but he eventually gives in. Martin and Latifah were funny. Eugene Levy is sort of annoying. The script was alright, but it worked to some degree. Overall, this movie has too many stereotypes, but the movie itself was good and funny. I rate this film a 7/10.",Bringing Down the House
18,tabuno,One of the Funniest Movie in Years,8,26 January 2019,"7 March 2003. This hilarious movie offers the most laughs from an audience that I've heard in years. This entertaining comedy revs up the laughs and comedy factor higher than it has been since The Full Monty (1997) and maybe even Tootsie (1982). The interplay between Queen Latifah and Steve Martin (he's a wild and crazy guy) is great, the jokes and pratfalls, the physical comedy to die for. There are the prerequisite serious dramatic moments. It's also an above average, intelligent movie with having something good to say about race and the usual lawyer at work, ignoring family syndrome.There are a number of problems with the movie - the female fight scene bordered on R-rated violence, senseless viciousness that almost destroyed the humor of the movie cold, the overt sexual prostituting of a woman to climb the ladder was also quite heavy handed, and finally, the climax of the movie seemed to jerk abit with a scene left out, creating a discontinuity.Overall, though, this movie really hit it big with the audience, the loud, roar of repeated giggles - really sparked the crowd up. Bringing Down the House literally had the people shaking in their seats - a great treat of 2003. 8 out of 10 stars.",Bringing Down the House
19,FiendishDramaturgy,Racially and socially offensive,5,13 August 2003,"I'm not a prude by any definition of the word, but this movie was very abrasive. I'm Native American and was just waiting for the racial slur that would hit me hardest. I was spared, but Latin/Americans, African/Americans and basically anyone who is not white bread upper-middle to middle-upper class was targeted.OK, where's my sense of humor? It went out the window when Betty White made the comment ""Ok, but if I see them in this neighborhood without a leaf blower in their hands..."" referring to the ""bunch of Latins who were skulking around"" the neighbor's property which was for sale. It was racially offensive, socially abrasive and not in a funny way.I wanted to like this movie. I love and adore Steve Martin. I have and own every movie he's ever made. I've watched him since he began in stand up BEFORE Saturday Night Live.I also respect Queen Latifah for all she's done for herself and her life. Her acting abilities are WAY WAY up there, as she proves in this movie, but why she didn't take out the director and the screenwriters I don't think I'll ever know.The movie was funny when it wasn't making me cringe or just stare at the screen in horror of what was being said. But it was the least intelligent of Martin's latter endeavors.On a happier note, Kimberly J. Brown was a shining (co-)star in this movie. Her stellar performance as Annie Wheaton, in Craig R. Baxley's ""Rose Red"" (Stephen King, Lion's Gate Home Entertainment, 2002) is only realized when we see her cast in the role of Steve Martin's daughter. She is amazingly talented and not afraid to just cut loose and be herself on camera.

There's a scene with Betty White that is laugh out loud hilarious. And the dinner scene is very funny as well. I really enjoyed the funny dialogue and script. No, this movie is not funny all the time, but it is in certain moments. The movie also teaches very good messages and is sweet and heart warming.

24,rosscinema,Ridiculous script is full of stereotypes,2,22 July 2004,"Hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on a film even if they have to keep dragging out stereotypes and putting them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This effort is a clear example of that and I really do believe in my heart that a film like this is racially irresponsible. Story is about a divorced lawyer named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) who has been chatting with a lady on his computer and when he finally meets her she turns out to be the opposite of what he was expecting. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a stocky black woman who has no intentions of dating Peter but instead wants him to look at her case where she was convicted of robbery. He wants her to leave for good but she keeps popping up at inappropriate times and to save his job he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts involving her case.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Peter has his kids staying with him and Charlene turns out to be helpful in raising them but suddenly a news bulletin announces that an escaped convict named Charlene Morton has broken out of prison. Peter tells her to leave when the FBI comes snooping around but he figures out that she is in fact innocent when her old boyfriend shows up and threatens him.This film is directed by Adam Shankman who keeps things moving at a nice pace and it is a good looking film technically speaking but the script is just so improbable and every character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 film called ""The Landlord"" is clearly more in tune with race relations than this mess. I have always been a big fan of Martin and I think he's one of the most talented persons around but he loves to work constantly and at times just seems to pick any script handed to him. On the other hand, I've always had a problem with Latifah and the way she barges into the life of Martin is so over the top that she instantly becomes ingratiating. Basic premise that Hollywood loves to use is the hip black person showing uptight whitey to loosen up and then pass on some street logic that will help them with their lives. That's basically what the story is here but of course they have to let Martin dress black and overact like a retarded Eminem because Hollywood knows that this is what viewers want. Well, I was pretty much insulted by everything in this film and it's not because I don't have a sense of humor but unfortunately (For Hollywood, anyway) I use logic and common sense when I watch a film. Yes, I enjoyed Eugene Levy's talking jive but are we really suppose to believe that he would be instantly attracted to Latifah? I guess weirder things have happened and how many times does a main actor get shot only to be saved by something in their pocket? Wouldn't a cell phone shatter if struck by a bullet? Even if your the most die hard Martin and Latifah fan I wouldn't recommend this.

It's a little pushy in its message at points, but ultimately it's funny, and that message is basically togetherness and cooperation so there is some allowable forgiveness.I do feel like they casted very well for this, both Queen Latifah and Steve Martin have the skill and finesse to make this movie good. Eugene Levy was a great cast as well, and Missi Pyle is always a fun choice.

Coming out in 2003, ""Bringing Down the House"" was a movie about two different worlds coming together; probably not the first, and the result is some hilarity! Steve Martin plays a divorced lawyer trying to juggle his work-life and spending time with his two kids, and Queen Latifah is an escaped prisoner (as you probably already know). The plot of Martin's lawyer trying to find love and unexpectedly running into Latifah's straight-up ""sister"" personality results in a pretty hilarious film! Add in Eugene Levy's ""down white guy"" persona, and you have the makings of some very funny moments! Some may argue that this film relies too much on typical plot lines, ""been-there-done-that"" routines, and stereotypes, but that's not the case.This movie is a very funny and enjoyable romp. Meaningless fun. A laugh out loud. Don't get me wrong, Steve Martin does shine especially in the scene where his daughter is relaying the events of a party that a dad just doesn't want to hear. Following Latifa's character's advice to stay cool to gain her trust, he bites his tongue and instead of going mad, says, ""That was some party""! Overall, 'Bringing Down The House' is funny and very entertaining film that you will not regret watching, although it could have been a little better with a better script, the acting was brilliant all round, and it does work pretty well, especially with Steve Martin as the main character who is very funny as usual.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Bringing Down the House
27,mjw2305,"Reasonably Funny, but sadly just average",6,28 December 2006,"Peter Sanderson (Martin) is a divorced, very straight laced, workaholic lawyer. When he meets Charlene (Latifah) in an online chat room claiming to be a Barrister, he is shocked to find she is in fact an escaped convict and she wants him to clear her name. We follow the story of the unusual couple as Charlenes dependency on Peter becomes a two way thing with a few laughs along the way.This is certainly not one of Steve Martin's better films, despite his performance being very good along with Eugene Levy's, but i did find Queen Latifah became quite annoying by the end of the film.As a comedy it is OK for a few laughs and is worth a watch.6/10",Bringing Down the House
28,BrandtSponseller,Light sketch comedy/drama,8,10 February 2005,"Tax lawyer Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) has been falling for Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) over the Internet. She's sent him a picture of herself, but she was just a tiny figure in the background, being led out of a courthouse in jail clothes and cuffs by two cops, while in the foreground, there was a young, thin, white yuppie-looking female lawyer talking to a reporter. Sanderson believes that Charlene is the yuppie and arranges a date. Of course he's surprised at Charlene's appearance (Latifah is black, ""thick"" and streetwise in the film) and the fact that she's a con who has done time. Charlene's motivation is to acquire affordable, quality legal services to clean up her record--she swears she's innocent.Ostensibly a film that would comically explore the serious issue of racism (and other kinds of appearance preconceptions) between two very different communities, Bringing Down the House is more a series of loosely tied gags. It plays like a sketch film, with the theme/subtext as a unifying factor. At that, the gags or sketches are mostly successful, although the film is not quite funny enough to work as an outrageous comedy and not quite serious enough to work as a ""message film"", even though it may occasionally come close on both accounts.The three members of the principle cast--Martin, Latifah and Eugene Levy--are good, with Levy being underused, but for me, some of the best material arrived with the supporting cast. Joan Plowright as the wealthy Mrs. Arness, Kimberly J. Brown as Peter's former sister-in-law Sarah, and Betty White as Mrs. Kline, Peter's neighbor all routinely stole the show when they appeared. They were given the most outrageous material, with Arness and Kline being particularly racist. White's character is similar in tone to her excellent supporting role in Lake Placid (1999), although she was underused here.For some, it may be an asset that the film tries to veer away from becoming cartoonish. I think it would have benefited from moving further into absurdist territory--for my tastes, even though Martin has had many great films, he has never surpassed The Jerk (1979), but that's too much of a personal preference for me to really count it as a flaw. It's also interesting that scripter Jason Filardi tries to work in a mostly serious crime/drama subplot towards the climax, but it's a bit too little, too late, and is an odd change of tone, even though the comedy bits surrounding the subplot are good. On the serious side, other than the material about racism, the strongest aspect is that Charlene teaches Peter how to be a better parent and family man. A couple scenes on that end were actually moving.Overall, Bringing Down the House is a bit of a mixed bag, but approached as a light ""sketch comedy/drama"", it is entertaining. My rating occasionally leaned towards a 7, but remained closer to a 7.5 or 8.",Bringing Down the House

I laughed quite a bit. But there are many things about the film that are a mess. For instance, when Steve Martin goes inside that club in the end of the film, the second he got in there, they would've booted his ass outside. He wouldn't ever pass off as a gangster. It's just ridiculous. Another thing that I had a problem with was that the film was racist. There were some moments in the film that were retarded. Like when they are faking the sex or whatever the hell they were doing. That part was stupid. But there are many funny moments. Like when Missi Pile and Queen Latifa fight. It's awesome. Bringing down the house is a hit and miss. It's both pretty equal. Though I think the film is flawed, i still liked it in some way. I laughed, but it was sort of silly.

35,movieguy1021,Bringing Down the House: 7/10,7,22 March 2003,"In Adam Shankman's new comedy Bringing Down the House that is stereotyped but still funny, Steve Martin is Peter Sanderson, a divorced tax attorney. He's wealthy, but never can keep promises to his kids George and Sarah (Angus T. Jones, The Rookie, Kimberly J. Brown, A Bug's Life). They live with his ex-wife Kate (Jean Smart), but visit him occasionally. Peter's called upon to work on the will and estates of Mrs. Arness (Joan Plowright), along with her dog William Shakespeare. He works with Howie (Eugene Levy), who is about to become smitten with Charlene.Charlene is an internet buddy of Peter's, and they soon arrange a date. Instead of a young, blond reporter, he gets a giant, busty black felon played by Queen Latifah. As you could guess, things don't work out in the beginning, and she wrecks havoc on his suburban, SUV, white bread life.I laughed a good deal, mainly during the second half, but I felt like they tried too hard to HAVE stereotypes. Charlene is a jive-talking girl, uses and omits wrong words, etc. On the other hand, Peter's neighbor, and his boss's mother Mrs. Kline (Betty White) is racist, who gets upset when she `hears Negro' over at Peter's house. I'm not saying it isn't funny, but it is racist. I thought that Levy was quite good, although it did seem like it wasn't coming naturally to him. In the theater, everyone cracked up at the line, `You've got me straight trippin', boo,' a line that has been used multiple times in the commercials, and wasn't funny then, and isn't funny now. I think that audiences these days laugh when they think they need to laugh. They need to be spoon-fed, etc., but I digress.An interesting note: Charlene's last name in this movie is Morton, which was also her last name in Chicago. I thought she did great, but I don't really see how she can move from an independent studio blockbuster to a racist comedy (but then again, Catherine Zeta-Jones did move from The Phantom to Chicago). Of course, things get more and more implausible as the movie progresses, but it's a pleasant and funny diverter, so you won't notice.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for language, sexual humor, and drug material.",Bringing Down the House

Instead, Queen Latifah is the one that Steve Martin has been writing to. From watching this film at a certain view, I felt rather vague to watch a film where good talent is wasted. This is the kind of film, when you watch it, the whites are portrayed 70 percent as bigots than the blacks. The only thing that saved this film was Eugene Levy as Steve Martin's partner in crime.

39,christian123,Very Funny and Very Enjoyable,5,17 May 2005,"Bringing Down the House is a very funny movie and your bound to have a good time. Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) is a lawyer who is having trouble getting his life back on track after his wife, Kate ( Jean Smart), divorces him; he's also adjusting to his new status as a single father. Peter tries an internet dating site and virtually meets ""lawyer-girl,"" an attractive and single fellow attorney. Peter makes a date with her, but the woman who arrives at his door turns out to be Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah), who not only isn't a lawyer, she turns out to be an escaped convict. Charlene explains to Peter that she's strung him along because she's innocent of the crime for which she was convicted, and she needs a top-notch attorney to help prove her case. After some persuasion, Peter agrees to help Charlene out. Though the plot sounds stupid, the execution turned out to be really funny. The story is a little weak though and they could have worked a little more on that. The movie isn't very realistic so you shouldn't go in expecting one. The cast is great and they make this somewhat old material funny. The funniest person is Eugene Levy and he is finally getting the recognition he deserves. Steve Martin returns for his first wide release film in four years. He doesn't disappoint and gives a very funny performance. Queen Latifah is also funny, but she also starts getting annoying by the end of the movie. Jean Smart plays the ex wife of Peter and she's pretty good. The rest of the supporting cast includes Kimberly J. Brown, Joan Plowright, Betty White and Missi Pyle. Adam Shankman directs and this is a large improvement over A Walk to Remember. The racist jokes in the film are a little outdated and sometimes this film does go over the top. I still laughed though as some of the dialog in this film is very funny. While this isn't he funniest film of 2003, its still worth watching. Its 105 minutes long and it starts getting a little boring since they add some unnecessary things. Another good thing about this film is that they didn't use all the jokes in the preview. In the end, this film is worth watching even if its not very memorable.

41,Hancock_the_Superb,"""You've Got Mail"" meets Adam Sandler with Queen Latifah thrown in free! **spoilers**",4,8 March 2003,"The biggest problem I had with ""Bringing Down The House"" is that I've seen this all before.  A large woman and a spry, skinny one having a brutal slapstick fight; a cute dog; pasty old white guys trying to speak in Ebonics; a divorced, dysfunctional family; the old laxative-in-the-food trick - all of that, plus plenty of sexual jokes and distasteful humor, pop up here.Now I'd be lying if I were to say that I didn't laugh a few times - I certainly did.  Steve Martin was occasionally amusing; Queen Latifah was better than I expected (though she's no Claudia Cardinale), and the supporting cast ain't that bad.  It's just, well, I've seen this before.The initial plot is very hard to follow in the first place: Martin's blind Internet date Charlene (Latifah) turns out to be a ""hip"" black girl, fresh out of the joint for a crime she claims she didn't commit.  Well, okay: but that problem is quicky solved, for after about forty-five minutes into the movie, the film devolves into deals with shady black gangsters, a running gag about a racist white heiress (Joan Plowright) Martin's firm is trying to make a client, and by the end, it degenerates into a full-on caper.Another very basic problem is the length.  This film lasts at least two hours - and this material could've been stretched over maybe seventy-five minutes (and at that leaner time, it may very well have been better).One thing about this film that surprised me was how overtly racist the white characters are: nearly all of the main white characters (save Martin and his friend Howie, played by Eugene Levy) are condescending towards Charlene, for whatever reason.  I just didn't find this funny - save a single scene where Martin is having dinner with Plowright's character, while Charlene pretends to be his cook.The scene with Steve Martin infiltrating a ""blacks only"" nightclub as a gangsta is not funny at all; ""grating"" is the more appropriate term.  And that's about as witty as this gets.  And when Plowright (who is taken into the club in another predictable comedy device) takes to smoking a reefer, I didn't laugh at all - all that popped into my head were the words, ""WHAT THE F*CK IS WRONG WITH THE MPAA?""  This film is full of a lot of gratuitous profanity, which is unnecessary for a PG-13 film.  Lots of drinking and dope-smoking appear in this.  At least there isn't a lot of violence in this.  All this film proves, as Roger Ebert has put it in the past, is that ""The reasoning of the MPAA should be handed over to the team that cracked Enigma.""While I did laugh, I didn't like ""Bringing Down The House"" as much as thought I would - or enough to recommend it.  It takes a ""You Got Mail""-esque premise and does nothing with it.  Now there are obviously those who disagree with me - there was, as I expected, much laughing during the Steve Martin in the 'Hood scene, so maybe my review isn't for you.  But if it isn't, then don't bother reading it.Four stars.",Bringing Down the House
42,ilovedolby,Just a simple flick that gives a few good laughs!,7,23 February 2003,"Steve Martin is by far a comic genius. If you have ever had the pleasure of watching his antics on old episodes of Saturday Night Live, then you know what I mean. Who could forget his King Tut performance? His work on other comedies over the years has been fair. He made some good light-hearted films such as the Father of the Bride series. He also worked with the late John Candy in 1987s, Plains, Trains, and Automobiles. But my favorite Steve Martin film has to be The Jerk; with its brand of 'slap stick' humor, I always bust a gut laughing. Bringing Down the House, also stars another comic gem, Eugene Levy. Levy is best remembered as Jim's dad in the American Pie films. However, forget American Pie if you want to watch Levy at his best. See Best In Show, a mockumentary from director Christopher Guest. It will have you in stitches. However, the real 'scene stealer' of Bringing Down the House is Queen Latifah. Latifah is hilarious in this role, and with her appearing in the critically acclaimed musical, Chicago, Latifah is becoming a box-office sensation. Bringing Down the House tells the story of divorcee, Peter Sanderson (Martin) who spends some of his personal time on the Internet, instant messaging a woman he met in a legal chat room. His interest in her grows into light infatuation after receiving a picture of her. But when the two meet, he gets a big surprise. She's not the woman in the picture; at least not the woman seen up close in the picture. It turns out that she is an African American woman on parole named Charlene Morton (Latifah). She begins to take over his life, but perhaps that's a good thing. Despite his divorce, he and his ex-wife Kate (Jean Smart), still have feelings for each other. Having divorced because of his excessive work habits, Charlene tries to teach Peter to enjoy life and take it for all that its worth.Performances in this film range from fair to good. Among other comic talents besides Martin and Levy, the film co-stars Betty White, formally of the television show The Golden Girls. White is hilarious in anything she does. Her character in this film is an elderly lady who is a neighbor of Peter's. However, she is as racist as they come, making comments to Martin's character, Peter, that one night, she thought she heard, `Negroes.' Don't take her comments to heart, though. The film is just trying to show how some people can really be bigots. White also left audiences in hysteria after her performance in the 1999 flick, Lake Placid. Another veteran actress in this film was Joan Plowright. She portrays an heiress who is a client of Martin's character, Peter. She proves to be amusing at various times during the film, mainly when she ends up smoking marijuana in a nightclub. Plowright has been seen in such other films as 101 Dalmatians, and Dennis the Menace. Bringing Down the House was directed by Adam Shankman, who brought us the romantic comedy, The Wedding Planner. Now there's one film I wouldn't like to be associated with! Also to his credit are A Walk to Remember and Cosmo's Tale. He does a fair job in directing this picture, but the story is as predictable as the day is long. But then again, I guess that really doesn't matter here. This is just a simple flick that gives a few good laughs. My one problem with this film was the under-use of actor, Eugene Levy. Levy is a great comic actor and to not use him to his full capacity is a waste of acting resources. Look for Levy in the upcoming mockumentary, A Mighty Wind, directed by Christopher Guest who brought us Best In Show and Waiting For Guffman. As for Bringing Down the House, expect a cute film will leave you laughing long after viewing. **1/2",Bringing Down the House

In a year of disappointing movies, Bringing Down The House is kind of a breath of fresh air. I say ""kind of"" because the film has some definite weaknesses. It definitely has its moments but it suffers from an uneven screenplay. Uneven Screenplays are actually quite common in comedies today. Liar Liar was a comedy that suffered from this but it had a consistently hilarious performance from Jim Carrey that I could forgive this. Sadly, while the performers here do good jobs they dont match Carrey's performance. Bringing Down The House's comedic parts of the script are good but the dramatic parts are not so good. They are sub-par writing and you want them to be over fast.
The actors seem to be having a good time. Steve Martin shows his comedic talent here and he is the most consistently amusing one in the film. Queen Latifah does good but is overshadowed by Martin. Surprisingly, Eugene Levy doesn't do any scene-stealing work. He has his moments but nothing really great. Joan Plowright is very smug in her role. Bringing Down The House is a reasonably entertaing movie and it is worth watching. But its nothing I would have the desire to see again.

If they just aren't funny, like this turkey, that's when we start noticing all the bad stuff.And there is plenty of bad stuff, believe me, starting with Steve Martin, who exhausted his tiny bag of comedic tricks more than twenty years ago and who has been coasting along ever since. I think this movie is where he finally coasts to a dead stop. Please, Hollywood, just leave him there.And then there's the story. Bringing Down the House is a clash-of-cultures movie evidently written by people who don't have a clue about either of the cultures involved in the clash.

There was nothing original about it.  Every gag in the film, and the story line itself, is recycled material.Steve Martin was good, but even his performance was a rehash of stuff he's done before (watch for the ""wild and crazy guy"" dance, circa 1978 or so). Eugene Levy mainly played Eugene Levy, which he's good at doing, but, again, it's nothing we haven't seen before.  Queen Latifah as Charlene is relatively believable, but her performance isn't anything to write home about.  She's very good at mugging for the camera; her facial expressions in this film are exaggerated enough to remind one of a silent film.A few cute moments and worth a laugh or two.  I'm not entirely sure who the target audience for this film is, but it does seem to be doing well at the box office.  My favorite thing about it has nothing to do with the overt racial agenda, which is so blatant that it doesn't even bare talking about. Instead, I like the fact that the lead female character isn't skeletally skinny, but is still portrayed as attractive (and I think she's drop dead sexy, in fact, but that's just me!)Overall, I'd give this film a 5 out of 10, but it gets an extra point for Queen Latifah delivering the line ""Go ahead, grab these.""

Brining down the House tells the story of black woman in prison who befriends a lawyer over an Internet chat site. Eventually, she escapes, hunts him down and bribes him into looking into her case and having her record exponged. This leads to a series of disjointed comedy sketches with Martin and Queen Latifa that do not flow into a movie - it is more like a checklist. The accidental sex scene, the chick fight, the conservative old racist woman who suddenly gets stones and tolerant all at once, the fish out of water scene of Martin in a night club .... the list goes on. Not that these are not funny by themselves, but they do not flow into a coherent satisfying movie that I can recommend. Joan Plowright and Eugene Levy provide excellent supporting roles. But the script here is weak and the editing is very poor. The result is choppy mess.

48,marbleann,Olivier must be Spinning and Laughing in his grave...,7,22 April 2005,"I am normally not a fan of these type of movies. But one night I was up and it was on the TV and to my surprise I actually thought it was funny. It is a very broad type comedy. Something that Jerry Lewis would of done in his heyday with Dino playing the Levy part. The Queen plays a escaped con trying to clear herself. When she shows up at Martins door for a blind date and points out she was indeed in the picture of the women he thought was going to date it was hilarious. No big deal but a quick funny scene which explains why she is there. She is a very good actress. I have never seen her play a role badly. I have seen her in bad movies but she is always good. Now only if they do the Pearl Bailey story because she looks and talks just like her. I guess Steve Martin being a TAX lawyer is suppose to tell us he is more then a little uptight. He is out to woo a rich client played by Dame Joan Plowright who has one of the funniest offensive scenes I have ever seen in a movie. Only in Mel Brooks movies could that scene be pulled off but she does a good job. It just shows what a great actress can do to a part which is very insensitive. She goes to dinner one night at Martins house and Queen is forced to play a maid. Plowright starts reminiscing about one of the old maids that worked for her when she was young. Then she starts singing this ""Negro Spiritual"" that Ivy's brother after a day in the tobacco fields use to sing.. Is massa going to sell us tomorrow... Like in the Springtime For Hitler mode it sounds so revolting but it is hilarious. Sir Larry must be spinning in his grave. The movie had racist characters such as Martins ex sister in Law who preyed on sick old men. It is established that she is a real bad guy. The part which really bothered me was the Eugene Levy attack of Jungle Fever character. He din't like Charlene because she was a nice he liked her because of his perception of black women being sexual hot mama's. And he was treated as a sympathetic character unlike the other racist idiots in the movie such as the sister in law, the neighbor and the client. Other then that big problem it was a funny flick. When Martin goes to a night club to confront Charlenes' ex he is in his element..physical comedy. And for once I thought he was funny.

Of course the middle-aged white man is completely defenseless when it comes to her highly witty & clever means of accomplishing her goal. He can't think for himself. This type of person just bewilders him. What will she do next ? He's completely at her mercy. If he could only have help with this.

I'm not up on my ""reality"" TV shows, but I have been noticing film after film written by some guy or girl who has no other movie to his or her credit.  It's not that I'm against bringing new talent into Hollywood, but so far the ""talent"" part of the ""new"" equation hasn't happened.  Jason Filardi, the writer of Bringing Down the House, and the latest in a screenwriting sea of freshman ineptitude, has created one of the most laughably bad comedies this side of The Sweetest Thing; and none of the juvenile or racist jokes he throws in can save it.  Filardi has managed to create a sort of bizarro world that would stink of racism as far back as the 1960s. In Bringing Down the House, Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) works at a law firm that appears to be segregated, attends a country club so uppity that his intrusive African American ""friend,"" Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) has to pretend that she's a nanny just to avoid trouble, and has a client who is the heiress to her husband's large fortune, who is such a bigot that she starts belting out an odious plantation song at the dinner table where she's being waited on by Charlene, who's still pretending to be a nanny and maid. Last, but definitely not least, is Sanderson's nosy neighbor, Mrs. Kline (Betty White).  The woman is so prejudice that Sanderson, obviously not one willing or able to stand up for himself, hides Charlene when he sees Kline, to avoid any confrontation with his misguided neighbor.  As they sneak the concealed Charlene into Sanderson's home, Mrs. Kline tells Sanderson that she thought she ""heard negro,"" and he denies this by claiming that there's, ""no negro here."" Are you laughing yet?  The fact that Queen Latifah would even act in this picture, much less act as one of its executive producers, boggles the mind.  Maybe next she'll play Aunt Jemima in a series of ads for maple syrup.  And how low will the once great Steve Martin go to save his dying career?  If this racist little ""comedy"" makes a splash, maybe next we'll see him as a white businessman in a comedy musical version of Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored. Eugene Levy has only a small part as Sanderson's partner in law, but, as he does with most films that he's featured in, manages to steal the show. Unfortunately, the only reason he steals this one is by delivering his stereotypical lines better than the rest of the cast.  Maybe as a follow-up to this flick, he and Martin can put on some blackface and appear in an updated version of Amos 'n' Andy.  Intentional, or not, Bringing Down the House is a racist movie.

75,jessied,Let It Crumble,4,7 March 2003,"Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) almost literally brings down the house of successful tax attorney Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) to get his attention in director Adam Shankman's Bringing Down the House, but even Latifah and Martin's commendable performances fail to generate numerous laughs in this slow-paced sleeper.  The trailer editor selected every scene with even the slightest bit of humor to promote this insipid film, which translates into about two minutes of laugh-out-loud moments and one-hundred and three minutes of bland, look-at-your-watch-to-see-how-much-time-is-left material. Like most films in the genre, Bringing Down the House is built entirely on clichés, but unlike successful comedies, this one fails to find a fresh way to present the material and will soon be lost and forgotten in a stale pile of other mediocre films.The predictably predictable plot revolves around race relationships, and specifically deals with race relationships between Caucasians and African-Americans in Los Angeles.  Screenwriter Jason Filardi based the characters almost entirely on stereotypes, but he should not be criticized for this choice as he equally satirizes both racial subcultures and subtly suggests that diversity and integrating diverse populations positively affects everyone involved.  Comedy would not exist if writers did not have the freedom or courage to lampoon reality through exaggeration and innocuous distortion.  Spectators offended by Morton's `hoodish' behavior need to realize that she instigates every positive change that occurs in the film, and more importantly that her speech and behavior are both deliberate choices; she makes this explicit statement in Sanderson's office and frequently demonstrates that she behaves how she wants to behave in any given circumstances.  None of the other caricatures are particularly noteworthy, though Mrs. Kline's (Betty White) superfluous racial slurs seem too cheap and unnecessary even in this base film.Martin manages to add some life to his generic character, but it is Latifah who deserves the most acclaim for lead performance.  She adds attitude to dull dialogue.   She makes viewers take interest even in the most hackneyed situations.  She is rough and tough, but she is endearing and delightfully dynamic.  The intelligence of the character is greatly enhanced by the obvious intelligence of this versatile actress who demands attention every time she appears onscreen.  Eugene Levy delivers a consciously monotonous performance as Martin's assistant, which works well in this film and contrasts nicely with Latifah's dynamism.  The terrific cast chemistry also deserves mention, and one can only lament that Filardi wasn't able to provide this talented cast with a decent script.The rudimentary computer screen opening sequence, despite its clever dialogue, is indicative of the overall quality of Bringing Down the House; the absurd half Tae-Bo, half street-fighting brawl in the bathroom is inexcusable; and the film presents a compilation of related scenes rather than a continuous narrative.  Steve Martin is equally as good if not better in earlier films that provided him with much better roles--go to the movie rental store if you crave his comedy.  Queen Latifah delivers an equally magnificent performance in Chicago--if you must go to the movie theater, purchase a ticket that's actually worth the price of admission.  Whatever you do, stay away from Bringing Down the House, and let this comedic disaster crumble into cinematic oblivion.",Bringing Down the House

78,misslv80,Who's That Girl - Queen Latifah,5,31 October 2003,"""Bringing Down The House"" was not as funny as I expected it to be. Sure, it had its moments. Queen Latifah was funny, sassy, and sexy as ever, and Steve Martin, always the hilarious funnyman, had some great scenes as the uptight, conservative lawyer that Latifah hires to take on her case. I also liked Eugene Levy as Martin's partner who lusts after Latifah. You gotta love the ""You got me straight trippin', Boo"" line, which is probably the funniest in the whole movie. I didn't care much for the prejudiced characters like Betty White as the nosey neighbor across the street from Martin or Martin's high profile client Mrs. Arness. I realized this was meant to be funny, but instead seemed kind of offensive. There were scenes that I knew were meant to be funny, but I didn't find myself laughing. The scene where Latifah teaches Martin's son to read from a girlie magazine and the ""talking dirty"" scene on the couch could have been done without. The catfight scene between Latifah and Martin's rich bitch, golddigging sister-in-law was funny, in an over-the-top, screwball way.This movie reminded me very much of Madonna's ""Who's That Girl"". Both Latifah and Madonna play characters who were in the slammer for four years who were framed for crimes they didn't commit. Both have a ""rich bitch"" character, an ""uptight, conservative lawyer"" character, a ""young stud"" character, a ""rich old lady"" character, and both movies have the laywer character in a scene where he has to go down to the ghetto to rescue the heroine. But, I digress. If you're a Queen Latifah fan, you'll definitely love this movie as she steals the show. Not the one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, but not one of the worst either. I rate it five out of ten.

Yet this movie just doesn't do it. It definitely has it's funny moments and Steve Martin is always fun to watch. But for such a great cast, it's really rather sub-par. It's a predictable plot, average acting, and certainly some unfunny jokes. Also, a lot of it seemed unneccesary; for instance, the cat-fight scene. Why was that even in there? Despite this though, I would recommend it. The Steve Martin ghetto scene is quite humorous and Eugene Levy is a delight.

85,montoya_luisa,a horrible experience (some minor spoilers),1,27 May 2003,"This film was one of the most offensive films that I have watched in years. There is a big difference between racial jokes and racist jokes and this film crossed the barrier. I do not know it the director Mr Shankman was trying to illustrate some of the racism that is still present with in certain communities. The only thing that I know is that he failed on the attempt and all that he had to show for was a film filled with tasteless jokes, if he needs some help in directing a smart film he can consult Spike Lee a master in intelligently illustrating racial interactions. From the beginning when Steve Martin discovers that his blind date is with a black woman rather than with a ""blonde"" he starts acting like is the end of the world. And to add insult to injury the jokes made by the conservative neighbour (Betty White) were horrible. As a Latin woman I'm offended by jokes like the ones referring to the Latin community which suggests that all of us are only capable of being maids or gardeners. The stupid racist jokes did not stop there but continued all through out the movie... the worst of them being made by Mrs. Arness played by Joan Plowright, during supper at Steve Martin's house. What is most amazing to me is that this time and age a racist film like this can make it to theatres and encounter no opposition! what message is this sending that is ok to be racist during two hours if you put a sweet finale where everybody gets along!! I think not!!",Bringing Down the House

At one point whatever he touched turned to comic gold - Roxanne, Planes, Traines & Automobiles, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels etc. but these last 10-15 years have been awful. It's not so much that films like this aren't as funny as his old stuff - they simply are not funny. They raise the odd smile here and there and are relatively inoffensive - but they are all just blah, blah, blah - instantly forgettable.This film fell into the same trap as Cheaper By The Dozen and practically everything else he has done since his hay-day. I really don't know what market he is trying to cater for - it's certainly not the half-intelligent 25-40 year old males..!

87,natport19,this movie has made enough money already...,4,13 March 2003,"Do not let its $31 million dollar weekend opening fool you.  Aside from a few big laughs delivered by top-notch comedians, Steve Martin and Eugene Levy, Bringing Down the House offers no redemption for your two hours. There is a fine line in which ethnicity can be employed as humor, but, here, the line has been crossed into what results as a relentless blend of typical PG-13 gags and outdated racial stereotyping.  Even if it does cause one to chuckle when it comes from the mouth of an 80+ year old woman, the audience does not need to be constantly reminded that Steve Martin is white and Queen Latifah is black.Relying solely on story conventions and clichés, Bringing Down the House is so painfully average that one can precisely predict at which moment Peter's cell phone will ring to ruin that perfect moment.  And it rings so much that director Adam Shankman's initial use for it was probably to keep the audience awake.  Because when neither Martin nor Levy is giving us the funnies, then it is basically just another walk in the comedy park.In the film's final scenes, our heroes succeed (like you didn't know that was coming) in a climax that last year's Swimfan should justly ovate.  Using up all of the smarts in Filardi's script in a sequence of about ten seconds, it is a good thing that all of the actors taking part in this project already have established careers.  In no way could this movie break any of them, but it surely could not make even the best of them.** out of ****",Bringing Down the House

While watching this one-trick pony, I felt the black movement had been set back by 30 years. How could the talented royal Ms. Latifah stoop to this low? If you get a kick out of seeing bleached white Republicans try to speak ebonics, this is right up your alley. For the other 64 percent of intelligent Americans, stay home and watch reruns of Diff'rent Strokes - it's much more progressive.

89,Lexuses71,A Refreshing And Very Funny Comedy,8,10 March 2003,"Just saw this very surprisingly hilarious film and while I won't rehash the plot (several already have so you get the basic premise), the audience (including myself) sure got some gut-busting laughs from it.
Special kudos to Steve Martin (returning to his sillier 'Happy Feets' SNL days and I'm sure glad to see it), the always funny Betty White (playing the ultimate white racist snob neighboor with some great lines and a pasty smile), my main man, Eugene Levy (""Ya got me straight trippin, Boo!"") who added SO much to what could have been a ho-hum ""best bud"" part, the always dignified veteran Joan Plowright, who played her part with a eccentricly looney twist (and had a few great scenes herself), Missi Pyle, portraying a snotty, condescending, man hungry and obnoxious ex sis-in-law who pops up a little TOO frequently (and convienently). All of these players had thier golden moments in this film that (thank GOD) never got over preachy about ethnic relations, divorce, and most of all, the stereotypes we carry within us all.But I save my greatest praise for Queen Latifah, who certainly shows beyond any doubt that BBWs (Big beautiful Women) can be sexy, funny, intelligent and sensitive. She has really developed noticeably and as another reviewer pointed out, seems much more evolved as an actress. She's got a ton of attitude but you see she's a sweet gal underneath the hard exterior. It's her show here and she displays a lot of natural talent as a comedic actress who has a great career ahead of her. (I have not seen ""Chicago"" but have read she's up for a Supporting Oscar-hope she gets it). I read many of the other comments here, and I can only say that if you didn't enjoy this film for the hilarious escapist and witty film it is, the way it comically pokes at ALL stereotypes, that's YOUR problem. If you are a prude, stay away from it. Yes the plot was somewhat derivative, there were some holes and predictable parts, but BDTH adds a few interesting and fresh twists that make it truly enjoyable. The ""odd couple"" paring of Latifah and Martin was inspired casting-they play off each other very well and had some screamingly funny scenes together. $31 million opening weekend says a LOT of folks ""got it"". And enjoyed it immensely.I give this an 8 out of 10. If you want to have a good laugh and just be entertained, this is a great flick to see.",Bringing Down the House
90,Storm_Mickche,Bringing Down the Trash,5,18 January 2006,"""Bringing Down the House"" was an alright comedy that bases around a former prisoner moving or staying into an attorney's house after they chatted on the internet. The idea to me very simple and there are quite a lot of stars that are in this movie. To me, too much. Sometimes movies flop because of two things, 1. Bad Storyline and 2. Too Many Characters. I was surprised to also see Joan Plowright's character smoking pot and why would she do a movie like this.""Bringind Down the House"" carried on quite a bit and there was a few unnecessary characters portrayed. For example, the lady across the road had no real meaning and not really Eugene Levy's character.Overall, you can have a few laughs with this film but you might get a bit bored in the process because the ending isn't really comedy and didn't have to be set like that. I didn't like the change of moods in a movie. Firstly, its a mistake meeting an ex-con, then later there spying trying to solve the case.

I admit I had a twinge of a smirk when Levy said, ""You got me straight trippin, boo."" but since I had already been treated to that line a minimum of 25 times in the trailer, it lost any humor it may have had.

92,daileybaker,a disturbing racist view of the world that could have been brilliant,2,23 April 2003,"I found this film so disappointing in that it could have been brilliant in its look at race relations through humor.  Instead, it reduced whites to Steve Martin as an uptight wasp who can't dance and has no sexuality; in return, Queen Latifah is the convict who's an angel -- not going to the extremes that the white area goes to.  Of course, the whole premise is too faulty and dangerous to really touch on people's discomfort with humor (like BLAZING SADDLES did).  It's too bad that Hollywood has turned so soft and fearful of offending us viewers.  Instead, it offended me more how blithely it treated race issues, reducing most whites to being racists -- and no one talking about it (or even noticing it?).  Most people want interracial harmony and more understanding, and there are great points for satire about whites and blacks and their interactions that can lead to positive change -- this movie just fell back on cheap stereotypes and in so doing, undermines progress.",Bringing Down the House
93,suntorytime10,You got me straight-trippin' Steve!,9,13 June 2003,"The arguments and opinions of many a film fan and film critic persist about Steve Martin's current position in Hollywood. Many of his doubters believe he is past it, his films becoming horribly run of the mill, turgid and, ultimately, unfunny. The opinions are jointly contributing to the downfall of a once treasured idol. But some have stood by him, myself included, through the thick black cloud that have rested over the white-haired maestro during the last few years of his illustrious career. And with his latest return to our screens, he's back to prove once and for all, that the wild and crazy guy is here to stay.The film sees Martin as lawyer Peter Sanderson, recent divorcee and top-dog at his law firm, who now at the age of god-only-knows, decides to ditch his now ""whack"" existence, and goes 'net surfing for the perfect woman.  He apparently strikes gold with a sex, slim blonde laywer he meets in a chat-room. But he is taken by surprise when his date arrives in the sexy, big-boned, brassy form of escaped convict Charlene (Queen Latifah). Entering his life with a strut that would make Oprah blush, Charlene attempts to convince Peter to re-open her case and help her clear her name. That's not before turning his life upside-down, and posing as his kids' nanny tries to help Peter reclaim that what he so dearly yearns for, his family and wife. How, ahem, sweet. And with all the tomfoolery that ensues comes a girl-on-girl ""bitch-slapping""  session between Charlene and Peter's sister-in-law, a drunken night of dancing and sexual awakening (believe me boys, you've never seen it this way before), and gangster parties louder than Martin's legendary bonnet.Standing up to its title, ""House"" really is a treat. Martin, although not in full-on ""wild and crazy guy"" mode, is on typically top, crowd-pleasing form. His portrayal as the life-searching, middle-aged, toffee-nosed twit is inspired, managing to mix the side-splittingly funny with the touching and poignant to brilliant effect, recalling such affecting form he showed in ""Parenthood"" and ""Bowfinger"". Latifah, meanwhile, shows that she has the potential for greatness. her larger-than-life performance is uproarious, bringing charisma and buoyancy to a largely one-dimensional character. She is also quiet the vixen too. The support from Eugene Levy is also first-class. Playing Peter's best mate, who is ""straight trippin'"" over Charlene, Levy steals practically every scene he appears in, with his dead-pan humour and flawless timing providing the some of the films most painfully funny scenes.The overall quality of the film is pretty standard stuff. The plot is nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before. The writer and director, while both efficient, don't really add anything fresh and exciting to the buddy comedy genre here. That said, when the films funny, it's an absolute hoot, with the cast stealing the show with marvellous chemistry, and giving us three of best comedic turns you're likely to see all year. Delightful **** (out of FIVE)",Bringing Down the House
94,unimportant,"Racist, pointless, not funny",3,10 January 2005,"This is a stupid, pointless, racist movie, offensive to both blacks and whites. It all begins with Peter (Steve Martin) and Charlene (Queen Latifah) connecting in a legal chat room and deciding to meet. Peter, thinking Charlene is a thin blonde lawyer, is surprised to open his door and see an unrefined black convicted felon looking not for a date, but for free legal help. Peter is understandably angry about being deceived, and tries to get rid of her, but she refuses to leave.It would have been simple enough for Peter to call the police and have her arrested, but she threatens to show his boss the e-mails they had exchanged. Presumably, Peter's boss and associates are so racist that they would fire him merely for associating with a black woman, so he agrees to help her. Most of the ""comedic"" moments come from Peter's desperate attempts to hide Charlene's presence from his racist boss, a neighbor (who's the boss's sister), an important client, and a WASPy ex-sister-in-law. For some reason, Peter can't simply explain that Charlene is trying to get legal assistance, so Peter pretends that she's his nanny, maid, and/or representative from a Baptist church. Although Charlene is generally rude, obnoxious, and selfish, she begins to grow on Peter (but not in a romantic way) and his two children, and Peter inexplicably ends up risking both his life and career to clear her name. The entire film makes little sense and isn't even funny. (3/10)",Bringing Down the House

He definitely was not the highlight of the film, something which makes me think that his talents could have and should have been put to better use. The best part of the movie was Eugene Levy hitting on Queen Latifah and his unbridled lust/enthusiasm for her. Other than that, it was okay but not great. There was a good fight scene and a number of truly funny moments, but most of the humor in the film comes from ""Silly White People Acting Black"" which usually just doesn't do it for me... And it didn't really do it for me in this case either (except for Eugene Levy, who was awesome).

The premise was highly suspect, but we were willing to suspend our disbelief long enough to let it work.  Unfortunately, it didn't, and it didn't even come close.Queen Latifah's character was simply obnoxious, and the situations that the writer put forth just were too unbelievable to work as a story.  To make matters worse, in 45 minutes of story, there were no redeeming qualities to either of the main characters, save for Steve Martin's funny trick to win over a client by bribing a waiter.

Witness the sadly-ignored ""Set it Off,"" which is a much better movie than you might expect, and which really showed that Queen Latifah had great potential as an actress. Martin and Latifah deserved a chance to do a good movie together. They could have pulled off a decent movie from a mediocre script.

There's even a rich old client, like in ""All of Me."" You get the feeling you've seen better versions of this movie before, and you're right. We all know the gag from the commercials. Steve Martin thinks he's meeting some thin white lawyer for an internet date, but instead Queen Latifah shows up at his front door. Comedy theoretically ensues.

Layer after layer of trite TV-movie exposition, written in such a way as to show you the path the movie is going to follow as to every single character. Even after Queen Latifah shows up, the exposition just keeps on coming, and coming, and coming. When it stops, you are hoping comedy might ensue, but it just doesn't. In the first 30 minutes of this movie, there are a few amusing moments, and two occasions where you might actually chuckle out loud. That is a pathetic laugh ratio for any comedy, and it is unforgivable given that a truly awful script has dragged two great performers to that level.

It is a voice of expression. Though I'll agree that they are great old movies, the industry is constantly changing and we need to understand a balance between relaying a message and simply entertaining. ENtertaining is good at certain times, but it is not certainly Oscar-worthy.Another problem i had with the movie is its irrelevance to time. Slavery has been expanded upon over and over, its often quite redundant. If i really wanted to delve into the slave persona, or the psyche of that time, I'd read Baldwin.It's not to say that this movie wouldn't be interesting if that were the focus anyway.

113,richardnovak77,"Horrible, stereotypical movie.",2,19 January 2008,"This is another one of those movies where we're forced to watch a clash of two extremely stereotypical groups based on culture, and as usual it's a white Anglo-Saxon protestant (WASP) male and his family who meets the street-smart black gangsta-ish ex-con woman. As usual the conflict arises when the two are forced to get along and develop a friendship while uptight neighbors/bosses/coworkers who aren't okay with mixed-race friendships watch disapprovingly.Unfortunately, this movie has too few laughs to make up for the stereotypical crap. There wasn't a single white person in the movie that wasn't an uptight stereotypical nerd (except for the stereotypical party animal high schoolers), and there wasn't a single memorable black character who was articulate and didn't act like your stereotypical thug or party animal.Steve Martin is one of my favorite comedians (since The Jerk, pick it up if you want to see a movie done right) and Queen Latifah is always a pleasure to watch (beautiful), but this movie just didn't do it for me. I get tired of movies where all the comedy stems from reinforcing stereotypes that are less accurate every year.Yes, there are uptight WASPs in this country, but you know what? I don't know any. They're not as common as this movie portrays (which is everyone). Yes, there are black gangstas in this country but not every black person around. There are a lot of well-spoken, cultured blacks out there. One is Secretary of State. Another is running for President.A little bit of believability would take this movie a LONG way. I don't find a lot of humor in racial stereotypes, not when on the one hand we're supposed to laugh at it here and on the other hand, it's taboo to mention things like this in public. The word Negro is used in this movie so many times but I haven't heard that word used in real life in years (except for some Mormons I went to school with).Anyhow, I'm tired of the stereotypes. 2/10 stars.",Bringing Down the House
114,dbogosian,Let go of your fears. Sit back and enjoy.,10,25 March 2004,"Negative viewers of this movie seem to be as uptight as Steve Martin's character was at the beginnng.It's pretty simple...maybe your all looking into it too much....
His Neigbors are racist, especially the Betty White Character, and he is a pus*y, in the nicest sense of the word. A really nice guy, but a wimp who backs down to his neigbors so as not to ruffle any feathers.
This movie was f ing hilarious. Let go of your defense mechanisms and your critiquing for once. This movie had continuous build-up of laughs until the uproarious/hilarious club sequence in the end. This movie was great. I loved Old School too, and Made, Swingers, and other comedies that gets you with great wit. But sometimes you just need to let go of everything and enjoy a fun comedy that doesn't care to worry about how some Politically Correct Roger Ebert mini-mees' think. So it has stereotypes and cliches to the plot. So what. When Steve Martin pretends to be street in the club while learning on the job and actually wins respect by letting himself flow, it is a sweet moment in Cinema. That dance beat/Hip Hop tune pulses and he gets better and better, until he's the shiznit and growing testicals for the first time in his life.And Queen Latifah and Eugene Levy were HILARIOUS. And that bitch sister in law good too. You really have to be a negative person to not like this pic. Seriously.He grows his balls by the end of the movie and surely wouldn't let Betty White character talk that way again.Queen Latifah character knew all along that he is a nice guy, just a wimp and that's why she made sure to keep pestering him.Wake up...a lot of people in this country aren't really racist and don't believe in specific religions for example, but will pretend to or fools themselves so as to keep belonging to the groups of people they are comfortable with. It's sad and wimpy and brainless, but it happens everyday. That's what Steve Martin's character was. Free your mind of anti-racist psychobabble and art house utopian notions of what quality is.

117,kniht63,what a mess,3,7 June 2003,"(very serious spoilers)this movie was a huge disappointment. there are so many problems i dont know where to start. so, i'll talk about what is good about the film.the cast was great. steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy. queen latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black gal. and eugene levy, well he pretty much plays himself. add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  and if watching these guys for 1.75 hours is worth $8 to you, then you wont be disappointed.but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes. first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone. all the white people are uptight bigots. all the black people are ghetto ebonics-speakers. the blacks are hip, cool, with-it and poor. the whites are nerds, stiff, and rich. (except eugene levy, he is clearly taken with queen latifa and ""speaks the lingo"" - so latifa nicknames him a ""freak"". so - if you're a white man and you like black women and you know street slang you must be a freak). the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character. she comes to martin's home under false pretense, but martin takes a liking to her anyway. she's supposed to be wrongly accused of robbery, martin takes up her cause. 3/4 of the way through the film we find out latifa's character escaped from jail. so, our sympathy for her goes out the window.there is no real plot. the movie plods along from scene to scene with latifa showing up in some place where she's ""not"" supposed to be (like a country club or martin's house) and martin trying to hide her. thats the running gag. then in the last minutes of the film they decide that they're going to finally deal with latifa's assertion that she was wrongly accused of bank robbery. martin goes under cover as a homeboy to extract a (let's face it, unusable) confession from latifa's ex boyfriend, and everyone lives happily ever after.finally (but there is a lot more wrong with this flick) this movie appears to be a hodge-podge of clips from other movies. the premise is clearly borrowed from another martin movie ""the house-sitter"". where goldie hawn comes to live with martin and shakes up his stodgy middle-class life. martin and latifa meet online - ala ""youve got mail"". the whole ""quirky nanny fixes rich man's life"" goes as far back as ""the sound of music"" and ""mary poppins"".i wouldnt see this movie again for free.",Bringing Down the House

119,aheaslip,What a Disappointment.,4,29 March 2003,"I just got back from the theater and haven't read any other reviews yet. I just want to say I was really disappointed with this movie. It fell short of its intentions and way short of good comedy. Queen Latifah, who is a sharp, savvy, sexy woman, is robbed of these qualities by poor writing and poor everything else. There are one or two truly funny moments that are completely run over by stupid physical gags. I like Steve Martin a lot, and his performance in this movie was really a drag. The bright spot here was most definitely Eugene Levy's character, Howie.The worst part is that the racist white characters are so absurd that their attitude gets written off as a joke, missing the point that racism is still a problem, usually showing itself in more subtle ways. And the movie itself perpetuates stereotypes that it supposedly rejects. (As if a woman like Queen Latifah would ever be caught dead in a maid's uniform, taking *@&) from old white ladies.)I had heard that critics bashed this movie, and I usually don't buy in to that stuff- a movie can be entertaining and fun without being great art. I've really been looking forward to seeing the onscreen chemistry between Latifah and Martin, and I went anyway with an open mind, fully expecting a kind of dumb, funny movie that would be enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately, it ended up pretty much wasted time. Sorry!",Bringing Down the House

The white guy acting black has been done before (this is only just a part of the movie), but this movie really nailed it down. The theatre I was in was in an uproar. The story also had some very nice and unexpected twists here and there. Even though there is racism in the movie, they did it in a way as to not offend the public and at the same time make it funny. Underneath the comedy, it actually makes one wonder how elitist the white aristocratic upper-class really do consider themselves.

I was a captive audience on a plane and viewed this film. It was a complete waste of time. I enjoyed Martin in earlier films, but not this one. Same for Queen Latifah, she was excellent in Chicago and in Set it Off she was good too, but this role was horrid.I mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script. I feel strongly you can't save a formulaic, unfunny script with decent actors, this movie as a case in point. Still, all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film.

The screenwriter must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there - it certainly is about the least imaginative movie I've seen in a long time - I knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it began.  The African-American stereotypes and slave references are pretty offensive as well.  But the thing that was the worst for me was to see Martin in a movie without a trace of wit.  He probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally dumbed down script.  He must be behind in his alimony to be in such a lame effort.",Bringing Down the House
127,moonshot71,Predictable (some spoilers),2,8 May 2004,"The number one movie this past weekend was Bringing Down the House.  In just three weeks this movie has made over 83 million dollars.  Five of those dollars were mine, and I want them back.  All five of them! Steve Martin is the star of many box office hits such as: Father of the Bride and Parenthood, and the critically acclaimed writer of Roxanne, L.A. Story, and the cult classic ¡Three Amigos!  He's a star most people feel they can trust with their valuable time and money.  Despite all of his success, Martin's career is littered with some real stinkers, for example, My Blue Heaven, Housesitter, and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. These bad movies seem to amplify his successes by contrast.   But this movie is easily the worst Steve Martin has ever made. I should have seen the warning signs.  The movie was produced by Ashok Amritraj, who lost his shirt producing Battlefield Earth and Jane Bartelme who put money into the inspirational RoboCop 3.  It was written by a rookie, Jason Filardi.  And it was directed by Adam Shankman, who worked on such classics as She's All That, Deuce Bigalow, and Tank Girl. Riding the success of her Oscar nod for Chicago is Martin's co-star, Queen Latifah.  Following in the steps of such pop stars as Britney Spears and Mariah Carie, the queen if the rap world has decided to break into acting with as bad of a movie as humanly possible.  Or maybe she's using Martin's formula: one good movie, two bad, and so on. Anyway, this movie is about a thuggish black woman who moves in with a rich, up-tight, white guy.  Take a moment and think about that scenario for a second.  Even if you haven't seen a preview for this film, you can probably guess what happens.  He teaches her to be a successful member of society, she helps him loosen-up.  All the while, pouring on the racial stereotypes and clichés.  She even teaches him how to dance.I couldn't believe how little effort was put into creating believable and interesting characters and storylines.  Steve Martin is the white layer, complete with a grey suit, a cell phone, and two kids.  Queen Latifah is the poor black woman: wild, rude, unemployed, and uneducated with an extensive criminal record.  Latifah embarrasses Martin in front of his co-workers. Martin gets mad when she throws a big `black' party (drinking, smoking, rap music; etc.). Why do powerful people in Hollywood make movies like this?  Do they lack a creative drive?  Why do we go see them?  Do we lack higher expectations? I hate to think of all the great scripts that were turned down by the studios, to make room for movies like Bringing Down the House.  I also realize that this trend will continue as long as we keep shelling out our hard earned cash. The Shawshank Redemption, which the International Movie Data Base (www.imdb.com) ranks as the second best movie ever made, only earned $28 million (it cost $25 million to make).  Bringing Down the House will easy make over $100 million at the box-office and another hundred million in video sales.  After seeing this movie I felt ripped off.  I guess crime does pay. I love movies.  I believe filmmaking can be one of the most powerful art forms; a medium that can evoke a wide spectrum of true emotion.  If done correctly an audience may laugh or cry, experience love or loneliness; or ponder concepts that they have never encountered.  But if done poorly, a film can leave an audience feeling bored, apathetic, or even angry. This year, at least thirteen sequels will be released.  My only hope is that Bringing Down the House 2: Longer and Even More Pointless will not be added to the list.",Bringing Down the House
128,doug16,Need a good laugh?,7,5 March 2003,"We were pleasantly surprised by the entertainment value of this movie. Like all movies, this one has its slow parts, but these slow parts were made up two-fold by all the snappy phrases and jokes being passed around.  It was hilarious!  And pretty clean, too.  It's the story about a man, Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin), and a woman, Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah), who meet on the internet - he's a high profile tax attorney with a spotless background - she's a prison escapee who's trying to clear her name of ""a crime she didn't commit.""  It's a case of mistaken identity, as you'll see.So much of the film deals with Peter trying to ignore Charlene, and trying to claim he's never seen her before, and the hilarious situations this causes for everyone.This flick will make you think back to the 60's or '70's as you watch Peter get ready for his first date in a long time (he recently divorced his former wife, played by Jean Smart.)  Things like:  the way he tries to pull his sweater over his head without messing up a single strand of hair, the way he fluffs his shirt collar, and, oh, my, God, the way he tries to dance! Talk about the '70's.  You have to see it to believe it!Betty White plays Steve's nosy, racist neighbor who lives across the street. But her role is not much developed beyond that.  I love Betty; she is funny, and deserved more from this movie.Then there's (Designing Women) Jean Smart's sister (Missi Pyle), a woman you have to watch out for.  Missi and Charlene have a well choreographed fight in a restroom that will leave you in stitches.  Missi is also trying to get hitched to ANY man with money, so beware.Then there's William Shakespeare, the dog, who belongs to a very prim and proper British lady (played by Joan Plowright) who has a multi billion dollar insurance and tax contract whose account everyone at the firm is trying to land.  She has some very funny scenes, especially the one at the Down Up Bar (""you don't go in there unless you're a junkie, a cop, or a corpse""...)Steve's character has 2 children, a young boy who's a little slow,  who has trouble reading until Charlene shows him a girlie magazine.  To make the point that he has learned something, he asks his dad ""what's a rack"" and Peter quickly quips that it's a country.The other child is a sixteen year old daughter, who is saved from serious trouble one night by Charlene, who does what it takes to make the boyfriend apologize.Peter's partner Howie (Eugene Levy), falls in love with Charlene, and he makes it known by saying, ""the cool points are all out the window, and I'm all twisted up in the game...""  (what the heck did he say?)Two of the funniest scenes in the whole movie are when Joan Plowright walks in on Charlene, who's trying to show a drunk Peter Sanderson how to show a woman a good time.  The other is when Joan is getting stoned with two ""brothers"" in the Down Up.Good pace, put together well, I say 2/4, or B+, or 7/10.Go see it if you need a good laugh.",Bringing Down the House

In general, the script wasn't particularly funny and a fair bit of it bordered upon unpleasant. For example, were there, in 2003, really still neighbourhoods in the US where the sight of a black person would cause great surprise (note Betty White's contribution)? The film lacked heart and humour and was predictable throughout - I find it quite hard to believe that those involved became and remained involved on a project such as this.

No, this movie's appeal mostly lies in Steve Martin learning how to talk gangsta and Queen Latifah bringing some tough ghetto comedy to the screen.  Many lines were also meant to poke fun at racist people that demean Queen Latifah's character.

It's well worth seeing and I hope that you all enjoy it.",Bringing Down the House
147,bhall35,Appalling,1,2 March 2003,"Saw a sneak preview the other night. I couldn't believe how awful this movie is.Of course, the audience had a grand time, which just confirms how low our expectations for a mainstream Hollywood comedy now are. Nobody in the picture could save it (not even the usually reliable Eugene Levy).There is real potential in the satiric possibilities of white and black cultures colliding and assimilating, but it remains unexplored here, since the director has a hard enough time figuring out where to place the camera and how to stage simple shots (the editing is particularly atrocious).  Some will say that is too much to expect from a simple comedy,  but I say see my first paragraph and save your money, or better yet, spend it on renting a Preston Sturges comedy to see how it's done.",Bringing Down the House
148,shubbard-1,Steve Martin's does his thing and QL finally gets some good material,7,25 February 2003,"If you generally like Steve Martin (up tight Beverly Hills white guy) and the prospects of him sparing with a funny, out there, vocal black woman (Queen Latifah) then you will have a fun time at this movie.  The writing has clever moments, the performances good, and the supporting cast provide good foils for the two stars to play off.  However, if your favorite movie is ""My Dinner with Andre"" or ""Out of Africa"", you should probably avoid it and see `The Hours'.",Bringing Down the House
149,arenahomes,Great movie,10,8 March 2003,"I loved this movie.  I thought Steve Allen was fantastic.  He was so ""naturally"" funny without trying to be funny.  Queen Latifah was such a good combination with Steve Martin.  I hope they make a Bring down the house II. I haven't laughed that hard at a movie in a long time.  And I thought it was a pretty clean movie too.  I brought my 10 and 11 year old to watch the movie and they loved it too.  The whole theater was laughing their heads off!! Great JOB!!",Bringing Down the House
150,atsejp,Very Funny..I didn't laugh like that a long long time ago!,10,8 March 2003,Excellent thematic - Black/White way of life and associated stupidities. Deep concepts through very funny scenes...Really really enjoying!!! I do recommend it! Better have a good breath!,Bringing Down the House
151,coffee-1,This movie is the bomb,10,22 March 2003,"I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie, especially the fight scene, it was great.  Steve Martin is hilarious, especially at the club. Charlene scared me a bit at first, but at the end, you fall in love with her.  Go see it, you will not regret it.",Bringing Down the House
152,Bridge9,Steve Martin a rich white lawyer meets Charlene and he needs her help even more than she needs help from him.,10,24 March 2003,AWSOME. Funniest movie I have seen in a long time. People were laughing so hard in the theater that I will have to see it again just to hear the lines I missed!! The movie was great. Everyone should go see this movie. Best Comedy ever.,Bringing Down the House
153,pjcharsley,An offensive parade of crass racial stereotypes,1,9 June 2003,"Sets race relations back at least 20 years with its portrayal of white folks as uptight losers and black folks as lazy criminals with a great sense of rhythm.Hard to believe that the great American public lapped up this pap, which would have been racially offensive in 1953, let alone 2003.Would have walked out of the cinema but was transfixed by the horrors unfolding on screen.",Bringing Down the House
154,ppcomfort,we never laughed so much,10,10 June 2003,"this movie was a great stress reliever, we were so depressed when walked in personal/ financial reasons, this movie made us laugh so much we forgot our tears. excellent movie!!!!!!!!!!!!! we would recommend this movie in a heartbeat. people should loosen up more and see the talent and hard work put into this films entertainment level. people can be anal sometimes.",Bringing Down the House
155,bigbadjohn_1,Disapointing,5,5 August 2003,"I found the movie Bringing Down The House very disappointing. It was not as good as I thought it would be. There were a few funny parts in the movie, but not as many as I thought there would be. The acting was alright. Steve Martin could have done a much better job. I'd rate this movie 5 out of 10.",Bringing Down the House
156,nikdirga,Blah,6,13 August 2003,"`Bringing Down The House,' a surprise $130 million hit this spring, is one of those periodic `wacky' race-mixing comedies Hollywood is so fond of churning out, stories that have very little resemblance to real life.This is one of those movies where most of the funniest bits were already shown in the trailer. It's got nothing new to say, relying on the lazy stereotype that white folks are uptight and only those crazy black folks can loosen them up. `House' is never racist, but parts of it do leave an unpleasant taste.I'll watch Steve Martin in just about anything (heck, I even like `Three Amigos'), but he's slumming here. He has some great moments, but his character is just another standard-issue loser white dude. It shies away from saying anything truly edgy about race relations (for a funny and insightful comedy about an uptight white guy in a black world, see Warren Beatty's terribly underrated 1998 film `Bulworth). It's passable as entertainment, but given the possibilities, it's forgettable and sloppy as a movie.",Bringing Down the House
157,mrdoubtfire06,I loved this movie and bought it the day it came out on DVD!,9,12 September 2003,"I think this movie really shows how Queen Latifah can distinguish between her acting and singing.  She does a great job in this movie along with Steve Martin!  They play very well together.  Betty White also plays an outstanding role as the nosey, rude next door neighbor.  Even though she only has a few lines, her expressions are hilarious and the lines she does have put me on the floor laughing.  It would be awesome if they made a sequel to this movie and I'd be sure to see it too.",Bringing Down the House
158,Sunnyrap,"Much, much better than I expected...",7,5 August 2009,"I heard about this film when it first came out a few years ago and gave it a wide berth. I seem to remember pretty negative reviews and the thought of the 'fun' Hollywood could have with the old culture-and-race-clash routine made me feel quite queasy. But, people, it's actually very, very good. OK, so the characters - Steve Martin's uptight white bread lawyer and Queen Latifah's wrongly-convicted-felon-from-the-hood - are drawn with very broad brush strokes. But thanks to the likability of the two leads, and a stellar supporting cast - stand up, Eugene Levy - it really works. Admittedly, I have a very broad sense of humour but there are several laugh-out-loud scenes, not least Steve Martin's wigga in the club routine and Joan Plowright's 'negro spiritual' at dinner scene. What I like about it most of all is that it's not afraid to tackle its racial stereotypes head on. Dyed-in-the-wool racists - and there are a good few in the film - don't suddenly convert by the end so there are no cheap feel-good scenes tacked on by the screenwriters to add bucks to the box office or a veneer of political correctness. Despite the stereotypes, the characters grow - for the most part - organically. Bringing down the House is what it is - a comedy verging on farce with no pretensions to anything greater - and it's not afraid to go for it. Watch and enjoy.",Bringing Down the House
159,KatRob9,Anti-White Propaganda,1,17 March 2006,"First of all I wouldn't spend a dime to see a Queen Latifah movie, but I happened to catch this on ABC the other night. I watched it for the purpose of seeing what Anti-White propaganda it contained because that's politically correct in this country, you can use terms such as White Trash, Trailer Trash, Euro Trash, etc., and nobody bats an eye. I was right, one of the lines in the film was Queen uttering, ""Sweep up this White trash."" I am sick and tired of it being open season on Whites while everyone else is a protected species and I am disgusted at Steve Martin for lending his name to this trash! This is the reason why I don't go to the theater, to see movies with either Anti-White or Anti-Christian themes? Screw Hollyweird!! I made note of the writer, director and producer of this film, so in addition to never going to another Steve Martin film, I will boycott all films by the writer, producer and director. Unless White people regain their testicles, this kind of propaganda will continue. Let's send the communists packing, where's Senator McCarthy when you need him?",Bringing Down the House
