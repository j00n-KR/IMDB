0,MartinHafer,more interesting than its predecessor but lacks respect for the franchise,3,1 July 2006,"Okay, it's true that I wasn't exactly fond of the original Superman movie. I still prefer the corny TV series starring George Reaves. But, although this movie is far more interesting than its predecessor, it is also a huge insult to the loyal fans.But first, what I liked and didn't like about the movie. I really liked General Zod and his crazed cohorts--they were far more interesting than the stupid Lex Luther from the original. They had style and looked like they should be adorning an S&M-themed float for a Gay Pride Parade. Also, it was nice to see the Man of Steel with worthy adversaries who really could beat him. However, here comes the bad. How could the writers and all those affiliated with the film allow Superman to give up his powers as well as have sex with Lois Lane?! This never would have happened up until the 1960s or 70s, as America had respect for its heroes. This ""anti-hero"" Superman is too human--reminding us that he isn't exactly the decent and flawless guy we all respected. Because of this, I don't recommend this film be seen by kids. In fact, because of the occasionally poor writing and sleazy elements in the film, I only recommend it be shown to farm animals.",Superman II
1,TheLittleSongbird,Inferior but worthy sequel,8,25 September 2010,"I love the original Superman film and consider it one of the all time great superhero films. This sequel is a worthy one. While it is uneven in tone, that I agree, and a tad overlong, the special effects are above decent and the score is superb. The dialogue is pretty good and this film is probably the best plotted of all the films put together, being not too serious and not as silly as the succeeding two. The pacing is secure, and the subplot is sweet and doesn't distract. The direction is good, and the acting is fine. Christopher Reeve is still likable, and Gene Hackman and Terrence Stamp are rock-solid in the roles of Lex Luthor and General Zod. Overall, it isn't as good as the first film but it is the first and I think only worthy sequel(the third being lacklustre despite some good moments and the fourth being awful). 8/10 Bethany Cox",Superman II
2,Leofwine_draca,Best of an overrated series,5,11 March 2011,"Having recently watched the original SUPERMAN for the first time and not particularly enjoyed it, I had no great expectations for its sequel. I'm glad of that, because SUPERMAN II is another film that hasn't dated very well over the years, and seems silly rather than spectacular when watched today. The bloated running time means that there's a lot of extraneous material and sitting around waiting for stuff to happen, and throwing in some lame comedy to fill up the running time doesn't help either. The special effects, while better than in the first film, still haven't aged too well.The good news is that this is better than the first one, and the reason lies in the villains. Oh, Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is back in this one, breaking out of jail for more of his scheming, but he's sidelined (and wasted) in favour of some far cheesier, more entertaining bad guys: three intergalactic warlords with a penchant for wreaking chaos. Watching these guys go around blowing stuff up while Terence Stamp deliciously chews the scenery is the best we've had yet. Of course, this all builds up to one of those massive, city-destroying brawls, a set-piece stand-off between Superman and his foes which doesn't disappoint. The climax is great, and acts as a template for pretty much every modern day superhero outing. If only they'd ended it here...",Superman II
3,SnoopyStyle,A good sequel to the original,7,23 March 2014,"It starts with General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) sentenced by the Kryptonian council to be imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) is sent to cover a terrorist threat to blow up the Eiffel Tower with a hydrogen bomb. Superman (Christopher Reeve) goes to save Lois and launches the bomb into space. The bomb explodes releasing the three criminals. Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) escapes from prison and discovers the Fortress of Solitude. Lois gets suspicious of Clark and discovers the truth.The start is just a little too hokey and a little too jokey. I don't know why anybody thought a honeymoon suite in Niagara Falls would be a good idea. With General Zod, it seems better to be more serious. Even if they can't be dark, the constant silliness really drains away the excitement factor. They even use Clifton James from the Bond movies as the sheriff.Luckily it moves off the silly stupidity. Terence Stamp puts a more serious bent to the movie. The movie dives into Superman's mortality and his responsibility. The battle with Zod in the streets of Metropolis is superb fun, and great effects work for the time. It is a good sequel to the first original modern comic book movie.",Superman II
4,Prismark10,Kneel before Zod,10,16 July 2019,"When Superman was being made by Richard Donner. Some of the cast did not realise that they were also making Superman II simultaneously. You would think they would had figured out that the production was going on for a long long time!There was chaos in production. Donner got fired and was replaced as the director by Richard Lester who bought a comic book look to the film. There were budgetary cuts so no more Marlon Brando for the sequel. Also Gene Hackman's stunt double seems to play a larger role in the film than the actor himself.Even after all that, Superman II is a terrific film. I watched this in the cinema as a kid and realized this was more fun than the first film. There was no need to establish an origin story, just head to the main plot.Superman II goes back to the beginning of the first Superman film. The sentencing of General Zod (Terence Stamp) and his associates Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and Non (Jack O'Halloran) by the Kryptonian high council who are imprisoned in the Phantom Zone and sent off to space.When some terrorists plan to explode a hydrogen bomb in the Eiffel Tower. Superman (Christopher Reeve) flies off to deal with the terrorists and save Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) who headed off to Paris to cover the story.Superman sends the bomb off to space, the shockwaves frees the three criminals who head to Earth. They have the same powers as Superman. Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) escapes from prison and discovers Superman's Fortress of Solitude and some of the secrets of the man of steel.When Zod causes chaos and destruction, Luthor seeks him out to make a deal. However Superman is nowhere to be seen.Lois Lane discovers the truth about Clark Kent's true identity on a trip to Niagara Falls and Kent decides to shed his powers for love.There are some wonderful action sequences accompanied by John William's iconic theme tune. The story might be corny, the special effects have aged but it works wonderfully here. Terence Stamp takes it all so pompously seriously and he has some great lines. As ever it Christopher Reeves who is the heart and soul of the film.Look out for theatrical knight Sir Antony Sher as the cheeky bellboy at the hotel in Niagara Falls as well as Richard Griffiths (Uncle Dursley in the Harry Potter films) as one of the French terrorists.",Superman II
5,classicsoncall,"""He actually cares for these Earth people.""",7,6 July 2012,"The movie may be over thirty years old, but I never knew it's history until I read some of the other reviews here this evening. There did seem to be a disconnect between the character of the three Kryptonian villains at the start of the picture and the way they ended up in their final showdown with the Man of Steel. For better or worse, I measure my super-hero flicks against the comic book icons that existed during my personal Golden Age when I was around ten years old in the early Sixties. So in that respect it was easy enough to identify with a Superman whose molecular density provided unlimited powers under a yellow sun.From an entertainment perspective this film was OK, though if you want to get nit-picky, that would be easy enough to do. Clark/Superman (Christopher Reeve) should have known that the gun Lois (Margot Kidder) used didn't fire a real bullet at him, and I wondered why she wouldn't have been committed for jumping out of a high rise window - how does one explain that? There was a clever gimmick I got a kick out of when Superman reversed General Zod's (Terence Stamp) heat vision with a mirror, and the advertising sign behind Zod said 'Cool It'.However if there was ever a film that shamelessly took advantage of high rolling commercial opportunities this was it. Marlboro and Coca-Cola were the most blatant examples, but you also got a glimpse of thrifty advertisers like Kentucky Fried Chicken as well. Usually product placement is done in a much more subtle way but here it was pretty much in your face.I guess what I'm saying is that it's not that easy for a director (or two) to interpret a character that will turn out satisfactory for every fan that ever grew up with a favorite super hero. As a sequel, this one doesn't quite measure up to the original made two years earlier but it has it's heroic moments, and manages to remind us how much Christopher Reeve is missed.",Superman II
6,gavin6942,"Son of Jor-El, Kneel Before Zod!",7,3 March 2006,"This film picks up where Superman part one left off. Lex Luthor escapes prison, Lois finds Superman's true identity (whcih she should have known right away), Lois also continues to be ugly and has a frog voice, and best of all - the three Kryptonians break out of the Phantom Zone.Say what you want about the plot, or the acting, or music, or how Richard Donner got shafted by Warner Brothers. None of this matters because this film has General Zod. His quotes and mannerisms are so quotable and awe-inspiring that even the worst film ever made would get an Oscar with his presence. Even ""Gigli"" would have gotten the Oscar with Zod, in his best role besides ""The Limey"".Don't ask why he speaks English or how he knows ""4 stars"" means a soldier is a general. We don't ask these questions. We just watch him walk on the water, command people to kneel, and comment about our worship of things that fly. ""General Zod does not take orders; he gives them!"" I mean, really, is there a better scene than Zod walking into a diner playing disco music full of hicks with Coors t-shirts on? Nope. Once you've seen this, you'll never reach this level of Superman fetishism again! For the love of Zod, recommended!",Superman II
7,jboothmillard,Superman II,6,3 March 2011,"It should be noted that Richard Donner (The Omen, Lethal Weapon) was the original director, but after being fired and replaced by director Richard Lester (A Hard Day's Night, Robin and Marian) most of his footage did not feature, apart from on the Director's Cut DVD released years later. Basically it picks up where the first film left off, where Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) was put in prison for attempting to destroy Metropolis, and we see reminders of what happened to Krypton and three criminals from the planet where the hero came from. Three human criminals have taken over the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and after saving the life of Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and exploding the hydrogen bomb in space, Superman aka Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) unintentionally releases the three alien criminals from their imprisonment. These three alien invaders, leader General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and Non (Jack O'Halloran) have the same powers as the Man of Steel, and slowly start learning about life on Earth before making any plans for take over. Meanwhile, Lois is in love with Superman, and vice versa, but of course as Clark he does his best to make sure she won't find out his true identity, but of course she starts suspecting and eventually does find out. Now knowing Clark is Superman, he makes the humongous decision, advised by his dead biological mother Lara (Susannah York, who tragically died a month or two before I saw this), to relinquish himself of all his powers to be with his true love. After spending the night with her, and getting into a fight where his human blood is exposed, Clark is not quite used to the life of a human being, but worse is to come. General Zod and his two minions have mastered their powers now and have started taking over place after place with destruction, and after escaping from prison, Lex Luthor may be trying to help them take over. They have found out that Superman is the son of their enemy from Krypton, Jor-El, and they are demanding him to show his face or see all humans on Earth destroyed. Initially it looks like Clark cannot gain his powers back, but he returns to the crystal fortress in the North Pole, but he finds the green crystal to get them back and go against the alien invaders. After being defeated in an earlier battle, Superman chases after the three villains all the way back to the fortress where Lois and Lex have been taken as well, and they force him to supposedly take away his powers again. In the end of course he tricks them and makes it so that they lose their powers instead, and he simply kills them like mortals, and he also reverses the mind of Lois so that she no longer knows Clark is Superman. Also starring Ned Beatty as Otis, Valerie Perrine as Eve Teschmacher, Jackie Cooper as Perry White, Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen, Clifton James as Sheriff and E.G. Marshall as The President. Reeve still packs a punch as Superman, but is also sympathetic being Clark and in love, Kidder is down graded in the cast ranks but still a big part, Hackman still makes a great power hungry criminal, and Stamp does do very well as the emotionless super powerful villain. The special effects are reasonable in parts, including of course the flying, but it can be unintentionally laughable, the story is not bad, but sometimes cheesy with dialogue, it feels like it's going back to the roots of being a comic book and not grown up like before, but never mind, it's a little overrated by the critics, but a good fun fantasy action adventure. Superman was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and he was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Good!",Superman II
8,Woodyanders,Worthy and enjoyable sequel,8,16 March 2021,"Superman (a fine and charming performance by Christopher Reeve) decides to give up his special powers and become a mere mortal so he can be with Lois Lane (the delightful Margot Kidder). Unfortunately, this coincides with the arrival of three criminals from Superman's home planet of Krypton led by the ruthless General Zod (robustly played with lip-smacking wicked relish by Terence Stamp) who have the same powers that Superman possesses.Director Richard Lester brings a welcome sense of broadly funny humor while maintaining a generally serious and reverential tone. Granted, Lester occasionally goes overboard with the silly slapstick gags, but compensates for this by giving the picture an impressively substantial feeling of scope and scale. Moreover, the more intimate scenes between Superman and Lois Lane are genuinely sweet and touching while the big confrontation between Superman and the evil trio on the streets of Metropolis delivers the extremely exciting and spectacular goods. Gene Hackman has a ball as the cunning and devious Lex Luther, Jack O'Halloran as dumb mute brute Non and especially Sarah Douglas as the lovely, yet lethal and merciless Ursa make for great secondary heavies, E.G. Marshall strikes just the right solemn note as the president, and Clifton James contributes an amusing turn as a redneck sheriff. Ken Thorne's rousing score hits the stirring spot. The sumptuous widescreen cinematography by Robert Paynter and Geoffrey Unsworth provides an appropriately dazzling look. The special effects for the most part hold up pretty well, too. A whole lot of fun.",Superman II
9,ccthemovieman-1,Best Of The Superman Series,8,31 October 2005,"This is the best of the Superman movies because of the three villains, played by Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran.Those three are so good, particularly Stamp, that they make this easily the most memorable of the four films. The scenes with them on the moon, their first encounter on earth and their climactic fight against Superman in the skies above Metropolis are all outstanding.Once again, Superman goes a little overboard in his romance to Lois Lane (do you believe some reviewers are upset there weren't explicit sex scenes in the film?) Hey, folks, it's just a comic book and it's supposed to be innocent, clean fun. Sorry that turns you off. For the rest of us, this is generally very enjoyable film from start to finish, with no real lulls.",Superman II

11,BA_Harrison,"Rather muddled, thanks to production problems, but still a lot of fun.",7,16 November 2007,"When I first saw Superman II, in 1980, I was an easily impressed 12-year-old who was too astounded by the on-screen spectacle and special effects to notice any problems with the film's story. However, having just re-watched the theatrical release (for the first time in years), I was amazed to see some glaringly obvious errors in continuity.After reading a few of the more in-depth comments about the film on IMDb, I am now aware that the originally released cut was something of a 'Frankenstein's monster': a mixture of footage shot by director Richard Donner and his eventual replacement, Richard Lester. But even despite its narrative glitchesthe unfortunate result of studio meddling it still manages to be a pretty fun superhero film.Christopher Reeve returns as the Man of Steelfaster than a speeding bullet and able to leap tall buildings in a single boundand, once again, he must save the Earth from danger, which this time comes in the form of three super-villains each possessing the same powers as himself. He also has to come to terms with the fact that, sometimes, being a superhero ain't that great: in order to spend his life with the woman he loves (Lois Lane, played by Margot Kidder), he must give up his powers.The action in this film is great: starting with an exciting set-piece atop the Eiffel tower and culminating in a terrific showdown between Superman and his three evil counterparts (played by Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran). Superman II provides more genuine excitement than half-a-dozen modern superhero films, proving that good ideas are far more important than jaw-dropping CGI.It is only when scenes from Donner's vision obviously jar with Lester's footage that the film stumbles: there are quite a few inconsistencies in the plot, and when things aren't explained very well (such as how Superman actually gets his powers back), I tend to get a bit antsy. A lot of viewers seem to have a big problem with Lester's more comedic approach; I don't mind this too much, as I find that it suits the comic-book style (I think a lot of films based on comics take themselves far too seriously).I am interested to see Donner's cut of the film, which has recently been released on DVD; the general consensus seems to be that it is the better version. Until then, I am content with the cut that I currently own. It's lightweight entertainment, and certainly a lot better than Superman Returns.",Superman II
12,moonspinner55,More is less...although audiences didn't mind,6,2 March 2021,"Superman tosses an elevator equipped with a terrorist's bomb out into the universe, where the explosion inadvertently releases the three criminals banished into the Phantom Zone by Superman's father at the beginning of the 1978 film. The trio comes to Earth to take over, partnering with an opportunistic Lex Luthor. Meanwhile, Lois Lane has figured out that her co-worker at the Daily Planet--clumsy, bespectacled Clark Kent--is really Superman; he comes clean and relinquishes his powers to romance her. Trouble on this production began with original director Richard Donner vowing not to work again with French producer Pierre Spengler. Then, Marlon Brando sued co-producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind for unpaid percentages from the predecessor and his likeness as Jor-El was removed from the sequel. Richard Lester stepped in as director, giving the film a more comedic feel than was really necessary (such as a wind-blowing sequence that goes on and on), but audiences at the time seemed to enjoy the changes. The principals--Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman--are worth-watching, as always, but the Kryptonian villains wear out their welcome fast. In fact, Terence Stamp as General Zod, Sarah Douglas Ursa and Jack O'Halloran as Non are good for about three scenes apiece. The film opened in several countries around Christmastime 1980 but didn't reach the US until June 1981. No Oscars this time, and one can see why: the picture has tacky color and iffy effects. **1/2 from ****",Superman II
13,sunwarrior13,Good Follow Up To Superman The Movie,9,24 October 2011,"Superman II is the sequel to Superman The Movie.It stars Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Terence Stamp, Ned Beatty, Sarah Douglas, Margot Kidder, and Jack O'Halloran. It was the only Superman film to be filmed by two directors. For this reason, the film is surrounded with controversy since original director Richard Donner had completed, by his estimation, roughly 75% of the movie in 1977 before being taken off the project and the remaining 25% completed by Richard Lester.In this movie,Superman is torn between giving up his super powers, confronting criminals from outer space, and having problems with his girlfriend,Lois Lane. When terrorists threaten to destroy Paris with a thermonuclear device as they hold reporter Lois Lane hostage, Superman comes to the rescue and flings the weapon into space. However, its blast outside the earth's orbit awakens Zod,Ursa, and Non,three villains from Superman's home planet of Krypton who were exiled to outer space for their crimes. Zod and his partners arrive on Earth and use their powers in a bid to take over the U.S., and then the world. However, when Lois realizes that mild mannered Clark Kent and Superman are actually the same person, he brings her to his Fortress of Solitude, where his decision to marry Lois costs him his remarkable strength. Thus the superhero faces a great conflict.The movie is a great follow-up to the first film considering that it retains all the delightful characteristics that the first movie has like adventure,tension,suspense and humor.Also,this one goes deeper into the love story between Superman and Lois Lane as well as the sacrifices each one is willing to go forward into their relationship.The performances were good from Reeve,Hackman,Kidder and the three Supervillains - who proved to be a great opponent to our Superhero. The reasons I am giving this one a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 unlike the first film is due to the fact that the other director,Richard Lester included numerous campy and comic relief moments.But nevertheless,the other 75% work of Richard Donner was great as the original.Also,it was evident that Marlon Brando is sorely missed in it as the Salkinds refused to pay him in the sequel.The relationship between Superman and his father Jor-el is missing theme in it. Too bad that Susannah York as Superman's mother Lara could not replace it.Finally,transferring the franchise into the hands of Lester from Donner proved disastrous as shown in Superman III.It was great that Superman II:Richard Donner's Cut was released 25 years later after this film to show what a great epic might have been if it was completed considering it was even a better film compared to this one despite being not completed.",Superman II

15,hitchcockthelegend,Fun packed and humanistic sequel is worthy alright.,7,9 August 2010,"Superman II stars Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Terence Stamp, Ned Beatty, Sarah Douglas, Margot Kidder, and Jack O'Halloran. It was to be a troubled shoot that saw two directors involved with the project. Richard Donner had completed about three quarters of the film before being taken off the project, so Richard Lester then came in to finish the film. Because of the back stage problems there are a host of writers credited on the film and both Robert Paynter & Geoffrey Unsworth were involved with the cinematography. Filmed using the Megasound system the score is a reworking of John Williams original score by Ken Thorne.Something of a miracle in itself that Superman II, in spite of all the behind the scenes shenanigans, is a very fine sequel to the massively successful Superman from 78. Sure there's some odd tonal shifts, a couple of things don't quite add up (to be corrected later on down the line with the release of the Richard Donner cut), while the villains are badly under written, but this has enough comic book adaptation savvy to please most comic book lovers.This time around sees Superman pitted against three villains who have been released from their prison due to Superman himself detonating a hydrogen bomb in space. The big kicker here being that the three convicts, General Zod, Ursa and Non, are from his home planet of Krypton and had been imprisoned by his father Jor-El. Now they are free they are hell bent on revenge against the son of Jor-El and the planet that worships him. If that was not enough for Superman to contend with, he also has affairs of the heart to deal with as his love for Lois Lane grows ever stronger by the day. While a certain Lex Luthor is plotting his escape from prison...Pic nicely fuses a humanistic heart with exciting set pieces, to make Superman II a worthy sequel to the wonderful template that is the first film. Ultimately we should embrace both cuts of Superman II or it would go downhill from here... 7/10",Superman II
16,Theo Robertson,Despite The Flaws It Has The Right Mix Of Humour And Action,8,2 December 2012,"It's somewhat surprising that this has a relatively low average rating of 6.7 at the IMDb . I say surprising because everyone I know who watched this on home video or caught it on its network television broadcast absolutely loved it . It's a film that mixes action , humour , romance and spectacle very well . It's also a sequel that I believe is better than the original which was overblown with the star cast overwhelming a threadbare story One point that I will concede is that the three plot threads of Lois and Kent , General Zod and his minions coming to Earth ,and Lex Luthor are somewhat jarring and for much of the running time you feel you're channel hopping between three different films . Much of this can be blamed for the production problems that plagued the film . Is it actually true that Hackman left of the production very early and most of his scenes are actually composed of stock footage , body doubles and sound alikes ? Congratulations to the production team if this is true The most important plot thread is of course General Zod and his colleagues taking over Earth and these scenes are the best part of the film . Some of the action scenes may seem a bit dated in comparison to super hero movies nowadays but this shouldn't be seen as much of a criticism . What makes these scenes work is the contrast between the drama and humour which makes for a watchable juxtaposition . Stamp and Hackman know they're starring in a international blockbuster and accordingly let their hair down . Compare this to the recent super hero movies where everything is po faced . Much of the humour here is consciously tongue in cheek and works all the better for it Overall this is a totally unpretentious crowd pleaser that doesn't take itself seriously . It was a production plagued by problems but with the exception of story structure this doesn't really come across on screen and even in 2012 this still remains the best superhero movie for people of a certain age",Superman II
17,preppy-3,Loved it as a teenager,9,25 March 2005,"Sequel to ""Superman"" is a rarity--it's better than the first film.Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) finally discovers that Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) is Superman. He loves her but to have sex with her (not said but implied) he must renounce all his powers. He loses them just as three villains from Krypton--General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and Nod (Jack O'Halloran)--escape from their prison and invade Earth...and Superman is powerless to stop them.I loved this in 1981--I must have seen it three times in the theatre. The special effects were (back then) state of the art and I found the action just terrific. Seeing it now over 20 years later I'm seeing difficulties I didn't see before.The special effects are really bad now but kind of amusing; the story ceases to make sense in several spots (it's established in the first film that Superman can't lie--but he has no problem doing it here and what DID happen to the three villains at the end?); the comic book level script and dialogue just got annoying (I was practically gagging at the love scenes between Supes and Lois) and what the hell was Luthor doing in this (not much)? Still I'm recommending it.Reeve is just perfect as Superman--he WAS the hero. He plays Clark Kent a little too whiny but as the Man of Steel he's totally believable. He was able to show off the innocence and kindness of Superman without making it seem silly. Kidder is just great as Lane--she now regrets doing the movie but she's very good here. Hackman (having a whale of a time) spices up his few scenes he has as Lex Luthor. And I really liked Douglas as Ursa--incredibly sexy and evil. Stamp got on my nerves--his overacting was overbearing and O'Halloran (who has NO lines) is just there. Also the sex angle was handled very tastefully--basically Superman can't have sex with Lois--he'd kill her. That's why he has to give away his powers. It's not addressed at all explicitly and the bedroom scene is actually very romantic.Some people complained about the violence in this film. Well. has anybody read a comic book lately? Comic books are violent too and all the violence here is non-bloody and VERY cartoonish. The only misstep is when they kill the three astronauts on the moon--why? And the rousing score pushes the movie right along.I recommend this very much--just turn off your mind, kick back and enjoy!",Superman II
18,zardoz-13,"""SUPERMAN 2"" Has Two Versions!",7,9 April 2014,"The versions of ""Superman 2"" are available. First, the theatrical cut of ""Superman 2"" runs 127 minutes and Richard Lester takes credit as the director. Second, the cut of the movie that original ""Superman"" director Richard Donner helmed, clocking in at 116 minutes is now available as ""the version you've never seen. Personally, I prefer the Donner cut, but ""Superman 2"" looks more like a brisk comedy with several outlandish dramatic moments. This is the Superman movie where savvy reporter Lois Lane cracks the mystery of Clark Kent never being around when Superman shows up to save the day. Superman finds himself pitted against more than just human villains in ""Superman 2."" As feats of heroism go, the Man of Tomorrow leads off by foiling an attempt to detonate a hydrogen bomb that terrorists have hidden in the Eiffel Tower. Naturally, he has to rescue Lois, who has concealed herself underneath the Eiffel Tower elevator. After he saves Lois, he flies into outer space with the hydrogen bomb and hurls it into the void where it explodes. What the Man of Steel has no way of knowing is that General Zod, Ursa, and Non, who were imprisoned in a phantom zone not long before Krypton blew up, are floating around in space. The hydrogen explosion releases the trio of villainous Kryptonians from confinement, and they fly to the Moon where they encounter an American-Russian space expedition. General Zod (Terence Stamp of ""Billy Budd"") comes to the realization that they are far stronger under a yellow sun and they head to Earth where they plan to confront the son of Jor-El. The tension here grows out of the Man of Steel tangling with three adversaries who have super power virtually identical to his. Meanwhile, the wily Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman of ""The French Connection"") has managed to escape from prison. This is one of the least believable scenes with the help of Miss Teschmacher. Apparently, Lex has patched up his relationship with her because she removed the Kryptonite necklace dangling around Superman's neck so he could foil Luthor's earthquake scheme to obtain the best real estate on the California coast in the original ""Superman."" The last half of ""Superman 2"" is like a wrestling match with General Zod, Ursa (Sarah Douglas of ""Conan the Destroyer"") and Non (Jack O'Halloran of ""Dragnet"") battling it out with the Man of Steel. Actually, this superhuman struggle boils down to a product placement smash up with the characters smashing up or crashing into signs or vehicles with trademark names like Coke, Marlboro, and Kentucky Fried Chicken on it. Incidentally, if you haven't seen the original ""Superman,"" all you have to do is watch the opening credits of the theatrical ""Superman 2,"" and you can see a montage of the entire film.",Superman II
19,Boba_Fett1138,An above average and entertaining sequel.,7,11 December 2005,"It's obvious that ""Superman II"" doesn't take itself very serious. This sequel to ""Superman"" has a campy look and story and some over-the-top, stereotypical villains. It makes this movie a very entertaining one to watch even though of course it at no time comes close to the brilliance of the first movie.Most of the movie was shot simultaneously along with ""Superman"", so that explains why almost all of the characters from the first movie are also in this one again. Would Gene Hackman had been in this movie otherwise? I don't think so, his character doesn't really serves a purpose in this movie and I think he would had kindly declined. I'm of course still glad he is still in this movie. Even though he doesn't really serves a purpose, he most certainly does make the movie extra entertaining and gives the movie some extra flair. This time the real main villains are being played by Terence Stamp, Jack O'Halloran and Sarah Douglas, the three persons who we saw being convicted in the beginning of the first movie. They have come to Earth to make some trouble and try to take the planet over in control (how original). The story is totally ridiculous and is really non-existent at times but it really is the fact that the movie doesn't take itself seriously, that saves this movie and makes it work as perfect entertainment. The movie has some typical slapstick comedy, which the first movie also had.Christopher Reeve is really great as Superman/Clark Kent and so is Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. Also in his element was respected and Oscar nominee actor Terence Stamp who played his villainous role intensively and with seemingly joy.The music is good and mainly consist out of the old John Williams musical score from the first movie. It isn't of course a terrible original way to score a movie but it works well for the movie and its sequences.I'm looking forward to the Richard Donner cut of ""Superman II"" and I have the feeling that that movie will be even better and more entertaining to watch.So this movie if you want to have a good time. It's perfect simple campy entertainment as long as you don't take it all too seriously.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Superman II
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The series gains more of a comic-book feel... for better or for worse,7,12 August 2006,"From what I've heard, the original director, Donner(who also directed the first) had a completely different vision of this. Odd, though, since it seems so much like the first. In any event... Lester came in and re-shot most of Donner's work on this, and the result is a much less epic piece of cinema. Most of the allusions to Christianity are gone. The cinematography now displays much more of a comic-book look... horizontal pans to simulate reading a comic book as well as framing altered to fit that. It has been said that Lester had no respect for the character... perhaps even a disdain. While that may be true, he does create a sequel that captures the root of it better than the original. The plot is fair. It picks up nicely from the first, with the three entrapped baddies from the opening of the first released... alive and killin'. The idea of Superman sacrificing his powers to marry Lois was interesting, though it could have been utilized better. I do like the development of the relationship between Lois and the title character... not to mention his somewhat clumsy alter-ego. The pacing is quite good... it seemed to work better than that of the first. After a title sequence that is so long that it should be a short movie in itself(much like that of the first, though this is less drab to sit through), which is inter-cut somewhat lazily with parts of the first(as a half-hearted attempt at a proper summary of it, I suppose... did people have an awful memory in the early eighties, not being able to remember a film that came out no more than two years before, and was re-watching it a complete impossibility at the time?), but once that is over, the film never really seems to lose momentum. The acting is fair, if a few of the performances are (perhaps deliberately, like much of the rest of the film?) overplayed. The humor remains silly, and is even slightly worse than that of the first. I missed the wit of Superman in this one. The villains remain moronic, though they do at least pose a reasonable threat. Some of the writing is downright awful. Characters' actions go unexplained. In one scene, civilians are threatened in a major battle, so what do they do? Run, as would be the sane and instinctive reaction? No, they cheer for their hero, ignoring the fact that they're in danger. That being said, I still enjoyed this overall at least as much as the first, and in some ways, possibly a little more. A pretty decent sequel, if you can live with the utter slaughter of most of what made the first film so popular. I recommend this to fans of the first and of superhero flicks in general, though I would urge anyone who loved the first to lower their expectations, or maybe even skip this altogether. I would imagine some might regret watching this. 7/10",Superman II
21,Uriah43,Better Than the Original Movie,7,21 August 2016,"The previous movie began with the introduction of 3 villains on Krypton by the names of ""General Zod"" (Terence Stamp), ""Ursa"" (Sarah Douglas) and ""Non"" (Jack O'Halloran) who were tried and imprisoned in a device known as the ""phantom zone"" and exiled into outer space. On a similar note, the film ended with another sinister villain named ""Lex Luthor"" (Gene Hackman) being cast into prison by ""Superman"" (Christopher Reeve) for trying to detonate two nuclear bombs in the United States. However, at the start of this movie Lex Luthor manages to escape and the subsequent detonation of a hydrogen bomb in outer space also frees the 3 criminals from Krypton. This results in Superman having to fight against all 4 villains at the same time-and he is not only outnumbered but has also lost all of his super powers as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this particular film was even better than the original. Of course, it should be noted that the first movie had the mundane task of setting up the characters and events which tended to slow the film down a bit. In any case, I enjoyed this film and have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Superman II
22,anaconda-40658,A Super Followup!,9,25 February 2016,"Superman 2 (1980): Dir: Richard Lester / Cast: Christopher Reeves, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas: Every bit as exciting as the first film. Clark Kent faces even greater challenges with his relationship with reporter Lois Lane and his battle against the scheming Lex Luthor and three super villains. However Kent may not be able to stop them thus leaving him torn between his love for Lane and his being a super hero. Directed by Richard Lester who previously helmed the Beatles masterpiece A Hard Day's Night. Christopher Reeves returns as Superman who questions his destiny. Margot Kidder plays the ever testing Lane who knows that something isn't quite right with Clark. Gene Hackman is superb as Luthor who breaks out of prison and recruits three super villains in belief that Superman has met his match. Terrence Stamp is compelling as the leader of the three super villains who are encased in glass sheet prisons hurled aimlessly through space but upon their escape they wreck havoc upon the earth. They embark upon a grueling battle with Superman in the city streets until Superman realizes that their downfall will not be through brawn. Sarah Douglas plays the sly and feisty female super villain. Electrifying special effects highlight as Clark must decide what is more important, being in love or being the man of steel.

23,AaronCapenBanner,Christopher Reeve Is Back.,7,25 August 2013,"Action-packed sequel to the original brings back most of the first cast, in how Superman must defeat three fellow Kryptonians, who have arrived on Earth after escaping their Phantom Zone prison that his father had put them in. Subplot involves Clark Kent trying to reveal his real identity to Lois Lane, whom he has fallen in love with, and considers sacrificing his powers for.Although great fun, and a worthy continuation of the first, this subplot about Superman becoming human feels wrong somehow, not to mention a bit sappy, but this is dealt with nicely by the slam-bang finale, and the ending really soars. Pity the quality didn't continue on...",Superman II
24,FlashCallahan,Crude noisemaker.....,9,27 February 2013,"A group of terrorists seize the Eiffel Tower and threaten Paris with a hydrogen bomb if the French government does not meet their demands. Superman immediately heads to Paris, where he launches the elevator carrying the bomb into outer space before it can detonate. Unfortunately, when the bomb explodes, it disintegrates the 'Phantom Zone', where 3 Kryptonian criminals had been imprisoned years before by Jor-El. Immediately, the 3 criminals, led by General Zod, head to Earth. Superman is unaware of their arrival, and is forced to sacrifice his powers for a life with Lois Lane. When he finds out about Zod and his companions, Superman returns to the Fortress of Solitude to regain his powers and confront the Kryptonian criminals.....Plot holes aside, and there are a hell of a lot, thanks to the behind the scenes goings on, this movie is the best of the franchise, and on a par with Nolans Batman movies.Yes, there is blatant slapstick humour, and Hackmans voice is dubbed worse than Seagal, but this is a very dark movie, Superman sacrificing his powers for love, and the ability to protect earth, is a hard decision, and despite the way it's handled in this, very quickly, it still is a ballsy move from the Man of Steel.Reeve still proves that he is the best choice to play a comic book hero in the world, and dominates the screen. But then you have Terence Stamp. His Zod is amazing, and Shannon will have a lot to live up to.Even though he goes a bit cockney in the White House, Stamp almost steals the whole film from Reeve.The battle in Metroplis is still an epic piece of film making, even thirty years later and despite the fact it all takes place on one street, and the final scene is brilliant.Hackman didn't need to be in this, albeit for the double cross scene, but hey ho, they had the footage, so why not.The Donner cut is a little better, but this still stands out as one of the best comic book movies ever made.In my opinion anyway.",Superman II
25,Aaron1375,Gene Hackman...movie bookend.,7,7 October 2002,"I liked this one better than the first one even though the first was better done for the most part.  The reason...Superman actually got to fight some villians.  In fact it was one of the best battles in a comic book movie between the hero and the supervillins for a long time.  Lord knows Batman never really had a great fight with any of his supervillins.  In fact until the fight between Blade and Deacon Frost this one was in a class by itself. Other parts of this movie though aren't so good.  The whole Louise finding out who Superman is was a bit overdone and to soon.  It didn't seem like much time had passed since the last one and already she was finding out. Christopher Reeve was once again a weak point except when he was outside the window and challenged General Zod to a fight.  And what was the point of Gene Hackman even being in this movie?  He gets top billing, but he is in the movie 35 to 40 minutes if that much.  He is there maybe 10 minutes at the beginning, then 20 or so minutes at the end with no real point for being there.  They also seem to ignore the fact Brando was even in the first one...I am guessing he didn't want anything to do with this one.  All in all the fight in Metropolis makes this one worth a look, but these Superman films always seem to have major flaws.",Superman II
26,Wuchakk,Continues the super-story of the groundbreaking first film,9,10 May 2021,"Three Kryptonian criminals escape imprisonment in the Phantom Zone (Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran) to harass citizens of the United States, including the president (E. G. Marshall), while Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) schmoozes them. Meanwhile Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) suspects that Clark Kent is Superman (Christopher Reeve) during an assignment to Niagara Falls before flying off to fight the Kryptonians. Susannah York plays Kal-El's mother while Jackie Cooper is on hand as Perry White.""Superman II"" (1980) was mostly shot simultaneously with the first film in 1977 wherein director Richard Donner had shot 75% of the film before focusing on finishing the first movie. When the flick went back into production in 1978 Donner was controversially fired and replaced with Richard Lester, who was already working on the project with Donner as second unit director. Marlon Brando's scenes as Jor-El were cut (obviously because he wanted too much money, i.e. 11.75% of gross US box office earnings) and redone with Lara (York).Despite the behind-the-scenes drama, this is a thoroughly entertaining sequel with some people even claiming it's better. What makes the film work so well is that (1) the three Kryptonian villains are interesting and their superhuman exploits are engaging, (2) Luthor is likewise amusing, (3) the sci-fi ambiance and special effects are state-of-the-art for the late 70s and (4) the drama involving Clark/Supes and Lois (and Perry White) is consistently entertaining. On the downside, I could do without Otis' goofy antics (Ned Beatty) and the movie is slightly overlong.The film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes and was shot in Paris; Norway; Niagara Falls & Calgary, Canada; Pinewood Studios (the Metropolis scenes, etc.), Chobham Common, Surrey (the East Houston, Idaho, scenes), & London Underground, England; and St Lucia.GRADE: A/A-",Superman II
27,zetes,"A mess - but it's almost saved by Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran as the three super-powered Kryptonian villains",6,28 August 2011,"Despite the seemingly neverending stream of comic book adaptation that we're getting nowadays, Richard Donner's 1978 adaptation of Superman remains the high point of the genre. Unfortunately, the sequels stumbled terribly. Donner got into some big arguments with the studio and ended up quitting. He was replaced by Richard Lester, who was forced to cobble together a final film using Donner's footage of Gene Hackman, who wouldn't come back to reshoot. Superman II is a pretty big mess. And the script is pretty lousy in general, so even if it weren't badly edited with a goofy Gene Hackman stand-in in several scenes, it wouldn't be very good. Margot Kidder's Lois Lane has become quite annoying in the sequel, somehow seeming dumber than she was in the first one even when seeing through Clark Kent's costume (when he loses his glasses, of course). Gene Hackman, when he is in the film, feels superfluous. Lex Luthor never makes much sense in the film, and it probably would have been better if they just left him in jail, as they do with Ned Beatty (as Hackman escapes via hot air balloon - for Christ's sake). Valerie Perrine, playing Luthor's girlfriend, simply vanishes from the film without explanation. The reason Lex Luthor feels superfluous is because his position as villain is usurped by far more powerful villains, three Kryptonian criminals who are accidentally released from their prison by Superman. Fortunately, these three villains, played by Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran, are awesome. They raise the quality of the movie by a huge amount, and whenever the film is concentrating on them, it's quite entertaining. There's some hilarious fish-out-of-water stuff, and they really are intimidating villains. I haven't yet mentioned Christopher Reeve. Well, he's fine. Superman/Clark Kent remains mostly unchanged from the first film. He was a delight there, and he's fun here, too. The film has a ridiculous amount of product placement, most disgustingly Marlboro cigarettes, whose logo appears all over the place in the film (one of the big action sequences of the final part of the film is centered around a Marlboro truck). The vast majority of the audience for this film are children and teenagers. Even for 1980, that's low. The producers who accepted that money, and, honestly Lester (or Donner, if those were his scenes), should be ashamed of themselves. My favorite product placement, though, is a box of Kentucky Fried Chicken on someone's dashboard - seriously, how much of a pig does one have to be to eat fried chicken while they're driving?",Superman II
28,Mr-Fusion,It works.,7,15 August 2013,"As Superman man movies go, ""Superman II"" is a worthy sequel, and definitely at the top of the list. But there's a silliness to this film that's always kept it just a step below the first (for me). The background players (those who aren't Supes, Lois, Luthor, White, or the Kryptonians) are all cartoons, played for comedy: the podunk sheriff, the people in the streets of Metropolis, etc. Thank god this never gets nearly as bad as ""Superman III"". Also, how does the red sun chamber work at erasing Superman's powers if he's just going to walk outside in the sunshine again?But the good outweighs the bad, and the movie kicks into high gear halfway in. There's a depth added when Lois discovers Clark's identity, and this is where things get interesting, what with the three bad guys taking over. Also, Terrence Stamp makes for a kickass ruling figure, and he's far and away the best villain in this movie (although Hackman's pretty funny when Luthor's sucking up to the higher authority). Mostly, this is a movie where the action is the best aspect. It's thrilling to see Clark revisit the diner for some righteous justice. And the ""Would you care to step outside"" is a badass Reeve moment and terrific way to kick off a rollicking good super fight. Nobody can play this role like Christopher Reeve.7/10",Superman II

30,StevePulaski,A worthy sequel in nearly every department,8,21 July 2013,"Superman II doesn't do a whole lot different from its predecessor, and to be honest, that's what I think I like the most about it. Often we see how far sequels can stray from their original material, sometimes getting cramped by ambition, strangled by not enough, or simply flounder because they just pail in comparison. Richard Donner's 1978 classic Superman was a fine film, nicely acted, very well shot, with great special effects to boot, and felt like it did justice to its title character. What more could you really ask for? Superman II brings much of the same material in terms of dialog, tone, pacing, and action, but has a different approach with its wit and focus. Director Richard Lester and the trio of writers - Mario Puzo, David Newman, and Leslie Newman - choose to make the film funnier, with more humor infused to the script. Just the first scene of the film, set in the offices of the ""Daily Planet"" newspaper with the boss talking to Clark Kent (whose role is reprised by the charming and drop-dead gorgeous Christopher Reeve) about how Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) is off in Paris, France covering a hostage situation. The scene is breezy, carefree fun, and evokes everything the Superman franchise has been about thus far.The villains this time around are General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran), all of whom are hellbent on enslaving the earth for personal good and so-on. There plan of action comes right in the same time Clark wants to spend time with Lois, taking their relationship on a more romantic, personal level. Lois still doesn't know Clark is Superman, the notorious caped-figure that flies around and rescues people all over Metropolis, but she has a good idea. She is so certain that she throws herself in the rushing currents of Niagara Falls to see if she'll drown first or will Superman come get her.Humor like this keeps the film afloat. Lester and the writers are sure never to let the plot go too far off in the cynical world of cinematic drudgery, but it also is cautious of how much humor it uses to the point where it doesn't become a laugh riot. If anything, the filmmakers' approach lightens the mood a little bit, while recognizing there needs to be a certain functionality of humor and seriousness to the material to make it effective on a grand-scale.If there's one thing to nit-pick, it's that the plastic qualities of the original film still remain in place. I mentioned in my review of the first film that even though Reeve seems to be clearly trying here, he still comes off as stiff and kind of bland. This could be because the scrupulous character of Superman is inherently pretty bland, and his moralistic nature makes for seldom conflict on the internal level. However, the conflict we get between Clark Kent's lifeless ordinariness and his larger-than-life persona begins to kick in to great effect here. The agony illustrated at least remains interesting and quite believable.Superman II is a fun sequel, to say the least. The change of directors is pleasant and most everything that made the first film a worthy triumph is back here with full force. Even as current superhero films flood the box office almost monthly, with their dark and somewhat brooding nature, it's nice to see a good, wholesome affair that isn't bogged down by dreary repetition because of tone.NOTE: I've been researching the production history of Superman II and have discovered there exists a version of the film titled Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, which is Richard Donner's version of the film reconstructed from the ground up. Donner was the original director of the 1978 sequel, until Lester came in and effectively took over the project. I will review the Donner cut in due time.Starring: Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran.

The story wasn't well written and the characters, I could just care less about them. I think most Superman fans would agree with me. I mean first off, Louis just taking off Clark's glasses for a minute and she recognizes Superman at last? Redicules, is it not? The acting was lame, just as bad as the ""villians"" who just tried too hard to be bad. May I say though they have an accurate portrayal of what America's president is really like. :D Just kidding!

32,DKosty123,Variety of Action- Otisburg Lost,6,8 July 2007,"This film features a variety of action because it combines two directors efforts into one film. Superman 2 shows where in its time getting liberal with sexual mores was accepted in American Society (before HIV became serious) & why the comedy was accelerated by Richard Lester.In the first film, Richard Donner's comedy was understated, & tung in check. ""Otis, take Supermna's cape,"" says Lex Luther & Otis snaps back with ""I don't think he wants me to take it, Mr. Luther."" While the first has a slower pace than this second one, it develops characters more.The second one is more action & quick joke like in the opening when Superman saves Lois on the Eiffel Tower. He catches her & then says ""I believe this is your floor,"" to Lois.Overall, this film has good action sequences & low brow comedy followed up by Superman giving up his virginity to Lois Lane. What is too bad is the opportunity missed here in that Lois could have had the decency to get pregnant & then have Super Boy & Super Girl. Then we could have three movies series instead of one. Where were the good Business Managers when we need them?Gene Hackman is very good in this film in a smaller but important role. The Eiffel Tower & Niagra Falls are used for back drops. The film is a bit UN-even due to the collision of the 2 directors. If Richard Donner had been used, it could have been better, no doubt.",Superman II
33,Red-Barracuda,A film that improves on the original,8,1 December 2010,"This surely remains one of the best superhero movies. Following on from the original film, this sequel is in my opinion an improvement. While the first instalment is certainly a good film, what it ultimately lacked was a good adversary for the Man of Steel to deal with. This situation was rectified here with the introduction of the trio of villains from Superman's home planet. They do appear to present a proper threat to the world and, therefore, give our hero a lot more to sink his teeth into. Not only this but in Superman II the character of Clark Kent is fleshed out a lot more and his relationship with Lois Lane developed considerably. This all adds yet another good dimension to the overall film.The story in a nutshell has three powerful super-villains from the Planet Krypton happen upon the Earth and seek to control it. Meanwhile Superman has relinquished his super-powers in order to become a mortal; such is his love for Lois Lane. He has to wrestle with this once the three villains begin wrecking havoc on North AmericaWhile the first film set the scene, the follow up just seems to have a lot more action and drama. Superman is challenged by interesting foes and gets to do a lot more. Not only does he get to battle the three central villains but there is a good scene earlier in the film where he deals with a terrorist assault on the Eiffel Tower and another good set-piece at Niagara Falls. Christopher Reeve is really perfect in the central role, with excellent support from Margot Kidder, Terence Stamp and Gene Hackman. Superman II is the best film in this series and remains one of the most enjoyable comic-book influenced films.",Superman II

I remembered watching this movie when I was a kid and was in awe to see the mighty Superman fighting three bad guys who also possesses superpowers. I sort of felt intimidated for Superman since he was battling people who matched his stature and strength, and remembered rooting for the superhero left and right. Like the first Superman movie, the special effects were sophisticated and fun to watch. Despite the movie being in 1980, the cinematography and effects look realistic and believable, nothing like some of the wash-out CGI effects we see in the more recent sci-fi/superhero movies. With plenty of action and a solid, dramatic story to boot, this is probably the best of the sequels in the original Superman series.Grade B+",Superman II
36,thesar-2,Those Terrible Terrorist,5,10 July 2009,"How the mighty have fallen. The original 'Superman II' (an unfortunate title, such as ""Coke Classic,"" we're forced to distinguish between the theatrical version and Donner's, uh, ""vision"") was such a downgrade to the 1978 classic. If it weren't for the wonderful performances of Stamp and Douglas, the movie would've been made a mess. I didn't mention in my review of part I, you really have to suspend your disbelief and have a total lack of reality or physics in both movies. Here, any laws are out the window. In fact, they simply give new, never before seen/heard of, powers to both Superman and his three villains. And what took Clark a lifetime to achieve, these three criminals learn in a heartbeat. Sure there's some comedic moments and it's neat (from a kid's POV) to see three bad guys with the same powers as Superman fight the Man of Steel. But the story simply sucks and it shows even more of a human side of the Last Son of Krypton to the point of absolute selfishness. I'm guessing the story picks up immediately after part I's finale, where Superman rescues Lois & all of Paris from a bomb, inadvertently releasing 3 baddies from ""The Phantom Zone"" and they quickly get bored with the ""easy"" conquer of Planet Houston (I love their (ha-alien) British accent: Hoooston) until the meet with Luthor who had easily broke out of prison and found Superman's fortress. All the while, Lois finally wakes up, realizing who Superman really is, and he decides to give up his flying duties for her. We all know she fell in love with the idea of Superman, and not the man.

37,Robert_duder,"A Superior Sequel, brilliant!! MY 300TH REVIEW!!",9,13 March 2006,"Here I am 300 reviews...an average of 20 films a month...honestly I do have a full time job. I just love films and I would like to sincerely thank everyone who reads me as a reviewer and all the input and emails I have received over the years. I do appreciate getting feedback and I love talking films. That being said I thought long and hard about what I was going to do the big 300th review on and I thought it only fair that I do the sequel to one of my favorite big screen adaptations and characters and the sequel to the film I reviewed for my 200th review.Superman II was the follow up to the original classic film that opened in 1978. It was only two years later but the origins of the story had come and gone with the original and the writers and director were likely faced with an even bigger challenge and that was creating an entirely new adventure for the man of steel. Smart move and fortunately for them that the original cast all returned, every single one of them. Although I think casting was not entirely perfect for this series it's still not good to replace character in the middle of a franchise when audiences have become comfortable with them. In many ways and opinions Superman II nearly or does exceed the greatness of the original. A True war raging between Kryptonians on Earth with super powers, the blossoming of one of the great romances in history, and a new and original story about an age old classic hero.Christopher Reeve returns to his role as Superman and Clark Kent. His emotions and very human side are much more explored in this sequel as he struggles with the decision to give up his super powers in exchange for the love of his life...Lois Lane. Reeve is still the absolutely perfect choice for this role. He still remains the man of steel. His powerful presence both as Superman and his bumbling, well maintained alter ego is perfect. Margot Kidder also returns as Lois Lane. She's never been my favorite choice for Lois Lane but as I re-watch these films my opinion of her performance grows and Superman II certainly helps that. She shows more of an emotional side, and we get to see her deep feeling for the Man Of Steel. She's still brash and forward and strong willed but definitely softens the image for the romance to take place. The real stars and stand out performances of the film are the villains who truly encompass the meaning of an adversary, arch nemesis or villain. General Zod played by Terence Stamp (who just for interesting facts now is the voice of Jor-El, Superman's Father on Smallville) plays the absolutely perfect Super Villain. He is downright insane with power and desperate to rule the world. He also perfectly portrays a Kryptonian completely unfamiliar with Earth and it's cultures. He's brutal and unforgiving and his battle with Superman is edge of your seat. His followers are the horribly cruel Ursa played by Sarah Douglas. As the only female villain in the film she holds her own against all the testosterone and perhaps has the cruelest look to her out of all of them. She also seems to be the one who holds her own the most against the Man of Steel. Finally Jack O'Halloran plays the silent and very deadly Non. His brute strength and lack of brains make him the perfect (and not campy) sidekick to Zod. Together the three of them are some of the best Film villains in history and their knock down battle across Metropolis is without a doubt a highlight in the Superman series. Also returning (although not with much fanfare, and apparently didn't actually return at all) is the wonderful Gene Hackman but never really so wonderful in the role of Lex Luthor. The writers always made Luthor more of a comedy break which doesn't make sense to me but the plus side to Superman II is that they eliminated the sidekick of Otis who was a complete joke to the entire original film. Apparently Hackman's role was created using look a-likes, stand ins and voice overs. If that is true they actually did a very good job and explains a lot of Luthor's toned down part. They did bring Ned Beatty as Otis back briefly for a cameo but left him behind in order to make a far more serious film which was a welcome change. Hackman's Luthor was much more tolerable and effective without all the bumbling and errors.Superman II went through many, many changes and problems and law suits and everything else. Brando who got top billing for his very brief cameo in the first film caused so many issues with the second that his already filmed parts were pulled altogether from the sequel. No loss in quality there because as great as Brando is his role as Jor-El is very small. Original director who was more than ready to film the sequel Richard Donner was replaced after filming a lot of scenes already. He was replaced with Richard Lester who I think still got a lot of help and ideas from Donner's original ideas for the film. However it was done it was done very well and turned out to be even better than the original. Still, for nowadays it might seem a little campy, and the acting isn't entirely on par but for what it was then and still today is the only big screen adaptation of The Man of Steel it's a great movie and a classic in it's own right.

38,Lejink,Super bad.,2,15 March 2011,"I'm a big DC comics fan and have read more than my share of Superman comics in my time, so I really wanted to like this sequel to the massively successful first Superman film, but unfortunately I found it turgidly slow, badly acted and even the action set-pieces clumsily staged and unconvincing. It really has dated very badly indeed, the blue-screen effects sequences in particular look embarrassingly false to modern eyes. There are lame attempts at humour like when the super villains alight on Hick-town USA or Lex Luthor's badinage with his stooge Ned Beatty, ditto emotion, the half-baked ""love-scenes"" between Superman and Lois and ditto even the mandatory genuflection towards American patriotism - Superman meets the President! Like I said the acting's more cardboard than a paper cup, the late Christopher Reeve terribly wooden, Margot Kidder's less than beautiful Lois Lane dressed in awful clothes and over-emoting every which way she can, Terence Stamp as General Zod, talking in his best fog-horn voice and completely failing to engage with the material and of course Gene Hackman confirming his mis-casting from the first film. Even the music is second- hand, derived almost note for note from John Williams' original score only underlining the staleness of the fare here.The only fun to be had here is counting the number of wigs on display - there are more than a few to be spotted.",Superman II
39,g-bodyl,"Looks Old, But Still Entertaining!",8,4 January 2014,"If there is one movie that hasn't aged well, that would be Superman 2. Not to say that it isn't a good movie, the special effects are rather bad especially for an 80's film. In today's day and age, this film has not aged well at all. But that being said, this is still a good superhero flick as well as a good, entertaining sequel. While it's inferior to 1978's Superman, this still provides a good time thanks to a good script, crafty direction, and very good acting.This film, set up after the events of the original film, has Superman losing his powers so he can live as a human with his love, Lois Lane. Meanwhile, the ever-scheming Lex Luthor joins forces with General Zod and his criminal pals to take over Earth and destroy Superman once and for all.The acting is definitely one of the highlights of the film. Christopher Reeve is very good in the lead role and has the right persona to play the alter ego. Gene Hackman is excellent and really funny. Margot Kidder plays a better Lois Lane than in the original film. Terence Stamp plays Zod with his freakish calm but overly powerful demeanor.Overall, this is a really entertaining sequel that actually brings back great memories of the original film. It's strange that a majority of the film was filmed for the original. Also, I noticed that this film is one of the most noticeable product placement films I have seen thanks to the huge ads of Coca-Cola and Marlboro. Despite some outdated special effects and a rather weakish look, this film is still a really good superhero film. I rate this film 8/10.",Superman II

42,callanvass,As good as you could possibly hope for in a sequel,8,8 January 2014,"Superman inadvertently lets one of Jor-El's major rivals go, Zardoz when Superman has to save Lois from a life threatening situation. A nuclear explosion commences, and Zardoz is subsequently free from his imprisonment. Meanwhile, not only does Lex Luthor escape from prison, Lois Lane finds out that Clark Kent's other alias is Superman. Superman agrees to give up his powers, so he can marry Lois, but with Lex Luthor joining forces with Zardoz and his cronies, Superman is powerlessThis is almost as good as the original. The story isn't quite as strong as the first one is, but it is a bigger spectacle with bigger action scenes, potent drama, and a poignant love story. The setup to let Zardoz loose is somewhat lazy, but effective nonetheless. I won't carp too much, because it worked, but I would have liked to see a more imaginative scenario play out. It also does what many superhero films tend to do after the first one. it stacks on the insurmountable odds for the superhero to overcome. It works in this movie, since it is done very proficiently. The visuals are a tad dated, and the middle section does become a tad tedious, with too many comedic sequences with Terrance Stamp (Zardoz) watching him abuse his power by destroying things, and causing chaos, became a tad redundant for me. What makes up for that is the riveting love story between Superman & Lois. What could have been a superficial love story is done with panache, and creativity. They take advantage of Superman's abilities, and do a lot of creative stuff with the love storyline. Subsequently, I thought making Superman powerless was a great idea. It made for some excellent drama. Christopher Reeves has more to play with this time around. He had a couple of good emotional scenes. This guy is Superman, and nobody else could have given the part justice like he could. Margot Kidder is even better than she was in the first movie. She had a couple of awkward moments in the first movie, but not in this one. She's much more comfortable, and it shows. Her chemistry with Reeves was on target. Gene Hackman is solid as Lex Luthor. He's not as big of a focus as he was in the first movie, but he still has a substantial role. Terrance Stamp is good for the most part in his stoic role as Zardoz. His act got a bit old in the middle section as I explained, but he played his part well. The annoying Clifton James (Aka, Pepper from a couple of James Bond films) is equally as annoying in this movie. His part was otiose. The finale is one of the most exciting things you'll ever see. The action scenes are often breathtaking, and it never lets up. After a bit of an inconsistent middle section, it ends things with a bang, including an emotional ending. Final Thoughts: If it wasn't for the middle section, this would be as good as the original was. That being said, I don't see how you could want anything more out of a sequel. It has almost everything. It is a must see. I loved it. 8.8/10",Superman II

45,slightlymad22,Super Sequel,9,22 December 2014,"Not a patch on the first movie, and I think that it's mainly down to Richard Lester replacing Richard Donner as director. Donner had completed (by his estimation) roughly 75% of the movie in 1977 before being fired and replaced with Richard Lester, who had been an uncredited producer on the first film. However, in order to receive full director's credit, Lester had to shoot up to 51% of the film, which included refilming several sequences originally filmed by Donner. According to statements made by Donner, roughly 25% of the theatrical cut of Superman II contains footage he shot, including all of Gene Hackman's scenes.Lester's approach was totally different to Donner's and he inserted a lot of slap stick humour, which is out of place and we get an awful lot of product placement with Marlboro cigarettes, Coca Cola and KFC all getting a lot of attention.Plot In A Paragraph: When she discovers who he is, Superman agrees to give up his powers so that he can be with Lois, unaware that three Kryptonian criminals he inadvertently released are taking over the Earth. Once again the acting is great all round, Terrance Stamp will always be the definitive General Zod, just as Christopher Reeve (again brilliant here) will always be the definitive Clark Kent/Superman. Gene Hackman is again a lot of fun as Lex Luthor. I really enjoyed Jackie Cooper as Perry White here, his first scene with Clark Kent was great.There are some great scenes with the battle in Metropolis and Supermans discussion with his mother about him giving up his powers being stand out scenes.I will end this review by saying this movie also contains the silliest line ever said in a movie ""They killed Superman!!

47,redryan64,"Like a finely honed and fitted piece to a Jig-Saw Puzzle, SUPERMAN II fits in and makes previous film even better!",10,19 June 2008,"SUCCESS of a film or lack there of is the main barometer in the decisions made by the ""suits"" pontificating in many a closed door meeting held in the Hollywood Studios. 'Art for Art's Sake' aside, the performance of a particular movie at the Box Office is the bottom line. Hence, we saw the old ""Thumbs Down"" to making sequels to some fine candidates as FLASH GORDON (Dino DiLaurientes/Universal Pictures, 1980) and THE PHANTOM (Boam Prod./Ladd Co./Village Roadshow Pics., 1996) and yet gave their blessings to something like the POLICE ACADEMY Series. EVEN with the imprimatur and full support from the Studio Moguls, there is no guarantee that the production would have any of the appeal of its precursor. In fact very rarely do any sequels come up to anywhere near to the success, popular $upport and public appeal of the original. For every BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, THE GODFATHER, PART II or ROCKY II there are at least a dozen the likes of JAWS II, SON OF KONG, DEATH WISH II and Mel Brooks' HISTORY OF THE WORLD, PART II. *AS for the old SUPERMAN Screen Franchise, the quality and integrity of the series got a shot in the arm with the release of SUPERMAN II (Alexander Salkind/Dovemead/Film Export/International Film Prod./Warner Brothers Pictures, 1980). The continuity and flavor of the first film, SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE (All those Companies & Warner Bros., 1978) is maintained and even improved.VERY cleverly and wisely, the foundation for the story line of SUPERMAN II is laid at the very beginning of the first movie. As we recall, while The Man of Steel's Father, Jor-el, is preoccupied with his scientific findings predicting the impending destruction of their home planet, Krypton; he is charged with the prosecution of 3 seditious Kryptonian renegades. THE Evil Trio, composed of the band of General Zod (Terrence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and the mute giant, Non (Jack O'Halloran)** is sentenced to an eternal imprisonment in the void of the bleak and bizarre dimension known as The Phantom Zone. (Not that same Phantom from the movie, Schultz.) Ergo, when the baby Kal-el arrives on Mother Earth, his family's sworn mortal enemies show up there, also. But whereas Superman's ""powers and abilities far beyond those of a mortal man"" are pledged to the good of mankind; the General and his accomplices have less honourable intentions. The story hits the ground running and never stops.OTHER elements from the previous outing include the cast; which survived the jump from one picture to the next, pretty much intact. We have: Kent/Superman (Christopher Reeve), Lois Lane (Margott Kidder), Superman's Mother, Lara (Sussanah York), Perry White (Jackie Cooper), Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure), Luthor (Gene Hackman), Miss Tessbacher (Valerie Perrine) and Otis (Ned Beatty)***GONE are the Kents, Jonathon & Martha (Glen Ford & Phyllis Thaxter), who have passed on and Jor-el and his duplicate life-force hologram (Mr. Marlon Brando).THE Film stands as a prime example of not only an excellent rendering of a movie adaptation of a Comic Strip/Book; but also of just what the quintessential sequel should accomplish. Being that the previous Superman outing concentrated on the Origin, coming out as a super-hero and his head-on meeting with the super evil genius scientist, Luthor; SUPERMAN II was able to continue and pursue the line about the 3 evil Kryptonians. The sequel fulfills the previous effort without skewing any of its impact or fun.IT also accomplishes the seemingly impossible task of complementing the first film; yet stands on its own. One would surely benefit from viewing SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE before seeing the sequel, SUPERMAN II; but it's neither mandatory nor necessary. NOTE: * That's correct! There was no HISTORY OF THE WORLS, PART II. The reason is self-explanatory to any one who ever saw it. (Definitely NOT Recommended!) It just goes to show what we were trying desperately to say! NOTE: ** This aspect of the 3 Evil Super-Renegades is adapted from a Superman story from an early 1950's issue of Action Comics, which was the first comic book magazine to feature Superman.NOTE *** We just have to mention Ned Beatty's characterization of 'Otis' from the first 2 Superman pictures. He did both a bang-up job in a comic relief role as the dim-witted henchman. He also gave us a sort of throw-back to the sort of characters (some crooks, some pals with the heroes) that were found in the old comic book stories of the 1940's and '50's.

48,zkonedog,Different Tone From Predecessor--But Still Mostly Works,9,11 March 2017,"After the original ""Superman"", it would be difficult to believe that any sequel could top the story, effects, and just the overall aura of that masterful film. ""Superman II"" comes close, to its credit, taking an entirely different tonal approach that probably shouldn't work but somehow does.For a very basic overview, this film focuses on two main arcs: Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) discovers the truth about Clark Kent's (Christopher reeve) secret identity as the Man of Steel. The two begin a more romantic relationship because of this, with Kal-El ultimately giving up his Kryptonian powers to be with her. Concurrently, the three Krypton villains last seen imprisoned in the Phantom Zone (in the beginning of part one) are released by a nuclear explosion. General Zod (Terrance Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) commence to wreak havoc on the world, with Superman no longer able to thwart them. As usual, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has a heavy hand in all the proceedings.What immediately stands out about this sequel is how different in tone it is from the original. Whereas Richard Donner's film is a mostly serious, bombastic superhero origin story, this Richard Lester (brought in when Donner had a following out with the project's financiers) effort features a much lighter tone filled with out-and-out comedy and sight gags. Oddly, though this change of tone should be jarring, it still manages to work--at least for the most part.A lot of the credit should go to the actors, who are all at their best here. Reeve and Kidder develop an even deeper chemistry, while the villains are unique and iconic enough to never seem truly ridiculous despite their odd machinations. Also helping the proceedings are the large-scale action sequences, which are always fun no matter how ridiculous certain events come to pass.Perhaps the hallmark of the entire experience is the exploration of the themes about Superman freely giving up his powers for love. Truth be told, this is a plot arc that should have probably been hit even harder, as it comprises the dramatic arc of the picture. It truly is an intriguing concept/dilemma, but here is played out pretty straight-forwardly.For many years, I considered ""Superman II"" to be the superior movie of the first two Reeve performances. After a recent re-watch, however, I've flip-flopped a bit on that. While it would be easy to say that the dramatic difference in tone is the issue, that isn't the case (at least for me). No, simply the down-playing of the main emotional themes and a lot of time (perhaps too much time) spent on showcasing the three villains now puts this one a tick below the iconic original.That being said, ""Superman II"" is still a solid follow-up to one of the greatest superhero origin films ever made. It plays very well for young viewers, does enough for adults, and introduces elements that would become iconic parts of the Superman canon. Despite the existence of a more serious ""Donner Cut"" of the film (using footage shot almost exclusively from that director before his departure), I've always (and still do) prefer this ""Lester Cut"". Though lacking the immense gravitas of the original, it also never fails to thoroughly entertain me.",Superman II
49,poe426,The Donner party...,1,30 March 2009,"Once upon a time, a group of settlers set out in a wagon train to stake a claim to some of the land taken (by force) from the Natives of this country. But Mother Nature stepped in and covered the land with snow before ""The Donner Party"" knew what hit them. Cold and hungry, the members of the wagon train began to turn on one another. One thing led to another, and before you knew it... Well, let's just say that, in the dog eat dog worlds of nation-taming and big-budget movie-making (which some might see as one and the same, in many respects), things don't always work out the way they ought to... When I queued up to see SUPERMAN DEUCE, the debacle that had been SUPERMAN-THE MOTIONLESS PICTURE was still foremost in my frontal lobe. Going in, I reasoned that there was no way this one was going to be as bad as the first: for one thing, the director this time around was the man who'd helmed one of my all-time favorite comedies, THE THREE MUSKETEERS. No more Dick Donner. The Party was over. Or so I thought. I shan't, at this late date, pretend to have eaten my words- but, boy, was I tempted! It was almost as if Donner's spectre was hovering over this one, haunting the massive soundstages and the thespians worrying over the lusterless script with the fingerprints of far too many cooks on it, reaching out its ectoplasmic hand to drop a timely monkey wrench into the works any time SUPERMAN TWO threatened to rise above its progenitor (which wouldn't have been very hard). But NO! This one was Lester's fault, from opening shot to closing credits. Unable by dint of his ""sheer film-making genius"" to lift this ""funny book character"" to Greater Heights, he instead dropped the ball (get in line, stupid). If Donner set the tone the first time around (and he did), Lester sounded the death knell. Going at it hammer and tong, they turned out not one but three Big Screen (BS) features that harked back to the second BATMAN movie serial (the unintentionally funny one that inspired the 1960s teleseries). Mario Puzo, whose outline for a novel (THE GODFATHER) became, de facto, the book itself, has to shoulder a great deal of the blame: he was clueless, and it shows. Nor did any of his co-defendants (sorry: collaborators) help matters any. The final irony had to be the release of SUPERMAN RETURNS, a remake in far, far too many ways of these bloated bombs. Siegel and Schuster must be spinning like tops...",Superman II
50,johnnyboyz,Sturdy sequel which lumps in enough of the crash and bang stuff on top of more substantial content.,6,15 July 2013,"I knew Terrance Stamp was too big an actor to be merely cast off into deep space like that. This is, of course, in reference to the conclusion of the opening segments of Richard Donner's first Superman film from 1978; the first of this franchise which launched the tale of a young boy attaining an anonymous God-like status on a planet many moons away upon being cast off from his own. But recall that it was Stamp's precarious scenario which began that film, a clad-in-black villain named General Zod who was on trial with two others and faced his own expulsion from a planet which exploded shortly thereafter anyway. Judging from the trio's pained reaction having been catapulted off and away, it may very well have been a fate worse than merely hanging around and experiencing the end of the world anyway.The sequence was, in a sense, one giant tease as creatures so evil and seemingly so powerful were introduced so dramatically and then exorcised from the film completely. None of the three from that opening featured again in the film, nor did this shining beacon of elderly wisdom whom seemed the only one matching them, in the Brando character, convicting them – but Superman II gives them their chance and boy does it have fun in doing it. It's with this, then, that Richard Lester's Superman II strikes us as a release - for the film's visual drama later revolves around what happens when these unsavoury characters garner control of their surroundings and are permitted to wreak havoc. The good and the bad come at once in equal measure in Superman II; a rare sequel which doesn't end up terrible and indeed comes off fairly well in its balancing of what made the first film work as well as trying to venture off upon fresh avenues. ""II"" doesn't have the inherent buzz of the first, where there was a freshness to people's introductions, problems and relationships. Nor does it have the dynamism of the first, where an alien outsider that's completely ill-at-ease with another planet's way of life tries to integrate; where the enemy was weaker than the hero, but had an intellectual 'jump' on them and were very funny on top of this anyway.Like Donner's first, Lester's film is too about extra-terrestrials arriving on Earth - but to attack and invade more-so integrate in what is a show of polar opposition to before. To this extent, the film rather crudely plays its hand when, nearer the end, a cry of ""this 'oughta be good!"" from that of a pedestrian tees up the several minutes of bashing and fighting as three unstoppable forces face off against an immovable object thus revealing its excitement at event getting these people in the same locale as one another. But the film's inherent imbalance (and therefore charm) arrives when we notice it is often B-movies that feed from this destructive premise involving aliens, and that Superman II is too good to be labelled a B-movie. British born director Lester is no stranger to making films about cultural icons; his films of fifteen years earlier in ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help!"" brought to the cinema screens the exploits and music of The Beatles. Here, he does well to maintain a lot of the good work Donner teed up in providing spectacle and entertainment on top of involving us in the core romance of the text and generally ticking off the range of different emotions audiences seem to want to feel when they fly through one of these comic book movies: joy, fear, hopelessness, laughter, sadness and catharsis.Set in the fictitious city of Metropolis, which Lester makes no attempt to fool you into thinking as he merrily shoots New York iconography, the film begins with Christopher Reeve's Clarke Kent returning to work at The Daily Planet newspaper following a holiday spent by himself reading poetry. Bumping into people and generally struggling with communication on top of coming across as a bit goofy, the only person with whom it appears he can truly bond is Lois Lane (Kidder), who just about finds the time to talk to him. Clarke loves Lois, but she herself states how they will only ever be friends. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is back, and we witness him engage in what might be the easiest prison break ever conducted by a person serving life; on the subject of breaking free from one's prison, the aforementioned Terrance Stamp and his three equally powerful, equally vicious cohorts have been released from their intergalactic traversing jail as they happen to pass by our solar system. Later on, the two parties will come to conspire as a unified threat during some genuinely amusing scenes of negotiation.In spite of the promise of action and spectacle, at its core is a romance between Kent and Lane; something which begins as lies and falsities during a Niagara Falls-set job as they work as investigators, before branching out into a procession of epiphanies feeding off exactly that: deception and alter-egos coming to the forefront. The romance is the best part of the film – the entry's peak: a strand with a subtle sex-before-marriage ethic that's peppered with ideas and messages about responsibility and sacrifice. In true James Cameron style, where action and spectacle take over once an on/off friendship/relationship has reached its crescendo via a sex scene or a striptease, the banished Kryptonians take over as the chief reason for anybody to do anything at all. This is not a bad film by any means; there is a genuine charm in the way it decides to mutate Kent and Lane's relationship while its scenes involving the invaders are suitably black as they are amusing. Its runtime goes quickly, its backed up by a pumping soundtrack dominated by a rousing theme tune and the whole thing generally comes off as something worthwhile.",Superman II
51,filipemanuelneto,"A miserable continuation that, understandably, has fallen by the wayside.",3,1 November 2021,"After the success of the first film, a sequel was predictable. However, I can't say it's as good or impressive as the first movie. In fact, if the first one seems old to me, this film looks even more dated and there is no doubt that it has fallen into complete oblivion. The script follows the story of the first film and reveals how Lois comes to know the identity of Clark Kent, with whom she begins to live a romance, despite the chaos that is caused by the arrival of three more Krypton inhabitants: the criminals who, soon at the beginning of the first movie, we have seen being thrown into space.The film is, on the whole, a poor sequel. I felt there was an effort to learn from mistakes and improve the story told, but I think Clark and Lois' romance is one of the less interesting points of the film, and that it may have displeased many comic book fans. For me, who enjoyed seeing the way he hid his identity and tried to court her at the same time, it was a bit annoying. One of the most notable improvements is the introduction of three truly menacing villains, capable of making the ""man of steel"" sweat a little, despite the maintenance of the despicable Lex Luthor and the tiresome and somewhat fetishistic mania that Zod, the leader of the villains, has to have people kneeling before him.Christopher Reeve remains an honorable and dignified Superman, even though he's not as fresh and committed as would be desirable. Also, Margot Kidder seems to be doing well and Gene Hackman, despite hardly showing up, takes advantage of the opportunities to try to do better than he did in the first film. Overall I liked the work of Terence Stamp, an actor who usually did not appear in big productions and is not so flashy and recognized, but has talent and ability. Even so, I felt that he overacts and sounds artificial many times.On a technical level, the film continues to focus on elaborate and eye-catching visual effects, following in the footsteps of the first film. It's not surprising, then, nor how cheap, primitive and unbelievable it is for our eyes, today. The cinematography seems to me slightly better than in the first film, as it is not so nebulous and makes a positive use of the filming locations and sets, which are more natural and elegant. It's a shorter than its predecessor, and that's another notable improvement. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is basically inherited from the initial movie, which is good.",Superman II
52,leplatypus,SuperOmanTIC (DVD),10,1 April 2007,"This second part in the Superman movies comes in straight line from the first one, but it begins also the drop of quality of the franchise.As commented in ""Superman I"" & ""Superman Returns"" (reviewed in IMDb), I saw this Superman not as a extraordinary human who happens to be in love, but rather the opposite as a common folk in a welcomed love story but who happens to have super powers In other words, Superman is a bonus to his private life and not a goal in his life.It is very clear in this sequel, because Superman only appears to save Lois Lane: in Paris, at Niagara Falls, As Lois finally discovers the truth, he accepts calmly to lose his powers. Without being stern, he lacks some sense of responsibility (""With great powers comes heavy responsibility !"" OK, Spiderman.).Finally, when he learns his duty (in a symbolic shoot when he brings back the American flag), it isn't explained by countries and people in chaos, but because he realized that Lois is totally torn by their special romance. As he cares for her, he ends their romance in an amnesiac kiss, so that he can become Superman at 100%. This part of the script is interesting because this moral dilemma is rather lacking in his colleagues (Batman,). This is something I completely missed when I saw it the first time.Except this, the enjoyment of the first movie has disappeared: Kidder, Reeve and Hackman delivers excellent moments but the Kryptonian villains have no charisma. Then, there isn't any emotional support from the soundtrack, the successor of John Williams bringing no new themes. The special effects look like cartoons.So if the story is good, the final product is rather a deception.

This sequel picks up tonally & narratively right where the first left off, only better capturing the childlike silliness yet warranted sincerity of the Superman mythos. Yes, the relationship arc between Clark & Lois is rushed, & the final fight is almost comically leisurely paced. But Niagara Falls is great, the moon is impressive, and the politics are wonderful.",Superman II
55,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Epic and exciting, a visual accomplishment for its time despite lack of focus",7,16 December 2008,"""Superman II"" is a direct continuation of the 1978 original, yet it is directed by Richard Lester, not Richard Donner, and there is the film's biggest point of contention. The controversial firing of Donner led to a film that while it doesn't have a distinctly different feel, certainly feels a bit shaky at points in terms of making sense. Otherwise, ""Superman II"" is still a pretty attention-capturing special effects and stunt-filled sequel.The film's villains are General Zod (Stamp) and his cohorts who after being imprisoned in the Phantom Zone by Jor-El, Superman's father, in the very beginning of the first installment, are released by a hydrogen bomb explosion in outer space thanks to Superman's heroic efforts at the beginning of this film. As Zod tries to take over the world, Superman grows closer to Lois, though his personally life will soon be sacrificed if the earth is to survive Zod.For 1980, the film's use of green screen is pretty effective though definitely obvious at points and the sweeping shots of Superman flying give the film an epic quality that combined with the John Williams score are pretty cinematically unbeatable. A large amount of explosions and actual car crashing stunts combined with the special effects powers of the Kryptonians in the film make it pretty action-intensive.What is most surprising is the script. Mario Puzo, famed writer of the ""The Godfather"" trilogy, in his last writing credit, makes the relationship of Lois and Superman really jump out. There is some real drama to be had there. Margot Kidder as Lois helps this along too. This movie is just as much about her character as it is Superman. The script really hits at the interesting concept of ""can Superman give up his powers for mortal love?""There were definitely a couple points during the movie where I had to ask myself if I'd missed a scene because something was off. The focal points seem to jump around and you really can't tell what's supposed to be important overall. Lois and Superman on their own is a great story, but it gets lost in the Zod taking over the world plot. And Lex Luthor (Hackman), while a great personality and name, certainly doesn't need to be there.",Superman II

57,imseeg,"Silly, outdated special effects. Childish unbelievable story. BUT this movie still has got it's charms. It was THE super hero movie of the eighties: the one and only Superman!",7,1 November 2019,"I feel like a kid again watching this again when I am an adult, but I dont know for sure if anyone below 30 years of age could still like this movie, because of it's silly outdated special effects, it's mediocre supporting actors and because of it's childish story. It really is targetted towards kids, but adults loved it as well back in the eighties. It was the only real superhero movie of the eighties and it was a huge worldwide hit back then. I still love it for sentimental reasons, but it truly has got something really charming and glorious at it's core, that is undeniably still very enjoyable!I have moments of embarrassment though at certain scenes that are so terribly silly and childish, BUT overall this movie still has got incredible charm. And that's all thanks to a great basic story of Superman protecting the woman he secretly loves. It's basically a romantic comedy with lots of super hero action scenes in which Superman (in his spare time) protects the entire earth from harm. That's a ridiculous, but still an incredibly charming dreamlike story. And what a great glorious soundtrack by John Williams!I wanna applaud Cristopher Reeves for his acting performance. As an actor he wasnt taken seriously in the beginning of the eighties, but this man truly has got the comic touch and can act truly great as well. Unfortunately he is now in a wheelchair, totally paralysed from neck till his feet, after he fell from a horse. And he has been leading this vegetative existence for many years now, but his spirits and wit is still standing strong. What a tragedy. What a great guy!",Superman II
58,gwnightscream,Good Sequel!,7,29 February 2012,"Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran star in this 1980 action sequel. This takes place shortly after the events of the original with Superman (Reeve) accidentally releasing 3 Kryptonian criminals, General Zod (Stamp), Ursa (Douglas) and Non (O'Halloran) from the Phantom Zone who naturally head for Earth. Soon, Clark travels with Lois Lane (Kidder) to Niagra Falls for a newspaper assignment and she discovers he's Superman. Since he loves her, he decides to give up his superpowers for her. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Hackman) escapes from prison and teams up with the 3 criminals. While out with Lois, Clark learns there's consequences of being human and that the 3 criminals are destroying the country. He realizes he must try to get his powers back and stop them.

59,FiendishDramaturgy,Even better than the original!!,9,24 October 2003,"Another box office smash hit by Salkind! Reeve is the shining star as Superman in this above-average sequel. Although great in the first installment, his performance far outshines that of the original Superman production. I remember seeing this movie in the theaters with my mom. She was the avid movie- and sci/fi lover in my family and thankfully passed her passions on to me. Before seeing this production, we found a theater which played nothing but retro movies and took in a shared viewing of the original ""Superman."" Black and white and hokey as all get-out. Superman was some bald guy with bad teeth and a beer-gut hanging over his tights. Being forced to view that movie did one sure thing; it made me view Christopher Reeve and the wonderful effects, story and sets in these newer productions with a far greater appreciation.This time, the three who are banished from Krypton in the original, are loose and terrorizing the city of Metropolis while Superman has shelved his cape in exchange for a love interest with Lois Lane. Of course, he has no idea what is happening to his beloved city, and the Daily Planet and when he does get wind of it, he does what a hero has to do.All in all, a very entertaining, enjoyable, lovable (if sometimes unevenly alternating between melancholy and campy) movie.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",Superman II

Despite these issues, I prefered the sequel more than the original.Superman: The Movie was considered the serious, epic take on the character but I found it to be a cheesy film for the most part. Superman II was similar and it had one big advantage: General Zod and his followers. They actually felt like a threat that could beat Superman. The heart of the film was the relationship between Clark/Superman and Lois with Clark willing to sacrifice his powers for her.It was an epic moment when Superman returns with that classic fanfare and fight the baddies in Metropolis. Zod used Superman's care for humanity against him, Something Man of Steel should have done was show Superman trying to save civilians.",Superman II
61,dee.reid,If there was a greater sequel...,10,3 October 2006,"(I just couldn't wait for the director's cut, so anything I say here might soon be outdated.)""Superman II,"" directed in 1980 by Richard Lester, is probably the best sequel of the first wave of superhero movies. ""Superman II"" is big, goofy fun, with a sense of action, romance, and humor that wouldn't quite be seen again in the genre until last year's ""Fantastic Four."" ""Superman II"" is one of the great sequels, despite its sloppy editing and a controversial back-story worthy of a movie of its own.We know that ""Superman"" (1978) director, Richard Donner, was originally supposed to direct the sequel but was fired under highly suspicious and (to this day) unknown circumstances following a dispute with that film's producers, the Salkinds. Supposedly, it began with issues over creative direction. Compounding that, Donner had gone over the originally planned budget for ""Superman,"" and the Salkinds had been rushing the poor man to complete the film. Conversely, Marlon Brando (Jor-El in ""Superman""), didn't want to be in the second movie and filed suit over his percentage of that film's earnings. Simultaneously, Donner had also been shooting footage for ""Superman II"" and had completed somewhere around 75% of it between 1976-1978 before he was fired. But of course, the lore is well-known to those who pay attention to this film's history, and what I just described were probably the biggest reasons for Donner's removal.Lester was brought in after Donner, scrapped most of Donner's footage, and replaced it with his own material that was filmed between '79-'80 (to the untrained eye, the different footage appears seamless but to those aware of ""Superman II's"" history, it'll be a lot like a shooting gallery for continuity errors). Only about 25% of the original scenes Donner filmed are in the movie we know today, with jarring transitions between scenes since nearly three years had passed between the two directors' filming of scenes. This all caused a near-mutinous insurrection on the set, and many of the actors (Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve - R.I.P., Margot Kidder, and Terence Stamp) were quite vocal about this; Hackman refused to appear in any of Lester's new scenes and it's easy to tell when a body double is being used.Original composer John Williams also walked away from the project following Donner's removal, and was replaced by Ken Thorne, who takes material from Williams's score and merely covers it with his own in much the same way Lester did with Donner. Lastly, cinematographer Robert Paynter gave a comic book look to the film that conflicted with the sparkling, epic cinematography of the late Geoffrey Unsworth. What we get, to paraphrase another viewer, is ""sloppy seconds,"" but still an enjoyable and moving experience in its right. ""Superman II"" still made a box office killing in 1981, so it couldn't have been that bad (?). (Hopefully, this will all be cured by the new Richard Donner cut that's due out on Nov. 28 later this year, which should include more of Donner's original material, more Hackman footage, Marlon Brando, more violence and story dealing with the three Krypton villains' task on Earth, more scenes with Reeve and Kidder, completed special effects, a new opening and ending - ?, and Lester footage to fill in the gaps.)In ""Superman II,"" the Man of Steel, as Clark Kent (Reeve), is getting serious with Lois Lane (Kidder), and considers giving up being Superman. If he were to do this, however, he will become a normal human being, with no way to restore his powers, and no way to stand up to a diner's bullying customer. This romantic infatuation probably could not have come at a worse time because a nuclear explosion in outer space shatters the Phantom Zone, the eternal prison of three outcasts from Superman's home planet Krypton. The blast frees the traitorous head of Krypton's military forces, General Zod (Stamp), the man-hating Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and the brutish Non (Jack O'Halloran), who then make a bee-line for Earth in a bid for world domination. Once on Earth, they discover they have all of Superman's powers, and then some. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Hackman) manages to escape from prison (with help from Miss Teschmacher, played by Valerie Perrine), leaving a hapless Otis (Ned Beatty) behind, and sets out on a quest to the North Pole to find the Fortress of Solitude using a device he constructed while incarcerated.What this all climaxes in, is an action-packed (if not somewhat slapstick) special effects bonanza that takes place in the skies over Metropolis, with Superman and the three Krypton villains going head to head. It's really exciting stuff to see Superman grappling with the new experience of fighting three adversaries of his power level.Is ""Superman II"" a failure? Yes, because it betrays what was originally laid out by a great director and is probably one of the great, early examples of Hollywood ""chopping & screwing."" ""Superman II"" is still highly regarded as a cult classic, and director Sam Raimi makes a few nods with ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004). I can see that DC Comics is making a comeback; if original Superman co-creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster could see these films, I bet they'd be proud.P.S.: R.I.P. - Marlon Brando10/10",Superman II
62,MaxBorg89,A perfect companion piece to the first film.,10,20 July 2006,"In 1978, Richard Donner's Superman made us believe a man could fly. in 1980 the sequel, partly directed by Donner (he was sacked and replaced by Richard Lester, who received the sole directing credit) managed to do it again, and better.Fans of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies may find similarities between Superman II and the second Spidey flick: this new installment sees our hero (Christopher Reeve) give up his powers (sound familiar?) so that he can spend the rest of his life with the beloved Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), who has accidentally discovered his identity. Unfortunately, his happiness won't last, as the world faces new danger: Kryptonian criminal General Zod (Terence Stamp) and his sidekicks (Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran), who were imprisoned in the Phantom Zone at the beginning of the first movie, are suddenly free and decide to conquer Earth. On top of that, they find an ally in Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), recently escaped from jail. Looks like Supes picked the wrong week to quit his job...Like its predecessor, Superman II works because the filmmakers focus on the contrast between his body and his heart: one's indestructible, the other is not, and that's why he's a believable, likable character (no wonder Bryan Singer based his Superman Returns on the first two S-movies). The contrast is made even stronger by the fact that this time he must choose between a normal life and what he vowed to do with his abilities.Those looking for jaw-dropping action shouldn't worry either: the scenes where Superman fights his three opponents (with the same powers as he) in the middle of Metropolis are still as awesome as they were 26 years ago, a true joy for the eye.And as usual, the acting is top notch: Reeve gives Superman that special mix of strength and vulnerability that make him unique, while the ruthless yet calculating Stamp and the hilarious Hackman form a perfect villain duo.So, wanna see a superhero film with something special?

At the same time Superman has fallen in love with Lois and is learning to be equal/human with her, he must give up his Superman powers. Will he sacrifice so much to be with Lois? How will the villains be stopped if he doesn't have his powers? How will Lex Luthor jockey the villain hierarchy? Those are the core tension plot points. The three villains are great.

There is a little bit of Satan and the fallen angels about General Zod and his sidekicks. Lex Luthor has a more peripheral role which works well with the dynamic of the other three.An important part of Superman II is Superman's relationship with Lois and this is done very well, with an almost biblical feel of temptation, which continues the Christ-like arc from the original movie. My only issue is that it is one relationship you could never want to succeed given what he has to sacrifice for it to happen.There is some nice humour, especially from the villains and the reactions of the bystanders to the fight scenes.The visuals have dated when you compare to modern superhero movies, but they were all rather spectacular in their day. I especially enjoyed the showdown at the Fortress Of Solitude.All performances are excellent, particularly Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman and Terrence Stamp.

65,barnabyrudge,"Entertaining sequel, with a busy plot and enthusiastic performances.",7,26 November 2006,"The original Superman movie took quite a while to get going, but Superman II dives straight into the action. Also, where part one had a degree of seriousness, this sequel plants its tongue very much in its cheek. Many of the original cast members are back, which helps to bring a sense of continuity to the film, but most crucially Superman II brings back the three leather-clad villains from Krypton played by Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran (you may remember from the original film that they were exiled by Superman's father, Jor-El).In Paris, a gang of terrorists seize the Eiffel Tower and threaten to detonate a nuclear bomb. Ace reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) sneaks into the tower hoping for a major news scoop, but one of the terrorists accidentally  and irreversibly  sets the bomb's timer ticking. Just in the nick of time, Superman (Christopher Reeve) flies in to save the day. With seconds remaining he carries the nuclear bomb into space, where it explodes harmlessly outside the Earth's atmosphere. The explosion is not quite as harmless as Superman thinks, though. for at that very moment, a glass mirror drifts by, imprisoned in which are three super-villains from Superman's home planet of Krypton. Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and Non (Jack O'Halloran) have been floating around in space since Superman's father, Jor-El, banished them from Krypton years before! Meanwhile, back on earth Superman's old adversary Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) escapes from jail and sets off in search of information about the Man Of Steel so that he might find a way to defeat him. Luthor discovers Superman's Arctic ice palace, where all the teachings and background history about Superman are stored. Soon, Zod, Ursa and Non arrive on Earth and use their super-powers to wreak havoc and destruction on a grand scale. Luthor teams up with them, and offers to tell them what he knows about Superman and his ancestry. And Superman's problems don't end there for his girl-friend Lois begins to slowly figure out that his alter ego is the nerdy news reporter Clark Kent  with whom she works!!! Superman II is certainly a busy film, with plots and subplots galore, but thanks to skillful story-telling it never becomes cluttered or confusing. Reeve is excellent once again as Superman/Clark Kent. He is especially good during a sequence where he confesses everything to Lois Lane and relinquishes his super-powers in order to be with her. Hackman seems to be having great fun as Luthor  in one hilarious scene, he bargains with the trio of Krypton villains, promising them they can rule the whole world as long as they give him Australia for his contribution towards Superman's downfall!! The special effects are well done for a 1980 film, with certain improvements made since the first Superman film (which was released two years earlier). During the big street battle between Superman and his three super-human opponents, the destruction of buildings, vehicles and roads is convincingly staged. And the flying sequences, while still not totally perfect, look a little more believable than they did in the earlier film. Superman II might well be 2-hours plus of juvenile, comic-strip shenanigans, but it's good fun!",Superman II

In this episode, Lex Luthor is not near as menacing as a threesome jailed by Superman's father and finds themselves on Earth to take revenge upon Superman and takes it out on the good old USA as well.  The special effects are not top-notch if you compare them to today's standards, but the movie works because we know it is based on a comic-strip character(this is not supposed to be real, people).  This is similar to the impact of other comic book movies like Popeye and Flash Gordon, where the filmmakers don't try to make everything seem real because it's not.

It is certainly still fun to root for the man in the blue suit as he fights off the threat of total world tyranny, but really the opening Eiffel Tower sequence is as good as this pic gets.Great to see all the old familiar faces back, especially villainous Gene Hackman; though he's never as good as he was in number one.

68,aimless-46,It Seemed much better in 1980,6,21 March 2007,"""Superman II"" (1980) suffers from the curse of most special effects loaded films from 25-30 years ago; the stuff you loved the most at the time of the theatrical release now looks lame and silly. Not so much because you are jaded, you are happy to cut a lot of slack for the hokey sci-fi stuff from the 50's and 60's, it's just that this transitional stuff leaves you wishing that they had waited a few years before cranking this out. To me the Donner cut vs the Lester release issue is irrelevant because ""Superman II"" was never about the script, the acting, or the editing. It was all about production design and effects. In those two areas it was a super-ambitious effort, which paid off with 1980 audiences and critics. While it's a shame that Donner's vision was not the one released to theaters, today's viewers should prefer the Lester release simply because its greater emphasis on parody elements make it a much better fit with the dated production design and effects. That said, there are some script issues that made no more sense in 1980 than they do today. The three Krypton outlaws (Terrance Stamp, Jack O'Halloran, and Sarah Douglas are still the film's most compelling element) have acquired some weird ability to levitate objects that I don't recall ever being part of the Superman's abilities. This is unnecessary and simply calls attention to screenwriter Mario Puzo's ignorance or indifference to tradition (insert disrespect here). He compounds this with a totally unconvincing Lois Lane-Superman romance more serious than the combined 60 years of comic book teasing on the subject. Finally, it is presumed that on Krypton no one had super-powers, yet within hours of acquiring these abilities the three outlaws appear baffled that everyone in the universe does not share their abilities. Acting-wise only the villains look to be having any fun with this thing, and it could use more of Ned Beatty. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Superman II

70,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A worthy sequel with a couple slip-ups,8,27 July 2014,"When Superman (1978) arrived in theaters Christopher Reeve had become one of the biggest names around. With his portrayal of the iconic American hero and all around good guy Clark Kent / Superman, Reeve had solidified that he was in fact the original Superman (even though there were portrayals before him). Two years later fans received a delightful second entry in the life of the man of steel. For this particular installment, there are a number of additions to the original story that was told in 1978. Much of it greatly increases the depth of the main leads but there are also a couple of errors that weren't addressed.Viewers begin the story with the reintroduction of General Zod (Terence Stamp) and his cronies being banished to the phantom zone. Then skip ahead to current time where Superman is doing his usual business of saving people and accidentally releases Zod and his buddies from the phantom zone. However, Kent doesn't know this. Instead, as the Zod crew begin wreaking havoc on Earth, Kent is too busy being caught up on Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Among all this though, Kent as an individual goes through quite a character arc thanks to the three writers behind the screenplay. One of which worked on two of the Godfather films and the other wrote for Bonnie and Clyde (1967).The best subplot to the writing is the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Over time Lois begins realizing the patterns at which Superman appears, making her suspicious of coworker Clark. This happens gradually and finally when it hits, it's very sudden. Perhaps too quickly, but by that point viewers will be too invested into what is going on, that it won't matter. This is a pivotal point because it tests Clark to see how well he can be as himself. Unfortunately, with this rich character development comes flimsy loophole endings that are not expanded upon. There are certain things in movies that shouldn't go assumed. Not every audience member may understand, which would have them looking other places for answers. If something is going to be done for a reason, there should be an explanation behind it. Other than this particular issue, there really isn't much to see that's wrong. Even though the director had changed due to friction, the playout feels very much like the last film. The tone did not change and neither did the characters. Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Jackie Cooper, Gene Hackman all play their roles like they had never left the set. Terence Stamp as Zod and his followers also give likable performances, even for villains. What Stamp does that makes Zod so interesting is how he speaks; it sounds so pompous. Zod's henchman are cool too. Ursa being quite a powerful woman and Non just for being brute muscle every time and any time he's on screen.The practical effects are consistent and continue to be effective. Along with that are the action sequences that increase in damage and uniqueness. Surprisingly even the style of cinematography was changed. Robert Paynter took over. Although it was executed differently, the shots and overall image still look grand and beautiful. Perhaps the most astonishing is that John Williams did not return to compose. Yet, Ken Thorne (who just past away this year) the replacement composer, did a respectable job filling in. Thorne maintained the Superman theme and continued the upbeat feel of the tracks. Well done.The development in its characters is done exceptionally. Sadly the buildup is so good that its justification for various actions feel flimsy, like that of its predecessor's finale. Other than that, it is worthy of a superman sequel from its production design, music special effects and cast.",Superman II

Terence Stamp clearly relishes his role as the ruthless, yet (mostly) calm and collected General Zod, who, with his two cohorts, were banished from Krypton shortly before its destruction in the early stages of the first film. Freed by shock waves from a blast in deep space, the trio head to Earth to wreak havoc, and gain control of the entire planet. Meanwhile, a love story between Superman and Lois Lane is playing out.

When the Richard Donner version comes I hope this edition doesn't disappear. Yes there are major loop holes in this movie however Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Jackie Cooper all do a great job! This movie is still lots of fun and holds up on repeated viewing. Can you say the same thing about ""Batman"", ""Batman Returns"", and so on? I like the Paris Footage. I like the Niagra Falls footage. I love this movie. Not a perfect movie but it is an enjoyable movie.

73,brando647,A Solid Second Adventure for the Man of Steel,8,31 May 2013,"And now the epic conclusion to the story introduced in the opening sequence of Richard Donner's SUPERMAN in 1978. Well, I suppose it actually depends on which version you see. One version definitely rolls a little smoother than the other. For those that aren't aware, there are two versions of SUPERMAN II: the Richard Lester version released in U.S. theaters in 1981 and the Richard Donner re-cut version released on home video in 2006. Regardless of which version you've seen, they both follow the same basic premise as a direct sequel to SUPERMAN. In the first film, we see Jor-El and a council on Krypton addressing three criminals who have attempted treason against their government before sentencing them to the Phantom Zone. These criminals, under the command of General Zod, are later released in the vicinity of Earth, where they arrive with intention of dominating our species. As a bonus, Zod sees an opportunity to gain revenge against the son of the man who condemned himKal-El, son of Jor-El. I'm sure Superman would be eager to stop these villains if he weren't so busy chasing Lois Lane. In the time since the original SUPERMAN, Lois has become suspicious of Clark Kent and has almost made the connection between him and Superman. So Lois continues searching for the final evidence to Superman's identity, while Clark continues battling his feelings for Lois, and Zod strolls around conquering Earth without breaking a sweat. Meanwhile, for those who couldn't get enough Lex Luthor in the first film, he returns in SUPERMAN II toI dunnomove the plot along. And steal Australia. He wants Australia.I've gone and watched both versions and I agree with the majority on this one: the Richard Donner version is much better than Lester's. It's no surprise. Donner originally intended SUPERMAN and it's sequel to be shot at the same time and work together to create one epic cohesive story. Then the producers and Donner encountered some ""creative differences"", Donner was let go from his position, and the producers brought in Lester to finish the second film. Lester than opted to amp up the humor in the movie and brought the campiness. This is most apparent in a scene late in the movie when Superman is battling the Kryptonian supervillains in Metropolis and the villains utilize their super-breath to swat away the rioting civilians. Lester used this opportunity to throw in any goofy thing he could think ofman on rollerblades, man who refuses to get off payphone as it's blowing down the street, etc. Donner, on the other hand, has a bit more respect for his Superman movies. It's a shame his re-cut of the second movie would be the last time Donner worked on the series. Donner had bits of comic relief in his film (i.e. Warren Beatty as Lex Luthor's bumbling henchman Otis) but it's primarily gone in this movie and the any laughs come from genuine character moments. Luthor is still an grandiose lunatic with an evil bent and a lust for real estate, and Gene Hackman's return to the role is one the best parts of the film. Granted, he really doesn't have much to do this time around. He's not the main villain of the piece (despite his best efforts) and his only real job is to direct Zod and his team in the right direction to keep the plot moving while giving us a few laughs.Donner's vision for Superman was one of grand scale fantasy with action, adventure, romance, and humor. Despite Lester's best efforts, even his version maintains some of these elements. SUPERMAN II has got even better action than the first film because Superman finally has someone he can go toe-to-toe with. Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) are super-powered Kryptonians with all of Superman's strengths with an added bonus: pure evil with no compassion for the human race. Together, they just might be more than the Man of Steel can handle as we see in a battle in the streets of Metropolis. Zod is one of those memorable on-screen comic villains and Stamp brought him to life with a massive superiority complex that helped make ""Kneel before Zod!"" so memorable a line. Outside this, there isn't a whole lot of meat to the evil Kryptonians in SUPERMAN II. They're super-powered and evil, they want to rule the Earth, and they hold a grudge against Kal-El. That's about all the character development we receive for our villains but I give it a pass because they're so fun to watch.Christopher Reeves once again proves he was a perfect choice for his role as the Man of Steel and Margot Kidder returns as the spunky Lois Lane. Their chemistry together is on display again as, just as with the first SUPERMAN, we spend a heavy chunk of time watching the development of their relationship. Whereas the first movie was the blossoming love of Clark for Lois (and Lois for Superman), SUPERMAN II takes it to the next level with Lois putting the pieces together to discover Superman's true identity. The results in Superman and Lois being absent from the action for the first half of the movie as he courts her in his Fortress of Solitude and engages in some plot holes until Superman finally catches a newscast and realizes, ""Whoops, I should be saving the planet right about now."" Superman and Lois's little side project of love is again acceptable because of the chemistry between the two leads and how fun it is to watch them.In the end, I suppose SUPERMAN II is no better or worse than the first film but it's at least as entertaining and we get a nice change with the super-powered villains. Fans of the first film are guaranteed to enjoy SUPERMAN II, possibly even more than the original and I'm pretty sure most fans of this series would agree that Richard Donner's cut is way more satisfying.",Superman II
74,mhorg2018,Beginning of the end for the first Superman Franchise,7,14 July 2018,"Firing Richard Donner was one of the dumbest things the Salkinds could do. Fleischer does a workman like job, but this has none of the pizzazz of the first film and some of the dumbest ideas, only overtaken by Shumachers ruination of Batman.

75,mike48128,A Decent Sequel but Disappointing as Well,8,23 June 2013,"Too much humor, which spoils the grandeur present, for the most part, in the first movie. Unconvincing sets: the Southern town, the diner, cardboard & fake-looking cars and trucks. I could go on, but let's get more specific. Inane dialog abounds. Who cares about the deputy's lunch choices? Bad British accents slip out from time-to-time from ""Zod"" and weren't re-looped. The cars, trucks, and buses look like the thin-tin replicas that they are when thrown about by Superman and Zod. The scenes in the White House are actually boring; there is no tension or sense of horror there. Why does Superman have to become a powerless human just to bed and wed Lois? Perhaps Kyptonian and human sexual ""parts"" are incompatible or maybe Jor-el doesn't want any half human progeny? It's never fully explained; I suppose to keep the film-rating family-friendly? Many of the sets look fake or cheap. Even the ""urban diner"". Overall, it's easy to see what Richard Lester directed. His scenes are flat, dull, and too comedic. It's amazing that this film is as good as it is. Again, shameless product-placements abound. The Canadian Niagara Falls honeymoon suite looks like it came out of a comic book. It's ridiculous-looking. The only thing that saves this movie is the unwavering spirit of Christopher Reeve. He may have been in several badly-crafted Superman movies, but he always personified the character. He was Superman and always will be.",Superman II

77,dunmore_ego,"It's a bird. It's plain. It's not super, man.",6,31 July 2007,"""KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!""Could that possibly be the cheesiest line in cinematic history? Yes. Yes, it could; most certainly aided by the level of fruitage employed by Terence Stamp as the titular General Zod, resplendent in black, pseudo-leather, thigh-high disco boots and heavier eyeliner than Heidi Fleiss.Director Richard Donner, filmed *Superman* (1978) and *Superman II* simultaneously for expediency. Creative differences between producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Donner caused Donner to jump ship before finishing *II*, leaving inferior director Richard Lester to salvage the shreds of two movies' worth of footage into a cogent sequel. Consequently, *Superman II* is two movies mashed together to make HALF a movie. Badly scripted (by too many cooks  Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman, Tom Mankiewicz), badly acted (by *Superman*'s principal cast: Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Valerie Perrine, Marc McClure, Gene Hackman  well, Hackman's good in anything, but his scenes in *II* were shot with Donner, and he refused to do any more scenes for *II*, which resulted in stand-ins finishing his job from behind), badly directed (Lester's forte was comedy), badly edited (by John Victor-Smith, with amateurish looping and unsalvageable scenes that had to be included because nothing else was shot), badly scored (by Ken Thorne, trying to augment the great John Williams' music, but churning out a bombastic hash instead); were it not for Superman himself  that blue-clad icon with the red towel tied 'round his neck burned into our neo-cortexes since birth  this movie would be as unbearably ludicrous as E.G. Marshal's wig. Superman hurls a nuclear bomb into space, which is so powerful it releases three Kryptonian super-villains from the *previous* Superman movie - Zod (Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas, as some kind of sadomasochist dyke) and Non (Jack O'Halloran, as a big dumb galoot)  who, all possessing the same powers as Superman, decide to conquer Earth just as Superman decides to conquer Lois Lane by inexplicably abdicating his powers to show his love for her. Smart move, puss.Did Kal-El fail to consider that trailer-park Lois fell in lust with a SUPER man and that the loss of his powers would translate to a 9-to-fiver brain-fry existence, coming home to find Lois with a mud pack on her face watching Jerry Springer, ignoring the screaming kid? And having an affair with Green Lantern. After all, that's what she ""fell in love"" with  super powers. ""In brightest day, in blackest night / No evil shall escape my sight"" Whatever you say, Greenie, you had me at ""Let's fly to Paris for lunch""Kal-El's disembodied mother (Susannah York  because Brando wouldn't) warns him that there will be Far Less Pussy once he takes the Irreversible Step in becoming human; nonetheless, Superman enters an anti-super chamber, gets irradiated with brothel-red lights and leaves the chamber in chic John Holmes threads and a really bad hairstyle. Cue 70's porn music.Meanwhile, General Zod is camping it up in Midwest Podunk with his dyke and galoot, orating cheese in High English vernacular, then kicking the badass American army in the groin and storming the White House to make the President (E.G. Marshal's crooked wig) kneel before him.The unthinking script has Ursa mock a helicopter, ""Look! They need machines to fly!"" (well, so did you on Krypton, honey) and pick up a snake that bites and hurts her  even though she is a veritable woman of steel. The script continues to unthink as Clark, driving a hire car back from the North Pole with Lois, gets his shiny new human ass whipped by a trucker and, to add insult to his injuries, also learns of the three super-villains who are stealing his thunder-cheese. (As a further insult, the trucker was probably Canadian.) Fearing it just might have been a mistake to go *homo sapien* (what gave it away  the internal bleeding?), he hikes back to the Pole to get his supermojo back (I guess three super-villains taking over the world wasn't a big enough emergency for Lois to give him the HIRE CAR - already treating him like a nut-less puss).And  like Final Notices, Final Destinations, Drop-Dead Deadlines, etc. - we find that the Irreversible anti-super effect wasn't that Irreversible after all, as Superman's blue-groined hard-body is soon streaking through Metropolis skies to tangle with the three super-villains with stunningly mediocre special effects.It is a real pity that the *Superman* franchise is not better than it is, because there is something so inspiring and awesome about John Williams' soundtrack, truly capturing the essence of thunderous power, a majestic, sweeping paean of an otherworldly being who can bend the world at will. We vicariously thrill to the possibilities of being a Superman, or of loving a Superman. It's the lottery one-hundredfold.Ironic that General Zod mincing, ""KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!"" was part of the reason the franchise was brought to its knees.",Superman II
78,Maciste_Brother,Sloppy seconds,4,3 March 2004,"The story behind SUPERMAN 2 is well known. SUPERMAN THE MOVIE director, Richard Donner, was fired from SUPERMAN 2 after shooting something like 75% of the film. The producers hired Richard Lester and shot many new scenes that were to be combined with some of the scenes Donner directed. The end result is that the film looks like a terrible patchwork of many things and SUPERMAN 2 just feels like a HUGE sloppy production.As an aficionado of movie mistakes and continuity errors, the only thing I can say about SUPERMAN 2 is that it's a feast for my eyes. It's really fascinating to watch. In the Richard Donner scenes, Margot Kidder looks healthy and beautiful. In the Lester scenes, Margot looks positively gaunt and anorexic. The effect of seeing Margot change from unhealthy to healthy and back to unhealthy throughout the movie is jarring. Then there's the slight alterations that were made to the villains costumes from the Donner shots and the new Lester shots. Notice Ursa's costume is more revealing in the Donner scenes than in the Lester directed ones. Also, Terence Stamp looks much thinner in the Lester shots. And the villains also have less white makeup in the Lester directed shots.But even if the jarring effect of watching the Donner and Lester scenes coexist together is enough to make one's head spin, the individually directed scenes of SUPERMAN 2, mainly the Lester ones, can only be described as all round sloppy. For instance, the whole Paris scene. In Metropolis, Perry White tells Clark that Lois Lane is in Paris covering the story of terrorists with a hydrogen bomb, but the scene after that one we see Lois in Paris, talking to the police officer and she's told by the police officer that there's a hydrogen bomb in the Eiffel Tower and Lois acts surprised, like she was just told about it for the first time. I'm sure the scene with Lois in Paris was supposed to appear first and then followed by Perry telling Clark about Lois in Paris. But as it is in the film, the order of the scenes doesn't make any sense.When Superman and Non chase each other over the water, we actually see the wake of the boat filming the footage of the river and cityscape. This shot shouldn't have made it in the final cut. Why did Lester leave it in? It's really bad. There there's the whole battle at the end, which is played strictly for camp. People losing their wigs. Ice cream flying into people's faces. Phone booths falling with people inside. A-ha...not. Note to Richard Lester: this is not a Beatles movie.For a film that cost $50 million, everything about SUPERMAN 2 feels cheap.Cheap production values, like the moon set or the NY city street set, the village set, etc. The village set is probably the least convincing movie set ever built for a major movie. Cheap use of stock footage, from the first SUPERMAN movie, such as when Clark and Lois return from the north pole and the car driving through the Rockies is actually the car that's flipped over in SUPERMAN THE MOVIE. Or the use of fly over footage taken from the first movie which was used for the rockets is now used for the villains when they fly towards the village.Cheap special effects, like the dreadful animation when the phantom zone thingy goes through shockwave from the nuclear blast. Zod walking on water and you can clearly see the plank underneath the surface of the water. The helicopter being tossed around by Ursa's kiss. The use of little dolls for Superman or the villains flying all over NY city scape. There are some good FX here and there (my favorite is when Non goes through the buildings) but most of the special effects are *really* bad, even for that time.Sloppy writing. The inconsistent use of superpowers. In SUPERMAN THE MOVIE, Superman could fly super fast and affect time itself. But in SUPERMAN 2, it takes Superman forever to arrive in Paris. The villains (and Superman) have bizarre powers like levitating objects with their eyes or by just pointing their fingers. When Ursa is bitten by the snake, it hurts her. The snake must have fangs made out of steel. Zod easily destroys cars with his laser eyes but it takes him forever to blow up a tanker truck. Non and Ursa throw a bus at Superman, which crushes him like a ton of bricks. But didn't Superman change the direction of the rotation of the earth in SUPERMAN THE MOVIE? What's a bus compared to the gravitational force of a whole planet?Then there's the whole stupid moment in Niagara. Who came up with this stupid script?!?! And some of the dialogue is just painful. And to make things even worse, there are tons of product placement throughout the movie.By reading this, you might think I hate the movie. And to a certain extent, there's something about SUPERMAN 2 I just don't like but I admit that the spirit of the film is goofy. The awe and majesty of SUPERMAN THE MOVIE is replaced by schlocky, stupid fun. Like the producers just didn't care about anything and decided, ""What the hell. Who cares about all of this. Let's make fun of it all.""The one thing I really like in SUPERMAN 2 is URSA. Sarah Douglas is the best thing in the movie. Ursa ROCKS!!!!!!! The highlight of the film is when Ursa flips a manhole cover and throws it mercilessly at Superman. Cool.Anyway, my main problem with SUPERMAN 2, aside from the really stupid script, is that's it's just cheap looking. It's the cheapest looking big budget movie of all time. It cost $50 million back then. That's $200 million today? Where did the money go?!?!",Superman II

80,TheUnknown837-1,It feels as though there is something missing,6,29 September 2012,"The heart of the original ""Superman,"" for me, was not in its special effects or panoramic directing—although both of those were delightfully good as well—but in its eccentric love triangle. In the middle was the feisty Lois Lane; on one end was our titular superhero from the planet Krypton; on the other end was his goodhearted twerp of an alter-ego, Clark Kent. I liked this dynamic so much in the original film that I actually wanted a little less of the spectacle that made up the climax and a little more of their chemistry. For those reasons, and others, I found myself astonished that ""Superman II,"" which expands upon the love story, left me feeling rather cold and uninvolved by the end.A hill-and-valley effect plagues the sequel. Sequences are soaring high one minute and plummeting hard the next. I've read accounts that ""Superman II"" had a troubled production with the film changing directors after a good chunk of the picture had been shot, and unfortunately the schizophrenic relationships on the set do show in the final product. It really does feel as though there is something missing in just about every scene. I do not know who to point fingers at (the new director, Richard Lester, or his screenwriters) but almost every scene caps off with a set of lame jokes. A defining moment would be an early-on chapter where three arch-villains from Superman's home planet attack some astronauts on the moon. The scene itself is padded out tediously and wraps itself up with some lame meanwhile-in-Houston shots as NASA people on the ground quip about age differences. Other times, such as when those same villains arrive on earth and start pillaging a Midwest town, Director Lester builds up some promising moments and just when they seem to get interesting, he cuts away often with an odd two-shot of some characters. Again, it feels as though there is something missing.But whereas some scenes feel as though they are too short, there are others that persist on going on too long. Superman has two encounters with these villains from outer space. One of them is staged in downtown Metropolis, and it is insufferably boring. Bad editing really stands out when a sequence filled with colorful explosions, lasers crossing the skies, and cars being blown across main street, crashing into everything, seems to drag on forever. But it is. When the three villains spew hurricane-force winds from their lips to repel a rioting crowd of citizens, not only do we get too many shots of people and cars toppling over, but too many silly shots of the villains with their lips puckered. The rest of the battle, apart from containing too many effects shots, is crippled by a constant urge by Director Lester to include reaction shots of citizens. And as the scene went on and on, I kept on wondering just what was all the attention for on these three black-suited bores.There lies my other big quip with the movie: the villains are pretentious bores. Even though one of them, the leader Zod, is acted excellently by the underrated Terence Stamp, none of these fiends struck me as particularly menacing. They had no energy and no real presence. Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), the villain of the first picture, returns and does have some good individual moments. But by the end of it all, Mr. Hackman's inclusion just seems like a studio obligation—after all, he gets top billing over everybody else. I wanted a whole lot more of Mr. Hackman's Lex Luthor and his comical stooges than General Zod and his pretentious stooges.But what about the love story I like so much? True, there are more scenes between Christopher Reeve, as Superman, and Margot Kidder, as Lois Lane. Sadly, they are mostly reserved for the first half of the movie, as Miss Kidder starts to unravel Mr. Reeve's big secret. Every moment where Clark Kent and Lois are pretending to be newlyweds visiting Niagara Falls, and there are a lot of these early on, are solid gold. These sequences are terrific, as are the ones that resolve their dynamic at the end of the movie. But in the middle, save for an impressively directed scene set in a diner—actually the best part of the movie—their chemistry seems to teeter. As a result, Superman's already sudden decision to give up his powers to live with Lois comes across even more rash than the filmmakers, and characters, probably intended.",Superman II
81,brchthethird,A worthy sequel that makes some interesting tonal choices,7,8 June 2015,"At some point with certain kinds of movies, you just have to ignore whatever preconceived notions you have about the subject matter, sit back, and enjoy what unfolds before you on screen. I wouldn't call myself a Superman fan, per se, but midway through this film I decided to stop resisting and let it be. I wouldn't exactly call SUPERMAN II superb filmmaking, but as a blockbuster sequel it's certainly up there in terms of quality. It also makes a knowing turn toward the silly, which was present in the first one, but here is utilized even more. Yes, there are plot elements that make no sense, but what's important is that I had some fun.The film begins by doing a recap of its predecessor, in case you forgot the events that occurred beforehand and then launches straight into the main story. When Superman saves a bunch of tourists (and Lois Lane) in Paris from terrorists wielding a hydrogen bomb, he leaves Earth's atmosphere and releases it into space. The force of the explosion shatters the Phantom Zone prison where Zod, Ursa and Non are kept and they make their way to Earth in order to rule it. There's also the risible subplot about Superman giving up his powers in order to be with Lois Lane, but thankfully that doesn't take up as much screen time as you'd think. Lex Luthor also shows up for a few scenes, but isn't really given that much to do.First, the good. At first, I was taken aback at just how silly the film was. However, it grew on me. Zod and his minions were easily the best part of the whole film. Campy? Yes. But what exactly did you expect from an alien whose only motive is subjugation, and who is completely out of touch with Earth culture? I think I liked Michael Shannon's take on the character better, but Terence Stamp was great too, in a different way. Other elements I liked were the improved special effects, although a climactic fight scene between Zod and Superman in the air kind of showed the limitations of what was achievable in the early 80's. Still, the production values were excellent. And the sweeping vistas during the flying sequences were something to behold. Acting was generally good across the board, although no one was ""awards-worthy."" Christopher Reeve was undoubtedly the best among the cast, and I like how played up the differences between Clark Kent and Superman. And of course, the score was phenomenal. Apparently, John Williams wasn't the composer this time around, but they used a lot of his material from the first film.All of my complaints are largely to do with incredulous or ludicrous plot elements. First: Superman gives up his powers to be with Lois Lane? Come on. He's supposed to be devoted to ""truth, justice, and the American way"" (however corny that is), and he lets a woman come in between him and the mission handed down to him from his father? Sure, whatever. Directly tying into that scene, how does he get back to Metropolis after giving up his power of flight? In the scene where he goes back to his Fortress of Solitude to reverse his previous decision it's implied that he walk. But seriously? Not only does he walk from the North Pole to Metropolis, but does it twice? That part really took me out of the story. And then there's the part towards the end where he uses the Superman symbol on his chest to incapacitate Non. Even in a movie that's knowingly campy, that was a little much.However, despite the campiness there was a sense that the filmmakers were aware of this fact, which made the film more palatable to me. The source material isn't the greatest stuff in the world and yet they managed to make an entertaining blockbuster sequel that builds on what they created in the first one. Yes, there are some absolutely gut-busting funny moments, and not necessarily in a good way, but there was a pervasive sense of fun that allowed me to overlook a lot of what didn't work. If pressed to choose, I still think I enjoyed SUPERMAN a little more, but SUPERMAN II is no slouch either.",Superman II
82,mentalcritic,A lesson to be learned,2,9 October 2006,"In the early 1980s, comic book adaptations were the big thing, chiefly because special effects technology had finally caught up to what was required. The 1978 film's tagline said it all, we did believe Superman could really fly, even if the quality of the footage took a noticeable dive when he did so. And thus, a battle broke out in terms of how to treat the story. In one corner, we had writers and directors who took the mythos of their subjects seriously, exploring the characters in dramatic ways. Then in the other corner, we had the writers and directors who assumed these films were exclusively for children, and therefore did not need to be treated with respect. It is a testament to the stupidity of the human creature that this debate continues to rage in Hollywood after monumental disappointments such as Superman III, Batman & Robin, or the recent pile of droppings they attempted to pass off as a third X-Men film. Put simply, whereas directors like Richard Donner or Bryan Singer will be revered for decades to come for their adaptations, Richard Lester's name is mud among Superman fans.It all began with arguments over creative direction. Warner Brothers and the Salkind estate made bucketloads of money out of the original Superman adaptation, which took the box office by storm. Exactly how they got the idea that they would make even more money by emulating the 1960s Batman television show where possible is beyond me, but get the idea they did. Arguments ensued over how the characters should speak, how the powers of Superman should be represented, and even how the film should be financed. The end result was that Donner was ousted as director and replaced by Richard Lester, who as I have already explained, came from the opposite camp with regard to respect for the source material. Lester's penchant for physical comedy presents a noticeable conflict between various scenes in the film, although it is fortunately not up to the sheer level of annoyance exhibited in the third film. The result is somewhat like putting two films in a bowl, blending, and presenting what comes out.Fortunately, the principal strength of the Superman films to that point had been in the storytelling and casting. Christopher Reeve was a miraculous find in the titular role, presenting a strong and forceful Superman without overwhelming his support cast. I cannot say I appreciate the Clark Kent alter ego to the same extent, but that's a minor aside. An action film's hero is only as good as his antagonist, and we get three great antagonists here. Jack O'Halloran has the toughest assignment as Non, who menaces almost all around him without speaking a singular word. O'Halloran plays the part entirely with body language and gestures, and gives one of the best performances in the film. Sarah Douglas holds up the side brilliantly as Ursa, a ridiculously cruel woman who seems either be totally unaware of the extreme pain she puts her prey through, or totally unmoved by it. Half the time, it is even money as to whether Ursa or Non make the more intimidating support villain.But it is Terence Stamp as General Zod who walks away with the acting prize here. In a contrast to stereotypical comic book villains of the time, he plays Zod as a quiet, reflective man. Not only does it make for a great contrast to the psychopathic woman and caveman-throwback he is seen with at all times, it lets the viewer know that he has more than one dimension. In many a review of a bad film in which one character is made out to be more evil than evil, the proposition that the actor went to the director and tried to make the case that the character does not see themselves as evil has been put forth. Zod takes it a bit further. He knows he is quite evil, and makes no bones about it. He is evil because his contempt for creatures around him that he sees as weak or cowardly removes all limits to his actions. In many ways, he reflects a more clandestine evil in our present world that would probably attempt to ""cure"" Superman of his superpowers. Stamp is a true actor's actor, and nowhere is this clearer than in Superman II.The problem is that Lester shows great contempt for his audience. The slapstick gags would have been fine had they been kept in context and given some limits. The real problem is that Lester does not seem to care about preserving the continuity of the film series, or even the laws of the world that Superman inhabits. Nor does he seem to care about the little micro-laws that dictate Superman's reactions to situations. Things like the amnesia kiss (a power from the comic books so rarely used that it was pretty much retired) were not so much the problem as the seeming inability to make the film without plot convenience. Many directors before and since, Peter Jackson and Brett Ratner being good recent examples, have demonstrated that they would jump out of the window before waiting for the paint that has them trapped in the corner to dry. His second personal quote in his IMDb biography is especially hypocritical in light of what he did here. Fortunately, as the likes of Bryan Singer serve to remind us of why we go to see these films in the first place, Lester's is a dying breed.For all these reasons, I gave Richard Lester's version of Superman II a five out of ten. Richard Donner has said that all the good parts of Superman II are his, and it is these parts one should watch it for.",Superman II
83,ODDBear,Spectacular sequel,9,15 December 2006,"The Superman saga continues in grand style as The Man of Steel battles three Kryptonian villains who accidentally get freed from The Phantom Zone and plan to rule the earth. They get a good head start as Superman is temporarily out of business as he's romancing Lois Lane.Grand spectacles and plenty of action is the order of the day here in this spectacular sequel that manages to be more entertaining than the first one. That's not to say it's better, the original still has that claim as it's more of an epic film with more story. The romantic angle gets plenty of screen time and is wonderfully handled, giving added weight to Superman as a vulnerable being. Margot Kidder and especially Christopher Reeve excel in their roles. But the action is never far behind and the villain showdown is legendary and for good reason. Great action scenes abound as the battle nearly ruins the city of Metropolis. Considering the production difficulties of this film in the wake of Richard Donner's departure it's amazing how well it flows. There are some annoying plot holes and things left unexplained but that doesn't diminish the film's dynamic entertainment value. Superman II is the only worthy sequel as III and IV were mostly disappointments. Director Richard Lester wisely kept the tone of the film mostly intact after he took over, only sporadically succumbing to slapstick humor. He did a great job at the helm and probably doesn't get enough credit for it.",Superman II
84,Beta_Gallinger,"While the romance can be poorly done, it doesn't prevent this from being a decent first sequel",7,3 January 2011,"I finally saw the first of the four ""Superman"" films, based on the comic book series and starring Christopher Reeve, just last month, and since I was impressed with the first installment, I intended to watch the sequels. One can obviously tell by the title of this 1980 release that it's the second installment in the franchise. Richard Donner, who directed its predecessor, was originally the director of this sequel, but was replaced by Richard Lester (I previously knew him as the director of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help!"") before he finished, so some changes were made. Unsurprisingly, it seems that the original 1978 release is the most popular of the bunch, so I wasn't expecting ""Superman II"" to be as good, but I was expecting it to be a worthy second installment, since it was still at least reasonably popular, and it basically turned out to be what I was expecting.Superman still lives in Metropolis, and his alter ego, Clark Kent, still works for the city's Daily Planet newspaper. When he hears that the Eiffel Tower has been seized by terrorists and Lois Lane has been sent to Paris, France to report on this, he flies to the scene, rescues Lois from death, and forces an elevator containing a nuclear bomb into space before it detonates! So, Superman has stopped the terrorist attack, but he doesn't see that General Zod, Ursa, and Non, three criminals from Krypton who were sent away just before the planet's destruction, happen to be floating by in the Phantom Zone when the bomb goes off in space, and the explosion sets them free! The three of them go to the Earth's moon, where they meet astronauts and kill them, and then make their way to Earth with plans to enslave the planet! To make matters worse, Superman's old foe, Lex Luthor, manages to escape from prison! The caped wonder is the only one on Earth who can take on these extraterrestrial criminals, but before he is aware of this invasion, he decides to give up his superpowers and become mortal so he can settle down with Lois, who has recently found out that he is Clark Kent!Christopher Reeve's performance as Superman/Clark Kent here is just like it is in the first installment in the franchise, not stunning, but decent. Some of the other performances here are fairly weak, however, and I think that includes Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran as the three invaders respectively. I certainly wasn't blown away by Margot Kidder's performance as Lois Lane in the first film, but somehow found her to be slightly worse in this second one. The flawed performances may have something to do with the flawed script. Some of the scenes here showing the romance between Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane certainly could have been done much better, and there are more of those here than in the 1978 blockbuster. However, like its predecessor, ""Superman II"" has lots of excitement, starting with the Eiffel Tower segment and then focusing on General Zod, Ursa, and Non's invasion on Earth. It's a well written story, and the excitement level increases after the first hour of the movie or so. Another thing this first sequel has in common with the original is that it can be very pleasing to the eye as well, with the special effects and scenery.Since this is another franchise movie, it's not surprising that it's inferior to the film that started the series. 26 years after the release of this second installment in the famous franchise starring Christopher Reeve came into theatres, ""Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut"", a re-edit of this film featuring lots of never-before-seen footage directed by Donner before he was replaced by Richard Lester for the project, was released. I haven't seen that version yet, having just seen this one, and it seems many consider it to be better than the final theatrical cut, but now that I've seen this version, the one which was seen in theatres in 1980, I think it is a pretty good comic book adaptation, even if it would have been better had Donner not been replaced before finishing the direction. For the most part, this second installment in the movie franchise based on the world-famous DC Comics series does its job, giving many comic book movie fans their share of suspenseful entertainment, despite the significant flaws which make it lose points.",Superman II
85,vip_ebriega,A little better than the original.,8,14 February 2007,"My Take: Better than the original. I loved the original ""Superman:The Movie"" and this sequel. They are really good, but this sequel is a bit more fast-paced than its predecessor. Christopher Reeve is in top shape reprising his role. Margot Kidder adds laughs and romance to our famous hero once again. Richard Lester is an excellent director, putting in a lot of memorable moments in ""Superman II"". From epic battles with three evil Kryptonian prisoners, to tongue-in-cheek laughs and perfect romance between Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane. This sequel even has more special-effects than the original, which, although not quite as astounding to today's standards, is still colorful to watch. The kids and adults will definitely love watching this. A bit better than the original. It's imperfect, but then again that's not what we have come to expect. Buy any cut you want. Either Richard Lester's or Richard Donner's (haven't watched this yet). This film is still excellent.Rating: **** out of 5.",Superman II
86,fmarkland32,Meeting your match...,8,29 June 2006,"This time Superman (Played well by Christopher Reeve) meets his match in the villains of Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran who have all the super powers of Superman but out-number him, however things complicate when Superman trades in his power for a normal life, although he realizes he must fight the overwhelming odds when the terrible threesome take over the planet. Superman II is often times considered to be an improvement over the first one and while this is certainly a great movie to watch, I personally prefer Superman #1 due to it's sense of wonder and good natured drive. That is not to say that Superman II doesn't always equal the greatness of # 1, for instance the romance between Lois Lane(Margot Kidder) and Clark Kent/Superman(Christopher Reeve) provides unexpected texture to the climatic proceedings, even if it is somewhat of a letdown by what happens at the end. The villains are well played and the ice palace is great. Although the character of Lex Luther is a big distraction, especially since he's hardly the threat that the three super villains are. Still for a superior adaptation of a comic book, Superman II is one of the best.* * *1/2 out of 4-(Very good)",Superman II
87,adamscastlevania2,"Decent, but the original is better",6,7 October 2014,"(54%) Unlike today were the studios aim their big movies solely at teenage boys to the detriment of everything else (Man of steel), whilst back in the day they at least tried to make a movie everyone can enjoy. So here there is at least some romantic interaction between Lois and Clark, there is some light-hearted fun, and Superman by the end isn't at least partly responsible for the death of millions of people. There is no desire to make him dark and moody either, he is just a good guy that wants to help people whenever he can. The plot/script is more than a little broken here though as Lois almost kills herself trying to find out if Clark is Superman which just doesn't work, and some of the dialogue is weak. But it is fun and very entertaining, just not as solid as the original.",Superman II
88,KnightsofNi11,Not as good as the first but still pretty fun,6,10 July 2012,"Two years after the smash hit Superman revitalized the superhero film industry a sequel was released that brings back almost all of the cast and continues where Superman left off. At the beginning of Superman Jor-El exiles three villainous criminals from Krypton. They are cast out into the Phantom Zone and we don't hear from them again for the rest of the film. Then comes Superman II when the three Kryptonian criminals manage to escape the Phantom Zone and they head for Earth so as to conquer it. Obviously, Superman is the only thing standing in their way, and he is also the only thing that can protect Earth from total domination.After the release of Superman there was incredible fallout between the director and the producers. Once all the debris had settled we were left with the same producers but a new director. Richard Lester had come on board to replace Richard Donner and he branded the Superman franchise with a slightly different style. One that appeals more to a comic book aesthetic more than the grand scale David Lean-esque epic style that Donner created with the first film. Thus, Superman II is a little campier and less magnificent than it's predecessor. There are certain things about it that I liked more than the first film, and some things I like less.Superman had a streak of light hearted humor and playful campiness to it, but Superman II accelerates that to a whole new level. The humor in the sequel almost seems to mock the superhero at times. It's fun and it makes the film entertaining, but it doesn't feel quite right, and it detracts from the overall impact of the film much more than Superman did.My biggest issue with Superman II, however, has to be the continuity and the plot holes that run rampant throughout the film. The film is full of logical fallacies which get on my nerves, and a lot of these you just have to look past because, at the end of the day, it is a Superman film. But what really got me was the logic in the plot at times. One of the major events of the plot is Superman having to give up his powers to be with Lois Lane. His mother tells him he will never be able to get his powers back after he gives them up, yet about twenty minutes after he gives them up and General Zod and company are attacking Metropolis, Superman returns all suited up and ready to fight. It never explains how he got his powers back and I'm just left wondering how something like that slipped through the cracks. It's pretty aggravating, and it made Superman II a slightly less enjoyable experience.But, looking past the gaps in the plot, as a simple superhero action flick Superman II really does succeed. There are some great fights throughout the film and some very excitingly well shot action sequences. The fight between the three Kryptonian villains and Superman in downtown Metropolis has all the Superman action we could ever ask for, and the final showdown in Superman's crystal fortress is awesome as well. Superman II has it's issues that keep it from being as good as it's predecessor, and I also didn't like it as much just out of personal taste. But it's definitely a pretty good film and as a Superman film it most certainly delivers. If you enjoyed the first film at all you shouldn't miss out on Superman II.",Superman II
89,DarthBill,Superman Returns,7,11 February 2004,"It's really a shame that those jerks the Salkinds fired Richard Donner after he made the first Superman movie into a smash hit. For one thing, the 2nd one could have and would have been better with Donner still at the helm and, quite possibly, ""Superman III"" and ""Supergirl"" may not have sucked. The only thing in the movie that Richard Lester really deserves any credit for is directing the 12 minute fight in Metropolis between Superman, General Zod, Non and Ursa. That scene is still fun to watch, even with today's overblown CGI.Well, #2 is the love story entry in the series as Lois Lane discovers that Superman and Clark Kent are the same guy and she lets him know about her infatuation with him. They go steady in his Fortress of Solitude, he gives up his powers so he can live a normal life with her (which the comic book Superman WOULD NEVER DO) then he has to get them restored after he finds out that the villains General Zod, Ursa and Non are raising hell and taking over the planet. Lex Luther is also back for the 2nd go around.
People keep complaining that the film doesn't explain how Superman got his powers restored. Well, I have an old copy of an ABC Sunday night showing of ""Superman II"" and, mind you I still haven't bought the DVD, the TV showing implied that Superman used the green crystal - the same one that started off his awakening in the first movie and built the Fortress of Solitude - to restore his powers. And according to an interview I read with Richard Donner, the whole idea was that Superman restored his powers by draining all the crystals in his Fortress of Solitude and lost the ability to contact the ghosts of his parents in the process. Another plot hole I can't get over is how Superman ever fell for the Margot Kidder version of Lois Lane - she's an illiterate, chain smoking scatter brain! Gene Hackman still gives the worst performance of his career as Lex Luther, but hey, it's Gene!Legend has it that Hackman refused to do ""Superman III"" because he was outraged over the way the Salkinds had treated Richard Donner.Christopher Reeve is still a good Superman though, and here he actually has a real threat in the form of cold blooded Terence Stamp as General Zod, who is helped by Jack O'Halloran's mute hulk Non and Sarah Douglas's misanthropic Ursa (she later played the evil queen in ""Conan the Destroyer""). And as mentioned above, the fight between Superman and Zod's trio is a knock out. Don't miss Christopher Reeve/Superman throwing Terence Stamp/Zod into the giant neon Coke sign!",Superman II
90,ivo-cobra8,The best sequel of all time my personal favorite a bit underrated,10,7 October 2016,"Superman II (1980) is so underrated by fans and critics of Richard Donner's cut who are the same people rooting for Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice! Part II is another classic and excellent sequel from the 80's and the film from my childhood, not as good as the first original film, but still good. I am always going to cherish this movie. It is my personal Superman favorite sequel movie since my childhood. Christopher Reeve is the only Superman for me. I am defending this film from haters and people who put's down iconic superhero sequel who saves people. For some reason I didn't think it was as good as I remember and for my honest opinion it is still better than Richard Donner's cut or Zack Snyder movies! I grew up watching this film, I was 6 years old when I saw Richard Lester's version on TV but I only saw half of the film. Superman III was the first film I saw on VHS as a child, this was the third film I saw. I love this film to death I love this film the same as I love Superman I and III and it is my favorite sequel. Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark Kent/Superman like Christopher Reeve, the film is still instantiate classic till it's day. If anyone could be Superman. It is Christopher Reeve, he fits the part perfectly as the shy yet great reporter Clark Kent, Kal-El last son of Krypton, and Superman, Earths savior from the forces of evil. Superman is a world known icon and is permanently set in stone as the best Superhero of all time. Though, the only Superman movies I enjoyed are the first three Superman movies that had Christopher Reeve in it! I hate the new Superman: Henry Cavill, he is not a Superman as I remember when I was a kid! We have now a Superman who kills people, who let's people die and he only thinks on him self, his mother Martha and Lois! I hate Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Superman Returns, Man of Steel, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice! Superman saves a lot of people in this film, a kid who falls of Niagra fall's, a young mommy and her baby, turn's off the fire from a oil truck caused by Zod. I love Superman Christopher Reeve in this film and I was always fan of this film!John Williams theme is still a classic song to Superman my favorite iconic character!Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it:Eve Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) disappears from the storyline after she and Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) leave Superman's Fortress Of Solitude, and her absence from the rest of the movie is never explained. Ned Beatty as Otis also disappears from the storyline, why putting these two characters in this movie when they both had a cameo scene without explanation in it, is beyond me, even it was from Richard Donner cut, they could have removed it anyway.Clark Kent revels his powers to Lois (Margot Kidder) that he is Superman and he sacrifice his powers for Lois that I stupid idea! After 1 hour Clark find's out that General Zod (Terence Stamp) and his goons conquering Earth behind his back and Superman wasn't there to stop theme, I don't like this thing in this film at all. I don't like Ursa killing astronaut and kicking him in the groan. I hate Sarah Douglas, Margot Kidder and Jack O'Halloran for dissing Christopher Reeve! The only two actors I have respect beside Christopher Reeve is: Gene Hackman and Terence Stamp who was even in Smallville as the voice of Jor-El, Clark's biological father. Terence Stamp was perfect choice for playing General Zod he was brilliant and excellent as the main villain - respect to this actor! Overall: I don't like Richard Donner's Cut: the scene where Lois jumped into the Niagra Falls and Clark had to save her without revealing his identity... that was not in the film. It is a shame because I love that scene. Instead, Lois shoots Clark to prove he is Superman. There are also a few more scenes cut out and replaced with other scenes. It is very interesting to see a different version of the film. But I have great memories of watching this film when I was a kid so I prefer the original version.R.I.P. - Christopher Reeve (1952 - 2004) the only Clark Kent/Superman who we always be my favorite superhero of all time! This movie for my opinion is 10/10 I don't care what anyone says about this movie or Richard Donner's cut that it is better in my opinion I enjoy this movie much way better.",Superman II
91,gab-14712,A Worthy Superman Sequel!,8,9 March 2019,"Superman II is the only one of the three original sequels produced that could live up to the classic 1978 Superman. That is a surprise because the drama behind the movie is more famous than the movie itself. There are two cuts of the movie. The Richard Donner version and the Salkind version in which they brought in comedy director Richard Lester to direct the movie or what little remained to be shot. That said, I thought this movie was enjoyable! Compared to the first film, it had a lighter tone and comedy was used more here. I will say the film does come close to overstaying with its comedy. I also liked the introduction of three villains-the three Kryptons led by General Zod.Before we discuss the film, it is important to talk about the behind-the-scenes drama. Richard Donner, who directed the 1978 original film, was filming the sequel back-to-back. The producers-the Salkinds, decided to shut down production so they can focus on promoting the first film. Donner already shot 75% of the film. Later on, Donner was having issues with producer Pierre Spengler and refused to return to complete the film as long as Spengler was onset. So the Salkinds moved on and brought in Richard Lester to complete the reshoots. The cast was furious at this decision, so much that Gene Hackman wouldn't return to complete his scenes as Lex Luthor. Also, Marlon Brando had to be cut out of the film because he sued the producers because he claimed he was not given the portion of the box office of the first film. Plus, cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth passed away and composer John Williams left the project after fighting with Lester. Yes, the production was quite a mess. The final product was essentially the combination of the work of two directors thus resulting in a movie with alternating tones. Even the looks of the actors did not match from scene to scene. Which is why I am surprised to see how well the film did critically and financially.There are these terrorists who take over the Eiffel Tower and they threaten to blow up Paris with a hydrogen bomb unless the French government meets their demands. Clark Kent aka Superman (Christopher Reeve) heads to France where he hurdles the bomb into outer space. Unknowingly to Clark, the bomb opens up the Phantom Zone where three Krypontian criminals escape. These criminals, General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran), were imprisoned by Jor-El years prior. These villains head to Earth where they plan to take over, and of course Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) wants to join them, Clark Kent just wants to live in peace and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) figures out his secret. Clark goes to the Fortress of Solitude to rid himself of his powers so he can live with Lois, but those missing powers might be needed soon enough.I have read elsewhere with people saying that Gene Hackman's performance as Lex Luthor marks the worst performance of his career. Personally, that might be going too far. He is clearly having a lot of fun with the schemes of Lex Luthor. I guess that it's the fact he has been in too many high-caliber films. Terence Stamp really gives General Zod a villainous edge as someone you do not want to cross. Christopher Reeve continues his success in his dual roles of Clark Kent and Superman. The movie focuses more on the character relationships between him and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. Both were fantastic and have a certain chemistry with each other. There were some funny moments between the two, especially where Lois Lane is trying to prove that Clark is indeed Superman. That Niagara Falls scene comes to mind and is probably the best sequence of the movie.This movie could have and should have been a complete failure. The mess behind the scenes would have given most movies their premature deaths. Alas, this is Superman so he cannot be conquered so easily. Superman II is not as good as the first film, but it's nowhere near as bad as the sequels that would follow. The film develops more characterization between Superman and Lois and the villains, led by General Zod are fleshed out. The direction is noticeably off as two different directors worked on the same movie. Any scene with Hackman was directed by Donner, as a heads up! The action sequences are well-done, but the special effects are clearly outdated. However, this is a worthy Superman sequel.My Grade: B+",Superman II
92,The_Movie_Cat,The Greatest Superhero Movie Ever Made,8,31 December 1999,"I have a confession to make. I love Superman II. Such innocent, almost niave, filmmaking, it personifies the term ""family entertainment"" and is, simply, great fun to watch.Other superheroes have floundered at the box office, and maybe this is to do with lack of affinity between the makers and the source material. Certainly, the Superman films are tongue-in-cheek but never so that they're disrespectful to their content or their audience. The Crow was a good example of the ""graphic novel"" set, and the Batman series did well under the underrated Michael Keaton, but floundered under the flat Val Kilmer and increasingly childish set-pieces. The less said about ""Batman and Robin"" the better.Of course, Superman had his own ""Batman and Robin"" in the guise of ""Superman VI: The Quest For Peace"", a movie made four years after the third and with seemingly a fraction of the budget. But Superman II was the series at its' peak. The theme music, a startling Star Wars sound-a-like by John Williams, fades to edited recaps of the previous film. These involve Superman as a baby being sent from the destruction of his home planet and are cleverly spliced together so as to avoid having to pay Marlon Brando any more royalties. (Yet we do see Brando's hand. Surely that's worth half a million?). 20% of this movie was shot alongside the 1978 vehicle and so we get reminded in this sequence of the three Kryptonian villains, about to be accidentally released by Superman in a h-bomb explosion.This was still in the days when films were properly constructed to allow for a genuine build-up, a fully-formed middle and a proper end. Even minor players, such as Perry White (Jackie Cooper) have great lines and characterisation thrusted upon them. This may be just a ""fun"" movie, but it is lovingly put together, not ""thrown together"" as many films are. All the actors are wonderful, Christopher Reeve is just right as Superman, Margot Kidder is the definitive Lois Lane (despite almost drowning in soft focus for her close-ups) and Gene Hackman is, of course, absolutely hilarious as Lex Luthor. But my favourite player in this sequel is Terence Camp as General Zod. Terence plays Zod exactly the same as he plays Bernadette in ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" and makes great work of the lead villain that must be, in Hollywood circles, always English. ""Why do you say these things when you know I will kill you for it?"" he minces to Hackman with great effect.Of course, now twenty years old, this film is less ""You'll believe a man can fly"" than ""You'll believe a man can swing on wires in front of an unconvincing backdrop"" but this is still wonderful entertainment. Maybe the middle section, with Clark getting cut to ribbons after being thrown through a plate glass window is a little violent, as is the confrontation between Superman and the trio of villains. There's also the nagging feeling that this section is the biggest single example of product placement ever seen on film. Or is it coincidence that a Superman who featured in a comicbook anti-smoking campaign (against ""Nick O'Teen"", no less) is continually thrown into a Malboro van? Even Zod gets to know ""things look better with Coca-Cola"" as he is unceremoniously hurled into a neon sign for the corporation.But these are minor gripes, and how anyone can hold them against such a harmless film is beyond me. Superman II isn't Citizen Kane by any means, but I defy you to sit through this movie and not love it.",Superman II
93,Ruskington,"Just quietly, one of the best superhero movies ever made",9,13 April 2020,"I'm probably in the minority, but I actually consider Superman II to be far superior to the original. The story is much more engrossing and the addition of the delightfully camp Terence Stamp provides not only a great deal of comic relief but also a much more exciting villain than Gene Hackman's tedious Lex Luther. John Williams' original score is slightly reworked by Ken Thorne but is as powerful and inspiring as before.Christopher Reeve is brilliant once again in the lead role and is given a much better script to work with. His ability to switch characters so subtly is the most impressive aspect of these films and a true testament to his talent. He oozes charm and elegance throughout the film and his on-screen interactions with Margot Kidder are very well executed. Speaking of Kidder, I much prefer her in this movie than the original as we see a softer side to her character without the excessive gushiness.The plot of this movie is just pure unadulterated good fun. Fresh from escaping a giant windowpane, Terence Stamp and his cohorts, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran, make their way to Earth to take revenge on the son of their captor. Superman, meanwhile, is busy giving up his superpowers in order to continue his brief dalliance with Lois Lane. I'm not sure why he had to give anything up to be honest, it seemed like they were fine as it was. Also, it seems like an unnecessarily serious commitment for a couple who haven't even lived together yet. Further still, isn't it a bit selfish of her to expect him to turn his back on the world and all its problems just so they can start a relationship? Anyway, realising his mistake, Superman finds a 'Get out of jail free' crystal at his ice den and returns to Metropolis for a glorious inner-city showdown with the Windowpane 3. Eventually they end up back at Superman's place where some devious double-bluffing from the host results in Zod and friends drowning as mortals in icy water.Along the way there are some great scenes, notably the Eiffel Tower bomb disposal, the Niagara Falls rescue and the Truckstop Diner redemption beatdown (a much-needed payoff to the whole superpower sacrifice fiasco). The film is fun, moves at a quick pace and doesn't take itself too seriously. Stamp and Douglas are menacingly brilliant and help elevate this movie above its predecessor, while Gene Hackman is given a bit of a backseat and is all the better for it.This is simply just a great piece of highly entertaining sci-fi. A wholesome noble hero defending the world from some sinister yet slightly slapstick bad guys while trying his darnedest to maintain the fiddliest of relationships. The best Superman movie ever made and the best way to remember the beautiful soul that was Christopher Reeve.",Superman II
94,aesgaard41,Enjoyable But Campy,7,2 January 2004,"No one who saw the first Superman could possibly refuse seeing this sequel. Frankly, you could attach both movies together into one long six-hour flick and possibly make it even more enjoyable. In the movie, Superman gives up his powers for the love of Lois Lane again played by Margot Kidder, but must get them back as villains from Krypton arrive on Earth and inherit his powers as a result. The humor is good, and it gets interesting as the villains psychoanalyze Superman's responsibilty to work for the forces of good, but then it also gets a bit dry as you realize that unlike the Superman comic, the Man of Steel IS the only hero in this reality. Thor would be a good contender against Zod, the Hulk for Non and Wonder Woman for Ursa, but then it might be more of a Avengers/Justice League flick. But then, the reality is a bit off as the fake city sets distract from the action and the villains have powers that Superman does not have. They change the faces of Mount Rushmore as they fly past the monument, but Superman has none of this power. Zod walks on water; Superman has never done this. Gene Hackman heightens the fun as he portrays Lex Luthor with a comedic light. There is a bad plot device as Lois is forced to forget all that has occurred without any believable reason. The ending is just part groan and part monumental as Superman proves to be superman again.",Superman II
95,TheNorthernMonkee,"Has it's moments, but far too badly dated",3,30 December 2004,"SPOILERS Upon his death in October 2004, a lot of kind words were said about Christopher Reeve. Paralysed in a horse riding accident in 1995, Reeve became a spokesman for those in similar physical conditions. When it came to acting, Reeve was most well known for his portrayal as Superman. Starring in four films between 1978 and 1987, it is this second encounter which is often considered to be the best. This makes life infinitely sadder then, since this second film might have it's moments, but it has just dated so badly that it is often unintentionally laughable.Years ago, before the destruction of Krypton, General Zod (Terence Stamp) and his two followers (Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran) were caught and placed in a glass prison for eternity. In present day, whilst saving Paris, Superman inadvertently sets them free and they set about conquering the planet.There feels like a large amount which can be said about ""Superman II"". With weak acting, moments of excessive patriotism and plot elements which are forever laughable, the film has so much wrong with it that months could be spent writing a list. Ironically though, it really is the finest of the four Superman movies.Whilst awkward acting performances by the main bad guys is unique to this one particular episode of the series, the lame performances by Gene Hackman, Reeves and Margo Kidder are all regulars throughout the series.The excessive patriotism is a familiar theme throughout the series too. In this feature, we even have Superman flying through the air carrying the stars and stripes. This blatant moment of American patriotism, along with the President of America speaking for the world, is infuriating and simultaneously annoying. This problem is still a regular through all four films though.Out of all of the comic book heroes, Superman is always the most annoying. Even worse than the awkward looking Ironman, Superman always feels like a sign that people really are stupid. The reasoning behind this is that whilst any superhero who has an alternative life normally wears a mask of some sort, Superman puts some glasses on. It just has always smacked of being far-fetched. If you see a familiar face walking down the street, you might say to yourself that they have new glasses, but you'd know who they are. For the people who know Superman's alias Clark Kent to never actually notice that he's just Superman wearing glasses, pretending to be clumsy, it's absurd.Anyway, rant aside, the Superman series of films are pathetic by modern standards. Whilst clever in special effect and design in the time they were made, nowadays they feel awkward and rough. These are a set of films which could possibly do with a huge makeover, but the question is why anyone would want to.""Superman II"" is by far and a way the best of the series. Sadly though this doesn't mean much. It's like choosing between death by injection or death by medieval torture. Just because one is considerably better than the other doesn't mean it's any less of an awful choice. If you must watch one of the series, choose this one, but ultimately your better off watching none of them.",Superman II

It is reported that director Richard Donner began to shoot Superman 2 when he was replaced mid-way through with Richard Lester (whose directing was okay for this, but appalling for Superman 3 because of his over-emphasis on slapstick). However, at least in this film, the script is still very strong and great villains which are only seen for a few minutes in the first film make a great appearance - especially Terence Stamp as General Zod.

Aside from it's corny moments, it was a compelling start to the superhero genre in Hollywood history. So, when it became a box office success, a sequel was made and was met with a positive reception. I saw it with my brother on a DVD copy and while it's not as fresh as the original Superman, it's a pretty good sequel. It may be a little bit long and it's tone shifting is very uneven, but those flaws are outweighed by it's best aspects.The story is fine and I liked how it shows the emotion of Clark Kent when he chooses not to be Superman anymore. The dialog is pretty good and it's well-paced. The music from John Williams (accompanied by Ken Thorne) is superb, the scenery is magnificent, and the direction from Richard Lester is above-decent as are the special effects, but the best part would have to go to the cast. Christopher Reeves did a great job once again as Superman, Terence Stamp did great as the sinister villain General Zod and Gene Hackman is rock solid as Lex Luthor.Overall, Superman II isn't as fresh as the original, but like I said before, it's a pretty good sequel to the classic and is worth-recommending.",Superman II

The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the heroes and villains. Some poignant sequences for a dark tale, whilst not being depressing. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods -- and truth isn't found. Reeves' is not the restrained performance that the critics have described.",Superman II

The whole story is really lame, the acting below par from all involved, and overall, this one isn't even up to the (also lame) first film. I can't say I saw anything in this one to redeem it in any way. LAME!",Superman II
102,FloatingOpera7,The Best Of Christopher Reeve's Superman Films,10,9 April 2006,"Cast: Christopher Reeves, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Sarah Douglas, Jack O'Halloran, Valerie Perrine, E.G. Marshall, Terence Stamp, Music by John Williams, 1980 This, for me, is the most engaging of the Superman films which starred the late Christopher Reeves (died October 10th, 2004). Recently his wife also lost her battle with cancer and died. Reeves is the spitting image of the classic comic book legend Superman, and he lives the role, taking it as seriously as any role he took. He was physically fit, in his prime and able to perform stunts and fights. The story picks up where Superman Part One (1978) left off. Superman is distracted by his love for journalist Loise Lane (Margot Kidder) who eventually discovers that her co-worker in the Daily Sun paper reporter Clark Kent is actually Superman since mysteriously he is never around when Superman saves the day. Archenemy Lex Luthor and a gang of alien terrorists with super powers threaten to dominate the earth and it's up to Superman to save the world. But there is more. He has lost his powers, giving them up for his love of Louise Lane, as he wishes to live as a mortal with her. Can Superman rise to the ocassion and defeat the baddies ? With music by John Williams, who was at his most productive as a film composer in the 70's (Jaws, Star Wars, etc), this film is gorgeous to look at and is thrilling and full of magic and danger. But it really only appeals to the young at heart, fans of Superman or fans of science fiction adventure. This story is moving to me, even more so than Superman I. There is lots to admire in the special effects which were new at the time, in the fine acting (including Gene Hackman as the villainous Luther, Ned Beatty and Jack O'Halloran). Interesting note: Chris Reeves was also filming ""Somewhere In Time"" with Jane Seymour, a love story, and took the cast to see the premiere of Superman II as it is explained in the DVD bonus features. He was being considered a romantic icon since in both films he falls deeply in love. Check it out, rent it, own it, experience Superman II.",Superman II
103,Prichards12345,Good Sequel,7,16 May 2010,"It's certainly campy - even the Donner version has the camp laid on pretty thickly, but Superman II was entertaining at the time it was made and has held up pretty well today. Chris Reeve was a great Superman, and here he has his hands full after being pitched up against three Kryptonian super-villains who have the same powers he has, a Lois Lane growing increasingly suspicious of Clark Kent's sudden disappearances whenever the Man Of Steel shows up and an escaped Lex Luthor out to get even.Having now seen the Donner version twice I think I like parts of both versions - the Eiffel Tower atom bomb sequence never worked for me, though Donners film also has more strained humour between Lex and his cohorts. The ending of the Donner film is also a complete fudge, though the tone is more even and the scenes between Reeve and Marlon Brando are fascinating to watch after all this time. Terence Stamp is a hoot as General Zod, and Sarah Douglas is a great vampy Ursa. When I compare the chemistry between Reeve and Kidder, and the zero interest Brandon Routh-Kate Bosworth relationship in Superman Returns, there's no contest, really. Gene Hackman gets better and funnier dialogue this time out as Luthor - I also much prefer his showing to Kevin Spacey's.The highlight of the film is the action duel between Superman and The Kryptonian renegades. It's exciting, splendid stuff, and it's worthwhile to remember there was no template out there at the time for superhero battles. It also manages to develop the story rather than being just all out action, as Zod comes to realise that Superman cares for the human race and can use this compassion as a weapon.Superman II may not have the epic feel of the first movie but it certainly is a fun entertaining ride, and who can resist Clark Kent's unexpected return to the diner? Certainly not me!",Superman II
104,Hayden-86055,Wow,9,1 January 2021,"What a film! Definitely one of, if not my favourite superhero film ever. Christopher Reeve is the definitive Superman and Clark Kent and Margot Kidder the best Lois Lane. Additionally, the plot of this film is spot on a lot more fun than the original and we get both Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the great Terence Stamp playing the villainous General Zod. What makes this film so much fun is that the villains all have the same powers as Superman but are complete opposites, every interaction they have with him is perfect and their moralities clash deliciously, as well as their physical fights obviously.Special effects wise it is quite dated but that just adds to the fun for me, it doesn't need expensive CGI to work and it's a lot nicer to watch than Man of Steel in my opinion. The practical effects and sets are really well done for the time.9/10: Highly absorbing and entertaining",Superman II
105,timdalton007,Nearly As Good As The First Film,7,16 November 2006,"Following the success of Superman The Movie, Superman II picked up where the first film left off. And despite the firing of director Richard Donner & Editor Stuart Baird, the deaths of cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth & production designer John Barry, and the unavailability of composer John Williams, director Richard Lester and the rest of the cast and crew still make Superman II a splendid film. Indeed, Superman II nearly equals the first film in terms of story and entertainment value.Christopher Reeve proved he was the Man of Steel in Superman The Movie and here he improves upon the role. Reeve has some great moments as Superman during the films opening sequence in Paris and later during the more romantic scenes with Lois. Reeve proves to be exceptional in the films action sequences and, as in the first film, Reeve makes you want to believe a man can fly. As Clark Kent, Reeve also does well especially in the diner, his return to the Fortress of Solitude to regain his powers, and in the final scene in the Daily Planet. All in all Reeves' improves in the role and would continue to do so. Margot Kidder, like Reeve, improves in her role as Lois Lane. Her Lois is full of spunk and its fun to watch the chemistry between the two. She also handles the emotional scenes very well especially during the Niagara Falls hotel scene where Clark is forced to reveal that he is in fact Superman. Kidder is arguably at her best as Lois and considering her lack of appearance in the following two films, this is probably the definitive performance of any actress as Lois.The rest of the cast lives up to the standards they set in the first film. Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor and while his role is reduced, he still manages to bring humor and menace to every scene he's in and he remains a delight to watch. Jackie Cooper and Mark McClure return in their roles of Perry White and Jimmy Olson, respectively, and do very well considering their limited appearances. The same can be said of Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine in their roles as Luthor's dimwitted Hench-people. E.G. Marshall does well in his brief appearance as the President. Clifton James returns in a role more appropriate for his J.D. Pepper character from the 007 films and he seems out of place in this film. Susannah York appears once again as Superman's mother and her scenes in the Fortress during the lead up to the depowering scene are at times touching to watch, though it would probably have been better if Marlon Brando had appeared as originally planned.But the film really belongs to three other people besides Reeve and Kidder: Sarah Douglas, Jack O'Halloran and Terence Stamp as the villains from krypton. Stamp has a lot of menace and screen presence and is highly believable in the role of evil General Zod. Sarah Douglas brings menace to the role of Ursa and one never doubts her ability to kill someone. Jack O'Halloran's Non is also a great character and is at times menacing despite being used for comic relief every so often. Together they form one of the best groups of villains ever put on film.The films writing isn't as good as that of the first film, but the films story is somewhat of an improvement over the original films. One has to keep in mind that Donner had shot a large amount of material for the film that in is this film (specifically the scenes with Hackman, the Moon attack, and White House surrender) and that Lester had to film new material to bridge the sequences together so that he would get his credit for director (long story believe me). Despite the obvious tone differences, the footage shot by Donner and Lester are edited together into a seamless film. While at times the film is too campy during the Houston, Idaho sequence and during the insert shots during the battle over Metropolis, the film has a sense of both seriousness and fun that at times lacked in the first film. The romance between Lois and Superman/Clark is especially well handled and serves as a high point of the film.The special effects are hit and miss at times. The flying sequences are well done most of the time but there is some obvious use of dolls during some sequences that serve as a bit of an annoyance. The scene on the Moon is especially well done in terms of special effects as is the de-powering scene in the Fortress. Overall the special effects aren't quite as good as those in the first film but they're still good enough.The music of the film is a bit of a disappointment. John Williams proved to be unavailable to do the score and composer Ken Thorne was brought in to do the music. Instead of creating an original score and infusing elements of the original Williams score, he simply rehashes it. The effect is an overall disappointing score that seems to fit the scenes of the original film throughout. For better or worse, this film has a Ken Thorne score and exactly how good or bad his rehash of the Williams music is has been, and will be, a matter of debate.Overall, Superman II is an enjoyable film. While at time too campy at times and suffering from a bad rehash of the first films score, this film still has many things going for it. With grand performances from the leads, good performances from the supporting cast, great villains, a well handled love story and a nice mixing of two director's visions this film is one of the best Superhero films there is. While not as good as Superman The Movie, this film deserves a high ranking in terms of best Superman films out there.",Superman II

That's how you would describe Superman II. The sequel, unlike the first, has far more action and entertainment, and that's what makes it so popular and a favourite for many. Actually, the action starts right from the beginning, and it set the tone for the rest of the film. That should tell you all you need to know about Superman II. The character, Superman, unlike the first, has an even more greater challenge posed to him. In this movie, he encounters three memorable villains with the leader being General Zod, who happens to originally be one of Superman's greatest foes. It's the villains of this film which makes it so memorable. Most people are not familiar seeing Superman taking on someone else for a change, but this movie does a lot to change that, and it worked. The great thing about Superman II is just how entertaining it is from start to finish, and no wonder it's many favourite Superman movie to date.

111,raypdaley182,"Hmm, plot?",2,17 September 2006,"This is pretty dire.The opening credits is basically a complete recap of Superman The Motion Picture. And they go on way too damn long for my liking.Now why Zod, Ursa & Non curse Kal-el is beyond me. You never see him at the trial and he seems to have nothing to do with their crime, their trial or their punishment. The nuke freeing them is a bit of a really rubbish plot device.The little boy who falls down Niagra falls, this is a massive goof. He falls for 27 seconds (I counted, twice to make sure) before Superman catches him. I still say falling at terminal velocity he'd have drowned before Superman even got his cape on.The little boy in East Houston has a really good English accent for an American. Oh, and the RPG fired at Non would have still exploded before he bent it, most likely as he held it in his hands.Lois's line ""I'm going to change into something more comfortable"" is pointless. All she has with her is the clothes on her back and the handbag. Unless Superman is a closet transvestite? The President Of The USA is a funny man, saying he's trying to protect the people of the world. Funniest joke in the film. How did Clark and Lois get back from The Fortress Of Solitude and where did they get the car from? Despite being told by his mother that losing his powers is a one way thing Clark still tries to go back to being Superman. It's impossible. But why he doesn't think of using Kryptonite against the 3 criminals? He's an idiot. We're never told how does get his powers back either.And even though his journey to The Fortress Of Solitude as a mortal must have taken him a long time he still has bruises and cuts on his face from the bar fight against the truck driver.Why does Lex Luthor think the 3 Kryptonian criminals will have heard of him. And he has nothing to offer them at all. They should have killed him right away. Oh, and Luthor is bald at the start of the movie, how did he grow so much hair so quickly? What was with all the masonry falling outside the Daily Planet, Zod, Ursa & Non only flew through windows, they didn't smash through any walls so that's quite a big continuity goof. I did spot the reversed ""No Entry"" sign as well, this time.How we're expected to believe Superman can ever beat these 3? He's outnumbered. Yes, they haven't had their powers as long as him but they seemed to have MORE powers and different ones he didn't have either.The off-camera comedy ""noises"" fight with Non is totally ridiculous. Oh, and is it me or is Ursa's voice treated by a synthesizer in some way? And ""They've killed Superman! Let's go get 'em"" what the hell does this mortal think they can do to 3 Kryptonians? The matte behind them as their blowing is really bad and very obvious as well.The dubbed British accents saying ""He chickened out"" and ""Superman didn't do nothing"" were very funny. I guess only Britsh Actors were available for ADR? Lois is a very bad passenger with Non, despite having taken many flights with Superman. I found that odd. Good goof.Now what's the finger beam that Zod and Ursa use? Superman has never displayed that power. Or the ability to disappear. Until this film of course. How did Luthor know what activated the molecule chamber? Superman never told him, and it's unlikely he found that information on his previous very short trip to The Fortress Of Solitude.I guess we're left to assume that once Zod, Ursa & Non lost their powers and fell in the crevasse they froze to death? There isn't much rubble or mess in The Daily Planet offices after the huge smashing it took. Lois said ""I don't even know what to call you"" even though Lex and Zod both clearly called him Kal-el in The Fortress Of Solitude?Clark going back to teach the trucker a lesson is wrong. Superman is all about right, and revenge no matter how it's meted out is never right. Even if he did pay for the damage.The silly frozen fountains on The White House lawns just summed up this movie. Poor, with no attention to details.",Superman II
112,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: showing its age, skip it",4,13 April 2002,"I enjoyed the ""Superman"" movies when I was a kid, but I caught ""Superman II"" recently and unfortunately, I cannot recommend it. I think a lot of reviewers are relying on their memories, while I believe that reviews should relate to the modern era, since after all that's when people are making decisions about what movie to rent.Let's face it, the original Superman concept was sort of nutty to begin with. A guy who has X-Ray vision? Comic book fare back in the 1940s was sub-intellectual, for sure. So the character really needed a modernizing clean up (see the comic novel, ""The Dark Knight Returns"") and the Superman movies failed to do this. Adding some super badguys doesn't help, because special effects and action have come a long way since 1980. And a little romance doesn't save the film, because the characters are too cardboard to really cherish.Finally, the film just makes no sense. Several new powers are added -- invisibility, levitation, strange beams from the Kryptonian fingers. There's even a kind of nutty hypnosis, in what is surely a deus ex machina that's very unclean at the end of the film. There is a lot of inappropriate violence presented as comedy, and it's a little goofy and just sucks the believability out of the film. At one point Superman picks a fight with a trucker for no reason. Without spoiling the plot, I can tell you that what happens to the badguys in the end didn't fit the Superman personality for me.I admit it -- I'm an action movie flick guy who hates arty film reviewers whining about how Arnold Schwartzenegger movies don't have good character depth. But take my word for it, I still thought it was bad. Superman I is worth seeing though.Who should see this film:-- nobody. You will be tempted to relive your childhood if you saw it long ago, but what if you try to relive it and discover it was not so good in the first place?(Note: keep those memories sancrosanct by also avoiding seeing any re-runs of the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" TV show)I'll give ""Superman II"" a generous 4 out of 10.",Superman II

If you remember the scene where Lois jumped into the Niagra Falls and Clark had to save her without revealing his identity... that was not in the film. It is a shame because I love that scene. Instead, Lois shoots Clark to prove he is Superman. There are also a few more scenes cut out and replaced with other scenes. It is very interesting to see a different version of the film. But I have great memories of watching this film when I was a kid so I prefer the original version.The action is great, the acting is great and the story is great.

114,Ali_John_Catterall,If it ain't broke,8,19 November 2009,"According to Super-lore, director Richard Donner had completed around two-thirds of Superman II before executive producers the Salkind brothers, citing spiraling budgets, replaced him with former co-producer Richard Lester, the man who shot the Beatles in Help! and A Hard Day's Night and made The Three Musketeers. Says Donner, ""I got a telegram that said, 'Your services are no longer needed.'"" Thus, prior to its belated DVD release in 2006, Donner's alternate, less ""campy"" and supposedly darker cut (with added Marlon Brando) assumed a near-mythical status among fanboys and girls, whose tireless campaigning contributed to its revival. But was it worth resurrecting?With the benefit of hindsight, the maligned Lester has been done a disservice. Today, even Donner admits of his version, ""I would never shoot like that now in a million years."" Criticisms focus on the jarring restructuring; a muddled recap, a less dramatic opening, and a ludicrous ending.In this age of Youtube, fans are now attempting their own edits, trying to reconcile both directors' visions. But why bother? With the exception of some missing Brando, Lester's film is much the best film in the initial quadrilogy. If it ain't broke and all that.",Superman II

But it's also not worse than the original, either. It's a pretty direct continuation of the original and serves as material for a nice double-feature mini movie marathon. This movie is exactly on par with the original in terms of quality.
Perhaps it's the higher stakes Superman has against him that causes people to view this as the best Superman movie. It's unclear.
Whereas the first movie focused on a man with superhuman powers saving the world, this is a movie about a conflicted man whose love interest is quickly - and blatantly - beginning to realize his identity and who is willing to be with her no matter what the cost may be.The continuity between the two movies was a nice touch, and this was a highly fun and entertaining movie.",Superman II
116,Al_The_Strange,"""Come to me, son of Jor-El! Kneel before Zod!!""",8,12 June 2013,"Originally, the 1978 film Superman was designed to be shot and released back-to-back with its immediate sequel. With the rivalry between the producer and director, things didn't work out that way, but Superman II still saw the light of day. The vast majority of it is still Richard Donner's work, but since the man was fired before he could finish it, Richard Lester stepped in to fill in the gaps.As a result, Superman II continues in the same general tone and quality as the first film, but with more of everything. With General Zod and his henchmen as superpowered villains wreaking havoc across the US, the spectacle is pretty darn cool; some of the most thrilling scenes include an epic battle across Metropolis, in which all the superpowered characters duel and cause mass destruction. Plenty of other interesting scenes, including fun sequences in Paris and Niagara Falls, keep the film evenly-entertaining.However, the film also has a lot of campy comedy, which can come off as being really silly (I blame a lot of it on Richard Lester's additions to the film). Once again, the film hasn't aged all that gracefully, so the special effects and production looks rather cheap and gaudy. Compared to the first film, this sequel doesn't quite have the same emotional punch or epic-scale ambition either.The story, however, covers some interesting ground. Characters remain charming as ever, but it gets really interesting when Superman faces the challenge of maintaining his secret identity, and makes the drastic decision to abandon his powers to experience human mortality and pain. The story is even more solid with Richard Donner's cut, which connects more thematically with the first film.This film has solid photography and editing. Christopher Reeve is still great as Superman, while Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and other major players return to provide more of the same as before. Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran are wickedly fun as the villains. Writing is okay. This production uses okay-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. The film uses a few exotic locales to give the film a slightly bigger scope. The music score employs most of the same themes that were composed in the first film.The film's theatrical cut is generally enjoyable as it is, but Richard Donner's cut has been assembled for DVD and Blu-Ray, and it is a totally different experience. Using a combination of existing footage, screen tests, and original special effects, this version of the film cuts out a lot of the silly comedy, re-arranges the plot, and adds in so much more to the story and characters. I personally prefer and recommend that version of the movie, for it is a stronger storytelling experience (even if it is slapped together with raw materials).Either version comes recommended for anybody wanting more of Superman.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)",Superman II
117,mcfly-31,Super-film!,8,4 July 2002,"My problem with the first film was pacing. Boy, did they improve on that here. Right out of the box Superman is finding himself in that usual predicament of rescuing Lois Lane, as he zips to France in a very effective opening for the film. Little does he realize (by hurtling an elevator(!) into space) that he has cracked ""The Phantom Zone"", a sort of floating window that houses three super-villains who were banned from his home planet of Krypton in the opening of the first movie. They are released and head for Earth to cause chaos for no apparent reason, which was one of my few problems with the film. Stamp and his two cohorts can pretty much do what they want to who, so why bother taking over the whole country? So they can...what? I mean, the guy can walk into any bar and order a free drink forever. Kinda falls under that old axium, what do you get the man who has everything? But, never mind. It's one of those things you don't need to think about. Along with the silly moment where a boy from Houston, Idaho speaks with a British accent (the movie was made in England). That one gets overlooked more easily because it provided a small laugh at the same time. Anywho, a terrific plot device is thrown in, as while the three wackos are tearing up the southwest, Reeve has been unmasked (or uncaped) by Kidder, and the two begin a romance far from the trouble. At one point Reeve even gives up his powers so that he may love an earthling. Right about this time he discovers Stamp on the television demanding Superman appear before him. Supes has been left in a desensitizing chamber and Reeve must decide to give up Lois or stay with her and watch the world crumble. It sets up a great ending as Reeve reappears to do what he can to save Metropolis. I so much more enjoyed this second go-round because there seemed to be more drama and a sense of urgency. If you think about it, this is the only Superman film where he has to fight other human beings. Having more hand to hand combat was so much more effective than doing battle with missiles and rockets like in the other installments. Director Lester is just as good as Donner, and the same can be said for Thorne who picks up for John Williams on the score.And like the first film, the effects still look great, with a fantastic Niagra Falls rescue (my favorite moment in any of the films) and nice visuals during the Metropolis finale. The cast repeats their fine talents of part one, and the entire film stands out as the best in the series for me.",Superman II

119,charchuk,Far cry from the original,3,16 July 2006,"Way too campy for my tastes and a far cry from the original. While that one wasn't afraid of taking itself seriously and presenting Superman as a straight drama, this one attempts to take the campy route and it ultimately fails. It's painfully clear that there were two directors on this film, as Donner's scenes are very similar to the original and Lester's are the ones that veer into camp. It's also very clear which ones are better, and makes me wonder why they fired Donner at all. It'll be interesting to see his cut of the film. Overall, a very disappointing sequel.The story itself is very interesting, though unfortunately executed rather poorly. Again, it is obvious that the editors did a big hack job on the film, as characters disappear for long stretches of time (e.g. Lex Luthor) and there is never any sense of danger present, like in the first one. The romantic scenes with Superman and Lois Lane drag on to the point of boredom, and the only thing that saves the film from being a complete waste is the three supervillains who begin ruling the planet, especially General Zod. His cold evil is a nice contrast to Lex's dark sense of humour. The final battle is okay, but ultimately ruined by some poorly placed comedy that just doesn't work. And the climax is rushed and makes no sense. Very poorly plotted.As expected with a film as campy as this, the acting isn't that good. Reeve does his best, but it's obvious that he know the dialogue is terrible - especially when he almost starts laughing during a dramatic moment. Hackman apparently didn't even shoot this film, so his scenes are stock footage combined with a stand-in and a (terrible) impersonator. It's actually hilarious to hear half of Luthor's lines spoken by a voice that sounds nothing like Hackman's. Stamp is great as Zod, and his two sidekicks are decent, but that's about it. Kidder is slightly less annoying but still terrible, and no one else even has enough screen time to make an impact.The special effects are a slight improvement over the first, but nothing spectacular; the editing is absolutely terrible; the music is a poor rendition of Williams' original; and the production design is poor. All in all, an unworthy sequel to the fantastic original, and just not a very good film all-around. Disappointing.",Superman II
120,theshadow908,Pretty good sequel.,7,1 July 2006,"Superman II tells the story of three Kryptonian criminals that Superman's father Jor-El once imprisoned, escaping and landing on the planet Earth, discovering that they have all the powers Superman has. The three of them team up with Lex Luthor to take Superman down. The only problem is that he's missing. He's given up his powers as Superman so he can live a normal life with Lois Lane. Now, as the world is in danger or destruction, Superman must sort out what his priorities are. Though not as good as the first film, Superman II is highly entertaining and packs a good punch.Richard Donner managed to turn the first Superman film into an iconic smash hit. He was well on his way to turning Superman II into an even bigger hit, but due to artistic differences between him and the producers, he was fired and replaced at the last minute. I can't help but think Superman II would be on a par with the first film if Donner had stayed on board. However, a lot of his ideas and footage still remained, so Superman II manages to have the same serious yet funny style that made the first film so good. I liked how this movie gave Superman an actual threat rather than just Luthor, a regular guy with brains, though I like the character. The action scenes are just as fun, and the dramatic scenes flow just as well.Christopher Reeve does a blowout job as Clark Kent/Superman once again, and Gene Hackman is hilarious once again as Lex Luthor. Terence Stamp was kind of corny at times in the role of General Zod, but overall he was cool.Overall, though Superman II isn't as great as the first film, it still manages to flow along the same lines, and for that, I like it.7/10",Superman II
121,RiffRaffMcKinley,"A step down and an insult, but still somehow good",7,14 April 2007,"Why does no one ever think of Richard Donner as a great director? He was-- his works include both ""Ladyhawke"" and ""Superman."" The fact that he was fired from this movie is one of the most infuriating facts in motion picture history. That being said, the Lester cut is not *bad*. It is a step down in quality from the first ""Superman"" movie, but it is incredibly fun to watch Superman meet his match-- no less than three times! The three Kryptonian bad guys (Terence Stamp as Zod, Sarah Douglas as Ursa, and Jack O'Halloran as the mute Non) add a dimension Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor couldn't quite reach. And while the Paris situation early in the movie is artistically nonsensical, it is a great chance to see Lois Lane in action... until she screams. However, you can only consider your ""Superman II"" experience complete until you have seen the Richard Donner Cut.",Superman II
122,kgprophet,Best of the Superhero Movies,7,5 May 2012,"This is a review for the original theatrical release of Superman 2, as opposed to the recent Richard Donner cut. I vividly recall leaving the theatre in an adrenaline rush after seeing this film when I was about 16. The tag line for this franchise was ""You'll believe a man can fly"", and I wished more than any other time in my life that I was a superhero. Richard Donner was probably the basis of Jackie Cooper's character of the cranky editor (stolen with no shame in the recent Spiderman series), a fatherly figure with a great sense of humour. It is sad that he was fired from the film, but his fingerprints are all over the finished product, and he still should be proud of his work.This is one of my favourite superhero movies of all time. For my tastes, this film delivers a perfect blend of action, wonder, humour, and romance. There is nothing wrong with Superman 1, and it is perfect as an origin movie. But Superman 2 is driven by the terrific Terrance Stamp as General Zod, already setup in the first film, along with the engaging Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. The film leaps into a memorable set piece, placing our damsel in distress beneath a hydrogen bomb sitting atop the Eiffel tower. This cleverly ties into our trio of villains as they knock around some astronauts on the moon. Before you know it, you are already 30 minutes into the film as the chemistry between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder keeps a smile on your face during their visit to Niagra Falls.The script gives Reeve great one-liners, who seems to be a natural at playing a super geek. Although we re-visit the fortress of solitude from the first film, the meaning and the impact of this powerful place are explored to a fascinating degree in this film. Marlon Brando originally was the face seen when a crystal of knowledge was played back, but it is only a minor concession to see the teaching given by Susannah York instead.",Superman II
123,mmallon4,Kneel Before Perfection,10,23 March 2016,"Due to the complex and troubled production behind Superman II it seems more likely for it to have been a disaster of a film, yet despite of this I consider Superman II to be the perfect Superman film. While I enjoy the first film, I find Superman II improves on it in so many ways, delivering a more emotionally satisfying film. A rare instance of the perfect combination of cast and crew coming together to create something wonderful. I do feel on the whole Richard Lester is a better director than Richard Donner and after seeing Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut I thought to myself ""thank God Donner was fired from this production"". The romance between Lois and Clark is very forced and underdeveloped; there is a lack of humor, and no exaggeration, one of the absolute worst endings I've ever seen. I'll stick with the Richard Lester version.The actors of all the Christopher Reeve era Superman films have such a great dynamic together that even in a movie as poor as Superman IV I can still enjoy their interactions. Especially the scenes in the Daily Planet offices have such energy to them and even contains a bit of that His Girl Friday feeling to them with Christopher Reeve having a bit of that Cary Grant to his acting DNA; plus you know an actor is perfect for a role when I find myself accidentally referring to the actor as Clark Kent and not Christopher Reeve. But if there's anyone who steals the show its Terrance Stamp as General Zod. One of those performances which bring me eternal levels of respect to an actor. Every one of his beautiful hammed up, menacing lines I could listen to all day.The wonderfully kitsch special effects of Superman II just get better with age; give me these charmingly fake effects over eyesore CGI any day (ok I'll try and avoid a CGI rant). Likewise the 3rd Rock From the Sun type humor such as Zod and his minions mistaking Earth's name as planet Houston to the visual comedy (Zod walking on water) has some big laughs (as well as that humorous use of product placement during a fight scene for Marlboro Cigarettes and then Coca-Cola only a few seconds later amuses me).Many people will say Superman is a boring superhero, what tosh! A guy who makes the world a better place for others who can't enjoy his own life and has to work with the woman he's madly in love with, but can't profess it to her. If that's that tragic then I don't know what is. Speaking of romance, that is perhaps my favourite aspect of Superman II; the romance between Lois and Clark is perfect. I so badly wanted to see these two get together, two down to earth souls who are too perfect for each other. Margot Kidder's voice is so emotive and she has that Margaret Sullavan like quality to her. At the film's most intense romantic moments her tearful pleas kill me.",Superman II
124,GeorgeRoots,A Decent Follow Up In Light Of Circumstances.,7,7 September 2014,"When Richard Donner had finished direction of the first movie, he had completed over 81% of photography for the intended sequel. However, tensions rose over creative control between Donner and the studio, so they got Richard Lester to take control over the second film (Even Lester widely regards ""Superman"" is and always will be Donner's story). Lester shot 51% of the movie, along with rewrites of Donner's work which they both worked on. Richard Lester's version was very well received, and with the release of ""Superman Returns"" in 2006 Warner Bros. released ""Superman 2: The Richard Donner Cut"", restoring 80% of Donner's footage. The response of course was that Donner's movie has been obviously regarded as the superior film. I've yet to see it personally, but I thought I'd just bring that knowledge up to those who are fans of the series.""Superman 2"" is a great sequel in the ""Superman"" franchise, that in some areas succeeds over the first movie in terms of action. General Zod is portrayed by Terrance Stamp, and Stamp's performance seems to lack the emotion gravitas of what you'd think from a power hungry tyrant. Nevertheless he does a good job, but personally I myself would have wanted a bit more of an enthusiastic performance. I also love that there's also a lot more of a fight in this movie, but it's not spectacular in any way and half the time it feels like a giant advertisement. Superman gets smacked into a Marlboro cigarette's truck, Zod is hilariously chucked into a giant neon Coca Cola installation. It knows what it is and has fun with it, and I can respect that in this kind of film.But by far the weirdest part for me is when Superman decides to become ""human"". I know it's a sign of love and loyalty towards Lois, and it raises the age old question of why Superman can't copulate with her etc. But the fact it reduces him into something weaker and even less than human makes me wonder why he would own such a device. The strengths of what makes Superman appealing is partly his own instincts, therefore his nature. For whatever reason, I just didn't think much of it other than to include a silly ""I can't fight them"" excuse for the third act. Either way, Richard Lester did a very good job with the movie. It obviously continues the story strongly and Christopher Reeve, along with everyone else is as wonderful as ever. But the big question will always remain why was Richard Lester asked to do this? Final Verdict: After saying everything that needs to be said, both versions of this film have made a successful sequel nonetheless. I enjoyed it, and personally cannot wait to see the ""Donner Cut"". 7/10.",Superman II
125,Thrashman88,A Serious Drop In Quality...,6,19 November 2007,"I saw SUPERMAN II when it premiered, back in the summer of 1981. I was just 13 years old and remember to fully enjoy the picture. However, as years passed by and having seen the film yesterday, my feelings for the film have changed somewhat. Firstly, there is a serious drop in quality compared to the original, SUPERMAN, THE MOVIE, which I think still holds up rather well in this day and age of CGI wizardry. There's a sheen of ""cheapness"" stamped all over the frames of SUPERMAN II; the film itself lacks the lively colors and stunning cinematography of the first one. From the watered down music score (which uses the most familiar material composed by John Williams, but sounds like its being performed by a Junior High band!), to the useless comic relief, to the mostly garage-sale special effects, this sequel could have been so much more. The story itself sounds very interesting: Superman decides to dedicate his life to his true love, Lois Lane, and give up his powers. Yet, at the very same time, the three villains Superman's dad imprisoned back in Krypton escape from the phantom zone and plan to take over the Earth. The situation puts Superman in an awkward position: should he stay with the love of his life or should he save the world from its greatest menace yet. I must admit, the core of the story is really good, and because it is so good it infuriates me even more to see such potential rendered as a half baked sequel. And what ever happened to Lois Lane! She looks dreadful is most of her scenes. She looks like she's suffering from anorexia or something like that. Only on one scene does she look well groomed and pretty (the diner fight scene). And we never really know just ""HOW"" Superman regained all his super powers after supposedly losing them for good(after all, his mother tells him that, in order to live life with an earth girl, he must dispose of his super powers). Superman appears later on fighting the bad guys as if nothing had happened. Sure, this kind of ""script freedom"" was similar to the ""turning earth backwards"" ploy used in the first film. Using this type of ""creative device"" again only adds insult to injury.All in all, SUPERMAN II is not all that bad. The actions sequences are rather OK and overall, the film is still fun to watch (despite some very cheapo looking effects). But SUPERMAN II's biggest asset is that it was the basis for the much more superior SUPERMAN RETURNS, in which Brian Singer effectively links his movie to the events of SUPERMAN II, and the only way to TRULY enjoy SUPERMAN RETURNS is to revisit SUPERMAN II.I haven't seen Richard Donner's cut. My guess is that it's a case of of ""too little, too late"", since Richard Lester's cut IS the definitive SUPERMAN II sequel (I'm sure if Donner had done it, it would've been immensely superior... too bad he didn't have it his way). Despite all its flaws, SUPERMAN II is (along with SUPERMAN RETURNS) the best sequel the original movie has.",Superman II

127,jpintar,Better than the original,10,27 June 2004,"Superman II is that rarity.  The sequel that surpasses the original in quality.  Like The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, X Men 2 and Toy Story 2, Superman II does not simply repeat the first film like too many sequels tend to do.  It advances the characters and develops them more.  In Superman II, Clark Kent and Lois Lane strengthen their relationship.  However, the three super villains from Krypton show up on Earth determined to rule the Earth. Superman must choose between his love for Lois and his duty to protect the world.  The three villains are not just standard comic book villains (unlike Nuclear Man in Superman IV).  General Zod as played by Terrence Stamp is an evil man who do anything it takes to rule the world.  He doesn't care who he has to kill to fulfill his thirst.  That is why he is one of the great movie villains.  I'd take him over the campy Batman villains any day.  Watch this movie along with the original and you will have a great time.  10/10",Superman II
128,stormhawk2021,Great continuation and the best of the saga,10,4 September 2018,"Sincerely the one who has done the criticism that is first by votes in this film in my opinion makes a fool of himself with his conclusions. If I tried to look nice with the subject of when I was seven and now that I'm thirty-something so I know that it has been confused as a movie. Superman II the director's montage (Richard Donner) is a film as good as the first, as simple as that. If there are some things that are missing from the ""Lesterian"" version, we'll see the ""Ultimate Edition"" Theatrical version and point, and if we want to see the real continuation of Superman I, we'll see this film that is the Richard Donner montage . Movies must be seen with desire, not arrogance. Blessed is childhood. Movies do not have to be idealized either, they are what they are, an entertainment, no matter how good they are. Seriously, the topic of when I was seven and now that I'm a mature guy, does not strain anymore. What happens that the movies also bore when you see them many times, you have to take that into account to make a constructive criticism. I think the best way to go through life is with optimism, so you'll see things without so much prejudice, yes, when a movie is bad, bad stays, and everyone has their tastes. So if the first one says it's bad, then he's there, but for me it's good enough. Gene Hackman is certain that he seemed older or, at least, as old as young as really old, but he is an act, so it seems to me that he shows the intentions of the critic to whom the only thing that occurs to him to comment on Gene Hackman is his physical appearance, because neither has absolute grace nor, much less, the slightest idea. The first two parts of Superman are good and you have to see, because it is practically the same director, they were shot practically at the same time and have the same cast. The continuations are degenerating the saga.",Superman II
129,mardalsfossen01,Almost as bad as the first one,3,15 February 2019,"'Superman II' still is mostly superficial, cheesy, barely logical, people only accept it because it's 'Superman'.The writing and production is a bit better than in Part I, but it still is bad. It's hard to bear watching through a lot of it, besides the scenes including the new characters, they actually are somewhat entertaining. Christopher Reeve still is a legend and fits the role.
There's so many good movies in history of mankind, even in the 70's and 80's, but they don't make it easy to count this as one of them.",Superman II
130,illbebackreviews,Superman II is such a fun action adventure movie!,9,22 March 2013,"I can't praise enough how much I love this movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the 1978 Superman movie. So this review, I will have to compare these two films.'Superman II' focuses once more around Clark Kent whose love affair with Louis Lane isn't going too well until she eventually finds out that Clark is Superman and is willing to marry him. In order to marry a mortal, Clark must give up his power and become a mortal. All the while, Clark is unaware that three Kryptonian criminals that were locked up by Jor-El have escaped following an event at the very beginning of the play and plan to make chaos across Earth whilst finding Jor-El's son, Ka'El, Superman! The acting in this movie is better than it was in the original. Christopher Reve was fantastic in the movie and provided some truly hilarious moments. His constant transition between a socially awkward newspaper reporter and the Man of Steel was hilarious and truly drove the film along. The woman playing Lois, I thought did a better job in this one than the first. Terence Stamp was great as Zod.The way Superman II starts with Clark realizing that some terrorists have taken over Paris and are planning to blow up is priceless, where he quotes ""That's terrible!"" only for his boss to casually reply, ""That's why they're called terrorists"". From that moment on, I was glued to my seat.Everything to me is superior here than in the original, except one thing. The acting was better, the visuals had slightly improved, the story was far better, the villain was better and the action sequences here actually were quite entertaining, despite being made in 1980. I loved how this movie managed to bring villains from Ka-El's home planet instead of having some criminal mastermind who barely did anything that truly excited or truly gave any suspense. In the first film, Lex Luthor is so lightly focused on and when his plans really come, they are so rushed. Here, the three criminals are given plenty more screen time and are funny, they are dangerous and more like superhero villains.There is so much that happens in this movie over 2 hours, that when it was over, I was disappointed that it wasn't a little longer. Everything in this film was entertaining and more importantly, done well from Lois trying to expose Clark's truly identity, to the criminals taking over Houston, to Clark giving up his power for Lois. There was so much good in this movie. The action was good, much better than any in Superman (1978). The only thing I truly found better in the original was how they did Superman's origin story and how he came to Earth....That, and of course the ever so legendary Marlon Brando's performance of Jor-El.At the time of its release, it was the greatest superhero movie and until Nolan's Batman trilogy came, I think that it truly deserves to be the greatest superhero film. 'Superman II' is truly adventurous, hilarious, exciting and engaging.",Superman II
131,antagonist117,"Superman II squanders its potential, raising interesting questions but providing no answers",4,6 March 2014,"The first ""Superman"" was a pretty silly movie, but a lot of that was attributable to the goofy stooge played by Ned Beatty. ""Superman II"" dumps Beatty early on, but instead of getting more serious as a result, everything else becomes dumber to compensate. The movie starts off with a long series of clips from the original, and recycled footage continues to pop up here and there, padding out the 2+ hour runtime. The trio of baddies headed by General ""Kneel Before"" Zod are actually pretty cool in a B-movie sort of way, with their struts and their Cirque du Soleil costumes. Following their reintroduction in an imaginative scene on the moon, the first half of ""Superman II"" sees some truly unexpected plot twists involving Lois Lane and Superman's relationship. These developments raise some interesting questions about the nature of Superman, and for a while it seems as if the franchise may take off in a bold and fresh new direction. At the midway point, a hologram of Superman's mother (Susannah York) underlines the absolute irreversibility of a decision by stepping out of her holographic projection crystal. This step feels momentous, and it pays off when Clark Kent visits a diner and gets thrown through a glass door in a bloody and sad scene underscored by shots of the desolate, frozen landscape outside. After that, though, things go rapidly downhill. All too soon, and without any real explanation or subsequent acknowledgment, the irrevocable decision is revoked and forgotten. An explanatory featuring Marlon Brando, Superman's father from the first film, was in fact filmed, but was cut due in part to a change of director midway through production. Since the scene was never replaced, the chance to develop the mythos and characters was lost, and throughout the second half of ""Superman II"" an offhanded silliness reigns. Sheriff J.W. Pepper (Clifton James), a cartoon character from two of the worst James Bond movies, had already shown up early on for no purpose, and although he disappears after a couple of scenes the tone he sets continues throughout the final act. The four invincible, flying aliens toss cars around Metropolis while onlookers and a hammy Gene Hackman crack lame jokes. The action hops to the Fortress of Solitude, but there are no real stakes to it now that the film has backed away from the precipice. The conclusion is cheaply-won and dissatisfying, and as the credits role another silly Superman movie starts to evaporate from the mind.",Superman II
132,rparham,Superman II delivers the goods,8,22 June 2006,"Supeman II is that rare breed: a sequel that, mostly, matches it's predecessor in terms of quality. Some even believe that Superman II is actually superior to Superman, but I tend to disagree, I think Superman has the edge. Nonetheless, Superman II is an excellent sequel to Superman and a great entertainment on it's own terms.Superman II picks up almost immediately after the close of Superman. Terrorists have taken hostages on the Eiffel Tower and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) is, unsurprisingly, in the thick of it. Enter Superman (Christopher Reeve) to save her and send a bomb the terrorists planted in an elevator into the depths of space. When it detonates, it shatters the Kryptonian prison the Phantom Zone, which contains three criminals from Krypton, General Zod (Terrence Stamp), Nod (Jack O'Halloran) and Ursa (Sarah Douglas). As they are now in range of Earth, they have the same powers as Superman, but not his moral code: they are interested not in helping the citizens of Earth, but conquering them.Meanwhile, Clark Kent, Superman's alter ego, is sent with Lois to Niagra Falls to write an expose for the Daily Planet, and after a series of mishaps, Clark finds himself revealing to Lois his secret identity, and the two begin a love affair. Superman consults the image of his mother, Lara (Susanna York) in the Fortress of Solitude's records and uses her counsel to make a decision to give up his powers and live as human so he can love a human. After he makes this fateful decision, the Kryptonian villains begin their rampage of Earth, eventually capturing the White House. With the assistance of Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) who has escaped from prison, they begin seeking out Superman. When Superman learns of this, he returns to the Fortress with the hope of regaining his powers and saving Earth, but he may be too late.Superman II takes many of the developments of Superman to the next level. The principal element that is expanded upon is the romance between Superman and Lois which is a central element of Superman II. The relationship is strong and there is a definite chemistry between Reeve and Kidder as they discover that each loves the other and how much they are willing to give up for the other. The scene where Superman renounces his powers for Lois is powerful and moving. There is genuine depth to this element of the story. There is also a strong sense of drama to Superman's decision to give up his abilities for the woman he loves: what is more important, his duty to the world, or the feelings of his heart? Superman II also benefits from the strength of the new villainous trio of Zod, Nod and Ursa. As good as Gene Hackman was in Superman as Lex Luthor, he was just human and therefore not a complete match for the Man of Steel. Here, it is difficult for Superman to face off against his adversaries and know if he is going to come out on top or not. The villains add a greater sense of danger to Superman II.Even with all the good stuff on display, Superman II does have some weaker elements. Superman was directed by Richard Donner who was also contracted to shoot Superman II. The two films were designed to be made back to back, and Donner had shot a lion's share of Superman II's material, but had a falling out with producers and was not asked to complete Superman II. Richard Lester stepped in and finished the film, and it is the documented different material that makes up the disparity of quality in the film. Superman II dips occasionally into some sillier and campier moments, more brazen comedy, not the chuckle inducing self-reference of the first film. There is nothing detrimental here, but a few hints of what would cripple the future sequels.Once again, the actor deliver the film. Without strong performances from Reeve or Kidder, this film would fall flat on it's face, but they deliver magnificently. They make you believe in the relationship and so you believe in the film. Hackman is back in a smaller capacity as Luthor, but he still delivers the goods. Stamp, O'Halloran and Douglas are effective as the new villains, and manage to provide an appropriate amount of menace to the film.On the whole, Superman II is a superior sequel when most of the time filmmakers going for round two manage to completely fumble the ball. Superman II is well worth your time and still stands as a great comic book adaptation.",Superman II
133,Old Joe,The adventure continue,9,31 January 2001,"Superman II takes off from where the first movie ends. Action from start to finish. This movie was made two years after the original and maintains the standard which continues the story of one of the world's greatest superheroes.Superman II begins with Superman foiling the plans of terrorists setting a hydrogen bomb in Paris. After getting rid of the bomb, Superman takes it far into deep space. It explodes and the bomb also allows three of Krypton's worst criminals to escape. Once they reach earth they vow to take over. If anything or anyone gets in their way, there will be a high price to pay. These mean creatures have the same powers as Superman. Meanwhile Superman and Lois Lane realise that they are falling in love and have a passionate love affair. The price for this is that the man of Steel has to relinquish his powers. So can superman save the earth from the evil criminals from Krypton or is he gone forever?Continuing on the role of Superman is the talented actor Christopher Reeve. It was a real treat to watch him again. His acting ability really comes out here. Whether he trying to act like Clark Kent or Superman, it looks as if he isn't even trying. He really is a genius. Then we have the role of General Zod, played by Terence Stamp. It is was a role which needed someone who could act as if he didn't care and again they found the right man for this role. Whether his accomplices were as good, in my view is debatable. Then we have Margot Kidder. In her early years, she was an attractive looking woman and perfectly scripted in the role of Lois Lane. Actually, the whole love affair part of this film was quite touching and leaves the audience wondering whether the man of steel is gone forever or not. Last but not least I must commend the role of Lex Luthor once again. Of course I am talking about Gene Hackman. He really is great as Lex Luthor. The scene where Luthor tries to bargain with the 3 evil Kryptonians at the Whitehouse was great.Many sequels in my view are done for the hell of it. Yet this film is one of the exceptions to that rule. I say some of the credit for this needs to go director Richard Donner. Even though he isn't credited as being part of the directing force behind Superman II, he was. Yet he mustn't have wanted anyone to know about it. I certainly didn't. Donner's influence certainly helped the final product. My favourite scene was when Superman tackled the three evil villains in Metropolis. This scene has action from start to finish and has the Donner presence in it also.The storyline of Superman II was also well done, and the credit for this needs to go to Mario Puzo. It was fascinating, well written and also able to follow the first movie perfectly. I would love to read the book of this film considering the way that it was bought to the big screen. So if you loved Superman, hire the sequel and get swept up with an excellent follow up movie. Up Up and Away!!!!!!Rating: 4 out of 5 stars or 8.5/10",Superman II
134,dormesher-21565,A fantastic sequel,9,20 January 2019,"Superman 2. A great sequel and I prefer this to the original this is my second favourite live action Superman movie and just has some great iconic moments.Zod is a fantastic villain and Terrance Stamp plays him to perfection and no one plays him better and no one has sinse in my personal opinion.
The action is dated but for the time still looks brillaint and Christopher Reeve plays Superman perfectly again he is Superman and anyone who argues is just wrong it's that simple.The score again is fantastic and really is the Superman theme song it's just so iconic.
I also love how this sequel follows on from the original because in the first one we see Zod and the other Kryptonians get put the Phantom Zone and it's great how this one answers what that scene is all about.The final act action is just amazing Superman and still one of my favourite moments in the Man of Steel's legacy the final fight is amazing and the last scene in the Fortress is incredible the way superman reverses the device that takes away powers and takes the villains powers away is just awesome and a scene that always makes me smile.I will admit the scene where he throws the S and at Zod is just silly and I've never understood it.Favourite moment is at the end of the movie where he gets revenge of the guy beat him up when he didn't have is powers he throws him across the bar and just says I've been working out that's just classic Superman.Verdict 9.1/10 great sequel with a great villain and action some silly moments and dated but again just a nostalgic movie",Superman II
135,Sober-Friend,Good But I prefer to watch the Restored International Cut,9,23 June 2017,"This film is very controversial. Mainly because ""Superman"" and ""Superman 2"" were both being shot at the same time. When production fell behind schedule Richard Donner stop filming the scenes for ""Superman II"" and concentrated on filming the scenes for ""Superman 1"". When Donner was ready to finish work on ""Superman II"" he was fired. Now why he was fired is up for grabs. Truth be told everything with Gene Hackman is ""His Footage"". Richard Lester ended up being the director of record for ""Superman II"". The 1981 film is still a good film. 25 years later Warner Brothers released ""Superman II"" the Richard Donner cut and it is good but the restored International Cut is actually the best cut of the film. It re-incorporated many scenes that were shot by Richard Donner. In fact the balcony scene in the international cut is much better than the scene that Donner used in his cut. Both scenes however were shot by him. In this film the three villain from Krypton have now found there way to earth and they are taking over the world with a little help from Lex Luther. At the same time Lois Lane is out to find out if Clark is really ""Superman"". This film has more action than the first film but it doesn't have the heart but its not meant too. Its meant to be an action adventure film and succeeds. THis version (RESTORED INTERNATIONAL CUT) is not available to buy but you can download it. I just wish the Richard Donner would have used more of the Lester Footage to so his cut did not seem so jumpy. Trust me must comic book films today are terrible when compared to ""Superman"" and ""Superman II""",Superman II
136,axlrhodes,A great comic book adventure.,10,1 June 2008,Superman II is an outstanding comic book film that manages to harness all the fun of Superman:The Movie while keeping the serious undertone started by the first film.The Kryptonian villains are back and the film is much more exciting than the first film for having them around.The production of the film was troubled by the dismissal of Richard Donner but in fairness his replacement Richard Lester managed to finish the film well under the circumstances.Christopher Reeve is once again in great form in the title role and is complemented superbly by Terrence Stamp in the role of the main villain.Gene Hackman provides some laughs while Margot Kidder and Sarah Douglas give feisty watchable performances that lift this film up as a great example of how a comic book movie should look and feel.The music is awesome too thanks to Ken Thornes recreation of John Williams timeless score.,Superman II
137,wildlife-ptech,Entertaining sequel,8,16 October 2019,Rating8/10Entertaining sequel continues the story but has more comic elements. Effects are dated but still watchable. Climactic fight still engrosses. Despite some odd tonal shifts it's worth watching.,Superman II
138,kingofdanerds,Had more fun with this film than the original film,9,13 June 2021,"We have all heard of films having troubled productions. Instances where directors are sacked and new directors are brought in and there come about two versions of a film. A good example would be Justice League and The Snyder Cut. But another movie based on a DC character already done that way before. Superman II was for a while, filmed during the original Superman of 1978's filming. Richard Donner was director at the time and you guessed it, was fired and a new director named Richard Lester. In 2006, a new version of Superman II came out and is known as The Donner Cut. (Note: I have not yet seen this version but hopefully when I do, I will most certainly have a review of it up). With all that trouble going on, Superman II was released in 1980 and was yet another critical and financial success. The film stars Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Margot Kidder, Valerie Perrine, Susannah York, and Terence Stamp.Superman saves the day by taking a bomb into space and letting it detonate. But little does he know, the explosion causes three imprisoned criminals from the planet Krypton are broken free from their prison and come to Earth to come and take over. All of this is going on as Superman struggles with hiding his secret identity and yearning to become more human.This film, without a doubt, is better than the original 1978 film. I just have much more fun with this film than the original. This film seems to expand upon the romance between Lois and Clark, throwing in conflicts with identity and being human which really make things much more interesting. Also the conflict involving General Zod and his cohorts added in just make for a great viewing experience. I think the villains here, General Zod and co., are better adversaries than just plain old Lex Luthor. Seeing villains that have the same exact powers and outnumber Superman is just far more interesting. General Zod himself looks evil and acts as well. Take a look at some of the scenes after they are released from their imprisonment. There are great scenes of just these villains causing havoc and chaos. This all makes for an overall serious tone. But, there are comedic bits thrown in and for me, I like it. I get a laugh from a vast majority of the jokes here and this film's comedy is not something like Superman III if you know what I mean. The acting overall is plain fantastic. Everyone does well in their respective roles. The highlight performances come from Reeve as Superman and Stamp as General Zod. No explanation needed. When it came to the original's special effects, I was positive for the most part. What I was negative about was that there are some obvious cheap looking shots. Well, most of the effects are believable with the occasional flying effect that looks fake. Luckily, those flying effects are not used as much and the film is able to offer many more effects than the flying effects. Last thing to mention is the music. Now, John Williams score is fantastic when it comes to the original, and despite him not actually composing the music here (his music was still used), I think the music here in Superman II is just as good if not better. Maybe since this film goes for a more action tone, the music seems to fit perfect.Superman II for me is an improvement to a minorly flawed superhero classic. For sure, the best of all the Superman films out there.",Superman II
139,David_Frames,"""Is there no-one on this planet to even challenge me?!""",7,11 November 2006,"Arguably the best of the Super-flicks with Reeve reprising the title role amiss all sorts of the backstage disruption. Fans will know that whatever the credits say this is Richard Donner's film, albeit modified a touch by replacement director Dick Lester. Usually a change of face behind the camera can make for an uneven spectacle, witness for hotch potch that is Casino Royale (1967) for example, but the miracle of Superman II is that it's coherent, tightly focused stuff  the changes in tone between the martyred Donner and his less talented successor barely notable amongst the movie's many pleasures.Of course it would have been hard for Lester to ruin the second film when the bulk of it had been done nearly 18 months previously. It would be like you building your own home from scratch, adding all the fixtures and fittings and then having a heart attack only for the bloke who did the painting and guttering while you were hospital taking credit for the finished abode. In light of this ""directed by Richard Lester"" may be the most spiteful credit in Hollywood historysome would say even on the movies he did direct himself. Its all down to the Salkinds of course, those Icelandic loonies who could be thankful that the man they hated had done all the groundwork, effectively guaranteeing the sequel's success prior to completion. Everything memorable in this Superman is his doing  the tender scenes between Lois and Clarke, the climatic fight between Terrance Stamp's General Zod, Ursa and Non and the man of steel and the fortress of solitude end game  all played straight using Donner's mantra of dramatic integrity over weightless camp. All of this begs the question of what Lester actually did to earn his director's credit? Not enough would be a fair answer and the real director could and should have sued the super-arse off all concerned.Memorable for many reasons, not least Stamp's scene chewing performance - ""Kneel before Zod!"" has entered the lexicon of popular culture as much as Kryptonite and the red cape; Superman II succeeds in developing the relationship between Reeve and Kidder while effortlessly extending the first film's epic reach. Yes, you can feel the quality as well as the width with this one. There's almost nothing wrong with it but if we have to nickpick and we do, Brando's backstage greed saps the re-worked opening of its significance as Jor-El is not present thus the 'punish the son of our gaoler' angle that explains Zod's hatred of Superman seems forced and would Supes really go back and kick the bar brawler's backside at the end? I'm glad he did but it feels naughty, Superman having a self-indulgent moment  mind you it is consistent with the overall theme of dispatching bullies both alien and domestic that fills the film's last half-hour. A great sequel all told as well as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of romancing some girl while the world is being destroyed by intergalactic super-criminals, but even as audiences sat down to enjoy it they had no idea that the source of its success had already been shown the door long before it had hit the cinemas. It would take another three years and Richard Pryor before the consequences of the Salkind's actions became clear  a destructive force in Super-terms that General Zod could only have dreamt about: Superman III  the producers crushing the audience's hand for a full two hours.",Superman II
140,Gideon24,A sequel that actually improves upon the original.,8,7 March 2015,"One of the very rare examples of a sequel surpassing the original was the 1980 epic Superman II.Director Richard Lester has mounted an edge-of-your-seat adventure that pretty much begins where the 1978 film left off. The opening credits appear over clips from the first film for anyone who might have missed it or needed a reminder of what happened.The intricate screenplay effortlessly weaves together two basic stories. The first involves three super criminals with super powers from the planet Krypton, who were imprisoned for life at the beginning of the first film by Jo-rel, Superman's father, who escape from their interplanetary prison and vow revenge on Jo-rel by going after his son. The other story, which is the one we had been wishing for at the end of the first film, revolved around Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) FINALLY learning that Superman and Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) are the same person and his reveal that the only way he can actually be with Lois is to give up his Superman identity and his powers, which is exactly what he does, the timing of which is unfortunate as the three super criminals from Krypton are methodically destroying planet earth in their quest to find Superman.This film is so effectively constructed because it captures the spirit of the original film without rehashing or altering what happened in the first film. The story introduces new characters who bring a variety of comedic and dramatic layers to the story, from a redneck sheriff, hilariously portrayed by Clifton James, to Krypton's, General Zod, played with bone-chilling intensity by Terrence Stamp, who actually ends up teaming up with Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) in his quest to find Superman.And despite the expensive production values that are clearly present throughout this film, it is still the endearing and endlessly charming work by Christopher Reeve as Superman and especially the powerless but in love Clark Kent, that makes this film even more fun to watch than the original.",Superman II
141,carologletree,An Inferior but More Than Worthy Sequel,8,27 February 2016,"The original ""Superman"" was revolutionary and set the bar pretty high. This sequel is nowhere near as good, but it's still great on it's own right and a worthy continuation of the Superman story.The film isn't nearly as well-paced as the first film and the special effects are even more dated. Also, the humor, while not as over-the-top as in the 3rd and 4th films, can occasionally be too cheesy. However, there isn't much else to complain about.Christopher Reeve is still magical in the role of Superman, and Margot Kidder is also great as Lois Lane. I love that this film further explored their relationship.Zod, Ursa, and Non are really fun villains, and their battles with Superman are very exciting and epic. We also get the return of Gene Hackman's spot-on portrayal of Lex Luthor.The legendary music score by John Williams is as invigorating as ever, and the sets are once again great.It doesn't hold a candle to the first film, but it's still a more than worthy follow-up. It's a shame that this was the last ""Superman"" film that was any good.RATING: B+",Superman II
142,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,Thank Zod for Terence Stamp,6,16 June 2013,"It is true that one can't expect a Superman film to have a particularly plausible plot. However, it would be a huge understatement to say that Superman II lacks in the suspension of disbelief department. The film is so full of plot holes, what-the-hell moments and unexplained (also inexplicable) decisions on the part of its characters that it's fairly obvious no one bothered with the script. The writer didn't even try to explain to any convincing degree why Superman decides to lose his powers, how he got them back after explicitly stating he can't actually do that, etc. I'm not referring to stuff like the Kryptonians happening to end up on Earth - this is Superman's universe and you just go along with such coincidences, although I wonder if it was necessary to have his mother declaring that the prisoners can be freed by a ""nuclear explosion in space"" - it simply sounds funny.So all in all, the plot borders on the ridiculous - but still, the film is worth watching. Why? Because in all its goofiness, it has a great asset: the commanding presence of Terence Stamp, whose portrayal of General Zod easily earns him a place in a list of the most badass villains in film history. A feat all the more admirable considering he has quite little to work on, and a BDSM costume to do it with. Next to that, his henchmen, Ursa and Non, are doing their part to save the film, along with Christopher Reeve who proves again that he was perfect for the role of Superman. So by the end, you will probably be disappointed with the result, but I can promise you will feel a strong urge to kneel before Zod.",Superman II
143,Ibuk,Superman 2 - the super sequel,9,28 October 2007,"In my opinion Superman 2 surpassed Superman 1. For one thing in Superman 1 they took almost an hour explaining the origins of Superman. Secondly the ending could have been more thrilling. Now back to Superman 2. Gene Hackman returned as Superman's arch nemeses Lex Luthor. On top of that there were three villains from outer space, who create absolute havoc in Metropolis. I see this movie as two parts,the first being The Clark Kent/Lois Lane love story and the second where Superman returns to take on the villains. After this movie things started to go downhill, Superman 3 was bearable, Superman 4 was torture and Superman returns was a waste of time. Everything was top notch, the scripting, the effects and much more. Superman 2 was the super sequel.",Superman II
144,joestank15,THIS is the best superhero movie in existence?,4,11 December 2005,"What a joke. Interesting story but whoever thought of the shamelessly laughable dialogue needs to be put in whatever that square dimensional prison thingy is that the villains were trapped in. My absolute favorite line is Lex Luthor's ""Superman! Thank god. I mean GET HIM!"" The rest of it is terrible. Cringe as Superman screams ""NO! THE PEOPLE!"". Cringe as Zod yells ""BOW TO ME!"" or Lois says ""You know what? You're a real pain in the heck!"" Yeesh. It's so campy it's disgraceful.One thing I'll say for it, Reeve, Hackman and Kidder manage to rise above the script for the most part. But Zod and Non are laughable villain. There are all sorts of dumb continuity lapses in the powers and strength ability. Superman doesn't even bother to take off his glasses to fire heat vision. What the hell? He can alter the course of the world's rotation and send Non flying through two skyscrapers, but flying to Paris, getting from under a bus or out of the grip of Zod is ridiculously hard. The climatic fight starts off really cool but ends terribly Watch Ursa through a manhole cover at Superman. Cool. Watch Non send Superman underground, and then we wait for a minute as we just hear grunts and groans from underground. I personally would've liked to see the fight more than people stumbling around. And then the fight ends in the worst possible way. With the baddies blowing summoning large amounts of wind with their breath. Why? So we can watch more people stumbling around. Yay. It's so corny and not funny. Just sigh worthy corny. It's disgraceful that people could consider this a good movie.SupermanII touches onto greatness a few times, but stinks of mediocrity.",Superman II

There is also a subplot involving the love Superman has for Louis Lane. The story is cool . This movie along with the first are my favorites of the series.

""Superman II"" is a film that entertains to the fullest.",Superman II
147,RCWjr,Right on par with the 1st,8,26 June 2006,"This was/is one of the few cases where the sequel to a very successful film lived up mostly to the first one. Since 70% of this is Donner's film, that isn't a surprise. This is basically just a continuation of the first film. Everyone is back with Terrance Stamp having an expanded role as Zod and he brings a tour DE force presence to the role. It was a tricky prospect to have two villains in one film, but Zod and Luther exist in the same film and bring a balance to the evil. Zod is more militarist where Luther is more opportunistic. Stamp and Hackman are in great form. With the recent release of the Donner cut of this film, this version of the film looses some of its luster. The producers and new director removed Brando due to not wanting to pay him. This changed the whole dynamics of the film. They made plenty from the first film, they should have coughed up the extra money, put differences with Donner aside and this film would have been even better than it was/is. This film really escalated the hopes of everyone that a 3rd film would be evening better. Alas, it was not to be. This is the last time, via theatrical releases, that Superman was in full glory.",Superman II
148,xbrad68,The Superman Lois Lane love story is charming,9,23 February 2006,Superman is primarily meant for teenagers. There are many people who try to hold the film to a middle aged standard and that is wrong. When I saw the movie in 1980 it was adult acompaniment 14 and under but at age 11 I made it into the theatre without adults. I met a Peoples Republic of China student named Gary who was attending Laurentian University. He started mentioning things that I mentioned in my review L'Homme du train. In that review I mentioned the Rushins and he said the Chinese were the surge ins hinting that if Russia went to war against America and its allies that China would stay neutral to avoid being nuked by either side. I call this the Kennedy Morgan Jintao new triangular diplomacy. I promised that America would never start a Nuclear War which is President Kenndys policy laid down in his peace speech of June 1963. In a previous review I mentioned President Clintons 1990 code for the nuclear war football. Apparently Clinton met with Chinese agents and told them the code so they recognized my same code as real and began to believe I was the American Shadow Vice President. I gave away no American State secrets meeting with the Chinese Spy. The Care rank Ki and Et aliens that created humans will probably not tolerate any Human alliance starting a nuclear war. Those weapons are important for safeguarding the Universe from Possibly Hostile Aliens. Stopping Global Warming will be painful but Humanity on Earth will survive I am sure. Last night I was told that America alone controls the control area of the holodeck that we are all in. Thank you and may God continue to watch over the Ki American secret Service Elizabeth Regina Alliance. Check out the other Christopher reeves movies as well.,Superman II
149,rcolgan,The first film in the decline of Superman,5,25 May 2014,"Firstly it's probably best to give a bit of background to the films development. Superman 2 was already being planned even before the first Superman movie was a success, with Richard Donner filming many scenes at the same time as the first. However, Donner fell out with the studio leading to his removal and being replaced by Richard Lester. Along with this, after Marlon Brando sued for profits from the original he was completely removed from this film, Gene Hackman did not return to film any other scenes than the one's done with Donner leaving his role in the film incomplete and many of the cast and crew did not like the directors changes causing great tension on set. All these weaknesses in production led to the great disappointment that is Superman 2. It is a weaker sequel in every sense with its bad writing, poor directing and is in my opinion the first of the films leading to the decline of Superman in the 80s.Even the story does not make that much sense for Superman betraying some of the key basis for his character. After Lois discovers Clarke Kent is Superman, Superman gives up his powers to live a normal life. Yeah, he doesn't second think himself at the time. He doesn't think of the various people who he won't be able to protect any more. All he thinks about is banging Louis. But is there really that much need for him to lose his superpowers? Couldn't he just date Lois as Clarke and just maintain his superpowers? But regardless of logic, they're happy together but then he finds out that Zod has come to earth and thus he must become Superman again to stop them.Christopher Reeve does about as well as he can do with the script he was given. There are some good Superman moments, such as watching him fly. Even with the films weaker cinematography compared to the first one, it's still iconic seeing Superman fly. But then there are some moments that push the patriotic side of him too far, like flying an American flag on to the white house. And the fact he gave up his powers and allowed many people to get killed by Zod...Then there's Luthor. Since Hackman only filmed some of his scenes, his role in the film is about as pointless as the Rhino cameo in Amazing Spiderman 2, having no real impact on the story. The only reason he's in the film is to gain sales, as demonstrated by his top billing in spite of his short screen time. And unfortunately instead of focusing on a good character like Luthor, the film instead focuses on the worst character of the films, Louis. Even in the first one she was constantly annoying and admittedly within this one then during the second half she's bearable, but there is one scene which really gets on my nerves. She begins to suspect Clarke is Superman and literally throws herself in the water just so he can save her. She is now actually throwing herself in to harms way just to get Supermans attention just like they do in Twilight! And yes, this scene is so bad that I would compare it to Twilight...Probably the best addition to the film this time round are the villains. Rather than Luthor who was decent, but had weak comedy entwined with his character there's Zod and his two henchmen. We also see how ruthless they are, putting many lives in danger just to gain the upper hand on Superman. They're also one of the few things making me chuckle in the film simply because of how they seem to present their understanding of humans. The only thing I would say against them is their flying. I'm not entirely sure whether it was their stillness or just bad directing, but unlike Superman they do not fly gracefully. Instead they seem to look more like the fish in Monty Python's Meaning of life, just hovering slowly through the air.The fights in the film and the general destruction by caused by Zod is a mixture of good and bad. Some scenes such as when the army are attacking Zod actually look pretty cool with some decent effects and Zod appearing as a very powerful figure. But then there are other times where they take you out of the moment and we see a person complaining that Zod blew off his wig. If the city was literally being torn down by 4 god like beings, then would you really be fussed about losing a wig? It's the cheap laughs like this which really cheapen the film and feel like a foreshadowing for the comedic focus of the next two sequels.It's also this comedy that is the films biggest flaw. Whilst the first remained focused on the drama and action of the story of Superman, this one focuses far too much on the comedy. Whilst it may make you chuckle at times, it's a far weaker tone to maintain such an iconic superhero as Superman and it's significant shift in tone goes against the comics and betrays the key ideals of the character stopping us from becoming invested in the character of Superman.I will state however that this is not the only version of the film. In 2006 then there was a version called the Donner Cut and contains various different scenes and is apparently significantly better, though I haven't seen it so this review is entirely based on the Lester cut and that cut is extremely poor. Other than the good villains, this film adds nothing positive to the franchise. Whilst it is not the worst Superhero film ever made, it is still a let-down after the greatness of the first film and it is in my opinion one of the more disappointing sequels trying too hard to get us to laugh and failing at almost every pun.",Superman II
150,jwpeel-1,It's a bore... it's too plain... it's Super Bad!!!,4,31 July 2004,"Dear readers.  I hate to say it might I really was p.o'd when I saw this one.  There was not much about it that I didn't hate.  The flying effects looked like guys sliding around on wires... the streets looked like studio sets and the writers should be horsewhipped for ignoring just about everything about the Superman Bible.     I didn't even like the silly story.  And I often wonder why they wasted Jimmy Olson so.  Here with a character that could have roped in a lot of teen viewers who were new to the whole Superman universe.  In fact, he even had his own comic book title. And the funny thing about it all is that I loved the next one which practically everyone else despised.  At least it was more fun than this awful mess.      The whole thing made me want to see the first one again and pretend this one didn't exist.",Superman II
151,MrBiddle,But don't they get parole?,9,10 August 2006,"Clearly a more enjoyable motion picture than SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, for reasons that it develops and directly continues what was foreshadowed and left open in the original film. I was thoroughly entertained by the charm and wit of SUPERMAN 2... From scenes of Clark and Lois in Niagra Falls, where Lois Lane finally reveals her suspicions of Clark and Superman being one, and after a terrible mishap... (caused with devious intent by Lane), Clark is told ""You were who I thought were Superman?"".The action even starts immediately, in Paris when Superman disarms a potential catastrophe, but while simultaneously, and unwittingly freeing 3 prisoners from The Phantom Zone - infuriated villains, especially Zod (played magnificently by Terence Stamp) who were jailed by Jor-El in the first movie. Lex Luthor returns with the same cynical humor as in the first film, I laughed when he said, ""But couldn't they get parole?""It is hard to distinguish the Donner scenes from those made by Lester, but nonetheless this does not make the film of lesser entertainment value, because a lot of trailer moments in here, comic relief and romance. Might I even say the performances are even better than that of the original film, Reeve portrays his Clark Kent persona with much more bungling sensitivity, and watch the darker side of Kent as he attempts to confront a bully, while stripped off of his Kryptonian powers. And Margot Kidder, gives much passion and child-like adventurosity to Lois Lane.What I didn't really like about Superman II, was one thing - the opening credits I could have done without all the recaps from the first movie, but I can assure you the salvaged John Williams theme performed by another composer is NOT ruined either but even a layman to music, like myself can discern slight alterations to the tone of the instruments, but nonetheless the new composer stays faithful; and may I just say if you want a better revival and re-use of Williams's classic scoring, it is found in SUPERMAN RETURNS. I have not seen the series 3rd and 4th installment, but it is all right as RETURNS, the movie which came out this year as well as fans choose to ignore those installments of lesser quality.Though many have found the dual-director shifting an awkward undertaking, as I have stated I could NOT tell apart the Donner scenes from the Lester-directed sequences, but the writing is just as skillful as the first film because of Mario Puzo and company, you will also find clearer exposition in this film, unless I missed it if it was in SUPERMAN THE MOVIE, in here the villains state that the molecular structure of Kryptonians are increased, thus giving them abilities aplenty because of their exposure to our Solar System's sun. In contrast, it is the rays of the sun of Krypton that can remove those powers... at least temporarily. Notice, the much darker tone of portraying the antagonists, a tone set and maintained, the three fugitives begin their reign of terror at our friends in the Lunar Excurscion Module, just when our Supes has the inclination to settle down. The conflict within is when he discovers that settling down might NOT be an option after all.Superman II is as exciting as it can get, but interestingly it does NOT have a commonplace Hollywood finale, there is denouement here and there, but watch the sentimental and almost tragic resolve to Clark/Superman and Lois Lane's relationship when our Supes is left with but one choice - thus explaining why Lane does NOT know who the man of steel really is in the movie that follows this one, NOT the 3rd and 4th installment which may rightfully be ignored, but 2006's SUPERMAN RETURNS.All in all, Superman II is a highly enjoyable treat of Saturday Matinée entertainment although my first viewing of this one in my PC was a rather ""first house"" schedule due to school... Nonetheless, those seeking a light, funny, action-packed piece with good music and some of the finest acting need no look further than this 1980 outing.",Superman II
152,moviemattb,"Enjoyable, but not the same as the first",7,7 September 2015,"Before I go into about the title that I put in my review, I want say about this first on how it all happen during the behind the scenes of the movie. While the first two ""Superman"" movies where being filmed simultaneously, Richard Donner and the Salkinds where having issues on set about going over schedule alongside with its budget as they were both going at each other's throat. So the Salkinds fired Donner after the first ""Superman"" movie being released and becoming a popular movie; they replace Donner with Richard Lester who was an uncredited producer on the first movie as he becomes the director for this sequel. Most of Donner's footage was scraped, and Marlon Brando was never included but replace by Susannah York who plays Superman's mother Lara from the first movie. Even the tone of the movie was changed into being campy with some little moments that are serious. Nevertheless, ""Superman II"" was released and became another popular movie. Does it have the same charm as the first one? Here it goes: the sequel is about General Zod and the other two Krptonians as they were prison in the Phantom Zone from the first movie are now free as they come to Earth to destroy humanity as well as Superman. Also, Lois Lane is trying to bet her life that Clark Kent is Superman. Lex Luthor escapes from prison, and the story goes on. In my opinion, ""Superman II"" really doesn't have the same charm as the first one because here is why: The tone of the movie is not balanced well enough as the majority of the movie is being taken over by its camp factor, while it has some little moments that are serious. For example, the scene were Clark Kent gets his beat up by a bully at the diner does not seem to fit for the film's tone; if its suppose to be there, then it would've made more sense if the Salkinds have not fired Donner for being kicked off the project. As for the humor, there were some parts that are funny, but mostly I find the humor to be dated. Heck, when I was watching, I see Zod making some reaction on those scenes where he just finds it ridiculous on the making this movie campy. Like where Non takes the siren off the police car, and Ursa going for an arm wrestle with a guy at the bar. You can tell that he doesn't seem to enjoy for having this movie being campy. Also, when Lester re-shot most of Donner's footage, Lois Lane's look is very much different than the way she looks from the first movie. There are some scenes where Lois looks like the way she looks from the first one, but only filmed by Donner; she doesn't look as glamorous as she is from the first movie. She sort of makes me think of Courtney Cox or something. I really don't think Lara seems to fit with the story of Superman losing his powers, because there wasn't that much of a connection between Superman and Lara as much as Superman had a connection with his father Jor-El which makes more sense than I what I'm seeing in Lester's cut. The special effects are good, but I find parts that are pretty much dated. The action in this movie was fun and all, but pretty much done in a traditional way like the first one. I do enjoy the relationship between Clark and Lois, but the last part of the movie where Clark kisses Lois by erasing her memory is like a whatever to me because I don't care if I like the memory erased kiss or turning time back in Donner's cut; it really doesn't matter to me at all. Lester's direction is fine, but it would've been better if Donner directed this movie if he wasn't fired. The acting is very well done for Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder and Terence Stamp. Stamp's performance is over the top, but really makes this character very memorable. Gene Hackman is good, but when Donner got fired, you can find some shots of him being replaced by a double as well as an impersonator for trying to sound like Hackman. Ken Thorne's music is okay, but I rather hear John Williams than Thorne. So, in my opinion, ""Superman II"" is enjoyable but not the same as first; its has moments that are good and moments that are bad. It is watchable and I have nothing to bragged about. So that is what I put the title in my review. I give it a 7 out of 10.",Superman II
153,japamo,"In ""Superman II"", the Man of Steel has a ""Spiderman Existential Moment"",",8,26 June 2012,"To its credit, ""Superman II"" continues the exploration of and challenges to both the ""Super"" and ""man"" aspects of the legendary Kryptonian. His ""Super"" part must confront three utterly ruthless, rampaging Kryptonian villains he inadvertently freed from the Phantom Zone limbo with the bomb he flung from the Eiffel Tower during the beginning of the film. Fueled by powers equal to (and maybe even surpassing) Superman's own, and by vengeance against the ""son of our jailer"", Jor-el, General Zod, Ursa, and Non prove quite a nasty handful. Complicating Superman's job, however, is an emotional and psychological dilemma facing his ""man"" persona, something I call a ""Spiderman Existential Moment"".Every so often in the Spiderman comics (and in the recent movies), Peter Parker has agonizing debates about whether he should continue as Spiderman, because playing hero denies him a normal life and constantly puts his friends and loved ones in danger. Apparently but unexpectedly, Superman as soft-spoken ""bumbler"" Clark Kent feels the same doubt about his superhero life. ""Superman II"" scores points for devoting equal time to Clark Kent, but in my opinion does not fully prepare us for his renunciation of his powers for love. Nothing leads us to suspect that he is dissatisfied or burdened by his superhero responsibilities, or by having to support a secret identity. We are asked to take it for granted. We are also asked to accept the fact that Superman/Clark Kent has harbored such secret, burning desire to be with Lois Lane for a long time. OK, OK, he did reverse time in the first ""Superman"" to resurrect her from the dead. But, and I know I might get attacked for saying this, why would anyone give up his superpowers to be with Lois Lane? I guess I was never a Lois Lane fan. Superficially, Lois is presented as an intrepid, daring, celebrated newspaper reporter. However, she's always making reckless, foolhardy mistakes that put her in danger from which only Superman can save her. Lois can also be breezingly thoughtless and cruel to fellow employees like Jimmy Olsen - and the unassuming Clark especially. And as others have said from time immemorial, if she is such a perceptive reporter, why did it take her so long to notice that Superman and Clark are one and the same? I guess Superman/Clark has a special kind of emotional, as well as physical, X-ray vision that sees something in Lois we mere mortals just can't.Well anyway, as the Kryptonian trio ravage the Earth, Superman whisks Lois off to his Fortress of Solitude, uses the crystal shards to de-power himself, and has an un-PC sexual dalliance with Ms. Lane at his Arctic home. Soon, they somehow leave the Fortress (it must have taken days without his powers) without freezing to death, find a station wagon and drive back to Metropolis. During a pit stop at a diner, a humiliating brawl with a bully makes Clark have second thoughts about his sacrifice. Clark has another ""Spiderman"" moment when he finally learns that the Kryptonian trio may soon take over, and that with great power comes great responsibilities. Better get those powers back. But wait, Jor-El and Lara had warned him that the superpower loss was irrevocable. Except when it isn't. The green crystal is the key. Clark has to trudge back thousands of freezing miles with the crystal back to the Fortress to get his mojo back. Just in time too, because the Kryptonian trio has invaded Metropolis.You know the rest: the Kryptonians have a destructive battle, the villains capture Lois, Superman retreats to his Fortress to lure the villains away and spare Metropolis more devastation, Superman tricks the villains into losing their powers, the villains fall into an icy crevasse (awaiting a sequel that never came), Superman saves Lois and gives her the ""forgetfulness kiss"", Superman promises the President of the United States that he will never desert his post again, the end.Now, now, I liked the movie very much, in spite of some inconsistencies and improbabilities (due to the checkered development history reported by other posters), because of both the dynamic action and character development, plus the interspersions of humor, drama, and even horror. But ""Superman II"" is special because it humanizes the demigod from another world and, even though it may surprise and annoy us, he is as capable of making hasty, impulsive, romantic choices as any of us. Fortunately for the world, Superman/Clark Kent learns from his mistakes.Wait, I forgot. Newly re-powered Clark revisits the diner and meets the bully again. Clark shoves the bully against a pinball machine and pays for the damage. Sweet payback. NOW it's the end.",Superman II
154,Shaolin_Apu,A Deserved Follow-Up to a Legend,9,26 January 2006,"Superman is definitely the finest and strongest and the most lovable of all the good old days action heroes. It is therefore natural that his story is not limited into one movie and great amount of the magic that the previous film has pertains into this continuation too and the Superman is greater than ever.The three criminals, who were imprisoned in the first movie at the Planet Krypton, arrived at Earth to threaten the President and make people's life difficult. Unfortunately for our present quest is the Superman currently seriously considering to leave his supernatural powers for love's sake with a woman from Earth. Luckily he takes that decision into reconsideration as the Earth happens to be again in peril.Much of the fascination of the Superman is owed to the actor Christopher Reeve. Now when he is not present anymore his character truly possess an aura that only a true superhero, and childhood's hero, has.",Superman II
155,glenn-aylett,Some sequels are as good ad the original,10,30 January 2021,"Quite often movie sequels can be poor compared with the original, but not Superman II. Yes we all know the directors changed during filming and there are differences between the two versions, but who cares, this is a seriously good film where the action never stops and the main characters are present and correct. Also Superman not only had a double dealing Lex Luthor to deal with, but the three villains from the first film who were banished from Krypton and end up on earth and have the same powers as Superman. In particular, Terence Stamp is fantastic as the evil General Zod, who wants to enslave earth with his henchmen Ursa and Non, and finds a willing collaborator in the form of Lex Luthor.Also Superman II has an interesting plot twist where Clark/ Superman falls into a fire and is unhurt and finally reveals to Lois Lane that Clark Kent is a disguise for Superman and as he wants to marry her( a human), he has to relinquish his superpowers. However, he forgets this in a Mid West diner when he stands up to an aggressive trucker and is beaten up. Meanwhile, with Superman out of action, the renegade Kryptonians rampage through America, crushing any human resistance to them and take over the White House and declare themselves rulers of Earth. Not surprisingly, Lex Luthor appears to offer his services to them in return for being offered Australia as his reward.From start to finish, Superman II is a top drawer action and superhero film, with the millions of dollars spent on the special effects and action scenes very well spent and even now, haven't dated. Again the set designs like the Fortress Of Solitude are fantastic and the final battle between Superman and his enemies, where he tricks them and they lose their power, is fantastic.I can honestly say this film is a cinematic great and well regarded now and also has a fantastic soundtrack by John Williams. Superman II was the highpoint of the series as III was OK, but was too much like a comedy and lost its edge in places, while IV was a total mess and ended the franchise.",Superman II
156,phillafella,Acceptable Sequel.,7,23 June 2003,"This entertaining sequel has the legendary Man of Steel facing three villains from Krypton, while having a love affair with Lois Lane and having to choose between two destinies.  This is a good sequel, but not as great as the original (Ain't it usually this way for sequels?).  But it's still an entertaining film with good performances and satisfying special effects.  An overachiever all the way through.4 out of 5",Superman II
157,Jerry Ables,Very easily the best film in the series,10,26 January 2004,"Superman II is my favorite film in the series because it's the most action packed of them all and it's so very exciting from start to finish.  The story was well written enough to hold your interest throughout the film and so very well acted by an all around great cast.  In my book, superhero films don't come any better than this.",Superman II
158,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Corny fun!,7,16 July 2008,"A lot of fans have turned against this entry in the Superman series because the Salkinds fired Richard Donner before he could finish the movie. Also, since Richard Lester's Superman III was less than spectacular, people have back lashed against Lester's humor. I do believe Donner would have made a better Superman II. This movie is not perfect by any means, but that does not take away its charm and appeal. Superman II wastes no time springing into action, with an exciting opening with terrorists threatening to destroy Paris with a Hydrogen bomb. Superman of course saves the day by throwing the bomb into space, but the explosion destroys the Phantom Zone, freeing the three Kryptonian villains from the first film. Superman does not find out until it is too late; he has already given up his powers to be with Lois Lane when he discovers that Zod has captured the President of the United States! Superman must decide between love and responsibility. The scheming Lex Luthor shows up to take advantage of the situation, but he's really only in this film for comic relief.Terence Stamp is the best villain in the Superman series. His General Zod is so over the top he's hilarious, but he manages to be very threatening at the same time. He is probably more comedic than Donner would have wanted but I think his character works here just fine. What really makes this movie work is the love story with Lois and Superman. Superman's decision to give up his powers is very touching in this version, whereas the Donner version portrays it as a big mistake, almost selfish. I actually prefer Donner's version of the scene but Lester's is still good. And when Superman realizes he can no longer be with Lois Lane, he handles it like a man, not like a pansy (*cough Tobey Maguire cough*).For a while Superman II was popularly known as the best Superman movie, but Superman I seems to have gained favor with the public and the critics. There are legitimate reasons to like II better, mainly for the fact that it does not take an hour to really get going. Nevertheless I think Superman II has not aged as well as Superman. The Salkinds had a tighter control over the budget and a tighter schedule, so I think many special effects were rushed. The musical score suffered greatly too. Rather than rehire John Williams to write a new score, they hired a composer to just adapt the first film's score with a smaller orchestra. The music sounds like it was performed by a high school band. Gene Hackman refused to return to film any of his scenes again, so a body double and voice over actor were cast to fill in for him. His scenes are short but they stick out like a sore thumb. Marlon Brando is also missed, especially during the recap of Zod's trial.Richard Lester's humor is more intrusive than it should be, and it would only get worse in Superman III. Donner limited the humor to Clark Kent and Lex Luthor, whereas Lester injected humor with every no name supporting character possible, like the bellhop and the police. Superman II also has one of the same flaws as the first movie: absurd powers. This time Superman can pull a cellophane S out of his chest, create holograms of himself, and give people amnesia by kissing them. Zod also has telekinesis.Still, Superman II is a lot of fun, largely due to the stellar cast. Their genuine performances really elevate what could have been a forgettable, cheesy 80's flick into something special. The Superman series influence can be felt today, especially in the Spider-Man movies.",Superman II
159,CalDexter,One of the best Sequels Ever Made......sadly with some flaws,8,12 August 2006,"Superman II was made back to back with the first film during the years 1977 to 1980. In that time the director Richard Donner was fired by the producers for creative differences and Richard Lester was brought in to mop up. Its a bit unfair then to review this sequel coming from such a troubled production.To be fair, its just as enjoyable as the first film, with the added bonus of the three Kryptonians now escaped from the 'phantom zone' and enslaving Earth with a determination to destroy Superman forever.Terence Stamp and Sarah Douglas are particularly good as General Zod and Ursa, their scenes attacking the astronauts on the moon are quite haunting and nasty. Jack o Halloran is good as the vicious bear like Non who smashes anything in his way. Their intro at the start is different from the beginning of the first film. There is no Brando present sentencing them to their fate, just a sound alike voice-over. This was one snag because Brando wanted more money for footage of himself as Jore-el, and the Salkinds refused to play ball so this hurts the opening of Superman II right away.John William's soundtrack is composed by Ken Thorne. Thorne's composure of the main theme is rather blunt for an epic blockbuster but hes spot on when the villains attack and kill the astronauts on the moon. The music is good when Lois Lane attempts to run up The Eiffel Tower to get a press scoop. The music is really good throughout the film the only flaw is that Williams should have done it himself.But then, money is what Hollywood is all about. It is why the Salkinds even bothered making the first film. Richard Donner is a great director, first and foremost he wanted to make the first and second instalment into two classic films. He succeeded with one and partially did fine with the second. If only he had completed Superman II, if only.Action packed, funny, good characters and some wonderful memorable scenes, Superman II has some flaws but it is the best sequel by far Super Again! 8 out of 10",Superman II
160,cordaro9418,"Now, kneel before Zod... and Warner Bros....",7,10 September 2008,"Well, when you saw the opening to 'Superman', you figured these three had to show up at some point, right?Originally, 'Superman II' was 'Superman'. The sequel was planned as the second half of the original, many of the scenes being shot during the original filming. But Warner's decided it ran too long and cut the film, deciding to rehash the edits and cuts into a sequel. Richard Donner, in various disagreements with management bowed out and his name was removed as director of the sequel, but make no mistake... its his film. Marlon Brando's scenes were cut due to the legalities of filming the original film and then suddenly being edited into a sequel without contractual provisions for a sequel.Minus the John Williams aspect as well, you still have a near better film than the original. No origin rehashing, no drawn out stuff, just jump right in and go. Terrance Stamp was very underrated in his role as Zod, as is Hackman in his again scene stealing Luthor role. Reeves is as Reeves was, Clark Kent (obviously Brandon Routh took some serious notes). With the introduction of 'Superman Returns' over 20 years later, this film finally has a fitting if not flawed sequel. Erase 'Superman III' and leave 'Superman IV' the aborted mess it was on the cutting room floor. Comic epic and definitely bring the popcorn.",Superman II
161,charlessmith702210,Seems like the best Superman movie of all,8,27 May 2006,"Just like Karen Lynn Gorney of ""Saturday Night Fever"" was the innocent young lady of the 1970s, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) was the innocent woman of the 1980s who falls for the famous DC comics superhero in Superman II. In addition, Margot's acting in the flick is almost the newest version of Natalie Wood....very good on the TV screen, but reluctant in the public life.Well, the costuming of the three super-terrorists in the flick was striking enough---all of them wearing black. The strong symbolization of the color black is that of darkness. This reminds me of the ""666"" analogy, but even more importantly, the dress in all black garb is akin to the Star Wars' evil character, Darth Vader.The special effects used in the messing up of New York's central Manhattan was spectacular enough. Seeing all of the New Yorkers blown away by the wind breaths of the super-terrorists reminds me of a hurricane in New York. Some of the scenes in Superman II are slight spin-offs to the earlier Star Trek movies, especially ""The Wrath of Khan.""",Superman II

163,beejer,Superman saves the world...again,7,8 January 2000,"This film which is a sequel to ""Superman"" (1978) contains a lot more action and violence and less drama than the original.In this one, the villainous trio of Zod, Ursa and Non (Terrence Stamp, Sara Douglas, Jack O'Halloran) imprisoned in the Phantom Zone in the first film, are accidently released by Superman and then proceed first to the Moon and then on to Earth to ""rule"". There unbeknownst to them Superman a fugitive from their home planet of Krypton and the son of their arch enemy Jor-el awaits.Christopher Reeve is back as Superman and his nerdy alter-ego, Clark Kent. Margot Kidder and Jackie Cooper reprise their roles as Lois Lane and Perry White. Gene Hackman repeats his role of Lex Luthor and is less over the top than in the original. Ned Beatty appears briefly as Luthor's assistant Otis, and Valerie Perrine again appears as Miss Teschmacher. E.G. Marshall, in a hilarious fright wig, has a cameo as the President of the U.S. Clifton James also appears as a comical red-necked Southern sheriff.The special effects are dazzling, and director Lester keeps the action coming. The battle between Superman and the three villains in the middle of Metropolis is superb. The two encounters with the bully at the lunch counter are also worthy of note.Superman II is an excellent action film. It's too bad that the next two installments in the series could not measure up to the first two.",Superman II
164,Tyson14,The sequel doesn't disappoint,10,16 August 2014,"Terrorists have planted an atomic bomb on the Eiffel Tower. Superman arrives in the nick of time and flings it into orbit, where it explodes. The detonation, however, sets free three Kryptonian criminals who have been languishing in the Phantom Zone, these renegades having been put there years ago by Jor-El, the father of Superman. Landing on Earth, the Kryptonians discover that the earth's sun grants them super powers. Immediately, they begin to enslave the planet. To make things worse, mastermind Lex Luthor escapes from prison and vows vengeance on Supes and joins the supervillains. Meanwhile, Daily Planet reporters Lois Lane & Clark Kent are on assignment on Niagara Falls, where Lois comes to suspect Clark of being the Man of Steel. Through a freak accident, Lois finds out she is right. Now, face to face, Lois & Clark own up to their feelings for each other. To be with Lois, Clark decides to relinquish his powers. It's not until afterwards that he becomes aware of the three supervillains from his home planet, but it's too late...With no Superman to protect our planet, it looks grim for Earthkind.This is one of those rare instances where the sequel actually is as good as the first movie. What's even more amazing is that they got it right despite all the behind-the-scenes wrangling and in-fighting that went on between producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind, director Richard Donner and actor Marlon Brando. The Salkinds had early on decided to have Superman I & II shot simultaneously. However, the filming of Superman I proved to be troublesome. Things got worse when Marlon Brando filed suit against the producers for failure to pay up on his profits from Superman I. Then, with about two thirds of Superman II having been filmed, Donner, who had issues with the Salkinds, was fired and replaced with Richard Lester. Yet, somehow, Superman II rises above its makers and succeeds as a worthy sequel and a great movie in its own right.This time, there isn't an opening half hour of foreplay with the overbearing Marlon Brando and scenes of sterile Krypton; we get right into the pertinent storyline: the release of General Zod & co. and a powerless Clark Kent in love with Lois Lane. Not as episodic as the first one, II is more consistently plot driven. Reeve and Kidder are again SUPERB in their iconic roles. The scene where Lois finds out Supe's real identity is still one of my favourite cinematic denouements. The supporting cast, with Terence Stamp (Zod), Sarah Douglas (Ursa) and Gene Hackman (Luthor) as standouts, plays it real. The only downside with the acting for me is Jack O'Halloran's Non, who is played too much for laughs.The special effects are even better than in the first Superman. While certainly not up to the standards of today's technology, they still hold up well. Remember, these effects are a quarter of a century old! Special mention goes out to the fantastic and devastating battle royale of super powers between Superman and the Phantom Zone fugitives. Also satisfying is Clark Kent's revenge on a mortal bully at the finale.",Superman II
165,the_mysteriousx,Superman's only worthy sequel,9,23 June 2003,"For those who are into the comic book movie craze today, this one is one of the best comic-y movies from the beginning of the summer blockbuster heyday. The original Superman is really an excellent film with solid, honest direction by Richard Donner. Donner shot around half of this sequel and his scenes are all excellent (Note: Every Gene Hackman scene was shot by Donner - Hackman refused to return to production after Donner was fired).There is still much hope that Donner's footage will re-surface. Most importantly of all there are vital scenes with Marlon Brando returning as Superman's father, Jor-El and giving his ""life"" to save his son and save the planet from the evil villains he vanquished from Krypton. It would also be interesting for audiences to see the difference between Donner's scenes and the ones re-shot by Lester.The characters are great. Superman, played by Christopher Reeve, is in solid form and he and Lois are given the opportunity to enhance their relationship from the original story. Jackie Cooper is once again great as Perry White, the chief editor of the Daily Planet.What makes this movie move is the villains. Gene Hackman is funnier and still up to no good and the villains from Krypton are menacing. His dialogue is truly witty and Hackman's timing is perfect. Terence Stamp is the power hungry General Zod, out for revenge against the son of Jor-El. Stamp plays it straight and his scenes directed by Donner show a true megalomaniac. Jack O'Halloran is solid as the hulking Non.Best of all is Sarah Douglas as the cold and evil Ursa in a truly underrated performance. She is the most curious and most interesting of the bunch. She collects badges as trophies for her conquering of earth, wearing them to mock male hierarchy. Ursa seems to be a forerunner of all of the sexy female superwomen today, but her role is not overstated and stale. She is not given gratuitous cleavage shots or anything of the sort. Ursa is a beautiful vamp and a tease, and if anything we wish she would have more screen time. Sarah Douglas constantly gives us hints as to Ursa's wishes, and we can only try to surmise what evil plans she is up to.The music is John Williams' score from the first film, but used differently. Not sure if much of the music is original. Ken Thorne does a good job here of accenting cuts with Williams' original score (Williams too refused to return after Donner was fired.) Some great cues are Superman returning to fight the villains, which is wonderfully heroic; Ursa's shocking appearance to both the astronauts on the moon (a violent scene that uses the darkest motifs from Krypton in the first film); and the whole Metropolis battle in the end, which is well supported by the music.The effects are very good for 1980. I keep reading how people are unhappy and always apologize for the FX in any movie more than a couple of years old. This one is solid and for the film it serves, does well. The only major goof is when Superman delivers the American Flag at the end - The water fountain in front of the White House is clearly a model with ""frozen"" bursting water! The scene in the de-powering chamber is not well-handled either.Overall, this is a very entertaining film, and really amazingly considering it is obviously the work of two directors. Of all the comic book movies made from the 60s thru the 90s, this one definitely rates in the top five along with the first Superman, the first two Batmans. Supermans 3 and 4 were really poor. It is too bad that Christopher Reeve did not make more good Superman films. This one has some camp, but it's way too entertaining and it's the only sequel to still have the flavor of the original. And please, let's see a special edition DVD with all of the missing Richard Donner footage!!!!!",Superman II

168,ryanskywalker-87402,"""Kneel before Zod""",7,18 March 2017,"Aside from its clashing tones and mismatched narrative elements, Richard Lester's ""Superman II"" is a solidly entertaining, nearly great superhero film. Its flaws may be writ large across the screen, but, thanks to an appealing leading man and some engaging notes of darkness, the action film manages to stand-out.A sequel to Richard Donner's ""Superman,"" ""Superman II"" finds Christopher Reeve's man of steel squaring off against three criminals from his homeworld. This would be plot enough, but the narrative also includes the return of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor and a subplot where Clark Kent rids himself of his immortality in order to be with Margot Kidder's Lois Lane.Less overstuffed than it is disjunct, the story rarely feels cohesive. Plot elements seem at odds with one another, never fitting into place with the next. More importantly, the tone ranges from goofy to dark with little effort made to make the different tones layer seamlessly. Fortunately, the story elements and tonal shades that do work overshadow those that do not.The sequel is a fitting complement to Donner's first film. It is a colorful, energetic work that boasts a now-iconic cast in Reeve and Terence Stamp. Action beats are strong when they do not turn to silliness, and, despite a certain cheapness that permeates some scenes, effects work is rousing. It is a grand, sometimes goofy superhero opera.A clear case of the final product being more impressive that its separate parts, ""Superman II"" makes for an impactful spectacle. At its best when it is its darkest, those more textured beats may be fleeting; but they are memorable, and those moments of thematic and cinematic urgency elevate the entire exiting action affair.",Superman II

Ever since I was a kid and saw it on TV. It is also an extremely good follow-up to the original.Christopher Reeve is back as Superman, but this time must face not one but three worthy opponents. If you remember from the original film General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and Non (Jack O'Halloran) are trapped in The Phantom Zone due to their crimes on Krypton and flying through space endlessly. Superman saves Paris by grabbing a hydrogen bomb and flinging it into space. When it explodes it opens up The Phantom Zone releasing the other three final survivors from Krypton. They also have the same powers as Superman, but are looking to rule and crush everyone under their feet. At the same time Superman is revealing himself to Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and professing his love for her unaware that General Zod is starting to take control of the world. When they learn that Superman is the son of Jor-El their jailer they want Superman to bow down before them.I must say that Reeve once again puts in a great performance as Superman/Clark Kent and he always did. To me though I love Stamp's performance as General Zod and did wonderful casting for Douglas and O'Halloran as the other evil cohorts. Gene Hackman also returns as Lex Luthor after being sprung from jail with his own ideas on how to beat Superman with the assistance of these three super-beings.Directed by Richard Lester as Richard Donner was removed from the project and did not want his name added as co-director. I have never seen the Donner version, but I think I would love to as he did seem to have the best vision of Superman and this version is just a refilming of his story. Co-written by Mario Puzo.

173,Theflyace,A Potentially Great Film Marred by Poor Moments,6,29 March 2013,"With Superman: The Movie being one of my favorite films of all time, I was naturally expecting a great movie to follow. This movie kind of hurt me in that regard. This movie is a bit uneven, the stuff that works really works, but most of the other stuff is either lackluster or downright poor.What's the story? Superman returns as does the rest of the cast from the first movie, except for Marlon Brando, but I'll get to that in the review. After Superman destroys a bomb in the Eiffel Tower in space, the three prisoners from the first movie (Zod, Ursa, and Non) are inadvertently released from their Phantom Zone prison. In he meantime, Lois Lane finds out Superman's secret identity, and he gives up his powers to be with her. Bad timing Supe! General Zod and his cronies take over the world (well we can assume that, all we see them take over is a small Texas town and the White House) But Superman does get his powers back (unexplained of course) and must beat the three super-villains.In my review for Superman, I stated that both Superman I and II were filmed at the same time under one director, Richard Donner. Unfortunately, budget and schedule overruns and clashes of approach to these films caused tensions between director Donner and the Salkinds, the producers of these films. After Superman: The Movie was released, it was a success beyond any of their expectations. But in a radical move for the cast and crew, the Salkinds fired Donner and replaced him with ""A Hard Days Night"" director Richard Lester, who had worked with the Salkinds before on ""The Three Musketeers."" There are scenes that Donner filmed that are in this movie, but the majority of them were either re-shot or added by Lester. The shift is completely noticeable.While some of the scenes are played out dramatically, most of them became ""light and comedic"" when Lester took over. There are too many dumb moments to count, the cellophane ""S"" weapon, Zod's almost prima-donna platitudes, and the stupid magic kiss to make Lois forget that Clark is Superman. No one knows how this works, and I'll never know why that works. Richard Donner had a vision of a semi-serious vision of Superman, but with grand drama and awesome spectacle. Lester, the more economical director, cuts down everything to rivets, and the special effects are pretty cheesy as a result. Not to diss Lester completely, I think he is a very competent director. The problem here is that his approach to this sort of material doesn't fit with what the material was trying to do, therefore the blend of pathos and comedy is completely uneven and for the most part doesn't work.The biggest aspect about this production is the lack of Marlon Brando as Jor-El. In an effort to save even more money, the Salkinds didn't want to hire him back and pay him more money. He is shamefully replaced by unknown Kryptonian counselors, but less so by the mother Lara. But all the things that were set up in the first movie are for naught and it's gone out the window.That's not to say there weren't good scenes. Especially the last scene between Lois and Superman/Clark is one of the best I have seen in any movie. It's very real and it deals with how Lois cant live or be with him because of his life as a superhero. He too acknowledges that he loves her but he can't stand to see her suffer. It's almost killed by the magic kiss, but it's still one of the strongest scenes in any film. Lester did very well for this.The scenes that also work, like the Lex Luthor scenes, and the scenes at the end in the Fortress of Solitude are excellent. I say excellent because these last couple scenes I have mentioned were directed by Richard Donner.Christopher Reeve is actually very good in this movie, showing the turmoil that he goes through during the story. Margot Kidder is OK, but she looks hideous in this movie (by that I mean she looks very gaunt compared to Superman I where she looks very attractive) Gene Hackman is good too, and Terence Stamp is one of the great villains of cinema.This movie is very entertaining, but when watching Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut (in my profile page) this pales in comparison. I recommend it, but only marginally.",Superman II
174,yaornw,One of the finest sequels ever made,8,17 May 2020,"Still one of the finest sequels ever made and holds up well, as does the original. The only really decent sequel during the Reed-era. Although the Donner cut is widely praised, I did not like the changes he made to the ending, where he basically used the same device as the first movie to less credible effect. I get that some dislike the super kiss memory wipe, despite the fact it is in the comic books, however obscure, but the original ending remains stronger because of its originality. The new opening is stronger as are the Marlon Brando sequences, and I liked the Ratzenberger punchline in the NASA scenes, but overall, I still prefer the Lester version because it is the one I remember, and at the time, I liked it better than the original, maybe even still do, in part because the bad guys were less comic and truly evil this round, much more menacing than Hackman's Luthor. Highly recommended regardless. YMMV",Superman II
175,Truman-10,Review of Superman II,10,13 March 1999,"SUPERMAN showed us the Man of Steel's amazing powers; now audiences wanted to see someone who could challenge him physically. Superman II delivers, but not just one superpowered bad guy, not two, but three. Add to that an escaped Lex Luthor, and the potential enslavement of the planet by the the three Kryptonian criminals from the beginning of the original, and it's DEFINITELY a job for Superman...unfortunately, he's sacrificed his powers to live with Lois Lane.So goes the storyline of this superbly exciting sequel to the 1978 blockbuster, providing all the tension and drama that movie, for all its spectacle, lacked.There's some classic scenes here. The short sequence with the three sinister supervillains silently flying through space towards Earth is incredibly ominous. The scene of a beaten up and powerless Clark Kent watching the President scream for Superman's help when he doesn't even exist anymore is incredibly dramatic and powerful....the ending scene with the double bluff finale is superb  - overall, a fantastic movie, and the best Superhero movie ever.",Superman II
176,Truman-10,A spectacular movie,10,15 March 1999,"SUPERMAN II is one of the most exiting movies of all time. The original, as good as it was, didn't exactly heap on the thrills. This sequel makes up for it - and then some. It gets down to business immediately, with supervillains coming to Earth, and builds to unbearably tense climax in Metropolis. Some of the scenes are absolute classics; the  three villains descending silently through space towards Earth is chillingly ominous; the bad guys storming the White House and confrounting the President himself; the brilliant double-bluff ending which will have you pleading, ""Oh No!!"" and then cheering ""Oh Yes!!""; the bit when it looks like it's all over, and then newspapers in the street get blown about, the farmiliar theme strikes up and we know who's back; and the best scene of all with a beaten up Clark watching the President on TV. Incredible stuff. Forget the million bullets+ finale of Face/Off, the climactic confrontation in the night time streets of Metropolis is surely the most spectacular showdown in film history, with Superman and the bad guys in a incredible battle of the titans. The action is truly astonishing - they punch each other through ENTIRE skyscrapers, and throw BUSES at each other! Almost everything in their way gets demolished - cars fly through the air and smash into each other, people get blown down the street, it's an amazing, almost orgasmically destructive scene. This film is far better than any of the other films in the series, and easily better than the legion of multi-million dollar blockbusters laden with CGI and non-existent characters. The only thing wrong with it is the poor version of the incredible theme tune, and the Clark and Lois bits are a dull. Apart from that, an absolute classic, and so damn exciting.",Superman II

178,k_g_barreto,Kneel before Zod!,7,4 December 2019,"The sequel to Superman: The Movie, a classic, is not as good as it predecessor, but it is still a good movie, one you can enjoy and like, though the movie has its problems. One thing that I didn't like at all was the 'conflict' that Superman have been trough. For some reason, he can't have his powers if he wants to live with a mortal, Lois Lane, and if he wishes to live with her, he have to abdicate his powers. It's a cool concept, but that's it. Superman decides to remove his powers without hesitating, it just happened too fast. Ok, maybe after that things escalated, but no. In less than 10 minutes, he decides to have his powers back. It's just happens TOO fast. There's no conflict. He found it easy to gave away his powers, knowing that his 'career' as a hero, a symbol of justice, would be over, and he found it easy to have his powers back, knowing that because of that he would not be possible to be with Lois, something that doesn't make sense, but ok. He didn't struggle to make those decisions. Others things that I didn't like was how easy Lois discovered Superman's identity. Yes, she's a reporter and she's smart, but it was way too quick. The lack of Lex Luthor, I liked him in the original '78 movie, but here he just appears sometimes and is a plot device, accelerating the confront between Zod and Superman. I would like to see a convicing motivation to Zod, he is the bad guy and that's it, didn't need to be like Man of Steel's Zod, but something more 'relatable'.But there's still the good things. The movie is fun as hell, I enjoyed more seeing Zod and his minions destroying everything here than in Man of Steel, released 33 years after it, with more realistic visual effects. Zod, Non and Ursa destroying everything in the Daily Planet building was a lot more fun than the megalomaniac Metropolis destruction extravaganza in Man of Steel. Reeve acting of both Clark Kent and Superman are still superb, despite the problem I mentioned earlier. Action sequences improved as well, Zod being badass in that small town, the battle between Super and Zod in Metropolis and in the Fortress of Solitude are both well made and it was good overall.Superman II can be as not as good as it predecessor, as I said the the beginning of this review, but it still a good movie, lots of fun in 2 hours, really enjoyable, with a good soundtrack, with Christopher Reeve as Superman, a good reason to watch, and a good Superman movie after all, despite its flaws.",Superman II
179,Sorpse,great sequel,8,2 March 2013,"liked this one a lot, in my opinion it was probably even better than the first one. One of the biggest reasons would probably be the villains. They are a physical match for superman so they pose more of a threat than lex luthers so called intelligence. Since supermans new villains can fly there is one really good scene of them battling it out and throwing large objects at each other and fighting while flying. The dated special effects add a cheese factor but its really fun to watch. There is also a very cool scene on the moon that felt very sci-fi like, this was a great scene i thought looked very cool. These two things were in my opinion better than anything that happened in the origonal. On the negative side though there was some pretty stupid plot elements that might be hard for some people to look passed, i personally just laughed and shrugged it off. One thing i found funny was how supermans mom tells him he can turn into a human but will never be able to regain his old powers and then he easilly gets his powers back using the green crystal, that was ridiculous, also lex luthers escape from jail in a hot air balloon was silly. Overall superman 2 is a cheesy good time i found more entertaining than the first.",Superman II

181,Dock-Ock,The Greatest Adventure in the Superman Series,10,21 May 2001,"This Superman movie has got to be the bench mark for future producers of Superman movies. They must be sat down with this film, because it is an absolute classic, and as far as Superman films go it will be hard to top. Richard Lester, is not very popular with some Superman fans, because he took over on a movie that they feel would have been better had Richard Donner been allowed to complete. But Lester has his admirers, and iam one of them. The first Superman movie tended to go along with boring philosophising, or over sentimental dramatics, these are mainly absent in Superman II,. They are replaced with cut to the action dramatics by Richard Lester who in my opinion saved the movie, or at least made it all the more exciting. I enjoy his sense of comic book adventure, and the final Times Square battle between Superman vs Zod,Non and Ursa is straight out of a comic book and is all Lesters. The main thing that complements the movie is the towering performance by Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman. Reeve is hillarious in his Cary Grant-a-like interpretation of Kent and wonderfull as a humanistic Superman. Margot Kidder is fabulous to and it is the acting of theese two that makes the Superman//Lois love triangle work. Terance Stamp as Zod is very creepy, and Sarah Douglas as Ursa very sexy, but the man who very nearly steels the show is Gene Hackman hilarious as Lex Luther. The special effects are brilliant, because they look glossy, and the Ken Thorne variation of John Williams Superman theme is at its best here. The best aspects though is the action, the aforementioned Times Square battle, and the interaction between the actors. Well done Richard Lester. A True classic of Superhero cinema.",Superman II
182,captnemo,"Could have been better than I, but misses by a mile.",4,20 October 2000,"Superman has a majestic quality to it. It has many great, quotable lines. It has great characters. There is an epic feeling to the entire film. This is a first class work by an underrated director. Everything works in this film, from the effects to the script to the acting. It is and remains a classic. Superman II had the potential to be as good or better than the first film. there are terrific scenes of mayhem and some good characters. Unfortunately, there are too many things wrong with it that drag it down well below the level of Superman. It is very sloppy and not up to the standard set by Superman. Where to begin? First, there are lots of story holes and just dumb things that happen. 1. Lois is looking for signs that Clark is Superman. They cross the street and he gets hit by a car. The car is smashed up, but she doesn't notice. Neither does anyone else. 2. A snake bites Non and he reacts as if in pain. 3. Clark gives up his powers and then hikes from the North Pole back to civilization in his suit. No sign of frostbite. 4. All of a sudden these beings have laser vision and anti-gravity vision, including Superman. No sign of either in the first film. 5. Brando is no where to be seen. He is replaced by his wife on these pre-recorded crystals. Did Reeve pick the ones that were made while his Dad was in the bathroom back on Krypton? 6. Lois has turned into a slutty, ugly person in this one. She looks awful. 7. How does Clark get his powers back when we are told that they would be gone forever?Effects miseries-1. Non punches Superman as they fly above Metropolis. The bottom half of Reeve is missing as he flies off camera. He was not matted in from the belt down. 2. Non ""trips"" over a filing cabinet in the Daily Planet building. This one is very hard to miss. He should have kicked it into orbit. 3. Ursa drops a man from the sky onto a conveniently placed mattress covered with dirt. Again very obvious. 4. The matte shots are very grainy. Everyone flying has a green ring around them. Non looks like a mannequin whenever he is shown flying. There are many more problems and they are peppered throughout the film. They make it a sloppy piece of work and not up to the first one.RATING: SUPERMAN - 10 out of 10. SUPERMAN II - 6 out of 10.",Superman II
183,TheFilmConnoisseur,You'll Believe a Man Can Fly-Again! (May Contain Spoilers),10,20 June 2003,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*Poor`Because most of the work that I try to do has a fairly firm grounding in some form of social reality from which I can take off and go in the other direction. I remember saying, `I don't know how much Lois Lane would pay for her apartment. Or how much a pair of shoes costs in Metropolis. ` That's where I normally write my gags and do my little bits, and I felt I was wrong for it. I've never had a feeling for comic books or comic strips at all.'When Richard Lester took over as director that is what he added to Superman II. There are many scenes in the film that feature social humor like the crowd witnessing the battle between Superman and the three villains as a spectator sport. And then attack the villains when they think they've murdered Superman. Another good example is the ending when Superman returns to the diner and gets revenge for the beating he received when he had lost his powers.What differs Superman II from the original is the love story. That's where Lester was strongest. The love scenes between Lois and Clark were some of the most memorable parts in this film and the performances by Christopher Reeves and Margot Kidder were once again extraordinary. And the extreme close-up of Lois Lane gives her a real beauty and makes you understand why Superman loves her. `We had a scene where Jor-El basically commits suicide, ` says Mankiewicz. `Jor-El touches his son and rejuvenates him and `kills` himself by expelling the last of his energy. That scene was as chilling as anything you'll ever see on the screen. It was shot with Brando and was wonderful, but because they [the Salkinds] would have had to pay him money, Superman says, `Mother, mother` as opposed to `Father, father, ` which is what he should have done and did do in the script. Brando appeared and said, `Even though this will extinguish what is left of my life_I warned you, I told you....` And he reached out through the void. Clark is unconscious on the ground, and it's essentially God touching the hand of Adam. It's a motif I had done at the beginning when Brando sent Chris to Earth and said, `I send them my only son. ` It was God sending Christ to Earth. Brando was just wonderful.'The first film is legendary because of it's behind the scenes battle between director Richard Donner and the producers. Both films were originally shot simultaneously but because of special effects problems Donner was forced to focus on the first film. Once it was complete go on and finish the second. However, after the dispute Donner was fired and Lester was brought in to finish the project. As a result the film lost a lot of it's epic and fantasy aspect that the first film was full of. This film had the chance to surpass the original but as a result of a lose it didn't. Regardless, the film is still full of excitement and imagination. Still one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all-times.RATING: 4 STARSQuotes available from Cinescape.",Superman II
184,konover,Great film,10,20 November 2001,"Simply put, Superman II is one of the best action/comic-oriented films of all time. I'd rank it second only to the original Superman: The Movie and only X-Men is right up there.The thing about this movie that bugs me is that I grew up watching the ABC expanded version. That's the version my dad taped for me, so for years I thought the expanded version was the only version. It wasn't until the mid-80s when I saw SII on HBO that I realized what the theatrical cut was and how much of the expanded version added to the film.
So if you ask me about Superman II expanded edition, I'd definitely rank that as the best comic oriented film all time. Hopefully, Warner Bros. will put together an interesting DVD on the film with all the supplemental footage, including the never-before-seen Marlon Brando segment that was completely removed from the picture. The making of this film was a big time headache. All of Gene Hackman's scenes were filmed by Superman I director Richard Donner, and then he was fired, and Richard Lester was brought in. So it would be really cool and really insightful if a future DVD came out on the making of the film. But I digress.The (theatrical version) film, while a bit aged, is still tremendous fun. Christopher Reeve remains the embodiment of the Man of Steel and remains a case for one example of perfect casting. He makes the whole Clark Kent/Superman thing plausible by making Kent an insecure, bumbling reporter. Terrence Stamp is also wonderfully cast as arch-villain General Zod.
The climax in Times Square is still exciting and funny. And the whole relationship between Lois and Clark/Superman is brought to the fore-front.
I'd definitely put this film as a supreme candidate for the full DVD red carpet treatment complete because the current DVD lacks big time.",Superman II

Superman 2 was far better than Superman: The Movie! Acting was top notch! I thought that Terence Stamp as General Zod was amazing! He does the voice of Jor-El on Smallville starring one of my other favorite actor's and a good friend to Christopher Reeve himself, Tom Welling, who plays Clark on Smallville. I liked the new rendition of the Superman March during the opening credits. Margot was all the more hysterical! Chris is the one and only Clark Kent and Superman for me when it comes to movies! Brandon Routh (Superman Returns,) GO AWAY! Tom Welling is wonderful as Clark (and Superman in my book) on T.V. Better than Dean Cain from Lois and Clark:The New Adventures of Superman. YUCK! Go stand next to Brandon Routh and vomit on his shoes for all I care. Christopher and Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor) are wonderful working together on the sequel. Gene is the funniest Lex Luthor and my first and foremost favorite Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum from Smallville being my second. Where as Superman Returns Kevin Spacey, after he said not to watch Gene Hackman, Dude! Go beat yourself up and leave Gene alone! overall it's a great movie! After you see this, look for Superman 3 and 4. 3 was great, especially since Annette O'Toole who plays Martha Kent on Smallville with Tom Welling, is Lana Lang in Superman 3. Gene Hackman comes back as Lex Luthor in Superman 4:The Quest For Peace. He isn't in the third film, sadly. I really didn't care for the fourth film because of the villain, (and I don't mean Lex.)

189,theojhyman,Sequel's don't get much better than this,10,22 March 2000,"The sequel to Superman: The Movie practically equals the original, one reason being, because both I and II were made at the same time, both by director Richard Donner, but who was fired in the middle of II and practically an entire new Superman II was shot by director Richard Lester. Donner deserves the credit for maintaining the reality in this sequel - the drama, the romance, the action. Lester can be credited with providing some very funny scenes (although he is the only director credited in the movie). The sequel goes straight into the action, unlike the first, but then slows down, concentrating on the romance between Clark and Lois, and Lois discovering Clark's true identity. Half the film deals with their relationship and the other half deals with the three super-villains (accidentally released from the Phantom Zone by Superman) taking over the planet. The film moves to a grand double finale, with a superb Metropolis fight scene lasting about twenty minutes and then moving on to another finale at Superman's home. Many believe the sequel to be superior to the original, but it doesn't contain that true epic quality that Superman I possessed. This is obviously because of Donner's departure (blame the producers for that), followed by John Williams' resignation and Marlon Brando's scenes being cut (that way the producers wouldn't have to add Brando's credit to the movie and pay him any percentage of the profits!). Now without them, Lester re-shoots a lot of the sequel to make it his own, replacing Donner's involving, dramatic movie with some great comic scenes and some corny scenes. Williams' score is replicated by Ken Thorne, who simply doesn't match that spectacular feeling heard in the original, and Brando's scenes replaced Susannah York (Superman's mum). There's a lot of criticism here, but let me contradict myself and say that Superman II is still one of the most entertaining and watchable movies ever made. Unlike the first, it doesn't have the pressure of having to focus on Superman's background and can therefore move straight into the action, comedy and romance. Hackman is not as good as in the first, but this is only because of the corny lines he is given to say. This movie can be enjoyed again and again, and is probably easier to watch than the first one, because it is quicker and contains more comedy. But it is just a bit too funny, and Lester doesn't give Superman the integrity that Donner knew it deserved. For such a harsh review, this movie is still brilliant and deserves 9 out of 10, compared to Superman I's 10 out of 10.",Superman II
190,Lord_Crypto,Best of the Original Superman Films,8,2 July 2007,"I have never seen the Richard Donner cut of Superman 2. I have only ever seen the Richard Lester version of the film and I will admit there are some things wrong with it, but it is an all around good film. I just wonder how better this movie would have been with Richard Donner's version.Superman 2, along with the original Superman, has a superb line of actors who play in the film. Christopher Reeves is a very good Clark Kent and Superman. He portrays the character beautifully. Margot Kidder still amazes me with how well she handles Lois Lane. She plays the stubborn and devoted journalist perfectly. Gene Hackman is a terrific Lex Luthor. He brings almost a comedic approach to the character while also keeping him a dangerous threat. He sticks true to his villainous and stylish character while adding his own personal traits to the character. Terrence Stamp, in my opinion, steals the show as the villainous General Zod! He is one of three alien life-forms who come to earth to defeat Superman and claim the planet for themselves. Stamp is an extremely serious and evil villain who captivates. He plays the character with an absolute seriousness that seems unrivaled by any other Super-villain portrayed in a film!The story is good! The three villains are wonderful! I absolutely love them! I think the entire love sequences with Lois Lane and Clark Kent are pushed along to fast! Although the story does a good job of introducing the concept of testing Supermans moral beliefs. A story focusing on the decisions of Superman and his responsibilities as a hero! Moments where Clark and Lois are talking seem just stupid though! Like when they are in the hotel, I feel almost sick to my stomach! I do not feel a good connection between them happening in this film. It happens just to fast. The action sequences are great! I absolutely love watching the three alien villains attacking the small town and the fight scenes in Metropolis! Superman 2 is a very good movie! The three alien villains is what make the movie great. Hackman, Kidder, and Reeves shine as well, but I love the villains. Their serious attitudes just establish them as very dangerous threats right from the start of the film. A great super-hero film.",Superman II
191,alfCycle,"Decent sequel, slightly below the original",6,12 May 2017,"As I stated in my Superman (1978) review, I am not really a Superman fan. I have always been a big Batman, X-Men, Spider-Man fan, but never got into Superman. I thought the original movie was decently entertaining, but not that great of a movie (see that review for more info). Superman II has elements that I liked more than the original, but also elements that I disliked more. On the positive side, I definitely liked General Zod way more than Gene Hackman's cartoonish Chairface Chippendale-esque portrayal of Lex Luthor from the first movie. Superman actually has someone to fight. However, the biggest negative has to be with the wildly inconsistent tone of the movie. This most likely comes from the change in director part way through filming. Half the movie is played with a more serious tone, whereas the other half is basically a slapstick comedy/spoof in the vein of the Adam West Batman series, though nowhere near as clever. There are also a bunch of annoying plot holes that I found hard to ignore. Mainly, how the hell did he get all the way back to the freaking Arctic without his powers? You're not telling me he hitchhiked and walked to the North Pole? And how did he actually get his powers back anyway? At least give me some dumb explanation. Not saying I'm some idiot that needs every detail fed to me, but that is a pretty big plot point. Not like this is a Stanley Kubrick / David Lynch film where you have to piece things together for yourself. At least in, say, The Dark Knight Rises, you can ""explain"" the question of how did Bruce Wayne get back into Gotham with the obligatory ""He's Batman!"", but in this movie he's not even Superman at the time, he's just some dude that gets easily beaten up at restaurants by a-hole truck drivers. Also, if Superman can erase people's minds with a kiss, does that mean he has telepathic powers like Professor X? Can he control anybody's mind? Does he need to touch them to do so? Is it strictly through oral application? Is it saliva based mind control? Couldn't he just put it in a spray gun and shoot super-mind control spit on Lex Luthor and make him rethink his life choices? Anyway, I will give this movie the same rating out of 10 that I gave the first movie, but if I had to rank them, I would put the original slightly above this one.6/10Recommended for those that enjoy ""previously on...""'s, two sided floating space ipads, exploding space elevators, hot air balloon rides, white water lie detectors, kneeling before Zod!, not so subtle product placement, the old switcharoo, mind control spit......but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Three",Superman II

Lois Lane has been sent to Paris to report on a terrorist situation, and Superman comes to the rescue, when Superman accidentally, by rescuing Lois, releases General Zod and co. they come to earth to gain supremacy.This is a hugely disappointing addition to the series, not alone is it riddled with poor effects (it even seems to have used scenes/film strips from Superman, the acting is right on the same horrible track (Stamp & Douglas are the worst) and not even Reeve or Hackman (whom both give the same level of performance as in Superman) can save this movie.

What is so amazing about this movie is that it was filmed in 1979/1980 and those special effect still hold up (even by todays standards).The great John Williams sound track is back too (actually he didn't record any music for this- they re-edited the music he recorded for the first film...none the less it still sounds great I knew when I seen those 3 villains vanquished into the phantom zone in the first film that they were going to show up again....and I was right.this film is fun. Lois figures out that Clark is Superman. Then Clark kisses her at the end of the movie and erases her memory.even the Niagra Falls stuff is fun to watch. this movie is like being a kid again.once again the acting is superb.

194,bak-67163,The first movie was better,7,9 February 2020,"Superman 2 is a good movie, but it doesn't have the same charm to it that the first one had. Most of the cast from the first movie are back in this one and give as good of a performance as they did in the last movie. Unfortunately they couldn't get Marlon Brando back as Jor-El because he was too expensive. that really hurts the movie because of what they had to cut out and what they had to put in its place. for example, in the first movie, Jor-El tried to warn to other kryptonians of Krypton's destruction, but non of them believed him. now because they couldn't shoot scenes with Jor-El those same kryptonians that didn't believe him, transferred their consciousness into the crystals. Another problem with the movie are all the silly scenes that were added in and the weird powers that were given to Superman. The movie is enjoyable though, especially any scenes with General Zod or Lex Luthor.",Superman II

196,Jemiah,It's crap - but I love it!,8,10 July 2005,"This is a superlatively awful movie directed by Richard Lester, who once was capable of such deft, witty comedies as A HARD DAY'S NIGHT... but who (un)wisely decided to camp it way, way up for the beloved, but Christopher Reeve SUPERMAN franchise. The dialogue is astonishingly bad, and the moments of cheese that were timely and pithy in 1980 seem like the howlingly embarrassing bits from an episode of ""Dobie Gillis"" - dated and squirm-inducing. ""Hey man, that's a bad out-FIT!"" Ouch. But Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder do the best they can with what they have, and things are lightened considerably by the campy chops of Sarah Douglas and the sublime Terence Stamp. When I was a kid, Superman/Clark's angst rang utterly true - in hindsight, it's almost painful to watch all the non-Krypton Kriminal bits. You better believe I watch it every time it's on cable, though.",Superman II
197,sloth47,Best threesome ever created attack Superman!!!,10,6 February 2001,"Jack O'Halloran, Sarah Douglas, and Terence Stamp produce very underrated results from this stellar film.  Terence Stamp as General Zod, O'Halloran as Non, and Douglas as Ursa join together upon their release from the Phantom Zone to wreak havok on Superman, who happens to be the son of their jailor, Jourell.  They realize they have spectacular power and move quickly over to earth to rule it as they had tried to on Krypton.  Superman has some key moves in this film.  He eye-beams a souffle for Lois to feast on and he also eye beams a branch to save Lois from Niagara Falls' rapids.  The man of steel becomes a mortal and all else seems to be going fine when Zod (Stamp) moves in and starts finger and eye beaming everyone and their mothers. Ursa eye beams a snake and Non tries to eye beam the snake, but is too retarded and fails miserably.  This film is full of good quotes, mostly all from the mouth of Zod.  He claims, (to Superman)""The son of Jourell will be my slave....forever!  If you refuse, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance!""  Kneel before Zod!!!!!  The closer we get to an atmosphere with only 1 sun, a yellow sun, the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!  There are all kinds of other classics, but I will let you discover them on your own.  Go find this film right now for an experience that will change your life forever.  I used to skip college classes to sit at home in my room with a few cold ones and watch this film over, and over, and over and over.  It never gets old and it never makes me cease laughing.

198,michael-04313,"It's a bird, it's a... oh, falling short.",7,16 July 2020,"In the 70's and 80's there were a number of sequel films which were able to become better than the first. The Empire Strikes Back and Terminator 2 are some of these films. Superman II is not. As a huge fan of Richard Donner's style of directing, it was immediately apparent from the opening credits that this was not a Donner film; Including the quality in sound of the orchestra playing the opening theme (it did not sound like John William's magic). The opening credits were a sad comparison to the first films opening sequence.The plot itself is extremely patch work in the second act, jumping between serious drama to comic villains. It was quite a pity to see Terrence Stamp have an intimidating character with with about 5 minutes of screen time from the first film, to become a dull, uninspiring antagonist. Plot holes filled the film. How did Superman regain his powers, it was not shown, only implied. The number one film rule is ""Show don't tell"". I would have preferred to be told rather than be left in the dark. One more part that I didn't understand is where all those powers came from in the final battle in the Fortress of Solitude, and how can Clark make Lois forget that he is Superman? Odd.The effects overall were not as good as the first, excluding the battle in Metropolis between Superman, Zod and his cronies. The acting was at least decent from all parties except Reeves, Kidder, and Hackman, who were as good as the first.In closing the film lacks the Richard Donner touch that was apparent in the first Superman film, and many other projects of his. Needless to say, I'm not a fan of the Salkinds... at all.",Superman II

200,dragonmysterious,Superman!,8,10 June 2013,"A Superman movie which met my expectations. Christopher Reeve and Terrence Stamp were good in their respective roles. The action scenes were well done. Most of the story is entertaining.However, I had a few problems. How did Lex chance upon the Fortress of Solitude? I don't think that any human technology would be able to pinpoint the location of an alien construct. Also, Gene Hackman still doesn't make me feel like he is Lex Luthor. Why is he still wearing a wig? Does Lex really care about his appearance that much? His demeanor is quite unlike Lex, as he uses more of his mouth than his brain. I really can't tell that he is a genius billionaire mastermind. He is more like a plump guy trying to manipulate those weaker and dumber than him. Also, in the films, Superman didn't do anything to him so there was no motivation for him in wanting to eliminate Superman. Another problem was regarding the powers. I'm pretty sure General Zod and his gang aren't supposed to have the ability to fire beams that can make stuff levitate. And whats Superman throwing his blanket on the enemy and it disappearing? Also, like Superman, General Zod is supposed to have super-hearing so he probably shouldn't have fell for that trap. But oh well!Apart from these problems, it is a pretty good movie. In terms of action and pace, I prefer this film over its predecessor.

201,twm-2,"Campy, idiotic, though often entertaining--hardly worthy of the lavish reviews found on ""metacritic""",6,19 April 2010,"On ""metacritic""--a service that compiles movie ratings from established critics and averages those ratings--the film, ""Superman II"" has the second highest rating of any film rated since metacritic was born (behind ""The Godfather""). That rating of ""99"" (out of a hundred) has got to be the most ridiculously inappropriate rating in the history of rating film. ""Superman II"" has a few nice moments--but the villains are too, well, comic-bookish (compare to Heath Ledger's The Joker), and the script has some incredible gaffs--for example, when the trio of super-villains land on the moon, they walk up to astronauts there AND SPEAK TO THEM (!!!!--no matter how super-powerful you may be, you're just not going to be able to use your vocal chords in a vacuum)--and then there was the inexplicable emergence of certain powers in Superman--powers never explicated upon, powers that never existed in ol' Supe before. The first film, in spite of a slow start, was magnificent, thrilling entertainment, blending action and humor nearly perfectly and topped by the still unrivaled portrayal of a super-hero by Christopher Reeve (playing the role straight but with an ever-present twinkle in his eye). Reeve was just as good in this sequel, but all in all, the film was a mixture of the entertaining, and the incredibly stupid. How does that admixture rate a 99?",Superman II

203,ar87,My Second Favorite Movie Ever,10,16 August 2001,"CONTAINS SPOILERS Superman II was an excellent movie, with almost as much magic as the first one. This sequel focused more on romance than Superman I. The action scenes involved hand to hand combat, unlike Superman I. Christopher Reeve returned as the Man of Steel. Marlon Brando, due to legal problems, didn't appear in Superman II nor any of the other sequels. Gene Hackman returned as Lex Luthor, just as evil and manipulative as before. The plot is pretty simple. 3 villains who were banished to the Phantom Zone in the first movie were freed, when Superman hurled a hydrogen bomb into space. The villains made their way to Earth, and slowly discovered their growing powers. Meanwhile, Clark and Lois were assigned to pose as a newly-wed couple, to find out if a Niagra Falls hotel cheated it's customers. Lois started to piece Clark and Superman together, and eventually discovered his identity. The 3 villains, after hearing an astronaut calling for Houston, assumed that Earth was called Houston. The traveled to a small town called Houston (not in Texas), which they eventually burned down to ashes. They made themselves known, and declared that if the rulers of the world didn't give all authority of the world to General Zod, they would destroy cities, and kill people, until they changed their minds. Later, Superman brings Lois to the Fortress of Solitude. He tells her about his story, and how he discovered who he was, and what he had to do. He later gives up his powers for Lois, so that he can marry her. General Zod, Ursa, and Non take over the White House. They force the President to kneel towards them. The powerless Clark and Lois later go to a nearby diner. Clark is beaten up by a bully named Rocky. As Lois wipes the blood off of his face, the TV is turned on. They discover that the President, and all of the world leaders, have given all authority over Earth to General Zod. Clark decides he has to go back, and find someway to get his powers back. He walks miles and miles to the fortress and solitude. He has no way of communicating to his father, and all of the crystals have been destroyed, so it seems hopeless. Suddenly, there is a green glow on the ground. He finds the green crystal that called to him when he was a teenager. Later, Lex Luthor leads Zod, Ursa, and Non to the Daily Planet. They hold Lois hostage, and hope that eventually Superman will come to save her. Amazingly, Superman comes, and invites General Zod outside. There is a huge fight outside, leaving debris everywhere. Superman is crushed in between a bus and a Marlboro truck. He manages to get out, and looks at all of the damage General Zod, Ursa, and Non have made. He realizes that this fight isn't safe for the civilians, and it's destroying the entire city, so he flees. Luthor takes the Super villains to the fortress of solitude. They bring Lois as well, to give him another disadvantage. They find him in the Fortress. The villains, and Superman, are using holograms of some sort to disappear, and reappear in different places. Superman grabs General Zod, but Ursa and Non threaten to tear Lois apart if he harms the General. Luthor tells General Zod about the molecule chamber, and how it can take Superman's powers away from him. Superman is forced to enter it, because of Lois. He comes out, and kneels to Zod. Zod asks him to take his hand, he does, and then amazingly, he crushes it. He picks Zod up over his head, and throws him into the wall. Zod falls into a crevice in the ground. Non tries unsuccessfully to fly at Superman, and he falls as well. Lois punches Ursa into a ditch, thereby trapping all of the villains. Luthor realizes that Superman switched the molecule chamber, so everyone outside of it felt its effects. Superman and Lois leave Luthor in the fortress, while they fly away. The next morning, Superman finds Lois, distraught. He gives her a ""kiss of amnesia,"" which takes Lois' memory of everything that happened with Superman away. The movie ends with Clark coming back to the diner. Rocky attempts to punch him, but breaks his fist in the process. Clark spins him around in a chair, stops it, picks him up and sits him down on his plate, and then throws him into a pinball machine. Clark gives the owner of the diner money for the damage, and then leaves. Superman flies to the White House, with the American flag in his hand, and returns it. The movie ends with the famous shot of Superman flying above Earth, and smiling at the camera.Superman II had a long and hard history behind it. Parts of it were filmed by Richard Donner, while other parts were filmed by Richard Lester, who would go on and direct Superman III. Donner was fired, and he received no credit whatsoever of his work. Very few of Lester's shots had any merit, most of them were filled with camp (attempted and unoriginal humor.) You do have to give him credit however, for parts like the last Daily Planet scene. I guess people are a little biased towards all of his work, because of the camp of Superman III.Parts of Superman II were filmed during the filming of Superman I. Superman I featured a script with a huge number of scenes - it was basically cut in half into Superman I and Superman II. Released in 1980, 2 years after Superman I, Superman II is an amazing movie, and a worthy successor of Superman: The Movie",Superman II

207,jo007r,"Just as good, if not better than the original",10,16 August 2000,"This movie picks up right where the first one left off.  Most of the special effects in this movie will seems dated again, but they are better than the ones from the original.  Christopher Reeve once again shows off his acting ability as he does an even better job of his portrayal as the Man of Steel and the Mild Mannered Clark Kent.  He not only looks bigger in this movie, but he also dominates every scene he is in with incredible poise.  The three villains he is pitted against, are all unique in their own way and they hold their own.  The best out of these three villains is Terence Stamp, General Zod, the leader of three rogue Kryptonians.  He and Reeve are the ones who really treat the movie goers to this film.  Gene Hackman is also back, but his role is even less demanding this time around.  Yet he still provides loads of entertainment with each of his scenes.  The screenplay involves Superman falling for Lois Lane and abandoning his powers while the three rogues from Krypton tear the Earth apart.  The only thing that is confusing about this sub-plot is the fact that Lois Lane is in love with Superman, yet he gives up everything which makes him that!  That is the one hole I can find whenever I watch this movie, other than that it is incredible.  Finally the showdown between Superman and the three rogues in Metropolis is the best scene of the entire movie and probably the best scene out of the whole series.  Up to this point in the movie there has been incredible hype about the final showdown between these four people, and it exceeds everyone's expectation.  This fight just about destroys most of Metropolis. 
The final scene between Clark and Lois is extremely poignant and very touching to see how these two characters say 'I love you' in their own unique way.  The love story is not excellent in this comic book film, but it also stands up to other ROMANTIC films as well.  By the end of the film, as we see Superman fly off and smile at us before he disappears, we are given this heart warm feeling that somewhere up above us, he is actually looking out for us all.",Superman II

210,col_rutherford,A Super Sequel,7,14 June 2003,"Before the ""Superman"" franchise went completely to hell with the third and fourth installments and the spin-off ""Supergirl"", there was this fitting follow-up. ""Superman II"" picks up where the original movie left off and brings back most of the original cast (the notable exception is Marlon Brando, whose scenes as Jor-El were cut by the producers to avoid paying him royalties). Since ""Superman II"" doesn't have to go through all the exposition that the first film had to it is shorter, faster paced, and has more action.Superman (Christopher Reeve) renounces his powers for the love of Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) after she discovers his secret identity. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) escapes from prison and joins forces with three Kryptonian criminals (Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran) accidentally freed from the Phantom Zone by the Man of Steel. Superman must somehow regain his abilities when the evil Kryptonians conquer America.""Superman II"" boasts some wonderfully over the top action sequences. It's like a comic book come to life. Because he's so powerful, Superman needs big challenges in order to be an interesting character. It's a stroke of genius to pit Superman against three bad guys who all have his powers, forcing Supes to rely on his brains and courage instead of brawn. The villains are great, particularly Stamp's power hungry General Zod.But what also makes this film work is the surprisingly touching and bittersweet love story. Superman is torn between his love for one woman and his duty to protect the entire world. His final decision is heartbreaking but understandable. ""Superman II"" does have some flaws , including numerous plot holes, shameless product placements, and the injection of some silly comedic bits that foreshadow the campy disaster that was ""Superman III"".

I recommend that this movie should be watched by nine years old and up. This had good acting and more better ideas than the first.

It is one of the few movies that can live up to, if not surpass the original. The only problem is, the first Superman wasn't that good. And neither, sadly, is this. It's good for a laugh, but as a movie fan, it's pretty lame.There are too many questions looming over this for it to be realistic. Firstly, why is Lois Lane in Paris when those terrorist blokes are going to blow up the Eiffel Tower? Is it just a coincidence that she was there, or did she fly across for it? In which case, how bloody long were those terrorists hanging around for? Then there's the stupidity of Superman to lose all his powers, so he can be with Lois. What's the point of this? does he not maybe think that she only likes him because he can do all that cool stuff? Poor Calel, he ditches the superpowers, so essentially being his alter ego, Clark Kent, who everybody laughs at cos he's a massive loser.Regardless of being human, he is still a big guy, so why does he get his ass so roundly whipped by some chump in a lumberjack shirt? And why do the diner owners not call the cops when he's destroying their establishment by chucking a man about? Calel soon realises that he looks, and is, a pecker now he doesn't have his super powers, and sees a news report about General Zod tearing up the place so he tries to get his powers back. How did he not hear him wrecking the joint when he still had his powers? He's so selfish. He has the ability to help the whole world, but just spends his time cavorting with that ropey wench.However, the redeeming feature of this film, is that it brings us the superb General Zod. Obsessed with making people kneel in front of him, General Zod and his two croneys fly about the place wreaking havoc. They have an on off relationship with Lex Luthor who foolishly tries to make a deal with them so he can rule Australia.Superman 2 is a bit poor to watch, but the 2 weiners who hang about with Zod are weird, and the bird has some really crappy lines. Zod himself has numerous rubbish lines, but delivered with such gusto as to make them excellent.Watch with a pinch of salt, and a few beers, and this will be brilliant. Watch it sober and taking it seriously, you'll want to burn the DVD.",Superman II
214,anna-42,Planet Houston... what a strange surface,10,1 June 1999,"I am probably the only person in the world who thinks this , but I honestly believe that Superman II is (and I'm not joking), one of the absolute greatest, most fun movies of all time.  I think I've seen it 300 times (no exaggeration), and at least thirty of those were during the original theatrical release.  Once, my father and I sat through it twice.  This movie has it all-- humor, melodrama, three supervillains.  What is there not to like about it?  And unlike most sequels, it actually improves on the original.  I feel about this movie (and the original Superman) the way many movie goers feel about Star Wars.  There's something so mythical, so archetypal about it.  The scene where Superman faces off against General Zod and his flunkies is sheer magic.  Maybe I just love this movie because of my childhood memories, but I loved a lot of stuff during my childhood (fruit roll ups, Shira Princess of Power, football players, etc.) that I can't stand now, and therefore the conclusion I'm coming to is that regardless of nostalgia, this film rules.   Go out and rent this movie, and the original, but don't bother getting Superman III or IV, because they are an embarrassment compared to the first two.",Superman II
215,MrLuthor89,One of the best Sequels...can't wait for the Donner Version...,10,24 February 2006,"While I'm still excited and anticipating both ""Superman Returns"" and the Richard Donner cut of ""Superman II"", I can only go back and appreciate the two great Superman Epics that changed the way action/science fiction movies are made today (yes, I say the two Superman movies because, in my eyes, III and IV did NOT happengod bless Bryan Singer!). This film, while somewhat contradictory to part one in a small manner, and a bit choppy with it's editing and humor, IS an exciting and riveting piece of comic book action adventure, and one to be watched and enjoyed time and time again. While I'm still upset that Donner's cut never saw the light of day, Richard Lester did his best no to destroy this blockbuster sequelhe did THAT in ""Superman III"". The film reunites Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder in one of the most famous romances in pop culture. It combines the classic romantic elements with a great and powerful storyline, packed with great villains, catastrophic events, and bellicose battle sequences in to one of the best movie sequels of all time.The film picks up only a short time after Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El (Christopher Reeve) brought the villainous real-estate tycoon/master criminal, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) to justice after his cataclysmic plan to destroy California. After Clark is notified by his aggressive and fast-talking boss, Perry White (Jackie Cooper), about Lois Lane's (Margot Kidder) venture to Paris, France to cover a hydrogen bomb threatSuperman rushes to the rescue. Within minutes he rescues Lois, topples the terrorists, and hurls the vicious bomb into outer space. Little does Superman knowthe bomb's explosive impact destroyed the chamber in which his father's arch nemesis, General Zod (Terence Stamp) was imprisoned in. Zod, along with his female accomplice, Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and the mindless Non (Jack O'Halloran), head for Earthas Zod puts ""Finally to Rule!"" Meanwhile, Lex Luthor, the self proclaimed ""Greatest criminal mind of all time"" has managed to break free of his maximum security prison with one thing on his mindRevenge on Superman. Following their story involving a corrupt ring of Honeymoon HotelsLois Lane finally discovers Clark's identitySuperman. This only leads for the two to confess their love for one anotherand flee to Superman's home, The Fortress of Solitude. While Lois and Kal-El focus on their flourishing love affair, General Zod and his followers begin tearing the United States apartfrom destroying a middle-America town, to defacing Mount Rushmore, and finally taking hold of the White House. After forcing his hand, Zod managed to make the President of the United States (E.G. Marshall) bow to him as absolute ruler.Now that Kal-El is cut off from the worldhe decides to relieve himself of his duties as our hero, to become human, all for Lois. Although his mother, Lara (Susannah York), warns him of his inability to return, Kal-El chooses to use the Fortress's crystal chamber to become human. Now, as Clark, he and Lois try to begin a normal life with one another. It is only after he is pummeled by a bully at a diner, that Clark discovers his father's enemy has now taken over the globe. Now he must return to the Fortress, now in ruins, to beg his father's guidance. Once his powers return, he sets a course to Metropolis, where he makes an awful discovery, that the Daily Planet and Lois Lane are being held by General Zod and his new partnerLex Luthor. Now Superman must take on his deadly enemies from street to stars, from buildings to ice, all for Truth, Justice, the American way, Lois and his father. Returning Christopher Reeve once again does a brilliant job with the role that will forever hold his presence, Superman. He gives such power and heroism to the character, and is able to match that with grace and humanityshowing it isn't easy nor luxurious to be the Man of Steel. Margot Kidder does an amazing job as Lois, I thought she did an even better job this time around. You really believe that she is heart broken because of her tragic love for Superman, and, in the end, you can't help but feel her pain. Terence Stamp creates one of the most memorable, cunning, and ferocious villains that film history has ever seen. His deep and powerful voice and memorable dialog make his General Zod unbeatable. Gene Hackman returns to the ego-maniacal, venomous, and often hysterical version of master villain Lex Luthor. While some may argue his Lex as a joke, I can't help but love his snaky performancea dark villain is goodbut a villain you can laugh with is far more enjoyable.Filled with incredible visual effects for it's time, a powerful musical score (recycled from John Williams), and brilliant performances all aroundthis is one Action-filled comic book film that you do not want to miss.",Superman II
216,tinie_au,Magic!,10,7 September 2021,"I remember watching this for the 1st time as a child in the evening at the Village Cinemas on George Street, Sydney with my family, & at the end everyone was clapping & the whole experience was so exciting and magical. More than 30 years have passed & I still watch this movie on DVD with the same feelings undiminished. It's such an excellently edited film, the action, the humour, and enhanced with one of the best musical scores.Superman 2 for me was actually even more enjoyable than the 1st (which I loved as well) maybe because of the 3 villains & superman having to battle against them like David vs Goliath. I even love all the product placements they had in the city night battle! Sadly I don't think there will ever be a Superman movie that tops this one.",Superman II
217,Jim-480,Garbage,3,4 December 2005,"The difference between this film and Superman: The Movie is astonishing. This film goes wrong on so many levels it's amazing that anybody associated with it is still working.Superman 2 finds a far more introspective Superman. He questions whether he really wants the burden of being Superman, or whether he wants a domestic life where he can fall in love, have a family, and live for himself and his immediate significant other. This isn't a new theme (most of Superman is a Christ allegory anyhow), but has the potential to be tackled well here. Problem is, it isn't.*SPOILERS* Superman is forced to choose between whether or not he wants his powers. He is told this by the spirit of his dead mother, who informs him that once he makes the choice, he cannot go back. He makes the choice, decides he doesn't like it, and goes back to being a superhero. It's stupid, and ruins the emotional resonance of his choice. *END SPOILERS*The film had two directors, and the aforementioned thematic problem is not the only symptom of that change. The story appears to have been constructed by someone that knew what they were doing, but that then made the mistake of handing it off to a brain-damaged monkey to write the script.The dialog is atrocious. In fact, you could mold a college class on how NOT to write dialog based on this film alone. When Superman saves a woman and her baby from a falling steeple (don't ask), the woman calmly turns to Superman, waves and says ""thaaank youuuu."" The villains have an annoying tendency to explain everything that is going on on screen, sort of like sports announcers. The primary motivation for General Zod is to get the earth to submit to him. We know this because he yells ""KNEEL BEFORE ME!"" approximately three dozen times throughout the movie. Though it would make for a great drinking game, it does not qualify as great writing.The movie might be interesting otherwise if it weren't for the lousy acting, choppy pacing, stupid plotting, and cheap special effects. Now, you might be saying ""How can you make fun of special effects from 1980 - 25 years ago,"" to which I reply ""watch the movie."" Non (the dumb villain) has the ability to shoot beams from his eyes. Okay, Superman has that, too. But Non's laser beams are better because they originate from the same place on the screen while Non bobs his head.The film can be looked at as campy. It is clearly horrible, but there is not a hint of irony from anyone on the screen. They all play it straight. And in fact, it is so bad, that it almost overshadows the great performances by Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeve. Hackman, in a nearly throw-away performance by Lex Luthor, is so good in every frame that it's a shame that they weren't able to make the movie about him. Reeve plays the character of Superman quite well, though he's not the scene stealer that Hackman is. Margot Kidder is basically reduced to watching Superman, but she does good work with what she's given.It's a shame that it had to be camp. It's fun for what it is, but because of what it could have been it's tragic to watch. If you're a fan of Superman and haven't seen any of the films, watch the first one and skip 2 - 4. They're not worth your time.",Superman II
218,makoz,"Superman II, the worst movie ever made",1,17 July 2006,"When I was a kid, I remember Superman II to be the most exciting film ever made. I loved it when he loses his powers and gets them back. Now, I'm 36. Got a kid (4 years old) who loves to watch it. So, now I've seen this Drek 150 times in a month. I cannot believe how bad this movie is on so many levels.Special Effects: Horrible. You can see green screen halos in every flight sequence.Villains - Silly and stupid.Set -- clearly a sound stage. Superman I at least had the feeling it was filmed in a live city. SII looks like it was filmed in my basement.Overall Plot - Stupid. Superman would never give up his powers for Lois Lane. Ain't gonna happen. She's a $20 hooker in this movie, a smoker, looks and dresses horribly. What would Superman possibly see in ""this"" Lois Lane. She should be the sweet lovable girl next door.. one that we could all fall in love with. Margot Kidder is a joke.The only thing worse than superman II is superman III and superman IV. I feel terrible for Christopher Reeve, but he aided and abetted the destruction of a great franchise.",Superman II
219,katstar1982,Superwhipped,8,26 November 2007,"As far as sequels go, Superman II is very good. Some people say it is even better than the original. I don't know if I would go so far as to say that, but it is definitely slaphappier. It features the three Kryptonian villains who had been convicted of evildoing in the beginning of the first installment and imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, which is interpreted in this translation as a mirror-like trapezoid that indefinitely hurls itself through space. Apparently though, there were some design flaws. For one thing, prisoners do not age while doing time in the Phantom Zone. And the engineers obviously did not anticipate that after floating around for thirty-five years or so the portal would pass by the Earth. And they further did not anticipate that Superman would hurl an elevator rigged with a hydrogen bomb into space at precisely the right moment, shattering the portal. The ensuing storyline reflects a perfect combination of Reagan era and Freudian sensibilities. It's all about the deleterious effects of domineering women on traditional masculinity. For instance, the evil Ursa has no respect for established, successful, virile men. She destroys soldiers, cops, and astronauts and then rips off their badges and medals (a metaphor for penis envyshe steals their status symbols which stand in for their respective manhoods). Also, Lois and Superman hook up. But it renders him completely useless because he is forced to forfeit all his powers in order to put up with her unyielding gender-rebellion. Lois is a successful professional with no intention of settling into feminine domesticity. And she's not the softest looking woman ever to grace the silver screen either. Superman can't embody the traditional male role without a traditional wife. So by being in love with her, he is emasculated. Literally. I especially enjoy the scene when he gets beat up by a redneck in a roadside diner and Lois joins the brawl in a humiliating attempt to rescue him. And in addition to its gender politics, it is hilarious when remembering all that grief his Kryptonian mother expressed in the original Superman about sending her son off to a strange world where he would always feel like an alien outsider. If they could rob him of his socially ostracizing super powers, why didn't they do it to begin with? Why take them away from him in adulthood after his identity is fully formed and he is fully dependent on them? Silly Kryptonians. Anyway, the movie is quite a lot of fun. It straddles a fine line between being a graceful interpretation of an unprecedented comic icon like the first Superman film, and being a Theater of the Absurd-like interpretation as captured by Superman III. Not to be confused with the Theater of the Inane interpretation, which is so masterfully executed in Superman IV.",Superman II
220,Victory_Over_Trolls,"Great cast, but mediocre direction.",6,13 March 2005,"I really, REALLY, wanted to like this movie. It's about my favorite character, it's got three really good villains, it could have been really ahead of its time. Sadly, it's more of it's time, and unlike its predecessor, it doesn't have the same scope or depth.SPOILER WARNING!!! It's hard to explain how using the crystals in the Fortress of Solitude, he can ""talk to"" his departed Kryptonian parents, but basically his mother, Lara, takes away his powers as a result of his wanting to be with Lois. When he steps into the chamber, it's a grotesque montage of different (unnecessary) effects. Later, when he goes to get his powers back, there's no explanation or condition as to what makes them change their minds (or, come to think of it, why he should let them take his powers away in the first place).It's bad enough that the opening scene is paced so slowly that we're just thankful that he gets there the same day (he should be able to get from the States to the Eiffel Tower quicker than that), when the film slows down to the more intimate scenes, it feels slow. Not as slow as the first Batman movie, but still: slow. Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve are great, but the Niagra Falls setting does little to add interest. When it moves to the Fortress, it's a little better, but then it takes us to the scene where he gives up his powers, which leads to an unnecessary scene showing them in bed. It doesn't show any nudity and isn't raunchy or anything, but nothing happens and it might make kids uncomfortable.The villains in this movie are pretty cool. Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor, but quickly jettisons his bumbling team of goof balls. The three kryptonian bad guys give powerful performances. Terence Stamp and Sarah Douglass are authoritative while sadistic, and Jack O'Halloran is threatening as NON, ""the big one."" Lacking dialog (per his request) he does a great job of conveying his emotions with facial expressions. Anyway, SPOILER WARNING, when they take over Washington, it's a good scene. It's how all of the scenes show have been. Sarah Douglass tosses people around like paper. I think it's safe to say that that was probably a Donner scene.As for the special effects, there's a scene where the three bad guys take over a town in Texas. It's okay, but there's a scene in which Zod deflects a flame thrower with his super breath. It's glaringly fake. There are other less-than-convincing F/X elsewhere (but there are also some good ones). Plus, as is common in some Superman vehicles, the powers are inconsistent. Zod appears to have telekinesis: a power Superman never demonstrated. The Fortress scene shows them teleporting, as well. And then there's what Superman does to make Lois ""forget"" that he's really Clark Kent. Finally, the climax in Time Square is far too choreographed. Moreover, the civilians in the city don't seem particularly scared of what's going on. They almost look like Superman and his enemies are putting on a show for them. ""This is gonna be good,"" says one guy. ""Man, Superman didn't do nothing',"" says a kid.When the first Superman film was released on DVD, I thought, ""here we go."" It was given the treatment it deserved. I thought this might be re-cut and have documentaries and stuff like the first one. No such luck. As if it were one of the first DVDs ever released, all it has is chapter selection, optional subtitles, a cast & crew thing, and a (pretty cool) trailer. It's not without its audience, but unlike the first one, it lacks that universal appeal.",Superman II

Meanwhile Superman is falling in love with Lois Lane. all in all a good sequel but not quite topping the original but still worth watching. Overall 9/10 (by the way i think Sarah Douglas as Ursa is very fit..

223,RobTheConqueror,Surpasses the Original,9,15 January 2016,"While 1978's Superman launched the superhero movies genre and proved that good movies could be made out of (to be blunt) childish comic book characters, it was it's sequel that set the standard for just how great superhero movies could be. Sam Raimi's wonderful first two Spider-Man films (in particular his second one, a masterpiece) can both be traced back to this, as it focuses on the man behind the blue costume. The film focuses on Superman ultimately being forced to reveal his secret identity to love interest Lois Lane after a series of clues causes her to catch on. As they fall deeper in love, he ultimately decides he wants to be with her, and gives up all of his powers to do, although after an ugly encounter with a man named Rocky at a cafe that makes him uncomfortable with how vulnerable he now is, and the arrival of escaped Kryptonion criminal, the ruthless General Zod, who conquers Earth with the help of his equally dangerous associates Ursa and Non, he is forced reconsider. The plot ultimately resolves itself after Zod's defeat, with Lois becoming depressed at the thought of never being able to be with him or or move on from him, so Clark does the noble thing of wiping her memory of his true identity to spare her the pain. This aspect is very well written and one of the few romance story lines in the superhero genre they've managed to get right.Acting wise, I can't even express how good Reeve is as Clark/Superman. He absolutely nails Clark's awkward facade to a tee, and strikes the perfect line between corny and badass as Superman. I'm still not sure how he manages to pull off this character so well. It's uncanny. Kidder also impresses as Lois, being given a much wider range of scenes and emotions in this, and thus more to do. Gene Hackman also returns as chief antagonist Lex Luthor in a supporting role, and even he is much better in this than the previous one, finally free of his annoying associates and awful dialogue that dragged his character down in the first movie. It's Terrance Stamp who owns the entire thing though, with his scene stealing performance as the diabolical General Zod, completely nailing every line, facial expression and movement for his character. He's so good that he managed to turn a forgettable character from the comics into a cultural icon.This movie had a troubled production, with director Richard Donner being replaced after completing half of the movie due to conflicts with the producers, with credited director Richard Lester finishing the product. Donner's full vision for the film would be released as ""The Richard Donner cut"" in 2006, and is also brilliant, but the theatrical version remains just as good and just as well made despite the behind-the-scenes nightmare. In fact, Lester's more comedic version seems to work well here, blending in with the drama seamlessly (with the exception of the terrible slapstick used during the Metropolis battle scene) to to create a highly enjoyable film filled with romance, humour, action and drama and ultimately the best Superman movie of then all. Just a shame Lester then ruined it all with the...Uh....next installment.",Superman II

I was 13 when 1978's ""Superman: The Movie"" was released and I loved it passionately. As much as I loved the original movie, I loved ""Superman II"" even more. I still remember that hot June day in 1981 when I saw a double feature of two brand new movies, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Superman II."" That was the best movie day of my young life.""Superman II"" picks up exactly where part one left off. It kicks into maximum overdrive in the opening scenes and never lets up. The film is full of awesome action, great humor, great villains and a sense of fun that so many modern superhero movies are missing. I absolutely love ""The Dark Knight"", ""Marvel's The Avengers"", ""Iron Man"", the X-Men movies, etc., but they lack the fun factor and the heart of ""Superman II.""Christopher Reeve WAS Superman. He proved that after his tragic accident. He kept fighting to the end and never gave up the battle. I truly admired that man. On screen, no one will ever top him. Cavill is very good, Routh was okay, but Reeve WAS Superman.Gene Hackman was terrific as Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder was absolutely believable as Lois Lane. Terence Stamp was amazing as the evil Zod. This movie (along with ""Superman: The Movie"", ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"", and ""Alien"") was a constant on my parents' VCR in the early '80s. I'm sure I drove them bonkers by playing it over and over again. I have since seen the Richard Donner cut and I loved that alternate version as well.

Superman II is a splendid mix of romance, action, suspense and comedy. It was made in a time when they actually used practical effects and models because they didn't have the computerised technology they have these days. I was impressed with the wire work and the action sequences were an awesome spectacle to behold. Actors like Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman make their triumphant return to the series as does Ned Beaty, Terrance Stamp, Margot Kidder and the lovely Valerie Perrine. The score by Ken Thorne is never given the credit it deserves, neither does Richard Lester's fun, slapstick-filled direction. He simply did the job he was brought in to do. He's no Richard Donner, but the franchise was never bad with Lester at the helm. All in all, Superman II is a wonderful motion picture and a great companion piece to the original.",Superman II

228,dunamission,Zod kicks ass in this super sequel,7,5 December 2008,"I love the original superman movie, and this carries on where the last one left off. I've got the Donner cut as well but the original is the best. If they put brando's scenes in the theatrical Lester version, then that would be the ultimate version for me. The three villains steal the show in this movie to be honest, particularly the pretentious power hungry Zod. They fly around having a great time wrecking everything while superman is trying to get Lois into his love shack of solitude. The scenes between Lois and superman/Clark are a bit slow and boring. The entire film is building up to the climactic battle in metropolis between superman and the three krypton lunatics who are hell bent on making him kneel. The dialogue is atrocious, but for some reason it all works because the movie isn't trying to be serious. Zod is so happy to see superman at last, he proudly says, ""Son of Jor el, we were beginning to think you were a coward"", ""I'm not a coward, Zod"", ""then die as you deserve to"". Ha ha! Great harmless fun that's far superior to the dreadful ""superman returns"".",Superman II
229,SecularTheocrat,A good sequel to a great movie,7,27 August 2018,"In my opinion this movie is still not quite as good as the first movie, it still manages to keep the flavour and charm of the original. For me what really stood out about this movie was the villains, which are Zod and his gang and Lex Luthor. Terrance Stamp stole the show as General Zod and really sold me on the character's arrogance in relation to Earth. This arrogance was best depicted during the whitehouse scene when upon learning that superman would challenge him, he merely retorts ""Who is this imbecile?"". What I liked about the Kryptonians in this movie was that all 3 of them were their own character with differing personalities, something which I felt was lacking in Man of Steel (No disrespect to Michael Shannon). Gene Hackman once again is brilliant as Lex Luthor, although for me he was overshadowed by Zod (Which is OK as Zod is the main villain of the movie).Ken Thorne's score is great and manages to hold up next to the John Williams score of the original.The special effects, while appearing dated by todays standards are very good for the time and still look very believable. These effects stood out during Superman's fight with Zodd in Metropolis and with the depiction of the Phantom Zone at the beginning of the movie.Unfortunately this is the last of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies that was of high quality. If you're planning on watching these movies I would recommend that you watch all 4 at least once, but for every subsequent viewing just watch the first 2.Also RIP Mr Snake, all he wanted to do was say hi",Superman II
230,hereminton,A truly great sequel and movie!,10,30 June 2006,"With Superman Returns opening now, I wanted to give my thoughts on this masterpiece. We were going to see it in a theater 25 years ago this month (July, 1981), but went to see The Cannonball Run instead, but I then rented it out and watched it a number of times on our VCR in 1983 and 1984, and then taped it off ABC in mid 1984 (and in fact thought the edited for TV version was even better than the VHS one). I watched the taped version of it a lot after that, and it became one of my ten favorite movies, and is now #10 for me. The relationship between Superman and Lois Lane is very good, but the heart of it is the three villains escaping and reaching Earth, then taking it over, Superman losing and regaining his powers, and the battle they have in Metropolis, and finally at the Fortress of Solitude. And the role Lex Luther plays in it is very interesting and a perfect fit, as their ""agent"". I thought the screenplay was the best of any movie I'd ever seen, and the direction was flawless (in spite of the fact that two directors really did it-I didn't even know that until reading it on here, but you sure can't tell). Its adventure and action are great and move right along, as does its drama, and they inter-cut perfectly.

After I did some research of the trilogy and movies Christopher Reeve has been in, I came across Somewhere in Time. This by FAR is my FAVORITE movie next to Superman II to date. If you compare the two films together, it really & truly shows the humble & gentle nature of Chris Reeve, as both a person & actor.

Aside from Star Wars and Indiana Jones, the only movie franchise to have a sequel truly worthy to its predecessors.Hindsight:  Looking back, yes, some of the plot points are silly.  But the acting is superb, and the main focal point of the plot is never lost.Superman is faced with the blood-thirsty criminals of Krypton placed in the Phantom Zone by his father.  Terrence Stamp performs flawlessly as as the manaiacal General Zod.  The movie deals with Superman giving up his strength and powers for love, then having to obtain them back again to fight the trio once they basically take over the Earth.The trio of baddies are proven time and again not to be as powerful as Superman, though they do take a few good shots at him in what still stands up today as one of the most titanic epic battles of good vs. evil on the bigscreen:  The fight in Metropolis.As a kid, I did not predict the end would come as it did.  I remember the movie theaters, for the first time in my life, being absolutely stoked and charged with energy during this movie.  Particularly notable cheering occured during the following moment:""General...would you care to step outside?""Classic.The epilogue scene was a delightful bonus, seeing Clark Kent going back after re-acquiring his powers and teaching Mr. Diner Man a lesson.
In spite of many attempted and dropped projects to make a new generation of Superman movies since the late 90s, this one and its predecessor (Superman: The Movie) will never be repeated, or duplicated in terms of raw performance and great directing.Superman II gets 9 stars out of 10.",Superman II

234,Julieburck-659-159866,Terrible in Every Way,1,26 September 2020,"It's Terrible. And I'm not just talking about the terrible special effects. I'll give that a pass-it was 40 years ago. But the casting. The audience should be rooting for the main characters. I didn't. Superman, chivalrous, All-American good guy, is wimpy, ridiculous and one-dimensional... undesirable in every way. And that's hard to do w Reeve who is gorgeous. Margot Kidder isn't believable as a love interest. Im supposed to believe Clark Kent would give up his powers for her???? Yeah, right. Never in a million years. She's loud and brash and treats him like dirt. What in the world would he Ever see in her???These are worst types of movies. With some thought and good direction it could have been very good-like an Indiana Jones flick. It feels just thrown together with no character development, a plot that doesn't make sense, just weirdness all around. At one point, when the bad guys land in ""podunk Idaho"" amongst rednecks, some little kid comes out screaming Something like ""hey leave my dad alone"" In a British accent. The redneck bit was so insulting - small towns in Middle America are always filled w stupid rubes {sarcasm}-but when that kid came out, I laughed out loud so hard I had to pause the movie. That's not a good thing. It was so absurd.I don't know what people are talking about. This is two hours I can never get back. Kids wanted to watch so I did it. But Absolutely nothing redeeming about it. Lost opportunity for sure .",Superman II

236,BigMarty,Great entertainment,8,15 October 1998,"Of all the Superman movies, I liked this one the best.  The first Superman was good, but the special effects were pretty poor and I thought some of the important scenes were overacted and melodramatic.  The third Superman was kind of corny, what with Richard Pryor being himself and that woman who turned into a machine or whatever it was.  The fourth Superman was a sad, sad joke probably intended to destroy the whole Superman fan base and marketing empire (I can't imagine why else it would be so horrible).As far as this installment goes, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  General Zod (the gifted Terence Stamp) and his cronies were excellent as the three exiled Kryptonian criminals who do battle with Superman.  I also liked the subplot in which Superman gives up his powers so he can love Lois like a mortal; I thought it was an interesting idea and seeing ex-Superman getting beat up by a sleazy trucker was certainly ironic.  Everyone did a good job all-around (especially Reeve and Stamp), the effects were adequate, and the plot flowed smoothly and made complete sense.  All-around a great piece of entertainment and one of the best of the superhero movies (not that there's much competition in that genre, though).",Superman II
237,Colby6921,"Superman II, A Great Film",7,23 July 2006,"Superman II is really one of the best Superhero Sequels of all time. It fits perfectly into place with the original, the opening scenes act as reminders from the first film, showing how the 3 villains were sent away just as Superman had been by his father, and also shows how Superman had gotten a reputation in the first film. The film gives its impact because Lois Lane discovers what is true about Clark Kent. And Clark becomes vulnerable against 3 who are just like him. Christopher Reeve did great in the movie, and Gene Hackman brought back his substantial role also. A good movie for Superman or Superhero movie fans. If you've seen Superman Returns, watch the first 2! It will be put all together, 2 really great movies!",Superman II

That one is my 3rd favorite.  I was so excited.  But, this one, this my 2nd favorite.  I watch this nonstop. I even like the fight between Zod, Ursa, and Non against Superman.  I even liked how he fools them by taking their powers away from them.  That is my best picture of (1980), best Warner Bros movie, best rated PG movie, and best movie poster of (1980).",Superman II
239,jmlane,Donner Cut Rules!,1,15 December 2006,"Want my advice? Any real Superman, or film fan for that matter, should bypass this mess and go straight to the Richard Donner Cut - the REAL version of Superman II. The Lester version is similar to taking a perfectly good, tasty meal and pouring salt all over it! Please, please, please, see Richard Donner's version - it FEELS like part 2 to Superman the movie. .Lester's version is camp, soul-less, energy-less and tiresome. Just leave it well alone! In every way possible, the Donner cut reigns over this version. I just can't believe that we were denied the Donner version for so long. At least now, with the Donner cut and Superman Returns, the franchise is well and truly back on track!",Superman II
240,comics@webtv.net,One of the Best Ever Comic Book Movies of All Time,10,22 January 2006,"still one of the best comic book movies ever made. only rivaled by the two spiderman movies so far.......as of jan..2006 i like this movie because they decided to have fun with the characters and made the movie like you were reading a comic book out of the silver age....the crowd actually cheered a few times at the movie theater which tells you something.... just watched it again tonite and liked it as much as the first time. so i rate this better than any of the other superman movies, any of the batman ,x-men, hulk daredevil or fantastic four...the next fantastic four might rival this , we will soon see.... the batman 2 movie was pretty good, but this is better.... looking forward to the new superman movie out later this year.....i sure hope supey fights braniac one day",Superman II
241,shelliryan,My Favorite '80's Big Budget Blockbuster!,10,5 June 2003,"SUPERMAN II is, IMO, one of the best films ever made, and one of the most underrated. I put it in the same category as the STAR WARS or INDIANA JONES films. It had all of the makings of those films - big budget, ""movie brat"" director, and based on what was traditionally considered a ""low"" genre, in this case, comic books. But SUPERMAN II takes those basic concepts and really runs with them, and as a child, I found it unforgettable.We have ALL asked, ""what if Lois Lane knew that he was really Superman?"" In SUPERMAN II, we find out. Whenever we see a superhero movie, we want to see a knock-down, drag out fight, and we get it in the scene when Superman fights all three villains in Metropolis, a scene that runs a good half hour. And it even continues the thematic elements of ""God in human form"" as introduced in the first film, when Superman needs his powers back and calls for his ""Father,"" practically asking, ""why hast thou foresaken me?"" I based every adventure fight / story / whatever I wrote for the rest of my life on the general patterns / pacing / scope of this film, and to an sci-fi / action fan, it's an absolute winner. One of my favorite movies of all time.",Superman II

243,danmar,excuse me while I flush,1,18 April 2003,"I don't understand why people like this movie. It's one of the worst big-budget films I've ever seen. Nothing about it is good. The effects, the editing, the wooden acting (except for Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder's not bad), the direction, none of it is good. I laughed out loud when I saw the film crew boat's wake when they were showing one of the villains flying after Superman over the river. And that's not the worst of it. It's not as good as the first and doesn't deserve to be anywhere near 6.4/10.",Superman II
244,btemple-3,Great Sequel,9,31 January 2007,"I think Superman II is definitely one of the best sequels. I do agree with another review that was done that the richard lester version was done more on a comedic level instead of the Richard donner version which is more like an action/adventure. In fact sometimes friends of mine and I watch the movie and laugh at some of the dialog and some of the scenes because they really are goofy, but in a good way. I love the 3 villains, but truthfully they should have been portrayed as rougher and someone we would all be scared of, at times you can only laugh, especially at Non. I think the beginning of the movie was great when rolling the credits to flashbacks of Superman I. You definitely can tell the difference between some of the scenes shot by Richard donner and the scenes shot by richard lester. I think the movie was great, but probably would have been better if Lester had just continued where Donner left off. Why someone wont release the Donner footage i will never understand. What good is it locked up.",Superman II
245,Steamhop4,"Not as good as the first, but still great!",7,8 August 2015,"I'm glad this movie is actually good, although I would have liked it if Richard Donner had stayed on for this. That's why Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is better than this. Positives: Christopher Reeve is Awesome, General Zod is a great villain, Terence Stamp nails it, and this movie has 3 PEOPLE TO FIGHT SUPERMAN. Negatives however: It's a teeny bit more campy, it's trying to be MORE like a comic book than the first one, and Richard Lester and the Salkinds Booted Donner off of the set. For the most part though, I like it. I'm gonna give Superman II a B. 7/10. 3.5/5, etc. If you loved the first movie like I did, you'll have less fun with this, but fun nonetheless. Go break a leg with Superman II.",Superman II
246,ChrisRetro98,"Still Good, but feels like they backtrack the overall story",7,24 January 2019,"Although I loved the first Superman film, I began to enjoy the second one until General Zod and others conquer earth. It almost feels like they backtrack on the story they have been building up for two movies by erasing Lois Lane's memory near the end of the film.I am about to watch the third one now, and I hope the story is built more upon.",Superman II
247,Robart471,A great sequel,8,6 March 2001,"As sequels go it's one of the best, but not as good as Superman: The Movie. It does have very good acting in it, and the special effects are as good as the first.This movie has it's faults though. First of all, the thought that Superman, with all his morals would think of himself first and give up his powers to marry Lois Lane is unthinkable and out of character. Secondly, speaking of character, the EXTRA powers that are given to Superman in this movie make it even harder to follow his character. Why didn't he use these powers in the first movie? I'll be happy to tell you why...Superman doesn't even have these powers at all. As with all super-hero movies, once the director or whomever goes outside the continuity of the character(s)it turns out to be the down fall of the movie itself.I did enjoy this movie a lot, but it still is a shadow of the first in the series. All in all, it was 3/4 Superman and 1/4 Hollywood.",Superman II
248,magnificguru,Best Superhero Movie Ever Hands Down,10,17 September 2006,"Oh how I love thee Superman let me count the ways! This film hands down is the big daddy superhero film of them all. It is the last great Superman film featuring the late great Chris Reeve and the battle in Metropolis in the third act between Superman and the three villains is the kind of movie magic we go to see movies for. You get your moneys worth in terms of fun, a good story, and special effects not overdone but blend well with the action of the story. The script has plenty of great liners especially coming from the three supervillains their leader, Zod, in particular. Terence Stamp truly shines as one bad ass superpowered bad guy. ""Kneel before Zod!""",Superman II
249,crack_the_skies,See the other version instead,2,1 December 2006,"This film is an amalgamation of two shoots of Superman II, and as a result has an inconsistent tone, poor pacing, inappropriate comedy, and comparatively poorer editing, music, and acting.This film feels half in earnest, and half as though it were done by someone who didn't like or believe in the material he had to work with. His lack of attention to detail (inconsistent makeup and wardrobe) and unconvincing alterations to the script make the whole thing rather silly in places.See the superior cut (Superman II: The Donner Cut), by original director Richard Donner instead. It's more dramatic, less 'campy,' and more consistent with the first film, as well as being remarkably complete.",Superman II
250,lewis1,Still a classic,9,19 May 2002,Even by todays standards I believe that this film still has much to offer. The good versus evil battle that puts the good guy fighting against all the odds is still a winning formula used by Hollywood execs even to this day. Let down only by two further mediocre sequels that have tarnished the very nature of the series you can still look back and say that you'll believe a man can fly. OK the film still has flaws ie the end battle at Superman's home. How did all the Super villains know how to make themselves into holograms with Superman. What the hell was the S thing that Superman throws at Non when Non does his flying charge. How did Lex get from the Arctic to jail. However more recent films consist of far more flaws even by todays standards e.g. Batman and Robin. I wouldn't even know where to begin with that pile of crap. Anyway by summing up I still love this film for giving me a superhero that I could worship and provide me with an icon that will be with me always,Superman II
251,mobwar20,Superman 2 Donner's Cut,8,1 July 2009,"As a child Superman 2 was always the fun film of the pair, of course back then one wasn't aware of the fact that films had crews let alone producers and directors. The biggest mistake the Salkind's ever made was dropping the crew of the first movie in order to rush a sequel patched together with both Donner's and Lester's material to save a few 'bucks'.Thanks to fan's desires and the restoration of the many tons of film reels eventually found in European vaults, Warner's finally allowed Donner to re cut Superman 2 as best as possible into his definitive or even 'intended' cut ! The result is something very special indeed. A direct continuation of the story as set up in Superman the movie with virtually no flaws. As a viewer you can even forgive the screen-test footage used for the Clark/Lois scene in which she produces the pistol to dupe Clark into admitting he is Supermen ! With the advantage of modern day post production editing and compositing, Donner and his restoration team were able to re-composite many of the original 'Lester' effects and in many cases used completely different 'takes' in order to maintain the narrative as it was intended. The return of Brando to the fortress of solitude is one such example of the beautiful work done by these classic film makers.Donner's restored cut of Superman 2 is by far a superior movie to the Salkind's theatrical release and pretty much eliminates the need for the second rate version to even exist.God Bless Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz",Superman II

Although, now at 18, I recently re-watched all the Superman movies, and find this to be good, but also bad.Superman 2 was a complete downfall compared to Superman: The Movie. Richard Lester really made me wonder, why cut some of the more pivotal points in the movie. It does have more action in it, compared to the first movie, but the story is so plain. Zod wants to rule the world. WOW! The story is just so basic.Although it does have its good points, I still found it less apelling then the original.

But it will be also extremely appreciated to have a new score composed by Maestro John Williams !!! One of the weak points of S2 was th re-use of the score as heard in Superman-the movie...AsRichard Donner is returning to this project, John Williams should be asked to re-score the film as well, I think that a new score will be a nice task to do, if the schedule of the Maestro John Williams permit to do so...

Also, Superman is thrown to a big Marlboro-plated cars. Even for an idiot is is obvious that Philip Morris has been financing this film which is actually true as I found out with very little Googling.As one of the main targets for this film is children one cannot but gasp at the brutal ways of marketing deadly products the tobacco industry uses.The film itself is of a mediocre level. There is nothing extraordinary in its story. As in many other films tuned for the biggest profits this one has the obligatory parts having been shot at the White House. Sigh! Having read dozens of Superman comic strips I really cannot tell how low I estimate this crap.",Superman II
