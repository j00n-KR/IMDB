0,TheLittleSongbird,"Far from perfect, but better than the first film",7,31 March 2011,"When it comes to the first Fantastic Four, I didn't hate it or anything but in more ways than one it could have been better as well. This sequel is an improvement in quite a few ways, but hampered by some of the flaws of the first film.The story had a great idea, had great potential and started off very well indeed. But in the middle I think it slackened in the pace and the story became less interesting and rather repetitive as a result. Also the film does have some cheesy and cringe-worthy dialogue especially in the one-liners, Reed and Doom unfortunately getting the worst of the lot.However, as I've said, there are several improvements. First and foremost, Silver Surfer. Silver Surfer alone is a more interesting character than any of the characters in the first movie, with a great design and performed just as impressively by the talented Laurence Fishburne. The special effects are incredible and greater in scope than the first, and the scenery is beautifully realised and perfectly captured by the crisp photography. Doom while having some bad lines is more intriguing here and developed and incorporated much better, and Julian McMahon's performance is deliciously evil and camp. Tim Story's direction is much more assured this time round too, John Ottman's score fits better here as well and the overall is shorter and better rounded off with a more exciting and less long-winded climax. The acting in general has also improved, while they are still the weak links in the cast Ioan Gruffodd and Jessica Alba's chemistry feels more natural and both feel more relaxed in their roles too. Michael Chiklis acquits himself even better, and Chris Evans provides the film's most amusing moments.All in all, imperfect but improved sequel. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
1,Leofwine_draca,"A simple kid's film, but still better than the first",3,14 July 2016,"I loathed the first FANTASTIC FOUR movie with a passion, so when I saw that this sequel was on TV I wasn't really considering watching it. In the event, nothing else was on, so I decided to give it a try. It was everything I expected, and nothing more.The best thing you can say about this film is that it's slightly better than the first. I find 'origin' stories long-winded and often boring, but that's not the case here. The film straight away gets on with the (slim) plot, so there's not a lot of time for boredom. However, there is a lot of silliness, mostly involving some excruciating CGI effects used to animate Ioan Gruffudd's stretchy arms and legs.Amid this kid's stuff, there's a very, very thin plot about the titular character, who flies around the world, causing disaster and making craters in the ground. After a couple of lacklustre set-pieces at the London Eye and Black Forest, there's an unsurprising twist, a briefly seen and rather ludicrous super-baddie (the size of a planet) and the unwelcome return of ultra-stiff actor Julian McMahon as the ludicrously named villain, Victor Von Doom.Gruffudd has the decency to look mildly embarrassed at all this, and Jessica Alba's acting is absolutely diabolical. Chris Evans is, once again, irritating, and only Michael Chiklis seems to be having fun as the guy made out of rock. The silver surfer is well animated (you can see that's where the money went), voiced by Laurence Fishburne and occasionally acted by the skinny guy in a suit Doug Jones (HELLBOY), but otherwise there's little of interest here for adults in what is definitely a kid's film.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
2,SnoopyStyle,Better than the first,7,28 September 2013,"Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Invisible Woman/Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Human Torch/Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and The Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) make up the Fantastic 4. This time they are much more like a bickering family. Reed and Sue are getting married, but superhero stuff keep getting in the way. They introduce the mysterious character of the Silver Surfer, and Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) is back causing problems.The best part of this movie is the family dynamics. They feel like a real family having family problems. They have much more chemistry this time around. The most fascinating must be the Silver Surfer. He's definitely the character with the most promise. But he's neither the good guy nor the bad guy. The moral ambiguity really muddies the waters. It's fascinating. The most disappointing must be Galactus. For a planet destroyer, the ending seems too tame. The final confrontation just wasn't special enough.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
3,claudio_carvalho,The Planet Devourer,8,22 June 2007,"While Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) are preparing to get married, a mysterious freezing phenomenon happens in a bay in Japan and in Egypt. The arrogant General Hager (Andre Braugher) meets Dr. Richards and he prepares a sensor to locate the source, and along his wedding, they disclose that the responsible is the alien Silver Surfer (Doug Jones). The despicable Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) joins Dr. Richards, Susan, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) providing information about the Silver Surfer, and Dr. Richards develops a device to separate the Surfer from his board and source of power. Susan makes contact with the Silver Surfer and he reveals that his leader, the planet devourer Galactus, is following the beacon in his board and will destroy Earth. When Victor discloses his real evil intention, the Fantastic Four joins to the Silver Surfer to save Earth from the destruction.I am a big fan of this type of fantastic adventure and I totally disagree with the unfair reviews about this entertaining movie. The story is funny, full of action, the special effects are great, Victor Von Doom is a great villain and The Silver Surfer does not deserve his fate in the end. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
4,classicsoncall,"""I like the part where he knocks you on your a_ _ .""",7,7 October 2007,"I get a kick out of looking over the viewer comments on this film who make it sound like Galactus was actually IN this movie. The way Hollywood works, I wouldn't be surprised if the next FF picture got around to identifying that dust vortex as something or somebody else altogether. You see, all the right code words were used, 'destroyer of planets', 'devourer of worlds', etc., but when you come right down to it, you can only assume that it was Galactus that the Silver Surfer was the herald of. OK, OK, you know it and I know it, but let's wait and see if Galactus actually makes an appearance down the road.Speaking of that vortex, it looked an awful lot like the same kind of device that showed up in the Star Trek episode 'The Doomsday Machine' some forty years ago. It's the one in which Commodore Matt Decker uses a shuttle from the Enterprise to blow up an entity that was just as powerful as said Galactus was presumed to be. So take away points for non-originality there. What that leaves you with is a fairly entertaining super hero flick if you go in for that kind of stuff, but nothing in the way of epic story telling on a grand scale. The CGI guys got it down excellent though with the appearance of the Silver Surfer, couldn't have been better as far as capturing this viewer's expectation.You know what else bothers me - couldn't they give Dr. Doom a voice that befits his evil status? I know, getting James Earl Jones would have invited Darth Vader comparisons, but come on, he already dressed like Vader and walked like Vader, but he wasn't that duck. But geez, anytime the character spoke as Doom, he sounded like a wuss.Hey, did you notice that traveling zit on Jessica Alba's forehead? When Sue Storm is shown talking to Alicia (Kerry Washington) early in the story, she has a blemish above her right eye, but just before she makes it disappear, it's above her left eye. One of the better super powers on display here.OK, that last comment invites a neg from the FF4 die-hards, but I'm working on not much sleep here. I enjoyed the movie for what it was, but agree with a lot of posters on this forum that it could have been a whole lot more. As for Stan Lee, I think this was my favorite cameo.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
5,gavin6942,"A Slight Dip From the First, But Still Good",6,9 May 2012,"The Fantastic Four learn that they are not the only super-powered beings in the universe when they square off against the powerful Silver Surfer and the planet-eating Galactus.So, I overcame my dislike of the Fantastic Four in the first film, and now I am almost ready to overcome my stronger dislike of Silver Surfer. I think he is a terrible character, but this film really focused on the tragedy of the character, echoing the tragedy of Ben Grimm in the first film. Seeing him as all-powerful but lonely? A nice touch.The film also tends to focus on the Surfer almost too much. Too little shown? Galactus. His portrayal is something of a disappointment (though I am compassionate with why he ended up how he did). And also, why did Doom come back? I am glad he did, but he plays such a small, marginal role. Nothing gets fleshed out as far as it should.This movie demands a sequel, but it will probably never get one now that Marvel is devoting every new film to the Avengers story.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
6,jboothmillard,4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,4,25 February 2010,"From director Tim Story (Barbershop), I saw that the review of this sequel being rated a little higher than the first film, which I did nearly enjoy, so I had to see the follow up. Basically after defeating Dr. Doom / Victor Von Doom (Premonition's Julian McMahon), the Fantastic Four are getting used to having their powers to save people, the Invisible Woman / Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) and Mr. Fantastic / Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) are planning to get married, and the Human Torch / Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and The Thing / Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) get on better. The only problem is, an evil creature from outer space called Galactus is planning Earth as its next target, and sends The Silver Surfer (Hellboy's Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne) to start the plan. As the Fantastic Four try to catch the Surfer, and Johnny has gained some merging power from him, they find out that his powers come from the board he rides, which helps him to go through things and fly. The heroes find out, with a little help from Dr. Doom, that it is not the Surfer to be afraid of, it is the creature that sent him that is more dangerous. In the end, the Surfer sacrifices himself and his board to destroy Galactus, Johnny loses his merging thing, and Reed and Susan can get married, very quickly before having to save some people. Also starring The Last King of Scotland's Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters, Beau Garrett as Captain Raye, André Braugher as General Hager, Zach Grenier as Mr. Sherman / Rafke and a cameo from Marvel comics master Stan Lee as a Rejected Wedding Guest. Gruffudd's American accent is a little improved, The Thing's eye- brow is bigger, and the Silver Surfer is quite a cool double-sided character. As for the film itself, there is about the same amount of action as the predecessor, and the special effects are also the same quality, so it's not bad viewing. Okay!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
7,Tweekums,Better than the first film,6,23 April 2010,"Having been disappointed with the first Fantastic Four I had fairly low expectations for this sequel, thankfully after a slightly weak start we got a better story where the stakes were higher and the action was more thrilling. While there is still a bit too much bickering between the four it seemed a bit toned down and was done in a more entertaining way. As a result of meeting the Silver Surfer every time Johnny Storm touches one of the other four he swaps powers with them, this leads to him almost preventing the others from rescuing people endangered when the London Eye is knocked off its axle when the surfer creates a mysterious hole in front of it which also drains the Thames. In their quest to stop the Surfer they are joined by Victor Von Doom who has returned after his defeat in the previous film, they don't trust him but with the world threatened they have little choice.This film was much stronger than the previous one; while we don't really learn enough about the Silver Surfer he made a better threat, largely because he wasn't motivated by greed or a quest for power. The best performance came from Andre Braugher who played General Hager, the man who brought in the Four and Doom to stop the Surfer. The returning cast members seemed to do a better job too although it probably helped that by now the characters are established so no time had to be wasted introducing them.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
8,ma-cortes,Again our friends Super-heroes use their supernatural powers to battle Galactus and Doctor Doom,6,6 February 2009,"This exciting second part has again the extraordinary quartet taking on the threats to the world with his incredible force. It begins when occur weird events on faraway planets .Meanwhile our friends are living of comfortable manner, as Reed Richards(Ioan Gruffud) and Sue Storm(Jessica Alba) are planning to marry themselves.

The amazing plot is pure entertainment and correctly based on characters created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, as usual appears in a sympathetic cameo. Atmospheric and appropriate musical score, fitting to action by John Ottman. Overwhelming production design , though full of digital effects by Petruccelli. Colorful cinematography by Larry Blanford and rousing visual and special effects by Weta Digital.The motion picture is professionally directed by Tim Story(Barber Shop, Taxi), first part's director.There are several rumors a following with Silver Surfer as starring but is hard to tell if that will happen.

9,BA_Harrison,The Fair to Middling Four,5,14 October 2007,"The Fantastic Four return for more superhero silliness in yet another big-budget FX-laden movie from Marvel, which sees Sue Storm and Reed Richards preparing to tie the knot. But with a mysterious metallic dude known as The Silver Surfer, zipping around the world on his shiny surfboard making huge holes in the Earth (preparing it for consumption by Galactus, a planet-eating alien being), successfully making it down the aisle is more difficult than they had imagined.More tongue in cheek than many of today's crop of superhero films (The X-Men and Spiderman trilogies, Superman Returns), the Fantastic Four movies have the potential to be huge fun. But Rise of the Silver Surfer still manages to be a rather disappointing effort thanks to its lacklustre script which delivers little in the way of genuine excitement.For starters, far too much of the film's (rather short) running time is spent concentrating on the impending nuptials of Sue and Reed, rather than delivering impressive action set-pieces, and, since The Silver Surfer isn't out to directly hurt or attack the foursome, at no point do we feel like they are in any particular danger. In fact, the metallic menace cannot really even be considered a 'baddie' since all he is doing is preparing a snack for his boss (who looks nothing like his comic incarnationthe movie Galactus is a nothing but a swirling cloud).The cast are distinctly average, each playing their character with plenty of enthusiasm but very little depth. At least Ioan Gruffudd and Chris Evans look the part; Michael Chiklis as The Thing, however, looks rather rubbery, whilst Jessica Alba is the least convincing due to the fact that a Latino actress with blonde hair and blue contacts just looks daft.As for the much heralded Silver Surfer, he is no more impressive than the T-1000 from Terminator 2 which James Cameron gave us over fifteen years ago. So much for advances in technology.As a mindless piece of popcorn entertainment, Rise of the Silver Surfer is just about passable; as a big-budget summer blockbuster, it falls a long way short.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
10,Quinoa1984,"not deep much at all, and it's happy that way- 'safe' doesn't necessarily mean terrible this time around",5,19 June 2007,"Rise of the Silver Surfer is like a three-part cartoon version put back into live-action on Saturday morning for kids. If I was a kid, I think I might have responded more, if only because I knew there could be some cool toys to get. It's a shallow diversion of an entertainment spectacle, but as far as others out there go- notably the prior installment in the F4 series- it could go a lot worse. This time the stories focused on three points: stopping the total annihilation of the world from Galactus- a super-duper space being that comes on like the biggest hurricane, as a big lumbering marvel of visual fx; the problems of being close together between Reed Richards and Sue Storm, and the rift ego and the good of the group causes among the four; and the Silver Surfer, and his connection invariably to the previous villain Victor Von Doom.None of this, unlike a Spider-Man or Batman movie, is very psychologically complex or rounded in a kind of perpetually existential comic-book way. But this time it's not exactly dull in seeing how our main heroes interact (even Johnny Storm isn't entirely annoying this time, as there's a little development about his obviously narcissistic edge), and how the media buzz around them encroaches right behind the Surfer and Doom. There's even a very funny bachelor party scene- not too explicit for PG of course- including a drunk joke with the Thing and some guy with an afro. If there are fun enough moments, it doesn't mean the flaws are there, even for one (like myself) who's never read a Silver Surfer comic.Doug Jones, who plays the Surfer, provides about a tenth of the skill and imagination he brought to his roles in Pan's Labyrinth, but it goes without saying that he's not given a really impressive villain to play. Hardcore fans be damned, this is a very simplistic creation, for the film anyway, where he goes about on his surfboard in T-1000 form (minus the knives). It's also a distraction to hear Surfer's few words spoken by Laurence Fishburne, who provides nothing except a deep-sounding vocal to a practically expressionless radioactive force. Doom, on the other hand, just provides a kind of extension of his egomania from the first film, only this time compounded by a devilish plan that makes no sense ('hey, let me ride on this board to mess around with F4 while the world will soon come to an end, that's smart'). It doesn't help matters that Tim Story, more often than not, is still coasting along as director, offering little by way of visual prowess or much understanding of what rises comic book adaptations to possible great art.But all this aside, I'm kind of not disappointed with Rise of the Silver Surfer on the whole. Notwithstanding another movie in the franchise that probably won't get any better, it's a reckless fun-house that keeps buoyant spirits and may have the fans of the original comics more pleased than with the first outing. At the least, there's an uproarious moment during a Chinese wedding, and maybe one of Stan Lee's best cameos to date (""It's Stan Lee!""). 5.5/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
11,hitchcockthelegend,Show off!,7,11 May 2010,"A sequel to 2005 box office winner, ""The Fantastic Four"", ""Rise Of The Silver Surfer"" sees director Tim Story and the original cast principals return for more super hero schlocky fun. The story is based around the Marvel stories that featured the first appearance of said ""Silver Surfer"" in the comic book franchise. Silver Surfer (Doug Jones with Laurence Fishburne dubbing the voice) is acting as a herald for the planet devouring Galactus, the next target? Earth. Which is a bit untimely as Reed Richards/Mr Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm/Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are trying to get married. Things are further problematic when after his first encounter with the Silver Surfer, Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Chris Evans) finds his powers a bit off - in fact when he touches any of the others I the team their powers are exchanged, much to Ben Grimm/The Thing's (Michael Chiklis) amusement. Not only that, but the military are starting to get heavy and annoyed with the four - and who is this back on the scene? Doctor Doom! (Julian McMahon) Thought he was dead, and how come he's in league with the military now? All of this issues must be addressed or the Earth will suffer the direst of consequences.Budgeted at $130 million, this sequel only just made its money back domestically, however, the Worldwide takings gave it an overall profit of nearly $160 million. Which when you consider that the first film (again raking the coin in) was met with very disdainful reviews (mostly warranted outside of Evans & Chiklis' efforts), it's somewhat surprising. Yet, and it's certainly no towering genre picture, ""Silver Surfer"" is a hugely enjoyable movie for fans of the source comics and the undemanding popcorn muncher. The fans, and I don't speak for all of them of course, should in the main be happy that the makers have been faithful to the origins of the story. There's also some nifty humour and both Alba and Gruffudd aren't as dull as they were in the first movie. Perhaps they are more comfortable now knowing that the paying public held sway over the critics?. Evans is still the best thing in the franchise (no surprise he would go on to play ""Captain America"" in ""The Avengers"" franchise), and the appearance of Andre Braugher as General Hager is a welcome edition. While the effects are considerably better than the poor fodder served up in the first movie - granted it wouldn't have been hard to improve on that score.With a lovely light hearted approach, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" does its job. In the pantheon of super hero movies it sits some where in the middle, neither great or bad, just honest wholesome family fun. 20th Century Fox have announced that a reboot of the franchise is to come, so while Chris Evans goes off to mouth wateringly play ""Captain America"", the next lot of actors are charged with the not so easy task of winning over a tough comic book crowd, and, the critics too. 6.5/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
12,preppy-3,Pretty poor sequel,4,20 June 2007,"The Silver Surfer (Doug Jones with the voice of Laurence Fishburne) is a man all in silver who whizzes around the Earth on a surfboard. He also spreads radiation and causes disasters everywhere he goes.

And Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman are trying to get married.The special effects are OK and Gruffudd and Chiklis are good--but that's about it for the good things about this. Some of the special effects are lousy--Mr. Fantastic's stretching looks so fake and why do his clothes stretch with him? Alba's acting is even worse than usual. Evans again seems to be holding back and not doing what he could as the Human Torch. Kerry Washington appears as Alicia Masters--but she's given no introduction. I don't remember her being in the first movie at all, and why is she black? She's white in the comic books. I'm not racist--it's just that you don't go around changing characters from comic books for no rhyme or reason. McMahon is given next to nothing to do as Doom--and what's with his hair (or lack of)? It looked terrible! The script is awful--it gets boring and there are far too many unexplained events (especially the end). SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! Galactus is in this--but he's not personified as he is in the comics. Here he's just some huge intergalactic force that consumes planets. It looks dumb and not at all impressive.The only really good thing I can say about this is it's fairly short--only 92 minutes. Still this is a boring, stupid and confusing movie.

13,poolandrews,Average comic book superhero film.,5,12 May 2010,"4: Rise of the Silver Surfer starts as scientists Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) & Susand Storm (Jessica Alba) prepare to marry, however Reed is contacted by General Hager (Andre Braugher) of the US military for help in tracking a strange meteorite that has caused several large scale environmental phenomena. Reed builds a sensor to track the strange meteor which in fact turns out to be a silver humanoid alien riding a powerful surfboard, this 'silver surfer' has been sent by a huge alien space cloud named Galactus that devours entire worlds & leaves them lifeless before moving on the the next & Earth is it's next target. The Fantastic Four seem powerless to stop Galactus but the alien silver surfer may hold the key to defeating Galactus & saving Earth but trying to convince him to help isn't going to be easy...This American, German, English & Canadian co-production was directed by Tim Story & while not the worst Marvel comic books superhero film out there it's not the best either & is a distinctly average entry that I found watchable enough I suppose but nothing amazing. While I have seen the original Fantastic Four (2005) I can't really remember it which says it all & in a week or two I doubt I will remember much, if anything, about 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Here the Fantastic Four return while the Silver Surfer turns up for the first time & Victor Von Doom also makes a reappearance from the original in a rather small & pointless role, the focus of the film is definitely the Silver Surfer & the evil Galactus who wants to eat the Earth. The Silver Surfer who is used by Galactus is touched by our humanity & decides to save Earth after the Fantastic Four at first try to stop him which leads to your CGI effects heavy set-pieces which are alright but not that exciting to be honest. The comics gave the Silver Surfer & Galactus much more background & while here there's not much mention of why the Silver Surfer helps Galactus it was probably deliberate, the problem with that it is it doesn't really satisfy anyone does it? The comic book fans are disappointed since the Silver Surfer is presented as rather shallow & non comic book fans will be just confused & unsure of whats going on. At a little over 90 minutes at least it's short & it moves along at a fast pace but Reed & Susan feel like an old married couple already, the Thing comes off like a comedy relief brick-house & the Human Torch is just annoying with his attitude while Dr. Doom is wasted in a nothing role. There are a few broadly painted sentiments here like just accepting who you are, believing in humanity, self sacrifice, making the right choice & trusting each other but they aren't exactly life changing & the sub-plot about the Fantastic Four swapping powers feels like a gimmick rather than anything else.One of the reasons I am not a huge fan of the whole superhero film is that comic book character's were designed to look good as a 2-D drawing on a blank piece of paper rather than in a live action film & again here some of the set-pieces & powers displayed are just silly. The part when Reed dances with two girls using his long twisting arms is daft & some of the CGI effects aren't that good either. The action scenes are alright, there are crashing helicopters, exploding planets, flying rockets, an alien silver surfer, explosions & in a scene set in London the London Eye comes crashing down. Keep watching as the end credits roll since there's an extra minute or so that hints that the Silver Surfer is not dead & why would he be when there's money to be made by film studios?With a supposed budget of about $130,000,000 this had a lot spent on it & it looks good, sure of the CGI looks like CGI but overall this has a slick Hollywood look about it. Filmed in various locations such as Shanghai, Canada, New York, England, Russia, Japan, Egypt & Germany. The acting is alright but no-one seems that interested, Alba is poor as a scientist while the Silver Surfer is voiced by Laurence Fishburne.4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a watchable family orientated Marvel comic book superhero film that doesn't have the dark edge that many do & isn't anything that memorable even though there's plenty of CGI action scenes in it. Apparently Silver Surfer (2012) is currently in production but no word of a third outing for the Fantastic Four themselves.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
14,dbborroughs,Better than the first film this is still a disappointment,6,17 June 2007,"While Sue and Reed prepare for their wedding, strange phenomena begin to happen all around the world. The strange happenings are the work of ""the Silver Surfer"", herald of Galactus who is coming to devour our planet. Its up to the Fantastic Four to stop the Surfer and Galactus before the earth is destroyed.I actually liked this film. It has more of the banter that made the comic fun to read, the action set pieces are cool and there is charm to it that manages to lift it all out of recent rash of dour comic films. I don't love the film as a whole but I do like the pieces very much.The problems for me come from two places. First the film is too short. The story cries out for a more epic telling with a better sense of place, but that isn't here. Sure the plot takes the characters around the world but there is very little sense of them ever being out of a back lot. Other than the London and New York scenes the film could have been filmed anywhere and so feels cheap or like a bumped up TV movie.The other problem is that I don't know how non comic fans are going to react. There seems to be an odd short hand which assumes that you know the comic. This is particularly true with the character development for the Surfer. His character is in many ways very close to the comic book one, except that you wouldn't know that unless you read the comic. He says almost nothing and is more or less just a silent sentinel. While this was fine for those who know the comic, my Dad and others seeing this with me were left a bit perplexed as to why the character went on to comic super stardom.Its not worth getting into the changes from the comic, Galactus in particular, since the movie seems intent on carving out its own niche.Worth seeing, though I would be hard pressed to say its worth 10 bucks a head (bargain matinée or DVD anyone?).",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
15,Bunuel1976,"Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer (Tim Story, 2007) **1/2",6,15 July 2007,"While slightly superior to the original, this is still essentially bland and juvenile stuff  and entirely forgettable once it's over. The film is obviously a special effects bonanza and sees the emergence of a new anti-hero (as opposed to an out-and-out villain  that requirement is filled by the reappearance of the Four's old nemesis, Dr. Von Doom, with whom they're forced to collaborate in order to 'understand' the Silver Surfer!). Certainly the most novel and engaging element about the plot is the fact that, on contact with the alien, our superheroes are able to exchange 'gifts'. On the debit side, the Surfer's ominous ruler is a big disappointment when it finally makes its very belated appearance, the military personnel are pompous and downright obnoxious (ditto Chris Evans' relentless strutting and inane antics) but, thankfully, Jessica Alba is on hand to provide the redeeming and expected eye candy.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
16,utgard14,Watchable But Disappointing,5,30 May 2014,"Another disappointing Fantastic Four movie. The returning cast is fine, I guess, considering how the characters are written. Johnny's a bit more of a jerk, Ben's a bit dumber, and Reed has a stupid dance scene that should have resulted in someone being fired. But most of that is the script and direction, not the actors. For her part, Jessica Alba portrays Sue as less of a ditz this time around. Although the ridiculous blue contacts are distracting and unnecessary. Julian McMahon is back as someone they're calling Dr. Doom. They conveniently find a reason to allow him to act without a mask or makeup. Andre Braugher has a thankless role as a clichéd Army general with an ax to grind with Reed.The special effects are spotty. Sometimes they are passable, sometimes dreadful, but never are they great. The Silver Surfer is a CGI character interacting with flesh & blood actors in a real-world environment and the tech just wasn't there in 2007 to pull that off convincingly. At all times, you are very aware that he is fake. It's like having a cartoon mixed in with real people, a la Roger Rabbit. This is not the fault of Doug Jones or Laurence Fishburne. The biggest disappointment is in the presentation of Galactus. They obviously didn't have the budget to do Galactus properly so instead we get some vague cloud entity thing. It's the kind of thing comic book fans learned to expect from television shows like Smallville with limited resources, not a major film release.This movie is a real disservice to the original Lee & Kirby Galactus story, perhaps the best of all Fantastic Four stories. It highlights a fundamental problem with Tim Story's Fantastic Four movies. For what he gets right about the characters (the family dynamic, some of the characterizations, a lighter tone), he gets more wrong. There is never a sense of the fantastic about these films. They don't explore anything, nor do they introduce new characters, worlds, and ideas in any kind of impressive way. They're just people with super powers doing stuff. With very little effort, you could change the names and powers of the characters and not alter the story in any significant way. On the positive side, the movie does have a lot of humor and the main cast are likable actors all. I just wish they had been given a decent script and a serious attempt at making a quality FF movie instead of this. It's watchable but nothing better than that.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
17,zardoz-13,Tops The Original,10,20 June 2007,"""The Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (**** out of ****) qualifies as fabulous, often funny, family-friendly fare. Not only does the second installment in the far-fetched, formula-driven, Marvel Comics fantasy franchise provide a refresher course for those who've forgotten the first film, but this Twentieth Century Fox release also introduces a new character. This time around Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Childis) tangle with a villain that dwarfs even the maniacally evil Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) and find themselves struggling to save the Earth from an apocalypse like nothing that they faced in the original. The computer-generated special effects are first-rate, unlike those in ""Spider-Man 3,"" but the CGI as well as the apocalyptic plot never overshadow the characters and the tensions that their comic camaraderie conjures up. Invisible Girl Sue Storm still scolds rubbery Mr. Fantastic Reed Richards about his nerdy obsession for all things scientific, while incendiary Johnny Storm cannot rib the granite-hard Ben Grimm enough about his stony countenance. Director Tim Story, who helmed the breezy lightweight original, knows one thing that other summer movie directors could learn. Namely, too much of a good thing is not always a good thing. Clocking in at a short and snappy 89 minutes, the new ""Fantastic Four"" adventure allows you barely enough time to drain a barrel-sized soft drink before you have to drain something else.""The Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer"" opens ominously enough as an unknown power plows its way inexorably through the galaxy and destroys one planet after another to assuage its awesome appetite for energy. While this mystifying might is wending its way toward Earth, everybody on the planet is counting down the hours to the most anticipated marriage in history between Reed Richards and Sue Storm. Eventually, the strange force from another galaxy enters Earth's atmosphere. This inexplicable anomaly shocks Japanese sailors in Suruga Bay, Japan, when it solidifies the waters that they fish in and then surprises tourists in Giza, Egypt, when it sprinkles snow flakes on the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx. Flashing like a white-hot meteor over Los Angeles, it plunges the City of Angels into a startling black-out. The Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon interpret this meteorological mayhem as a military threat, and they dispatch blunt General Hager (Andre Braugher of TV's ""Homicide"") to solicit the help of Reed Richards. The Pentagon wants to know where this force will strike next. Reed agrees on the sly to create a sensor that will detect it while he prepares for his upcoming marriage to Sue.Sue and Reed are poised in front of the preacher when the bizarre comet strikes New York City, turns their lavish Manhattan wedding into chaos, and melts down Reed's sensor apparatus without warning. Reluctantly, Johnny Storm incinerates his wedding tuxedo to pursue the object. No sooner has Johnny launched himself into flight like a fireball than the intruder assumes the form of a chrome-plated Ken doll riding a metallic surf board. This extraterrestrial literally takes Johnny by surprise and seizes him by the throat in a death grip and then escorts him into outer space. The Human Torch cries uncle, and his opponent allows him to plunge back to Earth. This encounter affects Johnny adversely because he can no longer confine his power to himself. He touches The Thing at one point, and The Thing turns into The Human Torch. Vice-versa, Johnny transforms hilariously into the Thing. Later, Johnny touches Sue, and she bursts into flames while he vanishes. Unbeknownst to our heroes, the Silver Surfer took a short-cut earlier over Latveria, where Victor Von Doom had been exiled for the duration at the end of the first film, and thawed out the evildoer. Initially, nothing that the Fantastic Four does thwarts the Silver Surfer, so General Hager invites Victor, much to the chagrin of our heroes, to help out. Victor reveals that the source of the enigmatic Surfer's power lies in his surfboard. Reed concocts a pulse gadget that our heroes to hope to separate the Surfer (a CGI effect with the husky voice of ""Matrix"" star Laurence Fishburne) from his surf board. Meanwhile, despite his willingness to help his former foes, Victor has something else up his sleeve that augurs ill for everybody.Indeed, the formulaic Don Payne & Mark Frost screenplay is pure ""Fantastic Four"" with the usual time out allotted for our ensemble's amusing antics with each other as well as some new gadgets. Reed Richards' elastic gyration on the dance floor with a couple of babes on either arm during his stag party generates a side-splitting sight gag. Only one character of importance perishes in this sequel but his demise is rather grisly considering the PG-rating. Nevertheless, director Tim Story never lets the action take a breather and keeps things bang-slamming ahead to an explosive finale. Reportedly, the two ""Fantastic Four"" movies have remained largely faithful to its Stan Lee and Jack Kirby origins more than any other series, and durable Stan makes another cameo as himself. Predictably, this enjoyable entry winds up with a happy ending that leaves things open for another sequel.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
18,Boba_Fett1138,Better than the first movie but still suffers from some of the same problems.,6,6 April 2008,"What I sometimes like about sequels is that they make seem that the film-makers have learned from their previous mistake during the last movie. This was previously for instance the case with the other superhero movies ""X2"", which was a better movie than ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man 2"", which was better than the first movie. This movie also learned from some of its mistakes it previous made in ""Fantastic Four"". Well, not all though.What it definitely learned was that it needed some more fun in it. The movie is more entertaining to watch and there is some more comedy to enjoy as well this time.Unfortunately the story is just as weak and gets also brought just as weak as was the case with the previous. The main plot just never gets developed good enough and the movie seems too much in love with its four main characters. The ending just also seems to come out of nowhere because of that, since how, when, why just never got explained good enough. Luckily it has the Silver Surfe in it this time, who still nice to spice up things.There also is some more action but it also gives you the feeling it is not enough or it certainly isn't big enough.The special effects have definitely been improved this time, which makes the movie more convincing to watch. Also the make-up for The Thing seemed to had been even more improved but Jessica Alba's chest on the other hand was still as distracting as ever, which is not a bad thing though.Basically all the characters from the first movie return and then there are also some new additions to the cast this time. The Silver Surfer is a welcome addition and he is a good looking and also interesting character. But you can wonder if it was necessary for the movie to bring Dr. Doom back. You sort of feel that the only reason they included his character was because when was being hinted at a sequel, during the previous movie, it was hinted that his character had survived. But you can actually really wonder if his character for this movie really adds anything and was necessary at all.Just basically some good simple fun, as long as your expectations for it aren't too high.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
19,view_and_review,"Silver Surfer Shines, Fantastic Four Don't",7,19 June 2007,"Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer (FFRSS) was a decent comic book movie. The story was decent, and the graphics for the Silver Surfer were most excellent (as Bill and Ted would say). Plus, I really liked the use of Lawrence Fishburne's voice for the Silver Surfer, he was the perfect choice. I honestly wished Silver Surfer got more screen time. You would think that four super heroes are better than one, but the best scene is when the Human Torch acquired the powers of his team mates and went solo against Dr. Von Doom. And speaking of Von Doom... why bring him back? Were the Fantastic Four short on arch enemies? Nemesies only keep coming back in Saturday morning cartoons that need to keep an enemy to stay on air.I realize that my moderate admiration of FFRSS is due to the bar being raised too high. Even with the awesome CGI in FFRSS, I wasn't all that interested in the unique abilities of any of the FF with the exception of Johnny Storm (maybe it is the childhood pyromaniac in me). It's just that movies like Spider Man and the X-Men have set a high bar for superhero abilities and even super battles. FFRSS was better than Spider Man 3 and that was only because they didn't make a huge soap opera out of Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl's wedding, unlike the drawn out romantic escapade between Peter Parker and M.J.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

While the special effects are more eye-popping than the first film, the storyline is still hindered by really laughable dialogue by Don Payne, Mark Frost and John Turman's screenplay yet the cast seems to be more animated this go around. It's also a cool CGI bonus of the Silver Surfer getting his silver screen debut even if it is second banana status. (Dir: Tim Story)",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
21,neil-476,Norrin Radd rules!,9,18 June 2007,"Yes, if you liked 1 you'll like 2 and if you didn't, you won't (and you won't like it if you expect to see the source material faithfully reproduced without tweakage). And I didn't see any Galactus helmet silhouette anywhere apart from a couple of points where I kind of almost persuaded myself a bit that I might have seen something which kind of reminded me a bit of what it might look like if it had been there except maybe I was just imagining it.But what of the film itself? Well, don't expect any deep themes - there's the underlying theme of family, of course, but it's gentle and understated. And don't expect profound subtext - there's Johnny taking on some responsibility when it counts, of course, and the Surfer fighting his ""programming"" in order to do the right thing, but these are simply part of the story, and not nailed up as an object lesson.They got the group dynamic right in the first film, and that still holds strongly in this one - no messing with a successful bit of the formula. Doom - well, I simply have to get used to the fact that the Dr Doom in these movies is an entirely different character to the one in the comics. An OK villain, but a lightweight. And he doesn't speak with a Bela Lugosi accent.Galactus - I can cope with the cloud. It works, in this context. The film has a cosmic menace, but it deals with it by reference to its effect on people. You get a glimpse of the cosmicness, but the people are the important thing.The Surfer is nailed perfectly. They have captured the air of injured nobility, of tragic predetermination, in both Doug Jones' physical performance and Laurence Fishburne's voice-over. This is Norrin Radd, in every way. And for those who raised the Chrome Surfer criticism, that's dealt with too - he is indeed silver for much of the film, it's only when he's powered up that he becomes reflective.Don't expect depth, expect fun - 92 minutes of action-packed Fantastic Four comic. This is EXACTLY what I would expect a comic movie to give me. It is much more entertaining than the overly angst-ridden Spidey 3. My parents, who rated FF1 very highly (more so than the Spidey movies, and on a par with the X-Men movies) will love it, my son (23) loved it, and I loved it too.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
22,evanston_dad,"Flame On, Guys! (Wasn't That a Song by the Village People?)",7,25 June 2007,"I'm used to being in the minority when it comes to movies. But usually, I hate movies that everyone else seems to love. It's much rarer that there will be a movie almost universally disliked, but which I actually enjoyed. ""Fantastic Four"" is one of those.Maybe by the time I saw this I was just sick of all the brooding, psychologically complex superheroes out there and found a good old-fashioned cheesy comic book movie refreshing. What I like about this story is that the Fantastic Four have their superpowers foisted on them, and then have to figure out how to use them. They have a regular Joe quality to them that makes them easier to relate to. They don't have sinister back stories full of murdered parents, ugly childhoods, seething feelings of revenge. They're just geeky scientists who can do pretty cool things.People seem to be responding to the second installment, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" marginally better than they did the first, but I like both of them. After the overblown mess that was the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy and all of the dithery angst that filled Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman"" series, it's nice to sit back and let 90 minutes of fun, worry free action adventure cleanse the palate.Grade: A-",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
23,ferguson-6,Let's Go Surfing,6,17 June 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Tim Story and the entire gang are back from the first film only this time the Silver Surfer adds a touch of class. The initial chase scene with Johnny Storm and the Surfer makes the film worth the price of admission.Yes, there is a bit too much relationship mush and scientific mumbo-jumbo, but this group was never meant to be an overly charismatic group except when they are saving the world. I will say, Jessica Alba seems a bit more annoying this time around, both in her fake tan looks and her whiny-bride act. Still, it is fun when they go into full ""fantastic"" mode.Laurence Fishburne is the voice of the Silver Surfer and all scenes involving this fascinating character are a bit more exciting than the rest. Ion Gruffudd, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis fill out the rest of the FOUR, and Julian McMahon is back from the dead as Victor Von Doom.

The Thing and Johnny Storm now get along with each other, and Sue Storm is now planning to be Mrs. Fantastic. Galactus, an evil creature in space, has decided that Earth is it's new target, and sends a being known as the Silver Surfer to destroy it. Richards and his team must now capture this surfer, and even team up with one individual who they didn't expect to help. Who's surname rhymes with Boom....This was the last Marvel film to be released before they built the Marvel world we all know and love now, so when you think about it, Fantastic Four is the black sheep in the Marvel family.Albeit a bonkers fun black sheep. Its a mess, no doubt about it, but it looks good, it's never dull and to be honest, its a step up from the previous movie. In a world now where everyone who makes a comic book movie tries to make the next Iron Man or Dark Knight, films like this, big dumb ones are a thing of the past.Some people would probably prefer this, but I'm old fashioned and very once in a while I like to watch a load of old cobblers to take my mind away from the seriousness of the world, which is ironic, seeing that the villain in this Is an eater of worlds.Story isn't a very good director, but he can put the money on the screen, and the cast are as you would expect, Evans being the best thing, Macmohan looking seriously like he's on cold turkey, and Alba, well she's very easy to look at isn't she?All in all, its a load of old rubbish, but its fun rubbish, that doesn't take its self seriously.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
25,Aaron1375,"Not only does the Silver Surfer rise, but also the rest of the Fantastic Four.",9,22 June 2007,"This is a summer movie to be sure. It has action, comedy, and a little heart as well. It is not going to win awards, it is not going to be hailed as a cinematic masterpiece, but it is still a very good movie. Add to that it is also short, something all summer movies should aspire to do. Granted, when first I heard of the running time I thought for sure this film would be underdeveloped, however my fears proved groundless as this movie's story was very well done with no loose ends unlike some movie's this year that ran nearly twice as long. I liked it better than the first movie as the comedy was funny and the action was rather nice too. The story has a mysterious force on Earth causing a bit of havoc as water is turned to glass and snow in the deserts. Even strange occurrences happen in Lateveria which is trouble for all. The Fantastic Four though are trying to make a wedding happen while balancing being super heroes and celebrities. The army wants Reed's help to track the force and Reed does, though without Susan's knowledge. Well the big wedding day occurs and it is promptly interrupted by a mysterious being seemingly made of Silver and riding what appears to be a surf board. The Fantastic Four must stop this being and find out his motivations before there is real trouble. Though they do get help in the form of Dr. Doom, which let's face it is probably going to be trouble later on. So yes, there is some good action, comedy and very good special effects. A great fight at the end with who you want to see the Fantastic Four fighting and a nifty climax featuring a very close call.

Michael Chiklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon return as The Thing, the Human Torch and Dr. Doom respectively, not to mention Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters. Andre Braugher and Beau Garrett are on hand as General Hager and Capt. Frankie Raye.I've been a fan of the Fantastic Four since my childhood and felt that the 2005 movie was a very good set-up for the series despite fumbling the ball with Dr. Doom and a mediocre action climax. With the presence of the Silver Surfer and Galactus I was expecting a great sequel, but it was not to be. The first half is quite good, however, with the main cast comfortable in their roles and obviously having a good time. But something goes awry in the second half where the proceedings get dull. It's hard to pinpoint the problem, but clearly they needed to work some kinks out in the script. On the positive side, Dr. Doom is better portrayed than in the first film. Despite my criticisms, there's enough good here to give ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" a lukewarm 'thumbs up,' just don't expect greatness.The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in British Columbia, California, New York City, Germany (The Black Forest), China, Japan and Greenland.GRADE: B-",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,9,15 June 2007,"I've written almost two years ago that I adored the movie adaptation of Fantastic Four, despite many out there who hated it to the core. Back then, what I found was right about it was its spot on characterization and its capture of the spirit which was FF, the bickering amongst its members as well as its theme on unity and family. I'm surprised that I actually predicted the coming of Galactus, though some would be disappointed with his big screen appearance.Don't kid yourself if you say that you didn't see Galactus coming. As its herald, no Silver Surfer story is complete without the arrival of the master wanting to devour planets to keep itself alive (kinda reminds me of the other Transformer animated movie with Unicron). However, purists would go up in arms at the depiction of possibly one of the largest being in the Marvel Universe, which I thought was a better alternative in the movie without making it look too stupid with its ridiculous purple tin helmet.And what is a Silver Surfer story without Victor Von Doom showing interest in its immense power? While you might think that the movie might have too many villains, with Galactus, Doom and the Surfer (well, for the most parts), and with 4 heroes in the fray, Rise of the Silver Surfer managed to maintain a breezy pace without getting too deep into its themes nor suffer from having to introduce in detail its characters. We've already established most of that in the first movie, and the details of the Surfer and its master was just enough to enlighten new fans, while keeping older fans happy enough with its accuracy.So it's much like the comic book again, with our family of four having to deal with first of all, the rock star like atmosphere of the marriage between Mr Fantastic and Invisible Girl, before the Silver Surfer's rude arrival causing major climate changes in cities around the world, and of course, trusting the USoA army to wanna play world police again. This movie is not without obvious flaws though in continuity and logic in its narrative. For one, while its big action scenes take place in busy parts of the world, the crowd usually gets dispersed in record time. I believe some parts of the action were chopped off to prevent it from being overly draggy, but therein some logic and crowd magically disappear. Some parts too will make you wonder why doesn't the Invisible Girl just knock everyone out with her invisible projectiles, or groan that the make up artist managed to make Jessica Alba look like a fashion disaster with her unnaturally dyed-blonde hair. She looks hot when it's all tied up, but when it's let down, I tell you it's time for some shampoo ad to do some major corporate sponsorship.But I still got a kick out of its humorous moments (not that it was so funny, but they had charm), and I can't get enough of the banter between the Thing and the Human Torch. One thing's for certain, while the acting might not be first class, the cast of Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis (with the help of the suit) sure looked their parts. And that in itself, is movie magic bringing comic book panels to life. Look out too for Stan Lee, whom I think for the first time in the recent slew of Marvel movie adaptations, actually play himself!Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer brings back the best elements in the first movie, and provides an avenue for more of such adventures with the familiar quartet. It's a popcorn movie, and one which entertains throughout its relatively short 90 minutes duration. And I'll stick my neck out and say it again, this is probably one of the better movie franchises that Marvel has put out so far. Given the way things are set up, if this movie still proves to be a box office success, may I now say that we can expect to see the Mole Man next?",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Entertaining, but oh-so-cheesy and predictable",5,3 October 2007,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, was supposed to be one of the big summer events, but over all didn't make it as huge of an impact as expected, but I was hearing pretty good things from my friends who saw it. But I wanted to wait for the rental since I really wasn't into the first one, the first one just was so silly and didn't keep my attention. I have to say that Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer was definitely better than I expected and so much better than the original Fantastic Four, but I think I will probably skip out on the next sequel, this just isn't my type of super hero story. But that's the way Marvel has always been, very cheesy and silly, but the hero's always save the day. I think also I'm having a problem since Jessica Alba is getting nothing but the ""hot factor"" publicity lately, so I can't help but be sarcastic during her scenes where it seems like she really can't act, no offense to her. But Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is just glitzy effects with a fun story.The fantastic four are back and Sue and Reed are about to get married, but that is quickly interrupted when a planet eating rock is about to destroy their world. The Silver Surfer is destroying country by country and when they get ahold of him they know his surfing board is the source of his power and if put into the wrong hands, well, things could just get so much worse. But the fantastic four ban together to save the world once again.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is definite entertainment, a lot of special effects and a decent story, but the actors are still not that great in my opinion. I feel actually so bad because I know there are a lot of comic book fans who love this kind of story and grew up with the fantastic four, but I guess I should just stick to Batman, I prefer the darker stuff, for super hero's I always thought that yeah, they should have some cheesiness to the story, but not when it takes over the whole film, you know?

31,Buddy-51,hit-and-miss sequel,5,16 June 2007,"I have to admit to being one of only a tiny handful of people who DIDN'T think ""The Fantastic Four"" was a terrible movie. Frankly, even though I could tell that it wasn't a particularly GOOD movie, still I rather enjoyed its breezy unpretentiousness and lighthearted refusal to take itself too seriously. However, I'm not really sure that this material was exactly crying out for further amplification, and, indeed, the inevitable sequel, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" is an only sporadically engaging entry in the ever-expanding and now preposterously overcrowded field of comic book superhero movies.Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben return as the chemically-altered crime fighters, who in between battling evildoers and dodging celebrity-hunting paparazzi, are bent on living as normal a life as their phenomenal superpowers and the demands of their adoring, star struck public will allow. Achieving such normalcy is easier said than done, however, for on the day when Reed and Sue are finally about to officially tie the knot and utter their ""I do's,"" in on a celestial surfboard rides a silver-clad gentleman from the farthest reaches of outer space determined to wreak havoc on the planet.The film may not have much going for it in the plot department, but that Silver Surfer is sure one gnarly dude, and the filmmakers have done a truly ""fantastic"" job bringing him to life on screen. It's enough to make one wish they would change the quartet to a quintet for the next inevitable go-round. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba as Reed and Sue are once again reduced to playing ""straight men"" to Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis' Johnny and Ben, who, in true second-banana fashion, walk off with all the good lines in the film. The humor is mainly of the schoolyard-banter variety, but there are a few zippy zingers sprinkled in amongst the predictable cluster of clunkers. The same cannot be said for the ""serious"" dialogue, however, which often drips with maudlin sentimentality and homiletic self-importance.Director Tim Story has filmed the flying scenes for maximum speed and effectiveness, and the locales have, for the most part, been well-chosen and well-photographed. The special effects are seamless and even awe-inspiring on occasion, although the shots of Reed expanding his rubberized limbs to enormous lengths do look a bit fake at times.If nothing else, it's at least a lot shorter than ""Spider-Man 3"" (barely over ninety minutes).

It may be pretty to look at, but there's nothing compelling or interesting under the surface. The people in the movie don't necessarily act as much as react to CGI effects.

33,Robert_duder,The typical sequel pulls off watchable but still hurts the series,6,1 July 2007,"As stated at the end of my Fantastic 4 review it was practically a given that a sequel would follow the 2005 film and sure enough it did. But can you make a sequel to an already average superhero film that bases itself more towards kids and campy cartoony super powers?? Well certainly they were going to try and much to my surprise for the most part they pull off a better than expected sequel considering they had no origin to deal with. They did so by bringing in The Silver Surfer who turns out to be the best part of this average sequel and a very cool character who probably could have held his own film. Tim Story returns to direct the sequel which was also a plus because he knew the direction to take it and the characters and how to properly set everything up. That being said you can't build a stellar sequel off of an already very average film so that sequel ended up being a little more average.All of the original cast returns...some better than others. Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis are the Fantastic Four respectively. Chiklis is still the highlight as the overwhelming brute strength 'Thing' or 'Ben Grimm.' Jessica Alba did her best to look a little more like the Sue Storm that comic book goers enjoy after getting some flack because she 'looked nothing like her.' She does a decent job and in fact gets some great lines and scenes and pretty much steals the show. Evans returns as Johnny Storm who really was a forefront character in the original but they toned him down a little for the sequel, he still gets a lot of scenes including the first fight with The Silver Surfer but he's not quite as large and loud as he was in the original. Gruffudd kind of gets most of the script and screen time as Mr. Fantastic (Reed Richards.) He is just very bland and with his powers being the most cartoony and kid like it doesn't exactly help to take his character seriously. He doesn't really impress me in the role or throughout the film. Julian McMahon returns rather forcefully as Victor Von Doom and I mean forcefully because it was like they had to really push themselves to find a way to bring him back. His terrific performance in the original film made for a great bad guy and they kind of moved him to the back burner for the sequel but made sure he was there just for the sake of being there and that's unfortunate. The incredible Doug Jones who is not very recognizable because he is using his incredible talents to portray monsters, beasts, imps, zombies and creatures of all kind plays the physical Silver Surfer while Laurence Fishburne does the Surfer's voice. Jones is just an awesome talent and does such a terrific job with very specific movements and body language and is not afraid to hide his visage behind make up or CGI or anything else. He very well may be one of the acting greats in this capacity. Fishburne's voice definitely suits the Surfer and is terrific.The Silver Surfer visually and with plot line single handedly makes Fantastic 4: Rise of The Silver Surfer worthwhile. Sadly the Fantastic 4 themselves really doesn't add anything to the film and the visual effects are impressive but still sub par considering the short story and everything happening so fast. Maybe as many critic suggested they are trying to turn themselves more into a kid franchise and that makes sense and young kids probably will enjoy it more than an adult but magnificent children's epics like Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, and even Pixar films this still falls short of anything more than average. It's a renter for the kids or maybe even wait until it appears on Television because seeing it in the theater doesn't make it any more impressive. Average all around. 6.5/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
34,Lejink,Light fantastic,5,21 December 2007,"Undemanding, sit-back, in-flight entertainment, which is in fact where I viewed this comic-book sequel. I am a comic book fan (more a DC than Marvel guy, I must say) and so can accept this type of fantasy film if the notion takes me. The Fantastic Four seem on the whole to be a much lighter subject than such complex individuals as the troubled Batman and Spider Mans of this imaginary world and so the film must be accepted at a much lower level. The characterisations are about as thin as comic-strip paper, the humour forced and of course it's product placement all the way but the story rattles along with special effects (of a decidedly mixed quality) in almost every other scene. The actors barely merit mention, playing their clothes (should that be costumes) adequately and I also thought the Stan Lee cameo as stilted as it was unnecessary. As I stated above, the SFX are good only in patches, the computer generated Silver Surfer fairly leaps out of the screen and comes off best overall but Mr Fantastic's stretching capabilities seem to, well, overstretch the director and his team. In summary, I think I'd have preferred to have read a half dozen or so FF mags in the time it took to watch this big-screen adaptation but I can't and won't complain overmuch.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
35,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Cheesier and more clichéd than the first but, as such, far more memorable.",5,17 April 2018,"'Fantastic 4: Rise Of The Silver Surfer (2007)' is generally more interesting than the first even if it is less intelligent and takes a number of glaring missteps in terms of both its tone and treatment of certain source elements. Once the actual superhero stuff gets underway, it's just as passively enjoyable as the franchise was initially, though sadly just as camp too. It was around the time that Mr. Fantastic's computer-generated arms 'Mr. Tickled' themselves around two 'bodacious babes' and awkwardly reeled them in during a far too long and far too uncomfortable dance sequence set at his stag party that I realised what I was in for: an experience perhaps even cheesier and more clichéd than the original. That does mean that, for better or worse, it is actually far more memorable. 5/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
36,bowmanblue,A bit like the 'Human Torch',6,7 January 2015,"The first big screen outing for the 'Fantastic Four' hardly set the Box Office alight. Therefore a lot of people were actually quite surprised when they were afforded a second attempt. So... did they get it right the second time around? Well, sort of. Like my title states – this film is a bit like one of the Four themselves, i.e. hot and cold.I always felt the first film only really got going in its dying stages. Both movies are no more than an hour and a half in length and the first one only really sees the Four coming together to fight their nemesis, Dr Doom, in literally the last ten minutes. So, I was kind of hoping this one would continue the battle most of the way through. Sadly, it didn't. Everything kind of goes back to how it was before – the four heroes bicker among themselves and then have to use their combined powers to save a cat up a tree (or something – I may have made that one up, but you get the idea).Now, instead of just Dr Doom, we now have three baddies to contend with. However, none of them really do muc that's bad throughout the best part of the movie. We have the Silver Surfer (voiced a bit by Laurence Fishburne) who just kind of flies about a bit and causes power cuts. Dr Doom is still on the scene, but after the whole of the first film was spent turning him into Dr Doorm, he promptly drops his iron mask and cape and returns to a guy with slightly effeminate eyebrows (who has borrowed Emperor Palpadine's lightening fingertip powers). Finally we have Gallactus (I think that's how you spell it). In the comics he's a giant robot who eats planets. Now he's a kind of giant puff of smoke who travels through space squeezing worlds (and you only see him in the last quarter of an hour or so).So, without – what I would call – 'real' villains, do the heroes carry the film? Again, not really. Ioan Gruffudd may be a decent enough actor (and look the part of Reed Richards), but he's not really (action) leading man material. And, if that wasn't bad enough, the special effects used to extend his limbs always look a bit ropey. Jessica Alba looks cute, but does little else, Michael Chiklis is probably the best, utilising his decent 'Thing' make-up to add weight to his character while Chris Evans kind of just uses these films as a warm-up for his Captain America superhero outing.I first saw the Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer when it came out in 2006. I have just watched it again in 2015. Baring that in mind I'd forgotten enough of it to make it okay for a second viewing. And, if I was bored and fancied something that wasn't quite up to the 'Marvel universe' movies such as Iron Man, Thor and the Avengers, I'd probably watch both Fantastic Four movies again in another nine years.Kids will probably like it the most. It does have a couple of good action scenes that gets your blood pumping, but, like the human torch, just when it heats up, it cools down equally as quickly.Probably better than the first one, but only just.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
37,MLDinTN,just a little better than the first film,5,17 May 2008,"This movie was very average. The special effects were OK, certainly nothing great. The story may have been a little better than the first film, but still it's nothing great. An alien, referred to the Silver Surfer, because he gets his power from a surfboard comes to earth. They learn that once the surfer is on a planet for 8 days, that planet is destroyed. The surfer is far more powerful than the fantastic 4, but they devise a plan to separate him from the surfboard. Dr. Doom comes back and very predictably is after the surfboard. They learn the surfer really doesn't want to destroy earth, but is forced to by another entity. The fantastic four persuade the surfer to help them out and try to save earth.The acting is not very good, and there is no suspense. It's just not well written.FINAL VERDICT: Not really worth seeing.

38,Cineanalyst,Nothing Fantastic Here: An Ordinary Sequel,3,12 September 2020,"I'm surprised the first ""Fantastic Four"" (2005) was financially successful enough to make this equally, if not more so, dull sequel, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer."" At least, audiences had seen enough by then for another installment to be cancelled, although that wouldn't prevent the 2015 reboot dud. Being a relatively early entry in the emerging superhero genre of the 21st century, the action tends to receive a light treatment--comic books for kids stuff--despite the usual alien-invasion, impending planetary catastrophe plot (cosmic rays and dust that nevertheless appear to have no adverse effects on the solar system included). This one doesn't even have the interest of the characters discovering their powers.Even for a light treatment, however, the rom-com junk involving Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman struggling to pull off their elaborate wedding plans is vapid. You know, you can get married without a wedding, and cultural appropriation is hardly a ""better idea""--it's so random, too: since when did any of these characters demonstrate an interest in Japanese culture? In the movies, at least, it appears to be just this one scene. On the plus side, I suppose, Jessica Alba wearing a kimono distracts from the blonde wig they put on her (it's pretty bad when these movies can't even prevent hair from being distracting--the 2015 reboot had the same problem, among others, with the same character). This comic-book flick is worse than stupid, though; it's wholly without interest.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Then, an unexpected visitor from outer space interrupts the proceedings. The four heroes along with the military and the venomous Doom must stop the mysterious Silver Surfer from destroying the planet. The acting in this film is great and possibly better than the first one. Doug Jones/Laurence Fishburne did a great job as the Silver Surfer. Ottman's music is good with a couple of great tunes. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm is hilarious. I hope that there is another sequel to this thrilling, great special-effects film. I rate this film a 10/10.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

43,tabuno,Not Very Compelling Entertainment,6,21 January 2019,"16 June 2007. Unlike other superhero sequels this year, this one spluttered and fell short. It was obvious that efforts were made at humor to move the movie along and at times it was hilarious but most of the time, the pacing was slow and boring. There wasn't a lot original - just a lot of moving around and action sequences. The dialogue seemed pretty lame and dumb - perhaps it's more the comic book story itself than the movie. Efforts were made to give the movie more substance, drama which flickered into interesting possibilities, but never sustained. While the movie was fairly clear, the plot reasonably outlined and played out, the compelling component of the movie didn't emerge, particularly for an adult audience. Somewhat predictable, this sequel moved more of stereotypical characters without much depth, more along the line of Star Troopers (1997).",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Michael Chikilis is solid as The Thing, but once again Julian McMahon is dire. He has never been a good actor. Though he did manage to convince Dannii Minogue he loved her enough, for her to finance (to the point of almost bankruptcy) his attempts at an acting career, so maybe I'm misjudging him, and I've just never sen him be good in anything!!

I enjoyed FF a lot but i think this one tops it. The characters blend much better with each other and there is more detail. Its doesn't seem as funny but id say there's more action than in FF. The negative about this movie is that should have put more fight scenes.The beginning starts off kinda slow but than the movie picks up the pace and gets better. The movie gets much better when the Silver Surfer spots Susan in the desert and they start talking. After that, the movie seems much more fun and gets to the point better and easier. I love the final battle between the fantastic 4 and Victor, that was sweet when Johnny combined all the rest of the members powers with his so he can have all their powers. The very ending where Reed and Sue get married in Asian is pretty much how the movie begins but anyways it takes off from there. I also like how Johnny and Ben got along more but i was cheesed because Ben's ""blind black bit**"" is back. I also hated that army guy (forgot his name). He was so annoying and ruined the movie. While watching the film, you can tell that there is gonna be a third installment. I cant wait for to come out, its gonna be dope.Anyways, id recommend this movie, its real good, many of the negative comments are bs and are lies..this series is very underrated IMO.As a rewatch 08/14/19' and after rewatching the original Fantastic Four (2005) for the first time in a long while, opinions upon both films are slightly altered.

When the group encounter strange phenomenas in certain parts of the worlds, the closest thing that can happen, will certainly hit home. I liked the part when Johnny Storm went after the Surfer and the touch affect his powers. When he touched his sister, he was out of sight, she was just hot. The embarrassment occurred when she landed naked, as usual! The real cool scene is when he got Thing's power. Ben Grimm got the last laugh. The bachelor party scene was cool. Reed really got the party started when he loosened up. The return of Dr. Victor Von Doom(Julian McMahon) was inevitable. He's back to his old schemes as usual, wanting more power. I liked it when The Torch got all the powers of his teammates and said the Thing's quote, ""It's clobberin' time!"" The next thing would the attraction of Skrulls. Johnny really put a hurting on Doom. And for the Surfer, Susan really got through to him. And he did return the favor to her when Doom downed her.

There are some dexterous moments like the attack at the wedding. (Laurence Fishburne) as the Surfer's voice was more charismatic and deep than the whole performances here. I loved giving the creator (Stan Lee) a cameo as a rejected wedding guest; it could be bitter self-irony as the writer is always deprived of being in the shooting location in Hollywood. It was better than seeing him in idiot cameos in Spider-man movies, where he always stands under a fallen balcony to rescue a kid! The best of it was its brilliant idea to see a matter of exchanging superpowers, and the marvelous sound effects which you wouldn't experience unless in a theater.But, on the downside, the action is lesser, (Jessica Alba) is unbearable as usual, and with yellow hair; she's even mega-unbearable, though she was sensitive enough to serve the uneasiness of her character. Putting in mind that the Silver Surfer can cut off any kind of industrial energy, so how come that all the cars in the street didn't stop while his flying over them after destroying the wedding?! There is a big mistake in terms of the climax, since it's too short, too deficient, and handled by only one person, not the whole team, which weakens what's supposed to be the movie's most important sequence, as well as lessened the total effect of the fun.Now the bigger mistake that poisoned the fun itself was that brief scene where (Chris Evans) is thrown faraway by the Silver Surfer to Egypt, like it's the end of the world already! I feel sick out of watching a lot of movies that deal with Egypt through one constant foolish look; where it is nothing but a primed, a desert, and 2 men with a camel! It's more like seeing America as a Red Indian, and a cowboy who's shooting him in the back! I was in the theater in Cairo, and once this scene took place, we all were in silence, rising eyebrows, then whispering sarcastically something like: Yeah, Hollywood.. it's typical!This is a sequel that didn't outclass its original.

57,freemantle_uk,As bad as the first film,3,26 September 2008,"Whilst I paid to see Fantastic Four, I didn't make the same mistake twice, and only saw this film on a place from Sydney to Singapore. I was warned by a friend of mine that this film was bad, and he was right. I personally think that Fantastic Four is a weaker comic book compared to Marvel's other series like Spider-man, X-Men, Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk and even the Punisher, but it's no excuse for making a bad film.The film starts off with Reed Richards and Sue Storm about to marry each other and it is seen as the biggest wedding of the decade. At the same time there are strange things are happened across the globe. During the wedding a strange silver creature flies through New York and is followed by the Human Touch. After contact with the Silver Surfer the Human Touch has the ability to swap powers with any of the other members of the Fanstatic Four. Reed Richards discovers that a whole line of planets had been destroyed and that it looked like Earth was next. He also discovers that Earth only had a week before it would be destroyed, and the Fanstantic Four end up having to fight with the US Army in London and the Black Forest. Dr. Doom also returns, and he is fascinated by the power of the Silver Surfer. The Fantansic Four end up having to fight the Silver Surfer, the Army and Dr. Doom.Like the first film the casting is awful, Jessica Alba is too young to play Sue Storm and is just there to get naked, Ioan Gruffudd can't act and who though that Julian McMahon should play Dr. Doom should not belong in films. At times it is even worst because the relationship between the Human Touch and the Thing had been toned down, so you lose the comedy value. Dr. Doom is no longer metal and he just a good looking guy in a hood; completely missing the point. There are massive plot holes, such as the Americans having an army base in Russia: I really don't see that happening. The Special Effects were good, but that not a good reason to see a film and there are better actions scenes in films such as in the Spider-man series. I think that Fantanstic Four is not an easy comic book to put on screen. It is hard to make it realistic, but fans of the comic books don't really want to see a kids film. Some aspects should have not have been in the film, like the Fantanstic Four aircraft which was just silly. This film cannot appeal to anyone. The only think that really made me smile was Stan Lee's cameo and the first chase between of the Silver Surfer was well done, but that's it.If you want to watch a good fun comic book film, watch the Spider-man Series, or Iron Man or the Incredible Hulk. Avoid the Fantanstic Four Series. I wouldn't be surprised that a third film is already in the pipeline but I hope if they do it they start again and give it to people who know what they are doing.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
58,ebiros2,Rise of Silver Surfer - but No Galactus ?,5,24 January 2008,"Loosely based on FF issues 48, 49, 50 (Coming of Galactus), and issues 57,58,59, 60 (Doom steals Surfer's powers), this movie while done better than the first one, still misses the mark.It's clear that these guys don't get it about what makes FF one of the best super heroes ever to come out of comics. Unlike Sam Reimy's Spiderman where evidence that Reimy gets what makes Spiderman so cool, or Brian Singer's X-Men where his fleshing out of the characters are so perfect, these guys just have the characters doing cartwheels all the time and never get into the plot or the characters, or the timing of action that makes FF so interesting.The suspense and trauma of coming of Galactus and the Surfer in the original comic is nowhere to be found. I don't think Ioan Gruffudd would have been able to act out the stressed out Reed Richards in trying to devise a way to stop the landing of the Surfer on earth. Coming of the Surfer, his powers, and his eventual capture is so run of the mill Hollywood science fiction plot that, it doesn't have to be a Fantastic Four movie. And no Galactus on this epic episode ? What's the excuse ? Not enough time ? Well TV animation from decades ago was able to pull it off in 30 minutes, and this movie is over 90 minutes. Get rid of the phony capture and Doom stealing the surfer's power plot. That was from another story. Here the same mistake of patch work of just flashy story tidbits from different episodes like they did on the first installment is evident. Too many unnecessary scenes, and not tight enough plot makes this movie ineffective in communicating the power of the characters.

The first ""Fantastic Four"" (2005) received mostly negative reviews but was a box office success, enough of a success that Marvel Comics and Twentieth Century Fox thought it would be possible to channel funds into a sequel. Despite occasional flaws in the script and misjudgments on the part of the filmmakers, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is mostly another successful entry into the superhero movie genre.If you remember from the first film, an accident in outer space bestows a vast array of cosmic powers upon five astronauts:Egghead scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) becomes Mr. Fantastic and is now able to bend any part of his body at will and can give Plastic Man a run for his money.Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) becomes the Invisible Woman, with the ability to turn invisible and generate forcefields. More technically, she can't become completely invisible, but is able to bend light - nonetheless, it becomes difficult to see her (and sometimes she has to strip to get out of sticky situations).Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Sue's hotshot brother, becomes the Human Torch with the ability to engulf his body in flames and can fly.Lastly, poor Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) is transformed into The Thing, an unsightly rock-monster with the strength of at least 100 men and is pretty much indestructible.They put personal squabbles aside to unite as the Fantastic Four (as named by the media), and battled their fifth (and former) teammate and first movie nemesis, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who became Dr. Doom when the accident began to slowly transform him into an angry metal freak with control over electricity. He was defeated, imprisoned in his own metallic body, and sent back to his home country of Latveria in a crate.In this sequel, Reed Richards and Sue Storm are preparing to tie the knot, in a wedding that's all over the tabloids (and brings back memories of any celebrity wedding within the last seven years, say TomKat). Ben's relationship with blind chick Alicia (Kerry Washington) is off without a hitch, and Johnny is still the player with a different girl under his arm at every social function.The Fantastic Four also continue their adventures of saving the world at large and being the greatest heroes on the planet. But that's about to change: a malevolent entity from outer space is causing mayhem and destruction all over the world. Reed theorizes that whatever this thing is, it emits incredible amounts of cosmic radiation and destroys all life on all planets wherever it goes in an eight-day time-span. So the Fantastic Four goes right to work to uncover what this thing is.As you would have it, though, Johnny rushes head-first into the situation and has a face-to-face encounter with the Silver Surfer (played by Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne), who is probably the Marvel Comics equivalent of DC Comics' Superman. The encounter leaves Johnny stunned and a bit of a danger to the rest of the team, since he finds he can now transfer his powers to the others. When it's discovered just how big a threat the Silver Surfer is to Earth, Reed's old adversary General Hager (Andre Braugher) contracts the Four to try to get a handle on the Surfer's movements.Other matters threaten to deteriorate the integrity of the Fantastic Four, however, the biggest being Reed and Sue's desire to get married and finally leave the team and start over with their own family. Needless to say, Johnny and Ben don't take the news lightly. But they'll have to put it all to the side when arch-nemesis Dr. Doom reenters the picture, and they discover they will have to work together to save the world from annihilation by the Silver Surfer. But a series of unexpected events force our heroes to realize that an even bigger threat lies beyond the horizon (G-A-L-A-C-T-U-S), and the Silver Surfer may be our only hope.I should have stated this a little earlier, but I'm not a huge fan of Marvel's first family, but the ""Fantastic Four"" movies, as big as they are, they're highly enjoyable in a very simplistic fashion. They're not too big on intelligence but are very skilled in special effects, production values, and overall entertainment. I don't need to say that the acting is all that good, but the four are oddly fitting, and appealing. There's also no real need to get all mushy and stuff here, but you do feel yourself growing attached to this movie family that is as dysfunctional as any TV family you could think of.For all its faults, a good job was done of establishing the film, with a better-written screenplay by Don Payne and David Frost. Tim Story (returning from his joyful direction of the first film) is again at the helm of another solid and entertaining thrill ride that remains overall faithful to the spirit of its source material. The only major drawback ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" suffers from is that its only newcomer, the titled Silver Surfer, is not very interesting as a movie character. Defined largely by his cosmic powers and Fishburne's out-there creepy voice, little is done to really give him a personality or even make him sympathetic (since he is pretty much a special effect), acting as a herald for a greater evil. But I guess, how many other aliens can almost bring all life on Earth as we know it to an end?9/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
60,robfollower,A little tastier but still far from a gourmet feast.,7,5 March 2019,"The Fantastic Four learn that they aren't the only super-powered beings in the universe when they square off against the powerful Silver Surfer and the planet-eating Galactus.While an improvement on its predecessor, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is nevertheless a juvenile, simplistic picture that has little benefit beyond its special effects.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
61,alindsay-al,A vast improvement on the original but still not to the level of other comic book films,6,18 August 2014,"After watching the garbage that is the first Fantastic Four I have no idea why I watched this film but I must say I was a little bit pleasantly surprised as this film is much better and above average to watch it was decent. This film starts with Reed Richards and Sue Storm attempting to get married when a herald called the Silver Surfer comes to Earth to prepare its destruction. With the help of Victor Von Doom the Fantastic Four attempt to find a way to stop the Silver Surfer and his master the eater of worlds Galactus. Now one of my big gripes with the first film was the performances of Mr Fantastic and The Invisible Woman aka Reed and Sue but I must say they were improved a lot in this film. The guy who plays Reed who's name escapes me takes more charge in this film and starts to become more of a leader that he should be. Jessica Alba once again looks beautiful but her acting really does improve and she does a fine job getting across her feelings well in this film. Now just like the first film I thought Chris Evans did a good job as Johnny Storm and he had great lines with a funny attitude. The Thing was once again done well with some good comedic timing and some great chemistry with Johnny. They also made up for the terrible Dr Doom we got in the first film with a decent Doom in this film McMahon was evil, cunning and his ambitions were clear unlike the first film really. But the best character in my opinion is that of The Silver Surfer himself Laurence Fishburne does a superb job with the voice work as he sounds chilling and evil when he needs to be and sympathetic when he needs to be. The Surfer is one of the best things in this movie in every way I just wish we could have got a little more of him. The story like the first one isn't a strong one, it is so cliché with its narrative and doesn't really add anything to the plot that would be surprising to anybody. I must say the script was better then the first with some witty humour and heartfelt moments, plus the Surfers great lines. But some of it does fall flat and some of the dialogue we could have just done without. The style of the film was good The Surfer looked great, Doom looked great and the Fantastic Four looked great plus the locations were great. But I only give this a good mark not great because as a fan of the character of Galactus I was massively disappointed what they did with him and I am sure others are too. So overall this is an improvement but it isn't a film you need to rush out and see. It'll be decent but nothing like Iron Man or Thor levels of quality.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
62,MaxBorg89,"Better than the first one, but little else than simple summer entertainment",7,20 August 2007,"Given the first Fantastic Four's box-office success (despite a storm of negative reviews), a sequel was almost mandatory. And with a trailer that promised lots of action and, most of all, the screen debut of fan-favorite Silver Surfer, one may be forgiven for expecting the second installment to be much better than its predecessor. The truth? 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is nowhere near the levels of Spider-Man, X-Men or even Hulk, but it does slightly improve on the original, the result being a passable, rather entertaining summer actioner.At first, though, it seems like we're slipping back into the first film's mediocrity: after a pretty good opening sequence (showing Galactus, here depicted differently than in the comics, as he destroys a planet), the movie cuts to Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm's (Jessica Alba) wedding arrangements, during which the FF's leader throws out some gibberish about their imminent union being more important than sub-molecular problems (huh?). His fiancée's reaction? ""That's the most romantic thing you have ever said to me!"".Thankfully, that dull moment is immediately forgotten, as we move on to the actual wedding ceremony (featuring one of Stan Lee's best cameos: he plays a rejected guest, in reference to a similar scene in the original comic-book issue), which is abruptly interrupted by a mysterious force that is causing climactic changes all around the world (cue an amusing joke about global warming). This force, it turns out, is actually the Surfer (physically portrayed by Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne), a herald who looks for planets the aforementioned Galactus can feed on. His presence implies that the Four have got only one week to come up with a solution to Earth's problems, and on top of that they have to deal with the return of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who was revived by the Surfer's actions.In terms of plotting, this film has a more interesting script than the first installment: having introduced the characters in the previous movie, Don Payne and Mark Frost can focus on defining them a little better (something that was missing last time) in order to properly integrate their different personalities into the story. Largely, they succeed: the best characters are still the Human Torch (Chris Evans, cocky, self-absorbed and funny) and the Thing (Michael Chiklis, ranging between amusing and eager to fight), but Reed and Sue get a better treatment as well, emerging as three-dimensional people instead of underwritten type. Gruffudd, in particular, is more comfortable in his role, as proved by a hilarious disco scene, one of the best examples of how the film manages to replicate the comic's mix of humor and light action (this is a PG feature after all).Speaking of which, another improvement concerns the action scenes: they may not match the visual inventiveness of other Marvel adaptations, but thanks to the Silver Surfer's presence they are charged with an energy that was unseen in the first movie (the Torch-Surfer duel is even better in the actual film than it was in the trailer). The Surfer himself is also a charismatic addition, although the short running time (92 minutes), combined with the fact that it takes half an hour before he shows up, makes the exploration of his tragic nature a little rushed. Of course, it doesn't help that a lot of time is spent, or rather wasted, on Dr. Doom: McMahon may look more menacing than before (especially at the beginning of the film), but once again he prefers to sideline his own lethal charm and mimic previous Marvel villains (the Green Goblin in the first movie, Magneto in the sequel), reducing a respected and feared character to a half-hearted pantomime; in addition, the bad-guy-becoming-ally gimmick has been used before and much better, namely by Bryan Singer in the superb X2. Another disappointment is Galactus: that he doesn't exactly look like his comic-book counterpart was to be expected; that he doesn't speak once and is used very sparely (little more than five minutes in the entire movie) considerably diminishes the impact of his presence, making the Surfer the only element able to save the film.Saving a motion picture, however, turns out to be a lot more difficult than saving the world, at least in this case, meaning that, though enjoyable, 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a fairly average summer movie. Which is all right compared to the original FF movie, but not considering the higher quality of other blockbusters out there.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
63,jimbo-53-186511,Less interesting than its predecessor with a story that isn't explored or developed particularly well,4,16 January 2016,"In some ways The Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer got off to a rather bad start when I realised that it opened up with arguably the two dullest members of the Fantastic Four getting married. I wish I could say that I was wrong and that I was being unnecessarily harsh, but sadly this second film in the franchise never really worked for me;After I watch a film I'll usually look at its rating and see what the critics thought of the film that I've watched and I must admit to being somewhat surprised that the critics generally gave this film 'positive' feedback and many said that it was more fun and less boring than the first film. Well maybe I watched a different film because I actually thought it was more boring, less fun and less interesting than the first film...Starting the film with the approaching wedding of arguably the two dullest characters in the franchise didn't give the film the best of starts as far as I was concerned, but to then drag this aspect out for about a third of the running time meant that the film started to get on my wick. Even when the film does get going it never really caught my interest mainly because I felt that the story wasn't explored or developed properly - little is really learnt about the Silver Surfer or his cause (other than helping some other worldly being to destroy planets across the universe). The writers never really attempt to explain a lot of what is happening in this film which wouldn't be as much of a problem if the film had a sense of fun to distract from the poor storytelling, but because it doesn't the weak story stands out all the more. I also thought that the idea of The Fantastic Four temporarily switching powers could potentially have been interesting, but here it seemed to be played more for laughs and ultimately went nowhere and had little impact on the story. The only thing that I actually liked about this film was Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans as The Thing and The Human Torch respectively. Their camaraderie did give the film some lift and both Chiklis and Evans were every bit as good as they were in the first film. It's a shame really that many other plot elements are so weak.I'm somewhat surprised that this film has a similar rating to the first film as to me there are pretty much worlds apart in terms of quality. Whereas the first film offered the viewer an interesting exploration of normal people getting superpowers following exposure to radiation coupled with heart, amusing banter and a fairly well developed villain. The sequel offers a poorly developed and uninteresting story, a dull antagonist that offers no real menace, a silly use of superpowers and to top it all off it also offers one of the weakest ending to a film that I've ever seen. Those looking for silly special effects will be well-catered for me, but if you're like me and value content over style then this sequel is one I suggest you avoid.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

For me it was just the right mix of action, humor (naughty at that), and drama (not too much Spiderman-like angst), rolled into one fine exciting package. All four heroes had their moments to shine action-wise and character-wise.As in the first film, Chris Evans stole his scenes, both as Johnny Storm and as The Human Torch. This time, there was even some dramatic character development for that character. They just had to include one gratuitous scene of Johnny clad in only a towel for his female fans.I don't know why, but Jessica Alba still did not look like the correct choice for Invisible Woman. I also don't know why her hair style looks very fake in a lot of scene, particularly the one set in a Japanese garden, where it was truly fixed up horrendously.The Silver Surfer was truly a star in this film. His cool appearance and action sequences are great to watch. I was surprised to note in the credits that the voice was given by Lawrence Fishburne.

66,aharmas,This film is Fantastic!!!,10,17 June 2007,"When the first film was over, I was disappointed because I wanted MORE!, feeling cheated that this cool quartet of super heroes had done their job, and the credits rolled... kind like ""The Sopranos"", without the hype. Here is the sequel, and this film rocks! Mr. Fantastic and the troupe are back, with their powers, their very distinct personalities, and plenty of charm, ready to save the world, showing how a team works, like a true family.Best part of the movie is everything, from its impeccable special effects, demonstrating how special effect technology keeps improving, and how a simple story, when well developed and acted can produce chills down people's spines. While I'm seating in the audience, the children were reactions varied from: ""that was bad"" to ""awesome, awesome, awesome..."", and the best tribute to any of these films, ""that wasn't boring at all, much better than...."" The film moves quickly and in a very dynamic manner, giving us enough to understand its plot, giving us more insights into each of the characters' background and personalities, not overburdening anyone with unnecessary pathos and too much drama. Although the dying scene did bring a couple of tears to my eyes.""Fantastic Four"" works because it respects its audience and doesn't pander to us, giving us something that might look impressive in a treatment, but it's poorly executed. The cast is first rate, and it shows, and now on to the introduction of a new classic character: The Silver Surfer. This dude is blazing hot, as played by Doug Jones and rendered by the top notch CGI team behind the film. It's not just a showcase for the amount of money spent on the film, but a valid, powerful, and interesting new addition to the world of action/SFX cinema. Here's an ambiguous figure that gives something to fear and wonder, a power that used properly can be the best that could ever happen to humans; otherwise it's a valid fear.Dr. Doom is back, with his insidious nature, ready to outsmart our heroes and gives us a little trouble.

Galactus sends ahead his creation, the Silver Surfer, to get things rolling, only to run afoul of the FF4. The special effects are solid, but characterization is weak -- something the Spider-Man movies excel at. Plus Jessica Alba remains a poor choice to play Sue Storm. She just doesn't have the acting chops, and the bleached hair, or wig, is awful. The Silver Surfer is all CGI and really isn't given much to do.

It's missing even the goofy charm that made first Fantastic Four a decent popcorn movie. The problems begin with the casting. Its much more apparent here than in the first movie, that these actors really don't fit their characters. As much as I love Jessica Alba, she's no Sue Storm. She tries hard, but she never comes close to being anything more than a pretty distraction. Dr. Doom is smarmy, but not sinister or intimidating. Johnny seems bland, The Thing is defined by his girlfriend more than anything else, and Reed is just goofy. Each character is basically an even more watered down version of themselves from the first movie. The Silver Surfer just flies around looking cool and making dire predictions. And let's not even begin talking about Galactus. Everyone is uniformly underwhelming. As for the story, it's more boring than anything involving FREAKIN' GALACTUS should ever be. It's short, which makes it bearable...until the ridiculous ending. Horrible. It sounds like I hated the movie, but I was just genuinely disappointed that Rise of the Silver Surfer didn't improve on the first movie, at all.

72,brando647,The Silver Surfer's First Film Appearance Deserved Better Treatment,6,16 January 2010,"I don't know what it is about this movie that keeps me watching it every few months. It almost as if I need to watch it on occasion to remind myself how mediocre it is. It was hard to believe that a Marvel film utilizing one of the most interesting characters from the comic universe, Galactus, could be so bland. I suppose one of the reasons I keep returning to this film is that I want so badly to see the Fantastic Four franchise survive. I know it has potential; I love the characters, it has an interesting collection of villains to select from, and the comic series provides some great stories as starting material. It just isn't happening, thanks to poor writing and a little too much creative license at the hands of director Tim Story and writers Don Payne and Mark Frost.The second installment in the F4 franchise suffers from the some of the same problems as the first film, while adding some new issues on top. The story potential is high: Reed Richards and Susan Storm's wedding is postponed (again) when the Earth receives a visit from the Silver Surfer, herald of Galactus. Further complications arise when Victor von Doom returns with plans of his own. Just writing that synopsis made me want to watch the film again; it sounds like the foundation for a great F4 film. My issues began with the fact that we wasted the first 30 minutes of the film preparing for Reed and Sue's wedding instead of getting to the meat of the Silver Surfer plot. Then, once the plot kicks into gear, we're rushed through the next hour to a deus ex machina ending that fails to satisfy (and may even aggravate some of the comic series' fans). When the film was over, I felt as if the Surfer was never given the opportunity to reach his full on-screen potential and I've been left hoping he's given another shot.Just as in the first film, this movie is plagued with some cringe-worthy one-liners (once again, Doom is given some of the worst). I know the F4 was a bit goofier than some of the other Marvel properties but the filmmakers need to tone it down a bit. Though, I can deal with corny dialogue; what I can't abide is blatant slap-in-the-face product placement. I loved that the filmmakers were able to work the Fantasticar into the script (especially since I'd considered it a bit too cartoonish to work in a film) but the shout-out for Dodge when Johnny first sees it and excitedly exclaims ""A hemi!"" went a bit too far.All of the original cast from the first film return, which is both good and bad. Just as before, Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis are perfect choices for their characters and do a (no pun intended) fantastic job bringing their characters to life. Also, just as in the first film, I was unimpressed with the performances of Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon. Alba is a beautiful woman and fits the image of Susan Storm, but I've never felt her to be too talented an actress and she remains the weak point of the series. McMahon, again, does not feel right in the role of Dr. Doom; he has a hard time doing insidiously evil without coming across as a hammed performance and I just can't take him seriously. These are not traits I want in the man given the role as one of the best Marvel villains.For what time we're given with him, the Surfer is the most impressive aspect of this film. The visual effects team did a great job with creating the iconic character and Laurence Fishburne was an inspired casting choice for his voice. Galactus, unfortunately, does not receive the same treatment and we are never given a real glimpse at the demigod through his surrounding cloud. In my opinion, it was a waste but the director Tim Story clarified in the film's supplemental material that he chose to keep Galactus vague so that future filmmakers could do him justice. After two average films, now we need to hope someone is even given the chance.Honestly, this film will only appeal to fans of the series and, even then, don't expect to be wow'd. The second F4 film isn't a bad movie, but it never rises above mediocre. The impressive special effects and production design fall victim to plot holes, poor writing, and under-use of the film's assets. It's a quick, mildly entertaining means of spending 90 minutes but, if you're anything like me, you'll walk away from this film wondering what could have been if the epic introduction of the Silver Surfer and Galactus had been put in better hands.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

The problem is that this movie switches from drama to comedy in scenes. If you want it to be funny, go with it and vice versa.Although with the PG rating, there is even more intense action sequences and a death scene that pushes the PG rating a bit. The CGI in here ranges from being bad to fantastic with some things you can feast your eyes on.

Yes, many will be disappointed on how he appears in the movie or that he appears at all but isn't this film called ""Rise of the Silver Surfer""? So please, don't be surprised of how Galactus appears.Although not as good as Spider-Man 3, this film is harmless fun for the family. There are more action sequences and comedy.

In an age where just about every single other Superhero film has to be dark, gritty and practically psychologically scarring (including the recently released ""Man of Steel"" where Superman of all people has a vision of being drowned in skulls), I just appreciate that 20th Century Fox and director Tim Story were content with giving us a fun, fluffy set of films to enjoy. It's almost admirable that a studio could look at a comic book and say ""Hey, let's make a film out of this that the whole family could enjoy!""And I do have to say, while not a particularly strong film, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (no, it's not called ""4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"", to the people who insist it is), is actually one of my favorite ""dumb fun"" movies, and I think it is a much better film than the first. (Although I will admit the first is a definite guilty- pleasure for me) It's a film I can pop in after a rough day and know that within 15 minutes, I'll be chuckling and having fun for it's relatively short running length.The story begins with the titular Silver Surfer (an alien entity that resembles a human, only with metallic, silver-like skin, who rides on a surf-board like vehicle) arriving on Earth, causing various climactic and weather phenomena. At the same time, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) are preparing for their big wedding day, amongst a media circus, as the ""Fantastic Four"" have become huge celebrities during the films. However, after a disastrous (and pretty exciting) action sequence, the Four (also including ""Ben Grimm/Thing"" as portrayed by Michael Chiklis and ""Johnny Storm/Human Torch"" as portrayed by Chris Evans) are forced to abandon the wedding in order to learn more about the Silver Surfer and what dark forces he may be an omen to, as well as contend with the return of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who they are forced into an uneasy alliance with.I think the cast works a lot better here. As was the case in the first film, Gruffudd and Chiklis are the strongest performers, but I feel that Alba and Evans do a good job as well, and play their characters more naturally and evenly this time around. And it makes the chemistry of the characters all the better. McMahon is also good once again as Von Doom. And the two new actors portraying the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones as the physical body performer and Laurence Fishburne as the voice) do a wonderful job bringing the iconic character to life. Supporting roles by the likes of Andre Braugher and Kerry Washington are also well-played and a lot of fun on-screen.I think the script this time around is what makes this a better film. The first film's script had a lot of issues. It meandered and was too overlong for the sort of story it was trying to tell. It made the clichés and some of the flatter jokes stand out more. Here, we have a much better pacing, less meandering with the shorter length and the characters are showcased a lot better. It also doesn't hurt that some of the subplots this time around are actually a ton of fun, and easier to relate to than in the first film. And it has a better balance of action-to-story, which was a big issue with the first film. (In that the first film barely had any action, whereas here, there's a pretty decent amount)Director Tim Story is also a bit more in his element this time around. Part of my issue with the direction in the first film is that it felt a little plain. I think in part because it was Story's first big action film. Now that he's had experience, the action is a lot better, and feels more exciting and organic. It's genuinely a lot more fun this time around. He also seems to have learned some lessons by the mistakes of the first film.Asides from that, I think the rest of the production is quite nice. The effects are generally good. The set and costume design is great. And John Ottman's score is a lot of fun.I honestly do consider this to be a good, fun film. And I think it is tragically, criminally under-recognized and underrated. I was actually sort-of sad when it was announced that Fox had plans to reboot the series, because after this film, I wanted to see a third entry in the series. I wanted to see more work from this cast. And it's a shame that we won't have that chance now, because I think a third film could have potentially even been better.But as it stands, the two ""Fantastic Four"" movies are a lot of fun. And I would recommend both of them (this one in particular as it is the better of the two) to anyone seeking a good, silly, fun time with a good, silly, fun film.I give ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

77,sme_no_densetsu,Fairly entertaining superhero fluff,6,21 May 2008,"I was one of those who thought that the first Fantastic Four movie wasn't as bad as everyone else seemed to think. This time around, though, I have to agree with the general consensus. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a passable superhero movie but certainly nothing special in any way.All of the main characters are back from the previous film. In my opinion Ioan Gruffudd gives the best performance but this is hardly a film to be watched for acting. Jessica Alba is pretty awful but she's only there as eye candy, of course. Funny how so many female scientists in Hollywood films are drop dead gorgeous. But I digress...The direction doesn't bear remarking upon but the special effects do not disappoint. Then again, the special effects are little help when the story isn't that interesting. It's standard 'save the world' superhero stuff with a predictable outcome. The internal struggles within the group aren't as intriguing as the last time around either.If you must, see this one with low expectations.

And it all came to a catastrophic blaze with Trank's 2015 reboot. But Rise of the Silver Surfer showed that the life left in this potential franchise was non-existent. I hate these Fantastic Four movies. They're devoid of the things that make for good superhero movies. The X-Men movies were so tastefully done, so why couldn't Fantastic Four have the same effort done for it? Fantastic Four: great team in comics, HORRIBLE in cinema. At least that is until Disney/Marvel get the film rights back for it.

80,dunmore_ego,More *Four* Bore,5,30 April 2008,"There's something about the Fantastic Four that's not all that fantastic: it's called acting.Listened to Joe Satriani's Surfing with the Alien before spanking this review  'twas the only way I was gonna charge the cells after watching the soporific, yet tenuously linked Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. As some of you 80s steel-belted wardogs know, Surfing was Satriani's 1987 horse-powered second album and kick in the nuts to the gods of guitar, featuring none other than Marvel Comic's Silver Surfer on its cover.In Rise, the principle cast returns from Fantastic Four (2005), and promptly continues doing what they did in the previous film: not act - Ioan Gruffud (stretching a premise as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards), Jessica Alba (out-acted by her bra again as Invisible Girl/Sue Storm), Chris Evans (flamed by his CGI alter-ego, Human Torch/Johnny Storm) and Michael Chiklis (supposedly a rock, but indiscernible from wood, as Thing/Ben Grimm).Like the title track on Satriani's album, director Tim Story's Rise is a blistering juggernaut, a sliding, gliding tour de force of kineticism, with the Silver Surfer himself the coolest saboteur provocateur this side of Darth Vader (Doug Jones embodying Surfer's glittering form and Larry Fishburne dropping his Morpheus on Silvie's vocals); an interplanetary herald of destruction sent by Galactus, the consumer of worldsThe set pieces (the Thames emptying near the London Eye, the Surfer's chase sequences, cosmic clouds clawing their way around Earth) are massive spectacles which keep the 12-year-old contingent happy, but writers Don Payne, Mark Frost and John Turman, though trying hard to put emotional 'nads on the script, are subsumed by the summer stupidity of the director.The ice-veined Surfer's dark origins and darker purpose are given short shrift (he's from a planet which will be consumed by an entity insane with lustful power, were it not for his promise to seek out other planets for that entity, Galactus, to eat); what could have been epic and disturbing is handled with gloved thumbs by director Story and egregious so-called performances by egregious so-called actors.The Surfer himself, though, stands above and beyond any puerile human morality or notion of thespianism  in every sense, he's UNREAL! With all that queuing for the first iPhones, seems Reed Richards had one before anyone, as it constantly rings at his paparazzi-laden nuptials, alerts him to radiation levels, breaks up his wedding, connects to the internet AND does half his acting for him; while his bride-to-be, Sue Storm, assumes her dream-killing role and starts bitching about ""leading a normal life"" and eschewing their tight-suited superhero roles before Reed has even had time to wipe the bachelor party stripper lipstick off his tool. And Reed's just the type of puss to give in to her, but this subplot is quickly forgotten when the Silver Surfer rides by with no clothes on and everything starts getting pear shaped.The army deploy the Four to capture the Surfer and Reed gets his intelligentsia on when he retorts to General Hager (Andre Braugher) that even though he was raised as a geek and not a quarterback, he's still rich, famous and marrying ""the hottest woman on Earth,"" whereupon Jessica Alba's dumb head grows larger than the Thing's thing. Chalk up one for the nerd patrol, but did he have to be such a nerd about it? The Four are forced to ally with Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon), their nemesis from the first movie, who has come back to life because in movies you can do that. Doom's ulterior agenda is to channel the Surfer's power, which he progresses in full view of everyone without them being the wiser - because in movies you can do that.Earth is next on the menu for Galactus, who has employed the Surfer to drill holes in the Earth almost as big as Jessica Alba's head, to presumably poke his cosmic fingers into them like a bowling ball and pop us into his mouth like finger food. The Four knock the Surfer off his board (which supplied his limitless power) by using Reed's waffle maker, whereupon the Army immediately tie Silvie to a table and torture him for no reason - you know, standard American Military Procedure.And while Doom makes off with the Surfer's board, fanboys hold candlelight vigils for the death of authenticity  in Surfer canon, the board had nothing to do with his power. Another track on Surfing With The Alien was Always With Me, Always With You, where Satriani (one of the most lethal gunslingers of the modern age - after Hendrix, and Eddie and - no time to dispute the merits of axe-worship) displays the flip side to bombast and bluster  subtlety and taste, something which Rise lacks as much as acting.While Doom surfs around on his commandeered board, firing ""bzzz"" things from his hands (because we've got this special effects budget  we might as well use it) and the Four chase him in a flying bathtub, Galactus envelops Earth (represented by a cosmic cloud  see Movie Convention Number Twelve-a). And the Silver Surfer is the only naked shiny thing who can save the day.The Four's teamwork reclaims the board, whereupon Sue Storm dies and the Surfer Tampers In God's Domain to bring her back to life  because in movies you but you get the picture by now, right?...Surfer dude goes totally tubular surfing directly into Galactus' cloudy interior and  I dunno, farting or something, which makes Galactus explode in a shockwave that should have thrown Earth out of orbit, but instead just damaged Japan a little, which was fortunately covered by its Godzilla insurance. Guess you hold the power of a god when you're Surfing With The Alien. Just ask Joe Satriani",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
81,pyrocitor,Superhero escapism at its most simplified and unashamedly enjoyable,6,11 December 2008,"From the very onset of its being announced, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer stood out as one of the least expected sequels of the year. After the lackluster box office and critical reviews of the first adaptation of the classic Marvel comics team, it seemed unlikely that any further mileage would be attempted to be extracted from the source material. However, Twentieth Century Fox saw differently, and a sequel was triumphantly declared, begging the question as to whether the franchise would follow the recently conventional superhero route of going darker and more complex. In the end, such concerns couldn't be farther away from the intent of the project, as Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer proves just as deliriously determined as its predecessor to entertain, even at the sake of complexity, its exploration of the coming of the Silver Surfer, one of the most fascinating in the comic's history being processed as superhero escapism at its most simplified and unashamedly enjoyable.The story begins immersed in expositional drama, with the pending media circus of a wedding between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman leaving the couple debating abandoning superheroism in favour of a normal married life. However, despite the intriguing subtextual examination of the cultural role of the superhero in a media obsessed society, the madcap pre-wedding antics may be cute but are often oversimplified or overstated, the occasional profound kernel lost amidst borderline excessive silliness (Mr. Fantastic ""loosening up"" at his bachelor party is fun, but a bit much). As such, it is almost a relief when the future of the world is threatened, and the real fun begins. The expanded scale of the conflict (saving Earth from destruction by intergalactic force Galactus and his herald the Silver Surfer) allows the special effects team to up the ante on flexing their big budget muscles, between exhilarating cosmically powered showdowns to more subtle touches (Mr. Fantastic's stretching ability looks far less artificial this time). John Ottman's triumphant musical score completes the heroic package, exemplifying the 'generic but undeniably fun' tone of the film. Returning director Tim Story's continual desire to keep the mood light and fun may hamper the story's potential for actual gravitas regarding the pending end of the world, but the breezy exhilaration of the film is sufficient to prevent the viewer from devoting enough attention to the ludicrous situation, content to earnestly wow and cheer rather than fret matters such as realism, coherence or the vain attempts to make Jessica Alba appear blonde and blue-eyed. Story's penchant for nodding to fans of the comics also makes the film substantially more entertaining, with inclusions such as the Fantasticar proving rousing and exhilarating, and even his revamping of the ominous Galactus proving surprisingly satisfying. In an era of superhero films attempting to continually one-up each other on the 'dark and brooding' front, it is surprisingly refreshing to see a comic book adaptation with no more grandiose goals than to entertain, sporting such an unpretentious sense of fun that one can't help but go along for the ride in despite the numerous stumbles.Once again, Ioan Gruffudd impresses as emotionally distant yet quirkily noble heroic scientist Mr. Fantastic, perfectly essaying the occasional comedic or dramatic moment which emerge from his aptly maintained front of stern focus. Unfortunately, Jessica Alba disappointingly delivers a far less inspired performance than even her usual standard as the harried Invisible Woman. Alba's flat, painfully unemotional performance is uncomfortably punctuated by her grotesque excesses in makeup, giving her the appearance of a bizarre doll rather than human being. Conversely, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis as the impish Human Torch and gruffly wisecracking rock-encrusted Thing prove the casting highlights, their comedic banter and irreverently charismatic performances providing the film with much needed emotional heart and comic relief. However, returning antagonist Julian McMahon as Machiavellian Doctor Doom feels like a hasty last minute addition, his sparsity of screen time giving McMahon little chance to exude sufficient villainous menace or even appear to have much point as a character. In contrast, Kerry Washington is delightfully charming as the Thing's blind girlfriend Alicia, and Andre Braugher delivers a reliably disapproving performance as a gruff military general. Finally, the masterful motion capture movement of Doug Jones and melodious, otherworldly voice of Lawrence Fishburne combine perfectly to capture the mystery and pathos of the dynamic Silver Surfer, instilling real heart into a potentially overly artificial character. To call Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer mindless entertainment would hardly be a substantial overstatement, as the film's primary concern of delivering light-hearted fun often comes at the expense of character development and credible emotional engagement with the story. However, mindless entertainment need not be seen as strictly a negative, and those willing to take the film for what it is, a piece of not overly challenging, fun and occasionally exhilarating superpowered escapism, may well find the film a rousing success - just don't expect to remember much of it days down the road. -6/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
82,chrichtonsworld,Quite better than the original,6,3 July 2007,"This sequel is more exciting than the first Fantastic Four movie. The ff now really work as a team like in the comics. The introduction of one of the coolest character in the marvel universe is definitely one of the reasons to watch this movie. Even when this movie has a runtime of 92 minutes the movie can be dull at times. But when the action kicks in it is very enjoyable. I do have my doubts on Victor Von Doom. He doesn't come near the character he supposed to be in the comics. (Why did he wear the iron mask,in the movie he isn't scarred at all! That was the reason why he put the mask on in the comics.) I did get the feeling that ""The thing"" was under used in this movie. He is my most favorite character of the four. And why didn't they show the true form of ""Galactus"" Well i can go on and mention all the flaws and be negative. But to be honest ""The rise of the Silver Surfer)with all it's flaws does has caught the spirit of what makes Fantastic Four so special.

83,Sirus_the_Virus,Better than the original.,7,10 October 2009,"Fantastic four:Rise of the silver surfer is even better than the original. The original film flopped. Not at the box office but with critics. Me, I gave it a recommendation though it wasn't the best. Now we have Rise of the Silver Surfer. A rare better sequel that makes up for disappointed people. I wasn't disappointed but I though that it was flawed.In the sequel, Reed Richards(Ion Griffudd) and Sue Storm(Jessica Alba)are due to get married. They have tried so many times. When they are finally going to do it, The Silver Surfer arrives, and wreaks havoc. Apparently, when the Silver Surfer goes to a planet, eight days later, the planet dies. So The Fantastic four have to stop him. This film isn't as good as Spider-man 3, but is sure better than Ghost Rider, which is also flawed.Everyone took a pass on this film too. People, these movies aren't even that bad. I went and saw both of them and liked them. But the problem I had with both of them is that they are both kind of cheesy. I found the sequel to Fantastic four far more interesting. In a lot of films, I like the villain more than the hero. The villains are usually far cooler. They are in this too.

84,Angelus2,"""Flame on!!""",8,22 February 2008,"This is slightly better then the first.Doctor Doom returns to help the Fantastic Four in dealing with a new menace named Silver Surfer (who is a hero in the comics) The film is good but not great like many critic have said. It does deliver but the plot is a little one dimensional, the sub-plots are not very entertaining. But the Johnny and Thing's scenes are an upside.Fantastic Four are not the most amazing characters of the Marvel world and so they suffer in terms of villains and plot. What critics forget is that this is a superhero movie.The actors do try a little harder to give the characters a little more depth, but Julian Mcmahon is the diamond in the bunch; he oozes evil; while the special effects keep getting better; the final fight is a good scene. And the end is predictable, Dr.Doom's costume is definitely a plus, the Silver Surfer could have been used on another franchise, quite possibly his own, being an entity beyond the reaches of superheroes.The cloud representing Galactus was pretty impressive and clever, I was expecting a gigantic man who sits on a massive chair.Overall....just another good superhero movie.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
85,mstomaso,"Much Better than the Debut, but the Surfer is a Bit Watered-Down",7,29 April 2008,"The second installment in the Fantastic Four franchise is a more plot-driven reader's digest version of the classic Jack Kirby/ Stan Lee story of the Silver Surfer and Galactus. Those who do not already know what was left out of the screen adaptation will probably not feel the full depth and power of the original work - the Surfer's constant anguish, his loss of identity, the labyrinthine philosophical dialogue and the profound power of Galactus, and the hopelessness of our heroes' situation. Nevertheless, 4: The Rise of the Silver Surfer manages to connect the dots surprisingly well, and distills this great tale to its essence.An astronomical phenomenon has come to earth, bringing with it environmental disasters and warnings of worse to come. The phenomenon is the embodiment of the power cosmic - a being infused with the ability to convert matter and energy at will. What does he want, and how long is the earth to survive? Meanwhile, back at Fantastic Four HQ, Reed and Sue are planning a wedding, and Ben and Johnny are beginning to settle into their characters. As the earth crumbles around them, the couple that binds our team of heroes are considering leaving heroism behind once and for all. But Reed's mind can not be contained, and when Victor Von Doom surfaces with new knowledge about the surfer, his competitive instincts and sense of danger are uncontrollably agitated.I have long held the opinion that the saga of the Silver Surfer could not be made into a successful movie. Thankfully, this film does not attempt to tell the whole story, but only skims the surface of the surfer and Galactus' introduction. Jack Kirby's amazing artwork could never translate properly into the cinematic medium, and - again thankfully - the art directors and screenwriters involved in this film completely re-envisioned and reinvented Galactus, but left the surfer largely intact. In my opinion, this film did what it set out to do as well as it could be done.The cast seemed both more challenged by and more comfortable in their roles in The Rise of the Silver Surfer. The script, editing and directing were all noticeably better than the introductory film, and the special effects were appropriately fantastic.Recommended for fans, but not recommended for purists. As always, comic book fans should not let their expectations run away with them. Film is a different medium, and sometimes requires a radically different story.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
86,sarastro7,A cosmic letdown,3,15 June 2007,"As a comics reader who knows the source material, FF2 left me with a great deal of reservations. The ending in particular disappointed me. The new superhero movies always let us down when it comes to the cosmic part of the original stories.Let me be clear: I am not a purist. I don't demand that the movies should be slavishly faithful to the comics. It's fine by me that they change the story, as long as what they put in there instead is just as good. And this, of course, is the problem. In the X-Men movies, we never see the alien Shi'ar, even though that's where the X-Men got their super-science. In Spider-Man 3, we never saw the planet from the Secret Wars storyline, where the alien symbiont, Venom, came from. And now, in FF2, we don't get the huge back-story of Galactus. We don't even get Galactus as a defined character. In the movie he's just some sissy-ass cloud monster who, ridiculously, can be destroyed by his own servant, the infinitely less powerful Silver Surfer. No way. Does not compute.Galactus, in the comics, is a force of nature. He can be stopped, and sometimes even reasoned with, but he can't be destroyed. His fate is tied in with the fate of the universe. If you like the science fiction part of superhero comics, the ridiculously diluted ""Galactus"" of this movie is a massive, massive letdown.And unfortunately, there were a great deal of other problems with the climax of FF2, especially this:The power swapping. That kind of thing does not happen in the comics without a whole lot of proper explanation. Here: none. AND, after seeing that whoever the Torch touches will swap powers with him, how does it follow that he can just absorb all the powers of the other three, who are then powerless? It doesn't. But they just casually know that that's what will happen, and casually go ahead with it, making the fight and climax equally casual.The Surfer's allegiance. When exactly does he switch? Surely not before he sees Susan die (another stupid element - the comics Surfer does not go around resurrecting the dead). And yet, Reed and the others plan for him to stop Galactus even before Susan dies. Doesn't make sense.And that was just the climax. We also have other problems: Why is Doom even in the movie? They tried to conflate several of the greatest FF stories of all time, but stuffing these plots into this storyline just makes it half-assed. There's none of the original impact here.Another thing I wasn't too fond of was the comedy. It's okay to have a few funny scenes, but in this movie they just went on and on playing the powers for laughs. It detracts from the seriousness of the story; ESPECIALLY a Galactus story, for cripes' sakes! So, I have to say this movie was a big disappointment to me. I really liked the first one. I rated it an 8. This one only rates a 3. Considering my great expectations, this comes as nothing less than a cosmic letdown.And to all those who claim that this sequel is better than the first one: Shyeah. What do you know.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
87,mentalcritic,More like the Barely Adequate Four...,2,28 October 2007,"Thirty years ago, when Star Wars was just being released to theatres and Superman was in production, this film might have been impressive. Twenty years ago, a little before Tim Burton slapped a lot of expectations upside the head and redefined the way comic book adaptations are filmed forever, ROTSS as I will call it henceforth might have been mildly impressive. But the thing about storytelling is that once your audience has seen or heard a good story told in an impressive fashion, the bar is instantly raised. Ten years ago, in the wake of the stink that was Batman Forever, this half-baked offal might have seemed passable. But after the incredible statements on how far we have not come since 1945 that the real X-Men films turned out to be, ROTSS is woefully inadequate. As I stated in my comments about the previous Fantastic Four film, ROTSS is more a case of X-Men Dumbed Down For Infants, and the fact that director Tim Story was not fired after his appalling effort on the first film demonstrates that not everyone at Fox has their act together.One of the most commonly-cited complaints about the original Fantastic Four film was that the characters seem largely indifferent to their newfound powers and their situations. This was because, with the sole exception of Michael Chiklis, the actors are never given any time to explore their characters, their characters' emotions, or their characters' situations. We ended up knowing less about the Four than we do most characters in a soap opera, and as a result, they seem less real. Even in Dark Angel, arguably a top ten contender for the worst-written dialogue ever heard on television, we had more reason to care about the support characters there than we do the titular heroes in ROTSS. And that is the one big problem which ROTSS just cannot recover from. Because these so-called heroes live like celebrities and are treated like rock stars, we end up with no reason to care what happens to them. In one memorable (for all the wrong reasons) scene, as Reed is using his flexibility to impress women in a nightclub, we cannot help being reminded of Rogue's abject fear of even touching someone.In the original Fantastic Four, this effect was bad enough on its own. Its poor time economy and seeming inability to properly develop the characters left this sequel with little or no foundation to balance itself upon. Where X-Men 2 had the inevitable attack of the Normalness Patrol upon its heroes and its anticipation, the biggest event in ROTSS when going in is the wedding of two characters. Since the two characters have about as much character as the leads in an episode of Neighbours, we are not just indifferent to this event. We literally just flat out do not give a crap. And considering that ROTSS has to make do with a mere ninety-two minutes of running time, you cannot count on any story development to give you an investment in what happens to the characters, either. When Victor Von Doom steals the silver surfboard for his own purposes, one ends up being too aware of how little time remains in the film's running length to really get worked up about the possibility of anything exciting.Not helping anything is the mostly-droll acting. Jessica Alba looks more comfortable here whining about the inevitable challenges of her nuptials than she does convincing us that she regards the safety of our world as her responsibility. Ioan Gruffudd and Chris Evans are just there, and just basically adequate. Even Michael Chiklis is ultimately reduced in this sequel due to his character being given all of the perks of fame without a single drawback being given the slightest exploration. Julian McMahon could not play Victor Von Doom on the most maudlin day of his life, and in this film his credibility as a genuine threat is almost as sorely missed as that of the Silver Surfer. Speaking of the Silver Surfer, the film attempts at one point to flip gears and make him into an unwilling servant of a much greater menace, but one ends up caring a lot more about those millions of civilians who were presumably killed when he dug one of his little holes in the Earth's crust. This is not helped by the fact that when the Silver Surfer attempts to explain why he does what he does, it amounts to a lot of tell and no show.Not helping matters any is the parameters of the softcore PG rating. Exactly what convinced the MPAA this film was even nearly as adult in tone as either of the real X-Men films is going to be one of the great unsolved mysteries years from now. The action is about as intense as the effort with which I blow my nose, and only a delusional crackhead could find any suggestive content here. You could probably shave another five minutes off this film and get it a G rating in Australia. And when you consider that this film is dealing with the possibility that every life on Earth might be extinguished, such beating around the bush is simply not on. I am not saying that the film needs to be another RoboCop, but when you present the audience with a situation in which people will inevitably be killed, reminding the audiences that there are consequences to detaching a chunk of a building from its foundations is actually a good thing. And no, the impalement at the end does not count, because like one of those ghastly Narnia films, the director cannot resist the temptation to invoke the magic reset button.Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer is the epitome of what I call a two out of ten film. Even twenty-five years ago, I would have told the nearest adult to turn this kiddie trash off.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Same average/Hollywood acting, nice special effects, and weak writing. And like the first one, the people in charge decided to not follow the comics. And yet again, I'm left shaking my head.

They probably would have saved money since his craft is just a huge orb. Why make Alicia Masters black?

89,vip_ebriega,Better but still not 'Fantastic'.,4,15 May 2008,"My take: Although better than the first, it's absolutely nothing to be wild about. I wasn't exactly anticipated when I heard that they were releasing a sequel to 2005's FANTASTIC FOUR, for I didn't actually like that film. But still, I went out to see it on a premiere night during the last few days of the summer. Like I expected, the film is filled with special effects. Surprisingly though, it was better than the first film. Unlike the first, this sequel actually has a real villain, much more compelling than the banal Dr. Doom, who is still here and still played by Julian McMahon (but thankfully, not as major as in the original). The villain is actually a quite interesting character since it is actually given a back-story unlike the other characters. The comedy is is improved as well, and some are actually funny.FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER is better than the first film, but it's still not a very good film on its own. The film is still mediocre when it came to writing a story and a bunch of interesting characters. The characters here are just the same forgettable pieces of cardboard cutouts in the first film. Besides fighting the arrival of the Silver Surfer (voiced by Laurence Fishburne) who has manipulated weather and produced mayhem at the process, Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffud) and Sue Storm aka The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are getting married, and their the target of many controversies. I don't give a damn! That pathetic subplot could have been removed and still create a movie, but only less as pathetic as it is right now.As a special effects creation, The Silver Surfer is OK. As a matter of fact, had they centered the movie on the story of this character, I think it might have been better (might!). Instead, it centers on a bunch of uninteresting cardboard cutouts, not to mention the return of Chris Evans' overly annoying playboy Human Torch character. FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER is not a totally awful film, but I still can't recommend it higher than a worthy rental.Rating: ** out of 5.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
90,phubbs,Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5,2 June 2014,"The dreary sterile foursome are back...rubbery bloke, fat rock thing, the flaming flamer and woman with really obvious fake blue contacts and blonde hair. This time in a bid to actually make an interesting film they've added an actual antagonist...or have they. Oh no my mistake he actually turns out to be another good guy whom everybody thought was bad. So who is the bad guy this time?? well I guess its Doom again...oh no he's working with the Four...until the very end when we get one single battle and a large cosmic cloud, oh geez Hollywood.Yep so we've had the obligatory origins part of the franchise that took up the entire first film, now things can step up a gear...right??!! Well no not really, this time most of the film simply revolves around the marriage plans of Mr Fantastic and the Invisible Woman...yes *deflated acceptance of the truth*. Yep as the two love birds are trying their best to get hitched admist the usual cartoonish childish tomfoolery of the other team members, the Silver Surfer pops up from outta nowhere.So even though the rest of this film still generally looks as poor as the first film at least the Surfer does actually look pretty slick, no pun intended. Admittedly it shouldn't be too hard to capture the Surfer's look, how could you fudge it up?! (ahem!), but yes he does looks really nice here as does his board. That doesn't excuse some plot issues though, apparently the board is a beacon for Galactus the cosmic cloud, but why? does Galactus own the board and he loaned it to the Surfer? what connection is there between the board and Galactus? I did always think the Silver Surfer's people on his home world all had boards like it was their mode of transportation, but in this film things aren't really explained and I've no idea how accurate it is to the comics.This leads to Galactus himself or itself. Yes in the comics we all know that Galactus is a big God-like humanoid with a nifty helmet, but in this film he's a big swirly cosmic cloud in space...he's been Bayformed. I understand the need to maybe conceal this mega characters true form to a degree (in his first movie appearance) so I can go with this myself, but I can also understand why some fans were upset with this way forward. Hollywood does this to some characters and it can be very frustrating I know, but leaving such a vast character to the last five minutes of the film doesn't help either does it. What bewildered me was the fact the Silver Surfer decides to wipe out or kill Galactus at the end...but why didn't he do just that right at the start before he was forced to destroy so many planets?! he could of done what he did (don't ask me what he did) ages ago for Pete's sake! eh? Oh and what were all those huge holes in the Earth in aid of exactly??The actual main heroes (the Four) are completely useless and just as annoying as they were in the first film...so I won't bore you further. Where as Doom is!...just the same as the first film *groan*. Somehow he gets released from his metal prison because of cosmic rays from the Surfer? whatever...and naturally plans dastardly plans to get even. The utterly stupid thing is even when the planet is clearly on the brink of destruction by Galactus, Doom is still being a dick and refusing to cooperate trying to keep the boards power for himself. Yeah that will do you good when planet Earth gets obliterated you utter utter cock.It all sounds exciting doesn't it, lots of action and CGI for the kids...yeah, great. Thing is just like the first film there isn't all that much action until the end again. We do finally get to see Doom have a proper battle with the Four and errr...lots of military blokes getting thrown around, one guy gets a hole blasted in him! But that's it really, the finale is just a big super powered energy explosion that makes no real sense but you just gotta accept it.I admit this film is much more fun than the first and visually more thrilling but a lot of that is purely down to the Surfer. Without this one character the film would be just as pants as the original, and even with this one character its not exactly brilliant. The problem being most of the film is filled with rubbish and characters you don't care about, plus it all feels so very puerile still...they added more childish visual gags! They broke the wall of semi reality within this universe by having Stan Lee play himself and being recognised as the comicbook uberlord that he is. Cute moment but it takes you out of the film, it makes a mockery of the whole movie...if that's even possible. On top of all that they still go ahead and end the film focusing on that stupid flippin' wedding and the same 4 logo motif in the sky! originality anyone?5.5/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
91,fwomp,Shootin' The Tube With The Silver Dude,6,25 June 2007,"The Fantastic Four are back in FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER ...dude.Slipping back into the latest comic-book-to-film wave, director Tony Scott (of the 2005 FANTASTIC FOUR feature) tries to shoot the tube by giving us another character from the original comics.And the story goes...Mr. Fantastic, aka Reed Richards/""Stretch"" (Ioan Gruffudd), and Sue Storm, aka The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), are trying, once again, to get married. Interruptions have stifled all attempts at matrimonial bliss and this time it comes from another world. The Silver Dude (voiced by Laurence Fishburn, AKEELAH AND THE BEE) has ""surfed"" onto Earth to do his master's bidding (see Destroy Planet Plan 101). Breaking through the planet's mantle, The Silver Surfer prepares each planet he visits for the impending arrival of a cloud of ...um ...stuff known as Galactus (the comic book showed this as a giant robot but apparently Tony Scott refused to have any kind of giant robots in his films).Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) stars as The Human Torch and the first of the fabulous squad to interrupt The Surfer's wild ride. Energy transfers between Silver-Boy and Torch cause fluctuations in Johnny Storm's abilities to light up. Anyone who touches Johnny, too, gets a touch of this transference and is quite funny when Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) trades powers with him for a few short moments.Mr. Fantastic has to help the military find a way to disable The Silver Surf all while trying to prepare for his wedding. Time is short for both and when The Surfer shows up near Reed and Sue's hitching place, the waves come crashing down on their celebration (bummer, dude).Racing to save the planet from The Surfer's seemingly incalculable powers, the military enlists surprise, surprise! Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). You really didn't think he was gone permanently, did you? Victor's able mind and talents help bring Silver-Boy down but oh! you know that ol' Von Doom mind. He's got other plans for The Silver Surfer's powers.Shortened by nearly 15 minutes from the first film, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer feels lessened in two significant ways. First is that there's almost zero explanation as to how the Silver Surfer became the creature he is. The ""love"" interest between what was Silver-Dude's woman far, far away doesn't explain much and leaves viewers caring little about him. The second is the rushed story focusing on booms! bangs! and gadgetry rather than the substance of the characters. The other issue some may have is that it ends with no resolution as to what happened to Von Doom or The Silver Surfer's all-powerful board (maybe he sent it out for a nice waxing).Even so, this is a fun, quick watch. It has some hysterically comical moments (almost all of which are thanks to Chris Evans' plucky Human Torch).Just don't expect much character and you might enjoy certain aspects.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

93,jon.h.ochiai,Silver Surfer Rules,9,19 June 2007,"When the Human Torch, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), first encounters the Silver Surfer he exclaims, ""Now that's cool!"" Yes, the Silver Surfer is so cool. It's this light hearted spirit and sense of wonder that propel Director Tim Story's ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"". ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a light year's improvement over the original ""Fantastic Four"". The Silver Surfer is the iconic figure that transcends to almost the spiritual in pop culture. Well, perhaps that is a bit much. Admittedly, the tale of the Silver Surfer is the stuff of classic mythology. Possessing the power to transform matter and energy in the cosmos at will, the Silver Surfer has few equals. Is the Surfer the World's destroyer or savior? As embodied by Doug Jones and voiced by Laurence Fishburne, the Silver Surfer is a mysterious paradox. The Surfer provokes unnatural disaster upon earth, and bares a calm and noble presence. The Fantastic Four seem no match for the powerful Silver Surfer. So what remains is distinguishing his intentions. The Silver Surfer ominously says, ""All that you know, is at an end."" This time around the storytelling by Don Payne, Mark Frost and John Turman is engaging, compelling, with a humorous feel for pop culture celebrity. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is also funny, in particular Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. As the story opens Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is about to marry Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) in what is tagged as the ""Wedding of the Century"". Theirs is a rock star's wedding. The Fantastic Four have attained rock star status. In fact Johnny (Evans) has incorporated the 4, and is even considering NASCAR-like sponsorship for their uniforms. In a hysterical touch Johnny's date confesses in an ""E!"" carpet interview that dating the Human Torch requires ""Fire proof lingerie and a lot of aloe."" The Thing, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), has settled into a stable relationship with Alica (Kerry Washington), who is blind.On the eve of the Richards Wedding, General Hager (Andre Braugher), enrolls Reed into discovering the source of a series of unnatural events taking place across the globe. Genius Reed soon deduces that source may be an anomaly of vast cosmic energy. Upon further examination: this propagating energy anomaly has left 7 destroyed worlds in its aftermath. The cosmic anomaly is the Silver Surfer, and he becomes an uninvited guest at Reed and Sue's wedding in New York. During Johnny's encounter with the powerful Silver Surfer something goes awry. In the meantime, arch nemesis Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) is resurrected. The Fantastic Four are coerced into an alliance with Victor to battle the Silver Surfer. Of course Victor can not be trusted.The compelling story is the Silver Surfer's. The Silver Surfer is the herald of Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds. The Surfer is bound by his word to Galactus. In a great scene with Sue, the Silver Surfer concedes, ""I have no choice."" What choice does the honorable and benevolent Surfer have, being that he has given his word to serve the malevolent Galactus? This is a hero's conflict with no easy resolve. ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a great hero's story with engaging heroes. Chris Evans is awesome again as Johnny Storm. This time around he tempers his flip charm and flashy charisma, with his fear of ending up alone. Ioan Gruffudd has a newly commanding presence. He mutes some of the dorkiness of the character, and embodies leader. Jessica Alba, stunningly beautiful, to her credit plays Sue Storm straight and true to her character. Alba has an endearing vulnerability, and a surprising strength. Michael Chiklis is solid as Ben Grimmunfortunately his talents are not adequately leveraged. Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne together bring the enigmatic Silver Surfer to life. The Silver Surfer is such a noble and charismatic force. And the Silver Surfer gives the movie its spirit. ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is awesome summer entertainment.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
94,DarthBill,It was... an improvement,5,10 October 2007,"Reed Richards, AKA: Mr. Fantastic (Gruffud) and Susan 'Sue' Storm, AKA: The Invisible Woman (Alba) are trying to get married, but every time the wedding day arrives, some end-of-the-world scenario gets in the way. Case in point: just as they're about to have their 4th attempt at a wedding, the Silver Surfer (body of Doug Jones, voice of Laurence Fishburne) touches down and designates Earth to be the next life sustaining meal for his grand master, Galactus. So it's up to Reed, Sue, Sue's younger brother Johnny, AKA: the Human Torch (Chris Evans) and their big orange buddy Ben Grimm, AKA: The Thing (Michael Chikilis) to save the day, complicated by Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) returning and stealing the Silver Surfer's surf board.Well, it's an improvement over the first film. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" has a slightly tighter focus and the action/drama/comedy blends together more smoothly than before, the sense of scale is better, the action sequences are spiffy - of particular note the sight of the fragmenting foursome struggling to save a collapsing ferris wheel is far more awe inspiring than Superman lifting the giant continent of Kryptonite in Bryan Singer's woe be gone 2006 turkey ""Superman Returns"" - and the Silver Surfer himself looks great. But Jessica Alba is still the weak link in the foursome; while Chikilis, Gruffud and Evans play their parts well enough, Alba's acting is simply not strong enough to be really convincing as the Invisible Woman. To be fair, Alba's not quite as annoying here as she was in the first film and manages to give the character a little more humanity, but still, she's just too much of a lightweight to really pull it off. And on top of that, the clearly Hispanic Alba (playing a white character) just looks silly with her hair bleached super blonde and sporting very fake looking blue contact lenses. And the continued use of Sue being caught with her clothes off in public fails to either amuse or even arouse, since Alba doesn't have the best body in the business, and even if she did, it would still be demeaning to the Invisible Woman, who was always a more classy, mature and wholesome comic book heroine, even if she did wear a skin tight blue suit. By having Sue repeatedly caught naked in public (or semi-naked), they're basically trying to force a sex appeal onto the character that was never really there to begin with, and I'm writing that as someone who usually enjoys seeing a good looking woman put on display. I'm writing this because I liked the Invisible Woman in the comics, she's easily one of the greatest female superheroes of all time, and to see her presented so poorly in the films is very disappointing.And as a friend of mine put it, Alba looks like she should be playing Evans' love interest instead of his OLDER sister (they were both born in 1981).And Reed Richards' dancing at his bachelor party outing will no doubt draw comparisons to ""evil Peter Parker"" dancing in the street to funky James Brown music in ""Spider-Man 3"".Dr. Doom's still not getting the best treatment either. Instead of a regal monarch, we're still dealing with a guy who's like a poor man's Lex Luthor in an iron suit. And turning Galactus into a giant cloud instead of showing him as the big god like creature that he is in the comics was just ridiculous.Perhaps an inevitable Fantastic Four 3 will be the ""charm""?",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
95,fernandoschiavi,"Fantastic Four is assumed as a superhero film that seeks to entertain without major commitments, and not try to bring depth to the plot",5,18 April 2020,"After the first film gross over staggering 330 million dollars at the box office over the planet, nothing more than obvious and expected a string quartet for Marvel. And this continued, again who is in charge is Tim Story (Taxi (2004) - that just making the same mistakes of the previous film, but getting to be slightly higher on some key factors.Here, the heroes are already accustomed with the powers acquired in the first film. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are preparing the last details before the wedding day. Already Johnny (Chris Evans) is still worried about getting into new girlfriends and ""sponsors"" for the group and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) is happily dating the beautiful Alicia (Kerry Washington) from the previous film. However, in the midst of wedding Reed and Sue, the Silver Surfer appears (body of Doug Jones with the voice of Laurence Fishburne), which controls the ""power cosmic"", absorbing and manipulating the cosmic energies of the universe and environment can fly at speeds virtually unlimited in your board, and announces the impending destruction of the planet. With their presence, Reed / Mr Fantastic is convened by General Hager (Andre Braugher) to locate and uncover the reason for his coming to earth. The quartet will still have to deal with the return of Victor Von Doom, Dr. Fantastic (Julian McMahon), who has a contact Srfista Silver and ends up proposing to Fantastic alliance to defeat the new threat to the planet.It is undeniable and laudable intention of the producers and writers to try to stay true to the comics. Even with the mistakes of the previous film, the story is generally faithful to the appearance of the characters. This time, the screenwriters Mark Frost (even from the previous film) and Don Payne, made an interesting mix of stories from comic to base this new adventure. References for this film will journal number ranging from 48 to 50, when it appears for the first time the Surfer - figures 57 and 60, when the Surfer is Dr. destination, and finally the magazine Fantastic Four Annual # 3 , ""The Wedding of the Year"" in October 1965 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, 1965, whose focus is the marriage of Reed Richards and Sue Storm.The early history of the Silver Surfer goes back to Galactus, the devourer of worlds, one of the greatest villains of the Fantastic Four. In the film they are keen to make it clear that he was known as Norrin Radd, a nobleman who lived on the planet Zenn-La, and to save his planet and his beloved, Norrin offered to serve eternally as a herald of Galactus, preparing the planets for its destruction climatically and geologically changing the places through which passes. And arguably the best character is the Surfer, represented perfectly by Doug Jones and merged with the voice of Laurence Fishburne. The character was created digitally and all seems very real. His facial expressions and movement is very well built and the scenes in which he participates are the Main action scenes of the film.The screenplay by Don Payne and Mark Frost based on a story by Mark Frost and John Turman is lean and has less than an hour and a half long, and bet especially in scenes of humor and the action scenes. It should also be noted the small number of action scenes, and a series of events that affect the flow of the plot, to be placed in a well-spaced. The climate is less ""juvenile"" than in the previous film and earns a more adult by its theme. The big problem is that there is a strange atmosphere throughout the film, because even before a real and dangerous threat against the end of humanity, still jokes are inserted all the time, immediately breaking the tension created some opportunities. Incidentally, in the mood, alumas scenes work well, like dancing in the disco elastic Reed during his ""bachelor"", their ""soft legs"" when you're about to get married, the fight grooms Reed and Sue, the scene in which Reed faces General Hager and Sue is ""thrilled"" with the courage and decided to air her future husband. But to remember is that the script has very weak dialogues and totally predictable.But some errors and problems are clearly evident, for example, when the Thing exchange powers with Johnny and suggests that rather have her old body back. In the first film, Reed had already managed to return to human form to it, then why did not he reverts to human form? If at the end of the first film he accepts who he had come to be assuming his new responsibilities, that he wanted to stick around to be human again. Another point worth mentioning is the speed with which Reed, Mr. Fantastic, develops equipment and technology that even the U.S. government and all its technology, can develop. In just a few days it can develop what was requested by the General Hager.The special effects are even better and well applied without exaggeration. Disappointing it is the final fight against Galactus. For those who followed the reading of clashes Fantastic Four against Galactus, the end is well below expectations. No one in the cast stands out, only Michael Chiklis again protrudes slightly with the Thing, and Jessica Alba again for its beauty abysmal. Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom is, as before - ham, expressionless, is ludicrous and yet presented with a horrific end to your villain.The soundtrack of John Ottman not supreende, and the photography of Larry Blanford contributes to the film, especially in its final half hour. Coupled with the well-chosen scenarios and a competent team of visual effects, especially in the composition of the Surfer, the delivered product is visually beautiful and attractive. Even in smaller quantities, the errors are still seen with the naked eye and compromise the final result, but compared to its predecessor, is the best script, the effects and brings the great Silver Surfer. Director Tim Story is still in a good mood the cult of celebrity and notoriously can better develop the characters.Has dramatic depth (despite the imminent end of the world) and it is an error of direction, but it is assumed as a superhero film that seeks to entertain without major commitments, and not try to bring depth to the plot (as in ""Spider-Man"" and ""Batman"" director Christopher Nolan) - the vision that we have regarding the film should be more flexible and be seen as just a fun and passenger entertainment, as indeed he was conceived.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

The first thirty minutes or so of this film has very little of why people go to these films and a whole lot of what Hollywood thinks makes a more complete film.All films are some form of escapism and require a ""willing suspension of disbelief"" so if unrealism isn't your forte than this picture isn't for you also if you cringe under expository,blatant dialogue this picture really isn't for you either.

Yet, to my surprise, I actually and thoroughly enjoyed myself! The same group dynamic that made these four so believable in the first movie is back. As is--and I was even more surprised, by this (despite his name being present in the opening credits)--Victor Von Doom!!The movie starts out with suitable eeriness, as the Surfer arrives on Earth, causing several weather anomalies reminiscent of that Demi Moore cult-classic, THE SEVENTH SEAL. With one of them occurring over a certain castle in Latveria.Reed Richards, multi-tasker that he is, has been analyzing these phenomena while pretending to be focused solely on his upcoming wedding to Sue Storm (their fourth attempt, as it turns out). Basically, he builds a miniature radio telescope that's capable of tracking the Surfer's cosmic energy signature. Which, in turn, leads to the Surfer crashing the wedding party and, thereby, ruining it.On top of all that, the now-famous chase scene--with the Surfer and Jonny Storm--makes the Human Torch's atomic structure unstable. Allowing him to switch super-powers with any or all of his teammates!Of course, that was really just the script writers' way of allowing Jonny to literally walk in the shoes of the other three. Because, he is, as Capt. Frankie Raye so accurately points out, ""...self-obsessed to the point of narcissism."" Thus, giving him a much-needed (and, perhaps, long-overdue) lesson in humility and unselfishness.If only SPIDER-MAN 3 could have gotten that point across a little bit sooner, it might not have tanked so badly at the box office.In any event, I loved this movie, immensely. I especially loved the tweaking of Galactus' appearance. Instead of a flesh-and-blood giant in purple armor, we get some kind of sentient energy being who camouflages himself in a giant cloud of interstellar smog!The only reason I don't give it a perfect ten? It's plausible that Reed could extrapolate, via computerized backtracking of the Surfer's energy trail, what other star systems the latter had visited. Yet, how could he know what planets in those systems had been drained of all life? And, how could he figure out the length of time it took?If anybody can think of a plausible answer, feel free to post it on the gray message boards.

103,DonFishies,"Has its problems, but does a much better job than the first film",6,7 July 2007,"I was never a big fan of the first Fantastic Four movie. Despite my limited knowledge of the mythos of that comic franchise, I could still tell how sloppily made the film was. It had a few good areas, but not enough to make it pass being merely watchable. After watching it, I held hopes for the obvious sequel, and whether or not it would be able to truly make the franchise fall in line with other superhero films. But while Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer does improve a few of the errors of the first film, it still is plagued with a lot of the same problems.Picking up some time after the events of the first film, the sequel finds the team still trying to wrestle between leading their lives, and the media circus that follows their every move (even down to the point where Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm/Invincible Woman's (Jessica Alba) wedding is the celebrity event of the year). But when a strange force begins to cause unnatural phenomena, as well as bizarrely gigantic pot holes around the world, the team is thrust into trying to stop it before it does any devastating harm to the planet.While the origin story in the first film was quite sketchy and dare I say stretched a bit too far in the literal and emotional senses, this second story is a bit of a mixed bag. It is definitely a lot more concrete and straight-forward, but there are plenty of moments where I sat wondering why it was being so jumpy with what was going on. The opening seconds of the film even has a bit of an integral plot device going on. It was surprising and a bit jarring, and became even more so when I realized just how quickly it ended. There was plenty of exposition, but there was just something missing from the overall storyline with it being so short and fast-paced.What also did not help was the juggling act the film did with its themes and its tones. At the drop of a hat, it jumped from slapstick comedy to a drama, to just bizarre science fiction. I know that the comics were known for their humour, but much like the first movie, a little bit of it feels a little ill placed. I did indeed get plenty of laughs from the odd pairing of Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Michael Chiklis), but much of the other humour seemed a little weary and flat in some cases. The shaky tone of the film probably did not help this (as even the music became quite whimsical when even confronting what should be an intense action sequence). The themes were also a bit of an issue, as they did not stay as straight and narrow as anyone could have hoped. They too jumped around, focusing a little too much in some places that did not matter as much as the places they did not focus on.The special effects on the other hand, have greatly improved since the last go around. No longer does Mr. Fantastic look completely computer generated. He actually looks like a living entity this time (even during his hokey dance sequence which was nowhere near as effective as the one in Spider-Man 3), and actually moves a lot more gracefully. Same goes for the Human Torch and the Invincible Woman, whose powers now look a lot more life-like, and a lot more natural than they did before. The star of the show, the Silver Surfer (acted by the impeccable Doug Jones and voiced by Lawrence Fishbourne), may not get a lot of real backstory, but he looks absolutely amazing. It is immensely hard to even realize that the character is not totally computer animated, and in fact, looks even more realistic than the powers the superheroes are wielding. Kudos to the filmmakers for putting some extra money into one of the key areas that needed help (although I think Galactus probably could have done with an extra touch of work).Sadly, two years has done nothing for Gruffudd and Alba. They still do not work well as their characters, and they work even less as a believable couple. A key plot element within the film is about their wedding that keeps getting postponed. But when you see these two interacting with each other, you will be hard set even trying to imagine how they co-exist. There is not even an ounce of chemistry between them, and the film suffers as a result of it. Gruffudd is just too lifeless in his role as Mr. Fantastic, and Alba is too classless for Invincible Woman. She plays the character more like a narcissist waiting for the right moment to run to the bathroom to throw on some more makeup than she does as a strong willed scientist who just happens to be a superhero.Evans on the other hand, is pitch perfect as Human Torch. He has the egotistical mannerisms down solid, and is just enough of a wise ass to truly feel authentically created by the comics. Chiklis is a lot stronger this time round, but is sadly, the most underused of the four. I would have liked a little more sinister villainy from Julian McMahon, who returns as Dr. Doom and has a lot more screen time than I ever would have imagined. A little more dialogue from Fishbourne would not have been a bad idea either.On the whole, the sequel does a better job than the original, and seems to be headed into the right direction if they make a third film. While it does have a lot of the same problems as the first movie, it does an adequate job making up for a lot of them. I just wish everyone in the main cast was as perfect as Evans.6.5/10.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
104,gigan-92,Let's See.,4,22 November 2010,"F+ You'll only be entertained if your under the age of nine to be honest. The first film was somewhat decent, but this one fell flat on its face. It's basically a big budget cartoon, although that's not even fair to say seeing as many Marvel cartoon series are actually rather good. So, I'll put it like this, some cartoons have more substance and are frankly more mature than this joke.It's run time is absolutely pathetic, so nothing is built up as it should have been. Some character moments are just plain stupid with dialogue so crappy you cringe a hundred times by the time the less than 90 minute film is over. Tim Story, our idiot director, made Johnny Storm annoying to the point I wanted him to sacrifice himself instead of the Silver Surfer, and Jessica Alba is just her normal ditzy self. None of the heroes interested me and the humorwasn't all that funny. The only interesting character was the Silver Surfer but he's killed off pretty quick before we got a chance to anything about him. A score that was as forgettable as the rest of it all as well.

This time around, the quartet of superheroes faces a planet-busting force, led by the one and only Silver Surfer. They chase the silver guy around the globe but have a tough time dealing with him An old foe, Doc Doom, is back from the first movie to screw things up. The action, all of it apparently CGI, is not always easy to follow or believe. Attempts at humor, which worked well in the comic pages, fall flat on screen, The gal playing Sue Storm is simply not up to the task, and should be replaced in any further sequels. The Silver Surfer himself appears to be purely CGI, or possibly motion-capture. Either way, this is not the Silver Surfer of the comic pages. The movie plods along from one set piece to the next.

You get to see his powers. What I don't understand is why he had to be in the Fantastic Four. The Silver Surfer should have its own movie - I think it's about time. I think it will do well at box office. The sequel is better than the first. That's cause it introduces an extra character named the Silver Surfer. Dr Doom is back, so that's nice to see. You also get to see Galactus towards the end. He eats planets in case you don't know. There's also a very short animated series of the Silver Surfer which is worth checking out. It has only thirteen episodes. It use to be on Fox Kids. The Silver Surfer there is better than the one in the movie. The movie had some funny moments. I like the trailer. The way the Silver Surfer was introduced was breathtaking! It got me interested. If you're a fan of the Silver Surfer, then this is the movie for you. Surprisingly! It's the only Silver Surfer movie.

107,Mr_Sensitive,Rise,7,3 July 2007,"Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is one of this year most awaited summer blockbuster and for me this got to be the most improvement of them all compare to Spiderman 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End. Or maybe the first one was pretty bad that it make this one look good, but for what it was this one is pretty entertaining.Synopsis: Fantastic 4 have a new mission, stop the Silver Surfer who has been terrorizing the planet after they learned that which ever planet the Silver Surfer visited, the planet dies within 8 days.I thought the film was very entertaining. The story is pretty good specially there is more stuff going on, though not much more it looks a whole lot more. It actually kinda has a lot of content that are similar to first movie. I like the idea where they reintroduce Dr. Von Doom to create a tense atmosphere. Though, I’m kind of disappointed that not much of character development at all, except for they have girlfriend.Silver Surfer got to be one of the best villains out there, and I’m glad they decide to choose him for this installation because he just doesn’t only look awesome, his ability is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately in this movie he was not able to show much of his ability and the only time you will see him doing anything is flying away from Torch and fighting with the army, which both scenes lasted just a few minutes.Apart from that it was the same old Fantastic Four with a little more action that is not really related to its villain. Mr. Fantastic and Invisible girl look much older than before. Torch gets much more screen time but somehow not as funny and memorable as the first and The Thing, what does actually the Thing do in this movie? Not really the part of the team at all.Despite complaining I got to say the movie was fun to watch. It is the same old mindless comical movie like the first movie but with vast improvement in CGI and much faster pace action and with more budget they now able to fight in different part of the world which is more pleasure to watch. Good for what it is.Recommendation: Yes, Watch It, Compare To The First This Is 10 Times Better.Reason to Watch: Silver Surfer.Reason Not To: Too Comical (But That What The Movie Go For).Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-).Please Rate (Y/N) After Read.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

The large majority of things happening is in the last 20 minutes of the film.I've only ever known The Silver Surfer as a good guy so him playing a heel here is pointless to me.

And, that will probably never change so I am now criticizing them on a curve.Two of the biggest flaws in this movie and the previous one, are the portrayal of Dr. Doom and the dialogue. Doom is played like a bad spin on Gordon Gecko and not the terrifying crazed armored scientist. And the sophomoric comic book dialogue doesn't mix very well with the ""real world"" look of the heroes. This makes for some cringe worthy moments like when this Doom is being chased by the FF and he yells ""Let's go a spin!"" right before he puts them in a whirlwind.The Surfer is somewhat acceptable and Galactus, IMO, should have either not been included or played exactly as he is in the comics.

The Four are still together and doing what they do best - make silly jokes amongst themselves and planning marriage and such. It wouldn't be a superhero comic if there wasn't someone to add a thrill to the story though and so there is the arrival of a strange phenomenon on planet Earth in the form of a silver surfer. So, investigation starts. And that is much of the story of this film. Which is OK, this type of films doesn't need a thousand page book to back it, it just requires fun, nice action sequences and some slick graphical effects.The first film was more or less OK, it wasn't anything worth watching twice but was fun for a bored Sunday afternoon. This sequel is in my eyes a small bit better, but not much. It still is a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon, and still isn't worth a second watch. The bit of storyline there is is worked out well enough and some bits of the film were actually very funny. Some other weren't though and that made the total a little too inconsistent to become truly captivating.Graphic wise this one is pretty well. Most of the used effects are convincing enough to keep one watching the film instead of moaning about horrendously bad effects.

I grew up with super heroes like Batman, Superman and the Fantastic Four. It's just too bad that number one Hollywood has become so devoid of original ideas that they have to keep doing the same thing over and over again and number two its too bad that if they are going to use Marvel material that they don't take the time to get it right. The other thing that really ticks me off is that Hollywood also seems to be devoid of good writing. If a good writer had been on this film it might have been much better. The subplot might have been interesting to explore if it hadn't been messed up by cheesy, stupid dialog. The whole issue of fame is a much needed discussion for our times.

Julian McMahon did a marvellous job on the first film, and he does an even great job in the sequel. Doug Jones is a master of mime and really brings the Silver Surfer to life. With a slight CGI touch-up and a Laurence Fishburne voice which didn't distract, the Silver Surfer was introduced as an amazing comic book character. The atmosphere of the movie was very different this time, but for the better. There was still some slight moments which felt like they didn't belong in the film, and Mr Fantastics elastic CGI moments still looked a bit off, but apart from these minor gripes, 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' was a improvement and a lot more enjoyable.""My name was Norrin Radd."" - The Silver Surfer (Laurence Fishburne)",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
114,estreet-eva,The Dodge of superhero movies,3,24 November 2015,"Perhaps the dopiest supervillain or superhero depending on the point in the film in the Marvel universe is the ridiculous Silver Surfer. Literally he's a spaceman on a surfboard. One imagines Stan Lee struggling with a looming deadline ahead of a beach vacation and just rolling with whatever the first idea that came to mind. Given a whole movie around this loser concept, the film had an institutional upper limit on quality. Not that it worked hard to overcome the Silver Surfer handicap. The film growns under the weight of extensive product placement for some reason mostly around mediocre products most notably Dodge motor cars (one imagines the Fantastic Four quickly tired of going to the dealer to solve minor quality hiccups with their Dodge Fantasticar). It also struggles with Chris Evans and Michael Chilkris clearly feeling upstaged by their more talented, attractive and necessary members of the foursome so much so they spend a distracting amount of the movie breaking the fourth wall. While o plot, characters, acting and advertising all come in sub optimal, it would be remiss to not notice the smaller, inferior details. Why did Costume Design just recycle the one-piece blue and black unitards from ""Stark Treak Next Generation"". More importantly, did women have to take the whole thing off in order to pee? The Silver Surfer most remains unresponsive to the hero's questions but he does answer some queries particularly around his romantic interest back home. Does he just not understand the heroes or is it that he finds their dialog not worth of responding to much like most of the audience feels about the script? The film poses many questions, the most of important of which is whether you can get some of your ticket price back. In short, keep in mind that Marvel produces so many superheroes that most won't be that good.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

116,diac228,Rated PG. Same staff from the original. Same actors. We might have a problem here,3,16 June 2007,"Not only does the entire cast of the original Fantastic Four return for a second installment, the flaws make a return as well. Whether it's the painfully obvious product placement, the bad acting, lack of action, cheesy lines, pointless scenes, lack of chemistry amongst the main two characters, low usage of the villains, mediocre treatment of the villains, lack of character development, or the abundance of jokes falling flat, Rise of the Silver Surfer is practically a prettier and more polished version of the original failure film. While it is a much more entertaining movie than the first, it still needs a bit more work in order to even compete with the hotshot comic book franchises like X-Men, Spider-Man, and Batman.In Rise of the Silver Surfer, we see the Fantastic Four preparing for the wedding of the century, as finally Reed and Sue are getting married. However, there are new threats approaching, hindering the wedding and also messing with the fate of the world. An alien from outer space is entering Earth and creating massive craters for unknown reasons. To add to the mayhem is a return of an old villain, whose hatred towards the heroes is stronger than ever. Upon all this lies an even greater danger lurking deep in space. Quite a lot for a film that's only 92 minutes. This would explain the lack of development and lack of action sequences.We can start by bashing the acting. Besides the performances of Chris Evans (Human Torch) and Michael Chiklis (The Thing), the acting in Rise of the Silver Surfer is rather awful and laughable, even at the more emotional moments. There are several scenes in which are accidentally funny, and many lines awkwardly delivered, especially that by Ioan Gruffudd (Reed) and Julian McMahon (Dr. Doom). Not supporting the lack of decent acting is the writing, which becomes just as dreadful. There is a lot of cheesy dialogue in this movie, and while the story had potential, ultimately doesn't deliver because of the lack of screen time share by the Silver Surfer and Dr. Doom. Most of the movie we see the Fantastic Four fighting and bickering amongst themselves, while the villains kick back and wait for their moment to shine.There are many good stories in the Fantastic Four comic books; it shouldn't be that hard to flesh out a good storyline involving the heroes and villains. The handling of the villains and enemies are just as bad as in the original. Dr. Doom is one of the roughest scoundrels in all of Marvel, yet is limited to a mere joke and side note in the second installment. Doom was wreaking a bit more havoc the second time around, but yet again doesn't deliver the sense of danger and fear that is presented by over villains in other comic book films. The Silver Surfer is heavily underused, as he was able to showcase his cool-looking powers in just one chase sequence and another run-in later in the movie. Also not helping is how the audience is never able to explore the origins or the motivations of the mysterious being. Worst of all is the totally unique image and portrayal of the planet-eating monster Galactus. There are comic book fans that will squeal in anger upon seeing its appearance.The short action sequences of Fantastic Four were nicely handled and drawn-out, but just didn't last long enough. There weren't enough showdowns, not enough epic battles, and most certainly did not deliver on the climax. By the end we'll see stupid departures and a slew of cop-outs, as well as anti-climactic scenes, massive plot holes, and unnecessary emotionally heavy moments (you'll see why). The special effects were a mixed bag as well, as the Silver Surfer and doomsday effects were done nicely--but then contradicted by the effects of the Fantastic Four in action (especially the stretching done by the main character). Add a ridiculous dance sequence, bad jokes sprinkled, and blatantly obvious product placement, and we have ourselves the biggest disappointment of the summer blockbuster season.Bottom Line: With so many things wrong and going against it, Rise of the Silver Surfer disappoints and is a letdown in almost every single possible way. Granted its better than the original, the franchise still needs major changes, or at least a totally different cast. Is it too late for a Fantastic Four Begins? Seriously, stop making a joke out of the enemies. Stop screwing around with a potentially good franchise. This movie isn't going to attract any new fans nor would it please the people already fans of the comic book. Skip this and read the books, you'll be much more entertained and have a better chance of feeling like you got your money's worth.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
117,nobbytatoes,still struck by its limitations,5,24 June 2007,"The Fantastic Four comics were the crown jewel in the Marvel comic book cannon, being the most popular with fans. So it's disappointing (or poetic depending on your stance), that the film adaptations sit on a mediocre level. The first installment weighed heavy with flaws, a thin screenplay, uninspired acting and bland directing. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfers, pulls out the trump cards to pull this franchise from the murk, yet ends in a case of flashing their cards to early. All the usual tricks of a sequel are here; bigger action set pieces, more enemies with more layers reveled in the protagonists. Script writers Don Payne and Mark Frost attempt to rise above the flaws from the first installment, with inner turmoils of the four leads, while fighting their new foe, but this never amounts to anything captivating. Being stuck in the media light, Johnny's power crisis, Sue and Reed's relationship problems and constant wedding postponements, great material to mine for character development, but Payne and Frost only scratch the surface, while still writing some cringe worthy and emaciated dialog. Director Tim Story's pacing faults proceedings, jumping from problem to action scene to problem to action scene. There seems to be notes taken from X-Men 2, yet Singer took time and found even ground for character development and big action pieces. Story seems to have too much on his plate, implementing too many elements in a short time frame. The set pieces, while imaginative and fast paced, are short and end just when they are about to lift off into eye candy spectacle. The confrontation with Dr. Doom is impressive, while the real enemy Galactus is gone as fast as it arrives. Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, and Michael Chiklis reach for their best, but have forgettable performances. Chris Evans, while down playing Johnny's cocky side, seems far from his talents, after pulling one mesmerising performance in Sunshine. Julian McMahon seems to be having fun as Dr. Doom, while being under used. Doug Jones displays the best performance as the nearly expressionless Silver Surfer. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer has tripped on its way to sit beside its comic book peers.

118,Okonh0wp,"While it feels like a 2nd tier movie, it's still a pretty fun action flick",6,17 June 2007,"If the critics had their way, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer would never have been made. They pretty much unanimously bashed the first Fantastic Four film, yet the film went onto a very respectable 56 million dollars opening weekend en route to a 154 million dollars overall.I haven't yet seen the first film but if it's anything like the sequel, it isn't too hard to see why critics might feel like this franchise is a second-tier version of X-Men or Spiderman. The special effects can be pretty impressive at times. The London Eye sequence, for example, and the airborne battles are great set pieces. If I hadn't been introduced to Google Earth in the last couple of years, I would have been blown away by the scene where the Human Torch first chases after the Silver Surfer where the frame zooms out of Manhattan to a satellite photo of the Eastern seaboard as a flaming red speck and a silver fly across it. The problem, however, is that the special effects and the world they're set in do not seem well thought-out. Having the Human Torch and Silver Surfer bounce around from New York to Washington D.C. to outer space and Cairo without much second thought, almost feels like something out of a ripe-for-parody 1950's B movie.That's the case for a lot of this movie: a villain with the name Dr. Von Doom (could they have been any less subtle?), this general blasé feeling by every character in the film about the world ending, etc. Take a film like ""Independence Day"" to see a somewhat more grandiose vision of our world as it faces a doomsday scenario. In ""The Fantastic Four,"" Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) massages her husband's shoulders as he's being a work-a-haulic and says, ""Relax, it's not like the whole weight of the world is on you."" Actually, that's kind of EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. Batman is a superhero franchise that's set in ""Gotham"" and with it, this dark otherworldly atmosphere and Superman weaves together the world of the mundane in Manhattan with extraordinary abilities of Spiderman and his villainous counterparts. On the contrary, Fantastic Four, just appears set in Manhattan out of a lack of anywhere better to film it in. In short, Fantastic Four doesn't feel like a fully realized superhero film in tone.What makes up for it, in part, is a certain kind of camaraderie between the characters. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkis) both are characters imbued with a sense of humor and form a sort of Abbott and Costello chemistry. Besides just being eye candy, Sue (Jessica Alba) brings a sort of feminine balance to the group. Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) is the actual superhero of the group: the equivalent of Peter Parker in Spiderman or Wolverine in the X-Men series. Much of the drama centers around the choices he makes. When you see these four in interviews or press conferences, there's a chemistry between them all that makes them that much more appealing on screen.So overall, it's a decent action flick that pulls in some decent laughs but it's not necessarily a must-see event.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

They brought in the Silver Surfer into the plot. So basically the movie picks up two years later from the last movie, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are about to get married and things couldn't seem better. However, the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones) is sent from Galactus to destroy the earth and Doctor Doom returns to steal the powers of The Silver Surfer and now The Fantastic Four must save the Earth from disaster. Compared to the first movie, this one had a little more action and the addition of The Silver Surfer was a nice touch but still the Fantastic Four movies are not going to match up to the success of the ""X-Men"" or ""Spider-Man"" movies. Plus I also don't understand why they gave this movie a PG rating instead of keeping it PG-13? I didn't see a reason for them to lower the rating for this movie. I don't think there will be a Fantastic Four 3 because somehow I think it would only make it worse for the movies since they've turned out with two decent movies unless they can make it extremely better to blow our minds. But I would like to see a spin-off movie for The Silver Surfer. I also enjoyed some of the funny moments from Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis).

When a sequel is done properly and all the background information and origins are dealt with in the first film you can just crack on with the action. So welcome back Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben the Fantastic Four for some fantastic fun. With recent superhero films trying to go darker (Batman Begins, Ghostrider etc) it's refreshing to see a comic come to life with such humour and watch ability for the viewer. It never takes its self too serious and the jokes are as good as the action. The Surfer himself is pretty impressive as is Galactus (what you see of him) Victor Von Doom is back and hammier than ever and they even introduce the Fantastic car. The set pieces are great especially the one at the London Eye where the four battle the Surfer and contend with the falling wheel full of tourists. The storyline is solid and leaves enough room for every one of the characters to shine through, the effects are good and the music adds the finishing touches to the overall package.

The whole story about the wedding and the delays and Reed Richards' divided attention was just so adolescent. I know the movie is supposed to be comic book but couldn't the producers create something that appealed to people over 15 years old. The effects were technically impressive but pretty devoid of any real suspense. The characters were just clichés and the acting was just good enough for you to know that. Jessica Alba can't really act. She is really hot looking but utterly unconvincing and rather boring. I can't really say that this film is worth seeing.

124,curtis-8,Great Fun and a Great Relief,8,18 June 2007,"I thought ""FF:Rise of the Silver Surfer"" was great fun. I'm glad that Tim Story and crew managed to completely ignore the bad press the last film got and just forged ahead with their vision for # 2 (of course, they were helped by a $158 million take at the US Box Office for the last movie).I've nothing against the Batman-Style angst-ridden superhero genre, but after they angst-ed up Superman, the most positive of heroes, I knew that the ""dark superhero"" thing had just become a cliché in its own right. Every freakin' superhero has to be miserable for some reason. Bloat is the other Superhero movie ailment. Even the feisty Spiderman franchise has finally caught the ""Too Many Villains, Too Many Plots-itis"" disease from Batman. So, depression and confusion rule most of today's superhero movies--except for FF. The Fantastic Four have so far avoided both these traps. For the most part, the film shows having superpowers as being fun. In keeping with the original comic, the super-characters in the FF films do have problems like other folks-- but not deep, dark, brooding problems. And ""Surfer's"" plot, while typically comic book fantastic, is comparably straightforward and linear. AND, I might add, free of flab. No three hour epic here. Just a tightly composed entertainment that runs about 90 minutes--like an action movie should.To sum up--I liked it a lot! And I predict another hit and another installment in the works!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
125,ExpendableMan,A forgettable but fun sugar rush movie,7,17 June 2007,"Okay, before we get into the meat of this analysis, let's get one thing perfectly clear: the Fantastic Four are NOT cool. They're too wholesome. Their teeth are too shiny and white. They look utterly ridiculous in those stupid blue jumpsuits they wear. Batman is cool. Spiderman is cool. The Fantastic Four, are not. But in some respects, this actually works in their favour.No no, hear me out, the reason why Rise of the Silver Surfer does a good job is because it does exactly what it says on the tin. You go in expecting frivolous nonsense that's cornier than a weekend in Kansas and that's precisely what you get. Unlike the bloated, over-complicated and over-ambitious Spiderman 3, it manages to deliver an energetic and fast paced storyline, decent special effects, eye-popping action sequences and all in a succinct hour and thirty three minutes. There's none of the ""let's cram as many villains in as possible"" approach that the web crawler had earlier this summer and while it's undeniable that this is definitely a superhero film with a kids market in mind, it still makes for an entertaining jolt of fun and a decent alternative if you get the family to the local multiplex only to find that Pirates 3 has sold out.Of course, it's not perfect by a long shot. Galactus for instance makes an eagerly anticipated screen appearance...for about thirty seconds, then vanishes. And if that wasn't bad enough fanboys, he's no longer a giant Roman Centurion wearing an over-sized purple helmet but an ominous looking cloud of dust, rock and magma that's come to eat your babies. Plus, there's a wealth of glaring plot holes that even the kids will be able to pick up on, like the American military letting a man who calls himself Doctor Doom into the middle of a top secret research facility. Perfect fodder indeed for anyone who may be getting a bit fed up with the continuing cycle of movies populated by photogenic spandex models and wants to have a good moan.This doesn't count for anything though so long as when you order apple pie, you want to receive apple pie. Rise of the Silver Surfer has flimsy characterisations, cheesy smiles and unnecessary romances aplenty, not to mention a couple of incredibly silly set pieces to get stuck into. The Human Torch's collision with Doom for instance is an absolute riot, as is the high speed mid air chase over the Great Wall of China, while the Silver Surfer unleashing his fury on the army is liable to make jaws drop. Older, cynical audiences may want to stay away but provided you haven't spent all your cash on the previous summer blockbusters, the continuing adventures of Rubber Man (Ioan Gruffudd), Orange Woman (Jessica Alba), Hulk 2 (Michael Chiklis) and Southern Fried (Chris Evans) are still an enjoyable sugar-rush for everyone that's still a kid at heart. Throwaway guff, but arguably better than Spiderman 3.And oh yeah, the Silver Surfer is totally, totally awesome.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
126,ReelCheese,Battle Against Mediocrity,5,14 October 2007,"Not even the world's greatest superheroes can defeat the mediocrity of FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER.This time around, our heroes are little bit older, a little bit wiser but still coming to grips with their incredible powers. Reed Richards, aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) is about to finally marry Sue Storm, aka the Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba). But then, as it inevitably does in these kinds of movies, all heck breaks loose. It seems some mysterious force -- the Silver Surfer, we soon learn -- is gradually draining the Earth of its life.The plot is suitably comic-book-like, but RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER becomes increasingly mired in a string of CGI-reliant action scenes that are as dizzying as they are fake-looking. Whereas most films have the viewer anxiously waiting for the next injection of action, this one has us wishing director Tim Story would instead flesh out the less-flashy, human angles. In any event, some of the story doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. While many superhero films can get away with that, it hurts this effort more than it would most simply because the film hasn't much else going for it.Perhaps the film's biggest asset -- literally and figuratively -- is Michael Chiklis as The Thing, a lovable lug made of craggy, orange rock. As he was in the 2005 original, he is a sheer delight, particularly when forced to endure the mischief of Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch (Chris Evans). Chiklis flawlessly captures a comic book character in a way few other actors ever have.As a long-time fan of these four fantastically odd heroes, I wanted to like RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER as much as anyone. I gave it many chances to redeem itself. It did not. It's quite a disappointment.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
127,tburke85,Fantastic Four 2 Better Then First One But Still Flawed,6,5 June 2009,"Fantastic Four Rise Of The Silver Surfer is better than the first one but it still has some flaws that are in the previous film. Director Tim Story does an okay job of bringing this movie based on a comic book to the big screen with more action and improved special effects but the camp factor hurts the movie as a whole. The cast are good in their roles including Ian Grufford as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/ The Human Torch, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and Julian McMahon as their nemesis Victor Doom. Kerry Washington is all right as Ben's girlfriend Alicia but unfortunately she isn't given nearly enough screen time. Besides Evans as Johnny and Chilkis as Ben who stand out in the cast one of the best things about this sequel is the introduction of the Silver Surfer. In his first big screen appearance his character does leave an impression. He's played by Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne provides the voice for the character and they both do a solid job as the newest and more interesting foe/ally to the Fantastic Four. The rest of the cast are good in their small roles including Andre Braugher and Beau Garrett who at least try to bring life to their characters but unfortunately they lack screen time. As mentioned before the special effects and the action sequences are better then the first one but they're not as near as good as they could've been since none of them really even last that long. Some other problems I found with the film was that McMahon's character Doom didn't really need to be in it because they already fought him in the first one. McMahon makes for a good villain but his character takes a backseat to the Silver Surfer who at least to me is a much more worthy adversary with an interesting back story. A few other flaws were that it seemed Michael Chiklis lacked screen time too as The Thing and he wasn't involved in the action as much as he was in the previous one but he still turns in a good performance. The dialgoue wasn't the greatest at times either and the planet eating Galactus a popular character in the comics is given a brief cameo as this cloudy mist thing from outer space only showing up a couple times here and there before being easily defeated. With its problems aside however this sequel is still an entertaining comic book movie with good performances by most of the cast, just the right amount of action, some humor, cool special effects, and a little romance that keeps the film moving at a steady pace. If you're a fan of the first movie than you'll probably enjoy this one as well.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
128,arieliondotcom,Faintly Flawed Fun,7,11 May 2008,"My favorite Marvel hero will always be Spiderman and I'm still looking for my real-life version of Mary Jane. But Fantastic Four has their moments. They're fun and this movie has that, along with good special effects you've come to expect. There's not the pathos that was in the original with Ben dealing with his transformation so there's not much of an opportunity for real plot or real acting here, but it's okay.For some reason I kept getting distracted by Sue turning into the Botox Bimbo though. I couldn't stop getting distracted at how (unintentionally) exaggeratedly large her lips are through the whole movie as if they are somehow part of her super powers now. I kept expecting everything but her lips to be invisible. It reminded me of those horrible old cartoons of the 30s and 40s where Black people were portrayed with these huge, bulging lipsAnyway, the film is not (in my opinion) up to the acting of the first one, because of the lack of pathos. But it has a few chuckles and the special effects to make it a fun if not fantastic flick..",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
129,higherall7,O where for art thou Galactus?,7,9 March 2012,"The career of Stan Lee, like that of Muhammud Ali, are two things I can proudly say I was there at the beginning to experience. Amusing to see Will Smith in rightful blatant hero worship of the man as his film 'ALI' premiered, mugging with him in photo shoots. But I remember when he started out as Cassius Clay, a loudmouth braggart everybody was just chomping at the bit to see get his comeuppance one day. I can hear my father chuckling as he glanced at me from his copy of the DETROIT FREE PRESS, ""Now you gonna see what happens when you brag too much..."" This just before the first Liston fight...And what award did Stan Lee win to distinguish 'THE FANTASTIC FOUR' as 'The World's Greatest Comic Magazine'? He was about to quit the Comic Book Industry when his wife advised him to go out 'doing his own thing' and now here we are in the Twentyfirst Century commenting on the latest incarnation of 'THE FANTASTIC FOUR'. Blessed with a flair for hype and self promotion (remind you of anyone who floated like a butterfly?) and the visionary prowess of the great Jack Kirby the truth of the Marvel Universe is still marching on.What a bunch of street kids saw in mighty Marvel in between lob ball and lemonade on hot summer days racing across the grit and gravel of the Hutchinson Elementary School playground, the world would finally come to appreciate after about a fifty year communication lag. The gang fights and the rumbles with the Incredible Hulk about '-who da MAN?-' and Peter Parker trying to make an honest buck out of a spider's bite while Doctor Strange was finding out that the skill the Good Lord giveth he can just as well take away AND your penthouse too; now the rest of the world is finally getting with the program. But awww- you're all just johnny-come-latelies, so why don't you just sit down before you hurt yourselves?After all, it took the College kids ten to fifteen years before they could appreciate that they were walking around with the pulp fiction equivalent of storyboards detailing the wonders of the universe in their pockets that could not be filmed because CGI wasn't even out of its diapers yet. Meanwhile, Captain America was waking up out of a natural cryogenic sleep compliments of World War II and the Submariner as Doctor Doom planned to take over as landlord of the Baxter Building and send the Fantastic Four into outer space before their lease was up! Now the film industry is finally gearing up and starting to track with the groundwork already laid out in the Marvel Age of Comics and in many cases before present company was even born. Some are grousing that the present incarnation of the Marvel Superheroes does not measure up to original times and they have no idea how right they are. But I remember when The Amazing Spiderman had acne and flatfeet and looked like the fellow who got sand kicked in his face before Charles Atlas promised him he could be 'BIG'! I remember when there were ink spots over the pictures and the Beast walked out on the X-MEN because he was sick up to here with all the training to protect ungrateful Earthmen and left the Cyclops standing by the window looking out after him stomping away to hit the road.How right you are that the present Reed Richards doesn't look anything like Burt Lancaster whom he was originally modeled after, nor does Ben Grimm favor Jack Dempsey when he's not doing The Thing trip. Nor does Sue Storm look like the beauty queen from 'TARZAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE', but she'll do in her own way. I would love to see what a young Michael Landon might do with the Johnny Storm character, but of course, those days are long gone.At least the Silver Surfer looks decent and moves and acts the way most everybody imagined him, but in the Marvel Age of Comics Sue Storm would have croaked in Reed Richards' arms and the real Galactus would have come stepping out of his cloud to debate with The Watcher how come Earth should not be on the menu. Everything would have faded to black just like when the Dread Dormammu sent Doctor Strange slippin' into darkness to disappear into nothing but the black ink of the last panel. There would have been a real 'THE WRATH OF KHAN' moment then, and when it came to the third installment of 'THE FANTASTIC FOUR', you would not have to say '-y'all come back now, hear?-'But guess what? This is exactly how the Marvel Age of Comics started in the sixties! Standing on shaky ground, a little anxious and unsure of itself while aliens invaded the bodies of Earth's adolescents, doing their research and drawing their plans until the age of nineteen when such members finally come of age.And it really is a gas to see the Marvel Universe finally come of age here in the Twentyfirst Century where it belongs after all its growing pains! Cudos to Tim Story and cast and crew for taking these super heroes into their latest and so far greatest evolution! Excelsior! The best is yet to come!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
130,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,A great improvement over the first. Fantastic fun again.,8,14 June 2007,"Tim Story stays true to the roots of the 2005 film, keeping this sequel fun and clean, while developing a new story with a couple new characters and making our favorite 4 heroes grow even more. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is better than its predecessor, and one of the better sequels of recent memory.Things appear to be going great for the Fantastic Four. Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan (Jessica Alba) are in love and ready to be married, Johnny (Chris Evans) is still on fire with the ladies, and Ben (Michael Chiklis) has finally found happiness with Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington). However, their happiness will be tested when strange occurrences around the globe point to one culprit: a mysterious being known only as The Silver Surfer (Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne).One of the biggest improvements 'Rise' has over the first film is the fact that the Fantastic work more as a team in this film. Yes, in the first movie they fought together, but it seemed as if they each were fighting different battles within one big one. Here, they take a different route and take on even the smaller events together. Also, the writing is much better, making Reed aka Mr. Fantastic out to be the leader of the Four, much unlike the first movie, which bothered me. Ioan Gruffudd really seems like a leader in this movie, which was a definite strength. Chris Evans also flexes some acting muscle, as The Human Torch is also well written this time around, giving him a wake up call and turning him into a more believable human character this time around. Alba and Chiklis are both good as The Invisible Woman and The Thing respectively. Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne portray the Surfer brilliantly as body and voice respectively. Fishburne has this incredible ability to say the deadliest of lines (All that you know is at an end) with unbelievable ease and charismatic calm. He is the perfect choice as the voice of one of the most powerful comic book characters. I liked how they wrote the Surfer as well. He does become vulnerable in the film, but at the same time, you'll have no doubt that he is the most powerful character by the time the ending rolls around. Doug Jones always impresses me with how he captures and creates a character while doing so little, and after successful turns in Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy, Jones gives the Surfer life just as he did Abe Sapien in Hellboy. Kerry Washington and Julian McMahon are also good reprising their roles as Alicia Masters and Dr. Doom, McMahon especially. He's even better as the evil and manipulative Dr. Doom this time around.Tim Story really did a good job with the atmosphere of 'Rise'. He really explores every corner of the planet, with action scenes in Germany, New York, China, outer space, and the heroes' kitchen. All the action scenes are well done and the special effects are used smoothly and effectively, even though it looks as though most of the increased budget was spent on The Silver Surfer and Galactus, who look amazing. They forgot to make Mr. Fantastic look as realistic as possible, because most of the time you can see the visual effects. All in all, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (PG) is a fun movie experience that anyone over age 11 or 12 should enjoy. There is some mild sexual innuendo, but it's not too bad.--spy 8/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
131,Jay_Exiomo,The surfer deserves better,5,13 June 2007,"In all its silliness and tongue-in-cheek disposition, the first ""Fantastic Four"" movie wasn't really a landmark as far as comic book films go. But it wasn't so bad either; it's just that after Marvel Comics' recent domination of the film genre, it's natural for one to expect that each of its characters having a shot at the big screen would present something legitimately entertaining to the audience. Something the first installment failed and the second struggled to achieve.In ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" the four superheroes are back once again to help everyone solve their gamut of problems. Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) is about to wed Susan Storm aka Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba). However, an unknown cosmic entity is causing a screw-up in earth's natural phenomena, prompting the couple to postpone the wedding, and work with Johnny Storm aka Human Torch (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm aka The thing (Michael Chiklis) to find out the cause of the mysterious occurrence. They soon come face to face with the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne) and realize that the world's survival is hanging on the balance. In addition to this, Victor Von Doom aka Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) returns and is intent on destroying the Fantastic Four.Granted, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" has a greater scale than its predecessor. But for all this, it's still very... middling. The title and the trailers suggest something of a grand battle between the eponymous characters but aside from the chase sequence involving the Human Torch and the Silver Surfer (which, by the way, has been shown numerous times in the teaser trailer), nothing much exciting still happens. Not even the team's rescue attempt in London. The quality of the special effects are inconsistent and all the visual polish expectedly goes to the Silver Surfer. (And while I personally don't think it's an issue, I imagine how some fans of the comic book might sneer at how the characters of Silver Surfer and Galactus were handled.) Instead, director Tim Story and screenwriters Don Payne and Mark Frost opt to flesh out the characters more but the end result feels less natural and more repetitive. Gruffudd does an okay job with Mr. Fantastic but there's really no feeling of chemistry between him and Alba, who manages to adequately portray a tough yet vulnerable character. In contrast, Evans and Chiklis continue to generate an easy rapport between them and the two get majority of the film's most amusing moments.""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" barely does what it sets out to do. It fares a little better than its predecessor with a more serviceable story and a little more enjoyable action sequences. But taken on its own terms, the film doesn't present anything to its characters that has been done much better with other characters of their ilk. The movie is entertaining to some extent but in the end, it doesn't really rise to something special.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

133,bazmitch23,So-so,6,14 January 2014,"There were a few things a liked about this film such as Michael Chiklis as The Thing (he also gets the best laughs in the film), Johnny showing a serious side to him, Alba in that skin tight outfit (we get some nice shots of her from behind), Laurence Fishburne's voice as The Silver Surfer (who better?) and Simon Webbe's song ""Ride the storm"" is awesome.But there are many things I disliked such as Alba's acting, her obviously fake hair, the fact that the military were stupid enough to trust Von Doom (did they not know what Von Doom tried to do to New York?), the Surfer's main reason for destroying planets is just explained in a very lazy ""Because I must."" Why? Also, I'm suppose to sympathise with a character who destroys innocent planets and kills innocent beings? And Sue's death scene was ruined by Alba's woodenness and from being very clichéd. And you gotta love how she dies. She just moves her head down and just has her eyes open. Also in that scene, Von Doom throws his spear at the Surfer and he doesn't run out of the way, so Sue sacrifices herself. How about using an invisible force field to knock the spear away, Sue? Like you always do.Also, how did the Fantastic 4's car get from America to Serbia very fast? And how were they able to get from Sebria to China really fast? Answer: Cos in Movie Land, you get from country to country in under 5 minutes.Another factual error is that when the helicopter crashes onto the roof and the blades are heading towards the blind girl. How comes she didn't hear it coming towards her and just stood there not knowing? Remember a blind person sense of hearing is a lot stronger.Also, the Mr Fantastic stretching effects still look weak and as for The Silver Surfer's reason for saving Sue: She reminded him of his girlfriend. So out of all the beings on every planet you destroyed, you just happened to find a being who looked just like your girlfriend?Earth is saved at the end, but shouldn't we feel sorry for the other planets Galactus destroyed?

134,jerekra,Power Cosmic?,5,28 February 2009,"I am a fan of the Silver Surfer. I have worked hard to unlock him in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, own the NES game Silver Surfer, and also have read a lot of the comics. I went to see this film because of him, not because I liked the first Fantastic Four Film.I thought that the first Fantastic Four film was average at best. I did not like the actors cast as Mr. Fantastic and Mrs. Fantastic. I think Jessica Alba is very attractive but she can not effectively portray Mrs. Fantastic. Mr. Fantastic's portrayal in the film is bland and not exciting at all. He just adds nothing to the screen and is very uncharismatic.I do like the Human Torch and I think he is the best portrayed of the four. He acts the way he was in the comics and that is good. The Thing is pretty cool also and he is pretty well portrayed also, easily the second best in these films.So I was banking on Silver Surfer helping to raise the film to greatness. Silver Surfer was great, but a few issues. For one, when he does not have his board with him he is able to still use the power cosmic to bring it back to him. He did not need the board to use his power all the time. In this film once he loses his board he is defenseless. They should have stuck to the comics portrayal of him. Surfer gets to do a lot of damage but he really does not fight anyone outside of Galactus and Dr. Doom briefly.I have issues with Dr. Doom. WHy did they decide to put him in this film? The reasoning behind why he was put in the film is so stupid. They should have known not to release him from his prison and choosing to release him just to help out the Fantastic Four borders on retardation.If anything they should have left Dr. Doom out of the film and made Galactus the main bad guy. Galactus is not the way he should be. He is just a huge cloud and looks nothing like how he does in the comics. That was a huge disappointment since he is one of the best Marvel Villains.There also is a lack of solid action. That was also an issue with the first film. A super hero film with a lack of action is bad.Not a very outstanding film. Silver Surfer was cool, but the rest is not.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

What's very prominent in this film (more than perhaps in any other Marvel Film) is the element of campy comedy which undoubtedly is what keeps the film afloat through it's less action-packed segments.All in all, it's nice to see the movie carries the torch of the previous one rather valiantly though you are left with a feeling that they could have done more to spice up the film. In all characterizations were okay and it's also nice to see some more character development for Johnny but the rest of the team weren't as prominent for some reason.The action is great, the comedy is nice and the plot and cast are solid.

The characters are fun and interesting, the action is mind-blowing, the villain is intriguing, and it actually ""feels"" like a comic book experience.With an improved plot from the first ""Fantastic Four"" film, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" makes you want another ""F4"" flick. The Silver Surfer is a more interesting villain than Doctor Doom, and the character's stories are enriched with new elements. For example, Reed Richards and Sue Storms' marriage is delayed by the arrival of the Silver Surfer. However, by the end of the movie Sue becomes willing to sacrifice what would be the perfect wedding to her and does what is sensible for a superhero trying to live a normal life. Johnny becomes more of a team player and not so obsessed about himself. Obviously, the Thing has come to accept who he is. When you add in incredible flying sequences at the end of the movie, and new weapons/vehicles to the lexicon of the Fantastic Four, and a plot with more depth, it makes for a fabulous sequel. Jessica Alba's acting is poor and the dialogue is sometimes weak, but everything else that's good about the film overcomes those minor discrepancies. 3/4 stars",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Rise of the silver surfer has the same rating as it's previous film, and that's what it deserves. I admit, the story is a little bit more tolerable and as in the first film, the film actually doesn't surpass the amount of cheesy moments the first one had. This meaning Rise is better, but better in a way where it is exactly the same as the first. Rise has way more (and pretty enjoyable)action sequences that also is better than the first. But the problem with Fantastic Four is that the film tries way to hard to be a serious superhero movie. It's a fun popcorn movie at the least but it comes nowhere to where you would want to see it in theaters or anywhere publicly.

However just like Lamborghini, the makers of the disappointing Fantastic Four went back to the drawing board and gave us this version of the Fantastic Four , only this time round they threw the Silver Surfer in for good measure and to be honest , The Silver Surfer was the one who probably saved this one this time round. Although the problems that arose with the first film are still very apparent with this one , it is the Siover Surfer appearing out of nowhere with his presence that ends up saving the movie and not to mention Julian Mchmaon who helped give Doctor Doom a little more justice this time round.

There was less time on individual characters dealing with their powers and more time on either the four as a team (or Sue and Reed as a couple) or the action.

140,rparham,Not a significant Rise of quality,6,17 July 2007,"First things first: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is better than its predecessor, 2005's Fantastic Four. However, that doesn't mean it's a great film. Rise of the Silver Surfer has more interest and mystery to it, indeed, but it still falls short of comic book adaptation greatness by a long shot. An over-reliance on sitcom style humor, a lack of satisfying action, and a weak villain don't serve the film well, making Rise of the Silver Surfer an underwhelming experience.As the film opens, Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are about to be married when strange occurrences across the globe are brought to the attention of the Fantastic Four. Water is frozen over when it isn't winter, it snows in the desert, and large craters begin appearing throughout the world. Reed tracks the radiation present at the events and eventually narrows it to a being that is flying throughout the world, composed of silver and riding a surf-board like object. He is dubbed the Silver Surfer, and after having been chased by the Human Torch ne Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), the Surfer is discovered to be more powerful than bargained for.Also interested in the Silver Surfer is a healed Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who has reappeared and offers to help for hidden nefarious purposes. The Fantastic Four and Doom join forces to attempt to thwart the Surfer and stop the destruction throughout the planet, but the Surfer appears to only be a taste of the danger that looms on the horizon.The story of the Silver Surfer is one of the iconic comic book plot lines, cherished by millions, and while Rise of the Silver Surfer does a better job of producing a somewhat entertaining film than Fantastic Four, this probably isn't what comic book fans are looking for. The film's principal problem is it's rather shallow, silly humor that gets in the way of the story having much in the way of any impact. The Fantastic Four aren't really developed much, and fail to resonate with the audience, so their petty squabbling proves tiresome and counterproductive to building any interest in the goings on that occur. When one key emotional scene arrives, you don't feel anything for the characters because you just don't care about them.Rise of the Silver Surfer is hampered by the return of its weak villain, Victor Von Doom, in the guise of Julian McMahon. While he has a bit more menace this time around, he is still not tremendously threatening or interesting, and has relatively limited screen time. Screenwriters Don Payne and Mark Frost also make the poor decision to create one of the stupidest characters in a film in recent memory, Army General Hager, portrayed by Andre Braugher. This character is so inept and silly that you can't help but shake your head in several scenes. Braugher, a terrific actor, deserves much better.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer does do some things right though. The visual effects that realize the Silver Surfer are exceptional, proving to be fairly eye-popping at times. And while the Silver Surfer isn't given much of any development, he does have a sense of mystery and threat to him that works at times, and in a key scene manages to earn a degree of pathos.That being said, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer proves to be just a slight notch above what came before, and not the home run many in the comic book community might have been hopelessly dreaming of (this reviewer included). It isn't a disaster, Superman IV and Return of Swamp Thing don't have to worry about being dethroned as the worst comic book movies ever, but it could have been much more.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
141,kooleshwar,"Thats It????!!!!!!,",6,28 June 2007,"This was my first reaction as the film ended and I'm sticking to it.BUT as I go from sequel to sequel,from Marvel movie to Marvel movie, and from OK movie to OK movie,so much ""MORE OF THE SAME"" is making it very difficult to write a relatively coherent, unemotional, and objective review.Im no fan but I've do some research on the comic movie I'm about to see.Few things are clear about the movie though.1)ITS A HARDCORE FORMULA (accounting for demographics)FLICK. (read my review of spider-man 3to know what I'm talking about).2)The budget was limited.3)AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IF EVER THERE WAS A Children's FILM THIS IS IT.The formula part is clear because.1)The FF visit so many countries, its funny how the powerful general is always black and how so many scenes show Asian Army Men (haha in real life i wonder how many senior ranking generals are black and how many Asians are in the Army).2)The special effects are strictly OK, Mr. Fantastic looks absolutely fake, Invisible woman does no invisible stunts (ones requiring extra CG), The Thing is there only to talk, all the special effects have been spent on Super Doom, Silver Surfer and Human Torch (and his super version).3)This movie is more like the cartoons of FF, everyone knows that save for the Galactus angle (he devours worlds but is a vital part of the universe) there is nothing dark about the FF, in this sense this movie is ideal for children, no violence, only one person gets hurt and that too not visibly, the messages are all there making the right choices,doing your duty,accepting what you are etc etc.The burping and bear jokes are clearly aimed at them, the DANCING IN THE CLUB ALA SPIDERMAN MAY HAVE BEEN FOR MULTIPLE TARGETS (women,preteens,children) If you want to take children for a comic movie and are afraid about the sexual/violent/dark themes than this is the perfect movie.IF YOU VIEW THIS MOVIE AS A Children's COMIC BOOK MOVIE THAN THIS MOVIE IS CLEARY AN 8-9/10, the only thing that pull it down is that even cartoon have more action (especially gun action though they always do no harm) then this movie).Now for the justification of the summary..I expected Jessica Alba to be hot BUT SHE WAS LOOKING HIDEOUS TO SAY THE LEAST, the signs were there when she kept going on record to say she wanted to look less sexy so people could take her more seriously as an actress YA RIGHT, FF is just the vehicle to prove your acting prowess.I expected there to be at least one really big scene, but after almost every scene is was satisfied but craving for more. (The Millennium Wheel and the first chase scene were really good though).The Thing and Torch provide lots of funny G rated jokes, this movie is filled with G rated humour.Eye candy was non-existent the alternate track with the blonde ""ohh so perfect and nice"" army woman was pathetic, the scene where she Johny pleads her to trust him when shes threatening them with a gun WAS FUNNY AND SAD AT THE SAME TIME (the gun may have as much as stung......................none of them), haha the FF and Silver Surfer threatened with a gun, minutes away from disaster have time for a dialogue scene.And the one fact that triggered the reaction, towards the end I expected a really big showdown between the most powerful character in the comic universe and his equally enigmatic but not quite as powerful servant, what i instead got was a damp squib that was stale enough to be ancient.SO THATS IT???!!! THATS HOW EASY IT IS TO DEFEAT THE MOST Powerful COMIC BOOK CHARACTER EVER.(The mega powerful SS wasn't beaten with much effort either).PROVISIONS FOR SEQUELS AND SPIN-OFFS HAVE BEEN MADE AS EXPECTED, I WILL SHAVE MY HEAD IF THERE Isn't At least ONE MORE FF AND A SILVER SURFER SPIN-OFF.On a positive note Laurence Fishburne did an excellent voice-over of the SS as did Macmohan with Doom.In all another film that just about meets the mark, BUT REALLY EXCELS AS A Children's MOVIE.Ideal for a matinée (any cheaper) show with the family on a Sunday (which is what i did).OR BETTER STILL WATCH ON TV WHEN IT COMES THERE.Watch with sequel considerations, ratings, comic book, current crop of movies in mind.-s NO BIG SCENES, every aspect leaves you with the feeling THATS IT?!!, so so acting, HIDEOUS ALBA, LACKLUSTRE END.+/-s Children's MOVIE.+s short and sweet, doesn't excel but manages to pull through on humour and a few memorable scenes dialogues,meets low expectations,VERY GOOD FAMILY/CHILRENS MOVIE.total 6/10 (factoring in lowered expectations and sequel, once again careful analysis makes the movie go from just good to OK to bad to worse, but when i left except the end leaving a really bad taste the movie was OK and I've stuck to my original rating, gone are the times repeat viewing and careful analysis made the movie better).",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

We see the media circus surrounding Reed Richards and Sue Storm's wedding and this lot were always in the public eye in both comic and cartoon adventures. Introducing the Silver Surfer was a brilliant idea for this film. His powers interfering in the Four's abilities was an interesting twist and provided some real fun and excitement.

While the title highlights the Silver Surfer, the plot in fact still revolves around the two-dimensional issues of the Fantastic Four. As Dr. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic, played by Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (The Invisible Woman, played by Jessica Alba) try to get married in the midst of the hoopla as superhero celebs, the team discovers that they aren't the only super-powered beings in the universe when they come up against the mysterious Silver Surfer and the Earth-threatening Galactus. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/Torch is the only one who lights up the screen with his sizzling screen presence (pardon the pun), and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/Thing is his reliable foil.Julian McMahon (of Nip/Tuck and Charmed fame) reprises his role as the evil Victor Von Doom; it's a pity he did not get more screen time. I have not read the comicbooks, but F4 was different in that unlike other superhero stories, the foursome are open celebrities and lead no secret lives. Yet, they unrealistically squabble about their issues as if they are not used to being on call to save the world at a moment's notice (hello, that's what superheroes do!). Also unlike other such stories, the military/police are not grateful for the Fantastic Four's help and do not seem to collaborate with them, treating the superheroes as brats they have to deal with.Nonetheless, with its general patronage appeal, expect the movie to deliver good, clean fun and passable entertainment.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

145,freaky_dave,Nothing Special but still entertaining,7,15 June 2007,"Fantastic Four Rise of The Silver Surfer wasn't bad. Like its predecessor, it was more of a fun popcorn film. The story was also improved from the first movie, though some of the dialoque was worse.I'm not going to go into plot details because I'm sure most Marvel Comic fans know the story about Galactus and The Silver Surfer from the FF comics back in the sixties titled The Coming of Galactus. Granted there was no Watcher like in those comics, but the origin story of both Galactus and The Silver Surfer was pretty much accurate, with the exception of Sue taking the place of Alicia on a major plot detail. We also have the return of Doctor Doom as well.I'm sure many have seen the previews and trailers for the movie, so it's no spoiler when I say the scenes where Johnny switches powers with the other members of the team aren't as goofy as I thought they would be. In fact it goes hand in hand with the ending, but I won't share those details.Fantastic Four 2 is about on the same par as the first film. With the exception of Chris Evans who has all the good lines again, the acting still seemed off. It's most likely because of the horrendous dialoque. There also was no real chemistry between the Reed and Sue characters, but Ioan Gruffudd was pretty good playing the quirky scientist that is Reed Richards. Mike Chiklis was also somewhat okay, but Jessica Alba still needs to improve her acting.And for those who didn't like the way Galactus was portrayed, I can understand your point, but it wasn't really that bad because Galactus can take on different forms. However, there is a scene in the movie which kind of does give and image of what Galactus looks like in the comics. It is not a clear image, but it is there.On one final note, the ending of Fantastic Four 2 was superior to the ending we got with Spider Man 3, and I found FF 2 more entertaining as well. Maybe it was because of its short 92 minute running time, whereas Spiderman 3 was just too long with too much going on at once.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
146,seawalker,Should have been better,4,17 July 2007,"... Or to give it it's proper title, ""Fantastic Four 2: The Contractual Obligation"".OK. That's very negative. As a superhero movie pitched towards very small children, I suppose that there is nothing wrong with ""4: Rise Of The Silver Surfer"", but really it should have been so much better. I know that a lot of people didn't like the first ""Fantastic Four"" movie very much, but I did (it was big, silly, technicolour fun), and sad to say it, ""4: Rise Of The Silver Surfer"" is nowhere near as good.The great assets of the first film were Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon. The film came alive whenever those actors were on screen. This time round they sleepwalked their way through their roles (I'm sure I saw one of them checking his watch), leaving Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba (very nice to look at, but I hated your hair this time, Darling!) to drown in a plot of bad jokes and semi-romantic mush (both of which I sometimes have a disturbingly high tolerance for, but not this time). The Silver Surfer effects are magnificent, but the least you can expect in a Summer blockbuster are good special effects.Should have been better. Much, much better.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

I was glad that I didn't see it on the big screen because it is a complete time pass film that is average to keep you entertained and is best viewed at home. I did not really like the first Fantastic 4 because of the bad story and no action. This one is quite better but did not live up to my expectation. The Silver Surfer was a good idea for the film and also the powers getting transferred by the human torch, which became useful in the end to defeat Dr Doom on the surfer and it was cool that one of them had all four powers. It was not shown clearly that what happened to Dr Doom? Maybe he will be back for a third instalment.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
148,blrnani,Shame it was the last one in the series,7,20 February 2018,"(because the failed reboot doesn't even count)
I thought this was a very nice sequel to the opening film, which had explained how our heroes gained their strange powers and set the stage for an enduring franchise. So I'm sorry there won't be any more follow ups by this engaging cast, since Chris Evans has become overly identified with the very successful Captain America franchise now. What I don't understand is the hostility of some people towards the film, particularly criticism of the acting by an excellent cast from people weaned on the sort of pap served up on US TV and at Saturday matinees. I could understand it if comic book fans had found glaring differences to the Marvel originals, but as films I think they stand up very well and I'm sure they will be well regarded by posterity. Right now there seem to be far too many people with personal axes to grind, which helps to explain the dire state of the country's political situation.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
149,helmutty,Fantastic Four 2,7,15 June 2007,"You can't compare the first movie to this, the second movie. While, the first Fantastic Four movie shows the introduction or the beginning of their powers and how they live with their superpowers, the second movie is on the action. The story is simple, a strange alien comes to the world and while Johnny chases after the silver sleek alien, he somehow gets to know the name, silver surfer. Silver surfer comes to destroy the world like others bringing Galactus to eat the world up. From there, the Fantastic Four must do something or their world will soon end.It is quite short, somehow like a short movie, but still it can entertain you with excellent fights with special effects which is the most entertaining, the talking about how to destroy or bring the board away from the Silver surfer is quite fast. All they do is action. On the other side, the movie is quite short and hence the fights scenes are quite short. Dr Doom is back and he is more powerful but the movie does not prove that he is powerful, that is why Fantastic Four can't be a short movie, when it is short, it can't prove the Fantastic Four to be more powerful like Dr Doom.Don't let the PG rating affect you, some scenes are a little intense. Either you like the first movie or you like to see Silver surfer in action, you can watch it. Hopefully, we will get an extended version on DVD.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

The Silver Surfer was the harbinger, sent to scout planets for Galactus' energy life supply and sustenance.When Kirby drew him that way, it was for a purpose,it gave him an identity, it was the FF that went head to head, not just the Surfer..But , that being said, Director Tim Story does a fine job, with a good script, could have been better, longer and more fulfilling. Sue and Reed are in love and ready to tie the knot, when , enter the"" Silver Surfer ""! He is preparing the Earth as the next smörgåsbord for Galactus, by creating craters in a certain geometric order around the world, as discovered by Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic(Ian Gruffudd)and also Dr. Doom(Julian McMahon).Enter the U.S. Army who combines forces with the FF and Von Doom, who has since recovered from his last encounter with the FF. And of course., Dr. Doom has his own agenda, getting the surfboard, which has tremendous power, and taking over the world , which is one flaw of the film, because he doesn't realize , Galactus is coming.That would have been a GREAT battle, Dr. Doom vs. Galactus ! Never happened.But ,the emotional bonds between the FF members comes across Strong ,and Heartfelt ! The dangers they face have real consequences, and they are shown. Michael Chiklis is Terrific as the ""Thing"",Kirby 's Thing ! The rest of the cast is fine and they work together very well .Sue Storm/Invisible Girl(Jessica Alba),Johnny Storm/Torch( Chris Evans),Alicia Masters( Kerry Washington),Silver Surfer/Norrin Radd voiced by Larry/Lawrence Fishburne, all are excellent . So, if you want thrills , spills,fantasy, love and a worthy intergalactic battle, this 92 minute film is for you . It really should have been 2 hours. Excellent Special effects .

I heard there where supposed to be a spin-off to Silver Surfer but they canceled it.

The comedy between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm kept the movie on the light-hearted sides, but, like all the other sequels I've seen this summer, the plot has felt like it was FORCED!

Regrettably, the praise for this film stops there. The acting was poor, the plot was jumbled and rather than have a new story with a captivating anti-hero, Rise of the Silver Surfer fell back into the reliably mediocre with Dr. Doom. Not only that, but the logic behind the power transfers, Sue's blatantly obvious neon wig, and a meaningless third act death make this film borderline awful.

154,kevin_crighton,"Finally, a fun summer movie! (plot details mentioned)",6,15 June 2007,"The first Fantastic Four movie was a fun comic book movie, that suffered from being a strictly by the book origin telling. In this one however, having the characters established means they can simply get on with telling the story.The plot is actually simple. A mysterious figure on a silver board is causing havoc around the world and the military call in the Fantastic Four to help. They then discover that the figure is only the START of the problems the world faces.After the overlong three-quels Spider-man 3 and Pirates 3, it's pleasant surprise that we've finally had a summer movie that is funny in places, tells it's story without over-staying it's welcome. The special effects are impressive, the action sequences are not bad. But I have to say that for a summer blockbuster there's not as much action as you'd expect but that does give time to develop the characters, which it does quite well.As far as the actors go, Chris Evans easily walks away with the film. After the 2 Fantastic Four movies and Sunshine I think he could be a huge star in the making. His double act with Michael Chiklis is wonderful. They make the Human Torch and Thing characters you want to spend time with. As for Ioan Gruffudd, he seems more relaxed this time out as Reed Richards, and he does get the best speech in the movie. All I'll say on that, is geeks, your time has come!! Jessica Alba may not be the best actress in the world, but she's better than some critics have said, though the blue contact lenses do take some getting used to. As a group though the charisma and chemistry between them is convincing.However, the stumbling block of the movie are the villains of the piece. First, bringing back Doctor Doom is a mistake. He just seemed to be in there, so the FF have someone they can fight.The Silver Surfer is a let-down too. Not the CGI used to create him, but the use of the character. He's not really developed and doesn't really do that much but yet in the end he has the key role at the end. As for the alien entity Galactus, all we see are these huge clouds in space. I've no idea what the character looks like in the comic books, but I was expecting more.All that being said though, I did enjoy it.

It was a different, better experience this time around, as the Fantasti-car makes its first theater appearance and Dr. Doom returns, even if certain scenes have him looking a little like Emperor Palpatine. It was great to see the Silver Surfer himself, but the film as a whole, sadly did not make much use of all the characters involved. Galactus may have had less than 10 minutes screen-time!A white comet hurtles around the Earth creating craters and causing all sorts of havoc throughout the globe. While Sue and Reed avoid the public eye and ensuing chaos to get married, their dodging tactics and inner turmoil within the group prove all for naught when that very comet crashes the fun. Back in Latveria, Dr. Doom lives and seeks the comet, a Silver Surfer, for his own intent.There's plenty of excitement and action across the globe as the Fantastic Four save lives and duke things out in locales such as London and China. I was also impressed with the Fantasti-Car and with certain special effects, like General Hager's fate and Galactus. The Silver Surfer himself wasn't too bad either, so I hope they use him better the next time around, such as Dr. Doom. The ruler of Latveria certainly came back with a bang for the sequel. Since Galactus did appear though, I hoped they would have used better screen time for one of comics' greatest villains.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
156,arthera09,doug jones is the man,3,17 June 2007,"This movie can be summarized with the sentence Doug Jones is the man. That was the only good thing about the movie. The special effects fight scenes with Doug Jones as the silver surfer were perfect. He maybe the best physical actors out there right now. It is a shame there are no more silent films because that man would own the screen. The rest of the acting was bad and somehow Jessica Alba did not look that good. There was little to no chemistry between cast members. I realized that this goes back to classic Fantastic Four, but the whole point of doing these movies is that we get to modernize them. I don't want them to be so hokey. But the only reason this movie did not get a lower rating was because of Doug Jones. Before we go any further what was up with Galactus. They totally did not address any of that. We understood he was a threat but he was an awesome force to be reckoned with. Silver Surfer just cannot go up and blow himself up and kill Galactus. Number one Galactus gave Silver Surfer his power and he would give him enough to let him KILL Galactus. One just does not kill Galactus like that. It was dumb. But back to the one good thing. Doug Jones was perfect and when he was off the board he was even better. That makes me wish that they do a Silver Surfer movie. Oh yeah the stupid one liners made me want to hurt someone. Stan Lee's cameo was really good but overall the 20 minutes of Silver Surfer was the only cool thing of the movie.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

The second reason is that they always insert some love interest or angle that slows the story down and that I don't care about. I suspect they do this to have a broader appeal to female audiences. As far as I'm concerned, a superhero -male or female- functions a lot better without attachments and personal relationships. This brings us to one of the reasons I found the latest Spiderman and now the Fantastic 4 annoying. It's like to me, these guys are forced to play house and deal with silly jealousies and domestic issues when more pressing things in the form of the fate of the world is at stake. Frankly, all this nonsense seriously cut into my ""kickass-time"".Okay. I'm glad I got that off my chest. Now to the Fantastic 4 commentary: This movie is not spectacular. However,in my opinion, it is a decent ""TV-level"" movie not suited for theatrical release. 2 reasons: tickets are expensive and audiences want to be blown away; this is especially true when they go to see a FX or ""special effects"" movie. They want to see something awesome, jaw-dropping, and in-your-face on the big screen. Not some guy surfing around 2 people and their wedding plans.

Reed Richards (Ioan Grufford) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) make plans to get married, but are interrupted when the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones/Laurence Fishburne) shows up, trying to destroy the earth and it's up to the fantastic four to deal with him, as well as with the return of Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon).Let me start off by saying that I was never that big a fan of the FF comics (More Batman and Spiderman). I liked the powers and all, and they had some good stories, but they always struck me as the Brady Bunch of the Marvel universe, so squeaky clean and loved by all. And Marvel was always at their hokiest when they tried to get into science. And dear god, WHY did Dr. Doom always narrate his actions in the third person? Still, I liked 2005's ""Fantastic Four"" film, which was stomped on the throat by just about everyone (This one has been as well). Not serious enough. Alba couldn't act. Dr. Doom wasn't Darth Vader blah blah blah. That film was a brainlessly fun piece of fluff and so was this one. Everyone's been spoiled by the Batman Begins masterpiece.Let me start with the performances. Grufford is somewhat subdued as Richards, though he gets to show some spunk and initiative this time around. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis have a great little repartee together as The Human Torch and The Thing respectively. Alba has gotten better than last time. She's still not what I'd call an actress, but she's not bad. She doesn't whine or detract from anything and has some funny moments. And I didn't give a crap about how bleached blonde she was. The powers all look good but with a few cheap-looking glitches with Mr. Fantastic. The Surfer looks fantastic but I do wish Doug Jones had gotten to voice-over instead of Fishburne because aside from a few sad looks and gestures they could've had anyone under all that CGI. Don't get me wrong, I like Fishburne and he speaks well without getting too melodramatic, but I love Doug Jones' stuff.The opening 10 minutes of the movie are pretty weak, but it gets much better with the wedding and the Surfer/Torch chase that I'm sure everyone's seen by now with the trailers and all, but it's somehow been given more intensity and fine polish for the film. There are several other action sequences and the movie offers up decent action for a PG film, as well as a particularly cool way to off someone, but I want more. I feel like they used a bunch of the action up in the trailers and TV spots, but there's still loads of cool bits of CGI and whatnot. It's all great turn-your-brain-off stuff. The jokes are well played, but the film lacks a little for seriousness. And I wish Julian McMahon had been given more evil crap to do, cause I like his stuff. There were very few moments where I wasn't enjoying the film.Galactus was a small disappointment, not because he wasn't true to the original comics (which he was). I know there are a huge legion of fanboys livid about that, but I don't think they'd be too happy about a 70 story tall guy in purple Viking armor either. The problem with him/it was there was a certain feeling of awe and magnitude lacking in his arrival. He was also dispatched too easily, which makes me feel that there was no good way to end the movie in a very satisfying way, cause the way the comic ended sucked too.It's a fun movie that you have to turn your brain off to enjoy, because there are stretches of ""scientific"" crap (like the comics) that make you go ""Huh? a pulse what?"" It's not art, and the movie gleefully acknowledges this and still makes you have a good time. It's fun, it's funny, and it's light-hearted. a C+",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Similar to numerous people who adore CGI, read the comic books when they were kids and thought the first installment was decent enough to justify a sequel, I was more than willing to get myself ready to be overwhelmed by the mere strength of the eye candy and CGI effects within the film. And then I watched it at a special press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel. To make a long story short, FF2 is not a bad film. I was actually quite entertained throughout wide parts of the film (particularly at the beginning - but more on that later). Problem was, once I stepped out of the theater, I couldn't actually recall anything specific or special about what I have just seen (other than that cool CGI Silver Surfer, that is). It was just so mediocre in terms of plot, direction and acting (somebody really ought to give Jessica Alba some acting lessons a.s.a.p), that I didn't even care enough to remember it. Furthermore, while the original film required some suspension of disbelief, let's just say the plot in its sequel stretches this boundary one step too far, IMO. As I've already mentioned, FF2 actually starts up in quite a promising manner. While Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue (Alba) get ready for their media circus wedding (think Tomkat style - but bigger), strange electronic and climatic disturbances occur across the globe. From here on out, you have this huge build up that pays off about half an hour into the film, continues with a bang and some dazzling CGI shots, and suddenly ends abruptly while the initial novelty of the Silver Surfer's appearance wears off. As usual, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm steals the show as the only character to truly evolve during this film, Mike Chiklis as Ben is seriously under-used, my 1.5 year-old nephew could play better than Gruffud's Reed and Alba isn't even that pretty anymore. Then you have all these villains (Silver Surfer is definitely not working alone, as implied in the IMDb official plot line) and some twists and turns that leave you feeling mildly entertained, but also incredibly under whelmed. You see, if you're looking for mindless big-budget fun, this is the place for you and your bucket of popcorn. However, don't expect to find the heart of Spider-Man 3 or epic feel of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Don't even look for credible acting or intelligent plot. Only decent thing you'll find are some good looking money shots, and mindless action sequences.

""The Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is merely the second in a series, following 2005's original that introduced moviegoers to Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffold), The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), her brother The Human Torch (Chris Evans), and The Thing (Michael Chiklis). (Audio review here.) The story in this follow-up is basic superhero stuff, picking up not too long after the last one ended. Mr. Fantastic is getting ready to wed The Invisible Woman, then bad things happen, and The Fantastic Four are called upon to remedy the problem, which involves the Silver Surfer destroying the planet and Dr. Von Doom doing whatever it is he does.From there the heroes do their hero thing, which is accompanied by just enough side story to form slightly rounded characters and plot. Like its predecessor and the comic books on which they both are based, ""Silver Surfer"" is a different breed of superhero movie, one that varies in tone and content from recent renditions of more popular heroes like Batman, Superman, and Spider-man. With its multiple lead characters, ""Silver Surfer"" occasionally reminds of the X-Men flicks, but does not match the gravity present in those movies or other recent hits featuring the aforementioned main characters. Those are serious, more intense movies that can create wonderful cinematic experiences that feel more ""real"". Not that any of these kinds of movies are truly real, but both of the Fantastic Four movies have a more cartoon-ish feel that distances them from reality.This is both a blessing and a curse. On the downside, ""Silver Surfer"" does not have the emotional attachment that other superhero pictures have or at least desire, which limits the scope of the movie's power. A surprising side effect is the everyday levity that is provided. If you and your buddies had bizarre superpowers, wouldn't you frequently be making fun of each other's gifts and using your own for not entirely kosher reasons? Movies with solo protagonists are rarely able to capture such interactions, but with its tight-knit lead characters, Surfer can and does, with degrees of success that vary like most attempts at humor, from clever and hilarious to flat and unfunny. Nothing is brilliant or profound, everything just creates a casual surface relationship between movie and viewer.The minimal depth also allows for a streamlined hour and a half movie that has cursory side stories, unexplainable technology, and vague villainous motives, all of which is completely fine, if not preferable. Just as popcorn should not be loaded with substantive fruits and vegetables, popcorn movies like this one should not be loaded down with messages and complications that don't enhance the story.The shallow story and characters possessing only one or two dimensions means that the movie never has much chance of succeeding on multiple levels, so if you expect a serious action movie, you will be disappointed with ""Rise of Silver Surfer"", as you likely were with the original. If you expect mindless superhero entertainment and a near carbon copy of the first installment, then you will leave the theater content with what you saw.Bottom Line: There is a place for movies like this: DVD rental. 5 of 10.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
161,caseynicholson,Grossly Under-Rated,9,13 August 2015,"I just watched this movie on Blu-Ray, and it was the first time I'd seen it since viewing it in the theater during its 2007 release. Then and now I found this movie to be much better than the reviews and reception it received. The only thing I can figure is that in 2007 people were just beginning to grow tired of the first wave of superhero movies. The movie is a bit hokey--but that is in staying true to its source material. As in the original film, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" features a ""Thing"" costume that could have been a bit better done, and an actor playing Mr. Fantastic who doesn't look a whole lot like the Reed Richards of the comic books. But the movie features a dynamic and fun plot, a well-paced storyline, extraordinary effects, and an altogether good movie experience. That being the case, I'm going to give this film 9/10 stars, after having given its predecessor 8/10. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is actually one of the better comic book adaptations that I've seen--yes, MCU movies included. Galactus is neat (even if a complete reimagining of the comic character), the Silver Surfer storyline is neat, Doom's return is neat. It's just a neat movie all in all! If you haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a while, give it a shot.

This had all the qualities of a C-grade parody made over a drunken weekend except it isnt a parody and they spend a lot of time and money making it. I am officially adding the director and writers to my $*it list.How bad is it? Oh look a helicopter tail & propeller are moving towards me slowly... I think I will scream for help instead of... you know... moving. Also we can now talk in vacuum of space, the Arabs are actually white dudes in robes, abilities get switched just so Alba can get naked, and half the movie is a wedding comedy, minus the comedy.No redeeming qualities to this. All writers and directors need to be banned from making movies, actors should be quarantined for 10 years to re-evaluate their lives, and the fantastic four comics need to be canceled (they were always terrible anyway).",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

And honestly the same complaints and complements:
CGi took me out at point, but improved slightly, and it feels like not much happens, but at least it's more memorable.
Then we have Chiklis and Evans who are still amazing with both their characters and adding on a new character: The Silver Surfer, who feels lifeless yet still interesting enough to entertain.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
164,Paynebyname,"Enjoyable, entertaining fun",7,18 June 2007,"I saw the film last night and really enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the first one.Obviously after reading so many other reviews of a weak script etc I must be brain dead but I liked the story and the characters. The four main characters are likable, do actually work together as a proper team and aren't constantly bemoaning their lot in life and the curse of their superpowers.I found the humour entertaining, I loved the scene where Reed stood up to the major and defended his nerdiness. Being freed from the over wrought drama and continual 'damsel in distress' bullshit that fills the spiderman series makes this a considerably more enjoyable experience.I've not read the comics so I can't comment on the Galactus representation issue but as a newbie I found it worked. I also like the issues of sacrifice and bravery that the film used, particularly in the satisfying final action scene.Films, especially comic book ones, are meant to be visually entertaining and it more than delivered on this. Great action sequences, cool characters and good ideas.On a final note what is happening to Stan Lee's ego? Can't he see the damaging impact that his woefully lame and intrusive cameos have on the flow of his movies.www.paynebyname.co,",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

It was a straight, coherent story, with its tongue firmly in it's cheek, and it didn't over-complicate things with too many characters or too many plot turns.ROTSS knows exactly what it is - a simple, special effects driven, comic book panel - and sticks to its guns. It's dumb fun, fast and pretty, and it never gets much deeper than that. But in all honesty, what else are you looking for in a superhero summer blockbuster? I thought it hit the mark perfectly and I found it made for a thoroughly enjoyable night at the movies.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
167,samseescinema,a harmless dry heave of a sequel,4,20 June 2007,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer Reviewed by Samuel OsbornIt's sad enough when a sequel fails to live up to the quality of its predecessor. But it's an entirely different tragedy when the predecessor, in this case the first Fantastic Four movie, contained no hint of quality to begin with. Its sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer, is not just unnecessary, but achieves a woeful demotion from the comic book regurgitation of the original. That's right, it's even worse.Besides the obvious financial potential of a Fantastic Four sequel, the only plausible reason for Rise of the Silver Surfer to be granted the greenlight by its studio is by way of its title character. The Silver Surfer (voiced occasionally by Laurence Fishburne) is admittedly pretty awesome. He careens from outer space as a meteor into Earth's atmosphere, zipping around the globe and impacting the land with various craters in preparation for the planet's destruction. Never mind his humane intentions and fluffy nice guy interior; the Silver Surfer is a certifiable badass. Composed entirely of candied CGI goodness, he looks like the figurine version of Terminator 2's metallic T-1000 propped up on a chrome surfboard. His sequences are the only fantastic thing about this film, making his supreme lack of appearances all the more disappointing. Instead, we're given the likes of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who still leads the contest for most stupidly overwrought name for a villain. Von Doom soaks up screen time like a diseased sponge, blocking out any opportunity for the Silver Surfer to perform his titular rise.Returning to save the world from interplanetary surfers are the aforementioned four. Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) again leads the spandexed quartet, now mysteriously engaged to Jessica Alba, playing Sue Storm. Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans return as the big orange rock, Ben Grimm, and the cocky flamer, Johnny Storm. Each actor's performance lives up to the mediocrity of the first Fantastic go-round, with the exception of Michael Chiklis whose delivery has become as lifeless as the rocks he's composed of. Ms. Alba also loses some of her conviction, which probably is just an effect of the difficulty involved in manipulating a face lathered in entire bottles of golden bronzing. Anyway, the ride isn't very lengthy at a cool 89 minutes and thus can't irritate to its full potential. It's a harmless dry heave of a sequel, amazing sometimes in its technical prowess and also amazing in its complete ineptitude for telling a story. I'd make a sly finishing pun about how un-fantastic Rise of the Silver Surfer is, but I'm sure by now the point is made. This film is bad. Samuel Osborn",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

However, finding the Silver surfer appealing, I bought the DVD and gave it a try. What a big mistake. This film not only got all the stupid clichés you could think of, but the only character I thought would be interesting (The Silver Surfer) was reduced to a silly persona relating some sort of amoeba with god-like powers. Special effects apart, there's nothing to save from this film. There are people out there who want us to still believe that good special effects are enough to justify millions of dollars in expenses and a horrible plot. Michael Bay and company, please, take a $10000 budget and let's see if you can actually come up with a good film.

There's lots of unanswered questions of course, like where did the Silver Surfer come from? What was the deal with Dr. Doom, did he just splash in the river and the writers forgot about him? What was this ""evil""? I almost lost my lunch when I heard such original lines like ""I'd rather spend my last hours just holding Alicia."".....acckkk! Someone wipe all this sap off my shoes. There's no chemistry between Reed and Sue and her pasty fake blonde hair got really annoying. And am I the only one that could have predicted Johnny's romance from a mile away?

171,MovieZoo,Silver Surfer Surfs to Stardom while the Fantastic 4 Flounders,5,15 June 2007,"Initially, I was going to wait for a week so sincere reviewers would get a chance to write this one up. I became so tired of the fake reviews which were written with ulterior motives. But, I caved in, anxious to see the new, improved version of The Fantastic Four. I came out ""not impressed"" but grateful it was not as bad as the first.First, the good stuff: the characters individually and independently were better, Silver surfer was a very good character, the special FX were better, the action and movie as a whole was definitely geared towards satisfying the young and family oriented movie goers, and the humor was sometimes better.I still do not get anything out of the relationships for the most part. It feels like there is just no connection between the characters. Reed and Sue getting married? Why? They are no more in love with each other than The Thing and Human Torch. Adding to this bland relationship tragedy is the horrible dialogue which is just as bland. Dialogues come across more like announcements than engaging conversation. While I managed a couple chuckles, the humor seemed forced and cheap. I found nothing funny in scenes where devastation surrounds mankind but time is taken for the F4 to ignore the crowd around them while they make a wisecrack or two. Superhero action seemed to be inserted as an after thought sometimes. Why does it seem there is always a crowd around when you don't need one?Not only was camera work stiff, it was almost like flashing snapshots on the screen a lot of the time. And why do they always have to stop to have a discussion while fighting evil. Is Tim Story telling us that his viewers are too stupid to follow a conversation on the move? Believe me, I got bored watching action stalled out for the sake of one-liners.Speaking of one-liners, here's one for you, the background music seldom matched what was on-screen. And I am sure the gun fire sounding like muffled firecrackers was not a problem at the theater. I do not know if it is Story's fault or 20th Century Fox's that this movie still does not make The Fantastic Four as fantastic as they deserve to be. I only know that because one failed, they both failed. Both should remove themselves from Superhero movie-making.Like I said, I was not impressed but thankful it was slightly better. I struggled to give it a 5 out of 10. No thanks to Doom who did nothing much at all.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
172,bburns,Less than Fantastic,5,8 August 2007,"I am the only person I know over the age of 10 who liked the first Fantastic Four, so I went into the film with an open mind. After all, it has some of my favorite actors: Andre Braugher, Michael Chiklis, Laurence Fishburne, Julian McMahon and Kerry Washington. And although the first one was kind of silly, it was at least as good as the first ""X-Men"" and more fun than ""The Incredible Hulk"". Unfortunately, this film is even dumber than the original and plenty boring.It starts off with the impending nuptials of Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) coming right when the Four are recruited by General Hager (Braugher playing an idiot for the first time in his career) to stop an intergalactic force that has wiped out life on all other planets that it has come into contact with. It is always heralded by the Silver Surfer (Fishburne). The Surfer comes to Earth right when Reed (aka Mr. Fantastic) and Sue (aka The Invisible Girl) are set to take their vows. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) is sent to chase after the Surfer, but the Surfer wins their fight and gives Johnny the ability to switch powers with anyone he touches. Later on, the Surfer visits Latveria and attacks Dr. Victor Von Doom (McMahon). The attack heals Dr. Doom's scars, but leaves his superpowers alone. And so Gen. Hager, the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom team up to fight the Surfer before the Earth is destroyed.Aside from the inherent stupidity of the plot, I didn't care for Fishburne's performance, nor the fact that he's an English-speaking alien named ""Gordon"" with a girlfriend named ""Alicia"" (in the comics, his name was ""Norrin"", so perhaps this is a tribute to ""ALF""?). I also had a problem with Johnny (aka The Human Torch) and Ben Grimm (Chiklis) acting like spoiled children when Reed and Sue consider splitting off from the Four to have a normal marriage. I was unhappy that Kerry Washington--so good in ""Ray"" and ""The Last King of Scotland""--was given nothing to do except stare into space and tell Sue how much she loves Ben (aka The Thing). The fact that all of these great actors are stuck with such bad dialog is depressing. And I can't be the only movie-goer weary of Stan Lee's cameos.On the other hand, the CGI effects--while sub-LOTR--still look pretty cool. And Andre Braugher gives his all to a bad role that most actors would have sleepwalked through.But overall, this a bad film, not worth the time or talent that these otherwise gifted actors bring. I hope that Braugher, Chiklis, Fishburne, McMahon and Washington work together again, but just not for ""Fantastic Four 3"". 5 out of 10.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
173,tomrito,Good Summer fun,9,19 June 2007,"This movie was a lot of fun; it develops each of the characters nicely and keeps you entertained with its humor and human interaction. Although that is not always a great thing for a comic book movie, it plays true to the FF comics in that they were always a little different from the rest, more story line and less pure bash and bang. The Silver Surfer was great and could have had a larger part, but I will take what I can get. The part of Galactus wasn't great but even in the comics I always though he was a little campy for a destroyer of worlds. We do get to see the human torch mature a little and we also get to see the FF having to fight like a team in order to save the day. However, the real reason I am writing this is because I cannot believe all the Stan Lee bashing on this site. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but Mr. Stan Lee has more class, intelligence and creativity in his little finger then all of you coarse hermaphrodite, pseudo-comic-book-experts put together. To berate the man who has given us all these great charters and has fascinated generations of readers, is just plain dumb.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
174,simonparker1990,Rises High Above the Original,9,15 June 2007,"Fantastic Four was a movie I had very mixed feelings about. As I have never read a single Fantastic Four comment I couldn't complain about the storyline being different, or certain character be interpreted in the wrong way, no the reason I had mixed feelings about it was the fact it was poorly made. There is no doubt in my mind that had someone like Sam Raimi or Christopher Nolan been given the directors job they could have made a better movie. However, could they have given it the fun, energetic tone that the story requires. Honestly I don't think they could have done. For all its faults the original movie was fun, it was poorly written and the characters poorly visualised, but the movie itself was fun, and I still had high hopes for the series. I was very much looking forward to Rise of the Silver Surfer. The trailers were brilliant, the storyline sounded interesting, and the fact that the origin storyline was out the way is always a good thing. So does it surpass the original? Does it live up to my expectations? Yes on both accounts. Rise of the Silver Surfer is a success, it still is flawed on many ways. But the movie is a lot better than the original and the fun tone has improved greatly. The performances seem to have improved, the storyline actually exists here, and the special effects for the surfer are spectacular. Its surprised me that the best comic book movie of 2007 so far has actually been this, not hard really when you see that Giost Rider was an unmitigated disaster, and Spiderman 3 was overlong and dull.Anyway, the cast here seem to have settled in nicely to their roles. I had a major problem with Ioan Gruffudd in the original, a shame as I know he is a talented actor. I just didn't feel he had much to work with. Thankfully his character has improved here, he seems a lot more likable, his performance less strained, and his dialogue at times really works. I also found his action sequences didn't feel as lame as they did in the original. Jessica Alba has thankfully improved, she is now average in this series with a few bright spots along the way. I still believe a more talented actress is required for her role, but in some scenes, such as the very well executed wedding sequence, her character and performance worked very well. But of course, like the original, two actors dominate this movie. Michael Chiklis as The Thing, and Chris Evans as The Human Torch. I think I liked the fact that The Thing is used more often for comic relief, it suited the character more, and he has some really great comedic moments. Chris Evans has also improved, he was very funny in the original and had great charisma, here he shows some emotional weight on a few sequences, but generally he's the same guy. Julian McMahon's performance for me was an improvement on the original. He's definitely decided to be a pantomime villain, which this time very much works. Special credits must also go to Doug Jones, who as the surfer, gives him the grace required. Laruence Fishbourne's voice also is perfect for the surfer.So what of the big action sequences? Well the action here works a hell of a lot better. The original suffered quite a lot because apart from two decent scraps, we really didn't see the Fantastic Four being fantastic. Here we see them doing a lot more action, and we also see them do a fair bit of globe trotting, which in my opinion highly benefits the storyline. The much advertised sequence of the Human Torch and Surfer chase looks amazing, but is nothing compared to what follows. We have a well executed sequence in London, a great bit in Shanghai, and various other little fights along the way. All of them look pretty impressive. However, some of the effects do look very naff. Which leads to me to one of the films flaws. The effects for Reed, and even at times the Human Torch, looked pretty naff. Annoying as the surfer looks so brilliant that whenever you compare the effects together it always makes the bad effects look even worse. The action also has a more intense feeling that the first movie lacked, the Shanghai and very final bit (won't spoil it) definitely feels a lot more epic than anything the original dared to attempt. This new found style, added with the entertaining factor from the original, makes the movie a vaster improvement, and makes the Fantastic Four definitely a franchise I'd be happy to return to in the future. The storyline here has improved a great deal, the threat seems a lot better, the off screen Galaktus is a great villain and we never see him. But this is the surfers movies and the fantastic fours movie. I liked the family dynamic still being front and centre, and also the fact the cheesy humour is no longer intolerable makes the movie a great experience. Of course there are flaws, Jessica Alba's still mediocre performance and the special effects definitely being the main two. But also the script still needs a bit of polishing here and there. But all this is overshadowed by a generally good cast and a great sense of fun. The fact the movie doesn't feel overly long, but never too short, is always a good thing. Rise of the Silver Surfer definitely has given life back to a series that could have flagged badly if this movie was a failure. This will undoubtedly be one of the highlights of the summer, and will definitely entertain all kids of all ages.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
175,Animus,Worse than the First,2,21 March 2008,"Just watched this again and it's worse than I previously believed. Johnny has lost maturity in the sequel rather than gain it, and when his character started as an overgrown teenager thats bad. Sue has become less interesting since she seems to be there for the sole purpose of getting the Alba drool-monkeys in the theater. Reed is more of a nerd and less of a man than in the first, and he was a wuss to begin with. Ben, well he's the only one of the four who seems to be stable. Doom is back, if any one is surprised they must never have heard of the F.F. As before hes a far more interesting than the heroes, but not by much. The Surfer is well, lame. He's a bit too quick to turn on his master and I can't believe Galactus became a space cloud. I could have written a better adaptation in about 5 minutes. Special effects, yeah they are mostly good ones. But thats really the only thing this movie has going for it. Don't pay real money to see this.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
176,Sparrowmaniac,Silver Surfer Rules !!!,7,1 July 2007,"Being the first sequel of this year which has a chance to improve upon the box office records of its successor, Silver Surfer casts a cosmic charm on the big screen. Rise of the Silver surfer improvises on the original movie, it starts off with the impending wedding of Susan Storm and Reed Richards. We find a deepening relationship amongst them.There is a lot of chemistry amongst the four super heroes. Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm who cannot tolerate each other, overcome odds and become great buddies towards the end. We see a new side to Johnny Storm, The human torch. He is still the one to deliver the comic lines, but with a twist of events, he becomes the person responsible leading to missions getting haywire. Its a serious side to his character. Reed Richards, Mr.Fantastic becomes the character he truly is, he leaves the scientist bit, and becomes the leader of the Fantastic Four.If the first movie was focused on The Thing, then this one is based on the Human Torch. Unlike the first movie where he gets any girl to his liking, in this sequel he is vexed with an army vixen who doesn't spare a moment with him. There is a return of Von Doom, who becomes evil personified with the help of the Surfer's board.But truly unique is the character of the Surfer. He has feelings for Susan, because she reminds him of his loved one from his faraway planet. His mission is to make ready a planet for destruction. He becomes the tragic hero, the bidder of evil deeds, left with no choice. But his character is truly enigmatic, he is the all powerful being when conjoint with the board. He feeds on cosmic energy which is why practically speaking he cannot be killed or destroyed. His powers are immense. He can consume a missile, without scratching himself.The special effects are a whole lot better than the previous movie. The final sequence when the Four combine to give their powers to Johnny to destroy Von Doom. Then the initial chase sequence between the Human Torch and the Surfer is also mind blowing. the Fantastic Four vehicle sequence is also pretty neat.All in all a fair watch, mildly entertaining and good to keep your mind off from work for 2 hours.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
177,mcsheehey,Fantastic Fun!,8,19 June 2007,"When the first ""Spiderman"" film was released, it received general approval but some negative reviews,due especially to uneven effects, amateur acting, and cheesy design. However, out of the rubble emerged ""spiderman 2,"" a film that remains as one of the best super-hero adaptations of all time. It far surpassed the original, learning from its mistakes and cleaning up some of the cheesiness. When ""Fantastic Four"" was released, it was met mainly with disapproval and rather bad reviews, which it deserved. The effects were very cheesy, the villain was third-rate, the plot was ridiculous, the script was horrid, and the film dragged on. Luckily, ""Silver Surfer"" has pulled a ""Spiderman 2"" on us. Though not as good as ""Spiderman 2,"" it far surpasses the level of the original.The acting in ""Silver Surfer"" is far from perfect, but it's certainly passable and is extraordinarily unimportant in the film. Chris Evans brings the spirit of fun to the film, Jessica Alba brings the ""hot"" factor, and the silver surfer brings the excitement and bewilderment. The special effects in the film are dazzling and not at all hokey. The silver surfer looks amazing, the human torch looks the way he should, and Galactus, though hardcore fans of the comics may be enormously disappointed, has been stripped of the cheesiness he had in the comics. He's no longer a giant man in purple, but rather an astrological whirlwind of power. The plot of this sequel is also very good. The run time of the picture is short, so the script is beneficially tight and the plot doesn't get old. Also, there is no room for cheesy sub-plots. This is a great, fun movie that people of all ages will enjoy.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
178,moimoichan6,"Not so Fantastic, it makes me wanna move to Latveria.",3,29 August 2007,"I've never been a huge fan of the FF, but there were at least two things I liked in the Comic-Book, and the movie ruined them both.First thing I liked was the excessive graphic imagination that Jack Kirby showed in the comic, with its incredible and gigantic creatures (year, Galactus !) from space or its amazing and futuristic weapons (wooh : the supreme Annihilator !). And in my opinion, the movie is way to shy on that matter. OK, some things are missing to avoid a ridiculous transcription of the comic, but here, there's almost nothing left. No creativity, no originality : everything is small, predictable, and empty. OK, Johnny Storm gets the powers of a super-Skrull, but hey, it's not The Watcher ! And what about the Surfer ? If he's impressive in the trailer (best scene of the movie, of course) he's inexistent in the movie - and the same goes for Doom, and, well, every single character. The second thing that the movie misses is the spirit of the Fantastic Four. The interrogations of Red Richard and Jane to leave the group in order to raise a normal family could have been interesting if it wasn't absolutely a betrayal of the comic. The Fantastics ARE a family, and they're trying to act like one with their powers : that's the all point of the comic : how to deal with your family and use your own abilities. There's no point for them to wonder how to become normal, in order to have a family !

But it is OK to simply like something and F4 was something I liked.BUT nevertheless I was hoping that RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER would approach the excellence of BATMAN BEGINS, the X-MEN movies and all 3 SPIDEYS.It didn't.The Surfer is very cool to watch but is the ONLY reason to catch this new F4. Whatever misgivings you had about miscasting the F4 are glaringly apparent more than ever here. Jessica Alba is simply not Susan Storm (anymore than she is Nancy in SIN CITY). The guy who plays Dr. Doom should simply come with his own cue cards to flash on the screen to tell the audience what to feel.This is great stuff for 8 year olds!

180,elliott78212,WOW!!! Can You Say Sequel Can You Say Thumbs Up,7,27 June 2007,"This is the best sequel I have seen all so far this summer, takes up right were first left off. Focuses on Mr. Fantastic, & Sue, where as the first focused on Viktor, Johnny & The Thing (by the way buy the extended version of first film before going out to see the sequel not that it's relative but it's a better movie with just a few added scenes, very cool) Norrin Radd was better than I expected, special FX top notch, just enough action, FX, and character development kept the movie moving at a nice pace with a slightly slow start which actually helps the film build in excitement. The return of Doom was well handled even if they played up the clichéd bad guy trusted by army military nuts over intelligent non-aggressive typical scenario it plays well in the movie and Reed grows some gonads in a very funny tet-a-tet with a Colonel who learns to late he should have listened.I loved it and can't wait for the next one...a perfect tweener for a trilogy.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

182,lee_a_scott,It's...OK.,6,21 July 2007,"It's been a disappointing summer for sequels so far (Spidey 3 was poor, Pirates 3 was a little unsteady) and FF2 carried on the trend in some ways, but was probably the best blockbuster of the summer so far. Not that that is saying a great deal, given the level of competition. Basically, if you've seen and at any level enjoyed the first movie outing of Marvel's First Family, then you should see and enjoy this one (I didand did!) and if you didn't see it or did and thought it was lame then save yourself whatever the cost of seeing it may be. Like the first film, this has been harshly reviewed and has lots to enjoy  and stuff that will just annoy! It has more of the good (Johnny Storm), more of the unconvincing (she may be pretty, but I'm just not buying Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, and she's so obviously not a blonde), more of the poor (Ben Grimm) and more of the pretty good but ultimately a bit disappointing (Norrin Radd).

This film is just bad. It starts off with the clichéd doomed marriage and progresses through a mire of bad acting, unlikable characters, a stupid plot and a terrible script to what has to be one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The original was unbelievable, but in superhero films that's OK, but there should be a certain degree of reality, and here there is nothing. The characters were just unlikable to the point where I just didn't care about them, and don't even get me started on the acting. The only plus was the impressive special effects, but to be honest there is no other reason to watch this film.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
185,FilmFan777,'Bomb-Bastic' ... Shame too.,5,16 June 2007,"What is wrong here? You'd think the director and writer second time around would get better right? Yea, you'd think but no such luck. Tim Story directed this thing like a newbie while both writers could'not seem to shake corny near senseless dribble. If I was Exec Prod, I'd be one ticked off guy for spending more than 130 million on this. Hell, for 10 million and real talent they could have done so much better.I never felt taken away by this film in any way. No drama, sense of danger or urgency, even from the actors. Like eating spicy buffalo wings made of pink flavored bubble gum. Simply the whole film was a paper tiger of itself.The best about this film... Every scene with the Silver Surfer and the magnetic Dr. Doom, Julian McMahon, whom was used far too less, made you feel like you were took along for the ride. They're the only charismatic, interesting and professional energies in this film.Some effects, like in most fight, Surfer and earthly scenes were pretty impressive. However in the corny, ""oh, let me stretch over here to get those papers"" scenes, it looked like Barney Budget scale. And the unfunny cliché after cliché was embarrassing and frustrating.And what's up with Alba's distractingly fake colored Lil Kim contacts? I mean, every time she was on screen, you'd have to fight being distracted from what's going on.Or Mr. Fantastics gray hair changing density and shape with most every shot.That the larger than life 'Thing' Ben Grimm is seemingly reduced to a pint size butterball party favor.The interaction and perception of our hero's with the general public is tapered down like a cheap parlor trick leaving no sense of drama or superiority.Ioan Gruffudd's acting was wimpy and stylized by director Tim Story as if he was in a day time soap opera.Too bad the great possibilities for one of the best comic groups ever thought of, were laid to rest on such an incompetent team that possibly could have ruined it's chances forever.I would have enjoyed myself better watching the animated series from decades ago.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
186,TimBoHannon,What Should be a Run Turns into a Sprint,3,12 July 2007,"I was admittedly not optimistic when I heard that the runtime of the new Fantastic Four movie is a mere 92 minutes. The inclusion of the Silver Surfer means that Galactus, the omnipotent planet eater, will also appear. Their story is long and complicated, with a hoard of powers, rules, subtleties and motivations. It would probably take a three-hour movie to cover the arc without rushing. Even a two-hour affair would have to make cuts, but at ninety minutes there is no hope for an adequate treatment. Galactus is nearly omitted from the movie, and Marvel Comics fans expecting to see the most powerful being in the universe will be resoundingly disappointed.I took part in a play called 15-minute Hamlet as a drama student in High School. While ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is not so extreme, it races to finish itself as if running for the pole at a NASCAR event. Some James Bond fans dislike ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" because, they assert, it moves too quickly, yet it is a two hour movie. I slammed ""Total Recall,"" for over killing its premise to the point of boredom, but even that film is 113 minutes long. High velocity is fine for the Silver Surfer, but his movie should be deliberate, not supersonic, to justly tell its story.As Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) prepare for their wedding, several meteors slam into Earth creating environmental anomalies such as frozen lakes and power outages. In marches General Hager (Andre Brauger) who begrudgingly asks Richards for help. Reed soon ascertains that the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne) is responsible and he and his team endeavor to find him and solve the mystery.The situation complicates when Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch (Chris Evans), has his molecules disrupted by touching the Surfer. Then there is the matter is Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), the all-metal villain from the first film. A diligent workman is shown chiseling his petrified body. The Fantastic Four defeated him by rapidly heating then cooling his body, so cracking of his inner parts is the problem, not a hard layer. What a circular saw can do for that problem is a question the movie prefers not to answer. General Hager also recruits Doom, but Reed's warning that Doom is not trustworthy is soon proved right.There are more dramas, including Reed and Sue questioning their future plans. The one and only problem with the film is its minimal treatment of all its content. Neither the plot nor the conflicts contain any inherent errors, and just ten more minutes of movie would help them greatly. Despite Galactus' near omission, enough material exists to cover another half hour.The acting is sadly not as inspired as it was in the first film, where the chemistry among the leads made the whole operation work; only Kerry Washington is as good as before. Alba, Evans and Chiklis are all comfortable in their roles, but lack the same gusto I saw in 2005. The Surfer barely speaks; Fishburne could have recorded his voiceovers on his lunch break.The minor roles, however, are horrendous. I hated Andre Braugher in ""Frequency"" and hate him here too. He has one acting approach: frown, droop his cheeks, and say his lines with no expression or dynamic. His army colleagues are equally boring. One of Hager's top aides is Johnny's latest target for flirting, but their chemistry is so cold it could freeze Han Solo all over again. ""Fantastic Four"" was filled with clever uses of the teams' powers, but the new movie is bereft of such ideas, except when Johnny beats up Doom in the climax. ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" does not treat itself with enough respect to rank higher than a four out of ten.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Can someone please explain to me, what so many people see in her? Why is she so popular? Her performance in this film is just laughable. She seriously can't be taken seriously as an actress. "" Why are you trying to destroy us?"" ""Look, I'm trying to help you. But in order for me to do that, you need to tell me the truth. Please!"" Then there is the plastic faced actor Julian McMahon.

188,raymond_chandler,"Far Better Than FF 1, ""Rise"" Stays True to the Spirit of the Comics",7,18 June 2007,"When I was very young, my Mom bought my comics when she did the weekly grocery shopping. One day, mixed in with ""The Flash"", ""Superman"", ""World's Finest"", and ""Action Comics"", was this weird thing called ""Fantastic Four"" # 35. She somehow bought it by mistake, and it changed my life. The Kirby art, the bickering between the heroes, the romance between Reed and Sue...I had never read anything like it in DC. A few months later, I was making my own weekly trips to the local drugstore, buying Spider-man, FF, and Sgt. Fury off the spinner rack for 12 cents each. Slowly, Supes and Batman faded away for me, they just could not compete with the Marvel stories.Fast forward: we live in a post-Image Comics age. Fanboys raised on steroid freaks and chicks in thongs. Yet, somehow, these two FF movies are NOT cynical, they are NOT dark, the heroes are NOT blood-thirsty maniacs, they are ordinary people. The Urban Dictionary defines ""cheesy"" as: 'sentimental, maudlin, melodramatic, corny'. Well, guess what? The old Lee/Kirby Fantastic Four WAS 'sentimental, maudlin, melodramatic, corny'. I liked FF1, I LOVE FF2. Why? Because the SPIRIT of the comics is right there, right up on screen.I am going to be very specific when discussing ""FF:RotSS"", so what follows will contain SPOILERS. All issue references concern the original run of the comic, which began in 1961.The movie adapts the events of two famous story arcs from the period (1965-1968) considered to be the pinnacle of the collaboration between Stan Lee (writer) and Jack Kirby (artist). Those stories are in issues #48-50 (known as 'the Galactus trilogy'), and #57-60 (Dr. Doom steals the Surfer's power).Tim Story and crew have made a much better movie this time out. The team members themselves are now very comfortable with their powers, and that translates on-screen into them having FUN. The FF always has featured bickering and corny jokes, and that is highlighted early on, without getting too over-the-top. The action really kicks in once we get to the wedding, and the Surfer appears.All of the FF's power effects are very, very well done, most notably Sue's invisibility. The Surfer looks just outstanding, his visualization is believable in the way that Gollum from LOTR was: we forget quickly that this is a special effect, and engage with the character. His backstory is presented intact, and he slowly starts to reclaim his lost humanity. Sue is presented as the catalyst for his change of heart, in a way that Alicia was used in the comics.A note about Chris Evans: he is the swaggering, exuberant heart of these 'FF' movies. Johnny has a definite character arc in this movie, and Evans has a good time showing us the more aware side of the Torch, along with the bravado and self-promotion that is the source of much humor. He never allows Johnny to be anything less than likable, and he gets some of the best scenes, including a very satisfying, Super-Skrull style trashing of Dr. Doom late in the movie.Galactus...the original ""Galactus trilogy"" was a 3-issue meditation on the meaning of ""Evil"", moral relativism, and the significance of Life itself. The events pivoted around a character called The Watcher, who is cosmically powerful, but sworn to non-interference. Stan Lee had spent 4 years slowly creating the ""Marvel Universe"" that the FF inhabited, and FF #48-50 was an expansion of various concepts he had already touched on previously. A feature film introducing THREE humanoid all-powerful cosmic beings (Watcher, Galactus, Silver Surfer), and prominently theorizing about the absolute value of life in the cosmos might be labeled ""pretentious"" by some, especially when the source material is a comic book. I would love to see that story myself, but I am critiquing ""FF:RotSS"" based on what it IS, not what it IS NOT. What we get is a streamlined story of global destruction that builds tension to a decent payoff. Galactus DOES appear at the very end, but his headpiece is engulfed in the film's equivalent of ""Kirby dots"", which were the artist's trademark way of illustrating random, seething energy.The movie quotes numerous scenes and images from the books of 1961-1967, too many to list completely here. Notable examples of this are:> FF #60 p. 5: Doom uses the power cosmic to create a cyclone, just like in the film;> FF #49 p. 10 pnl 1-2: visualization of a world destroyed by Galactus, similar to the movie's opening shot; > FF Annual #3 (1965) p. 23 pnl 4-6: Stan and Jack are barred from Reed/Sue's wedding reception, and Stan is kept out in the movie; > FF #59 p. 14 pnl 1: Doom deliberately causes freezing weather while flying overhead, in the movie the Surfer does the same thing unintentionally.My one serious criticism of ""FF:RotSS"" is the total absence of Kirby's signature crazy machinery. The FF comic book became stuffed full of elaborate gadgets and vehicles early on in the series, and the movie lags far behind. We get the Fantasti-car, but there is no Pogo Plane, Jet-cycle, etc. I take issue with those who decry ""FF:RotSS"" for its PG rating. I read these very stories when I was 10 years old, and I just do not understand people complaining about a comic book being made into a family movie. The jokes are not adolescent gross-out humor like ""Shrek"". The scene in the disco early on is typical, where the script has fun with the iconic image of Reed as a stuffed-shirt. This is done playfully, and is not a betrayal of the character. In fact, Reed declares a ""Nerd Manifesto"" later on that should warm the hearts of brainy, socially awkward teenage boys everywhere. The important thing, to me, is that THE MOVIE WORKS on its own terms, and remains terrifically entertaining from start to finish.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
189,powerfull_jedi,What a pleasant surprise,7,19 June 2007,"Well, for 2 you could do a lot worst these days, as far as movies are concerned. I knew there was a sequel coming out, the first one despite being so bad and unfunny managed to still make big bucks putting itself close to another comic book juggernaut(Batman) at that same year. I had little to no expectations for this movie and come out somewhat surprised, as if Tim Story read the feedback from the first movie and complied, granted that the movie still has it's flaws, it's still an enjoyable experience. On the eve of Sue Storm and Reed Richard's much televised and awaited wedding, a strange object appears from outer space and starts making odd changes. The military asks Reed to built a tracking device(which he builds secretly without Sue's knowledge) to track down this object. Said object happens to crash Sue and Reed's wedding, Johnny follows the object, only to discover it's an odd silver humanoid alien with a board. Their first confrontation ends soon and while tracking it down, an old acquaintance/enemy(Dr. Doom) of the team offers a helping hand, but his intentions are anything but good. The plot is pretty much it, nothing too fancy about it and the right amount of confrontation with Sue having to deal with her celebrity status, and Johnny also feels hurt that the team might be in danger of breaking up and that his powers are getting out of control. Here's the good part, the special effects are nice(save for some cartoony and well, obviously CG), which is what you expect from a superhero movie these days. The humor is frankly better then the original and it's a feel-good, often non-serious movie, nor very dark. Now here's the bad part... for a movie that's called Rise of the Silver Surfer his screen time is fairly small(and so is his «boss»'s) and he doesn't really do much, it's like Fox and Marvel's advertising of X-men 3 and the Angel character, remember that? Don't expect Victor Von Doom to have a much better confrontation then he did last time, it lasts a while longer but not by much but thank God, the annoying voice is gone. The storyline is kinda silly, it's amazing how the team and the army jump from one point of the globe to another, considering it's all done under a week. Also, why does the army have a prison in Siberia and what was the point of that torture scene? It's a superhero movie aimed at younger viewers, mostly, but what was that? Finally, once again Chris Evans and Mike Chikilis steal the show, with Jessica Alba and Ioan Grudoff being just as bad as their original roles: charisma-free. Still, if you have a chance be sure to check it out. If you're into light-hearted superhero movies this is for you.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
190,DarthPaul85,A mediocre sequel to a mediocre film.,5,18 June 2007,"I was not a big fan of the first fantastic four movie, but I must admit I had a good time watching it. I thought perhaps this sequel would be a chance to keep the same entertainment with a better script. Boy was I wrong.Perhaps it's wrong to criticize a ""comic-book movie"" for having a contrived plot or a weak script...so taking THOSE things for granted, it's still lacking what any superhero movie needs: action.The biggest problem with the action scenes (if there even is more than one) is the lack of an antagonist. The silver surfer is rather elusive and demure. The FF don't so much fight a villain as they do chase him or try to slow down the destruction of whatever environment they're in. No spoilers, but I definitely saw the FF fight buildings and debris more often than any person.So that's my review. Even ignoring the weak story, the bad dialogue, and the directionless acting (except for ron perlman) that one might expect, there is also a disappointing lack of action. I was hoping for a roller-coaster, and I felt like I was stuck waiting in line.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
191,SeptumSin,not as bad as I would have thought,6,16 September 2008,I've been avoiding this movie like it was Catwoman and many of the things I've read about it reminds me of the fact. In truth however this isn't near as bad as I've heard. Maybe the whole thing about low expectations...The movie starts out with the group right where they left off in the first movie and how they are starting to fight with each other's values as some are trying to settle down while others are heating things up. Meanwhile a planet destroying fiend is making his way towards the earth and an old villain shows up to try and shake things up.This movie was predictable and it was indeed a fairly brainless action film. Many of the points made were not bad when it comes to comic book movies and it was enjoyable to watch. The battles were fun and even if the other characters don't fit their old school comic book character types the main four have the chemistry down right. Over all if you get a shot at this in the $5 bin I say go for it you'll have a liitle fun.,Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
192,BJBatimdb,"if you don't expect too much, you won't be disappointed",6,6 August 2007,"Unlike some other reviewers of Silver Surfer, I didn't expect this sequel to improve on the first film. In my opinion, sequels rarely do. In these super-hero flicks it's ALWAYS more fun to see the initial changes taking place, the fish-out-of-water elements unfolding etc.However, Silver Surfer still manages to be an action-packed, fun and pretty human story, with the 'still-adjusting' bit coming in the form of Invisible Girl and Mr Fantastic trying to tie the knot while threats to the planet interfere with their tux hire and seating arrangements. There are some cool stunts and good lines and it's always just nice to find that someone's taken a bit of care over a sequel.Ioan Gruffudd looks much more confident in his role than in the first movie; only Michael Chiklis is a little under-used in this film.I rented the first movie because I was not sure it would be worth seeing at the cinema, but I happily paid to go and see this film and didn't feel I'd had anything but value for money.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

194,sanddragon939,A grossly underrated Fantastic experience!!!!,9,7 May 2009,"Off late, especially with the relatively recent success of The Dark Knight, the general perception of audiences seems to be that the darker and more 'realistic' the tone of a superhero film, the more success it attains. While this is certainly true if you consider the two Nolan-directed Batman films, the first two X-men films, Burton's 1989 Batman film and a few others I could name; the truth is that it is not merely the dark tone that makes the film successful but the little things like plot construction, storytelling, characterization etc. which are oft overlooked these days. Another factor to be taken into account is whether a dark tone suits the character. Batman and the X-men may be dark because that tone suits the world they inhabit and the kind of stories that can be told with their characters. But try making Superman dark, and you'll find the result is not all that endearing. Which is why, I've never really understood the criticism directed towards the Fantastic Four films in general, and this one in particular for their 'campiness' and 'unrealism'. After all the Fantastic Four have always been campy and fun, because they were created in an era where comics were supposed to be campy and fun. After all, you cant expect a franchise which revolves around a family of celebrity superheroes constantly bickering with one another to be exactly dark and serious can you. And as far as the unrealism bit is concerned, the Fantastic Four have always been fantasy characters: they have always been about breaking the barriers and exploring new worlds of science and mysticism. They were never meant to be all that realistic in the first place. Which is why I think this film, while certainly not one the epic scale of TDK, is definitely one of the better superhero movies of all time. The campiness and the humour is present, though not over the top. The plot is simple, yet effective. The special effects are outstanding. And even amidst all the humour and fantasy, we have a few 'down to earth' character moments which remind us that our heroes are, after all, ordinary people with their own likes, dislikes, fears and anxieties. Reed Richards(Ion Gruduff) is torn between his dedication to science and to protecting the world. Sue Storm(Jessica Alba) is concerned about the effect of the team's very public superhero lifestyle will have on her future with Reed. Chris Evans does a great job as the Ben Grimm, interacting well with other characters and generally doing a good job as the resident strongman of the team. But as with the first film, it is Michael Chilkins who steals the show with his portrayal of Johnny Storm. The character is developed much further from being the shallow showman and exhibitionist of the previous film. While those external trappings are still present, even emphasized in the sequel, Johnny is portrayed as being a lot deeper. We empathize with him over his 'alienation' from the team due to his abnormal 'power problems', understand his frustration when he learns that Reed and Sue secretly plan to end their superheroic careers, and his feeling of guilt when he realizes he is continuously letting down his friends due to his hot-headedness. Johnny greatly grows as a character in this installment, though of course, it is Reed and Sue who remain the 'real' protagonists. The film does have a few flaws though. One of them is the Silver Surfer. Not so much the portrayal of the character (Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburn do a great job on that and the effects are spectacular), but I often thought that the Silver Surfer's background could have been expanded upon, given that he is the title character and the perceived 'villain' for much of the film. His origins and his connection to Galactus could have been brought out more clearly. Also, as in the previous film, the climax, though excellently filmed, could have been more elaborate. We have Johnny Storm acquiring the powers of all his teammates and fighting Doctor Doom but the main antagonist, Galactus, appears for all of three minutes as a giant cloud and the whole 'end of the world' thing is over before you know it. If the Silver Surfer is not the villain, then Galactus is, but the Fantastic Four don't even face him, which does not lend too much credibility to him being the primary antagonist. So is Dr. Doom the real villain then. It seems likely, but then again, Doom does spend most of the film working with the Fantastic Four to capture the Silver Surfer. Basically, we have a good plot, good dialogue, characterization etc. but no clear focus on the antagonist. Otherwise, this film is truly a fantastic experience!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
195,MinorityReporter,Fantastic? By no means! Better than the first? Indeed it is!,5,8 July 2007,"Just like the first movie in the series this one had problems but somehow it just seems a lot more polished. The dialog is better, the story seems less like a pilot episode for a TV-series and the villain actually seems like a threat to the Fantastic Four this time around. So while your money might be better spent going with Spider-Man 3, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is by no means a bad choice either. The entire cast from the first movie returns (always a plus, I hate it when there are changes in the cast in sequels) and rehashes their characters and in some cases improves on them.Acting wise the movie is not far removed from its predecessor. Which is both good and bad. Ioan Gruffudd returns as Reed Richards and does pretty much exactly what he did in the first movie. He does, however, have a little more to work with and while his motivations seem a little vague he does do a decent job of it. Jessica Alba is once again smoking hot and just like in the first movie her performance is a little dodgy. She is not always completely believable but it can be forgiven. Michael Chiklis has a lot less to work with this time around and has been reduced to serving almost entirely as comic relief which he is great at but given his emotional range is a shame. We saw in the first movie that he was capable of portraying the emotions of the character through all the prosthetics (which must have been hard) and therefore we/I would have liked to see more from him. On the other hand Chris Evans gets a chance to show a little more of the character in this installment and it works great. Its fantastic to see cracks in the armor of a character who has previously seemed so unshakable. Evans is completely believable and once again 100% lovable. We expect great things from him in the future. Julian McMahon returns as well and he ups the stakes for Dr. Doom who becomes more menacing that he ever was in the first movie. Nice to see. The major draw in this movie is of course the emergence of the Silver Surfer one of the most beloved characters from the comics and he looks great and with the majestic vocals of Laurence Fishbourne he truly comes alive on the screen and his first appearance is nothing short of spectacular.Effects wise the movie has taken a great step in the right direction. The effects seem to have matured greatly from the first movie and this makes the film so much more interesting to watch. The Human Torch still looks fantastic on the screen and Mr. Fantastic's stretching powers seem much more credible this time around. The real money shots, however, are of course of the Silver Surfer who looks nothing short of spectacular. As previously stated his first real on screen appearance is one of the most entertaining sequences I have seen this summer. His powers look great as well and every scene with him has a spectacular effect of some sort. Galactus also makes a very brief appearance and he looks nothing like in the comics and for what its worth I think he looked great with some nods to his comic book appearance. All in all I think the movie looks great and this has to be a kudos to Tim Story who received a lot of bashing for the first movie.In terms of the writing the film still has a few issues but is indeed a definite improvement on the first film in the series. The villain has true menace this time around and a lot more is at stake. Both personally for the characters but also globally. The exchanges between Chiklis and Evans are still filled with humor and charm. Their scenes also seem to have a profound sense of warmth and despite their differences their friendship is indisputable. The scenes with the Silver Surfer are the most dramatic and in my opinion they work great and the Surfer has great authority (helped greatly by Fishbourne's vocals). The scenes between Gruffudd and Alba are sadly still a weak point. They seem forced and not always believable.All in all Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is an entertaining summer movie that takes the franchise it builds upon to new and exciting levels and is a clear improvement on the first film in the series. However, it is still not without its problems but works on the basis that you don't expect it to be a revelation.7/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

The movie is often dark, funny and exciting at the same time.Hey, as far as second servings go, it's no ""Empire Strikes Back,"" (it's not even a ""Jaws 2""), but it keeps one in their seat for its rather short, 90-minute running time.Picking up from where the initial film left off, our intrepid quartet (the ultra flexible Reed Richards, Ioan Gruffudd; invisible force-field lady Sue Storm, Jessica Alba; human torch Johnny Storm, Chris Evans; and the rock-like monstrosity Ben Grimm, Michael Chiklis) is now used to the constant publicity extolling their exploits.Johnny is especially prone to this publicity, constantly looking to make endorsement deals and mugging before any camera he sees.The paparazzi is even ga-ga over the upcoming wedding of Reed and Sue (despite the oil-vinegar mix of the beautiful, sensual young lady and the goofy dullard), which has been in the works several times now, always falling through at the last minute.Meanwhile, a strange meteor flashes across the globe, completely freezing whatever it passes over (the Sea of Japan, the Sphinx, Los Angeles, etc.); the anomaly also creates huge craters and eventually dries up the surrounding vicinity.During the latest wedding, the phenomenon disrupts electrical and communication transmissions and causes a helicopter to crash, wrecking chairs and ruining a lot of perfectly good food. It's a literal media circus, not unlike the nuptials between Sean Penn and Madonna.Johnny Torch then follows the thing, only to discover it is the Silver Surfer (we have a title!), who is the guide for Galactus, a huge cloudy entity that absorbs and destroys planets to stay alive.Look, this premise was never really fleshed out in the film, suffice it to say the CGI looks pretty awesome here (not during the rest of the movie, though). Anyway, the Surfer pummels the Torch and escapes. His flyover also thaws out Dr. Vincent von Doom (Julian McMahon, ""Premonition"") from his metallic freeze prison, which adds another villainous subplot.In addition, a group of gung-ho soldiers, led by Gen. Hagar (Andre Braugher, ""Glory,"" ""Poseiden""), gets involved, as well. And, thanks to his contact with the Surfer (body by Doug Fisher, voiced by Laurence Fishburne), Torch loses control of his powers, passing them along to the other three and taking upon theirs in turn.These are the rare funny moments in this picture.Finally, Reed (who is reluctantly forced to accept von Doom's assistance) tracks down and captures the Surfer with a series of scientific devices that we - as the audience - have no business comprehending. It is only then that we discover the humanity of the character.He doesn't mean to lead the carnivorous Galactus to eat, digest and eliminate all these worlds, he's just made that way, I suppose. No one realizes this more than Sue, who tries to convince him that, somehow, helping to destroy the Earth would be a bad thing ...After a short, climatic battle, however, things just come to a rather unsatisfying conclusion. We're never really presented with the motivation behind what Galactus is or why its always so hungry for energy; or, as an all-powerful, omnipotent being, why it needs the Silver Surfer in the first place.Still, with all of its faults, its often disjointed plot line, its ambiguous ending, it still keeps you interested, and its short duration is just enough time to spend with these rather tepid superheroes.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
197,shiftyeyeddog,A record-breaking Eyeroll Tally,4,5 July 2007,"The first Fantastic Four was pretty bad. The writing bad, the casting horrible, the FX lacking but it was harmless enough. There have been crappy superhero movies before, and there will certainly be plenty more in the future. But a sequel?? Really?? What won't they make sequels to these days.They learned nothing from their mistakes on the first film. The Thing's costume is still terrible and looks like something out of a mid-80's flick, and his one-liners (mostly consisting of about 10 ""sorry's"" and ""my bad's"") are just annoying. Julian Glover as Dr. Doom is horribly miscast. Reed's stretching effects just look laughable - it's one of those powers that just does not translate to the screen well. Jessica Alba again looks goofy with fake blond hair, but now they've added the creepiest fake blue eye contacts you've ever seen, and just can't stop staring at them whenever she's on screen. Stan Lee's cameos continue to be distracting and stupid.But they didn't stop there - this sequel has failed on more levels. First and foremost, the Eyeroll Tally was OFF THE CHARTS. From every cheesy line to every bad joke, every dumb plot point to every stupid sight gag or bad effects shot, you couldn't help rolling your eyes. The one big theme they beat us over the head with is teamwork. Johnny (Human Torch) is told he's a loner and needs to learn to work as a team. So how does he do this in the end? By taking on everyone else's powers and fighting the final battle by himself. Huh?!??! That's teamwork? This flick was every bit as bad as any of the direct-to-video or 80's Marvel movies. Now there's talk they want to do a spin-off Silver Surfer movie. HELL no! His character is boring, unimpressive, and uninteresting in his brief scenes here, much less an entire film. The torch/surfer chase was pretty cool, but it's too bad everyone had seen that in its entirety in the first trailer. When Surfer loses his silver ""luster"" he looks hilarious as just some dude painted dark gray, and trying to cash in on Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus credibility by having him voice the Surfer was just lame. Fishburne adds nothing here.Like I said, I've seen worse flicks, and I know this was geared more for kids, but even kids deserve better. And with so many better flicks to choose from, I hope they find something else to spend their money on.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
198,silentcheesedude,It should have been better,5,11 May 2009,"Amid the fact that there was every opportunity to make a better movie, such as a larger budget, an interesting character that is Silver Surfer, the origin set up out of the way, and years of comic book lore to tap into, Rise of the Silver Surfer seemed to be nothing more then a slight shadow of what could have been.Now, the action was more intense then the first, I thought. What made them give this a PG was the general mildness of it all, very little or no blood. Safe for any child that can watch Y7 rated shows on Cartoon Network. Perhaps that is where they went wrong. Besides, the general fan base isn't really 7 yrs old, it's 20's, 30's, 40's, and older because they read the comics so long ago. Maybe, but then you have the short running time of barely 90 minutes. We were in and out before we even had a shot to get to know this new character suggested in the title of the movie. Or perhaps it was the fact that that when the grand finale came about we were so completely underwhelmed that we felt cheated on the setup that seemed a lot larger then it really was.It seems that I would be contradicting what I said on the comment for the first Fantastic Four, that comic book movies should not be expected to be the same. Movies are movies and comics are comics. But here... at the end of the movie,(no spoiler) it was like robbing you of something important. So diluted and so unreasonable was the ending, that everything before it suddenly becomes useless. It removes the reality of the Silver Surfer back story, destroying it and making it unintelligent. A simplified, pat ending that was probably placed there by suits that perhaps wanted to pack everything in a short movie and keep it at a lower budget then other summer blockbusters. I don't know. Maybe it was the writers, the director, I'm not checking. It's just not worth it for me to do so because I am so saddened. And I'm not even a Silver Surfer fan.Considering the relatively low gross, smaller then the first, I don't think we will foresee a fantastic four 3. So long FF. See you in 20 years when holograms are the new fad.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
199,Astralan,Not quite the comic book I would read,7,1 July 2007,"The curtain goes up, you get your precursor to the story, the camera finally comes to the stars of the show. I had a flag of warning at that moment: Thing's rocky shell seemed somehow less weighted, he moved far to easy in it unlike he did in the previous installment; Sue was.. well... there was way too much hair spray; Johnny and Reed were just too clean. I'm sorry, but that seems to go against the trend to make things more believable in this decade. Batman Begins was almost perfect. Life for the Bat to be was dirty, violent and full of misery. You could at least feel some of his pain. The relationship between Susan and Reed were almost Barbie-ish. I was pleased to see Alicia (Kerry Washington) return - at least thing had some intimacy to balance his clobbering ability.While the movie had many weaknesses, as a story it was good. The Silver Surfer was undaunted in his focus, preparing the earth to be consumed by his master Galactus. For the most part, if I was between the ages of 12 and 21, I might have enjoyed it more... especially if I had read the graphic novels of the Fantastic Four (Then again, maybe not - specially if I was a purist). But reluctantly, as an old fat, I could watch the film and be critical of it simply because there really wasn't much there in the offering plate for me to munch on with a pleasant demeanor. The CGI, though good in some spots (the Galactus cloud creature as it starts to penetrate the Earths atmosphere was quite well done, and the Silver Surfer reminiscent of the T-1000 in Judgment Day), there were many other uses that just didn't seem to rise to the polish expected in a live action/CGI film.Aside from being almost short in it's running time (92 minutes), the story sometimes confused children, which was evident in the amount of chatter going on around me and my friends. There was one adult that took calls all the way through the film, and a carpool of kids behind us were eating something that required removal from a crackling cellophane that just got extremely annoying after the first 20 minutes. Parent bringing their 3 to 6 year old kids to this thing are just totally oblivious to the sensibility of raising children. They probably couldn't get a baby sitter, so they just allowed their kids to wanter the rows of seats and play on the outside isle steps. For a viewing audience, especially for this grumpy old turd, it just did nothing but aggravate the review of this movie to almost a negative experience.Mom? Dad? If your little kiddie seems to not really be interested in the film or is totally confused by it, it may mean the tyke is not ready for this stuff at this time in his/her development. Maybe your should wait for the DVD and pass up the theater experience. OK???? Thanks!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
200,keesha45,"""Well, you got me, pal""",6,10 August 2007,"Having just seen this at the Garland Theatre,a second-run discount theater in my neighborhood,I'm glad I didn't pay for a full price cineplex ticket. Not that it's a stinker, but it just doesn't qualify as a very good film in the superhero genre. There's a telling bit in the wedding scene where Marvel honcho Stan Lee is refused entry to the event. Stan and Marvel have not had a lot going their way this year. SPIDERMAN 3 is doing just OK at the box office, but, worse, it's collecting less than stellar reviews from some quarters who say it's the worst of the trilogy.The X-MEN franchise is going downhill also and there don't seem to be any comic superheroes waiting in the wings for Marvel to take Hollywood by storm as Spidey and X-Men did. If it's any consolation, Superman and Batman are not doing much better on the big screen. These things go in cycles, though, and I'm sure the comic book superhero will rebound again. It will take some new faces and characters to do it probably, but the superhero is not dead, it's just like a sleeping volcano that's bound to erupt again. Getting back to this movie, I give it good marks for some clever plot devices. The wedding was played way too straight, though, and the director should have either given it more humor or more suspense. The switching of super powers was another thing that should have been given more play, and the possible breakup of the team should also have been emphasized more than with just a few lines like my summary quote by Thing to Johnny. At just 91 minutes, this film was just way too short to develop much of the storyline better. Sometimes, more is not better, but in this case, what I saw on the screen just left me wanting more. It was mildly entertaining, but SILVER SURFER never got me, pal. Dale Roloff",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
201,WelshFilmCraze,Hugely entertaining sequel that's a significant improvement on it's predecessor .,7,4 January 2010,"The Fantastic Four are back in action, trying to save the world once more, this time from mysterious alien 'The Silver Surfer' whose creating havoc by inflicting blackouts and huge craters throughout the World,Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) & Susan Storm (The rather tasty Jessica Alba) are due to get married, but their nuptials are disrupted by the arrival of the Silver Surfer, and so along with Johnny Storm & Ben Grimm (Hunky Chris Evans & Michael Chiklis respectively) go into battle.A lot of money was spent on this sequel ($130M +) and it shows with amazing special FX, The story being a PG rated film is family friendly and doesn't require a PHD in comic books to follow, and also being PG rated the violence is pretty much non-existent so anybody expecting something in the vein of 'The Punisher' this isn't for you... but. everybody else - young or old should find a lot of light hearted enjoyment from the Fantastic Quartet... which is FAR better than the original.Highly Recommended.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
202,The_Defiant1,"Okay, But The Trailer Leads You To Believe It's Better",7,10 July 2007,"This movie is the much awaited sequel to the first Fantastic Four movie. On special effects, this movie delivers. On acting quality, it delivers. Where the story loses it is in the plot focus and the dialog. The movie is just filled with too many stupid elements that are side by side with all the visually stunning elements. Do we really care about the Fantastic Four's struggle with privacy? I didn't. Did we really need the Fantastic Four members swapping powers. I didn't feel it was necessary. Even the presence of Dr. Doom seemed unnecessary. This movie could have stood alone on the core story. This movie is worth buying on DVD or renting, but overall the story detracts from the special effects. If not for that, I would have rated it higher.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

204,Strider_1978,All that money on special effects. . no way????,4,12 July 2007,"So anyway. .I heard this vicious rumour that most of the budget for this film had been spent on special effects. Nah, Hollywood wouldn't to that to us these days, not after Spiderman 3.Actually I had a hard time watching this film because the cheese kept getting in my eyes, the cheese that was dripping down the screen from start to finish.I can't give it a five because it didn't interest me enough to warrant enough exploration of who was who and what was happening. If you are a teenager and you like the Olsen twins this might be the film for you. I went to see it with my wife because my wife wanted to see it.I'm not saying it's diabolical, it does have some mildly fun parts.

205,Neenee-b,Fantastic Sequel,8,16 June 2007,"For the record I realise that FF:ROTSS was not pretending or trying to be a serious, thought provoking film with subtle digs at the war in Iraq or the collapse of todays modern society. It wanted to be a fun, entertaining family summer movie and that is exactly what it was. The cast all play well of each other. This time around there seemed to be more Ben and Johnny, which was great for comedy value. The ""rock slide"" line had the audience (pretty much sold out) in stitches and it was really good to see the fun side of Ben. Ben seemed much more relaxed and had accepted his new lifestyle and powers 2nd time around. Bens relationship with Alicia was cute, I'm glad we got to see a bit more of her. As much as I liked The Thing in the first film, he really shone in the second one and I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed it when he was on screen. Reed was still as nerdy as ever. He took charge more this time around and was more of a team leader His speech were he tore shreds of the General was great fun to watch and yes I was so hot for him right then There had been a lot of bad vibes surround Jessica Alba as Sue, but I thought that they were unjustified. She never is going to be a fantastic (no pun) actress but she was fine here. There were rumours of another Jessica Alba underwear shot but all I saw was her naked shoulder when she was lying on the pavement unless of course I blinked and missed it. Her hair was OK. Her hair was not OK during the Japanese wedding scene. I didn't like the style. At least it will give all the hair haters some ammunition. I didn't quite know what to make of Johnny, at times I felt quite sympathetic towards him like when Reed shouted at him for almost getting every body killed and other times he came across as bratty. He still got all the fun lines through and he still was my favourite. He almost stole the show again but Ben and him were equal and his scenes with Sue were much better. The dad would be proud hug at the first wedding in the movie was sweet. I don't get Doom at all. I'm not experienced with the Fantastic Four comics but he is just a real weedy villain in this movie. Anyway Doom stole the board and got his butt kicked by Johnny and fell into a river never to be spoken of again. I'm sure he will be even more p'd off and turn up in the third one for even less screen time. The SS looked great and there is no denying that. The voice was fine. Some more action involving the SS would have been nice.We saw an awful lot of what he could do in the trailers so I felt a little bit let down with what screen time he actually got. The chase scene with Johnny seemed shorter in the film when I actually thought this scene would have been longer. I don't quite understand how he stopped Galactus and saved the world - but it looked good anyway and I've heard that it is all set up nicely for a SS spin off. We got a few snippets of back storey from SS but some more detail would have been nice. Alicia is a great character. I like the way she can completely see through Johnny and I hope that they keep Alicia and Bens relationship going into the next film. The General acted annoyed all through the movie and i enjoyed him being taken down a few pegs by Reed and had not much sympathy for him when he got fried by Doom. Surely if had the experience and intelligence to be a General in the United States army he could see right through Dooms oh so obvious evil scheme. He clearly didn't read the internal email about Doom being evil! The plot wasn't exactly taxing but it didn't matter as on the whole it seemed to be wrapped up nicely in the end complete with oriental wedding with the same Minister showing up in Japan - which was pretty funny! It was perhaps a bit to convenient that Doom woke up just as the SS arrived but that's timing for you. If Doom had the means and ability to speak to the SS face to face could he not have figured out how to knock him of his board by himself? How did Doom know where to meet the Surfer. The whole part with Doom joining the good guys just did not work for me at all. I was never sure about the Fantasticar as it always seemed cheesy to me but I am so glad I was proved wrong. The flying scenes were great to watch especially when it split into three parts! Johnny taking on everyone's powers looked cool. I don't understand how he managed to have all four powers at once but it doesn't really matter and his fight with Dooms was definitely the best in the movie. I thought that it was a bit on the short side though. Overall it was how all sequels should be - more action, more comedy and made on a grander scale! It set out what it intended to do very well I would give it 8 out of 10. It loses a point automatically for being a sequel and it losses another point for the whole Doom joining up with the General to capture the Surfer. I just didn't buy that at all. There will be haters of that movie, many of whom hated the movie before they even saw it, but it is definitely a solid, fun family movie!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
206,ARTaylor,"Still Mindless Fun, Slight Improvement on the First",7,20 May 2011,"I've never been much into the Fantastic Four. I think Thing is dynamic and Doctor Doom is interesting. But I never much cared for the others. They did get interesting in the Civil War when they broke up and started fighting each other. However, I really can't think of a specific FF story that stands out from the others, certainly not like Spider-Man's Death of the Stacys or Iron Man's Armor Wars, other than the coming of Galactus.The first movie was largely a disappointment. But that just means I got my disappointment out of the way and found myself enjoying this one. Sure the problems remain, but they don't seem as crippling. I already know that Doom, Reed, and Sue are miscast so I can merely accept them here for what they are.Everyone does seem to be trying just a little harder this time. Gruffudd is still plodding along with the technical jargon, but he seems a little more comfortable with it. Alba is still there to be breasts that walk with another scene thrown in just to show off her body, but she does show some improvement. Even Tim Story seems to be trying to be more than just mediocre.I really liked how they humbled Johnny this time around, so he isn't merely an arrogant jerk. Sure he tries to be, but they show there's more to him than that. However, I didn't care for how Thing is basically there with not a lot to do. They seemed to lose that tortured inner self that made him so interesting in the first. I also enjoyed the publicly known heroes aspect of the story. Sure, Iron Man 2 did it so much better, but they were the first to try it and there are some interesting aspects in it all.Doctor Doom is a little more, but not entirely, like we know and love him. I like that they show him doing more than just hating everyone else and actually developing some kind of evil scheme. It's just a shame that they didn't push that more.The real stand out of the movie is the Silver Surfer. He stole the spotlight in the original comic story and steals the movie. Surfer is, by far, the most dynamic character in the movie. There's little hints of his story that they would have expanded on in the proposed SS spin-off. Doug Jones is perfect for him. He perfectly captures those iconic Surfer movements. Though I wish they kept his voice rather than bringing on Fishburne, which just seemed unnecessary. Jones fit the voice just fine, and it seems Fishburne was brought on because he was the cool guy from The Matrix.I know many people bemoan the portrayal of Galactus here, but I liked it. Sure they go with the Ultimate Gah Lak Tus cloud rather than the 616 giant, but it's not like the movie is really hurt by not seeing the giant. From what I read, they would have shown the giant Galactus in the SS spin-off. I do appreciate that they left some mystery to it/him to be explored later.Neither of the Fantastic Four movies were anything that could be considered classics. They were more meant to be mindless popcorn films. This one showed that with time they may have made them more than that, but I'm certainly not sad they're not making a third. Brief aside, if they do reboot the series, I truly hope they bring back Evans and Chiklis as they were certainly the bright spots in this dull series.It's fun taking for what it is. But there's still some problems preventing this from being a great film. My rating 7/10.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
207,toutouguy,Not too shabby,7,11 February 2019,"Potential for a great movie, the Surfer is a great character and has underrated and amazing abilities. I'd say he's one of the strongest characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The chase scene between the Human Torch and Surfer was amazing.Overall, the movie touched a bit on that greatness but fell short. My personal rating is probably leaning more towards a 6.5 than a 7.5 but obviously we cannot include decimals in our rating so the movie earns a solid 7. Perhaps production costs prevented what could have been an amazing movie.Anyone saying, ""it sucked"" are exaggerating but those saying it was amazing have probably not seen many films to judge appropriately.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
208,deanbean317,The Comic Book Movie Genre Takes a Huge Hit,1,19 June 2007,"This is one of the first movies I can say I hated from beginning to end!After the opening fifteen minutes, I felt like going back out to the lobby and staring at the cardboard cutout display, knowing I would find better acting there than was present on the screen.Perhaps I have reached the point of CG overload, but it seems the more things blow up, fly through the air or transform miraculously, the more I yawn. People are falling all over themselves drooling over the physical appearance of the Silver Surfer. I too was impressed...BACK IN 1991 WHEN I SAW THE SAME EFFECT IN TERMINATOR 2!!! In the sixteen years that have transpired, they haven't improved on that original effect one iota. What they have managed to do is make Jessica Alba look like a bad special effect, not when she's invisible mind you, but in her live action scenes. The poor girl seems to be the victim of bad collagen injections in the kisser and a drive-by spray painting with five minute tanning solution.The only thing that amazes me more than this total creative vacuum of a movie, is the number of ten star reviews that it is getting!

209,redeyedtree,What's up!,9,23 October 2007,"When I first heard that they were making a sequel to Fantastic 4 I was all aglow. The original was an enjoyable action/sci-fi/romantic comedy. The acting was great. The actors were aesthetically great. The computer graphics were great. The story was fantastic. (Sorry, I had to slip that one in.) There were the dark and light elements, good and evil. Compared to some of the other comic-book-come-movie productions it was intense but light - the quality was good but the comic book feel was ever present. A lot of thought wasn't necessary and yet there was a plot and subplots and complex relationships. Plus, there were CGI/scenery bits that got missed the first time around... which was bait to watch it over and over. So, I had mixed expectations. I was hoping Silver Surfer was going to match and even exceed Fantastic 4. On the other hand, my perception of the quality of most sequels is low. Closer to the release I read so many negative reviews. Family circumstances being what they were a short time ago I missed it's big-screen showing. Disappointed, I eagerly awaited the release at my local DVD shop. That was today. I cannot say that I liked Silver Surfer more than Fantastic 4 but I absolutely enjoyed it as much. I recommend it and I will purchase a copy. I am intrigued at some hints that there might be chapters. If they maintain or better this quality then I say very emphatically, 'bring it on'!!!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
210,chimera-4,Better than the first but still some flaws,8,28 June 2007,"I was one of the minority that enjoyed the first FF movie albeit on a guilty level. I also agreed with the majority of criticism thrown at it but still found it relatively inoffensive despite all this. It had a level of hokeyness that sometime worked for it and sometimes against it. I'll admit also that some of the dialog was terrible (and it hasn't got much better here either)and some of the action just silly (that hasn't changed either although it is better in the second one). I thought it an OK setup for a franchise that entertained on a really base level.**MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD** Well I had really low expectations for this one since there were a lot of reviews panning it all over the place for various different reasons from crappy FX to deviation from source material. I actually found it to be really enjoyable and much better than the first one. There were still flaws, some pretty major but nothing that I really felt spoiled the film. The biggest bug bear is bound to be the representation of Galactus, basically he's just a big cloud although there are a few times where you can see a hint of the old comic book Galactus but they're like blink and you've missed them. They could have gotten away with having him more obviously in the centre of the cloud at the end and that would have satisfied most people. It made more sense to have Galactus in the form he is in here but I felt they could have alluded more to the old Galactus as well, you know, for fans, the people this movie is surely mostly aimed at if it wants to make any money.The other gripe people will have with this movie is the whole power swapping thing. Yes it's silly but it did make me laugh and would have worked if it hadn't been such a big deal at the end and they'd just left it as a silly gag that you could have forgotten about later.There's also continuity errors galore. We see countless shots of the Silver Surfer flying around knocking out power grids etc yet when he's being chased through the tunnel by the Torch the cars are all mysteriously working fine (unless I missed something). There's other things that anyone paying even a bit of attention will be able to point out, the biggest offender being **BIG SPOILER** when the Surfer seems to off Galactus so easily at the end after earlier saying that he had no choice but to be his herald as it meant his world was spared. Why didn't he just do what he did at the end of the movie? **END SPOILER**. I have a feeling that he is not so easily dealt with in the comic mythology and that the end of the movie was a contrivance bunged in there by the writers and film makers because they really didn't know what to do with the character. However it is left slightly ambiguous so you can kind of make up your own explanation. There is room for a bit of license on the part of the viewer.FX are generally pretty good across the board, they really nailed the look and character of the Silver Surfer although the lip sync on some of his CGI is a bit crummy. Jessica Alba still seems a bit miscast in her role but it's not too annoying. I think Gruffud fits the nerdy scientist role of Reed Richards pretty well. Chiklis as the Thing I've always thought was good casting although his acting as the Thing is better than his role in his human guise. Johnny Storm annoyed me a bit in the first movie, he was just a mouthy disrespectful punk that thought he knew it all. Here he's much the same although not quite as annoying and I really felt a smug satisfaction when he got lumbered with the Things powers.All the characters here have clearly had more time to get used to their powers with Alba being able to make other things invisible (was that in the comics?) and being able to explode people with internally generated forcefields (although we don't see that). Now onto Dr Doom. I'm not really sure why he was in the movie except as build up to the scene where **SPOILER** he get some of the Power Cosmic from the Surfers board. Just seems they needed another antagonist in there to fill a few minutes in an action scene. His character really doesn't develop at all and he still is nowhere near the Doom people will know from the comics.I also have to say that the film did an admirable (if not always successful) job at juggling all the characters here. We have four heroes and three villains and, with the exception of Doom, they feel they all fit well. Something I felt Spiderman 3 failed to achieve.In fact I felt I preferred this movie to Spiderman 3 which I just found tedious and crowded",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Plot- 10/10 (you have it all, good luck to the writers surpassing this part in the next movies)Acting- 8/10 (sorry Jessica)Action- 7/10 (well balanced fight scenes, few more wouldn't hurt)Effects- 9/10 (woudn't imagine it any other way)Amusement factor- 10/10 (it all blends well to keep you glued to your seat)Overall, I've seen this movie twice and don't regret the time spent.

212,Skutter-2,It was fantastic for me.,8,7 July 2007,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is surprisingly good. It is not great but I would have to say it is probably the most entertaining of the big summer blockbusters of 2007 that I have seen so far. It a time filled with overlong, overwrought and overstuffed action movies is a breath of fresh air. It is fun, quick paced and has a breezy 90 minute running time. It is true to the spirit of the original Fantastic Four comics, from what I have read of them- it doesn't take itself at all seriously, it is fast paced and is a platform for whatever crazy and wacky ideas the writers could come up with for the superheroes and the uses of their powers. The movie is very jokey but a lot of it actually funny, even the slapstick kind of stuff involving the Four swapping powers. I even got a chuckle out of some of Johnny Storm's smarmy one liners and the interactions between him and Ben Grimm are generally pretty entertaining. Everyone fits there roles quite well and seem to be having a good time. The acting isn't great but everyone brings what is required to their roles. Even Jessica Alba doesn't suck to badly- they easily could have gone down the whole angry wife/fiancé route with Sue Storm and Reed Richards but they don't go overboard on the melodrama. The characterisation is fairly lightly etched but at the right level for this kind of movie. Each of the characters has a personality but the makers don't try to turn it into a character piece and get bogged down with it. The Silver Surfer comes across a but of a selfish dick though- he was perfectly willing to help Galactus destroy those other planets draws the line when a woman on one particular planet reminds him of his own girlfriend? The action stuff if pretty good as well.The sequence with the Human torch chasing the Silver Surfer, as seen in the preview, is great and the battle sequence at the end involving two souped up multi-powered individuals is great fun. Even Galactus looks pretty cool, although is there was one element that could have had a bit more screen time it was the presence of Galactus, who's arrival and dispatch is a bit too quick. There is a lot material in this movie and at times in does seem a little rushed, hurrying from one plot point to the next but on the whole the movies swift pace is an asset. A slower pace is the kiss of death for silly, fantastical movies like this. There are some plot concerns, such as the fact that Galactus is willing to give a minion of who's loyalty he cannot be assured the capacity to destroy him but I was well inclined enough toward the movie to let it slide. It isn't a deep or a powerful movie but it is what is set outs to be, and what I wish more summer blockbusters would aim for, a fun movie with no delusions of grandeur.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
213,NJRocker091188,Not Fantastic But Much Better then First Movie.,6,24 June 2007,"OK this movie was good/ alright. Another good / alright movie for this year. I was it yesterday with some friends. And It wasn't better then SM3 but It was entirely better then Ghost Rider and more entertaining then the First Fantastic Four. The effects where alright, and the story was OK. And SS was cool. I just wish they showed more with his power then just him having power on the surf board. And Dr. Doom. What was he in it for? Just like in the first one he didn't really do much. And in this one when he comes into action, he didn't really do anything just by fly around. Didn't really try to fight The Fantastic Four just kinda blew holes in the water. But the movie it self was OK. And the jokes where OK too. The only thing with those is that they are started to get kinds old. However they where still kinda funny. Now this movie was better then the first so I give it a 8. But it still wasn't that great. But go, go see it for your self if you haven't already.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

However fantastic 4 is very campy to me in general.With that said this movie was par for the course imo. The saving grace is silver surfer. His character is awesome, he's a man without a home, drifting through the cosmos, a lost soul. And if you can't appreciate the character development I don't have anything to say. But surfer totally makes the movie to me. I literally googled ""silver surfer movie"" for three years after fantastic 4 sequel was released. And now 14 years later this is all we have. So rather than gripe I choose to enjoy this cinematic experience.I think you will enjoy it!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
215,pokedom,They screwed up Galactus. Here's a bunch of reasons why.,1,25 November 2017,"I don't even need to talk about anything that happens in the first half, because it's all dumb, boring, and visually looks really bad. The second half is where I wanted to lose hope in humanity.Around the start of the last half of the movie, they begin to tease Galactus. If you've never read a comic with him in it or never even played Marvel Vs Capcom 3, you probably don't know who that is. In essence, he's a giant man in a blue and purple suit under a big goofy purple helmet. He was once known as Galan in a universe before the prime one in the comics. He somehow survived the death of said Universe and was merged with an entity known as the Sentience of the Multiverse to become Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds, the Monster of All Worlds, The Hunger That Does Not Cease, etc. He's quite possibly my favorite villain in the entire Marvel franchise. You can't even kill him by conventional means. He can only be defeated by using The Ultimate Nullifier, and even then he manages to live on anyways. You can negotiate with him to become his Herald in exchange for your planet's safety, but you literally don't have an afterlife if you do so. And what Galactus hungers for, he takes without question. If your planet is the one he's after, your basically screwed. He's the final boss in Marvel Vs Capcom 3's arcade mode (and UMVC3), and while they did screw up his AI to the point where he's too easy, he still has some of the best lines and one of the best music tracks in the entire game. ""You dare pit your mystic arts against the Power Cosmic? ARROGANT FOOL!"" -Galactus. I'm just gonna copy and paste a link for the music at the bottom of this review so you can understand what we're dealing with here. Just listening to it without any knowledge of his actual design gives off a menacing vibe. Better still, you can actually play as him in all his glory in Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3! And it might be one of the most fun experiences you'll have in a while. Giant lasers, screen wide punch attacks, one-hit-kills, it's so much fun! God I love that game. Please purchase it! You will not be let down, unlike with this movie.So you can imagine my disappointment and rage when, in this garbage film, he's just a cloud of smoke.That's literally it. He's just a cloud of smoke. They tease his helmet in a scene where he goes over Saturn, and his helmet looks pretty okay. Then he actually arrives at Earth. There's no indication that he even has a helmet. There's no indication that he's even a he. He's just a cloud of ""cosmic"" vapor. And it kind of looks like a hand when it looms closer to the Earth. I don't- I DON'T KNOW! This is possibly the worst redesign a movie has ever given a villain. At least in Doctor Strange, Dormammu may look really bad compared to his actual comic book design, but they made up for that by having one of the coolest sequences in any movie, maybe ever!Botched design aside, whatever. Galactus is on Earth, and unless Reed Richards over here wants to give up his afterlife then Earth is about to be torn apart. Get ready for really cool destruction!...Oh wait, that didn't happen either.Literally all that happens in the climax where the cloud of smoke draws near is just that; the cloud of smoke draws near, the sky darkens... and that's it. No destruction, nothing cool, just a waste of time. And as Doctor Doom is fighting a powered-up version of The Human Torch, Silver Surfer flies up to stop him. Hah! What an idiot! He's already given up so much, and now he's trying to kill the unkillable!Oh. It actually worked. He literally threw his Silver Surfer brand Surfboard into the ""Heart of Galactus"" and blew up. Then Galactus went bye-bye. Wow. Just... wow.Please don't watch this movie. I don't even have anything else to say. I just... I just really want there to be an actually good version of Galactus in some movie soon. Read up on his history, I'll provide the link. Please do your research on the greatest Marvel villain of all time, and stay far away from this film.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glT8P09WC3Ihttp://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Galactus_(Earth-616)",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
216,a-little-squeek,Swoosh !...........,7,23 June 2007,"I liked this installment better than the first. Character development went to the next level and the introduction of the Silver Surfer was acceptable. Exploration of the S.S. character as the 'Herald of Galactus' might leave a hole in some folk's understanding of the evolution of The Fantastic Four, and some other Marvel characters, within this pop genre literature. I would suggest going to Wikipedia and reading up on 'Marvel Universe' to gain further insight into the thought process and development behind the milieu. Stan Lee's cameo was great and I am happy to see that he is finally getting the recognition (and paycheck) he deserves for the concept and development of this genre. Story line, acting, screen play, dialog, scoring are all good and this film plays true to the comic book format at its roots. I found it, over all, to be an enjoyable experience, however.....it did cost me $8. to get in plus $5. for a SMALL popcorn , I brought my own bottle of water. So for $13. I got to see a pretty decent, 90 minute film....maybe I should have waited till it came to the $2. theater..................",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

A not-to-gloomy kind of super heroes movie.Unlike other super heroes movies (spiderman, batman, superman, ghost rider, and constantine), this movie is totally different. Not that I hate those movie, but I kinda hate a complicated and too gloomy movie plot, which sometimes, can ruin a good movie. But this movie, it's totally different. It's full with action, and comedy pack. The story itself is easy to understand.While for the effect, it's totally awesome. With effect that can challenge ""The Day After Tomorrow"", and story plot as light as ""Home Alone"", I really recommend this movie for those who wants a light hearted, action-comedy pack movie. This movie is definitely for you.I rate it. 10/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
218,Rayvyn,Two For Two!,3,18 September 2008,"Yep the Fantastic Four series is two for two. The first film was bad and this film is bad. Both are unwatchable a second time, hell I almost didn't make through the first time on this one. The movie is about as deep as a kitchen sink. The acting was average at best and the plot was dumb. It is sad to see such a great comic book series get made into such a bad movie. The special effects were the only thing that was good about it. They showed the Silver Surfer but they didn't show much of Galactus, just his equipment falling out of the sky. Maybe a slight glimpse of the man or being himself. Why can't Stan Lee sell the movies to the same guys who made Spiderman 1 & 2, Iron Man, Hulk and The Incredible Hulk? I'm tired of the garbage we're getting.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

But I really enjoyed this film altogether, this is another film that I was able to watch in the middle of the night at like 3 and I didn't even once nod or think about falling asleep. Overall I give this an 8 out of 10, the same as I gave the first one too because they are both great superhero movies and some sequels don't quite live up to the original but I have to say that this one definitely lived up to the original. I would recommend this to all action fans and of course to all fans of superheroes and marvel comic characters.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
220,rabrenner,Succeeds On Its Own Terms,7,3 July 2007,"Fantastic Four 2 is a much less ambitious film then Spiderman 3, but it succeeds better on its own, limited terms. Yes, the characters are two dimensional, the actors wooden, the jokes corny, the special effects mediocre. But Tim Story and co. manage to keep it moving/entertaining for 89 scant minutes. The only real disappointment is Galactus. In the comics, the big G is a God-like being beyond simple human concepts of good and evil; in the movie, he's (literally) a bag of gas.The most interesting aspect of the movie, from a cultural perspective, is the Abu Ghraib prison scandal reference. The Silver Surfer, having been captured by the FF, is ""interrogated"" (tortured) by the U.S. army! He isn't waterboarded or led around on a leash, but he is shackled to a table, injected with an unspecified drug, and given electrical shocks with a defibrillator. The FF are so incensed by his treatment that they bust him out of stir. It's a jarring contemporary intrusion into otherwise mindless escapist fare.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
221,jctundis,The Silver Surfer Soars!,8,26 June 2007,"I was lucky enough to get into a preview of FF:ROTSS a couple of weeks ago and like it quite a bit. Granted, it's over the top action and fun, but that's what FF always was to me. Dynamic movement, explosions and cosmic adventure. In many ways, I think this movie succeeded in ways that Spidey 3 failed - most importantly, the way it used multiple antagonists and tied them together. The film was never boring. The Silver Surfer looks amazing, and the voice is perfect!Certainly, this is a far better outing than the first Fantastic Four film, and I look forward to more. The cast have settled into these roles. The film also features Stan Lee's best cameo ever (a direct nod to the comics) and a few other surprises.So, like I said, not exactly brain surgery - but a fun film that, to me, embraced the spirit of the FF.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
222,ZekeRage911,"Better than the first, but that's not saying much",6,11 October 2007,"Let me get what I liked out of the way: The Surfer effects, Reed Richard's speech about being a 'good little nerd' and Jessica Alba's body. What I didn't like: Let me put it this way. Watch the movie all the way through. Then watch the beginning again. Notice something? Think about it. The Surfer was the one who stopped Galactus. The Surfer. Not the Fantastic Four, not Doc Doom, not anyone outside of the Galactus equation. This means that if the Surfer had just an ounce or more brains, he'd have killed his boss much earlier, and avoided the destruction of who knows how many planets. So the whole point of the events in the movie were to... make him change his mind? Even the original comic book had it slightly more complex than that. It took a little more than an encounter with human beings to change his mind. And while I, personally, would probably do a complete 180 if Jessica Alba was in front of me in skintight spandex, I still don't buy that Mr. Shiny from outer space is gonna go against the fate he's resigned himself to from what amounts to about an hour of conversation. Though, this time around Julian McMahon was a much better Dr. Doom than in the previous movie. This time, he actually seemed, I dunno, competent. And, because I have to mention it, the scene in the club was so worthless I actually had to leave the room and come back when it was over. Maybe the geeks in the CGI department thought a stretchy guy would have great moves on the dance floor, but for the love of all that's holy, any director, editor, or producer in their right mind would have cut that out faster than the Flash on crack. So while the dialogue was improved, and some of the actors appeared to have had some acting lessons, this movie is still pretty terrible. And understand my criticism, while harsh, is more than justified. I'm trying to be constructive. Some stuff can be worked with. Other stuff is just better off in the can. This movie, maybe, could have been worked with. Oh, and by the way, this is to Stan Lee. STOP APPEARING IN MARVEL MOVIES, PLEASE!! I actually felt a little ill at that scene.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
223,kaustubh-rajnish,Formoolah based Live Action Cartoon,6,5 October 2008,"The umpteen successful superhero movies have begun to have a formula in recent times. Show superheroes suffering from everyday mundane problems which common people face, throw in villains who are multidimensional and may not be always bad and create plenty of highflying fights with giant explosions and earth destruction.The rise of the silver surfer is no different The marriage of the century is on the hands Dr. Reed the stretchable man is marrying Susan the invisible woman except the ceremony is spoilt by a comet like object floating over earth which is freezing everything in its path through cosmic radiation.Apparently its here to devour the earth and suck its energy out. I wont waste time to explain the rest of the story as it's the usual fight between good versus evil with an old supposedly dead villain returning and the fantastic four characters (and not the franchise) coming of age Alba looks horrible and aged, its hard to imagine that she was considered the hottest starlet a couple of years ago. The torch is too cheeky for its own good and frankly bores us with college boy jokes. And Dr. Reed looks more like a worried father of two than a superhero. The thing -- does his part of grunting and looks like a mutated and gruff ninja turtle.Let's come to the point. The film is about CGI -- so silver surfer looks awesome as does the torch and a surprise form of it, which has powers of all four. The effects and the London eye scene get full points. The constant bickering between the four keeps u engaged but is forgettable. The film is your average pop corn entertainer which does not give you even enough time to enjoy a thrilling moment and yet you wont mind spending 90 minutes watching this live action cartoonfest.Recommended to people who are not yet bored of watching too many earth shattering special effects yarns with too little substance. But heed the warning CGI is slowly becoming a bit like live action cartoon and there is just too much of it rising up.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
224,paulmamak,A big improvement from the previous.,6,11 July 2007,"Overall this film was good, however like the last one it only ran for 1 hour and a half, which was put to fairly good use. However, if it ran for longer, a much stronger film would have resulted.The characters in this film I felt were better portrayed, for example Reed Richards and Sue Storm's relationship was more creative unlike the previous film. Johnny Storm, played by Chris Evans, had more depth other than just being a cocky jock. Whereas Ben Grimm, The Thing, had much less screen time unlike the other characters as I suppose more emphasis what put on him in the first film.What made the film was the Silver Surfer, it really took the franchise to the next level. The master of movement ""Doug Jones"", the voice of Laurence Fishburne and outstanding computer generation resulted in the perfect Silver Surfer. Every moment with this character on the screen made watching the film worthwhile, the only hold back was that not enough was seen of him. Considering the limited amount of screen time they did well to include all what was needed to know about the character. What wrecked the Silver Surfer's presence was the portrayal of Galactus as a cloud, who ever thought that up needs their knee caps broken. How can the Silver Surfer possibly relate to a cloud? Also before Galactus even made his presence known, he was destroyed by the Silver Surfer, if he really cared why did he not just do that in the first place?The action scenes also showed great improvement such as the helicopter crashing at the wedding, the chase between Johnny Storm and the Silver Surfer and the confrontation between Dr Doom and Johnny Storm. The action scene based in London, however, was far too Americanised, us Brits in that form of a crisis would have at least gave it more drama and the use of the London Eye falling seemed too much of a cliché.Dr Doom's presence could have also been longer.The next film should certainly bring back the Silver Surfer and increase the screen time.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
225,adudewhoiscool,Certainly an improvement over the first film,6,18 June 2007,"In 2005 ""Twentieth Century Fox"" released ""Fantastic Four"" to mixed to poor reviews. This reviewer, himself, also was quite disappointed. Now, in the summer of 2007, the sequel is up but is it an improvement over the first film? Well, the good news for you readers is that it is an improvement over the first film but by how much.Sometime after the first film, the fantastic four believe that life is back to normal. Reed Richards and Sue Storm plan to get married and the four are celebrities. Suddenly their plans are interrupted when the great Galactus plans to destroy planet Earth, by sending his henchman, the Silver Surfer, to the planet. The four have another problem to deal with too; their old enemy, Doctor Von Doom, is still alive and wants his revenge. With their own enemy back and their world in danger, can the fantastic four save the day? All of the fun aspects of the first film are in the sequel. The relationship between Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) still brings good comic relief. There is a bit more humor in this one as well. The special effects and action scenes are a lot better this time around. They really did not try to do anything more then just make it a quick 92 minute summer comic book movie. Keep your eyes out for the Stan Lee cameo too.The things the first one was lacking are improved in this one. This reviewer already talked about the better special effects and action scenes, as well as the humor and the Stan Lee cameo. Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) is back and was given a more menacing, less cheesy role. He is not at the point of where he should be but it was a lot better then the first film. Ioan Gruffudd did a much better job portraying Reed Richards, though he still suffers because of the bad chemistry between the love interest Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) and him.The real highlight is the Silver Surfer (aka Norrin Radd). The look and design of his is amazing. From the combination of Doug Jones in a motion capture suit, similar to Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and Lawrence Fishburne's voice, the Silver Surfer was everything you would have wanted. While this reviewer will admit that Lawrence Fishburne's voice sounded out of place in the beginning but by the time the film gets rolling you love the voice work. Some may complain that the Silver Surfer looked too much like the T-1000 from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" but the surfer looked exactly like he did from the comic book so there is no problem. The best scenes in the movie somehow involved the Silver Surfer. WETA really did do a great job bringing him to life. Now that the positives were discussed it is time for the negatives. Jessica Alba, whose only talent is her looks, is still a lousy actress. It is a weird to think that her character actually had more chemistry between her brother and her then with her own love interest. Another negative, and positive, was the humor. There is more humor but many of the jokes felt too forced, some of them worked and some of them did not. In addition, it took a little while, thirty minutes approximately, for things to get going and actually start picking up. Luckily once the action hit it never slowed down. For those major comic book fans, they do a huge butcher job to the Silver Surfer/ Galactus storyline. It bothered this reviewer a little but not as much as it could for the hardcore fans that grew up with it.In conclusion, if you are sick of those big epic movies that are over two and a half hours, like ""Spider-Man 3"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,"" you might want to check this one out. It is not the greatest movie you will see this summer but it is still a fun time and a big improvement over the first. Is it worth over $9 at the cinema? Well it depends on what you are looking for, but this reviewer got his $9 worth. ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is recommended!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
226,xgray-03873,"More like the ""Fall of the Silver Surfer""",1,27 April 2017,"I'm just really disappointed in this movie. This movie just goes to show you that 20th Century Fox just does not even care about the Fantastic Four franchise at all. I mean, the first film was kind of mediocre in my opinion, but the 2015 remake was just crap from the beginning. However, Rise of the Silver Surfer was a huge letdown from Dr. Doom getting his face back, to the final showdown and with the big reveal of ""G.I.N.O"" (Galactus In Name Only). Seriously, Tim Story, Fox....you have failed this franchise with this installment. And I really wish that Marvel should just buy the rights back so that they can actually make the characters more interesting to watch when they are interacting with the Avengers and other superheros and vigilantes like Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and Cloak and Dagger.Overall, I seriously do not recommend this movie to anyone at all. If you want a real ""Fantastic Four"" movie, go watch the Incredibles, instead. Or check out the 1994 version of the Fantastic Four movie. But, stay away from this movie.

This movie was like the third season of a popular show. You know, the first season sucks, then the second season starts to get on its feet and the third season rocks! As long as they keep their heads, FF:/// should be as good as Spiderman 3.There's an easy friendship and banter among the Four although Susan Storm getting naked isn't that cool any more. Okay, we've seen her, let's move on. Tip to scriptwriters of ""FF:3"", why not keep her clothes on...The weddings were a bit pitiful... why did they bother?

228,mcbrion,Fantastically Poor,1,31 May 2021,"As bad as it comes.Lets start with the cast. The only decent actor is the character of Ben Grimm. Alba is just...Alba. Wooden. Same for Gruffudd. And Evans is much better as Captain America. In this movie, he's just walking thru it. The Silver Surfer? Eh. For an alien, he's passable, but he doesn't ""act."" I guess that comes with being an alien. Dr. Doom? He glares, is treacherous, and wants to rule the world. Not too hard to play a pschopath and McMahon does do that. But it's not really acting of any decent calibre.Next up: Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds and an Entity in the Marvel Universe. In this movie? Galactus is a CLOUD. Why??? Whoever greenlighted this movie was unimaginative and bereft of common sense. Like the movie.An exasperating movie overall. None of the it makes any sense. I cannot imagine how any objective reviewer - unless it sheer fan-boy rock-'em, sock-'em types, could give this any more than a 4. I can't give it that, and I started reading the Fantastic Four in 1964 (yes, I'm THAT old!) But if you're just out for brainless entertainment, this'll do. Nowhere near as good as the comic book, but then, ALL the FF4 movies have poor screenplays. I hope one day they make a good one, but there have been two movies since this one, and the later cast was even worse. No hope for this franchise.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
229,eugenia_loli,*SOME spoilers*: Worse than the first movie,5,20 June 2007,"I did not like this movie. I found it worse than its predecessor. Evans was not as funny as in the first one, and the logic of the direction was terrible. For example, there you have Evans being able to exchange abilities with the others, and yet, on the next scene he is touching his sister without anything happening. Or, Victor also having been touched by the Surfer's power, and yet he could touch everyone and not switch powers.Or, when they are on the flying machine, without a protective glass, and going full speed, and not only they were able to shout at one another and get understood, but the amount of wind on the hair was minimal. How stupid was that? I did not like this movie. It was badly done, in the sense that there was no ATTENTION to detail. And the scenes felt rushed, like they were cut off too much in the editing room. In fact, some shots didn't even make sense: there you have Richards fighting and then immediately after he is with Susan. It just felt too cut-off.5/10 (I gave the first movie 6.5/10)",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
230,james.p.taylor,Meh.,6,15 June 2007,"Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer picks up where the previous outing finished. Finally getting married Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and Mr. Fantastic's (Ioan Gruffudd) wedding is interrupted by the arrival of the herald of the super villain Galactus into New York. The Silver Surfer may be the challenge to the Four that finally defeats them. Add to this the return of Von Doom and you've got a really tense situation.My biggest problem with the first film was the poor script and low rating (PG in the UK). The action is hamstrung by the inability at that rating to actually show anything. Here is a film with another poor script. A lot of the writers from the first were kept on and it shows, the same complaints I had with the first film are here again.Another problem is Gruffudd. He has an awful rabbit-in-the-headlights look on his face all the time. As the leader of the group he needs to have testicles and be a strong force. Unfortunately he is the wimpiest member of the group and seems to be permanently gawping at the things going on around him.Again Alba and Michael Chiklis (The Thing) are wasted. Alba showed great talent at times in the sadly cut short Dark Angel series. Her talent is currently being wasted by Hollywood, always seeming to want to slap her in either skin-tight rubber or in a bikini. Her make-up and hair in combination with the contacts make her look very alien and made me not want to connect with her. Chiklis should also be doing better. He's a great actor with an expressive face that's hidden behind a pile of prosthetics. Yes, he does get time without the make-up, but it isn't long enough. Chris Evens (Human Torch) is again just so-so.The best thing in the film is the Surfer. Physically acted by Doug Jones and voiced by Laurence Fishburne he shines through the rest of the duffness. There are a few good action scenes, but as I've said, the low rating prevents there being anything really meaty in them. At least the movie's only just over an hour and a half long. The chase with The Human Torch and the Surfer through the city is impressive, as is the confrontation between Von Doom and the Four.Don't bother seeing this at the cinema. Wait for the DVD and rent it. Hopefully that'll send a message that we don't want a third instalment that is probably unfortunately coming.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
231,l_cobern1989,Not great but better than the first,7,24 February 2008,The first fantastic four was OK but this 1 was a lot better. Although it were great it was better than the first. You saw more action than you did in the last one and you got to see the fantastic four use their powers more. The CGI was brilliant and made the end fight scene look brilliant. I think for this one they wanted to focus more on the action rather than story telling because in the it was mainly all about that and not much action to see which was fairly disappointing but this one made up for it with the action. I didn't think Jessica Abla was very good playing her role as the invisible women just like the first one. Also in the film it was quite funny at times just like the first one. I thought the script wasn't to good and they could of done better with that.I thought this film was enjoyable to watch. my expectations weren't really running high but it was very enjoyable. If you like the first one and are a fan of fantastic four there i'm sure you will enjoy this. But if you didn't like the first you will probably not like this.,Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
232,stefrance99,"Not good, but not totally bad either",5,28 August 2007,"Improved compared to the 1st one, which to be honest wasn't difficult at all. So rather than good points I would say less bad points. 1) If you don't know the comic you will enjoy it more, if you do, probably not 2) Acting was better and bit more credible 3) Special effects cool but not breathtaking, but the case is worth it 4) Interesting idea to represent Galactus more like a moving Black Cloud/Hole, making him even humongous size human as in the comic would have made it unrealisticNot good points 1) What the Hell with the Silver Surfer destroying (suposedly) Galactus 2) The surfer is too human 3) The battle against Dr Doom is yet again an anti-climaxAnd just for the note, as I'm really tired of ""Cliche"" in movies why put a Chinese Music with a background and people dressed in Japanese Kimono. How can people be educated when you see this kind of sad cliché, kind of, they are all Yellow and that's the same. If bother to have people speak Japanese, dress in traditional Kimono and act like Japanese why the Hell put a Chinese music with that. After that people don't understand why kids have no general knowledge...",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
233,meako1973,This is what comic-book movies should be like!,10,14 June 2007,"The first Fantastic Four film was met with a slew of negative reviews from the entertainment press. Not that any of that stopped audiences flocking to see the exploits of the much-loved Marvel family. Audiences lapped up the family friendly antics of the four, and this lit the way for a sequel to follow.For the sequel all the core cast return - Jessica Alba as Susan Storm, Iaon Grufford as Reed Richards, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm - as the team of heroes with cosmic powers. As The Invisible Woman, Mr Fantastic, The Human Torch, and The Thing respectably the four have now settled into their high-profile super-lives, although it has meant a few problems for them at times. One such problem is the many attempts by Reed and Sue to get married - always put on hold as another world-wide emergency strikes. As the film starts (with a teasing pre credit sequence of a planet being sucked dry of it's energy and a silvery streak shooting away from it towards earth) the family of four are preparing for the big day once more. Even as strange events strike around the world, Reed focuses his main attentions towards the big day. Unfortunately it is on the big day itself that things come to a head and the Silver Surfer makes his presence known. His motivations for the disturbances he causes are unknown, but it seems to have something to do with a strange energy cloud that is devouring planets. Can the four save the day once more, and what is the sinister Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) - mysteriously escaped from his statuesque cocoon - up to? The first film, as enjoyable as it was (I'm a huge fan of the four) did suffer from the occasionally glitched effects, and the troubles with being an origin story. The cast didn't quite find their feet in that film. This time around things are much improved! The cast are so comfortable in their roles, and the interplay between the four is spot on throughout. The wit and charm, and the conflicts are all present, correct, and this time natural. This IS the four from the pages of the comics, represented as good as you could hope for. The action is ramped up this time also. With the origin out of the way, the plot can just zip along from set piece to set piece with great momentum. The effects - this time provided by Weta Digital - are much more polished than last time, and the key sequences (such as the London Eye disaster) are jaw dropping and exciting.Much praise must be laid to Tim Story who once more proves he is the right man for the job of director, and also shows his passion for the comics. The action is fun and glorious, and the characters are allowed to breath - even more impressive given the short 90 minutes running time. The film is paced and edited beautifully, never feeling rushed whilst also never feeling bogged down. Perhaps a lesson can be learned by other super-hero directors that they don't have to make epic-length films.As for Galactus (which many fan-boys have already made their minds up about) - as a huge (read: lifetime) fan of the Four I was more than pleased with the representation of the big G. It works cinematically without actually showing the 'core' essence in the cloud.All of this without even mentioning the new 'star' of the film, the Silver Sufer. Beautifully portrayed, and given the heart that the character needed to be given, fans of the Surfer will be more than happy (and here's hoping for a Surfer movie next).This is what comic book movies are all about, and which the whole family can enjoy together. FF:ROTSS is the best super-hero flick of this year! In addition - Stan Lee spotters can't miss him this time around as he shows up as himself!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
234,ethanrunt,Can the 4 once again prove their worth?,8,12 June 2007,"From the start it seems like Superman Returns. A planet blows up, credits. and the film isn't even called Fantastic 4: insert subtitle here, but merely 4: insert. Does this mean they aren't fantastic anymore? It'd appear so.From the get go on earth the team are like modern day Paris Hiltons, everything about their life is in the papers, and paparazzi are just overpowering the wedding of Sue and Reed, causing problems even for our beloved Stan Lee in his finest cameo, comedic wise at last, and at least it's not cheesy, i mean, 'Amazing how one man really can make a difference"" ? But, not to spoil the brilliance for anyone, the movie, as stated everywhere in the build up, is all about the awesome action in the film. Yeah, OK, that may be, but mixing awesome action with CGI that looks remotely realistic wouldn't go amiss, i know it's a comic book, but it's not a cartoon adaptation, real people don't look or plastic-esquire you know!Gripes apart, and there is one other that pops up later, the film is a testament to the belief that the last one was good but not enough. More comedy, more action and less of the plot problems, rather they add a new character, they work as a team, and Doom comes back and just as quickly turns on everyone in what can only be described as the moment the makers were hoping would make the film a PG-13 in America for reputation, unlucky guys, apparently.Going from London to China to Japan, i think, and Germany, and just in New York, where the Baxter Building's roof now has glass on the top in the shape of their logo :) It's dizzying, and a little too fast, when in all they could have gotten it done slower with more breathing space between random action that rots your brain until you go, oh, it's almost over, but wait, they have to wrap it up, come on, okay, that's it, yep, oh, you aren't going to die? Damn, my smile has dissappeared from my face.See, spoiling without spoiling, me so clever. The acting is average, Alba really annoying with them glasses randomly, and just not being great, she never is, but Evans and Chiklis showing great chemistry once again as everyone's favourites, and even more a-fussin' and a-feudin'.On top of that, add the grandiose 4plane, the great Doug Jones doing what he does best, take that you motion capture wuss Serkis Jones knows how to not be human, unless the Pale Man really is what he is like... And Lawrence Fishburne adds deep bass and humanoid-ity to the Surfer, who, considering i never liked him, kind of showed me his worth, and although the film should be called Silver Surfer meets the Fantastic Four, as it's more his movie than their's, especially the final battle, the film keeps it's tone high, take that darker sequels, yes Spidey, AWE and X3! funny, silly, and despite poor graphics in some bits, and annoying moments including bad pacing, the film is just as good as the original, and shows promise once again that the next Fantastic Four could be a little longer and a lot less about Sue... 8/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
235,DerBarenJude,Very good! Much better than the original.,6,20 June 2007,"I didn't think much of the original FF, but this one is far better in every aspect. Better writing, more exciting storyline, and better acting, as well. The special effects are amazing, as everyone can probably already tell from the previews, particularly the Silver Surfer. His scenes were incredible.I laughed quite a bit at this movie, surprisingly, as I didn't find the last one very funny. The humor in this movie was a little more mature, particularly when Johnny Storm is asking Ben Grimm about how he and his girlfriend have ""relations (which is something I always wondered as well)."" My favorite scenes were the ones in which Ben and Johnny interacted, as Michael Chiklis' Thing is my favorite character to watch. He really captured the spirit of the comic in both appearance and attitude.There are many things to like about FF: ROSS, just don't expect Shakespeare, or even deep comic book movies like Batman Begins or X-Men. This movie is rated PG, and rightfully so. While there are mature moments, FF is at heart a movie for younger people.The reason that I gave this movie a 6, despite my seemingly high praise of it, is the ending/last 15-20 minutes. While not enough to ruin my enjoyment of this movie, the ending definitely rubbed me the wrong way, particularly as a comic book fan. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't go into detail. But it's easy to see how the producers painted themselves into a corner by needing an easy way to finish a movie that could potentially have an extremely vast scope.Bottom line: if you're a FF fan, or just a comic book fan in general, this is one that you won't want to miss. Just, like I said, don't go in expecting to think deep thoughts.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
236,Lord_Crypto,Most Disappointing Comic Book Film Ever,5,1 July 2007,"This film had so much potential. In my opinion, it could have been one of the best comic book films of all time. You have one of the greatest Super-hero groups, The Fantastic Four. One of the coolest comic book characters, The Silver Surfer. And most people know what the Silver Surfer is a precursor to, (Spoiler Avoiders: Turn Back Now!). Yes, Galactus is in this film and I am just speechless with his character. This movie could have been so much better.First, the acting. Ioan Gruffud does yet again nothing as Mr. Fantastic. His performance is mediocre and the same with Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom and Jessica Alba as Susan Storm. Their performances did not change any from the first one. Chris Evans does a fairly good job in this film as a reckless and arrogant Johnny Storm. I liked the evolution of his character in this film from the last one! He is learning to become more responsible and we are seeing that character transition but he still has some reckless and self-impressive characteristics! Good story with Johnny Storm! Michael Chiklis is still good as the Thing but I feel his character is underused in the film.Laurence Fishburne is the highlight of the film! He is a perfect voice for the Silver Surfer! The Silver Surfer character is amazing. An absolute thrill to watch! His qualities, characteristics, and powers are stunning! I love watching him fight! His character is very good although I do not think we get enough back story of him and his powers. Excellent portrayal of the Silver Surfer though.The story is OK, the suspense of the film really got me on the edge. But the movie disappoints in that it builds more and more to a climatic point that is just completely mediocre. First, the surfer comes and starts making unknown phenomena occurring. Than, he tells Dr. Doom all he knows is at an end. Than, he tells Susan he has no choice and what is going to happen can't be stopped. Than, he tells Susan once he is captured that Galactus is coming. Than, we meet Frankie Rye. In the comics, she is a character who later sacrificed herself to become a herald to Galactus. Notice, The movie is building up more and more with little details/quotes hinting on some big event coming up with Galactus. Than, we see what looks like a silhouette of Galactus' helmet on Saturn (I think). And it comes down to the Surfer confronting Galactus, which is only what seems like a black hole and the surfer blows them both up!!! Thats it! No big Surfer/F.F. vs. Galactus showdown; The surfer draws up his power and blows up Galactus. That is not much of a climatic finish. After watching the trailers and seeing the Surfer, I was expecting some big battles with him and the F.F. but there was none except the chase scene with The Surfer and the Torch. The film set it up for some big pinnacle and never reached it.Galactus' character is terrible. He is apparently a black-hole! That is it. He is no living being or elemental force of the cosmos! And it seems as if the Surfer is the source of his own power! His power comes from his board and we learn nothing about how he acquired his powers! It can only be assumed that The Surfer had his own powers and his silvery nature is his own physical characteristic. Not that Galactus gave him his powers. There seem to be too many questions unresolved about the Surfers powers, how he got them, and the powers of Galactus.One simple word can describe this film, disappointing! I was more excited for this film than Spider-man 3 and I had high expectations for it that were not meant. Just a disappointing and poor movie!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
237,djray65,Surfing on to the silver screen,7,13 November 2007,"The latest installment of comic book super heroes to jump from ink to the big screen is another big budget action fest. This time out, we find the Fantastic 4 fighting an alien invader, the Silver Surfer. The special effects are no less then great. The story is better then I would have expected from this popcorn film. While it is no citizen Kane, it did do its job; it held my interest and entertained me for 90 plus minutes. I'm not a super big fan on the comic book; I did read it from time to time as a teenager. I can't say if they are being true to the original or not. But if Stan Lee is willing to put his stamp of approval on it, that is good enough for me. Plus I'm not one of those super nerds that has never seen a woman naked so it was OK. Well, here it is; the bad news. The main down fall is the acting. While not all the performances came up short, Michael Chiklis is great as the thing as is most of the cast. The weak link in the acting chain is Ms. Jessica Alba. Like the rest of the red blooded American male population, I think she is super hot. That said; I have to say she can't act her way out of a bad soap opera. I think in whatever movie she is in next; she should play a mute in a bikini. She is great to look at, but once she opens her mouth to say any thing it obliterates the illusion. All said; I have to give this film two thumbs up. It was what a pop corn movie should be, entertaining. If you want to lose your self for a little while this is the movie to do it with. I hope the next installment is as action packed, and maybe they'll write fewer lines for Ms. Alba to stumble over.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
238,landryt,"Fantastic, is the only way to put it",9,15 June 2007,"Let's start out by saying that fantastic four 2 is much better than it's predecessor. Better story, better acting, great new character, and great humor.Story- The Silver Surfer comes to Earth to destroy it because his ruler Galactus has to feed off of other planet's destruction. This story actually worked very well, i liked how the surfer was mainly doing it without thinking about it, towards the end, Susan convinces him that it isn't right and the Surfer tells Galactus that he will no longer serve him, and leading on to the ending.Acting-Mr. Fantastic: ehh, he was the weaker of the four, some scenes he didn't look like he was totally into it. Invisible Woman: A tad better, some scenes she was absolutely superb, and others.....Human Torch: In my opinion he was the best of the whole bunch, his humor was flat out hilarious, and when he needed to be serious, he could be serious. The Thing: About the same as the first film, not bad, but not perfect, some times you coulden't understand him too well,but other than that he was fine.Characters- Silver Surfer was amazing, he looked great, and was just a really cool character to watch. Doctor Doom was Iffy, In my honest opinion, he shoulden't have been in the film at all, he just wasn't needed, i would have loved to see them fight it off with Galactus.Ending- Doesn't give away anything, but leaves you wanting more and knowing that there will be a sequel, and the Silver Surfer will be sure to be in it.9 out of 10 stars",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
239,vlaukin,Not the best of this Summer...,6,3 July 2007,"First off I want to say that I found Spider Man 3 a much more enjoyable movie going experience. The highlight of the Fantastic Four 2 was definitely the Silver Surfer. The story line seemed pretty solid, but there were weaknesses and these centered around the Doom character. I just didn't buy into it or it wasn't done with enough clarity or purpose and unfortunately it just made the movie weaker. Jessica Alba looked terrible in the first half of the movie but that did improve. I loved the Torch in the first movie and that attitude, for the most part, carried over into the second. But even then it wasn't as good and again, it was the surfer that pretty much stole the show. Mr Fantastic had the most dominant role and that came through very well in this movie.This could have been better, but it was still worth seeing. It's a short film with some rushed, spotty plot line and I have to wonder what was wrong with Abla in the first few scenes, weird. JD",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
240,tonysharp,Did anyone read the script?,4,20 August 2007,"This movie was so stupid and so predictable... I wish I could just forget about it and move on, but I promised myself I would write a review for all of the movies I've given a rating to. Anyhow.I don't even know where to begin. The love story was a big typical cake covered in annoying frosting, Jessica Alba gives one of her worse performances ever, and Laurence Fishburne was poorly cast as the Silver Surfer. His voice just didn't match the icy look of the Silver Surfer. I could have sounded more menacing.The only thing that held my interest completely was the ending, but thats probably because most of the money from the budget went there. I have a soft spot for giant scenes with a lot of special effects. What can I say.But other than a few moments of tasty eye candy, there isn't much good about this movie.If you want to see a good comic book flick, check out Batman Begins. Its the best comic book movie I've ever seen. Silver Surfer is an unfunny joke in comparison.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

243,SonicBoom77,Not a great movie but at least it's enjoyable,6,19 November 2007,The Fantastic Four are back the following sequel to the first Fantastic Four this time there back in Fantastic Four Rise of The Silver Surfer witch is more fun then the first but still not great The most happiest thing about this Fantastic Four is that Director Tim Story boosted up the action witch was a major flaw in the first the story seems to progress much faster and the characters seem more interesting the story lines seem to be much similar to other 2nd super hero films such as wanted to give up and quite the team much like we seen the hero's quiting in Spider-Man 2 and Superman 2 but this film doesn't quite get anywhere or really get serious with that storyline the main story line is the Silver Surfer a famous character in the marvel comics keeps us not knowing if he's a good guy or a bad guy in the film we think he's the bad guy but we see towards the end of the film he doesn't want to but he's just summand to earth by his leader Galactus who many believe is a giant storm cloud as a comic boom fan myself i am very disappointed with Galactus witch is probably the biggest and most disappointing flaw of the whole film but then again they prolly never had the budget to create him. We also see in this film the return of Dr. Doom who helps reed and the army capture surfer but again turns against them Dr. Doom's look as improved over the first at least this time the mask fits the actors head the special effects and cgi in the film is well done in the most parts of the film.Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is a dull film only kids will think is smart but it however a enjoyable popcorn action superhero film that comic book fans shouldn't take seriously but just enjoy.6/10,Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

245,andydreamseeker,Movie Review: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,6,14 June 2007,"When the trailer is better than the movie, what does it says about the movie? That is how Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer turns out to be. I'm going to be wicked. The filmmakers should rename the sequel to 2005's Fantastic Four to Plastic Flaw: Fall of the Silver Surfer.The hardest review to write is having nothing good to write about. So if you, the reader expect any good here then you may be disappointed. There could be a couple of things good but mostly there are more, I shouldn't say bad, but just not good.I really liked how the Silver Surfer looks in the movie but it is just that for a film based on the comic-book genre, it is awfully thin. (Comic books may be thin in physical appearance but they are usually big on ideas and graphics) When I say thin, I'm thinking three things, the script, the CGI (except the Silver Surfer) and Jessica Alba.I liked 2005's Fantastic Four despite it being critically bombarded by many reviewers. It is at least entertaining and I could relate to the feelings of each Fantastic Four characters. This sequel however gave nothing valuable for the price of an entry ticket.What happened? I needed some answers. Let us check what shuffling was done in the production shall we?A check on the crew list reflected a change in the personnel that did the screenplay. Mark Frost and Michael France who did the screenplay in the first film were no longer there. Actually it was only Michael France who was missing. The two of them gave Fantastic Four some very interesting and fun dialogues that a comic-book genre movie needs. That part is not apparent in Rise of the Silver Surfer. The screenplay turned out to be bland, uninspiring and mostly uninteresting. It was hardly moving and nobody's even laughing at the funnier scenes.Mark Frost and Don Payne did the screenplay instead. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is loosely adapted from the stories in the original comic book. And according to Don Payne, the story in the film is based on Fantastic Four #48, where Galactus makes an appearance and #57-60 where Doctor Doom steals the Silver Surfer's powers.Mark Frost was also the one who wrote the story and it was OK. Why does the film need a storywriter? Isn't it based on the Marvel comic book? Lest you forget, a film still needs to be written so it can be played out on the big screen.If you're not a comic book fan or if you had not read Fantastic Four then you should be as clueless as I am. As good as the Silver Surfer looks with that chrome body of his that is all so cool, the movie did not tell us who he really is except that he was once named Norrin Radd and he works for something or someone known as Galactus, who or what looks like a cosmic storm cloud and is said to be a devourer of planets.I cannot imagine what the fans will think of this film. I can only guess they will be disappointed.If you had read this far then I think you are interested to find out more so here goes and I'll lead you into the film.The movie begins with the Silver Surfer flying away from an exploding planet and into earth. Bursting through the air space in various parts of earth, he caused a climatic shift that sees snow fall in Egypt. Large craters then appears and it was found that every planet that the Silver Surfer goes, it dies in eight days.Meanwhile the Fantastic Four has gotten used to their extraordinary lives with the Human Torch (Chris Evans) seemingly enjoying much of the limelight. The Thing (Michael Chiklis) having found love with the blind Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington) after his wife left him because of his hideous looks is looking OK. Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffuld) and Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are getting married. Everything is looking all right until the Silver Surfer arrives and mess up their lives again.Quarreling and fighting, the team of four with their diverse persona will come clashing with one another. Underneath their appearance is another layer of skin that cannot be seen with the eyes. That part needs to be understood by those who care. Who are they?With the earth's existence threatened, the team of four needs to work out their differences to save the world. Things are not helped by the return of power hungry Victor or Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon), the villain from the first film who has escaped his captivity in Latveria. Evil as he is, he has a different agenda although first appearing to be helpful.How can the Fantastic Four save earth from a force so powerful that devours cosmic planets? Look to the title of this film for the answer.The plot is interesting isn't it? I thought so too. But if you refer to the top, I changed the name of the movie. Plastic Flaw because even as a film that relies on CGI and special effects as its selling points, it is flawed in appearance. Everything except for the Silver Surfer looks only superficial and adds nothing new to what we had already seen before. And Fall of the Silver Surfer because the Silver Surfer fell off his board quite literally just as the movie did.Watch if you're a fan because surely you will. And watch if you've got 90 minutes to kill. But if it is an entertaining, inspiring and fantastic movie you're looking for then you'll need to look elsewhere.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is not fantastic, just ordinary.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
246,antipas2000,"fantastic four? So far, these films are not giving these characters credit",5,4 July 2007,"firstly, I agree with a few comments I have read saying the silver surfer deserves better. The surfer was not given as much credit as he should have. Of course, fans of the Fantastic Four will know what it means when the Silver Surfer comes along (hint hint) but not enough respect to such a character was made. So far, I have not been impressed at all with any of the two films, neither the first or the sequel. As comics to films go, so far Fantastic Four has to be one of the worst for holding the attention. Of course, we are always rewarded at some point at the end of the film, but I was nearly ready to fall asleep at a few points! I sat wide awake through all the relationship and talk dribble of Spider-man 3 for Christ's sake. And this film is worse than worse. You would do better to read the good comics (or even the cartoon series!) Of course, it is nice seeing these comic characters being brought to the big screen and seeing them in action, but this film did not deliver on what I was expecting, or what I thought it was going to be.I give it 5/10 very average. But I would not purchase it on DVD. If I was you, do not even pay to go and see it at the cinema. Maybe rent it someday for a quiet weekend.

This movie was no exception, good graphics and pretty colors as another guy here said. Unfortunately, the moment the special effects kicked in the world of the movies, the good old script got a good kick in the nuts and can barely stand now let alone hold a whole movie on it's feet. This movie again, it's no exception. I have to admit, the plot was OK, the lines good, there was humor, romance, action, a reasonable balance to everything. Yet, I could not feel it taking me in; I remained a spectator, while the short dialogs even though containing the essence of the story, were still dry and well, short.

250,fritzgagi,Fantastic midnight snack.,6,4 February 2012,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is like a small but tasty snack. You feel satisfied but not glutted. You had fun but nothing world-shattering has happened.Speaking of world-shattering: mysterious incidents are happening all over the world. A muscular iron-man on a silver surfboard (hence the title) visits earth, while the fantastic couple Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are preparing their wedding, but the bride and groom have to postpone it because the world once again has to be saved.This comic adaptation from Marvel is a fast-paced, fun packed action movie. It's not ashamed to set up a somewhat insane plot and let the superheroes do their campy deed. While the humor does sometimes fall flat and the actors don't have to do more than deliver their (arguably not very-well written) jokes and superhero quirks it's still a very enjoyable one, that's definitely worth watching.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
251,mrohlee,Big Disappointment,3,5 October 2007,"The Silver Surfer coming to Earth is one of the classic comic stories. It was one of my favorite stories and the way it was butchered in this movie really bothers me. If you didn't know the story you might like the movie better, it's hard for me to say. In the classic Stan Lee-Jack Kirby comic, the Silver Surfer arrives and over the course of the comic tells his story. Galactus is an ancient super powerful creature who needs energy to survive. To the extent he consumes the energy of an entire world. He arrived at a world where people had become jaded and only one person went to meet him. This person impressed Galactus and promised to go out and find other worlds if Galactus would spare his. Galactus agreed and turned him into the Silver Surfer. The Surfer returns to say good bye to his wife/lover and leaves forever. He condemns himself to a lonely existence to save her. When he arrives at Earth he had been looking for a suitable planet for a long time. Galactus needs to feed, there is no time to find another planet. The Surfer had made a point of finding worlds with no intelligent life but has no options. He condemns the Earth to save his home world. The Fanatasic Four fight Galactus and the Surfer, convinced by Alicia (Ben's girlfriend) he joins with them and they drive off Galactus who takes his revenge by forcing the Surfer to remain on Earth.In another story Dr Doom steals the powers of the stranded Surfer. In this movie rather than spending time developing the character of the Surfer they decided to combine both stories, and cut Galactus completely out of the picture. They took 2 good stories and by smashing them together and then adding in some comedy and the wedding of Reed and Sue created a complete mess. Whey don't they trust the material, why did they feel the need to cram 3 movies worth of stories into one? If they don't like the material why not create a new story?So this truncated/corrupt version has some nice special effects but I didn't think the Surfer was particularly well done as a CGI. And Galactus is turned into a dust cloud? What a let down. It killed the whole series for me. I just wish they would let someone who liked the comics actually make the movie.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
252,mewmewmint-1,This was so lame.,1,10 September 2007,"Crummy acting, crap dialogue, and comic inaccuracy. A kid in kindergarten could've made up a better story. This movie sucked from every aspect. Watching Alba doing her mime push was just so lame... ""I'm a sthooper hero!"" I'm sorry but Alba can't act her way out of a paper bag.Main gripe is that Galactus didn't look like Galactus and he died waaaaaaay too easily. The writers of this obviously didn't even glance at the comics... though it's hard to believe Stan Lee would have signed off on this load of crap. He's f-ing Galactus! He's WAAAAAY stronger than the Surfer... and he's killed by an explosion that doesn't even wipe the Surfer out for good? What the f*** is this??! And don't you think the Surfer is moral enough to do this as soon as he learns of his true identity? The Surfer isn't so selfish that he would put his life before countless others. This show was so f-ing LAME!!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Many have been crazy about Silver Sufer and the return of Dr Doom. Yeah, Dr Doom!!! And I'm sure many would be looking forward to seeing Jessica Alba in a skin tight suit again.Story goes like this, Silver Sufer comes to Earth to scout and Fantistic 4 must stop him. But the Silver Sufer is too powerful. So they must team up with Dr Doom to stop him.Simple story, simple script, breath-taking special effect, Mavel jokes, Stan Lee Camoe, Dr Doom, good action and an almost naked Jessica Alba.

254,deamond9,Disappointing,3,22 July 2007,"SPOILER ALERT If you could make a movie about Galactus, the biggest and most powerful villain in Marvel mythos, a being capable of actually consuming planets, What would you do? What sorts of cool shots would you do? Well, I for one would actually HAVE HIM IN THE MOVIE. This is like having the hypothetical concept of King Kong alluded to for 90 minutes rather than actually having a giant monkey grab Fae Wray. It's like making a Godzilla movie shot from the point of view of people in the suburbs of New York reading in the Newspaper about Godzilla.Suposedly, some studio exec didn't want Galactus in the movie because that would be ""silly"" as opposed to a guy made of rock or Jessica Alba with blue eyes. I'm sorry; Galactus I believe, but Jessica Alba with blue eyes does NOT make any sense. She just looks weird.Now, the scene where Johnny Storm and the Thing switch powers, I have trouble believing that Johnny would be that vein or have such little pity for Ben.Also, I read another review that said ""it was nothing but sexist jokes at Jessica Alba's expense"" There was one! The other problem with The Thing and Johnny Storm switching powers is, the whole point of the character is that he's the first super-hero who actually hates being a super-hero. That's his character. He doesn't WANT to be The Thing, he wants to be human, that's the tragedy of the character. But if he keep being given the opportunity to become human, especially of he gets there, but changes his mind ""for the good of the team"", that just seems like bad TV writing.And Dr. Doom; Why did they heal him? They should've left him ugly. Like he is in the comics. Why did they magically heal him? There's just... there's no reason to do that. Without any make-up or mask, he just looks like he does on Charmed. So? And having him steal the Board, there's two possible purposes for that; either they're making a Silver Doom toy (wouldn't be surprised if there's one on ebay as I type this) or they were trying to replace the fact that they turned the biggest villain ever into a cloud.And; what are the holes for? the hones sort of make sense in the Silver Surfer cartoon, Galactus has a giant machine with tentacles. But in the movie, Galactus is a cloud, and no explanation is given as to the holes.However, the Silver Surfer himself was good. I bought him as an alien. The Silver Surfer is about the only thing in the movie that didn't suck.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
255,GloriousGooner,Awful Mess of a Movie,2,23 February 2010,"This film is awful. I hoped it was going to be merely OK, but this is truly dire. Firstly we spend the first 20 minutes only seeing flashes of the surfer with no explanation of who he is where he came from or why. Holes appear all over the planet, eventually Mr Fantastic works out he can predict where these holes are going to be dug which means they can catch him. No one explains why the holes are being dug. Then they catch him. Then the bad guy from the first film goes AWOL with the board while Galactus arrives in a cloud of fuzzy, bad, CGI. Again, Galactus gets a one sentence explanation. When we see it/him, it/he looks like the all-seeing-eye from TLOTR, minus the eye. The world survives, because having trashed countless worlds the surfer discovers people care for each other (no other planet displayed this habit?). The surfer saves us by destroying Galactus, which leads one to wonder why he didn't just do that in the first place saving himself and most of the universe an awful lot of bother.Films like this should spend more on CGI and less on acting. They should cut to the action and do away with emotion. Go with what works and ditch what doesn't but ROTSS doesn't, and fails.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
256,JustStone,All I ask for is gigantic godlike purple and blue planet destroyer,6,8 April 2010,"No Galactus? I mean c'mon. I sat through a movie for an hour and a half, waiting for an awesome gigantic godlike purple and blue planet destroyer, and all I get is a big CGI cloud? Shenanigans I say, shenanigans. Whatever, this movie is ten times better than Ghost Rider, Punisher and dare I say Spider Man 3? Well I think so. The cool thing about director Tim Story is that he actually reads comic books, so he might have actually had some insight on how a comic book can be translated to film rather than pretending like he does (ahhmmm Mark Steven Johnson). Regardless this movie is both entertaining and funny (like the comic) and it actually tells the story of the Silver Surfer pretty well. My only complaint is that we didn't see enough planet devouring; the best part of Galactus is watching him traverse the cosmos endlessly in eternal conquest to relinquish his unfathomable hunger that must be quenched by feeding on energy rich planets with his colossal death machine draining all life energy from each unwilling planet mercilessly killing billions of extra terrestrial beings & causing unimaginable suffering in the Universe.....especially if you're high. But I wasn't, cause I don't do that crazy stuff",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
257,freebird-64,Craptastic,3,13 June 2007,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer continues Marvel's losing streak of crappy movies (Daredevil, Electra, Ghost Rider, anyone?). This latest monstrosity seems to indicate that Marvel lucked out in landing Sam Raimi and Bryan Singer to helm their Spider-man and X-Men franchises but otherwise are as clueless as any of the suits in Hollywood as to how to adapt their characters to the big screen.Mistake one was hiring Tim Story. Although he did succeed in finally bringing the Fantastic Four to the screen after years of false starts, he also interpreted the material as a situation comedy featuring a bickering family who just happen to be superheroes instead of a group of superheroes who eventually become a family.Thus, he wastes screen time on the endless bickering between Sue Storm and Reed Richards over their umteenth postponed wedding. Sorry, but Jessica Alba and Iowan Gruffyd are not exactly Hepburn and Tracy. He also wastes his special effects budget on a corny sub-plot in which Johnny's encounter with the Surfer results in their switching powers (which of course means that Jessica Alba gets naked but, too bad, this movie is rated PG).By making time for all this sitcom material, Story shortchanges the main story regarding the Silver Surfer and his mission on Earth. The Surfer just seems to fly around wreaking havoc but basically doing nothing to prepare the way for the coming of Galactus, Then when he's interrogated he reveals that his board is a homing device that will draw Galactus, and he really doesn't need to do anything else. Duh.The reportedly increased budget (the movie is said to have cost $130 million) doesn't show on the screen. The Thing, in particular, looks awful and unbelievable. He also gets little to do apart from grumble in the background and dab his teary li'l eyes at yet another Sue-Reed wedding attempt. The bulk of the FX budget seems to have gone to realizing the Silver Surfer, which admittedly looks impressive.The film also wants to harp on a ""we are family""-type theme, but then what happens during the big climax? Instead of fighting as a team, Johnny absorbs the powers of the rest of his teammates and fights Dr. Doom alone. Double duh.Still, Michael Chiklis as The Thing and Chris Evans as the Human Torch do succeed in engendering some good will as they successfully embody their characters. But the film is a failure on virtually every other level, and another black-eye for Marvel.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
258,alexis_240,Painfully dumb and cliché,1,30 June 2007,"When Kevin Smith spoofed scream in Jay and silent Bob strike back he was right to add the line ""You guys are not even trying anymore"" which is probably the case in this movie. It's just another superhero flick filled with overly familiar clichés that are effortlessly avoidable. It's all here, the couple doubting about whether they should bring up kids in this ""superhero world"" and eventually decide(Storm and Richards that is) to leave everything behind and naturally somebody overhears them and we get the ""they don't care"" kind of atmosphere while the movie subconsciously prepares us for the ending scene where they have a change of heart not because that's the right thing to do but because this is a childish superhero movie and kids must not be disappointed (in other words the happier the ending the more money the studio is going to make)I had every intention of liking it but it's simply too lame a film to be liked. Since it starts with a wedding that gets interrupted it just has to end with the wedding's completion which makes the film even more predictable. The silver surfer on the other hand (well designed I'll give you that) protects Miss Alba because she reminds him of someone he used to love. How sad, I was reaching for the tissues when I heard that, the typical love interest that, for some incomprehensible reason every action flick has to have. Again this is the result of a lack of creative effort.The ending is no better either. A stake is thrown at Richards and Storm, in a very altruistic manner (strange that only action movie characters are that altruistic) stands in front of him and gets stabbed herself, oh come on this is such a tear jerker since we all know she won't die (No Alba is too damn hot to get killed on screen). Her powers even prevent her from bleeding (not really, but realism has been given up in favor of a younger audience). The surfer heals her and utters the film's incredibly stupid punchline ""You always have a choice"" no s**t. Pretty much like what Paris Hilton said to Larry King ""There are more important things in life than partying"" again no s**t.So Storm is fine and the team of 4 are back together and agree that they can't run away from their responsibilities. Remember the first Spiderman and how brilliantly it made this point? ""With great power comes great responsibility"", well this version of it is lamely written and terribly acted, just because you are a hottie Miss Alba it doesn't mean that you can get away with bad acting, go get some lessons.And we now arrive at what I personally find the single stupidest sequence to ever appear in a major production. The wedding is taking place and the team receives a message about Venice...sinking into the Adriatic, that's a biggie remarks the thing. I got a good one how about earth about to crash into the f*****g moon? It's both stupid and biggie. Really what will they think of next? I know this is a comic book flick but that doesn't mean that we have to turn our brain off when we watch it.Anyway they get on their super car which will take them to their nonsensical biggie and are greeted off with cheers.

262,kctotal,"It's Not Flawless, but is a Triumph Over the Original",8,1 July 2007,"In a summer in which each sequel has proved to be disappointing and less stunning than its predecessors, Silver Surfer is like a ray of hope. Spiderman may have drawn the crowd, but its intense marketing left fans and others viewers expecting more. Surfer on the other hand has been an underdog story. With little yet sufficient marketing campaigns, FF2 may truly be the sleeper hit of the summer.At the beginning of the film we find luckless Sue and Reed trying to tie the knot when a mysterious force ruins their wedding day. Driven by this, the four heroes begin their intensive research and start attempting to catch the enigmatic Silver Surfer. All seems to be going well, until an old friend returns from Latevria.Performances in FF were weak, and I cannot say that they have improved so much. Nevertheless, this time they somehow become more than simply awesome humans for children. Ioan Gruffudd is back as the Silver Surfer, and I am in favor of the writers' decision to bring him out like a proper nerd, which he is the comics. Jessica Alba falls into that category of actresses which have looks, but little talent, even though this kind of blandness is evident in Sue too. Chris Evans is definitely one of the most up and coming stars of Hollywood, and whilst judging him on his acting isn't that easy, he's got that charisma and charm which easily makes him an audience favorite. In the last film, Michael Chiklis, as the Thing, had a far more interesting role, as he was insecure and ashamed of how he was, and whilst it's certainly a nice change to have a superhero film without these internal conflicts, his character is ignored.In terms of action sequences, the film delivers, and whilst it certainly is becoming boring to see Sue Storm producing force fields, the Silver Surfer is extremely welcome, as he pumps up the action. From the thrilling city chase to the evasion of rockets during his capture, every moment in which he's on the screen, the film sees a colossal improvement. Dr. Doom has lost his charm and his final showdown is rather disappointing. And even though Galactus isn't as awe inspiring as in the comics, the scale is huge and it gives rise to much more exciting sequences.The special effects have improved and whilst the Silver Surfer is the main highlight, Galactus is also a feast for the eyes. However, my favorite special effects sequence has to the creation of the crater in the river Thames. The scene was climatic and you could for once feel the tension and fear of the citizens.A disappointment in the film has to be the lack of emotion. When Sue and Reed plan to abandon the group you'd expect some more drama, but everything is shallow and the film goes on without giving any importance to these scenes which could be emotional heavyweights.VerdictFantastic Four 2 has its flaws, but unless you are one of those people who start freaking out as soon as they see something that is different from the comic, then you'll find this film to be a relaxing and fun treat, coupled with a priceless 93 minute running time.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

(and the kids can see it too!),7,6 October 2007,"This, my third review on IMDb, is on a rarity: a pretty good sequel to a pretty mediocre original. The Positives: -The Silver Surfer is a great visual effects creation, and is partially what anchors this film far above the first film (being voiced by Laurence Fishburne and played by Doug Jones definitely helps). Oh, and the rest of the effects are solid as well. -The film revels in humor, and provides a solid amount of genuine laughs (I even found a good amount of Chris Evans' quips funny). -The portrayals of the characters are closer to the source material this time around, though Jessica Alba needs to make Susan Storm at least a bit more intelligent (I'm not saying she's an idiot, though). -Most of the action scenes are pretty entertaining, especially the chase between the Human Torch and the Silver Surfer. -With a PG rating and a 90 minute running time, the film is a great matinée movie. -You'll have a good time if you keep in mind that this is supposed to be as silly as it is. The Negatives: -Julian McMahon's Doctor Doom is back, and more lame and insulting to the character than ever! There really is no reason why he should be back, as the film would have been just fine without him. -The drama and romance moments are a mixed bag. While some work fine (especially those between the Thing and his girlfriend-I think her name is Alicia), others just come off as cheesy and unconvincing. -Chris Evans in still annoying at times (I know the character is supposed to be, but I think Mr. Evans is pushing it). -Product placement.

Seriously, I thought they couldn't make a worse film that the original Fantastic Four, but I have been proved wrong.From the gratuitous attempts at showing Alba as naked as possible, to the less-than-convincing physical presence of the Thing, to the miscasting of Alba and whoever plays Reed, to the pointless changes in the story, to a bland visual style (performed upon one of the most visually dynamic creations in comic book history) to the endless scenes of dull dialogue. Nothing goes right, here as in the first film. Galactus is a hungry cloud with no actual personality at all, and the obnoxious military man seems totally unaware of who and what the Fantastic Four are.

Where is The Thing busting stuff? Well, in all fairness, I often complain that action movies do not have enough story. This one does, but goes a bit overboard with all the wedding drama and the comic book science. Maybe four heroes are too many to try to do the Spider-man soap opera thing. Still, it isn't a bad movie. The effects are great, the story is okay and the Surfer has potential as a tragic villain and these things make the sequel a little better than the original, which only had the great effects and the endless action scenes.Well, the fab four are back. Rex (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan (Jessica Alba) are still trying to get married, and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) is still trying to meet chicks and celebrating the joys of being a celebrity. A threat to destroy the planet starts to interfere with the wedding plans (can anything EVER interfere with ANY all-important wedding plans?) and only the Fantastic Four can step up. There is lots of silly science and logic gaps big enough for the Earth to escape through. Stan Lee has a great cameo and the effects are worth the price of admission.Hard to call! Those who love super-hero action flicks will probably find it a suitable, but less entertaining sequel, as they squirm and wonder where the rest of the action is.

I haven't been weaned on them... I won't conceal that that I've always been drawn to the darker Marvel material such as the Punisher. In fact, ""dark and morbid"" are probably reserved for the Punisher, if we examine the origins of every major title to hit the news stands in the past 50 years.But onto the film... where Spiderman revels in its altruistic to a fault pauper protagonist who can't reap his reward for fear of violating some nonexistent superhero code, Fantastic Four is about four heroes who are in the public spotlight. It's the opposite, and whereas I criticized Spiderman for playing the hardship card way too often, Fantastic Four is manufactured cool which is exactly like Ocean's Eleven/Twelve/Thirteen, it's so boring.The plot about Silver Surfer coming to earth and whupping our foursome with his intergalactic powers... and then there are a few divergent story lines with say, Doom coming back, and Reed marrying Sue. The dialogue is truly groan-worthy... Reed is not a charismatic geek in the film, he just makes you want to bury your head in your lap. Sue hopelessly adores him and bitches when she finds out he is working on something to help out the US military, and the military's top brass engage in some of the stupidest banter I haven't seen committed to script. (At one point, a general tries to allude to Reed's non-participation in sports in high school... and acts 10 paygrades below his rank while doing so.) I didn't appreciate the obligatory disaster-happens-and-four-work-together-to-save-ppl scenes in the first movie and I don't appreciate them here... they're little more than filler, and they're not very creative in my opinion. X-Men did this with much more flair and suspense, in Fantastic Four it's another yawn-inducing crescendo that barely raises the pulse on this unplausible, unlikeable, mediocre movie. I give it 3.

The first FF movie was great, I'll tell you that much, but it was even greater that Tim Story wasted no time into getting the sequel underway right after the first one was released. The special effects were more improved. The funny stuff got more funnier. And the romance between Reed and Sue showed a bit more zing as they approached their wedding day.

Whoever did the work on this guy deserves higher praise than he thinks because the Surfer was done perfectly, just like in the Marvel Comics! BRAVO!

Although it isn't completely faithful to the series of comics that ran with both Galactus and the Silver Surfer, the writers do manage to stay true to the basic concepts of the original comic book. Having recently seen the ""special edition"" of ""Fantastic Four"" that film actually was improved by most of the restored scenes of character development. Likewise, I'm sure that would be the case here as well.

272,keitharan,Expectation Matchstick,7,8 July 2007,"Just back from the theater and thought, ""FFRSS... exactly as I could have hoped for."" The greatest film ever: of course not. Shakespearean caliber performances: of course not. So, you ask, ""how did it meet my expectations?"" For starters, my expectations were real, their backbone being the first FF. If you saw that, you could not possibly expect this second installment to offer much more. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing astounding. Just a playful, escapist, superhero action movie based semi-faithfully on its roots as a playful, escapist, superhero comic book. And cool CGI as the trailer unveiled. Armed with this as a backdrop to what FFRSS might bring to the table, I'd say it exceeded my expectations, a little. In part because the characters are familiar, and despite an absence of striking depth, they have genuine likability.This is not to say FFRSS is an outstanding movie. Nor is there a noteworthy flaw. The plot is neither three-dimensional, nor totally lacking. The script is weak, but with some funny/cutesy one-liners that seemed to come off universally well with the crowd at my theater. The acting was mediocre, but counter-balanced by the likable characters, an ounce affection for the comic book roots, and a pinch of latitude for the genre. And, considering this genre, and the expectation standard established by the first FF, it seems bizarre that so many folk have inked reviews on IMDb which parse and pick at this movie as though it was billed as an Oscar contender. And comparing it to action hero gems like Spiderman, or Pirates, etc. I mean, really, how could anyone stand in line at the box office with that sort of expectation? Yet, they do.And one guy...Sa'ar Vardi(saarvardi@walla.co.il), from Israel...had the matzoh balls to pick at every actor from every angle, even stating that ""Jessica Alba isn't even that pretty any more."" Good God and OYE VEY...what is wrong with you dude (dudess). Do I hear a cat fight, or have you switched teams? I'd wager that even when she is invisible, Alba has more sugar on the eye than you. What should you expect? Well, let's see. This movie is about 4 comic book characters, one who turns into a flying matchstick, one who becomes invisible, one who turns into plastic elastic, and one who is a rock (made of sponge). That's the expectorant you should toss in one pocket before reaching into the other. The Silver Surfer character was cool, and the special effects a little more interesting than the previous FF.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
273,rayato,"Screw the critics, this movie's awesome!",8,16 June 2007,"Probably to say F4-2 is better than the original ain't saying much but after the massive disappointments that were 'Spider-Man 3', 'Pirates 3' and 'Shrek 3', 'Silver Surfer' was a pleasant surprise and a great time at the movies.Personally, the only redeeming grace of the original were the Fantastic Four themselves, particularly Evans and Chiklis. But when you put these likable characters with a much better script and amazing special effects you get the first truly enjoyable film of the summer.Now it wasn't perfect, I hate Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom. I hated him in the first one, and I hated him even more in the second one. And despite the world coming to an end, there wasn't really any tension throughout the entire movie.But I have to say that Evans (Torch) and Chiklis (Thing) were fantastic, Alba and Groufford were better than the first, also Kerry Washington (I love her) was pretty good too in this one.As for the Silver Surfer, I thought the effects were amazing and Fishburne was the perfect choice for him. As for the controversial Galactus (a storm cloud?) I thought it wasn't bad. It looked like a Thundercloud had sex with a Kraken, but it looked good.All in all, I enjoyed myself.

274,bartireid,A Worthy Effort,8,15 June 2007,"Just returned from seeing the movie and can't find too much to complain about, ROTSS is a worthy effort and ranks only behind Superman Returns in the recent superhero boom.This movie has a little bit of everything, The action sequences and SFX are above par, there is enough cheese to keep you smiling throughout and character development is balanced enough so it doesn't degenerate into a goo-fest.What I like about the movie is that characters and the world around them are comfortable with our hero's powers and responsibilities, which helps give the movie a genuine comic book feel. Whilst the characters themselves are vulnerable enough to make them human. You get the feeling that the director (Tim Story) and writers (Frost and Payne) wanted to make a superhero movie, and were prepared to sacrifice the self-indulgence that has marred the Spiderman Trilogy and the turgid morality teachings of the X-men series.The characters aren't without their charm least of all Ioan Gruffudd who leads nicely from the front as Reed Richards, Jessica Alba illuminates the screen with her blend of beauty and strength as Sue Storm. Chiklis and Evans support admirably as The Thing and Human Torch respectively. The smartest touch was the return of Julian McMahon as the malevolent and diabolical Dr Doom who adds the much needed element of treachery to the movie. The Silver Surfer is the films finest work however, radiant with mystique, power and vulnerability. Tim Story does a great job of keeping the Silver Surfer's sense of martyrdom prevalent towards the end.In closing ROTSS is a credible effort doing enough to satisfy the comic book purists, whilst keep newcomers both entertained and informed. The world is saved and the next challenge awaits.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
275,mnkim,Promising but ultimately disappointing follow up to the first F4 movie,6,8 October 2007,"The Rise of the Silver Surfer started to live up to my expectations even allowing for the odd goofs. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, action, effects and basic storyline. That is I did until the character of Galactus was introduced. Reduced from a truly formidable Planet destroying and virtually impotent super being to a vague cloud of gas? The final ending was abysmal. The Silver Surfer is simply not capable of destroying or even hurting Galactus. Why did Marvel accept such a travesty. Potentially a real good film seduced into effecting a very poor ending.Please Marvel make things right. Reintroduce Galactus into a future F4 movie and this time make him live up to the being that all true Marvel fans know he should be.

I thought the concept was silly then and I still think it's silly. But, I was prepared to accept it in the spirit of a fun time at the movies.Maybe I didn't get enough sleep the night before, but for whatever reason,I sat in the theater totally incapable of connecting with the characters or the story. Perhaps this was because most of the characters seemed to be acting or speaking to be ""funny."" Humor of this sort can work, but here it seemed totally artificial and forced.As in most CG-intensive movies, there were scenes that were outstandingly impossible. Impossible doesn't need to mean unbelievable, but when it does -- as it does here -- the story falls apart under the burden of computer graphics trying to substitute for a story.The admission ticket plus the snax would have easily paid for the upcoming DVD, and more than paid for renting it. Your TV is where this movie belongs, preferably when it's free on a movie channel, or even later when it's on broadcast TV. You won't miss anything by waiting, and you'll probably enjoy watching it in an environment where you can pause the movie to get something to eat, answer the door, call your friends, or consume drink after drink.It's that bad.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
277,algjgg,"Better than the first, but could be a little better",7,16 June 2007,"I just got back from seeing this on the big screen, and was it worth it: yes and no. All comic book movies have everybody talking (""Is it going to kick ass?"", ""Is it going to suck?""), and FF: RotSS doesn't kick ass, but it doesn't suck either. I was expecting a pretty moderate superhero movie, because I know that the FF ain't as popular as Spiderman or Batman or Superman, but they couldn't be worse than Daredevil either. My point is this movie isn't horrible, but it's plagued with a few mistakes that came right out of Spiderman 3.First off, the GOOD: 1: visual effects are pretty awesome. They aren't better than Spiderman 3, but they are good.2: Johnny's humor is actually better than the first one (somewhat), along with Grim's as well.3: Jessica Alba being partially naked in a PG movie is just a BLAST to think of!!! Bravo Tim bravo!!! Now the BAD: 1: there are very little fight seqeunces in this movie, and pretty much all of them don't beat the first movie's fight scenes.2: Johnny's humor is pretty funny, but some of it is pretty lame and mediocre.3: Galactus. He suffers just what Venom did in Spiderman 3: TOO LITTLE SCREEN TIME!!!!! I admire the fact they changed his appearance (from a giant monolith with a crown to a cloud of dust and energy), and he's a good character to put into the movie, but they could of put a little more background into him besides ""Some call him Gah Lac Tus, the destroyer of worlds."" Ooooo scary.4: Last, but certainly not least is the Silver Surfer. He's also an outstanding character. Doug Jones did a pretty good job of portraying him, but there's just one problem: LAWRENCE FISBURNE DOES HIS VOICE-OVER!!!! Horrible. JUST. PLAIN. HORRIBLE!!!! His voice doesn't even match the Silver Surfer's look!!But overall, it's a darn good superhero movie, just ignore Morpheus's voice the entire time.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
278,JasonM225,Fantastic Four 2 better than the original,10,18 June 2007,Back in 2005 when I saw the original Fantastic Four I thought it was going to be amazing instead I sat through two hours of boring film. When I saw the trailer for Fantastic Four 2 I said to myself here we go again and it isn't worth spending the money.So I decided to see movie because I love the comic book adaptations. After I walked out from seeing FF2 I was very happy knowing sometimes a sequel can better than the original. With the return Dr. Doom and the new Character Silver Surfer gave the movie more momentum than what the original had. FF2 followed the comic story of Silver Surfer very well and faithfully.Fantastic Four 2 was actually better than Spider-man 3. That's a surprise. With so many one liners in this movie it's good to know I can walk out of movie theater with lines from movie that are not only memorable but funny as well.By the way don't leave the theater after the movie is over there's a little surprise at the end.,Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Seriously why the hell would you make an awesome villain like that a cloud. The only good part of the movie was the fight at the end with the silver surfer. This movie was bad but hopefully the reboot will make up for that. If they make a second reboot of the fantastic four and make a proper galactus then I will be very happy but if they make a second reboot and don't make a proper galactus I will go mental",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
280,iso-kincses,It's high time to stop these crap flowing!,3,19 June 2007,"Three guesses why they rarely can do a decent Marvel adaptation:1:-( The targeted audience must (?) contain everyone. Initially studios considered comic book adaptations to be well on the risky side (and it was true of course, before CGI), so they couldn't allow themselves to let a single ticket loose. They don't seem to realize that there's not much risk in putting a Marvel character up to the silver screen than in making an adaptation of a bestselling novel. Not any more. Some films don't even try to deny this old-fashioned attitude, like this Fantastic Four flick. It's a family movie, NOT a comic book adaptation! (See what they made of The Thing. Originally, as I remember him, it was a bitter and rough character who easily got into a rampaging mood and cigarette smoke surrounded his face. Now, he's a funny-burper, who never stops apologising for his lovable clumsiness. Cute? Pathetic is the word.)2:-( Stan Lee is a sentimental old gentleman, who once put the soul into the superheroes, but I guess most of the readers (except weirdos like Banky) are turning through the pages on which Peter Parker is listening to the words of wisdom of Aunt May, or the Torch is having a dilemma about enjoying himself instead of wishing the whole cosmic radiation debacle hadn't happened... Readers like to see them kicking a$$! And I hope moviegoers even more so. And since the likes of Blade, The Matrix and the whole new breed of Chinese cinema, kicking a$$ doesn't mean hurling CGI-flashes at each other! Would it be TOO violent if we saw something like The Thing lands a king-sized punch on some(one/thing)s face? In slow-mo if I could ask for more?! And of course in that case he would move like he wasn't a husky guy in a ton of latex foam, but like he was a comic book icon brought to life! Kiddies can beat/shoot the living s**t out of a (more and more realistically animated) person with their Playstation consoles, but can't see such things on screen? Hipocracy has no boundaries. 3:-( When they try their best shot and aim a bit higher, say in Batman: The Beginning, they still just reach up to the adolescent-level. There you go with a problematic, dark"", philosophic hero who still doesn't kick a$$. Well he does some, but we don't actually SEE it, thanks to the director. All we see is a cape-ballet and a pointy-eared freak hanging upside down. Tormented soul? Who the f@k cares? Like, are we in high school, moaning around the I doesn't fit in""-theme, or what? If your character is problematic, put them in a likewise problematic universe. An unrealistic one (well, unrealistic as in comic-book-universe, rings a bell?) where they can beat up the baddies without (quasi-)moral pullbacks. Like in Sin City or in Blade or 300 (I know it's a bit rich but still, it's based on a graphic novel, so basically fits in the row). Weren't them successful? I think they were all right.So, sweeping this together: - If you're an adult who doesn't happen to be a Marvel-Universe-freak, don't go to see this one. (You won't see more of Jessica Alba's bare skin than you would on the Academy Awards, so it doesn't count either...) - If you are a kid, who doesn't like to be treated as a dumba$$, don't go to see it either. If these flicks fell big in a row, while the likes of 300 kept harvesting, they would maybe reconsider some issues and you wouldn't miss anything, there's always ways to see a rated film;-) - If you are a casting director, please note that Chris Evans at least have the decency to actually look like a superhero, unlike Tobey Maguire... - If you are a costume designer, please note that (unless you have the actors with perfect bodies like Evans and Alba) a solution MUST be the Silver Surfer way: a perfect shaped stunt"" with no actual clothes on, and certainly not an average dude squeezed into a Mexican luchador outfit! (Even the facemask fits into this category.) - If you are a director, take the bother to see some Chinese action (Stephen Chow would be highly recommended!), put it together with some really dynamic music, and don't be shy when it comes to slow motion. (I know it will raise some eyebrows, but remember Charlie's Angels? A piece of action while Prodigy's 'Smack My B**ch Up' is thundering away? Now, that is badly needed these days...) - If you are Stan Lee...well, with respect sir, but keep your influence away from the world of cinema. Rethink or retire!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
281,DrGrood,"An OK start, but where's the ending?",4,28 October 2007,"There are several good reasons why this movie gets such mixed reviews and that both the positive and negative ones make sense; RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER gets started just fine, apart from an awkward recurring bit in which the four magically exchange powers, and then -- appallingly -- two-thirds of the way through the story, apparently the production staff got tired of working on it and decided ""let's just not bother filming a third act."" What people are really saying when they say they are disappointed Galactus appears as a cloud here is that they have paid their money to see a whole story and been deprived of that. The feeling you are left with after watching this film, since its main villain, Galactus, never makes it to Earth, so there is never a meeting between the principal villain of the piece and the heroes, is that the filmmakers were actually too afraid of the character themselves to actually include the big sequences the story builds up to.We SHOULD have seen giant purple boots squashing buildings -- the ominous helmet with distinctive side ornaments blocking the sun -- Reed Richards scrambling to try and make the ultimate nullifier work in time -- rebellion by the Surfer against his master, and lots of terrific special effects as a city is destroyed as Galactus ALMOST eats earth, but they just skipped the idea of letting us see what SHOULD be there. The climax of the film just ISN'T THERE. It's built up to, but when you think it's about to start, an abrupt and not-very-believable character reversal and event takes place which tidies things up like magic, and our heroes don't have to lift a finger.This is seriously cowardly, lazy film-making. We could have had one of the best superhero movies ever made here if the original story had just been filmed as it was envisioned and written by Jack Kirby in the 1960s. What we get instead is something that plays like a Sunday Matinée musical that had to be called off early and an abrupt ending fudged because the actor playing the villain forgot he had one more entrance to make and left the building to go get an early dinner.And, for the record, Stan Lee had NOTHING to do with ""creating"" the Silver Surfer, or the X-Men or Spider-man either, for that matter; he has made a lifelong career out of exploiting brilliant original work developed and done for hire by writer/artist Jack Kirby and others and been able to get away with his claims because he knows the public assumes that Marvel comics of the 1960s were WRITTEN before they were DRAWN. In fact, the complete opposite was the case where the seminal Marvel stories were concerned. Stan Lee is not now and never was a good storyteller, nor was he an avid reader of classic science fiction and mythology as Jack Kirby was. What he is is a brilliant publicist who added ""groovy"" dialogue to illustrated stories which were handed to him completely plotted and drawn by artists such as Kirby and Steve Ditko AFTER they were complete, sometimes even including summaries of dialogue to be added to the page written in the margins. The credits for those old comic book stories should have said ""Written and Drawn by Jack Kirby, Dialogue by Stan Lee."" But, with Lee having the final word on what words got printed on the page, we got deliberately misleading inflations of the truth instead. Since the artists that developed the early Marvel stories did so work-for-hire, and Lee worked for the company, it was in his power to credit whoever he wanted, including himself, however he wanted, so first he promoted himself from dialogue writer to story author, then moved right along to ""creator."" Baloney. I know who really had the creative imagination on the team and put in the time at the drawing board. (Show me one Stan Lee dialogue script ever actually written for a Marvel comic and I'll eat this review!) At least Kirby's name appears in the credits of this movie -- it should, since he envisioned the amazing story -- one of the best ever told in comics -- and all its characters.It remains a shame to this day that Lee, in the late 1960s and early 70s, took Kirby's Surfer out of his hands and transformed a character that the writer/artist had envisioned as the very personification of pure, unfettered cosmic adventurousness into yet another whiner; Kirby's Surfer had no name, no missing girlfriend to cry about -- he was a blank slate, eager to be free of his servitude and fly through the stars at top speed and explore the universe and learn about anything, everything, with great enthusiasm. He was ignorant but learned compassion from his visit to Earth, which is why he rebelled against Galactus. Not because he missed his girlfriend! The original Surfer never whined, he battled, he quested, he flew, he dreamed. The Lee influence unfortunately affects the Surfer character in this film too; he's taken captive at one point which unfortunately for no apparent reason emotionally paralyzes him and by the end of the film, as happened in the comics as well, all life ends up sucked out of the character, as he sinks apparently into what is essentially a suicidal sort of depression, so this movie ends not with a fight but with a cop-out. Ugh.This is not to say that what DOES make it to the screen in this movie is ""bad."" It's generally not. The film just needs to be sent back into production and finished appropriately.They should have made this film years ago and let Jack Kirby direct it; he would never in a million years let this truly ""fantastic"" cosmic battle have been filmed without an ending. Mr. Kirby, and your spirit of adventure, you are missed.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

I am a long term Marvel and FF fan. As a child, I bought the Galactus trilogy as they were printed. When I was 12, I decided that I wanted to direct the movie (didn't work out that way). So I have waited for this film for a long time. In my heart I wanted these movie to make these characters seem real and to make the audience feel the enormous gravity of the challenges that they faced. I also wanted their powers -- individually and collectively -- to seem commanding in scope and power. The ""screen-reality"" of these characters feel much smaller that what I had hoped for, but I enjoyed the films anyway. I am still holding out hope that FF2 will be successful enough that more films with adequate resources will be made -- and the gravity of the characters grow to meet my expectations. PS...

Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it for the pure fact that I could escape from reality for a couple of hours but it didn't quite grab me like the first X Men or the first Spiderman movies - mainly due to too much character building. That did not put me off seeing FF2: ROTSS though as I knew that it would be SO much better than the first one - and boy was I right! Not only did this move have great special effects, some excellent humour and some real ""WOW"" moments (all I will say is that the new spaceship is pretty awesome) but it also had one of the most curious and interesting characters in a comic book movie which came in the form of The Silver Surfer. Doug Jones did a great job and Larry Fishburne as the voice of The Silver Surfer is nowhere near as bad as some people make out. Along with The Silver Surfer came Galactus who is perhaps the most imposing and threatening bad guy ever created in a comic book movie.All in all this was an amazing movie and I could quite happily go back to the cinema and watch it all over again - 10 out of 10 - best movie of 2007.....until Transformers!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Next to take the plunge was Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, which i just couldn't sit through. And in quick succession was Shrek The Third and Oceans 13. Now while Oceans 13 wasn't all bad, Shrek The Third was just not great. So as i walked into the cinema today with all my friends i was hoping and praying that Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer could save the summer from all these huge let-downs. Walking out of the cinema i felt very elated, because this film is phenomenal. It wasn't too long, the story wasn't too complicated, the characters were all brilliantly played, the action was awesome, the special effects were great as well, the list just goes on. However there was one thing that made this movie so great, and that was the fact that it felt like a summer blockbuster. I was sat in the cinema thinking to myself, this exactly what it was meant to be like watching Pirates of the Caribbean and Shrek and that makes this film the bar for this summer.

Months later, I saw it on Dish Network at work when it was slow(work was slow not the movie). After the first 15 minutes, I was wishing I had seen in theaters. With ROTSS, it happened fast. My brother took me and dad the 2nd weekend it was out. What a ride. An awesome hour and a half. The biggest assets are really small notations-Reed being more of a leader, Johnny finally expressing some maturity. SPOILER ALERT!! And a real cute treat that actually happens twice. After Johnny has his first encounter with SS, he accidentally switches powers with Sue and back again. Just a couple minutes later after Reed realizes what happened, Thing, goofing off, touches Johnny, and presto, flames out and you get to see Michael Chiklis without the makeup, even better you get to see what Johnny would look like as Thing. And it happens at the end when Johnny absorbs the teams powers to fight Doom. You get a FantasticTorchThing combo which is pretty impressive on screen. The SS, himself, was amazing. On and off the board. Once his dialogue starts, you really believe in the character and enjoy watching him. And he looks perfect. MORE SPOILERS!! The only weak points are not really seeing Galactus, just more of a smoky shell ready to eat Earth. And the effects, specifically Reed. You could totally see FX editing between Ioan Gruffudd and the CGI stretching. With all the advancement in digital effects, I expected the stretching to be silky smooth and NOT saying to my brother,""You can see where the CGI starts.""

Its hard for these movie companies to stop making these movies and aiming for younger kids who can't drive to the theatre. So the parents have to take the kids and thus, a movie sells more tickets.

The first movie wasn't terrible but it wasn't very good either. The acting is sub par except for Michael Chiklis who is okay as Thing. The plots have been mishandled too. The only good thing about this movie is The Silver Surfer who is handled well and it is an interesting plot within this movie. Other than that they need to go back to the drawing board or just stop ruining this fond childhood memory of mine!

288,ZombieMcQueen,An embarrassment on many levels.,2,16 January 2010,"the original Fantastic Four was tired and clichéd, but there was a certain charm to it. Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer doesn't fall too short from the tree, but it doesn't quite live up to the fun of the first one either.the (thin) storyline follows around the sudden appearance of strange phenomenon around Earth. the Fantastic Four have settled into their lives, and have been comfortably embraced by the citizens into their normal day-to-day lives. the military soon comes calling, and right as Reed Richards and Sue Storm are about to tie the knot at the alter, the Silver Surfer shows up. Johnny Storm has an encounter with him, and it leaves The Human Torch in a bad fix: when he touches another member of the team, the powers are switched. the Four struggle to settle their differences, public and private, as they try to uncover the mystery of this new threat. meanwhile, Victor Von Doom has (rather inexplicably) returned, and sets up his own schemes for the Silver Surfer.I have to admit, I had low expectations for this movie. I went to see it only so that I could set up an opinion of it that's actually based on how I took the film. I'm sure most comic fanboys won't bother seeing the flick, but will set up their own opinions of it anyway. but I digress. the storyline is very, very, VERY poorly put together. we're talking worse than Ghost Rider here. the special effects are quite good, and they definitely raise the film for me. the visual fun and intense special effects are what makes this movie so damn fun in the first place (as was the case for me with the original). the characters are very badly done here, though. I wasn't too pleased with how they were played out in the first movie, but they're even worse here. Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards serves no real purpose outside of lame dramatic relationship material, and he doesn't even have the gray sideburns that he gained mysteriously in the first movie. I realize that's comic-book-geek-nitpicking, but hey, it's still really stupid. Jessica Alba as Sue Storm once again remains only to flash cleavage (and her naked body in one scene) and wear entirely too much makeup. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis don't serve up the playful banter as well as in the previous adventure, but their separate performances aren't too bad. Julian McMahon as Von Doom is little more than a throwaway character, but who really shines in this movie is the character of the Silver Surfer, largely thanks to voice-over work of Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus from the Matrix films). however, it turns out the Surfer isn't the real villain here, and fans of the comic will know why. this villain, though, is very poorly conceived. you never really see him for what he really looks like, and the way he is dispatched in Rise Of The Silver Surfer is completely ridiculous. it's flashy and cool-looking, but illogical.one really nice point about this movie that i'm sure most people won't think of: the score. it's simply wonderfully. it's well written, it follows with the appropriate scope of the film, and it sounds amazing, much better than the ""insert music here"" soundtrack of the first Fantastic Four. Stan Lee also makes the best cameo here out of all comic-related films (outside of Mallrats, of course).overall, it's a mediocre flick, one not to think about so much. especially you, comic book fans. if you all think about it, you'll be sorely disappointed with all the writing mistakes that have been made.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

I went into this as a childhood fan of F4 and a major post-Satriani fan of Surfy... and by midway I was thoroughly disgusted.The Silver Surfer is a character ripe for the...silver screen, but in F4 II he's little more than a nifty prop. His total number of lines here is around 12 and he does little more than make a few brief cameos before he self-destructs. So much for the original ""exile to Earth"" storyline, and obviously for Surfy's future presence in this franchise. What a colossal waste.As others have pointed out, the CGI rendering of the Surfer was unimaginative and wooden. When I think of this film's treatment, then recall in my mind's eye what the great Moebius did with such spare, understated artistry in ""Parable,"" it makes me want to make loud noises and break things. How is it that simple pen-and-ink drawings can convey more grace, fluidity of motion, and intensity of action than a state-of-the-art motion picture? Amazing.The rest of this film is an absolute mess, a combination of: tired and mind-numbingly-boring infighting among the Four; an endless stream of cheap one-liners that are astonishing in their stupidity even by one-liner standards; a couple of unintentionally-comedic left wing political potshots the juvenile writers just couldn't help themselves from throwing in; several maddening contradictions of aspects of the Four's ""powers"" as spelled out in the first film; capped off with an extended and laughably-implausible Dodge Ram ad (American automakers can't even do cars that run on the ground, let alone Jetsonian hovercars.) So with the virtual certainty that another of these is in the works as I write this, I'm wondering where, exactly, this inept Story/Payne/Frost crew will go with the next F4. Two new hours of ""Johnny, you must stop being so irresponsible and 'narcissistic!'"" and ""Reed, all you care about are your geeky gadgets!"" and ""OK, that hurt?""The trouble with superhero flicks is that the best story is the one where the characters first discover their powers, and that was done - somewhat better - in the first film. To continue beyond that requires intelligence and integrity among the writers and directors. So far Batman (excepting the dismal ""Batman Returns"" and the truly horrid ""Batman and Robin,"") is alone among superhero film franchises in sustaining itself with good writing and direction. F4 is apparently doomed to remain a schlocky grab-bag of blatant in-film product advertising and slick but wasted visual effects, tacked onto writing, direction and acting with all the depth and subtlety of a high school play.Stan Lee, both in endorsing and appearing in this mess, has apparently lost the ability to take himself seriously. Maybe he, Story, Payne and Frost could be ejected for a team of Frank Miller, Moebius, and perhaps Spiderman co-creator Steve Ditko, to turn Fantastic Four into something that looks like it was produced by responsible adults. Maybe I'm dreaming.Surfy deserves a separate franchise of his own, but it would have to be full-blown Sci-fi along the lines of Lucas and Whedon, and of course it would require writers at above Junior High School level.The only thing that kept me sitting through the mess that is ""Rise (and Abrupt Fall) of the Silver Surfer"" to the bitter end, was a combination of hope that the story would suddenly get better and the need to finish the humongous $6 tub of popcorn I sprung for.'Guess I need to get a better breakfast strategy...",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

291,dibyajyotisarma,Fun-tastic???,6,7 July 2007,"God save us! Another sequel this week! This summer has quite turned out to be the summer of sequels. Hope this one is the last! Move aside, Super-man, here comes the Fantastic Four. Who wants to see one single superhero fighting his inner demon, or whatever? Here's four of them, each with their unique powers and a supervillain, who is equally fantastic, and there's also Fantastic Four's perennial nemesis Dr Victor Von Doom. But first, the Fantastic Four. For the uninitiated, the story began in the 2005 original film, which was based on Stan Lee's comic book heroes, where a scientist Reed Richard, along with his two friends and ex-girlfriend, and Dr Doom, goes to space looking for some clouds of cosmic energy. The cloud soon engulfs them, turning into superbeings. How they return to earth and try to negotiate with their newfound powers formed the crux of the first film, which really did not set the box office ringing. That did not deter director Tim Story and the producers to come up with the sequel. The highlight this time is the Silver Surfer, who himself is quite heroic in the comic book world, having starring roles in quite a few Marvel publications. Without going deep into his genealogy, he is an alien and a servant of the fearsome cosmic entity known as Galactus. Now, this G-guy eats planets, and our surfer (complete with a surfboard that can fly anywhere) provides them to his master. Predictably, the next delicacy happens to be our dear earth, and Fantastic Four must get their act together to save the world. But there are problems galore in the quadrangle's life as well. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his girlfriend Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) want to get married. But it's not easy for superheroes to get married without getting public attention. The other two Johnny Strom (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) has two their share of women-related problems. But the major problem occurs when the surfer appears and Johnny Strom aka Human Torch has an encounter with the surfer and all his powers seemed to be disintegrated. Now, how does the foursome save the world without having their powers in place? Will they join hands with their nemesis Dr Doom? The highlight is certainly the silver surfer, with a metallic body and the voice of Laurence Fishbourne. How he moves and swishes is awesome, despite the fact that it's all CGI. And for a change, instead of fighting over city skylines (they do that too), they go to the space for the showdown. And unlike Spider-Man, the film retains its comic book flavour. It does not go all hyper about realism, and in their own why their the superheroes impress, not to mention a beautiful Alba! And, thank god, they have got a good sense of humour, if not a strong plot line, despite the director being called 'Story!' You are disappointed with Super-Man because you expected much more from him. Don't expect much and you wouldn't be disappointed.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
292,Zofh,Kicks A**!,10,18 June 2007,"This film could have been a mess like Spiderman 3 but Tim Story deftly navigates the multiple stories quickly and efficiently from scene to scene. It was in danger of becoming fairly complicated if adhered to strictly ala the Comic Books. What Story did was balance out the film time, budgetary pressures, target audience attention, Studio hidden pressures, etc etc and at times perhaps TOO quickly rocket from scene to scene; but you know what - this movie works. It does exactly what it says on the tin. It's a movie about fictional Superheroes - not real life heroes like Gandhi, Mandela, etc which would require detailed analysis and depth. This movie gives us what we expect and demand. Namely, a Summer blockbuster which zips past joyously quickly at just over 90 minutes - without so much as pausing for breath! Perfect.

294,Sir_Ipkiss,Not Quite Fantastic,5,22 June 2007,"i eagerly looked forward to watching the new fantastic 4 (the rise of the silver surfer). maybe that's why i was so sorely disappointed with the end result. the story picks up from where the last one left off, with the imminent wedding of Reed and Sue, Johnny taking to the attention like a duck to water, and ben now coming to terms and even enjoying his role as the big rock. when weird craters and environmental anomalies start cropping up around the world, with the silver surfer's arrival to earth, reed is sucked into the military's investigation, while juggling his upcoming wedding. the movie starts off at a nice pace without really heading anywhere up to the wedding. there's a nice feel to the movie with light heartedness and beautiful special effects. the wedding is interrupted by the silver surfer and a really climactic first meeting between him and johnny. doc doom returns in ultimately boring fashion and his first meeting with the silver surfer results in him teaming up with the fantastic 4. the rest of the story pendulates between the attack on silver surfer, then doc doom and then galactus. this is where the movie lost me. it wasn't balanced. it took so long to get to the battle with the silver surfer and it didn't climax with a rather tame capturing of the silver surfer. the feelgood moment of the movie follows with sue learning of the surfer's origins and immeditely followed by the expected betrayal by doc doom. then doc doom is the bad guy. this leads straight into the battle scene and the story just gets lost in ANOTHER really boring battle scene. doc doom is beaten rather easily after johnny absorbs everyone's powers. then galactus arrives. in about a minute he's defeated. a power that EATS PLANETS beaten in a minute by a silver surfer reunited with his board. the movie overall just didn't do it for me. the humour was corny which worked most of the time but just got really lame after half an hour. the battles were really really really boring. it didn't make the audience feel the constantly shifting balance of power and i don't think i ever felt that the good guys would lose. it's a tried and tested method and everyone does it - because it works. the special effects were brilliant. but that's a given in today's world of movies. and it shouldn't be highlighted as a thing to see the movie for. the acting was OK. nothing bad about it and it kept within the storyline. they delivered the punchlines when and where needed but the relationship between ben and johnny wasn't punched enough. and jessica alba just looked a bit too made up. in today's movies where so many movies are blamed for being too long, this one was noticeably too short. final comment - it did enough - but barely that - to just keep its head above water - but i cringe in thinking all it could have been.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
295,RomeoQQ,The worst money I've spend this year,1,25 June 2007,"It might just be me that isn't really into all the cartoon stuff, I never watched much when I was young, quite frankly, I watched close to nothing (some of us played outside you know ;p). What I mean is that I don't have that hidden urge to love, every single cartoon ripoff movie thats released, which is the tendency I've seen from a lot of people that used to get square eyes in front of the TV.Anyways, I really didn't find this movie interesting at all, as with the first one, the whole thing was quite uninspiring, from lazy writing, to horrible acting, and most of all a ridiculous plot that felt rushed through like hardcore diarrhea.Frankly, I don't understand what a actor like Michael Chiklis, wants from a movie like this, he is way to good to be wasting his time on this garbage.The whole thing is just stupid, take for example the silver surfer, a guy thats been preparing worlds for devouring in the masses, after a few minutes of conversation with a (to him) alien female, he turns into a self sacrificing hero, protecting a foreign world he knows nothing about, not to mention, if he could kill galactus (galaxtus?) even though losing his own life in the process, why didn't he do it from the start if it would have saved the one he loved, plus own home world (?!!?!?!?).Worst money I've spend this year.

296,henriklundberg88,Excellent Sequel,9,1 July 2007,"When going to the cinema I was rather dubious about this title especially after I heard what they had done to Galactus, so I was not expecting to be amazed. However as soon as the started sequence kicked in I was interesting for it was some very impressive special effects, so I carried on watching and it just kept getting better and better. Had more action then the first but also interesting character development (even though was the typical development in most super hero shows) but what was great addition in this film was the dialogue, the comic lines where very amusing and very funny, also the whole celebrity angle was actually quite realistic because that what would happen if some people saved lives and had super powers.The Silver Surfer looked excellent, even though his characters wasn't as developed as he should of been it was enough to make his character have depth.Galactus, was amazing I loved the whole giant robot/ being in the old cartoons sitting on a throne. The way he was presented was a lot more impressive and quite simple awesome (some of the special effects when it gets close to earth where jaw dropping), the only issue was he was not shown enough as a thinking entity or living being, he was kinda show as a giant monster, there was not enough reason or back story given to it, it was not shown as a complicated entity like it was in the comics and cartoons. But it exceeded my expectations in presentation and appearance.Summary: Some of the best special effects have ever seen, excellent action good comedy and interesting characters.Overall a damn good hero movie even though they had made quite a few changes.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
297,lee-wilson,"Okay after a slow start, some good sequences but not amazing",5,14 June 2007,"I was lucky enough to get tickets to the world premiere in London, it was very cool to walk down the red carpet (which was actually blue) surrounded by the stars and hundreds of screaming people.Some background, the first film I had heard such bad reviews of that I never saw it until last year when I caught it on TV in the US and I liked it much more than I thought I would. The Silver Surfer starts very shabbily I thought, about twenty minutes of lame humour around the wedding of Reed Richards and Sue Storm and the interpersonal relationships between the four. If I had paid to see it I would have been kicking myself at this point. However once the story kicks in properly and the action sequences start the next 70 minutes are very enjoyable indeed.The story concerns the Surfer coming to the Earth and the four quickly realising that his presence means that the planet is doomed since any planet he inhabits is destroyed a few days later. They must find a way of communicating with the Silver Surfer to find out why he does what he does and then battle an old enemy in order to save the world. The last hour contains some fantastic sequences that it would be a shame to spoil but by then there is finally a great balance of humour and excitement. I must say they have a kick ass new mode of transport and I particularly loved seeing the sequences in my city of London.There are some rather poor by modern standards CGI early on especially the Mr Fantastic stretching which looks cheaply done but later effects are much much better with the Silver Surfer himself looking fantastic. I wouldn't say rush out and see it but not bad at all.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Beside these great moments with the surfer flying about the only real disappointing moment was when Galactus appears as only cloud. The size of which is huge and I found impressive and can only guess that it hides his ship. What I really wanted though was to see him or at the minimum was to hear his voice, and everyone I think will agree, No the surfer can not destroy Galactus as the surfer has only a portion of Galactus' power so I would say he has been transported away. Never mind though as it is still a great film even with these tiny things that annoy a true marvel fan.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Good special effects, easy-to-follow plot line, lots of humor and light drama. A suggestion for IMDb.com; You should include in your ""Memorable Quotes"" section the dialog between Reed & Gen. Hager in which Reed stood up for himself. During the picture, Gen. Hager had been belittling and insulting Reed and Reed just stood there and took it. Then, in the forest scene, where the F.F. and the Army were setting up a trap for the Silver Surfer, Gen. Hager said that the Army would take over and that Reed & his ""freaks"" should stay out the way. This was HIS team, and HE was the quarterback. Then he told Reed that he never played sports in school, did he? I only saw this once, so I might not get it exactly: Reed replied: ""You're right. I never played sports in school. I stayed home & studied like a good little nerd. And now 15 years later, where am I? I'm the greatest genius of our time, I'm going to marry the hottest girl in the world, and the high school JOCK is asking for MY help, and I'm not going to do a THING for you until you show me & my friends some RESPECT!"" At which point, the General gives a half-smile, turns to his men and says,""Give the man whatever he wants."" As I said, I only saw this film once, but this was the most memorable quote for me.

Wait, what fight scenes? There was virtually no fighting int his movie at all. But does a Marvel movie need that? Yes. But somehow this one pulls it off. better than the first that's for sure.

302,msb_rock,Did I misread the word Fantastic?,1,6 July 2007,"Well I walked into the cinema with an open mind, the first Fantastic Four was not the greatest Superhero film of all time but it was OK. But after watching the opening half hour of the film I was getting restless and bored, the story lacked action that we come to expect from films of this nature. In the overall scheme of things I would say there is about 20 minutes of action at the most in this film, instead it centers around the characters of Mr Fantastic and The Invisible Woman and will they ever get married, quite frankly I was sick and tired of hearing about their wedding.The other problem with this is that the characters are not as developed and rounded as those such as Batman, Spider man and the X-Men. All the four characters are 1 dimensional, Mr Fantastic is just the science man who explains whats happening in the film every 5 minutes, the Invisible Woman is just the eye candy in the film who just changes her clothes in every scene, the Flaming Torch is just an arrogant guy who turns into flames and the Thing is just a rock from Brooklyn. These superheroes lack the back story, lack the personal problems apart from not being able to get married...YAWN! Big deal. In Batman and Spider man the main characters have problems, have their own little wars waging on inside them constantly but with the Fantastic Four everything seems to nice.If there is one good point it would have to be the Silver Surfer, who doesn't really do that much to be honest. He looks cool and he steals the film from the supposed main characters. It would have been better just to make a Silver Surfer movie instead without the Lame 4. Another good part is Stan Lee's cameo.But overall the Fantastic 4 fails to deliver and I just hope that a third film is not on the cards. Give up with the Fantastic 4 and bring on Batman who at one point the fantastic four make fun of. What a joke! Did I hear someone say Fantastic? No, of course not.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

If you're over 13 years of age, this movie is NOT for you.The surfer is hot with fabulous abs and a perfect chest and if you still need more man meat then you get a shot of fire-boy without his shirt, too.

I will admit, it was quite entertaining with all the special effects, but it still lacks acting abilities. Neither characters were convincing in their roles, especially Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman.I also have to say the movie felt too cartoonish where I understand they're trying to target children and family (that's where the PG comes in), but at least, it could have picked up a little more.I seriously wouldn't recommend anyone to see it at the theaters, that is unless you have kids, but wait for DVD, or even better, wait for cable.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
305,70shoe,Better this time,8,16 June 2007,"Possible Spoilers Ahead I'm not reviewing this as if it were Citizen Kane or the Godfather, so fanboys take notice: This is a fun summer movie. It is better than the first(which I enjoyed as well).The team did not squabble as much and audiences were given a classic Marvel situation of heroes versus hero with the appearance of Silver Surfer. Doom was used just enough to give the team someone to battle.True, Galactus was not actually seen in his comic form, but truthfully, that would have been overkill- which is what made Spider-Man 3 such a drag. Rise of the Silver Surfer was just enough that it was still enjoyable to watch.Thankfully, there were also fewer ""hip tunes"" interlaced in this one, and a better focus on the theatrical score. The movie was well paced, with fewer dragging moments.FF's cast is pretty low-key in the media (with the possible exception of Jessica Alba, but even she is not as over-hyped as Kirsten Dunst).Folks, this is the kind of stuff, the little things, that make summer movies fun and not just ""events"". Is this mindless entertainment? To a degree, yes, but much worse has been done in the past (and I'm sure will be done in the future).To me the real appeal here, the true key, is that we don't have to suffer through secret identities with the FF. Their characters are established as celebrities, so we can fore go the usual crap and get down to battles! Here's the wrap up with just a wee bit of rant: It's enjoyable. See it. I sincerely hope we get a third installment (but that's enough) possibly with Mole Man as the heavy.This picture is going to be overshadowed by Spider-Man 3, but unjustly so. In my opinion, FF is a much better summer flick and I'll give you two reasons why: 1. FF was not hyped and rammed down the public's throat like Spidey.2. FF was not the victim of over-marketing like Spidey. I have become convinced that the more marketing tie-ins a picture has attached to it the bigger the disappointment it will truly be. You literally cannot turn around in a supermarket or department store without being smacked in the face with Spidey, Shrek, or Pirates merchandise and to me this over-saturation is what heralds the true quality of a movie. All of these pictures hit big opening weekend and then sunk like a stone. More merchandising says to me that an effort is being made to make money a movie that will fall fast because it's quality is poor. Hulk, Phantom Menace, The Grinch, the list goes on and on.

The Mr. Plastic/rubber guy, him I really felt sorry for because you could really see he didn't enjoy the roll at all, he was not into this film.Special effects were OK, except for the surfer which was nice but honestly the T-2 movie effects were on par and that movie was made over a decade ago.Oh yeah, the voice of the surfer...take the blue pill!

A cloud with f'in arms.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer IS better than the than the little, one action scene first movie.

I think this movie could have been longer if they took the time to add DEPTH. There was no depth to the story. Things happened and were explained in a SNAP. There was no suspense or anything to make you worry the story would not have a sad ending. I would like to see a couple of action scenes where all of them tear up the town and fail. Try another scene, fight and fail. Learn their lessons and succeed. FF2 did not have this. I don't like that. But thats my opinion not fact. The other wrongs were bad jokes, and wasted time doing nothing, and i know they tried to pull in some kind of mushy sadness...but it wasn't there.

The movie was way too short, it could have been easily another 20-30 minutes longer. But it's definitely an entertaining popcorn movie. Just don't expect to much. If you go in thinking that there won't be nothing new and want to be entertained, you won't be disappointed.

First one was...all right but it was slow paced and every character needed to get developed. Some say it was down right horrible but I don't think so. The second installment once again lacked in the story/plot department. It was definitely very comic book like but even comic book motive can be identifiable outside the movie realm. The dialog was par but had some cheesy moments as well. I think the F4 can never really be compared to X-Men or Spider Man. With no disrespect the F4 are no match for them at all. It's like they are their own genre/film and they are going to have a pattern with each film. Back to the movie, dialog, all right, special effects amazing. Character development was much better, the viewer gets to see some change within each character. I am a tad disappointed that Galactus was just an enormous cloud planet eating spectrum. Oh well, it was an effort. Over all this movie is just flat out fun and entertaining. Don't have high expectations like Spider Man 3, then you will just think the movie sucks in general. Although I have to say this film surpasses spider man 3...shockingly enough. If you go to this movie, have no expectations and just sit back and enjoy the flick.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

There must have been something redeeming about it, but I can't recall what it was as I write this. Needless to say, I did not like this film. The acting, script and directing were all bad. At times I felt as though I were watching a made-for-TV movie with half-decent special effects. Admittedly, I was never a fan of the F4 comics so I don't know a lot of the background story behind the characters, but why didn't the Silver Surfer do what he did at the end of the movie a long time ago? Also, I almost always have a problem with short run times. 92 minutes was short enough, but then it took almost 30 minutes for the story to get going. The stretching scene in the dance club was absolutely ridiculous, say nothing about how bad the CGI effects looked in that scene (or any other stretching scene for that matter). Long story short, this movie was not as good as the 1st F4 (not that that was great either). Where do I go for a refund?",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

316,myword2k3,Sequel Squanders,2,13 June 2007,"Reviewed by Sarhan ""Tsar"" RashidThere are few marketing departments in the world which can convincingly fool their target demographic. Fortunately for 20th Century Fox, they have one of best.Which would explain the positive buzz surrounding ""Fantastic Four: The Rise of The Silver Surfer"". So far the ads have sold the movie as a triumph over its predecessor. It must help to have Rupert Murdoch's numerous media outlets brainwashing the public with talk of a better script and a bigger budget. None of which appears to be true.They've also again managed to stir some controversy to raise curiosity amongst the core fan base (i.e. comic book aficionados).The first movie succeeded not because of the carefully orchestrated media blitz but because at its heart it was a simple, old-fashioned comic book romp. It had a decent cast, a focused storyline and origin stories are mostly always fun.The sequel gets it all wrong by padding scene-after-scene of repetitious exposition, poorly conceived drama and bland set pieces which only end up testing the viewers' patience. It's amazing how lengthy and pointless its short 92 minute running time feels. The proceedings never manage to engage the viewers. Even the Silver Surfer, under the direction of the visually lacking Tim Story, is realised as a flat one-dimensional hero.The cast must've been chasing a quick paycheck because they all look bored exchanging quips and cheesy lines littered with unreal sci-fi more fitting for an episode of ""Star Trek"". The comic interplay between these characters in the comic books has helped set them apart from their angst ridden counterparts. Here they decide to ham it up and play it broad.A special mention though must go out to one cast member. Jessica Alba. Her sugar coated smile, sun-kissed skin tone and perfect figure would be enough to keep my heterosexual eyes glued to the screen but she failed at even managing that. It was a good call to keep her in the background for much of the first films duration but here, where she's front-and-centre, it exposes how wooden her ""acting"" truly is. Was it so difficult to find a hot Caucasian actress with blue eyes and at least moderate acting chops to play the quintessential American sweetheart Sue Storm? Dolling Alba up in a blonde wig and obvious contacts has to be one of the worst ideas in casting history. And is it just me or does she share a better chemistry with Chris Evans (Johnny Storm, her movie brother!) than with Ioan Grufford (Dr. Reed Richards, her movie fiancé!)?Sorry to be so hard on Alba. Like I said can't blame her for chasing a quick paycheck.I doubt fans of the genre will be as gullible to trust the next such product Fox unleashes upon them. For that matter moviegoers in general might just start staying away from any comic book property Fox decides to butcher.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
317,spoonerstreet,Are you kidding me?,4,1 July 2007,"This movie might have been the worst written script I have ever seen. The story was OK, but the amount of disbelief that the viewer is supposed to have for this movie was way too high, even for a comic book movie. I was disgusted at how the General asks for help from the Fantastic 4, gets it (for free) and then proceeds to lock them up. To add insult to it, he then trusts a noted super criminal while discrediting F4, and making Earth shattering decisions on the fly while his ego gets in the way.The special effects were great, and I love Michael Chiklis. Why, oh why, don't people in Hollywood ask these kind of questions before putting out a movie? Why does the Silver Surfer need The Torch's help to get through the impending doom? He can travel between planets with the greatest of ease. Why, after receiving help multiple times from the F4 is the ""government"" so quick to dismiss their help and knowledge? Why does the F4 need sponsors? So many unanswered questions that will just be dismissed as ""movie magic"". Glad I only paid matinée prices for this one.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
318,billyboy_88,Why waste money on this?,2,29 September 2007,"Why waste money and time on this crap? When I was going to see this I had so low expectations I thought they could not get any lower. Apparently they could.The only reason why I saw the movie was because one of my favorite music composers had worked on the movie. John Ottman, he has work on many major comic book movies. Superman, X-men2 and Fantastic 4. So I thought that maybe the music would get me thru the movie. Sadly it did not.The movie has all the attributes of a bad sequel, a lot of bad jokes, a lot of reference to the first movie. And the thing I hate the most, all of the over exaggerated personality traits. Johnny Storm in particular. He Is Rash and vain without limit. Its always this way with a really bad sequel, in the end of the earlier movie the flamboyant character shows that he isn’t as shallow as he seams. Then in the sequel that quality is gone with the wind. And then all character traits shines thru more than ever. Bigger is always better, or is it? I mean this might have worked fine in a comic book. But this supposed to be a movie. The only thing that I liked in this movie was the “Silver surfer”. Although I recognized Laurence Fishburnes voice right away, and at first I did not think it suited the character at all. But after awhile it grew on me. So thumbs up for the surfer.I feel like the people that made this movie thought that: “Oh well they have done Spiderman 3, X-men 3 and Superman… well what superheroes do we have left? Right, the Fantastic four. We don’t know what it will be about but we will spend a whole lot of money making it. We will just copy all of the other superhero movies, that way it will be a sure success. It will be great! Common boys let call up some sponsors” /BR",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
319,Malcius,Not so fantastic,5,13 June 2007,"Just saw this in a rather bizarre ""regional Premiere"". The film had its good moments, particularly Stan Lee's cameo and some of the other lighter moments which continued to establish the camaraderie of the Four, whilst some of the stunts and special effects were sufficiently spectacular. The early build-up in the film was reasonably well-paced as the enigmatic surfer wreaked havoc over much of the globe, but the climax failed to build up adequate tension and ends with something of an unexplained deus ex machina. Finally you end up being left with a feeling of ""so what?"" There is some light entertainment in this film but little emotional involvement, as the short run-time (less than ninety minutes) scarcely allows for more than by-the-numbers plotting.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
320,christian-356,Oddities,6,11 September 2007,"A nice blend of action, effects, and a bit of flirting as in the first movie, and the rest of the Marvel movies. However, there are a couple of oddities in the story which made even me think: How unrealistic is that! - And I'm a pretty mindless guy. I guess some ideas travel better through time than others...Weak point 1: Here we are, in the middle of our top lock-down facility, we're the army, we've brought in the alien. Let's place it in a room without camera surveillance. That makes sense.Weak point 2: During the movie we can assess the powers of the Silver Surfer. At the end of the movie, we have a pretty good idea of what he is capable of. So how can the Silver Surfer destroy a planet-eater, come on! The Silver Surfer is not powerful enough for that. Flying up the crack of Galactus wont get you anywhere, little guy. That ending simply doesn't work.Weak point 3: The combining of the four powers against Victor made great visual effects, but kind of ruined the idea of the Fantastic Four. This is more like Superman.Weak point 4: In the end, it's not the Fantastic Four who deals with the bad guy, it's somebody else - they only do it indirectly. But worse, it's all a StarTrek-like riddle with a self-contained cliché psychological solution.Weak point 5: What does Galactus actually look like? Weak point 6: Richards invents a flying machine. Wow.Weak point 7: Surfing is a universal pastime.Weak point 8: Victor doesn't really get to show off with the surfboard. I'm telling you, that guy is not evil, he's just misunderstood.Weak point 9: How can the Fantastic Four combine their powers at the end? We have only seen them swap powers until that point.Weak point 10: So Galactus needs thermo and biological energy. What's wrong with the sun's energy? Why destroy earth? Why not just harvest it?",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
321,megamart91,This is not how it should be done.,4,17 July 2007,"I was never really a big fan of the Fantastic Four, and I never really became a fan after the first movie was released in 2005. However, I was thrilled to know that in the next movie, the Silver Surfer had a bid role in the movie. Enough reason to see the film. Or so I thought...For those who do not know the Silver Surfer: It's a great Marvel Character . A lot of mysteriousness and power. And he has the mission of saving his people and his lover. The silver surfer has been around for ages (1966) and now he finally made his way to the big screen.The movie itself is OK. Not spectacular and not nearly as good as other superhero movies (Batman, spider-man, superman) but I enjoyed it, and I had a few laughs. Which brings me to my next point: This is not a comedy. It a superhero movie and therefor is should be brought in an epic atmosphere. Sure, a few jokes can't hurt anyone. But as I said: this is not a comedy.the thing in this movie that probably frustrates me most, is that the Silver Surfer is by far the most disappointing (and a bit boring) character in the history of superhero movies. The comics with the fantastic four were not that great, but I hope there will be a movie of the Silver Surfer solo. Then there is the time and the attention the silver surfer deserves.Finally I'd like to say: A great special effects team and a big budget does not guarantee a successful movie.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
322,gbsparta48,Complete mutilation of a cherished story (***Spoilers Herein***),4,16 June 2007,"Wow. Where to begin. Let's start with the positives: The Surfer looked excellent. He really did. I was impressed and excited when he first appeared.Now, the negatives: Apparently Tim Story decided Stan Lee's work, which has lasted for years because it was a great story that stood the test of time, wasn't good enough for his motion picture. Apparently the Hollywood big wigs sat in a big executive board room around a large table and decided that they could come up with a better storyline along with changing the powers/abilities of various characters and basically murdering a storyline that was near perfect.***SPOILERS*** Let's get a few things straight, people. I'm not one to hate on a movie because of a few nitpicky things. There were MAJOR plot flaws in this movie that were completely different from the original adaption. To begin with, and I want to be sure everyone understands this, The Silver Surfer DOES NOT get his powers from his board. There is no other way to say this other than ""um, no, that's incorrect."" About halfway through the flick Dr. Doom ""discovers"" that the Surfer gets his powers from his board, and you can obviously infer that at some point he is going to try and take it for himself.In the comics, the Surfer is able to fly and use his powers all on his own; he only uses the board so that he doesn't expend the extra energy that flight requires (and very rapid flight at that - faster than the speed of light).It's kind of like doing a Superman movie and saying that he gets his powers from his cape - Everyone would stare with a confused face and say, ""Wha?"" Once ""de-boarded"" The Surfer takes on an almost human-like existence (e.g. breathing heavily, fatigued, etc). Again, this is - what's the word? Oh yes - RIDICULOUS. I'm not trying to sound like some fan-boy, but it's just simply incorrect. Doing a Batman movie and making him a chimpanzee would irritate many who read the comics. The Surfer does not breath, eat, drink, etc. If you want an in-depth look at his abilities, use a search engine on the web and use a nice wik* site to explore.Aside from these obvious blunders, at the end the Surfer apparently ""kills"" or at least ""deters"" Galactus from doing his work. This is kind of like saying that an ant got the best of Rambo in field combat. I can't stress this enough - it was storyline murder.What made the Surfer stories so great is that they weren't just wham, bam thank you ma'am comics. They were very philosophical and contained a heavy amount of dialogue. In today's silver screen, most of the actors complain that they can't ""act"" enough in superhero movies. The unfortunate thing is, the creators of this movie had a great chance to appease both the fans and the actors by just simply FOLLOWING THE ORIGINAL STORYLINE.I'm not going to bore you any further complaining about this catasrophe. If you are still reading to this point, you obviously get what I'm trying to explain here. I'll sum it up like this: This movie, although visually appealing (while the Surfer is fully powered), is a complete nightmare.If you want to read a very entertaining, thoughtful, and insightful story about a man who gave up his life in order to save others and his incredible journeys after this event, go to an online search engine and type up the word ""parable"" after the words ""silver surfer."" And a few last mathematics for you, according to the comics: 1. Galactus created the Surfer 2. The Surfer, in the comics, was far too powerful for the Fantastic Four (The Surfer alone is capable of destroying planets and stars, and has done so before), board or no board. The only reason he decided to help the Four was because he was touched by humanity and the goodness of the people on Earth (specifically the Fantastic Four). 3. In the Comics, when the Surfer tried to stop Galactus, he attacked him with enough force to destroy the solar system, and Galactus didn't even budge.Now, hopefully you go and read the Parable story, so I won't ruin what happens for you. But using those guidelines, as for the movie...How in the heck is the Surfer supposed to, if you are using the least possible scenario, DETER GALACTUS?!?!?! Give me a break. I know Stan Lee was a part of this movie, but it's widely known that the Surfer is perhaps his most favorite creation, along with most comic book fans loving this specific character. So why would he go and let Tim Story literally murder this character on the big screen? Well I have the answer, folks.When you start getting old and senile, and someone hands you a big wad of cash, you pretty much stop caring about what's going on and what someone is doing with your most famous storyline.Congratulations, Avi Arad and Tim Story. Thank you for nothing.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
323,sean69ro,"Hollywood's essence perfectly captured: beautiful, but rather forgettable",6,1 July 2007,"I liked the first part of F4: it was slow, it lacked all the big bangs, but the slow introduction gave us time to get familiarized with the characters and eventually care about and relate to them. Only two other superhero movies managed that before: Spiderman (in the first two parts) and Hellboy. The sequel of the F4 adventures followed the same patterns as Spiderman 3. The story was stripped by emotions and any kind of character development, our heroes behave nothing like their comic book characters and honestly, we couldn't care less about what is going to happen with them. How was the Silver Surfer ""born"". How is he connected to his board? Nothing is answered, although from the few facts about him we can deduce the tragic nature of this hero: he is not evil, but forced in a close bond, a sacrifice he must make. And, in this case, Lawrence Fishburne's calm, deep, sad voice helped a lot, too. Galactus was a complete disappointment. Not frightening at all, his role in the story pointless in the way it is presented. If he appears in the third installment, it will be rather difficult to explain that. As I mentioned before, I liked the first movie. This one though is just another of those movies of when I'm asked about, there is only one thing I can say: nice CGI, let's not talk about the rest.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Starting with the positive, the VFX were of average standard, and imaginatively realised in places. The score created the brief moments of atmosphere there were. But there is no rescuing this horribly over-sentimental and (surely?) badly adapted film. I had always thought Ioan Gruffudd a reasonable actor from his several appearances in British drama, but I stand corrected by his god-awful performance here. However, standing as it does next to the feeble acting abilities of the other leads, it sets a standards you wish the others would aspire to.Alas, they don't. They are not helped, of course, by the revoltingly clichéd screenplay, with its ham-fisted wise-cracking 'humour' (provided mostly, and relentlessly, by the daft rock-based thing), and the constant preaching of all-American family values. Then there is the absence of any coherent story, riddled as it is with numerous plot-holes, inconsistencies, and characters being SO stereotyped (Army general, anyone?)that one can only laugh at the seriousness with which they woodenly phone in their hackneyed and predictable dialogue. It really is painful to watch in places.And deeply, though unintentionally funny in others. The ridiculously named villain, 'Victor Von Doom' hands in a performance that is as threatening and intimidating as a tossed salad, and every line he perfunctorily regurgitates raises a smile for all the wrong reasons. I might venture that he 'just looks a tit'.This is a horrible film in almost every way. I could tell you the plot, but it's rubbish, so I won't waste your time. I haven't read the comic, and almost certainly won't if this was anything approaching an accurate testament to it. I sincerely hope it wasn't, and that comic fans feel equally let down.The VFX team and the composer should leave the room and head for the pub, feeling, I'd hope, that they have contributed the only redeeming features of this unrewarding film, but everyone else involved should hang their heads in shame, and aim to do better next time.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

The silver surfer should have brought epic destruction onto humanity instead he helped the fagtastic four bring down whats his face. We didn't even get to see galactus really. Jessica Alba wasn't even that hot in this. She had this really blonde hair and really blue colored contacts or something and she just didn't look that good. The director tried to bring acting into this too. And that just doesn't work with this kind of movie. This movie is like every other marvel comic book movie.

To fully go into what I did not like about this film would take more space and time then it ultimately deserves, but I will cover the films more grievous gaffs.To start let me please comment on the acting. Never have I longed for the days of Plan 9's performances more then when I heard Ioan Gruffudd force out the most ridiculous scientific babble that only proves Gruffudd's complete lack of scientific prowess. While Gruggudd stands out above the rest, the others just fail to achieve what would be called passable acting.Bad performance aside, the true atrocity is the story. When I first saw the trailer with the Human Torch chasing down the Silver Suffer, I was filled with hope for a mindless, fun, high passed summer movie; unfortunately they only delivered on the mindless. The very seen they show in the trailer ultimately proves to be the most exciting seen in the whole movie.The majority of the plot deals with the relationship betwixt Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. The problem is two thirds of this summer action film is filled with trite dialog that no one could make look believable, respectable or believable (a problem maid even worse by bad actors delivering them). Some of the embellishment on A LOT of the dialog is almost so laughably bad, it makes one wonder if the director was trying to see just how poor he could make the film and have it still hit theaters.A lot of my other complaints contain spoilers, and even though this is a warning not to see the film, it is one opinion among many and you still may decide to see it. This may not be the deciding factor on if you spend your money on this film, but let me assure you it is not worse the price of a ticket.

Not because it's Godfather II, but because --- as when I'm reading a good comic book --- I was on the edge of my seat. The movie was well-written and interesting (even if the dialog sometimes sputtered). The story line was good and the characters had some depth. It reaches toward complexity: It's a story of love, free will, science (and science fiction), good and evil, and even a doomsday scenario. Good work. It's clear to me that the writers and directors understand what comic books are all about: tightly written spectacles that keep you on the edge of your seat while tackling serious philosophical questions.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
328,JG_MovieCritic,Fantastic Four: Rise in Stan Lee's Finances,4,16 June 2007,"I've just been to see Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. You mustn't mistake my lack of disappointment as a praise of the movie, but instead understand that going in my expectations were so low that a movie sponsored by Orange would have got a sympathetic review.As might be suggested by the title, there is a new student in the class of poor Marvel movies, the Silver Surfer. Because the Surfer's powers are so extensive his debut appears could not be in a film all of his own due to budget constraints, so he was thrown in with the Fantastic Four. And I'm sure few people will be surprised when the man so subtly named Victor Von Doom reappears and, yes you guessed it, pretends to be good for a while before turning on our heroes.The cast is largely the same as the original with a few small changes, the most obvious being the added characters of General Hagar and the Silver Surfer. The Sufer's body is played by Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from Hellboy) and his voice by Laurence Fishburne. One might assume Fishburne has misplaced his body as this is the second movie this year in which he appears (or doesn't as the case may be) only as a voice. In terms of acting the original Four seem to have stayed on consistently poor form with the exception of Jessica Alba. This is a surprising turnaround for two reasons. Firstly the amount of Pseudo-Science jargon and unrealistic events increases exponentially with each lingering second. Secondly, she doesn't need to act at all to get the part in this movie or the next.Speaking of which the film is left open for a sequel (unfortunately for the audience the World did not end during this one) and I would like to suggest the title The Fantastic Four 3: A Steaming Pile of Dog Turd. This movie is more predictable than a fight between Woody Allen and the Ask a Ninja Ninja so I am giving it 4 shiny spacemen out of 10.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
329,jakey-d-1,REVIEW FOR NON COMIC BOOK FANATICS! *Potential Spoilers*,3,25 June 2007,"I'll start by stating my position on comic book movies. As I have never been into comic books but still have a soft spot for any type of dramatic hero, I always judge these movies on the basis of exactly what they are...movies! I do not care if things don't agree with the original comics.That said, what a waste of time! The acting is horrendously bad at times and has been served up with extra helpings of cheese. I'm sure that if the people who claim to have liked this installment watch it again they will agree. Special mention to Jessica Alba's portrayal of Little Miss Force Field, Sue Storm, which was horrible to be frank. An especially nasty moment would be her embarrassing spew near the end about 'protecting people.' However she is not on her own as most of the cast are quite frankly horrible this time around apart from one. Julian MacMahon is clearly an actor who is destined for huge things yet to come. Most people will recognise him from drama Nip/Tuck, but he clearly shows here that he is born to play a baddie. Every time he appeared on screen my spirits lifted a little but I wait patiently for the day he is offered a sinister role in a serious movie rather than one this is aimed for kids.However, acting is not the worst part of 4:Rise of the Silver Surfer. The plot is so idiotic is made my head spin. Spiderman movies have offered us a feast of baddies over the trilogy but sadly the writers of this movie served up a giant planet eating gas 'thingy' with a silver slave on a surfboard and expected us to swallow. Please don't think I'm being harsh as I was impressed by the Silver Surfer at the start, but the amazement fairly disappears when he loses his board becoming this pathetic wreck and won't stop talking in that annoying slow way. The reason for him and the gas ball being connected is kind of explained, but the reason for needing so many damn holes on the earth is not, the way I seem to be understand it only one hole was needed. And to conclude, just in case your not annoyed at wasting £6 on entry fee yet, the ending makes NO SENSE AT ALL! What exactly did he do to the big planet munching cloud? Maybe this is a 'need to read the comics' bit but it seemed to be so pointless and poor I was left thinking...""all that money on making this movie, and they end it like THAT!"" This 'plot' is also twisted around the sub plot of the Fantastic wedding, I won't discuss it because you'll spend enough time cursing it yourself when you have seen this movie.What about the CGI I hear you shout? Polished but pretty basic in my view.The Silver Surfer looks cool but not that cool and Reed's stetchiness looks really really fake most of the time. Of course I know it is fake but isn't it supposed to look real-ish? Take the Sandman is Spiderman 3 for example, his expanding looked cool and real...in fact, if good CGI was all you were wanting from this movie watch Spiderman 3 instead.ONE GOOD POINT OF 4: THE RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER: I witnessed a trailer for Transformers and that looks amazing!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

I have to say that it was quite enjoyable to watch. There were a few very minor things that didn't work out too well but the good things overruled the bad ones in this movie. 1. First of all, I have to say that Johnny was unbelievably hot. but, i was a little disappointed in Sue. In the first movie, her character was smart, AND pretty/hot. but in this movie, i felt as if something was lacking... i thought that she wasn't that pretty in this movie. i think she changed into a blond or did something.. but i liked her in the first movie better because in this movie i felt as if she acted a bit stupid instead of the smart girl we saw in the first movie. 2. I felt that the plot was quite good.. nothing much to criticize about the plot. it was great!3. character development... well.. it was alright in some parts. I thought that there wasn't enough chemistry between Reed and Sue. I definitely felt chemistry between Sue and the Silver Surfer.. ahah.. well. I also thought that Johnny has improved as a character. he's gotten more mature since the first movie. I also liked the fact that he could switch powers with the other that led him to defeat doctor doom.. that was THE coolest part ever.4. silver surfer. he was THE coolest thing the in the movie. his voice was so deep and good. and his powers are amazing. him and sue would make such a good couple.. but i hated it when he had to die in the end. =(overall.. i think this is one of the great movies i have seen. i have to say that spiderman 3 was about as good as this one! well.. i know I'm going to buy this movie later on when it comes out..

332,LinkfxTBP,Best Comic to Film Adaptation...I know that's a polarizing opinion,10,3 October 2007,"I am a well-read guy, in comics and literature, and I watch and make and own a lot of films, and I can confidently say I disagree with you. This movie knew what it was, pure popcorn comic book style family entertainment. It was able to take me back to being a kid again, something that none of the Spider-Man or X-Men movies were able to do. It reminded me of watching hours of cartoons as a kid and I mean that as the highest compliment. I know the first Fantastic Four film was terrible and poorly conceived, but this one really nailed it. It was tight, didn't stray from the narrative it was trying to tell, and kept to the main characters. I was constantly entertained and amazed by the performances, the witty banter and the amazing visual effects. I did not go into this movie expecting to like it. I am a cynic when it comes to film, I can pick apart Schindler's List or Gladiator to death. But not this film, it had a youthful spirit and energy and did not take itself seriously at all. I had a wonderful time watching this movie and again watching it twice on DVD. I don't know if it's a love it or hate it situation, but I loved it. I would recommend it to kids of all ages and comic book fans looking for that one movie that doesn't take the source material and try and turn it into Shakespeare. Not that there's anything wrong with Hamlet(especially the Branagh adaptation) or Romeo & Juliet(the Olivia Hussey one), or Macbeth. It's just that Spider-Man, Daredevil, Superman to some extent and X-Men have all tried to make us believe they are something they aren't and that takes the fun out of them. I don't include Batman in here because I believe that the story of Batman and the film adaptation in ""Begins"" is complex and articulate and I still found it thoroughly entertaining. But the point is these aren't hard stories to tell, and I like my authors to be straightforward with what they are trying to get across, which is why I'm such a big fan of this film, entertaining from beginning to end. Made me forget that I'm such a film cynic. 10/10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
333,Homer_J_Sherman,fantastic bore,3,20 June 2007,"""Fantastic Four"" is perhaps the worst of all the generally disappointing Marvel comics adaptations, even the worthless ""Daredevil"". The problem is in everything--the banal cast, the hammy acting, the insipid melodrama, the suspense-less plot, the inane subplots, the dorky storytelling style, the unimaginative action scenes, the lackluster special effects...The movie is too little-kid-oriented, and will likely not entertain anyone with teenage-and- above sensibilities. The only saving grace, honestly, is that Jessica Alba is hot. And even that is not true in this movie, wherein she wears creepy blue contact lenses and appears anorexic. She literally looks like a Barbie doll, and her character is about as boring.Oh yeah, the Silver Surfer is a character in this movie. The CGI animators only gave him one expression--inscrutable--which made him look like he was constantly bored...but perhaps I was just projecting.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
334,FlyDineSteve,Silver Surfer stole the show.,7,27 April 2019,"The follow up to the first F4 proves to be much more entertaining and engaging, good pace, good story line and none of those cliche script unlike the first one. Seeing it again after many years didn't let me down.Every time Silver Surfer appears, I'm mesmerised by his movement and body expression though he deserves a more important role than merely just a scouter for Galactus. Didn't do enough justice for him and Galactus to be honest. And that gas giant as Galactus is a big no no.Doug Jones played Silver Surfer deserves a massive applause. But the voice of Silver Surfer by Laurence Fishburne just sounded weird for the character. Could have just used Doug's voice and would fit better in my humble view.I hope now that F4 is back in the Disney/Marvel family, we can truly do justice for Silver Surfer and Galactus again. Laurence Fishburne as Galactus... now we're talking. They are so important for us Marvel fans. And please cast Doug Jones again, this time including his voice.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
335,retromcnugget,Better than FANTASTIC!,9,22 June 2007,"The first film kicked off pretty well, but I had high hopes for the best sequel to a Marvel film. In my opinion, the acting, action sequences and fighting was the best part. But what it missed for a perfect 10, was the unimpressive look of the CGI and the small portion of cheesy dialogue.Alba doesn't look too bad as a blonde, but there are scenes in the movie when she looked a bit ""fake"". The movie was a bit rushed though. I was expecting it to be longer but the movie still did good.There are parts in the film which are funny, but not too much of a big giggle. Best Marvel film I've seen in a while.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
336,jedi1007,"Fantastic Four: Fun, Fun, Fun, Fun",6,15 June 2007,"First, let's start with the bad news: The film is much too short. It clocked in at just about ninety minutes. The first film did a great job of laying the groundwork. Ideally, the second film should be the monumental epic. Director Tim Story certainly has a feel for the material, yet there is still the missing piece: the soul of the movie. The movie feels rushed and truncated. Next: the Galactus dilemma. With all of the CGI at their fingertips, and this was the best they could do for Galactus? I think this will be the major sore spot for many fans. One can't help but feel slighted by the producers concept of Galactus. If, as I have heard from the rumor mill, that the makers of the film are planning to unveil Galactus in either the next Fantastic Four or the Silver Surfer spin-off, then I suppose I could partly forgive them. After all, that has been the problem with so many comic book adaptations: too many villains. So, that brings us to the good news: FUN, FUN, FUN, FUN! Forget the negative reviews, this film is all about having a good time at the movies. Tim Story, as I have said, has a great feel for the material. He realizes that the essence of the Fantastic Four is rooted in the family dynamic. The chemistry between the Four is flawless. The writers understand that the theme is not just how the heroes deal with the enemy, but with each other as well. The humor that is derived from this set-up is spot on. One memorable scene has Johhny coercing Reed into a bachelor party. The camaraderie among the actors lends these scenes the credibility for the familial interaction. It's not just about buying into the special effects, it's about buying into the human aspects as well. I would like to have seen more of the Surfer. However, I suspect that will come in the aforementioned spin-off. True to the source material, we learn that the Surfer was once Norrin Radd. Otherwise, the effects are great, the cinematography awesome, and Story keeps the action going from start to finish. Basically, this a great summer, popcorn flick. It delivers the goods with much respect given to the source material. Highly recommended.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

He enjoyed it immensely, and laughed LOUDLY and gleefully at several moments (which I also laughed at - even though most of the humor was obvious). OK, OK, I will also admit to having a huge crush on Horatio Hornblower, I mean, Ioan G.Special effects in this film seemed easier to follow and more spectacular than in the recent Spiderman film. Plot was OK, and many dramatic moments you could see coming a mile away. I did appreciate the consistency of bringing back the bad guy from the first film, although how he survived is never explained. But for brisk, lightweight summertime fare this film is just fine.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
338,The_Mad_Maiden,An Insult To The Surfer,1,7 April 2009,"First of all I have to say this. I understand movies have to change things from their source materials. I can understand that. However when you go so far as to change the powers of the characters, well then we have a problem.When the first trailer for this movie came out I was thrilled. The Silver Surfer was one of my favorite hero's and the shots of the trailer were in fact...epic. As it came closer and closer to the release date my hopes of a good movie were brought higher as I realized Doug Jones, one of my favorite actors was playing the surfer.So when this opened I was extremely hyped to see. I was sure they couldn't possibly mess this movie up..Oh how wrong I was.I'm curious as to whether the writers did any research on the Silver Surfer what so ever. If they did they would have realized that his powers DO NOT come from his board. Let me repeat that.His powers.DO.NOT come from his board. I may sound like a whiny fangirl and I admit if that was just an aside I could accept it...However the entire plot of the movie is based on this idea. You can't just completely rewrite a characters powers like that. It just makes comic book fans mad and the people who aren't fans really confused when the talk about it to fans. Also, the Silver Surfer...can't bring people back from the dead. Of all the powers they have to give him one he never had in the first place.The acting was just plain bad. Making obvious attempts at getting a kid friendly film and yet finding a way to include the Susan Storm naked...yet again.And for a movie about the herald of Galactus, we sure don't see much of him. And what we do see is more like a cloud of dust then a feared being. Also (major spoilers here)since when has the Silver Surfer been able to destroy Galatus? I mean, he loses all powers just by having his board away and yet he can destroy the being that gave him the powers...with the powers...yeah, makes a whole lot of sense.The only redeeming features of this movie was the Surfer (when he had his powers). Jones was awesome and Laurence Fishburne did a good job with the voice. However that slight success is marred by the idea of how good it could have been if they'd stuck with the original story line.This is a movie that could've been great, it should've been great. But in the end it just ended up being a complete waste of time.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
339,dslbarney,How do I get back the time I spent watching this movie?,3,21 October 2007,"I recently saw both Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer and The Incredibles. I'm amazed at how badly Fantastic 4 handles what's in many ways a story that parallels a lot of The Incredibles. Both are superhero movies that takes a team with family members included to fight a super villain. Even though The Incredibles is only an animated film, I thought everything about it was much better. The plot in Fantastic Four is predictable and boring (I guarantee that you've seen almost everything in this movie before), while The Incredibles was imaginative and fun, with interesting characters, good pacing and some plot twists along the way. The worst part of Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is the acting: Jessica Alba looks and sounds like an overgrown, animated Barbie Doll, while Mr. Fantastic is played like a combination of Super Nerd and the most boring person you've ever met. The other actors are competent but hampered by the script. On the other hand, the suspension of belief that goes along with animation allowed for the superheroes in The Incredibles to seem more realistic. The plot and animation was so good that to me they seemed more human as well. Overall. avoid Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer and see The Incredibles instead.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

And it's that cohesive plot which really holds it together where other superhero sequels have failed. No unnecessary multiple villains or convoluted threads here, the film has a story to tell and tells it without getting bogged down by trying to do too much. The Fantastic Four themselves are all well characterized, especially the interplay between The Thing and Johnny Storm which is very reminiscent of the source material.Certainly it's cheesy but it's *fun* and at the end of the day that's exactly what a comic book superhero film should be.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
342,Kermit_stoned,Painful 4: The death of a series,1,31 August 2008,"I was reading through the other comments for this movie, and was very surprised when I actually found some positive remarks on this movie, so I decided to write a comment myself.First of all, I'm not a Fantastic 4 fan at all, so this is not a die hard review from a comic book fan, however this does not save the movie at all.There are actually more problems in this movie then can be explained in writing if you seek to understand what makes this movie hell on earth, I suggest you sit down and watch it, if you take this reviewers opinion on how bad it is I would however stay far far away from it.Problems: Jessica Alba's acting is worse then ever, its heart breaking to see such a nice piece of ass be so insanely bad at acting.Special effects where bad, and I mean REALLY bad, I know people have been saying that ""uhh the silver surfer was sooo shiny"", well pal of mine that doesn't mean squad. IF you want to base an entire movie on special effects they better be up to the challenge, but they aren't special effects in most computer games are way better.Flame on looks like a yellow retard with goofy lights shining.The Thing still looks like a jelly man, not at all convincing that he is made of stone.Mr. Fantastic, has a horrifying dancing scene that will make you puke bad effects for a week.But if the special effects, and the acting weren't bad enough, the plot tops them all delivering a mindblowingly bad story. Alba's char. is so badly developed that she is plain annoying, she worries more about her marriage then the end of the earth, Goodjob for a superhero woman. And to be honest I really can't remember the ending except the good guys winning, don't know how, I saw this movie once when it came out, and I actually forgot ever seeing it, so when i saw it again today, I felt like when big bad dejavu ala. Matrix changing my death from a car accident, to drowning.I must say, if they manage to scoop up another billion dollar for another painful film, I would be very surprised, and I really hope it doesn't happen, cause damn we deserve to be rid of painful big budget movies like this piece of crap. This is worse then when Joel Schumacher destroyed (atleast for a time) the Batman series, until our savior Nolan came along.There is a small chance for saving this shitty series, hire Nolan, fire A lot, and kill of some actors...

343,jgbreezer,Soulless fun,4,12 June 2007,"Why soul-less? Throughout the whole movie, I didn't really feel connected to the characters or their fate. Trying to analyse this, I think it's that they don't go very deep into anyone's psyche at any point; there's the different characters and you have an idea of the kind of people they are, but no one makes you take a deep look at any of them. When insights are given, they're rather thrown in and glossed over as though someone thought the film ought to have some more substance.The silver surfer is very cool, and the Fantastic Four's powers are believably and seamlessly animated (I can't remember/never really saw the 1st movie to compare to). It was more predictable than the average Hollywood blockbuster (oops is that a spoiler? :-), and personally I'm not sure I like Jessica in blonde, not sure it quite suits her skin colour.I had to think whether to knock it down to 4 from 5 (which I almost gave it) but in the end, I'm estimating the novelty-gain factor (ie. how you rate it having just seen it 1st time compared to the longer term view). Not a complete panning, but don't look for more than good special-effects and Jessica Alba being hot. No doubt big F4 fans will be commenting on everything that's different compared to the comics, I went with a friend who knew them. Still kind of a fun movie though, of the throwaway sort, which saves it a little.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
344,kallizmartin,"Good lord, what a piece of garbage",1,1 July 2007,"This movie is awful in every degrading sense of the word. I hated it, and I honestly can not understand how anyone above the age of 11 can like this. I realize that it is a movie for children, but does that mean that the movie should be bad, because children does not have a fully developed sense of what is good and what is not? ""Let's just make a movie without really caring about the outcome, because children love famous and pretty people, and doesn't know a bad story from a good one, so they'll be happy no matter what!"" - Tim Story I can envision the director telling the crew this in the beginning of production. The direction was below average, and it was quite evident because the whole movie felt like a string of random scenes cut together, with way too much focus on all sorts of stupid things that had nothing to do with the story. Why did they put the scene with the bear in there, for example? Was it important? No, it certainly was not, let me tell you.The acting was as well lousy. The worst of the lot was Jessica Alba. Sure, she's a pretty face, but nothing more, but I suppose they put her in the FF-movies because of just that. The others in the ensemble are better than her, but that doesn't make them good. Chris Evans was OK in Sunshine, so why did he decide to suck in this one? I don't get it. Another thing, if Galactus was so powerful, and he was the one who gave the Surfer his powers, then why would the Silver Surfer be able to destroy Galactus just by surfing into him? Seems the Devourer of Planets would handle something like that. While I'm on the subject, a villain in the form of a silvery man on a surfboard is just stupid. I'm just gonna end this review now, because this movie frankly isn't worth commenting on anymore - it is a very, very bad movie and you should be able to tell (but judging from the comments on the official MySpace-page to the film, most people might not realize it)if your IQ is higher than your waist measurement.

345,nukthepoor,Wow that was terrible,2,30 June 2007,"Personally I was not a big fan of the original movie although I did not hate it. This one I did hate. The only thing other than the surfer who was intriguing, that was any fun was looking at Jessica Alba and that was not even executed very well. Personally when there was any dialogue it was hard not to laugh at how bad the delivery and writing were. The first half-hour of this movie was the worst half-hour of my life. I cannot stand when movies try to pretend their is any emotional story, because these actors were in no way good enough to carry out any emotions. This movie should have involved all one liners and explosions. Because that is what it is good at, before you pass judgement I am not some adrenaline junkie and I thought the one-liners in the movie were awful. I am a huge movie fan, and I do like action but usually I watch more dramatic movies with actual quality plot and acting. I just think that movies like this should just give the idiotic mass audience what it wants and skip out on the plot. Also this may have been the most predictable movie I have ever seen. I tried to bet a friend of mine during the movie on exactly how the movie would turn out and I was exactly correct although he refused the bet, because he said I would probably be right. I just had to get a few things off my chest and since this was the first summer sequel I have see I may just skip the rest. The romantic subplots were not only pointless and emotionless, but also so contrived I felt like vomiting.I give it a 2 because the surfer was a cool character, and I felt like being generous.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

I fully expected this film to be a fairly straight forward special effects/humour driven movie and not to be taken too seriously and that is what it was. Unlike Spiderman 3 and Ghost rider, which should have been much darker/serious films but ended up being fairly cheesy affairs (was there really any need for the whole singing and dancing thing in Spiderman?) this film was just good fun and I came away satisfied.

The best performance was by a computer-generated character, and the attempts at humour would be intellectually insulting to an imbecile. I can only assume Chiklis, Braugher, and Fishburne needed to make their mortgage. If the camera had spent the 85 minutes locked on Jessica Alba's rear, there would have been more action, more comedy, more emotion and lot more entertainment than this thing had.

The film is perfectly paced; It's not so fast that you can't keep up but not so slow that you regret not sleeping through the first 20 minutes of the movie. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm keeps the dialog witty and easy with the aid of his easy to bruise rock-buddy Ben Grimm.

Well, at first it did seem better than I imagined, although it soon turned out to be JUST AS lame as I imagined. Lol.The special effects are all unrealistic and looks like some video game, except maybe the chase of Silver Surfer guy that was previewed in the trailer. Nothing surprised me. Nothing excited me. The movie had a few laughs, some mocked-up ""last battle against evil"" scene, but nothing could be called memorable or cool.The main heroes did get some development, but I think even Spidey 3 could surpass this film here (and yes, that's bad). Actually, those few emotional problems characters are facing seem remarkably similar to Peter Parker's ones (wedding, overconfidence), although this movie doesn't see anything bad about being overconfident in the end.Well I'd say you may go to this movie only if you want to KILL time. It doesn't have anything in it. It's shallow, and you will probably spend your time chatting with the girl on the right. As I did, in fact.

Now, when Human Torch explains the figure to The Thing, he says ""Great. Now why don't you tell us about the Lollypop junction?!"" It's so stupid that I was laughing for nearly three minutes.

Doctor Doom is adapted incredibly poorly compared to his interesting character in the comic books. And everything just feels so down the middle and bland, where 20th Century Fox compiled scenes and basically told the filmmakers (and I use filmmakers loosely) to surround the movie around those scenes and not make a disaster (like the Josh Trank one). And if we're talking about an incredibly safe and generic superhero movie, Fantastic Four 2005 achieves that...barely.When it comes to the sequel many of the same flaws of the original are definitely in this, except there are a couple of things about this movie that are actually interesting or well-done (shocking I know). When we're talking about things that are interesting, I would say the Silver Surfer is an incredibly interesting character and the way his surf board controls his powers and his entire life force is interesting. And it makes way for an action scene that actually has a purpose and technique instead of ""We have to stop the bad guy"" like from the first movie. Also, the character of Silver Surfer is incredibly well-voice-acted by Laurence Fishburne, who makes the character of the Silver Surfer kind of mysterious, interesting character who sadly sacrifices himself at the end of the movie (I use ""sadly"" because he's the most interesting character).When it comes to things that are well-done, this movie (unlike the first one) actually has character development and an arc for one of our four main characters, Johnny Storm. Johnny Storm goes from the young, brash kid he was in the first one, to having an arc where he decides and realizes he needs to finally grow up if he's going to be a hero that people can count on. And he does by the end of the film, which was incredibly surprising in revisiting this film.But, the rest of the movie is as bad as the first one, where Doctor Doom is still the same uninteresting bad guy. Who by the way we know is going to betray everyone in the end, and for some reason they decide to trust him. The acting is bland as hell, except for Chris Evans and Laurence Fishburne who are the saving graces of this movie, with Chris Evans being the saving grace for both movies. Which makes sense why they've been incredibly successful in Hollywood before and after this movie, and Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, and Michael Chiklis, and Julian McMahon have all sort of fallen into direct to DVD garbage or failed TV shows (although Jessica Alba made a successful business, so she doesn't really count). In addition, the character writing for everyone but Johnny and the Silver Surfer is poorly done, where the rest of the Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom have simplistic character traits that represent their characters for both movies. The special effects are solid, with the Silver Surfer effect being amazing in my opinion. The action scenes can't really be called well-directed or poorly directed because they are all made in computers, but they are overall better than the first movie.It's been said to death, but Galactus was completely wrong, but he only shows up with 10 minutes left in the movie so I don't think it's that annoying.In conclusion, Rise of the Silver Surfer is a bad movie, but it's better than the first one, because there are actually interesting and well-done things about it. But, considering the very short length of the movie relative to big blockbusters then and nowadays, it's an easy watch that is not too long for an adult to sit through, and short enough for a kid to pay attention all the way through",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
359,twisted_little_star84,Fantastic indeed,10,12 August 2007,"Let me first say that I have never read a single comic book of Fantastic Four and I have no idea how the movie pays respect to the comic book. From a simple movie lover (I really am) point of view I thought the movie kicked ass! I loved how they made the characters real and not over the top (well, not over the top for an action/sci-fi movie that is). This is one sequel that is better than the first. Everything is improved in terms of better/bigger story, better cgi, better and more impressive actionsequences. The performance from the actors are just what you expect for this kind of movie. None of the actors are gonna win any awards, but is just believable enough. The Silver Sufer is amazing to watch. I really believed he was for real.Now everybody here (almost) complains about Galactus being a storm, but I really thought that was a great twist. Even though this movie is about a silver alien on a spaceboard it has to have roots in reality. Had Galactus been there in his comic book form it would have been too over the top and cheesy. Also I really liked the Doom story line. I think he should have had a bigger role but there is always number three too fix that.I expect almost every person here to disagree with me, but I give this movie top score. It entertained the hell out of me and I look forward to the next movie.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Yes, you have to ignore some obvious holes in the story & plot but so what? It's a flippin' comic book! That's how it's supposed to be.The Silver Surfer character was really well done. My eyes were locked to the screen when he was on. The Fantastic 4 were all about the same. Alba changed her look too much, though. VonDoom's return was pointless. The army general or whoever he was was laughable.But again, you shouldn't see this if you're looking for an engaging story & deep acting. Just appreciate the Silver Surfer & how fast pace of the movie. It's refreshingly slim compared to the bloated blockbuster action films of 2007.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
361,brechtbug,The Fantastic Four Stooges #2 - Why do they even bother,2,16 June 2007,"I just got back from seeing ""Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer"". Wow, it's just as bad as the first film. I wanted to like it but it just didn't happen. What a mess. I was hoping the Silver Surfer element would make a better movie but it's just as problematic as the previous one. For starters the first three things I like to see in an action/comedy film with superheroes is 1) a scene on a plane where people bicker about riding coach instead of first class. 2) a scene where people bicker whether or not to go to a bachelor party. And 3) a scene where people bicker about someone not taking a wedding seriously enough. But wait, these are three things I don't want to see in an action/comedy film with superheroes. Yeah, that must be it. It's not that I don't like the Fantastic Four comic or its characters, I just want to have something about the characters that I should care about. They can argue and be funny but that's not all they should be doing. I like Michael Chiklis as the Thing & I like Chris Evans as Johnny Storm and that's it. Jessica Alba as Sue Storm just always seems kinda bitchy, Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards seems slightly indecisive (tho in this film FF2 he's acting a little more like a leader) Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters doesn't get the chance to even mention she's a sculptress and I don't know what the hell Julian McMahon as Von Doom is doing besides being a jerk. If you want to see someone who could play Dr. Doom watch Peter Wyngarde as Klytus in the 1980 film ""Flash Gordon"". That's the closest to Doom on film that anyone is going to get.The CGI for the Surfer looked good but give him a flashback to something in his life that he cares about or wants to protect and maybe he'll come off a little less aloof. If he's getting his own spin off movie he'd better get a lot more interesting but fast.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
362,fury7767,"Fantastic Four; Rise of the Silver Surfer, a good family flick",7,16 June 2007,"Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. What can you really say about it, the title says it all. This movie was more then just a sequel though; it portrays the characters even closer to the characters in the comic books. Reed Richards played by Ioan Gruffudd begins to start showing that he's the leader of the Fantastic Four as intended his character in the comic books. Human Torch played by Chris Evans, still the cocky self-centered underwear model role from the first movie, but hey, thats the role we love about him. Susan Storm played by Jessica Alba, once again she finds herself exposedliterally, to the public. And lastly Michael Chiklis as our lovable orange monster ""The Thing"", who will never stop to amaze us.But, the real story here, the Silver Surfer played by none other then Doug Jones with the voice of Laurence Fishburne. First off, Doug Jones is one actor in my opinion that does not get enough credit for the roles that he plays. We all loved him in Hellboy as our blue fish friend Abe Sapien, and now with his amazing role as the Silver Surfer. After all the Fantastic Four movies are complete, he deserves his own Silver Surfer movie with a healthy budget to give it what we want.Character development is similar to that of the first Fantastic Four. The chemistry between The Thing and Johnnie Storm is there, also with a new story added in of a wedding for Richard Reed and Susan Storm. However, in my opinion, though the wedding story was interesting and amusing at times it did tend to drag on which ate up lots of screen time that could have possible been used for some neat fight scenes with the Surfer. But all-in-all I don't see anybody getting nominated for a razzie this time around which is a positive.With a finally note, Not the best movie to come out this summer, But it also wasn't terrible either. Amusing, entertaining, a few good creative laughs and very well done special effects. What more could one ask for.So if you happen to be looking for a good movie to take your spouse and kids to and you enjoyed the first Fantastic Four, then I'd highly recommend Fantastic Four; Rise of the Silver Surfer.And keep a watch in the future for the next Fantastic Four, and quite possible fighting along side with the Silver Surfer or in his own Major Motion Picture.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
363,TheDarkPhoenix85,Nothing here has risen folks.,4,24 July 2007,"After the critics and comic-book aficionados gave the first Fantastic Four film a ""bitchslap"" of bad reviews, it became a surprise hit nonetheless. But some of you already knew there was going to be a sequel on the way. And since there were a lot of mistakes made, there must've been some lessons learnt from everyone involvednot that they could care less about ""negative reception"", since the movie has made 330 million worldwide. 2 years later, the promise that the sequel will be darker (so they say), and more serious (so they say), have been hype to death, though this is the same hype that has damaged both Spider-Man 3 and X3. Then, there's the publicity stills of the Silver Surfer as the next FF baddie, helping me leave my lowered expectations behind. I decided to give this one another shot, and that's because the Silver Surferwho is one of the coolest Marvel creations ever. Rise of the Silver Surfer is an improvement over the first film (And that's saying a lot for those of you who have ever seen the first film), since its source material is a reasonable one. The Fantastic Four must save Earth after the Silver Surfer, who is the herald of the planet eating being Galactus, signals it's destructionwhile Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman prepare for their upcoming nuptials. Seems fair doesn't it? This could've worked, but the problem is that a brief 96 minutes running-time isn't enough to pull it all off. How are you going to pull off an ""Independence Day"" under 96 minutes? Not only is the running-time a huge problem, but the film is just too lackluster for me to fancy. And because of everything being so brief, arbitrary and perfunctory, there's wasn't enough action, fighting, or confrontational battles between the heroes & their foe(s). This is a film about an extraterrestrial being coming to destroy Earth, but you don't see too many things being blown up; devastation of landscapes or set pieces with an atmosphere filled with intensity, peril or panic: all of the things that can give this film a dramatic affect. Like the first FF film, FF2's suffers from a limited imagination, and I honestly think that Tim Story lacks the vision that it takes to handle such material that's supposed to be filled with thrills, excitement, darkness, drama, and for the faithfulness to the FF camplight-hearted ""fun"". The ""over-hyped"" nuptials of Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman turned out to be a disappointing subplot, due to the fact that it's just a set-up for the Surfer to have his first encounter with the heroes by intruding on the ceremony. Though I was hoping they could get it over withsince it has taken up most of the film's time; they have been yapping about it throughout the entire film. But thank god Stan Lee came to make his usual cameo appearance. Was it light-hearted? Yes. Seeing as how there's a goofy dance number with Reed Richards, and the typical slapstick momentswhich one scene includes Sue's body helplessly rendered in flames because of Johnny's molecules being unstable after his encounter with the Surfer, causing him to switch powers with anyone he touches. Was it funny? Nope. Chris Evans (Human Torch/Johnny Storm) is typically ""comedic relief"" with all the dull-witted jokes he can carry, but tries to make it work with decent delivery. Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm/The Thing) isn't given much to do here but stand behind and be the goofball. The attempt at tenderness between Sue Storm/Invisible and Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is unrealistic, with both the film's hackneyed script and the lack of chemistry between Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd. Whenever these folks are supposed to kiss and show affection, it seems rather forced then natural. Alba (now looking like Lil' Kim with her blonde-hooker wig and scary-looking blue contact lenses), is just cold and uninteresting for me to stomach. It seems that she is always in this emotionless state. It's like she's this walking mannequin: she does nothing, but stand around, look hot, and wear tight-fitting outfitswhile wearing eye-glasses to give off the effect that she has some sort of intellectwithout the intellectual babble (doh!). The script does nothing to help her express her words, but she doesn't have the altitude to express emotion either. Gruffudd seems to always be in this state of lost. It's quite difficult to understand why such an amazingly gifted actor can be so boring in this film. Were any of the heroes fantastic this time? Not a chance. The Fantastic Four are treated are bland super-dummies, while their nemesis, the Silver Surfer, upstages all them in terms of awesomeness and coolness. Too bad this isn't his movie. The Silver Surfer rocked, no doubt about it, and brought to life by amazing special effects, he's even more fantastic then the four who carry the moniker. Do we really need Julian McMahon returning as Dr. Doom? People have truly underestimated him in the first film, but here, he doesn't provide much for the story, while the idea of the big bad-ass Galactus turning into a dust storm doesn't work. My advice for the next installment 1.) Let see these guy do more fighting 2.) Let these characters show their full potential when they perform their super-powers. 3.) Never let the next FF baddie cramp the heroes' style 4.) Enough with Doom 5.) And please upgrade on the special effects, they still look cheapeven for a big-budget film.Of course, this is supposed to be a ""light-hearted"" family film, and like a Diet Coke it's ""Half"" the calories (PG folks)while the hardcore comic-book fans with avoid it like the plaque. They deserve better. And by the title being Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, it's really more about the Silver Surfer. In the good words of wisdom from Flava Flav: ""Don't believe the hype.""",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

365,redjellydonut,One of the worst movies I've ever paid money to see,1,15 June 2007,"It's been 30 years since Star Wars rewrote the action movie rulebook. In the intervening years we've been treated to a whole slew of great SF movies. Comic books and graphic novels have been especially well represented, with Batmen, Supermen, and Spidermen showing us how action movies are supposed to be made. Last night, we were treated to an example of how not to make an action movie. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is not just the opposite of a great action movie, it is the opposite of decent film-making of any kind. The ways in which this movie goes wrong can be measured by the different crafts that go in to the making of all movies. The script, the actual words that these poor actors are forced to utter, are among the worst of any mainstream American movie I've ever seen. To call them trite is to undersell the vapidity of the sentiments expressed by dialogue. The emptiness of the script is compounded by some of the worst directing ever. The awfulness of the dialogue is brought in to relief by the agonizingly slow pacing that gives the viewer way too much time to contemplate the inanity that comes out of each character's mouth.The special effects are just plain cheap. They're Star Trek: TMP kinda bad. It would take a studio with an awful lot of contempt for the audience to settle for what passes as CGI in this misbegotten mess.I'm not sure who this film was made for. If it's made for kids, the studio may be in for a bit of a disappointment. The great crop of movies American kids have been raised on will likely have prepared them for something a lot better than this. Kids aren't stupid. They know when they're being sold an inferior product and there's plenty of good diversions out there for them to have to settle for grade D crap like FF:ROTSS.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
366,protwitch,But it's Dolce?,8,31 July 2019,"I can understand why people do not enjoy this film. Galactus was 'portrayed' by a space-cloud, some of the characters are dry, Dr Doom is a bit boring and the Human Torch at the end of the film basically carries the team. But over the years this film has grown on me, and when I watch it now I find it a thoroughly enjoyable experience, even if it is perhaps for the wrong reasons! We simply have to address the famous Mr Fantastic dance scene. I can see why he is called Mr Fantastic; Richard read that situation like an encyclopaedia, and utilised his powers for their true purpose: dance! His moves inspire me when I go out and hit the clubs, though of course I am by no means comparable.Let us not forget the quick quotes firing from the Human Torch. ""Go online and place your bets"", ""it's Dolce"", and his admiration for the Silver Surfers Powers are all brilliantly executed by Chris Evans, and it makes me wish he would reprise his role as Human Torch in the MCU future, though we know that will not happen.This film is certainly a questionable one and I have to be honest and admit it does have flaws, which many other cinematic connoisseurs would see as enough to result in a dismissal of this film's ever present great qualities. I however must be honest with myself as well, and be upfront and admit that I love this film a great amount, and may even grow to love it more.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

It was MUCH better then the first one, but by no means a good movie.. Wooden acting and zero chemistry plagued this one from the on start. The script was pedestrian and made previous fantastic four mythology a JOKE. Come on, they made Galactus a cloud? He was only the most powerful character in the marvel universe and all he gets is a whimpy cloud.. Whats up with that? On that note, I would definitely say this is a must watch on VIDEO or cable.

368,jnjenfield,Not as Fantastic as Spider-Man,6,12 July 2007,"If the scenes with the Silver Surfer weren't so great, I'd have given the film three stars. The other bright spot in the film is Chris Evans who does a good job playing Johnny Storm. WETA, Spectral Motion and The Orphage do an amazing job bringing the characters to life. What they can do with CGI and prostethics these days is incredible. It's too bad that the writing and the acting couldn't have been as good.I think it's a more and more common problem as they are making movies that are more and more technical. They spend so much time and effort making the special effects that acting seems to be an after thought in films like this. The Star Wars Prequels are another prime example. Great effects but wooden and lack luster acting for the most part.Avi Arad did a much better job on Spider-Man I and II than he did on the Fantastic Four movies. Maybe that's because there were more character development scenes and fewer cgi infused fight scenes in the Spidey movies.I love Laurence Fishbourne's voice so I was happy to hear it for the Silver Surfer. The credits say some guy named Doug Jones played the Surfer. He must have done the motion capture for the computer animators since Surfer looked CG the whole time. The most amazing costuming in the film was Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm. I bet it took hours to get all that orange rock on him. People criticize poor Michael for a poor performance but I don't see how he was able to perform as well as he did with all that stuff on. You try to emote with a face covered in foam (or whatever that stuff was).It was an entertaining film, but the needless changes from the comic such as all of the Surfer's power being in the board when it never was in the comics, the lackluster acting and the unfunny jokes kept it from being as good as it could have been.

I got really tired of the bickering about the wedding stuff. There was way too much dialog about the wedding and not enough action. I got really bored.Then it got stupid. I don't mind it when a movie walks a little off the path of science. Part of the plot revolves around a new super-weapon that is supposedly designed to help defeat the enemy. Somebody mumbles something about the fact that it uses ""Neutrinos"" (btw Neutrinos are something you would see in Star Trek or something...). Nobody explains anything about it, how it works or what it is going to do. You just have to suspend your disbelief and accept it works. This is a sign of a poor plot and bad planning.I liked some of the humor, though.

371,nachtkriec,The True Believers must speak out,4,16 June 2007,"OK......... ten pages, and nothing good yet.We true believers, the real fans of the comic book, the ones who know and understand the stories of the comics, have a few things to say.This movie is yet another example of Hollywood's lack of sense. I enjoyed Lord of the Rings thoroughly, I enjoyed the Spiderman series for the most part, I enjoyed Batman Begins to its core, but this movie portrays the greatest blunder of Hollywood has ever made.You see, what draws us nerds into science fiction and fantasy is at least our appreciation for the science or the ""properties"" of the powers of various persons, always wondering how possible these powers might be. But what keeps us around is the sheer greatness of the unfolding drama. They are simply great stories. Granted, they often involve corny villains and silly logic, but we do not regard these as much. There are actually some incredible stories to be told in these comics. What we mean when we say ""does it do it justice?"" is, ""is the story as good a story as it should be?"" Are these movies as moving as the stories they are supposed to represent? Or are they a mere show for the disillusioned audience who know nothing of Galactus' true power? or Phoenix's? What I'm trying to say is, if Hollywood would actually take the time to read and understand what has made the stories so popular, then their movies would be more than just a bunch of action and worn-out romance/villain/solution plot. Hollywood fails to UNDERSTAND the basics of the marvel universe.There is one complaint i have against this movie. I had up to 20 in some others, but I still sang their praises.The Surfer CANNOT ""tell"" Galactus he is done. The Surfer humbly requests that Galactus spares this planet. There is no massive heave of power or grand rebellion. The surfer has plenty of balls enough to stand up to Galactus enough to plead for one being's life. And Galactus, not wanting to have a resentful herald, tells him to find another herald for him, and he will go. There is no ""It is over, for both of us."" Galactus is one of the three GODS of the marvel universe. if you fail to portray Galactus correctly, you fail to make a good story. The drama behind this story is not that ""though they are small, they prevail."" The drama is quite different and more subtle. The drama is that ""EARTH IS DOOMED."" No matter how much heart they have in them, they are forced to face the inevitable fact that there is absolutely nothing they can do to stop Galactus from eating Earth. It is only in the Surfer's EXILE to earth and Frankie Ray's appointment as Herald that Earth is saved. I suppose there is yet hope with another movie, but we are damn tired of waiting for ""the next movie."" If Galactus is screwed up, then there are too many other stories down the line that will be screwed up.What Hollywood needs to start doing is incorporating the different superheroes in each others movies. This is the most important thing in comic books. The Marvel Universe, and the DC Universe, and even both of them together, are The Most Detailed and Complex Stories of All Time. One of the reasons Lord of the Rings is so popular is because it is so extensive. Comic books are so ten-thousandfold. Holly wood needs to understand this.In conclusion: I call Bruce Timm to the stand. Bruce Timm, I honour you. Although Justice League and Batman and all that (even Static Shock) are not necessarily completely on target with the comics, you have successfully understood the nature of each and every character, and the nature of the comic book story. This is what has made them so damn popular. They're damn good stories. I exhort you to force yourself into the next comic book movie (DC i guess) and show Hollywood what a REAL comic book movie is like. Show them that they can actually have a decent plot and have actually interesting characters. Let the world know that we nerds and geeks actually have something going here. SHow them that *SHOCK* comic books are worthy of a place among Charles Dickens and J. K. Rowling and Homer. And your movie will outsell anything Hollywood can put out. Bruce Timm, you MUST make a movie. Do it for me. Do it for all of us. Do it for the sake of true beauty and for the sake of true art. Do it so we can read Paul the Apostle's words ""whatever is noble, honourable, and just"" and think about the movie we just saw.It's about quality, ya'll.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
372,Master_Rebellion,"Entertaining, but I expected more.",7,16 June 2007,"Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer was a good movie. I enjoyed watching it and I wasn't bored at all. However, I felt a mix of thoughts and feelings at the beginning. It seemed to be fast and slow at the same time. Allow me to elaborate.Now if you didn't see the preceding title: Fantastic Four, or if you aren't familiar with the comics, then you may be a bit confused at the beginning. There is hardly an introduction for the characters, making you feel as though you missed something important. You'll catch on though; nothing to really worry about. The events were filled with dialog at the beginning, and knowing what type of movie this is, you await the action. The action won't come until later on, and even then it seems to end a bit quickly.A slight problem I had was that the movie attempted to be dramatic and catastrophic. The keyword being: attempted. The world is coming to an end because of the Silver Surfer's invasion, but I didn't feel emotionally drawn into the moments that transpired. In some movies, you can actually feel what the characters are feeling in their moments of strife. You can identify with them, and even compare the experiences with your own. However, this movie lacked that ability. What I'm trying to say is that it felt too much like a movie, and not like something that you can identify with. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I expected this movie to give me that mental and emotional connection that I spoke of.The best thing about this movie is the characters. Each character has a unique relationship with the other, and it makes for an amusing experience, even though it attempts to be ""touching."" But in concern with the actors who play the characters, there is nothing about their performances that will blow you away. It was satisfactory, but not excellent.If you're looking for an entertaining but not too profound film, then I would suggest this movie to you. It wasn't at all bad. It just didn't live up to my expectations. It was good, but I dare say it was fantastic.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
373,mad4tonic,Best Comic adaptation since Batman Begins... nice to see some sustained action in a comic movie,7,23 June 2007,"Well, well, well. FF2 was the best comic book adaptation since Batman Begins. A marked improvement on the first. better mix of action and humour. less cheese, more grit. it still has it shortfalls, like the Silver surfer's trademark ""to me, my board"" being omitted (and it should have been there when he retrieved his board), and Galactus being an f-ing cloud, but in general, in short ... it was adrenaline fuelled awesome-ness!!! From the start, straight into the action. None of this character introduction bull. There is no need for it. The vast majority of people going to watch this type of film will know the characters already, and audiences aren't stupid. Action movies that work are ones that kick the adrenaline in early, and build the characters as the plot goes on. It's a little thing i like to call subtext and subtlety (in terms of characters). Marvel and DC should get to know these words if they hope to achieve successful movies.Remember, full on action from the start, no holds barred, for two hours, and you're made. Want an example, The Matrix. Action from the get-go, small stops to catch your breath, and pile on the action again.And that was why this movie worked. Timing was greatly improved from the first movie. Good periods of action, drama and humour. As i said an excellent mix of action, with the right balance of CGI, and much better dialogue and actually good humour. It was intertwined better than the previous film. It still has bad points, but i left the cinema content, and with a smile. Worth the price of admission for sure, and that is the golden ticket in my eyes.it gets AG's Two thumbs up seal of approval.

He's perfectly transfered from the books to the screen and that was one of the thing i feared, one of the most powerful heroes being badly put to the big screen but it wasn't the case so 2 thumbs up i'm very happy.The fantastic four, well the development of the characters continue slowly but surely as we now see invisible women and Mr.Fantastic getting married and you know what Ben and Johnny becoming buddies but still taunting each other again 2 thumbs up !! Storyline, when you read the books you find a lot of similarities like surfer ""surfing"" through the cosmos and finally finding earth, the next planet he will offer to his master ""the world devourer"" Galactus. Ine the books, like i said things are a bit different but since at the end you are clued that the surfer will be back, so will be Galactus and the Watcher (well i hope he'll be there).Cons: Galactus. My only disappointment in this movie and the only reason i didn't put a 10. How can such a powerful character can be represented by... Clouds and a shadow of the infamous helmet ??? As far as i'm concerned if you want to keep the suspense, instead of showing him like this at the end of the movie, show instead his Starship arriving in our Galaxy at blaze speed and let us hear him say ,before the ending credit, something that ""prepares the table"" for the third installment but, being wiped like that ?? OK the Surfer's strong but from whom does he gets his power ? Come on.Dr.Doom, Well it is more a suggestion... if you planned to not show Galactus then Doom should have go one-on-one of with the surfer now you'll say hey what about the fantastic four ? Well while the surfer's fighting doom, you can see them helping people in the city since Doom did a lot of mess. That's my opinion...Add let's say 15 minutes for this ? The movie's length would have been around 1h45.*********** end of spoilers ************ Overall still a good movie and pllllllllllllllllllease for the third installment... oh well, you know who i want to see :-)8 out of 10",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
375,hubble_no_1,Sci-Fi Highschool comedy,5,28 August 2007,"There have been a LOT of Marvel/Mutant/Superhero-movies produced lately, and the quality ranges from ""really stinking bad"" (Daredevil someone?) to ""Whoopaaa!"" (X-men 1). So is the sequel to the first mediocre Fantastic 4 movie a new blockbuster? Unfortunately, the answer is NO. There is no tension in this film, what so ever. Despite the fact that the world stands before a great peril, there is no feeling of despair, no sense of danger or even some signs that the members in the fantastic four feel a little uncomfortable.Effects are good and the Silver-Surfer himself looks really cool. Jessica Alba is so over-the-edge sweet that you could slice her up and sell her as candy. But in the end, this is nothing than a Highschool old fashion comedy about the nerd and the good looking girl wrapped up in a little Sci-Fi and spiced with some nonsense science.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
376,lovekh,Decent,6,19 June 2007,Interesting but for me it was a let down of sorts. I understood the storyline of Sue and Reed's marriage failures but it seemed a little forced to created a possible separation of the team that last a good 5 minutes...that should have been drawn out more.I enjoyed that Reed finally took charge of the team...what he says goes in this one...this was Truly Mr. Fantastic.What disappointed me was Galactus...I wanted to see him....or something more compelling than a cloud of radiation. I understand that movies have to be written a certain way to make them feasible but the one thing that makes Spiderman very successful is that Raimi sticks to the comic story line...Galactus does not die in the original story...why not stick to it....for me it was a big let down to see how it all played out.,Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
377,koverartsnet,This truly bites hard,2,7 July 2007,"This movies commits every ""sin"" that can be done to a film based on a ""comic book."" It's the ""comic"" part that confuses film people.Campy humor and self aware parody are just sad when the original stories didn't have any of this. Its like the writers are embarrassed to be working on a movie based on a ""comic"" and so they have to stick in the snickering crap so that everybody realizes that the writers ""know."" This one doesn't go as far as the old TV version of Batman, (BIFF-POW) but still cheapens the story with too much juvenile fluff.Why rework the characters and give them different personalities rather than use what has been developed for so many years? Why not cast people that resemble the characters? Jessica Alba is very tasty but her complexion is too dark to make sense as a blond, and her ""brother Johnny"" has an entirely different coloring. Alba looks oddly enough, like a Latina with a bleach job. The Storms are both blonds, cast two blonds & be done with it. Or in the name of PC diversity, make both Storms Latino, but pulease don't mix em...The ""Thing"" is all rubber, so there is no reason why he doesn't look like the original Thing. Seems like Stan Lee has been distancing himself from Jack Kirby since Jack died... The look of the originals are indebted to Kirby and I think Stan wants to gloss over that fact & take all of the credit.Why essentially dump Galactus, and insert Dr. Doom without his characteristic man/machine look? Why is Doom even in this???The story of the Silver Surfer & Galactus is awesome in the classic use of the word and intense of a grand scale. Why rewrite that story & downplay the most visually impressive elements? Simplify the story sure, but why turn Galactus into an amorphous cloud? ? ? A little filmic license is to be expected, but when you remove the elements that could have made a bigger, better movie, and replace them with funny business, and weak cgi - the you end up with tripe like this stinker.A not so Fantastic Four...",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
378,victor-arulraj,Last but not least for this summary release,6,13 June 2007,"With a livelier script and stronger production values, this sequel far outdoes the 2004 original. Funnier comedy, more interesting characters and much slicker effects work make it a terrific guilty pleasure.The Fantastic Four are having trouble balancing their professional and personal lives. Reed and Sue (Gruffudd and Alba) can't get married without being interrupted by a crisis. Johnny (Evans) can't settle down with a girl, not that he's trying. And Ben (Chiklis) is made of stone, although his girlfriend (Washington) doesn't seem to mind. Now the world is about to be devoured by an evil force heralded by a glistening silver guy on a surf board (Jones, with Fishburne's voice). And they may need to team up with nemesis Victor Von Doom (McMahon) to save the planet.The filmmakers strike a humorous tone early on, combining a colourful comic book design with goofy comedy to get us chuckling. Jokes about invasive paparazzi and corporate sponsorship abound, even as both are the franchise's bread and butter. And the wink-nudge innuendo will keep kids feeling like they're watching something vaguely grown up, even though any TV sitcom takes things far further than this tame movie. Meanwhile, we know the wackiness will soon be interrupted by something nefarious and earth-threatening.And it's pretty impressive. After a slightly awkward plot set-up, things kick into gear, combining thrilling action with genuinely clever gags (the power-swapping is ingenious). It's great to see a full-on London effects sequence, as well as subtle references to, of all things, rendition and human rights issues. Yes, it's still simplistic, with the requisite boneheaded military idiot (Braugher) and some extremely random scenes, but it's also thoroughly cool--especially the foursome's new vehicle and the surfer himself. There's also an intriguingly serious final twist. Ish.Clearly, Stan Lee and Marvel have an obsession with embarrassing disco dancing this year (see also Spider-man 3). But it helps that the cast are having a lot more fun this time. They're engagingly relaxed and allowed to deepen the characters and play around with the iconography. Honestly, this is how the first film should have been, and it bodes well for more to come.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
379,gotendbz-2,A good enjoyable movie. The best of the summer sequels so far!,8,25 June 2007,"I'm a big fan of the comics, and was really looking forward to this, and I was not disappointed like I was with Spider-Man 3. This is a GIGANTIC step up from the first film. It's got everything, Action, Comedy, Drama, Romance, you name it! The acting is pretty good, Chris Evans does a great job as Johnny Storm and Michael Chiklis is perfect as the Thing. And the Silver Surfer, oh man was he awesome. He was the best part of the movie. He was spectacular! The effects were great and his story was great, and they have set it up for a possible solo film. I'm not going to give that many spoilers but, You do NOT see Galactus like he was in the comics (Though sometimes you see what appears to be the shape of his helmet), but I don't really think it was that big of a deal. They did a good job with it. They had some corny lines in this movie but it wasn't too bad. The first half of the movie is a little slow, but it gets better and better, the last half was great.Lets put this simple: This movie was good. It was the perfect summer film. I cannot see how anyone could call this a terrible movie, most that are calling it horrible are just crazed fanboys that are NEVER pleased with anything. I loved it and it was worth the ticket to see it!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
380,boah-2,A weak script stretched out to 90 minutes,3,26 June 2007,"The weak storyline focuses on the relationships between the members of the Fantastic Four more than the ""rise of the Silver Surfer"". Sequences like those of Reed's bachelor party are completely unneeded in the story line, but are need in order to meet the minimum time needed for a feature length film. Jessica Alba, although a beautiful woman, is a horrible actress. I do not blame it all on her though, as the dialogue and situations they put her in make her character a complete jerk: she gets angry at Reed for trying to save the world at the expense of her perfect weeding. Boo hoo Sue, but if you think about it you can't have a perfect wedding if the world is destroyed, that's worse than rain.The biggest disappointment was ""Galactus"" aka the cloud. He's a giant cloud, need I say more? This means he can be defeated with a fan and a hot day. Also the SS who gets his power from Galactus is able to defeat Galatus with said powers. Don't even get me started with the fact that SS gets his powers from the board? Why does Marvel put up with the brutal slaying of all it's characters? All in all this movie was not enough SS and too much of the FF's family life. Weak script, bad action, bad acting, and hokey plot holes.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

If you liked the original, you'll love the sequel.If you want a deep story, fleshed out characters, go watch an art house movie 'cause FF2 is just damn good fun from start to finish. It manages to avoid retreads from the first and gets going from the first frame.The team deliver again especially Johnny Storm, man, that guy cracks me up! Doug Jones/Laurence Fishburne both do a great job on the Silver Surfer, here's hoping he gets his own movie! All that's left to say is that I'm pretty sure that in another couple of years, it'll be clobberin' time again! Flame on!!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
382,legba11,Horrid,3,16 June 2007,"Really bad comic book movie. I didn't think they could get worse than the first FF movie, but somehow they managed to.Even Jessica looked ugly in this...Obvious canned jokes, bad acting (for the most part), cheap CGI effects, you name it, this movie had it.They took the best part of the first, Doom, and replaced him with a cloud of dust. (At least Doom was still cool in this one)Marvel may have started churning these movies out too fast, considering the quality lately...I thought Xmen3 was a step down, but compared to the two sequels this summer, it was incredible.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
383,Masamune41790,Awesome Movie! Better than I thought it would be!,8,23 June 2007,"I walked in this movie thinking ""Meh, this movie will be Okay.."" But Boy was I wrong! This movie was awesome. The CGI effects the story and the acting. Unlike anyone who gave this a bad review, I don't just say, ""The acting was good"" Or ""The acting was Bad"". Let me explain why.All the characters had a strong emotional persona. No character was bland or hard to figure out. Even the surfer.They had funny little jokes here and there to keep the suspense down. And it was actually funny. The CGI was choreographed well and done well.There were a FEW things in the movie that didn't make sense. Like in the beginning, when Mr.Fantastic had a bachelor party. Somehow when the general came to Sue's house, she knew where he was even though it was kept a secret. And at that party Mr.Fantastic was stretching his arms and legs in regular clothing. Even though the only thing that can stretch like him is his uniform. But these are just minor things, just figure I should mention it.All in all this movie was awesome.

384,deron-7,Another Tim Story debacle,3,8 February 2008,"Seriously, how does this man get hired? Twice now he and writers Dan Payne and Mark Frost have taken the dynamic, sci-fi adventure stories of the Fantastic Four and turned them into limp, half-hearted mush. Although this one doesn't have as many bad shots or embarrassingly edited action sequences, none of the action in this film has any real excitement -- everything feels rote, as though the plot mechanics required some blast from Doom or rubbery move from Reed. Imagine how exciting the climax would have been if the Silver and a humanoid Galactus (a la the comic book) duked it out, instead of the atrocious, ""Superman Returns""-style climax Story and crew have handed us! Furthermore, the ""family"" theme is represented by having the Four bicker and then make cute. ""Spiderman"" has demonstrated that comic book movies can have more rounded characters. Only Chris Evans seems well cast and to enjoy his role. I'm sure Avi Arad is satisfied whenever he looks at this bank account but from an artistic and pop-cultural standpoint, the best thing that can be said about the ""Fantastic Four"" movies is that they are soon to be forgotten.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

386,watchlaar,The only connection to the comic; This mess rates in the Negative Zone!!,1,22 October 2007,"I'm pretty critical about most film, but I've never been a snob about genre. I've seen great, visionary work in Action, Sci-Fi, Horror, Comedy, Drama... you name it.I've also been reading the Fantastic Four comics for 30 years. As a kid, I used to dream about my favorite heroes making the leap to the big screen. This type of film is a complete embarrassment to the comic, which (as a medium) has been so maligned over the years as a lowbrow form of entertainment. If the comics are lowbrow, this celluloid atrocity is NO-brow.First, let me comment on the cast: Ben Grimm (The Thing) is supposed to be a mammoth, imposing creature. NOT an ""aww-shucks"" curmudgeon that constantly stares at his feet and apologizes to anyone he brushes against, or even startles from a distance! I felt like I was watching Shemp!! Pathetic. Sue Storm (Invisible Girl) looks like a Volkswagen full of clowns crashed into her face! If you have to put THAT much effort into convincing us that this is a blond-haired, blue-eyed all-American girl-next-door, why bother? They've bastardized the whole thing so badly already; why not just leave Alba as she is? Otherwise, just cast someone who actually FITS the part! It's not like Alba is any great actress. ""Why does this always happen to ME?"" (as opposed to it happening to anyone else) laments the oaken-spoken Invisible girl, after an embarrassing scene wherein she becomes visible just after she loses her clothes? I don't know, Jessica.... Is it because you're the only one who can go from visible to INvisible? If you meant that this SITUATION always happens to you, wouldn't you put the emphasis on ANY OTHER WORD besides ""ME""??? Just awful. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic).... I understand the need to give the stiff-collared, human computer a ""hip"" overhaul for today's young audience... but this schlemiel bears NO resemblance to his comic book namesake. He's about 20 years too young, he's a SHRIMP (Reed should be thin, but tall) and, as an actor, he ranks a notch below Dan Marino! NEXXXTT!!!  Johnny Storm (Human Torch) is probably the only redeeming interpretation of an FF member in the film. He's cocky, impetuous and a superstar w/ the ladies. His performance caused me no pain. No complaints.As far as the story and the dialogue go.... UGH. This is where I draw the line. Over 60% of this dog focuses on just how difficult it is for super-heroes to have a wedding. WHO CARES? That is no basis for a whole STORYLINE. The whole mess amounts to incessant, insipid and puerile dialogue that gets ZERO miles to the gallon. If you're going to put these characters under a microscope this way, write some dialogue that doesn't sound like a passage from Goofus & Gallant! The characters, again, were so off-the-mark that I thought I might begin to throw up, and never stop. Reed Richards, with a little prodding, becomes a high-steppin' chick magnet on the dance floor? I needed a double scotch after that one. Doctor Doom was just a pointless addition, and his character is so far removed from what Doom is all about, they may as well have left his entire screen-time on the cutting-room floor.This is, perhaps, the most witless script I have ever cringed through. Stan Lee's writing was like TOLSTOY compared to this abortion. As big a fan as I am of the FF comics, I held off on seeing EITHER FF movie in the theatre, and after suffering through this wince-a-thon, I know my decision was justified.Lastly, the special effects looked like something that Sid & Marty Krofft cobbled together after smoking some Sigmund. The above-referenced sequence featuring our Mr. Fantastic on the disco floor had the most pathetic ""stretch"" effects you can imagine. The Thing looks like a fat brick-layer from Paterson, NJ. He can't comfortably sit on an airplane seat? The Thing would need an entire two ROWS, people. The Silver Surfer looked OK, but the mercurial terminator from Terminator 2 (SIXTEEN YEARS AGO) looked just as good as this. Regardless, if they had spent 40 of the minutes they wasted on the whole wedding nonsense on the Surfer, the film might have been bearable.Kirby would spin endlessly in his grave, we he aware of how corrupted his creations have become.Quite possibly the WORST comic-book adaptation ever made.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
387,greendayot20,Very good movie!,9,18 June 2007,"I think this movie was very good despite the whole galactus cloud thing. The action was throughout the movie, there wasn't much talking about problems, it was just awesome. The only flaw was that the fantastic four never actually fought doom(except torch) or the silver surfer which was a little boring. I think that the whole galactus cloud thing was OK because I mean that would be gay if a giant purple man was floating towards earth and was trying to destroy it using his powers or whatever. That doesn't seem too threatening or scary. The cloud thing made it seem like the world was falling apart and surely going to be destroyed.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
388,hitchikingalaxy,How the F#@K could they make Galactus a cloud???,9,18 June 2007,"I really liked how the movie maintained the flavor of the comic book, but I don't understand how they could ever think that a gigantic space cloud would be cooler than Galactus.The inter-personal conflicts of the characters struggling to maintain their own identities within the confines of being super heroes drives the narrative. The concept of a villain that is driven to worship a massive deity of destruction is an interesting choice.There were a lot of things about this movie that worked, and very little that didn't, though an amount of suspended belief is possible. It is a bit implausible that Sue would be able to have a conversation with Norrin Radd (The Silver Surfer) in the middle of a detention center, but that kind of thing happened in the comic books all of the time. It was also refreshing seeing the character defending the values of capitalism being characterized as selfish, and having to learn to work as a team.The film was definitely worth seeing, and though some chemistry was present between Sue, it was definitely portrayed in a way that would not affect children.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
389,moviemaster200300,"A fun, action-packed comic book movie!",5,18 June 2007,"I'll start off by saying that the reason I enjoyed this movie was because, it was fun! Don't get me wrong, I love all the serious comic adaptations like Batman and The Punisher... but it was great to watch a super hero movie that was light, funny, and still had plenty of action/special effects sequences. The acting was so-so. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba aren't the greatest when it comes to acting, but they get the job done (although they deliver many lines that had me rolling my eyes). On the other hand, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans were perfect for their parts, and I enjoyed every moment that either of them were on the screen (they not only act as comic relief, but they're also the best when it comes to kicking the crap out of the bad guy). So, to wrap it up, the movie had great action sequences, some cute funny parts, and a simple storyline that should keep any movie fan entertained. If you're looking for a serious/intense movie, this isn't for you.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
390,petersmithe55,"Better than the first, but that's it...",4,21 June 2007,"Saw the film this afternoon. While it is a huge improvement on the first Fantastic Four film (how could it have been any worse??), it still lacked a good story, acting, pacing and everything else that a good superhero movie needs. I realise that the director is aiming the film at a mainly young audience, but does everything have to be so simplistic? The dialogue, in particular, is really cringe inducing much of the time and actors don't do anything to help matters. Jessica Alba in particular, is very weak. And a little less makeup next time wouldn't hurt!! The one good thing was the Silver Surfer, who did look and sound pretty cool. Dr Doom was again hopelessly underwritten and was just there as a plot device. So on the whole, a real disappointment.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
391,rajiv-v,Fantastic Four 2: Anything but Fantastic,5,26 June 2007,"They say sequels seldom pack the punch of the original, with only a few exceptions viz sequel to The Godfather, Lord of the Rings and as a matter of fact Die Hard with a Vengeance was probably better than the prequels. But with the Fantastic Four, it just wasn't to be. The first movie was itself a bit of a disappointment. The second has deteriorated one more notch.I have always preferred other Marvel superheroes to the Fantastic Four. As a team they never really proved their mettle before the likes of Batman, Superman, Captain America etc.The movie was anything but extraordinary. The character, Mr. Fantastic, is certainly a scientist nerd, but the character would have been better with a stronger personality assuming the role  perhaps, Billy Zane if he loses his English accent even George Clooney with his powerful personality and shades of white hair. Sue Storm aka Jessica Alba certainly does not fit the role well either. Her moves are not as crisp and powerful for a superwoman, as compared with an Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider or Jennifer Garner or even Charlize Theron in Eon Flux. Every instance that Jessica Alba triggered her force field, it almost seemed like she was only posing for a photograph. Her posture and the manner in which she carried herself was certainly not superhero-like. 'The Thing' and 'The Human Torch' are perhaps the only ones doing justice to their roles. The Silver Surfer speaks little and zips across the planet, but the portrayal was apt. He at least seemed to carry the sense of terror and might about him through his actions.Movies with superheroes are expected to be powerful, but it hardly shows with the Fantastic group. Take Batman Begins for instance. Although the movie did have several sober and emotional scenes, the build-up to the story was well done. The manner in which lose ends came together and smooth switching between past-present-and-future are credits to good direction in the movie. Fantastic Four did not have any of those. The story seemed like a mundane series of events where good foresees a threat, accepts help from evil and is double crossed but eventually prevails  in that very order. There were few instances of humor, thanks to The Human Torch and The Thing, else the movie would have been just that much worse.Among movies that have been adopted from comic books, Sin City, although one without super heroes, was powerful. It carried emotions and strength from pictures in the comic to the movie.Fantastic Four was everything but fantastic.I would rate it 5/10.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
392,shoegolf42,The Silver Surfer is done an injustice,4,7 July 2008,"OK, I am a big fan of the Silver Surfer comics, I think they are better than any other Marvel comics out there. I didn't have terribly high expectations for the movie itself but wanted to see it for the Surfer's character. I was sadly disappointed that nothing in the comic books was followed up by the movie.This, on the other hand is a great kids' movie. If I was say seven years old again I would LOVE this movie. But, it is indeed very stupid. I mean like when The Human torch is like stretchy at the end and he is flying and on fire at the same time and says ""It's Clobbering time"" was just stupid.So, overall if you are older than 7 years old only watch this if you're watching with your kid or baby-sitting or something.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

It felt like it didn't know what it wanted to deliver, a big array of displaced jokes, uninteresting narratives and not much of a payoff.This second installment is better in the way it portrays its characters. We get a little depth and not too many unnecessary character 'side story lines'. The movie also tickled my funny bones in the right ways. Most of the times at least.The biggest problem with this movie is that the ending feels rushed. We have this big buildup that erupts into a quick fix ending. The character of the Silver Surfer deserved more attention to its complex details.Enjoyable although forgettable.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
394,sterydus,"Entertaining, some plot changing decisions harm it though.",6,23 June 2007,"Good but nothing special, Spiderman was better than this but that doesn't mean this was bad. Whenever you might think this comic movie is bad think about ghost rider and you'll realize this movie is actually awesome in comparison.Acting was OK but nothing special or memorable. People keep bashing Alba and McMahon, but they aren't that bad, I've seen worse from supposedly great actors, i won't name names because thats a matter of opinion i suppose.Doom's involvement in the plot was badly done but his final battle was a treat and made me sort of forgive his absurd presence alongside the F4.Special effects were good in some places like the silver surfer himself but were bad in other like on reed's stretchy powers. However overall they worked.Surfer's powers coming from his board were a change but it doesn't harm the original plot too much. Galactus being a persona-less cloud that simply does not live up to his great comic character was a MAJOR bad move. They destroyed an awesome character and morality issue when dismissing his motivations for eating planets by changing him into a pathetic cloud.Sound and music felt like it was just thrown in and seemed generic and not very effective. Suspense and atmosphere suffered in parts because of this such as Sue's encounter with the surfer in the woods.Cinematography and shots seemed style-less until the latter half of the film such as surfer's supposed self sacrifice and the doom battle sequence, only then did i see the comic book style visuals, that made me raise eyebrows and think 'that was a nice angle' (such as when Ben flies past doom in his ship and gives him quite possibly the biggest punch ever).Overall it delivered a lot with what it was but could have been a bit braver and given Galactus a character and cut out a lot of doom's presence. they could have made him a more shadowy, plotting-in-the background kind of character rather than working with the F4 a lot of the time. You can hear the echoes of the Hollywood suits whenever he is on screen, listen carefully... ""you can't make Julian McMahon an ugly Dr. Doom, make him sexy so girls who fancy him will buy tickets to the movie, to hell with Dr. Doom i don't care if thats supposed to be his character, make him Dr. Christian Troy, the fantastic four plot be damned."" If they had been more true to the already strong characters of the comics, and been braver with the soundtrack and dialogue this could have easily toppled Spidey. However as it stands its still watchable and entertaining with competent comedy and action. A good film that built up your hopes for an epic end climax, but cops out and says ""make him a cloud, surfer wastes him and 'that'll do'.""",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
395,niteshmoundekar,Fantastic !,10,16 June 2007,"About the movie, Silver Surfer Roxxx. Most of the screen space is shared between Human Torch and Silver Surfer. It is a great improvement over previous Fantastic Four. First part of the movie is filled with lots of humour most of it comes from Human Torch and The Thing. Then there is romantic wedding. Silver Surfer, the strongest comic hero, doesn't disappoint. The starting sequence where Silver Surfer enters Earth is astonishing. You will shiver while watching that scene. Its awesome. Script writer was well aware of the fact that no one can match him and thus plays it cautiously by not allowing any body to fight respectfully against him. No one stands in its way not even the GalactusHuman Torch gets new power from Silver Surfer. He uses it quite amusingly.Dr. Doom shouldn't have come in this movie. He gets kicked by Human Torch and Silver Surfer so badly.And yes there is beautiful and gorgeous Jessica Alba plays her part fine.What to look for: 1. Silver Surfer entering Earth 2.

396,generac,What a stinker,1,7 October 2007,"For some reason, I completely hate this one. It had a terrible story, and everything was way too cheesy, in a very bad way. Nothing at all was memorable from this film.The effects ranged from decent to stuff worse than a Power Rangers episode. The whole movie had a crappy TV show feel to it. I seriously felt like I was watching Power Rangers at times.The worse part of all, Jessica Alba's makeup was terrible, and inconsistent. It changed throughout the day. She looked plastic. Why destroy a natural beauty like her. And her ""nude"" scene was terrible too. They showed more skin with her wearing the wedding dress.Just unbelievably awful. I rarely hate movies as much as this.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
397,jedifred,The greatest comic book hero of all time finally gets to the big screen - in a BIG way,8,15 June 2007,"The second installment of the Fantastic Four series finds the Four at odds with each other - dealing with celebrity status is not as easy as it may seem - and dealing with both an old threat (Dr. Doom) and two fresh ones - The world-devouring Galactus and his Herald, Norrin Radd - The Silver SurferFans of the Silver Surfer, which was introduced by Marvel in the early 1960's, will find his big-screen look to be extremely well done. For many, the Silver Surfer is the top-dog in the comic book universe - Marvel or otherwise - and his big-screen debut has been anxiously anticipated by fans the world over. The CGI work is perfectly executed by Weta (Lord of the Rings, King Kong) and his character is true to the comic.There are, however, aspects which are not true to the comic - I will not name them here; the detail required to explain would constitute a spoiler - and so as it is with most comic book films, it will be up to the individual reader/viewer to decide how all that matters to them.The film picks up right where FF #1 left off which is good; only a short amount of time has passed. The thing that make the Fantastic Four unique is that they are out in the open - no secret identities. That makes them targets by the supervillan criminal element as well as devoted fans and paparazzi. It's refreshing, but they may have gone a bit overboard here. Still, it had to be explored because these are not aliens but humans with superpowers and ultimately, they must live their lives the same as the rest of us. Hopefully in the next film, they can concentrate on the superhero aspects only.This film was way too short. They could have added another 30 minutes or more quite easily. If there is one basic negative it is that so much more could have been done and that several scenes were rushed.The story is solid, the effects are excellent, the characters are people we care about. And the Surfer is perfect. Kudos to the producers for tapping Laurence Fishburne for the voice. Absolutely Perfect.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
398,freedomfan9,Great film for the Fantastic Four film fan...,9,16 June 2007,"While not being a reader of the Fantastic Four comic books, I highly enjoyed ""Fantastic Four"" (2005) and have since read a few of the books starring our four superheroes. I anticipated this sequel with bated breath and was, if possible, more excited when I saw the first preview for it at the cinema.The Four are back again with gusto, new villains, (a new hero too), special effects galore, more action, and of course: upgraded uniforms. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) are set to marry in the media event of the city, with Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) standing by. But another event is taking place, one more significant...the Silver Surfer, working for Galactus, the destroyer of planets, have set their sights on Earth. The Four's nemesis, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) also returns. Through the film, the team of Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, The Thing and Torch, try to stop the Surfer, while Von Doom appeals to the military, offering his services. Naturally we all know that doesn't end well.The special effects are incredible, and viewers won't be disappointed with more action. The fast-paced ending is brilliant, and at one point shockingly surprising (for me at least!), and everything in between is amazing. Gruffudd and Alba have convincing chemistry as the affianced couple, and the banter between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm is excellently played by Chiklis and Evans. Evans especially gives to his character, transforming from hothead egotistical teenager to more mature, team-oriented adult. All give their characters life...one might say they were meant to play these roles. Each embraces the hardships and ""non-normalish"" bits of their characters extremely well. McMahon as the notorious Victor Von Doom is particularly enjoyable to watch, as he absolutely dominates his scenes with his intensity and brilliance. Not to be outdone, Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne as the body and voice of the Silver Surfer respectively create a character that fans attach to. And Stan Lee fans, it's not hard to miss the Fantastic Four creator at all...as he plays himself! The chemistry of all four lead actors with each other is phenomenal, and they really get through the feeling of family, with the bickering and the love (a touching shot in the conclusion between Johnny and Sue is particularly heartwarming). Their chemistry with their costars is also extremely good. And, thankfully, there were no cheesy lines (remembering Susan Storm's ""These are my lips"" line at the conclusion of the first film).After being sorely disappointed by all the sequels I've seen this summer, which include Spiderman 3, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, and Shrek the Third, I wasn't having too high of hopes for this one, even though I enjoy the Fantastic Four stories more than Spidey, but at last I saw a movie that was worth the ticket, and the time. Instead of 3 hours or just short of, filled with overly-twisting plots, unbearably bad lines, and poor carrying of the plot, ""Fantastic Four"" is an hour and a half of a strong plot, good lines, and tons of effects to keep one riveted, I enjoyed this film immensely and finally was given the film worth my money this summer...in fact it gave me a film worth twice my money...as I saw it again today!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
399,blac9958,This film is so bad.,1,27 December 2007,"Where do I even begin? I read comic books as a child in my younger adult years. The Fantastic Four was one of my favorites. I stopped reading due to 2 reasons. #1. The price of comic books #2. The quality of writing. Before you say that I am just a comic book geek, I am not that. I have a job, relationship and live in the real world.I can remember every story, character and cover of all the FF books that I read over a span of 25 years. I gave this film the benefit of the doubt, as the Silver Surfer stories were some of the best written. The first FF film was really bad. Lame story, lame casting and one of the worst portrayal of a villain I have ever seen in any media. But hey, the Silver Surfer and Galactus were going to be in this sequel, can't go wrong with the world devourer. Boy, was I wrong.The Surfer looked like Ultraman from the old 1967 series from Japan. Galactus looked like an inferior ""V'ger"" from the first Star Trek movie. So, the Surfer simply changes his mind and does a kamikaze into the heart of ""Galactus""? How can a being or any entity give enough power, to someone that serves it, to destroy the entity it serves????? It makes no sense whatsoever. Horrible writing.Now, let's get to the acting. Two words, Jessica Alba. Who the hell cast her originally in these movies? Sure, she's a piece of ass but she couldn't act her way out of a dog food commercial. Bad casting and even worse acting. Was it me or was I the only one that thought her lips were going to explode at any moment? She could die of chapped lips.None of these characters transfers into ""real life"" ala ""Spider-Man"", ""Batman"" or Superman. It simply does NOT work. This is nothing but yet another BABYSITTER movie. Something the little kids would like and the preteens can go see because it is ANOTHER PG-13 movie that their parents can dump them off at for a few hours.That is what 95% of movies are made for nowadays. Baby sitting. That is why the pressure to get your film in at PG-13, so the kiddies can go see it at the mall.Thank God for the Cohen Brothers and other filmmakers who have the balls to make films like ""No Country for Old Men"". Spend your $9.75 to support films like that instead of sewage like this waste of 92 minutes of my life. I can never get that back.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
400,patomas,Is it possible to make it worst?,2,17 July 2007,"Well, this is the kind of film that you go to the movies just because you do not have any thing better to do or because is an action movie and you can enjoy of your pop corn and drinks.The story is too simple, even with such interesting characters and they waste a lot of time in matters absolutely no important for the story itself.Stan Lee is just a mercenary the same as Marvel itself, only interested in making money, with no respect at all for their characters or the public. If they want to make a movie with some superheroes, is OK, every one will go to the movies, but just do no kill well known characters in that way (figuratively speaking).I will really like to ad more comments so you can evaluate with it, but i do not want to spoil the movie, but just as advice, do not waste your money in the movies, rent it with 20 friends so it is worth the money you pay for it.Bye",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
401,jonojet,Entertaining sci-fantasy action for a wide-ranging audience,7,27 June 2007,"After watching lots of action hero movies, you almost always expect the nice guys to win in the end. Almost. It's the twists that make a suspenseful, entertaining action hero movie. For those of you who don't know the plot, you are in for quite a few, believable surprises, which will leave you guessing as to who the goodies are, who the baddies are, and whether the goodies will win in the end!Sure, there were lots of lines which probably sounded lame in comparison with subtle drama, and the performances won't be winning any Oscars. However, this is a film which is enjoyable the adults as well as the kids, on the SAME LEVEL,which is quite difficult to do. That means that adults are not laughing at in-house jokes that the children don't get - everyone is invited into believe the action. Remember, this is the first action hero movie to receive a PG rating for a while, which is a nice change from the increasingly violent movies we are subjecting kids to these days. The movie also has a moral bent; of cooperation, reconciling differences, and not judging others too quickly.On the special effects side, I would say that they were, indeed, very well done, with one exception: that is, I felt that Mr. Fantastic's powers were not done justice by the special effects team, in comparison to some beautiful effects which we see in the other characters. The dance scene was particularly disappointing.An entertaining film that everyone will enjoy, together.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
402,richard-865,What All Comic Book SuperHero Movies Should Be...,8,17 June 2007,"I'm sure the critics and naysayers of this film will take exception to my review, but I loved this! As a longtime fan of the Fantastic Four comic, I went into the first movie with fairly low expectations, and was very pleasantly surprised to the contrary. Not a great superhero movie, but a really fun one, a trait that far too many films based on comic books seem to be lacking. Having enjoyed the FF the first time around, I went into this second one with much higher expectations - and it exceeded them on almost every level! The same feeling of fun was there, along with some real blow-you-out-of-your-seat action sequences, and what I thought was a pretty good storyline. Perhaps I'm too undemanding or simple-minded, but I had a Fantastic(!) time in the theater watching this movie. In many ways, it blew me away like no movie has in a good many years, and made me feel like a kid again! Of course it helped that along with the FF, the Silver Surfer has always been one of my favorite comic characters. If I have one complaint, it's that it ended too soon. I hated for it to be over after only 92 minutes. Hopefully when the DVD is released they'll include a longer extended version as well (or as in the case with the first movie, they'll wait two years until the third one comes out, and make us buy the second movie on DVD all over again). I really hate that sort of marketing ploy, but in the case of FF2, it will gladly shell out my money twice. Mostly because I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I think I'll start working on my new home theater system tomorrow!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

At the time that these people wrote reviews I suppose they hadn't see the Green Latern or either of the Ghost Riders. They should've kept going in this series. Or at least they should've kept going with the silver surfer. Excellent! The first one was great also.I don't get the logistics of the new one coming out.There are some obvious deviations from the comics to the point which someone might say, ""I don't think the four are fantastic, we should just call them The Four or the Socially Acceptable Quad or the Politically Correct group.""Michelle Rodriguez makes a valid point.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Like the first movie, there was horrible character development. Poor direction led to really corny camera shots as well. Why do they keep making these movies? This was absolutely terrible. I hope that they do not end up making a 3rd movie as it was hinted, because it will turn out even crappier than the 1st and the 2nd. This wasn't Fantastic 4, it was more like Horrendous 4. It was the most painful hour and thirty minutes of my life. If you just want to watch a movie for effects, then you will enjoy the movie. You might also be mentally retarded, but that's OK.

405,jeffdepressio,Relatively Speaking,7,22 June 2007,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is not a good movie. It is, however, a good comic book movie. When you compare this film to many of Marvel's other recent cinematic outings, it can be appreciated much more.What makes Fantastic Four a success is that it avoids the pitfalls of other comic book films. It doesn't take itself too seriously (see ""Hulk""), nor does it lose track of the significance of its source material (see ""Spider-Man 3""). The movie is schlocky but not offensive; it is artificial without feeling completely manufactured. Despite the rampant and obvious product placement, the filmmakers avoid attaching the unnecessary social or political commentary that often weights down comic book films. The focus here is on the team's powers which give way to some decent and entertaining action sequences. The acting is mostly unremarkable, though Michael Chiklis once again steals the show as Ben Grimm.Fantastic Four is nothing remarkable, but if you enjoy tacky summer movie fare, it doesn't come much better than this.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Some people hate this movie, but in my honest opinion, I liked it. I consider this the best Fantastic Four movie I have ever seen. This sequel is as cool as the 2005 predecessor, and way better than the reboot. The plot may have some problems but the writing for the movie is pretty decent.

I don't know about you, but I go to see them for the visually stunning action sequences and the nostalgia to see awesome characters of childhood cartoons, books and games. This movie delivered the later...ONLY. I can honestly say the only reason I gave it a 2 was because I saw the characters and their powers (kinda).To give you a summary of this horrible movie: it started, their were jokes, use of powers to make the jokes funny, more jokes, about 15 minutes of total action, more jokes, poor representation of galactus and sappy ending with more jokes.Silver Surfer, one of my favorite characters, was well represented. He was the only thing that made me not walk out of the movie. The jokes were the cheesiest I have ever seen. Even more so than Maguire's ""goth"" in spider-man 3. The redeeming quality in that movie was the action sequences. You don't get that in FF2. Just pseudo seriousness and cheap jokes by using and/or abusing their powers.

Even thought it had its strong points, the movie lacked a steady sense of direction. First you're thinking that Silver Surfer is the bad guy, and then Dr. Doom returns and tries to steal the show. I would've preferred to have had him as a little cameo appearance but once again, he was the one against the FF in the ''kinda'' climatic final battle scene.I got bored halfway through to be honest. The whole wedding debacle crap and the corny ending with their wedding with a bunch of little Chinese kids in some foreign country (China maybe?).I had hoped it would be better. I think I was still a little put off by Alba's wig, and that bull crap in the club with Mr. Fantastic.

410,matthew-ervin,"Pretty Good, but could be better",7,16 June 2007,"I like it . . . but that doesn't mean there aren't things that they could do better. First off, Galactus was a little lame. Also, Dr. Doom just comes out of nowhere. Sure, he's been brought back accidentally by the surfer, but nobody just comes right out to you, even if you are a galactic herald,and says, ""hey, let's rule the world together!"" Also, some of the character personalities have been changed like Sue. She's now shallow. however, the movie was good fun--it had some killer action scenes and a passable plot. It's a little over the top - but hey! - this is comic book world, people! Anything can happen! It was also relatively funny. Some jokes fall flat but they're all at least mildly funny. The silver surfer is really cool--he's well developed. All in all, I'd say the movie was decent. Not mind-blowing, but fun worthy to spend some time on.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Wow, what didn't they get wrong with this??? The worst part about the whole mess is that The Fantastic Four should have been done with so much more respect and care (re: X-Men, Spider-Man, Superman 1,2, and Returns, Batman Begins...) as opposed to some flavor of the month action movie with a few cool looking sets, and that goes for the first FF movie as well. Where to start with how bad this is...The Thing is a cheesy rubber suit (didn't anyone learn anything from Roger Corman?).The Thing is a cheesy rubber suit. (deserves to be stated twice) -The characterizations of the individual members of The Fantastic Four are overbearing and for the most part wrong.The story and acting suck - Jessica Alba is just plain wrong for Sue Storm.Dr. Doom is a petty, one-liner dropping villain instead of a badass.Having to hold back the vomit crawling up my throat every time The Thing or Johnny have anything to say to each other...or anyone else for that matter.The special effects mostly suck, and they REALLY suck at the club when Reed is dancing.Going ""Ultimate"" with the story instead of culling better ideas from a 40 year pedigree.Worst Stan Lee cameo in any Marvel movie to date.Galacticloud I could take a long time and point out more but that's about all I care to recall about this movie since I've already wasted enough of my precious life watching it once and I'll never watch it again.

Secondly it has a very good storyline and is easy to understand compared to the earlier films such as spiderman 3 and POC3 and that makes the movie A lot more enjoyable What really worked out is the acting of the characters in the movie and the dialog which made the story even more interesting which makes you want to know what happens nextGalactus fans need not be disappointed . You actually do see galactus inside the clouds when surfer enters into the heart of the storm. What you see is a fireball resembling the helmet of galactus right in front of the surfer if you observe carefully and when the camera does back away and shows a view of the earth and the cloud. You will see a glowing body which is what you think it is, Galactus. Many people fail to notice this because those scenes are very very short and what backs this up is you do see his shadow looming over saturn and that shadow represents his helmet. In my personal opinion they did this to make galactus a mystery because revealing him completely will destroy the mystery factor and thus it wouldn't be thrilling to see galactus at all.How ever what disappointed me is that dr doom does not have much screen time but however his return only made the film more epic and spectacular",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

The Fantastic 4 are a wonderful group of heroes, fun and interesting. Their enemies are some of the better villains in the comic book world. Yet even with this wealth of characters and ideas, this movie turned out like garbage. Why? Because the people responsible DON'T CARE about the comics or the fans.

You're never once actually drawn to these character, there's no shades of grey just black and white along with mindless dialog that never seems to add up.Special Effects..

It had the potential to be the best comic movie so far, they had Doom, the Surfer, and Galactus. they had some of the coolest and yet most feared characters in comics and yet the somehow managed to screw it up in the worst way possible. Doom was the biggest waste of talent I've seen in a comic movie, the guy had no point being in it. He was nothing but a plot device that got his ass kicked during the entire movie, a grand total of three times to exact.And for a movie that's called the Rise of the Silver Surfer we sure didn't see much rising from him. The way the introduced the Surfer was pretty good, but other then that he was more of a hassle for the FF team. Because his power is tied to his board, which is Extremely stupid! What the hell were these guys on when they were writing the story. There's a part in the movie were he was actually tied down and tortured! STUPID! Why didn't they just stick with the Surfer from the comic. Galactus was completely ruined in this film, he was killed by his servant the Silver Surfer..

I also think that the movie could've been longer seeing as it was only about an hour and a half. After leaving this movie i wasn't really disappointed because the first one sucked so i wasn't expecting much. The movie could have had a lot more action because there was barely any at all except for the last fight with doctor doom. Overall it really wasn't that great.

We soon find out that this cosmic energy is in fact an alien on a surfboard zooming down to Earth to prepare it for destruction. These two story lines are the principle actions guiding the story. There are two other subplots. One is in regards to Dr. Doom being 'resurrected,' while the other involves Johnny Storm's selfish nature endangering his family.Four plots that should make an epic film span a terribly short running time of 1 hour and 30 minutes. Did it work? Did they abandon the goofy nature of the first film and reinvigorate the franchise with an epic story about the fate of the entire planet. No on both counts. The humor is entirely aimed at children (which goes along with its PG rating.) 'Thing' is played for laughs without any degree of intensity. Johnny Storm's crisis of conscience robs all of the charisma established in the first (even if it wasn't much.) Sue Storm is more of a nag than an asset to the team. In addition, there is nothing to signify Reed Richards as the leader to a powerful team of superheroes. He comes off as a self-esteem deprived, blow hard jackass. There isn't one iota of chemistry between any of the characters. The wretched family dynamics are trumped only by Dr. Doom, who can only be described as the worst villain to ever grace the screen. Julian McMahon's portrayal of Victor Von Doom seems barely suited for a Sci-Fi cable channel movie, let alone a mega-budget studio film (not that they always choose the best talent, but come on!).For a story such as this, the amount of claustrophobia throughout, borders on pure agony. It lacks anything even resembling 'scope of vision.' The only audience 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' is suited for is children between the ages of 5 & 10. Anyone over that age looking for an entertaining piece of escapism will run into a wall of condescension.Now, let's look at it with comic-book eyes. As most may know, The Silver Surfer works for a planet-devouring villain, Galactus. The Surfer scouts out planets, using his board as a cosmic beacon for Galactus to follow. There is no definition, no rules; they just make them up as they go along. There is no Watcher, so we are told about Galactus through an unbearably cheesy heart-to-heart with Sue and The Surfer. There isn't a shred of genuine impending doom because they never establish what Galactus really is (in the press kit, under character description, it should just read-big damn tornado).The director Tim Story and his band of screenwriters have once again broken the hearts of FF fans all over. They have no respect. They have no understanding on what makes the 'Fantastic Four' story work, or any story for that matter. I gave Tim Story a break the first time around, but not this time. He should'V looked back at the first one, compared it to the comic book films that work and just said, ""Damn! I gotta sit this one out before I do it all over again!"" However, he didn't do that. He looked at the numbers from the first one and assumed that money always equals success. Now as for the screenwriters; give them a Cartoon Network show and let them have at it. If they have any talent, it could be realized there.However, FF2 wasn't a total failure. The Surfer is phenomenal (with the exception being Lawrence Fishburne's distracting voice). His entire body seemed to be in constant motion. I was mesmerized for every moment he was on screen. The special effects team did an outstanding job. However, what is perplexing about the look of the Surfer is what it did to the other special effects. Reed's ability to stretch looked even more unnatural than in the first. Sue's shield, Johnny's fire, everything else was sidelined. It was as if the team only concentrated on The Surfer.I have been teetering on the edge of spoiling the end. I won't, but damn I want to. Any self-respecting Silver Surfer fan would scream! It is horrible. It makes no sense and it will enrage fans even more than Alba being cast as Sue Storm. I will only say this-Hollywood Cop Out.No doubt, this movie will make money. I was shocked by the public's positive reaction to the first film. Audiences will be so dazzled by the effects that they will forget that they are watching a terrible movie.I knew in my heart it would happen, but I had hoped our optimistic nature would pay off. I was wrong. I won't make that mistake again, no matter what the 'Fantastic Four' future may hold.'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' is a disrespectful, sleight of hand circus show devoid of any elements that make a movie a movie.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
423,simon-welsh,Have we lost the concept of Super Heros?,4,22 July 2007,"OK So I was never a huge comic fan but I'm still stunned that 'Marvel' was OK allowing its name to be branded across the very first screen ... followed by what I can only describe as unmitigated ignorance.If a person is really blessed with superpowers, and could do really amazing things like become a human fire ball (Johnny), strutting around in a towel (between gym sessions) doing the sexy, steam-dry, 'look-at-me-I'm-so-hot' trick for a female army officer is hardly the way to spend ones time when the fate of the world rests on your shoulders...(he was really really hot in that scene BTW but it's not the point!)And, if you have the misfortune to end up naked on the sidewalk outside your apartment block (Sue)... it was only for a few seconds, and it's not as if the media got a full frontal shot of her boobs, would you really sit up stairs in your big old glass fronted princess chamber, channel surfing to see how many stations were talking about YOU and your recent naked accident, and then howl at your fiancée about how awful it is to be in the limelight all the time and how it's impossible to get away from all the attention... it was a real 'shout at the screen' moment for me. Was I watching a movie or was I watching Big Brother meets American Dream on Sunset Beach... painful.And lastly when Reed answers back to the army guy with a series of one liners that was supposed to be a slam-down, I thought he belittled himself and his fiancée by objectifying her with statements like... 'yeah, and I walked away with the hottest chick in school while you were still the Quarterback.' like he's commending her for her blond hair and white teeth... and her response to this... NO JOKE... was... I'm so hot for you right now!"" I think the director must have forced the script write into this, maybe his grandkids told him it would sound really hip, about 10 years ago.To sum up... the movie has great special effects, lots of eye candy for boys and girls, cheap gags, no moral value system or character depth and I actually found it a bit of a time and brain theft. Put it this way... although they are superheroes, they should and probably will, all win the Darwin Awards at some stage.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

This sequel is a lot better than the first one and I think this movie deserves a better rating because Fantastic Four is a family superheroes, it's not spider-man or batman. I truly enjoy every moment in this film. Every character is developing, I just love what the film maker did with it.Dr. Doom is more bad-ass and silver surfer is really cool, even more cool when he lost his power(became a make up effect rather than CG).

Every character is good in the movie and well balance so if you are looking for more characters personality the movie also delivers.Talking about special effects are great better than the first one and will catch you eye for sure.I think the movie delivers and anybody can enjoy it.And for those hard core fans better two movies of the F4 than nothing so accepted as it is because is great and is much better than reading paper so enjoy!!The movie is very good.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

It's not really that bad, but it's nowhere close as good to Spiderman 2, Batman Begins, or even Superman Returns. Like what happened to the Dark Phoenix arc in X-Men 3, the writers of FF series wasted another great mythology to the comic books. At least the Silver Surfer fx looked good. Oh well. After the mediocre 1st Fantastic Four movie, you would think that they would have listened to all the criticisms and made improvements on this sequel. Instead they went the other way, doing exactly the opposite of what the fans wanted. I don't even consider myself a comic book dork, but I'm getting malcontent with the dilution of quality in these comic book adaption after a strong run of some great movies in the last couple of year. I hope this movie tanks, so we won't get another. Unfortunately, I've highly doubt it. This movie will have an big opening. Enough to warrant another sequel.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

And when you put him in the movie, make him cool, instead of being a crybaby about his woman back on planet Krypton.Secondly, wow. Dr Doom's ""vital information"" and reason for being in this movie is to tell the F4 that ""the surfboard is important to the surfer"". Certainly this valuable information is a concrete reason to allow a super-villain to join your team.Thirdly, if Galactus is so tough, why does it take one guy on a surfboard to blow him up? No explanation about what Galactus is or what he does. Apparently he is just a dust cloud that can be destroyed if you fly up his butt and get real angry-like.Fourthly, the F4 ride a flying Dodge.

428,dejan-30,Same tack as Spiderman but better,7,16 June 2007,"Ten years ago moves based on comic books were created for kids and adults considered them idiotic. The heroes were idealistic cretins and the villains were one-dimensional idiots like Schwarzenegger in Batman & Robin.Fortunately, Hollywood has finally understood that their audience has grown up and have started making comic book movies that adults can enjoy. The pinnacle of that sudden IQ infusion was Batman Begins with Christian Bale.Silver Surfer is nowhere close to that but still provides an enjoyable superhero movie. It still suffers from tacky ""lets talk about our feelings"" moments, but thankfully it keeps them to a minimum and instead provides a lot of humor and action.If you enjoy comic book movies you should enjoy this one. It's not the best in its genre but it's still good entertainment.Dejan",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
429,silver_surfer-4,Not bad - but too aimed at teen and female audiences,6,18 June 2007,"For those who have actually read them, as opposed to just seen the movies, just how many Marvel superhero comics feature weddings? We have had 2 now in this movie and Spiderman 2. Yes, there has to be a ""love interest"" in most if not all of the superhero lives, but to allow it to dominate a super hero movie is a mistake, it's to make it into a part-time chick flick or soap opera. The other element in this feminisation of the superhero concept is the repeated miscasting of Jessica Alba, who comes across as pretty much a dumb blonde type, and would do a lot better in my view if she STAYED invisible throughout the entire movie.She has a nice shape, but that's about it, and when she talks about being ""hot"" for Reed when he stands up to the army general, and says she had a wild bachelorette party to outdo Reed's mostly unwanted and really pathetically tame bachelor party, it comes across too much as a ""girl power"" exercise, which really is not what male superhero comic fans want to see, because if they did, they'd go to a Spice Girls concert instead.(Jessica Alba also claimed in an interview she was the most powerful of the FF characters, which isn't really proved in the movies or the comics to the best of my awareness, especially when in the first movie it was claimed Johnnie could ""go supernova"", and it was mainly his superpower that stopped Von Doom)But of course, we'd be mistaken if we thought this movie was being made for the original 60s and 70s comic book superhero fans, because they are mostly in their 40s, 50s or beyond, and they are not the 7 - 30 year old demographic that is presumably the target audience for the movie and DVD purchases. So instead of getting a proper woman to play the Invisible Girl who would appeal to the older genuine comic audience - e.g. Michelle Pfeiffer, Elizabeth Hurley or Rachel Weisz with a blond wig, or whoever - they ironically have cast a young girl like Jessica Alba - who mostly only appeals to teenagers because she has got so little depth and maturity - as the Invisible Woman, once again taking an unneeded liberty changing her title inappropriately from the Invisible Girl.And it's very sad, because all the male characters are well cast, and the Thing in particular is a great effort, given the fact he is real and not CGId except in some of the more difficult action scenes no doubt. The Silver Surfer is visually stunning, but again, he is made a romantic figure with a love interest, not only in his own alien relationship, but also with Jessica Alba's dull and tedious portrayal of Sue Storm.The humour also seemed to be poorer in this second effort, too formulaic, whereas it was quite fresh in the first movie, like the scene on the bridge where a bird dumps on the Thing and he talks the guy out of jumping only for the cops to turn the guns on him, and the combative interplay scenes with Johnny Storm.The first movie was far better, though probably suffered a little from under-budget, because it needed more protracted action scenes, like in the Spiderman 2 movie, in which there are probably from memory about 4 or 5 separate confrontations between Spidey and Doc Ock including the fantastic train sequence.Nevertheless, because the FF characters are fundamentally so good, I hope they make a third movie with the following changes:a) replace Jessica Alba with a much better and more intelligent and womanly actress e.g. Jeri Ryan from Star Trek Voyager b) get a genuine comedy script writer to write in scenes between Johnnie Storm and the Thing, you know, the kind of guy who writes for the Simpsons, Futurama or whoever c)make the movie 2hrs, space it out more, allowing more complex plot line and character development and not make it such a non-stop action roller coaster, which appeals only to dysfunctional zap game addicted nine year olds.This grossly expensive movie is not even as satisfying as an average Star Trek TOS episode, and just consider the primitive technology they had to do the special effects in the 60s, or likewise the brilliant Forbidden Planet movie in 1956. So if they actually want people of all ages to enjoy this movie, they should heap a lot more money and attention on getting good writers to put together a really strong and sparkling script, which this one was not remotely.e.g. using the London Eye was a dumb idea, it's not famous or interesting enough, it's not the Taj Mahal, the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State building or British Houses of Parliament or Golden Gate bridge or whatever.But in conclusion, despite this mediocre follow up to the first fun, exciting and unapologetic movie, let's hope that when the Silver Surfer said ""All that you know is at an end"", which line was probably the only truly memorable thing in the whole movie, he didn't mean THE FRANCHISE.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

It's severely detracting from what little plot the film has already. I mean, parading Torch's ""capitalist"" uniform for 10 scenes? Massive Dodge logos on the jet? I'm sure that if I pause the film, I'll see Dodge hood ornaments and Dodge-like grills on the front of the jet.

431,sepsta,Stan Lee hang your head in shame you money-grabbing old goat!!!,2,18 June 2007,"Galactus? No, it seems the biggest threat to the Fantastic Four is Tim ""Destroyer Of"" Story!Okay, I admit it. I'm a big fan of the Marvel universe, and I've always found Galactus particularly intriguing. Even though I thought the first FF movie sucked big time, when I heard the sequel would revolve around the Silver Surfer & Galactus I was psyched! Possibly more than I had been for a movie since X-Men or maybe even Return Of The Jedi! Now although I adore the comics, I can forgive changes for the big screen. I didn't complain (too much) about the re-writing/complete ignoring of the Phoenix origin in X-Men 2/3, or the lack of any Secret Wars origin for the alien symbiote in Spiderman 3 (or that Topher Grace is far too small and wimpy to play Eddie Brock/Venom). Even when watching the first FF movie, I didn't mind Michael Chiklis being way too small as the Thing because he portrayed the character well. I should have known better than to get my hopes up! I have NEVER been so disappointed in all of my life! There are a LOT of things wrong with this movie. Frankly, with the exception of Chiklis and Chris Evans, the acting was poor. Ioan Gruffudd is a plank, Andre Braugher was wasted & don't get me started on Julian McMahon! Why was Doom even in this movie? I see people say Jessica Alba can't act but I don't have a problem with her in these films because to me Sue Storm has always been a limp character anyway. Her lack of sexual chemistry with Gruffudd is obvious, and at times she looked like she had more of a fancy for her brother than her fiancé! I understand that the writers perhaps felt the need to cut back on the grandiose cosmic back-story of Galactus for the sake of the (obviously) young demographic they were aiming for, but there is nothing there at all! All we see is a massive space-tornado! There is no explanation of why Galactus wants to destroy Earth! There is not even any indication whatsoever that Galactus is a sentient being! We are told nothing! As for the Silver Surfer, well, I thought that visually he was the one saving grace in this pile of garbage. Kudos to Doug Jones, and to the CGI guys for a great job. Charismatic though his voice may be, Lawrence Fishburne was perhaps the wrong choice for the voice of the Surfer. Although I could be wrong as he does not have a lot of dialogue, and the script writers have taken all of the feeling from the character. The surfer is usually filled with more angst than a My Chemical Romance fan, but there was none of that here for Fishburne to convey. And the whole 'seperate the Surfer from his board and he'll be powerless' thing. Oh my God! Did the studio shove 100 monkeys with 100 typewriters into a room to get that plot line? Terrible! Turning Johnny into a rip off of the Super Skrull? Awful. What was the point of the Frankie Raye character? Anyone who knows the comics will know what happens to her, but in this movie she is completely unnecessary. And the ending? Absolutely Abysmal. Surfer goes boom, takes out the massively more powerful being that gave him his powers in the first place. Uh-huh. Just like that. Hooray! Earth is safe, thanks to the Fantastic Four. Er, no, wait, they didn't do squat! Right, comic fan rant over. But even if I had never read the comics, this movie would still be a disaster, filled with horrible dialogue and plot jumps. It seems like a lot of reviewers the only good thing I can say about it (CGI Surfer aside) is that it's still better than the first one! Tim Story needs a good slapping, the butcher! Stan Lee needs to take a long hard look in his gold-plated diamond-encrusted mirror hanging on wallpaper made of hundred dollar bills and ask himself why he is allowing his fine legacy to be turned into trash like this.

433,milwaukee_psych_fan,Hits the Comic Book Sweet Spot,9,21 June 2007,"I'm a little confused about all the negative reviews. This movie is highly entertaining. I confess that I am sucker for these movies and will go see even the worst of them in the theater but I was prepared to pan this one and was pleasantly surprised. This is in the second class of comic book movies, the class that appreciates what it is and shoots for maximum entertainment with not too much cornball. The first class would be the new Batman movie, the last Punisher and the first two X-Men (and to a lesser degree the new Superman), which are real, thoughtfully directed movies with character depth. Even the superpowers in these movies are basically low key (as compared to the comic book) and you have a sense that the adventure could actually take place in the real world. Then there is the next level, which goes for the, er, more fantastic aspects of the story, and emphasizes action and perhaps cuts a few corners to achieve its goals but basically works like a good comic book. That's where FF2 fits, right along with the first 2 Spiderman movies, director's cut Daredevil, X3, Hulk and the old Batman series. These are fun in their own way but often contain a number of flaws that some folks for various reasons can't get past. Daredevil was too much like an MTV video, the Hulk was too disconnected and cerebral, X3 just didn't live up to the first two, etc. The last class is the class for those movies that don't know where they fit, and consequently just feel like a mess of contradiction, corniness and just plan bad movie making. These are the Ghost Riders and Elektras of the world, and also the first Fantastic Four. That movie tried to be in the second class, but was too bogged down by a bad script, bad acting and most importantly I think, a low budget campy feel that seemed to suggest that the studio brass just wasn't quite sure how much money they wanted to sink into it. I kinda liked the ensemble feel to the movie, but it ultimately doesn't work. FF2 is a giant step forward with real conflicts (Johnny as team member, Sue and Richard with the normal life) and the whole Silver Surfer arc was fabulous. I didn't think the ending was that clichéd really (well you can see it from a mile away but still) it just seemed to work. And the action is ratcheted way up, with tons of little moments that are true to the comic book form (sue turning into flames, doom sabotaging the surfer in the forest, etc). All in all just a really good time.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
434,Nick-Kentros,"Good, but...it could have been SO much better",6,27 June 2007,"This movie is OK. It is also a damn shame, because the Fantastic Four and the Silver Surfer story lines provided for some of the greatest Comic Books ever written. This movie breezes through them with a modest amount of interest, but very little creativity.First the good parts. The cast is still spot on, and the characters were acted well for the most part. Jonny Storm (Chris Evans) was probably the stand out character here, showing the most development. Ben Grimm (Micheal Chiklas) probably played the Thing as good as anyone could have, but he was given nothing to work with, left as a character still mildly upset with his appearance, but mostly for comic relief, which is a real waste. Iaon Grufford and Jessica Alba do a mediocre job at the whole love aspect, and Alicia Masters (Washington) does as much as she can.The Surfer was masterfully portrayed by Doug Jones and well voiced by Lawrence Fishburn, but this is also probably the biggest problem in the movie. The Surfer was completely under/misused. He was one of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's most complex character, and very little of the Pathos evoked by Norrin Radd was felt in the movie. He was kind of a Evil until turned Good character.Which is kind of the problem with the movie. It has all the right parts and story lines (The Surfer turning on Galactus, His correlation of Sue Storm to Shalla Ba, and Dr. Doom stealing the Surfer's board/powers) from the comics, but it just lightly glazes over all of them making them feel shallow and cheap.As a fan, I was left feeling satisfied because I finally saw a Silver Surfer movie, but also disappointed, because this movie is just not as great as it could have been. They should have shifted the focus of this movie from pop-corn summer fluff, to a more fan oriented true to comic serious action flick.But...what can you do, it's still enjoyable, and Silver Surfer fans are still glad that the Surfer gets some screen time (and possibly a sequel?)",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Every time the F4 got together, I was half expecting to hear some ""Let's go team!"" kind of cheese.The commercials, especially with great voice-overs from Laurence Fishburne as the Silver Surfer, lead me to believe there was going to be some great, intelligent dialogue between the characters. I hear the Surfer Silver say ""All that you know is at an end"" and expect it to be the beginning of some intelligent dialogue about why he's here, what's going to happen, etc. Instead, he just leaves it at that and flies away. I was like, WTF?? That's it?? ""Perhaps later"", I thought. Nope, that was as deep as the movie got, I kid you not. Basically, there isn't really a story line.

It's not a big deal to me if a movie isn't faithful to every single detail of the original material. But.. come ON. Galactus is such a GREAT character, how could they reduce him to a one-dimensional villain that appears only in the final moments of the film, just to be killed by his own herald? In the comics Galactus isn't a villain, he's considered an essential part of the universe. There's a lot of possibilities with this character; this could have been a really interesting film.Instead it's a bunch of lame jokes, predictable action sequences, and fair-to-middling CGI effects.Oh and I must comment on Jessica Alba here. She appears to have about nine pounds of makeup on her face during this film. Please, someone, chisel that crap off her face. Maybe then her face will actually move and she'll come closer to something approximating ""acting"".I'll give it three stars because it's not totally incoherent (it's trite and shallow yes, but it's not unwatchable) and one more star because I thought the brief scene with Stan Lee was cute.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
443,theinvisiblearrow,Best comic to movie title.,10,3 February 2008,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is the closest thing to the comics. After disappointments (as a comic fan) with such films like X-Men and Spiderman finally Marvel had released a decent comic to motion screen movie.Fantastic Four portrait the story with humour, romance and a realistic approach even though the story is 'farfetch'. With excellent acting and great on screen passion Fantastic Four was a dream come true.After an unsuccessful first film - even thought it was a great set-up to the story - and a better later release with the extended addition. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a great addition in the history of film. And hoping for a third movie with the Inhumans, a man can dream.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

Bad acting, horrible humor everywhere and its so inyour face and lame, bad special effects and the galactocloud on acid?! What was Tim Story smoking when he directed this film? Marvel's worst year was last year, 2007. 2007 was the worst year for Marvel movies with Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer being the worst of the worst. At least Spider-Man 3 had some passable entertainment,this did not. In fact Batman & Robin had more entertainment than this, yes Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin was about 10 times better than this turd of a movie! Don't see this one! I wouldn't even get it on bootleg for free!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
445,g_imdb-532,Horrid,3,12 June 2008,"This movie is so bad I decided to sign up for an account just to let people know. If you want to laugh at a cheesy movie with the DNA of Adam West's Batman (but not as compelling), then you might get a kick out of it. I recommend making this movie into a drinking game.Nothing about this movie works.I never really felt like anyone was in danger. No Drama. The action is slow and poorly choreographed. The special effects look like poop. The actors seem to be on vacation there is 0 chemistry. Camera work / lighting is shoddy and gives the whole production a 'made for TV"" quality.Basically if you watch this movie you get the sense that nobody gave a crap about it. I'd rather watch a B-movie made by people that care, you can forgive a lot of things if there is some emotion, but at the very best this movie is laughable.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
446,mughi7,Comfortable slippers for $130 million,8,15 June 2007,"I am back from the encounter that I have anticipated and dreaded for the past two years...back, from seeing FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER.Somehow, I never thought I would come away from it quite like this. I think maybe it's not a great movie. I do think, however, that it is a good summer popcorn movie. And I also think that it is a TERRIFIC Fantastic Four movie! Basically, the studio spent $130 million just so I could feel like I was putting on an old, comfortable pair of slippers...returning me to a comic book that I had started reading at the age of 10 (and stopped reading at 25).The bantering and bickering between the team here is absolutely perfect, and had me chuckling and even laughing throughout the film. It's enough to overcome certain weaknesses, like the FF's uncomfortable alliance with the military, and the apocalyptic effects-laden ending where the team sort of becomes irrelevant (although another huge CGI piece, involving a fight with the Surfer on the Thames, manages to keep the FF very much in the foreground). Johnny's adaptation from immature, egotistical teenager to immature, egotistical adult still works completely, Ben is much more comfortable in his rocky skin, Reed is right there sneaking in more work behind Sue's back, and Sue still dreams of nothing more than a normal life. The Surfer might have been CGI, but I had no awareness of that fact at all while watching. And even my dismay at seeing Doctor Doom bounce right back in movie number two--seeming to be more of a limited mindset to the franchise (a la Lex Luthor, Magneto, Green Goblin, et al.) than a statement about being the big nemesis--evaporated completely when I realized they were playing out another classic storyline from the original comic.Ninety minutes might have sounded short to me, but the movie was perfectly packed with character and action, and fully satisfying at its conclusion, leaving me exhilarated and feeling like I had champagne in my veins. As a matter of fact, I was tempted to stay and watch it a second time--which has me totally flabbergasted, considering no movie has given me that urge for something like 25 years! I can only hope this does well enough to bring us a third film in the series, and that the filmmakers are comfortable enough with it to feel they don't have to once again destroy the world merely to justify the making the movie.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
447,levraphael,Unbelievably bad,1,10 November 2007,"This movie didn't even make it to sophomoric; you'd have to invent a term and call it freshmanic or something like that. The script was flat, dull, boring, without life, charm, interest, excitement. The attempts at humor fell consistently flat and I won't even go into all the logical holes except to say that the ending could have come much earlier, given what we find out about the Silver Surfer, and given that the movie seemed long at 90+ minutes. Any super hero movie that spends this much time on a wedding doesn't deserve more than one star. I loved the comics, loved the first movie, and couldn't believe this one was such a letdown.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
448,chestond,Please give me back 92 minutes of my life!!,2,16 June 2007,"Wow. It really does pain me to be such an avid Marvel fan. For years now, I've eagerly anticipated the release of each and every Marvel film, animated or live action, and each one, with a few exceptions, has tossed another dagger into my back. Having just seen the horrible excuse for a movie known as ""The Invincible Iron Man"", I was really hoping this film would erase the sins of the first film and win me back. BOY, was I wrong!! Granted, as with most Marvel movies, if you don't know a thing about the Fantastic Four from the comic books, the original movie was pretty good. It's sequel doesn't even have THAT leg to stand on. Failure #1: Dr. Doom is back, but even though he is asked multiple times how he survived, we never do get an explanation. Failure #2: We see Dr. Doom with his mask and armor, then when the mask comes off, his face is badly scarred. Are they erasing their grave mistake of giving Dr. Doom superhuman abilities, with the mask and armor being just for show? Nope. He still shoots energy bolts from his hands and has living metal for skin. Failure #3: The Silver T1000 Surfer! Holy freakin' rip-off, Batman! Failure #4: We never even SEE Galactus!! He rolls in, Independence Day style, as a huge billowing cloud of smoke, and that's all we ever see. Failure #5: The only real fight scene in the whole movie is Super Skrull Johnny Storm vs Silver Doom? Good grief... Failure #6: The ""climactic finale."" Everyone is scrambling around for the whole movie, trying desperately to save the planet and when the huge final confrontation with Galactus finally arrives, all we get is the Surfer floating up, getting in the fetal position, then releasing all his power in a blinding white light with both disappearing. I've never been more disappointed in an action movie's finale in my LIFE!!Sufice to say, even though I usually buy all Marvel movies, this one will not be a part of my vast collection.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

450,guy_one,Very Entertaining,8,4 August 2007,"'4 : Rise of the Silver Surfer' is what a good slick entertaining movie should be. Of course it could be better or might not win awards, but it is fun to watch.Similar other 'comic' movie sequel out this summer was slow and drag. 'Silver Surfer' has no such problems.On this site the current rating is 6.3, which is underrating it. It deserves minimum 8.To all who have not seen it, I would suggest not get biased by negative reviews.I recommend it to anyone who just want to watch a FUN movie !",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
451,blong2,"Not at all a Good movie, but it is Awesome.",8,17 June 2007,"This movie is exactly what it should have been. Absolute trash, but completely entertaining. This movie has absolutely no resonance, no social importance, no higher truth to bring to the world. But look, Jessica Alba is hot and the makers milked that cow for all it was worth. The script is so completely empty that its emptiness reaps substance out of spite. It's camp that seems to take itself seriously. Exactly what I was looking for but didn't completely get when I bought my ticket for Snakes On A Plane. The film never quite lapses into parody, though, which is refreshing. Sure, stupid stuff happens, but the movie just keeps chugging along like a champ. For instance, the possibility of the Four disbanding is a secondary conflict that doesn't appear until smack-dab in the middle of the film. It is hardy talked about again until the end, when the conflict is resolved in less than six lines. No nods, no winks, just keeps chuggin'. If Hollywood is going to make crap movies, I wish they were as unapologetic as this. Then I wouldn't complain at the screen so much; I'd just smile. That's what I did throughout this entire movie.Also, the Fanasticar is a Dodge. Laugh Out Loud.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
452,maweds,Really entertaining addition to the marvel franchise!,10,13 June 2007,"I just saw the premier of this and I have to say, it is one of the best Marvel movies ever. The special effects are even better than X3 and Ghost rider, and the Silver Surfer is beautiful to watch.The story this time is more interesting, and its nice to finally see superheroes being given recognition and funds to carry out their work by the government. All the actors fit their characters perfectly, and really bring a lot of energy and zest to their roles. This time its a lot funnier, and Reed richards is geekier than ever in his science geek - cum - superhero role.The movie never drags, although sometimes the humor that involves The Thing is pretty lame, and dumbs down the movie a lot, while most of the scientific stuff is mentioned to the viewer in a ""you wont get it anyway"" summary type explanation that isn't always convincing.However, the look of this movie is so grea that you have to see it, and especially the ""day after tomorrow"" type disasters that SILVER SURFER brings along with him, including draining the river Thames in London.Againi, the cast looks great, with Jessica alba beautiful as usual and Lee evans looking really buff and toned.My advice - go watch it and enjoy yourself instead getting scared straight or bored straight watching all the other ""big"" summer sequels.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
453,ian-691,"A welcome improvement on FF1, good fun all the way",8,18 June 2007,"I enjoyed it, mostly. First of all, it was ten times better than the groan-awful disappointment of FF1. I know this isn't setting a very high bench-mark, but credit where it's due: they aimed to improve and they did. The story was cleaner, leaner, better directed, easier to follow and easy to enjoy. All the four leads were better and more comfortable in their roles, although personally I still think Jessica Alba was a seriously bad choice. Minor improvements all round in terms of art direction, set design, make-up (The Thing is slightly better this time around) and costume. As for the SFX... brilliant in places, acceptable-to-good most of the time, just a few puzzling rough edges (they still haven't quite got how to portray Reed stretching, and it still looks painfully obvious where the actor ends and the CGI takes over).The Surfer himself was quite a success, I thought. Having seen the early trailers, I was concerned that no matter how well he was done, he would suffer in comparison with all our happy memories of the silver robot from Terminator 2. It turns out not so. The Surfer works very well on screen, and was captivating enough (with enough 'presence') to make me forget about the Terminator movie and just enjoy him as a character in his own right. * Very minor spoiler * I really liked the fact that we got to see the Surfer in his normal, super-powered form and his tarnished, grayish, less shiny, de-powered form. I thought this was a cute touch, and worked very well. Anyone expecting anything other than mindless fun, comic-book action and eye candy-a-plenty is mad. That's all it aims to be and all it could aim to be. And on that basis, I'd say the makers have delivered. 8 out of 10 if in a generous mood.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
454,jpr097,Instantly forgettable,4,27 October 2007,"I watched this movie last night and it is now 7.30am the next morning and I am struggling to remember what actually happened in it. Have you ever seen a movie which instantly leaves your mind due to it having no redeeming features? For starters, it took about 20 minutes to actually reveal itself as a ""super hero action flick"", instead, crawling along thinking it was a gossip magazine show (Reed & Sue's wedding). Other than a couple of very good effects with the surfer, the movie contained nothing that I could see that would make you recommend it to a friend. I am at a loss as to who played Sue Storm. I thought it was Jessica Alba, but the girl I saw on screen looked nothing like her. When you see it, go back to the first one or even ""Into the Blue"" and compare the pretty girl to the one you see here. This movie is riddled with disappointments and when you do see it, don't say i didn't warn you.",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer
455,timshea,This movie was terrible,1,26 June 2007,"If you liked this movie, it's because you have the mind of a 13-year-old. Awful script. Just awful.Superhero movies don't have to be devoid of true character depth and expertly woven dialogue, but they seem to be getting worse in those respects and this film is at the top of the list as far a Hollywood studio crap.The acting is teeeeerrrrrrrrrible. In fact, the acting in this movie sucked so bad, I can't really say if I even remember the direction or the the lighting being good or bad. The special effects definitely weren't spectacular.All in all, I will say that it's sliiiiiightly better than 300, which is the biggest disappointment I've ever encountered in a movie theater. Ever (I even went to the Apple store to listen to Zack Snyder and Fong, his DP, talk about their film-making process, which got me pumped on top of already being a fan of Frank Miller's work). If you liked 300, chances are you didn't read Frank Miller's graphic novel...because if you did, you wouldn't be able to stomach the film version, much in the same way that a person with any sense of superheroes and the infinite possibilities they give filmmakers to make really stupendous material should not have liked F42.Zach Snyder, stick to commercials...Tim Story, grow a pair and make your next superhero film for moviegoers with more than 2 brain cells.-And I'm out!",Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer

At one point a woman points a pistol at the four superheroes and the surfer AND they honestly try to talk her out of shooting them.. umm! They're superheroes!! Is there a reason they can't disarm a woman with a pistol? There's hardly any action, the sequences which are in the film are pointless. There's all sorts of lame worthless subplots, like Sue getting married... who cares? It's an action movie! I love the part where they have to fly a helicopter from New York to London to save the London Eye... why can't they fly? What lame superheroes. Also, last time I checked, helicopters can't fly from NY to London, especially not in five minutes...then back to NY a few minutes later, please. Where's the action plot?

The joking between The Thing and the Human Torch is flat and has no comedy the dancing scene at the nightclub, was that also supposed to be comedy??I watched this film almost to the end, throughout the movie bizarre things kept happening. Now I can accept that it is fantasy, I can even accept the draining of the Thames, even though its a tidal river... fine, no problem. But why on earth did the characters make the choices they made? After Reeve agrees to help the general, builds the detector and then the device to knock him off his board why does the general turn on him. And the ""torture scene"" what was he torturing him for??? They asked no questions and there seemed to be no point.

Jessica Alba has no charisma and looks like she's reading from the script. And I really couldn't get past the fake blue eyes and blonde hair. Add to that the complete lack of chemistry with Ioan Gruffud and you have a fizzle of a movie. Perhaps cardboard cutouts might have solicited more emotion. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all about mindless action, special-effect riddled movies, but this one was a dud.

460,ianmurphy82,Fantastic Four... not really fantastic,1,3 October 2007,"It is truly sad when Stan Lee cameo's as someone not joining the party. OK the first movie, despite it's obvious issues was a GREAT set-up movie. Standing alone with out a conclusion, not so much. The second movie had everything set up, just take it from there. No, no, no. The pop culture had to turn this movie into a crappy version of the superhero real world. There is no real plot, the fights last moments, no one is killed(not even sue), and everyone learns a lesson... True love is worth it all. I am not against that statement but when watching FF I think that maybe some GOOD plot(besides SS, who was the only saving grace) should have been developed. All be it cool that they incorporated Doom stealing the board but if you don't have the time to dedicate to a solid FIGHT, not CGI, don't bother. More focus should have been put on... crap I can't think of a single thing in that movie they could have focused more on. I mean nothing was developed enough to actually pay attention to, besides Johnny being more obnoxious and Ben being rude. I mean seriously people if you don't waste your money and time on CRAP, they might get the hint and stop making it. It could have been epic... it's a sad loss.
