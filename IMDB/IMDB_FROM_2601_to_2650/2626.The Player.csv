0,MartinHafer,Worth seeing a second and a third time....,9,12 September 2016,"I am surprised that the IMDb trivia section is so short for this film. After all, it's jammed full of references to earlier films and is full of actor cameos. Because of this, it's clearly a film that bears re- watching in order to catch the many small details many would often miss. Also, because this film is ultra-famous, already has many reviews and is beloved by many, I'll keep my review relatively short. Suffice to say that it's a film lovers and insiders dream movie.The film begins with an insanely difficult scene that sets the stage for the film. It's all in one long take where the camera moves all over a wide area on a film studio lot. But instead of being intimate, it feels almost like the viewer is hiding and peering at the many different things occurring simultaneously. This is brilliant, as the film does have a real voyeuristic quality...with many shots that are not traditionally framed but are as if you are watching in the near distance. What follows is a very dark anti-fairy tale set in modern Hollywood. Instead of the usual story of a person working hard and doing good and ultimately being rewarded, this is pretty much the opposite. With a total jerk-face (Tim Robbins) screwing people over and even killing someone...and the consequences of this. It's obviously meant as an attack on many Hollywood types--the users, the superficial and the vaguely talented. Overall, a superb film that works very well due to wonderful direction and a black hole-dark script filled with cynicism.",The Player
1,Leofwine_draca,Good-natured Hollywood satire,6,18 July 2015,"Robert Altman's THE PLAYER is a comic murder mystery set within the confines of Hollywood itself. The main character, played with skill by Tim Robbins, is a slimy studio executive who spends his days either greenlighting or turning down various scripts proposed to him by writers. When he starts to receive threatening postcards from somebody he's turned down, he takes matters into his own hands...with drastic consequences.The main emphasis of THE PLAYER is on its self-referencing, some four years before SCREAM came out and became the popular post-modern film satire. THE PLAYER's achievements are more subtle, and the humour is more character focused, but anyone with any interest in Hollywood and its history whatsoever will be in their element here. There's a realistic, chaotic feel to the storyline, where characters go off the rails but are nonetheless constrained by a tightly-ruled empire.It's hard to mention THE PLAYER without mentioning the endless star cameos. They're plentiful and constant, and you could watch the film on mute just for the faces: Angelica Huston, Cher, Peter Falk, Susan Sarandon, the list is endless. Somebody asked me the other day which film has the most cameos in it and I think this would have to be the one. The ending, with a special pair of celebrity cameos, is absolutely hilarious and a real high point of the movie for me.",The Player
2,SnoopyStyle,Mystery with the Altman style,7,4 January 2014,"Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is a studio executive who is receiving death-threatening postcards. He confronts writer David Kahane whom he thinks is sending the postcards. Only things get out of control.This is Robert Altman's sharp biting satirical look at self obsessed Hollywood. Everybody is pitching, everybody is fast talking, and everybody is scheming. This has the Altman style of overlapping conversations. The other interesting thing to watch for is the massive cast of Hollywood stars in cameos. This works as a mystery and satire. There is the minor problem that Tim Robbins is not a likable character. I find no way to root for this man. But it's a good movie none the less.",The Player
3,classicsoncall,"""You're on my list pal. Nothing's gonna change that.""",9,22 May 2018,"Well if this isn't a film for movie buffs, then I don't know what is. Oh, and it's a brilliant story too! I started a list of my own of all the cameo spots and stopped at about twenty or so because they just kept on coming. Seeing Steve Allen at the Mellen (Sydney Pollack) party made me do a double take because I didn't know when this film was made and I knew Allen passed on a long time ago. The story has a couple of twists that are ingenious and tend to have the viewer keep one's guard up. Like the character of David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio), who's made to seem so obvious that he's the spurned writer who's sending Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) the death threat postcards, that you immediately brush him off as the guy Mill has to watch out for. Then there's Lyle Lovett, slinking around in the shadows following Griffin looking like he's about to waste him, and it turns out he's a detective. Very cleverly done, as were all the hints dropped about how this movie might end with the viewing of 'Habeus Corpus'. This is definitely a movie to watch more than once as I thought I had picked up on most of the guest shots, but the credits at the end of the picture revealed a whole bunch more that I never caught the first time around. And if that weren't enough, there's a great piece of trivia the film offers with that murder scene where Tim Robbins' character kills Kahane by ramming his head into the pavement and drowning him in standing water. In the 2003 movie ""Mystic River"", Sean Penn's character drowns his long time friend believing he killed his daughter. The friend's name was Dave Boyle, played by Tim Robbins!",The Player
4,gavin6942,Great Comeback for Altman,8,14 May 2015,"A Hollywood studio executive (Tim Robbins) is being sent death threats by a writer whose script he rejected - but which one? We start with the opening tracking shot, which is really an achievement. Not record-setting, but still pretty fantastic. Then for the next two hours, we get an amazing list of cameos. This does make it rather unusual when the actors were not playing themselves, however. Why is Julia Roberts herself but Tim Robbins is not? Does Tim Robbins exist in this world? Regardless, the film offers great roles for Vincent D'Onofrio and Lyle Lovett. Lovett is a natural quirky police officer, and D'Onofrio is a top-notch actor when in the right role. This may be one of his top three performances.The movie ushered in a new period of filmmaking for Altman, who continued on to the epic adaptation of Raymond Carver's short stories, ""Short Cuts"" (1993). Those two combined really gave Altman a solid third act, after his disappointing decade of the 1980s.",The Player
5,lee_eisenberg,Hollywood endings and non-Hollywood endings,10,12 March 2007,"After many years of semi-obscurity, Robert Altman made a full-scale comeback with the blistering satire ""The Player"", about Hollywood. Tim Robbins plays producer Griffin Mill, working in a studio. He gets pitched thousands of scripts every year, but has to choose twelve. Day in and day out, he hears ridiculous suggestions like ""The Graduate 2"" - from, who else?, Buck Henry - and so he usually tells people that he'll get back to them. But one day, he tells this to the wrong person, and he starts getting threatening postcards from this unidentified individual. Finally, it all boils over.Aside from simply the main plot, this movie gives you the sense of several things. One gets the feeling of how weird the Hollywood world is, and how unpleasant it must be to have to be part of that world. Even when a director suggests a realistic movie without top stars, everyone immediately wants a happy ending and top stars. There are cameos from more movie stars and singers than I could count, and they're usually egomaniacs at best, total creeps at worst (I wonder if any of what the movie portrays mirrors what went into making the movie). But probably the most interesting aspect is how several times throughout the movie, they mention the movie's plot as an idea for a movie.Overall, this must be one of Robert Altman's coolest movies. It's got the feeling of his movies, what with everyone talking at once, and a no-holds-barred look at its topic. I definitely recommend it. Also starring Greta Scacchi, Fred Ward, Whoopi Goldberg, Vincent D'Onofrio, Peter Gallagher, Dina Merrill, and the numerous stars in cameos.",The Player
6,jboothmillard,The Player,8,15 September 2011,"There are not many films from Hollywood that focus on Hollywood itself, Sunset Boulevard is considered one of the greatest for showing the darker side of the movie making business, and this one also featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die is recommended as well, from BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Robert Altman (MASH, Nashville, Godford Park). Basically hot shot Hollywood studio executive Griffin Mill (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Tim Robbins) is in charge of hearing a movie pitch (sometimes he asks for twenty five words or less) from a scriptwriter and decides whether their idea has the potential to be made, be successful and make money, but he rejects thousands. Lately his job is danger of being taken over by new arrival story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher), and he has recently been receiving threatening ""blood letter"" postcards from supposedly a rejected scriptwriter. With the anonymous writer giving a date to when he was rejected Mill back tracks through past rejected scripts to the exact date, and he finds an address which he decides to visit in person and call the telephone number also, to see for himself who picks up, and it appears to be June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi). It is after this however that he finds and concludes that it is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio) stalking him, when he tracks him down watching his favourite film, The Bicycle Thief, and they go for a drink together where he pretends like he recognises him from their previous encounter. Eventually their discussion outside in the bar parking lot turns into an argument and aggressive fight, but Mill manages to drown Kahane in a slope puddle, and to cover his tracks he makes it look like a robbery gone wrong. The threatening postcards do not seem to be over however when he receives another new one, and he attends the funeral of Kahane where he meets June in person, and studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) warns him that in the murder he is known to be the last person to see him alive. Soon enough police Detective Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and partner Detective DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) show up to question him as they think he is guilty of the murder, and after this he gets a postcard suggesting he and the writer meet. While waiting for the mystery writer he is cornered by two screenwriters, one being Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant), pitching their movie Habeas Corpus, a film with no big stars and a depressing rather than happy ending, and then leaving he gets a fax from the anonymous person saying to lift his coat up, and he just survives a near attack from a rattlesnake. He finds his feelings for June, and after persuades his already girlfriend Bonnie Sherow (Cynthia Stevenson) to go away they go to an awards ceremony together, and after those two writers who pitched Habeas Corpus are invited back. Mill convinces Levy it is a good idea and a worthy Oscar contender, of course he actually wants the film to be made and flop, and when it starts going downhill he will jump in and make big changes to make a difference to box office and reclaim his place in the studio. After an encounter with Bonnie at the airport with June he also manages to avoid DeLongpre by pretending to have left his passport behind, so they change their plans and go to an isolated desert spa and build their relationship more. Then Mill gets a call from his attorney that studio head Joel Levison (Brion James) has been fired, and the police require him for a lineup as there was an eyewitness at the murder who can identify the man that did it. A year after the female witness chose DeLongpre in the lineup the film Habeas Corpus has been made with big stars and a slightly more upbeat ending, the writers don't fully approve, Mill has become the new studio head and plans to ""save"" the film, June is now pregnant and his wife, Bonnie is ignored and fired, and he finally gets a call from the postcard writer himself who pitches a film, about a studio executive who kills a writer and gets away with it, but he realises this is blackmail, and Mill makes a deal to make this film, The Player. Also starring Dean Stockwell as Andy Civella, Sydney Pollack as Dick Mellon, Jeremy Piven as Steve Reeves and Gina Gershon as Whitney Gersh. With cameos, to spot and with speaking parts, from ""Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)"" sing Harry Belafonte, Five Easy Pieces' Karen Black, Point Break's Gary Busey, Cher, James Coburn, John Cusack, Midnight Express's Brad Davis, Columbo's Peter Falk, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's Louise Fletcher, City of Angels' Dennis Franz, Dumb and Dumber's Teri Garr, The Right Stuff's Scott Glenn, Jeff Goldblum, Elliott Gould, Cabaret's Joel Grey, Jumanji's David Alan Grier, Anjelica Huston, MASH's Sally Kellerman, Jack Lemmon, Andie MacDowell, Malcolm McDowell, Nick Nolte, Burt Reynolds, Julia Roberts, Mimi Rogers, Diamonds Are Forever's Jill St. John, Susan Sarandon, Rod Steiger, Patrick Swayze, I Heart Huckabees' Lily Tomlin, Austin Powers' Robert Wagner and Bruce Willis. Robbins gives a good sly performance, and it is great fun to spot the various big stars popping up, hanging around in scenes and getting close to the main character, this doesn't distract the story too much as it is quite engaging with the murder prospect, and also the things going on concerning the Hollywood system seem very convincing, it is a most watchable satire. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Editing and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay.

7,ccthemovieman-1,Insider's Jokes Don't Necessarily Connect With General Audience,5,17 December 2007,"A ton of celebrity cameos was the main thing that made this movie fun to watch, but once was enough. I wouldn't watch it again because there simply aren't enough ""good guys"" to suit me. The film is entertaining but has too nasty a tone to it. The language was rougher than it needed to be, but that's no surprise when you have Tim Robbins and Whoopi Goldberg starring.The story gives a look at many of the shallow people who run Hollywood. That automatically earns high praise from national film critics. Despite their innate love of Hollywood and films they somehow always love it when a film trashes the business! Go figure.This black comedy mainly spoofs film executives. The filming is different in that you see one long scene with the camera on a crane taking turns following different people. Some of that is very clever, like the story, but I found a general smugness in this film that bordered on hypocrisy. The people who made this sometimes come off - through the film - like the folks they're criticizing.....if that makes sense. Robbins is good at coming across as smug....almost too good. It seems natural for him. (I can say the same about Chevy Chase and his roles.)Also, I find most films about Hollywood like this one: too much an inside joke for us non-film folks to really enjoy. It's like they made this film for themselves. I'm not surprised this movie was a box-office dud, since I don't think they really cared what the average guy in the seats thought about it - only their film peers.",The Player
8,rmax304823,Let's Make a Movie!,8,10 March 2007,"Robert Altman was a hard man to get hold of. While shooting this movie, an actor asked what the dialog was supposed to be about -- what should he say? Altman's reply: ""I can't tell you what to say."" His first big film, ""M*A*S*H"", struck me as slapdash, designed to be funny, and anachronistic, a statement about the absurdity of the Vietnam war set during the Korean war. The football team smokes dope. The doctors take advantage of their station to play golf and insult their superiors. It didn't increase my distaste for our Southeastern Asia adventure, but it left me, as an ex-enlisted man, with a greater resentment of the perks given to officers. After ""M*A*S*H"", his films, always quirky, varied from the barely coherent to the socially nihilistic. Some of them were impossible to sit through. I'd much rather have had a couple of beers with Altman and shoot the breeze than to watch another of his episodic and disjointed productions.Given a good narrative line, though, Altman's bricollage hangs together. TV's ""The Caine Mutiny Court Martial"" was an instance, and so is ""The Player."" It's suspenseful, funny, ironic, and touching. The plot is about as complicated as a game of tic-tac-toe. Tim Robbins, a Hollywood producer, begins to get threatening postcards from a nameless writer whom he once apparently crossed. He accidentally kills the writer he thinks responsible. However, the post cards continue coming. Gulp. Robbins is called in for questioning by the police (Whoopi Goldberg et al) and has to stand in a line up. But no one can identify him as the killer. He winds up marrying the victim's girl friend and living in a rose-covered cottage. Then he gets a call from the real post card sender who is peddling his script about the murder. For an unstated sum, the screenwriter agrees to give the story ""a happy ending."" There isn't space enough to cover all the felicities. It's a savage attack on Hollywood and just about everyone in it, although the multitude of guest stars are treated in a friendly enough fashion. It's the kind of script William Goldman might have written if they'd take his handcuffs off. Example: Peter Gallagher is a rival producer and bids Robbins good-bye because he's off to his Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Robbins (sympathetically): ""Gee, Larry, I didn't know you had a drinking problem."" Gallagher: ""Well, actually, I don't, but that's where all the deals are being made.""The improvisatory techniques work this time around, adding color and unexpected dimension to a story that keep us interested throughout. Whoopi Goldberg, as the Pasadena detective in charge of the case, is questioning Robbins in her office and keeps interrupting herself to ask her staff questions like, ""Where are my tampons? Not these -- I take jumbo, not regular slim."" And while Robbins is slowly going nuts with anxiety on the other side of the desk she is twirling a tampon round and round with her fingertip. When Robbins finally erupts with rubescent indignation she begins to cackle and soon every cop and every secretary in the room is laughing in an unbuttoned way while Robbins' eyes dart crazily from side to side. What a surreal scene.The photography is, to use an adjective that's almost unavoidable in this context, stupendous. And the score by Thomas Newman is both original and effective, aptly extraterrestrial. Even the happy ending theme has an underlying sinister quality.There is only one major character in the film who has any principle. Cynthia Stevenson. At the end, she is fired by her boss, ignored by everyone else, and loses a heel and falls down while hurrying off the lot.This was released more than fifteen years ago, as unbelievable as it seems, and it's a little frightening to run down the cast and crew list and see the number of players who have been shuffled off this mortal coil. Where's the next generation?",The Player
9,moonspinner55,"A commercial comeback for Altman, but it's overloaded with stars...",5,17 October 2007,"Director Robert Altman practically resurrected his quirky film-making career with this in-jokey, acerbic overview of show business, and the many celebrities who dot the cast prove that Altman's prestigious name and reputation made much of Hollywood want to jump on-board. Still, this murder mystery, with studio hotshot Tim Robbins involved in the death of a would-be screenwriter, is wayward and smug, and the star-cameos are like speedbumps in the course of the story. Robbins is carefully handled and efficient, but disappointingly one-note; Whoopi Goldberg is terribly out of place as an investigator on the case (she looks like yet another star-sighting until you realize she's ""in character""). Brightly-made, fairly lively picture is fine as a time-filler, but it isn't engrossing as a crime flick should be. Altman is more interested in having a good time than in trying to top himself. ** from ****",The Player
10,Quinoa1984,the reality of the making of the un-reality of Hollywood,10,2 April 2006,"Once The Player's end credits rolled, I was shaken, but in the kind of way that you are when you hear a really sly, long joke by someone who knows what they're telling is not hysterical but still has a wicked knack that will stay with you or gnaw at your side. Robert Altman's the Player, one of his very best films (maybe his best) made since the 1970's, is as much about the detached, perfunctory nature of these characters as it is a story of a murdering writing executive. It's not a satire in the sense of Dr. Strangelove; there's nothing that's over the top for the audience. But it does get in some notes, practically without any pretense of going about it otherwise, about the sterility of modern Hollywood. As a film buff, while watching this movie I'm not even bowled over by the numerous cameo appearances by Hollywood's main stars and wonderful character actors. That's because Altman, while being un-obtrusive of what the actors are doing on screen, has his focus set very carefully, and it's in this precise kind of mode that it works best.It's not to say Altman's style doesn't have its own voice, and some of the shots in the film- self conscious no doubt- bring out the anti-Hollywood while Hollywood ideas. And working in the framework, not the dependence, of the story lets some interesting things of reality go on. When you see this 8-minute long take at the start of the film, it's getting the music of the film going right away, of the 'money-talks, BS-continues' attitude of a Hollywood studio, not just of the main character Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins). It may be 'just a movie', but it's also one with this constant feel of life going on, as Altman, through Tokin's screenplay, is a fly on the wall as it were. We see Mill, a writing executive, go through a rough patch with a certain writer (Vincent D'Onofrio) who hasn't heard back from him in a while. When a harsh accident occurs, Mill has to keep moving, not just with his job or his details of the night the two had, but with the writer's girlfriend (Greta Scacchi) who start an affair.Altman once said, quite famously, once casting is complete 80% of his work is done. The Player is one of those major examples in Altman's career, and despite the fact that most, if not all, of the supporting actors (who may or may not also be in their cameo roles) are sublime in their roles (Goldberg, Scacchi, Lyle Lovett, and especially Cynthia Stevnenson), it's a key Robbins turn. His career has often had roles where he can lay in a naturalness that other actors might not have gone for. He also fits the role of Griffin Mill much as he did for Andy Dufresne and Dave in Mystic River. Here he has a perfect quality in this character to, as Ebert pointed out, not be un-likable even as he is not a good person. I loved the little facial gestures, the seemingly controlled stares, and the small moments where his upper class facade starts to wear down beneath the bloodless business of making movie deals. His could be for some the only reason to see the film, and rightfully so, as I really don't think Altman would've been able to pull it off with another.It does almost add to what could be frustration for some by the end of the film to see what happens to him, but it actually is after thinking about it more even more satisfying an ending. A question the film ponders for this character is- if he can survive the reality when all he wants is a happy ending in the stories he hears? And through this simplicity some compositions and scenes are quite remarkable; that one single shot of a certain close-up of a sex scene not only plays brilliantly off of a script description earlier, but is one of the best scene-shots I've seen in recent movies. Very well done, if not for everyone.",The Player
11,sunwarrior13,About Hollywood's Moral Bankruptcy,10,27 September 2012,"The Player is a 1992 satirical film directed by Robert Altman from a screenplay by Michael Tolkin based on his own novel of the same title.It is the story of Hollywood studio executive Griffin Mill,played by Tim Robbins,who murders an aspiring screenwriter he believed was sending him death threats.Greta Scacchi,Fred Ward,Whoopi Goldberg,Peter Gallagher, Brion James,Cynthia Stevenson and Vincent D'Onofrio play supporting roles.Around sixty Hollywood celebrities agreed to play themselves in the film. The film has many film references and Hollywood insider jokes. It is a critique of a movie business that treats artists poorly and sacrifices quality for commercial success.Griffin Mill is a Hollywood producer with a studio executive girlfriend Bonnie Sherow. Mill's job is to hear story pitches from screenwriters and decide which films have the potential to get made and which films get rejected. His job is suddenly in danger, though, when up-and-comer Larry Levi begins work at the studio. Rumors swirl that Griffin may be replaced soon by Levi. Griffin has also been receiving threatening postcards, presumably from a disgruntled writer whose pitch he rejected.Griffin delves through records and surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane, who had previously pitched a script to him. Griffin calls Kahane's home and is told by a woman, June, that Kahane is at a movie theater. Griffin goes to the theater in Pasadena and offers Kahane a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. However, Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Griffin's offer. He denies that he sent Griffin any postcards. Kahane pushes Griffin in the parking lot and the two men scuffle. In a rage, Griffin accidentally kills Kahane. Thinking fast, Griffin makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day at work, he receives another postcard, confirming that his stalking writer is still at large. Griffin attends Kahane's funeral and connects with Kahane's girlfriend, June. Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel confronts Griffin about the murder and says that Pasadena Police know Griffin was the last one to see Kahane alive. Pasadena detectives Susan Avery and DeLongpre suspect that Griffin is guilty of murder. They question him and DeLongpre starts to keep an eye on Griffin. The stalking writer leaves a rattlesnake in Griffin's car, causing a near-death experience that makes Griffin realize how he has sudden and deep feelings for June. With his girlfriend Bonnie out of town, Griffin takes June to a Hollywood awards banquet and their relationship grows.Meanwhile, with Levi ever encroaching on his job, Griffin sees an opportunity to save his position. He hears a pitch idea from two writers about a film called Habeas Corpus and instantly recognizes huge problems with the downbeat story. However, he manages to convince Levi that the pitch is golden and the movie will be a guaranteed Oscar contender. Griffin plans to let Levi shepherd the film through production and have it flop miserably. Then Griffin will step in at the last moment and suggest some basic changes to salvage the film's box office potential, letting him reclaim his position at the studio. The Pasadena detectives call Griffin in for a lineup after a witness to Kahane's death comes forward. Griffin catches a big break when the witness identifies the wrong man, Detective DeLongpre, who was placed in the lineup with the other suspects.One year later, studio power players are watching the end of Habeas Corpus with its tacked-on upbeat ending. Griffin's plan to save the movie worked like a charm and he is now a studio executive. While driving home, he gets a pitch over the phone from a man who reveals himself as the postcard writer. The man pitches an idea about a studio executive who kills a writer and gets away with murder. Griffin recognizes the pitch as blackmail and immediately agrees to give the writer a deal. The writer's title for the film is The Player. It ends by showing that June is now Griffin's wife and pregnant with his child.A movie about today's Hollywood which both hilarious and heartless in about equal measure, and often at the same time.A wicked satirical fable about corporate backstabbing and an actual murder in the movie business, The Player benefits from director Robert Altman's long and bitter experience working within, and without, the Hollywood studio system.Also,it was a funny attack on the moral bankruptcy of Hollywood which was embraced by many of the same people it was intended to savage, and restored the director to commercial and critical favor.",The Player
12,Doylenf,A clever but shallow satire that manages to hold interest after a brutal death scene...,6,17 May 2008,"I'm not a Robert Altman fan but THE PLAYER ranks among the best of his crop of overpraised films. At least the performances are first rate without all the overlapping dialog that one had to endure in GOSFORD PARK, but the satire is laid on pretty thick even after the brutal accidental murder scene.TIM ROBBINS plays a Hollywood producer who is unable to shake off the persistence of an aspiring writer without resorting to killing him in a moment of desperation and anger. He gets control of himself thereafter and is able to play innocent, especially after a line-up of suspects including him fails to produce a witness who could identify him as being near the scene of the crime.The biggest in-joke of all is Altman's decision to have a marathon lineup of stars on the sidelines, popping up at every other moment when least suspected, and often with no more than a few seconds of screen time. The film within a film (a sub-plot bearing resemblance to the real film plot) is cleverly used to provide a neat finish to the tale. And in doing so, it utilizes (very briefly) the services of stars like SUSAN SARANDON, PETER FALK, JULIA ROBERTS and BRUCE WILLIS.GRETA SCACCHI, PETER GALLAGHER and DEAN STOCKWELL do well in the most prominent supporting roles but it's TIM ROBBINS who owns the spotlight throughout and he's excellent as the conflicted man who commits a crime and gets away with it in a Hollywood film colony that has no conscience.WHOOPI GOLDBERG's role as Detective Susan Avery is unforgivably coarse and totally unbelievable as a woman whose professional conduct borders on burlesque. Equally ineffective is LYLE LOVETT as a fellow detective amused by her shenanigans.There are plenty of faults, but the film manages to hold the interest with its unique blend of suspense, humor, satire and tragedy. It's a clever piece of work but heavily dependent on the audience getting all the inside jokes about Hollywood and its celebrated denizens.",The Player
13,preppy-3,"Good, but not great",7,14 August 2002,"An executive at a movie studio (Tim Robbins) accidentally kills a writer who he thinks is harassing him.  He tries to cover it up.  Also his job at the studio is in jeopardy as he's competing with a younger, aggressive man (Peter Gallagher).  This was Altman's first Hollywood film after a 12 year absence (""Popeye effectively stopped his career). At first I hated this movie.  Very cold, VERY cynical with not one likable character in it.  Slowly, though, it won me over.  Basically, it's a satire of Hollywood and movie making...but a very vicious one.  The script is great (there are countless great lines) and Altman does his usual great directing job...I love the opening 10-15 minutes which is done without any cutaways--just one long shot.  It's just too cruel at times.The acting is (with one exception) fine.  Gallagher is dead on perfect as the young hot-shot (he was in his 30s when he did this but he looks in his 20s).  Robbins, however, is a disappointment.  He has a blank, depressed look on his face during most of the movie and sleepwalks through his role. In a way that's a good thing.  If he had been real good and convincing in the role this would have been unwatchable.  Also Whoppi Goldberg is hysterical as a police officer investigating the case--watch for the scene with her and a tampon!  Also a huge amount of Hollywood actors appear playing themselves.  It's a lot of fun in certain scenes playing ""who's in this one""?So it's good, but Altman has done better...like ""MASH"" and ""Nashville"". However, this isn't as bad as his worst film (""Popeye"").  So,  I ultimately liked it, but the first half was a trial to sit through.  I give it a 7.",The Player

It was unusual, sure, but often during those ten-minute takes the camera would be static and even when it did move it did so within the confines of one room in the main. In that respect it is meaningless to compare the opening eight minutes of The Player to the complete running time of Rope. Far better, and indeed more logical, to compare it to the opening of Orson Welles' Touch of Evil in which a fluid camera follows, in one take, a car making its way through the border between the US and Mexico, lining up to go through customs, etc, and finally exploding. Perhaps one reason no one brought up Touch of Evil was because The Player, a film made by a journeyman director, would come off worse against a film directed by a genius. Having said that this is a tasty satire on Hollywood, a town and an industry that is by definition beyond satire. The more movies you've seen the more you'll appreciate the referential aspects and the more you know about how films get made and deals are done the more you'll appreciate the 'inside' jokes.",The Player

17,evanston_dad,So This Is What Altman Thinks of Hollywood,8,5 November 2008,"Leave it to Robert Altman to announce his return to Hollywood with a scathing indictment of it.After a decade of working in virtual anonymity, Altman made a comeback with this dark comedy, scoring his third Academy Award nomination as director and his first since ""Nashville"" nearly 20 years earlier. It's instantly recognizable as an Altman film -- the opening of the movie is an 8-minute tracking shot following various conversations about either story ideas or movies in general, including one about famous tracking shots from famous movies.Tim Robbins plays a self-absorbed producer who begins to receive death threats from an unknown writer whose idea Robbins ignored. As he becomes increasingly paranoid, the movie becomes increasingly like a nightmare, and the world of Hollywood begins to become more and more removed from the world of everyone else. Altman vents his frustration and disdain for the asinine business of making movies, even while he suggests that the business is worth putting up with in order to do what he loves. Pretty much everyone who had ever been in an Altman film to that point in time (and many who hadn't) have roles in this movie, some -- Peter Gallagher, Sydney Pollack, Vincent D'Onofrio, Whoopi Goldberg (hilarious) -- playing fictional characters while others -- too many to name -- play themselves. Robbins anchors the film though, with a great performance completely lacking in vanity. Only Altman would choose to do a full frontal male nude scene with the actor caked in mud.""The Player"" is not actually one of my favorite Altman films, but it did signal his return to his typical large-scale ensemble format, and it allowed him to make ""Short Cuts,"" which IS one of my favorites, the very next year.Grade: A-",The Player
18,HotToastyRag,Iconic backstage Hollywood film,6,27 June 2019,"The first scene of The Player is iconic. It's shown in film schools all over the country about how to ad-lib a master shot all in one take, and director Robert Altman is the master that that type of scene. After the first scene, the movie tends to go downhill, but if you're super impressed by it, or if you love movies about Hollywood, you might like it.Tim Robbins stars as an executive who hears pitches from screenwriters all day long about the next big hit. The first scene is hilarious, with cameos from countless screenwriters claiming ""a cross between"" two ridiculously unrelated movies as a way to market their pitches. Tim rejects dozens of pitches a day, and when he starts receiving threatening notes, he and police officer Whoopi Goldberg try to find out which disgruntled writer they're coming from. Add in a romance with Greta Scacchi, and the usual business of the Hollywood grind, and he's got a pretty busy schedule. Stuffed with cameos from over 65 movie stars-no, I won't list them, just look up the full list-as well as a supporting cast comprised of Peter Gallagher, Vincent D'Onofrio, Richard E. Grant, Dean Stockwell, Fred Ward, Lyle Lovett, Cynthia Stevenson, Brion James, and Sydney Pollack, you'll make yourself dizzy with the amount of familiar faces crammed into two hours of screen time.

19,zetes,My pick for Robert Altman's worst film,8,31 May 2001,"Well, maybe I can't say that. There are plenty I haven't seen, and, well, Popeye at least has to be worse. The Player is one of the bitterest, most heavy-handed satires ever made. The sad part is that the focus of Altman's attack is not even close to being completely culpable for the crap it churns out. The cinema is an industry. It has to make money or it will go out of business. The crumminess of most movies only exists because the American public is made up of swine: they want to root in troughs and walk through feces. And it is so expensive to make movies nowadays, that, if a movie doesn't make money, it could destroy many people. Of course, with Hollywood's willingness to bow to the lowest common denominator, it works as a downward spiral. It's getting harder and harder to insult America's intelligence nowadays. Pearl Harbor is #1 at the box office, and plenty of people attest to its greatness. Heck, Shrek, a pile of crap, is being touted, even by critics, as a great piece of filmmaking. What's worse, the media works as a catalyst to it all, angling all reports of success around the money which is made.For an intellectual like Altman to be mad at Hollywood is pointless. Be mad at America. Instead of making The Player, about people just doing their job, why not make a Nashville-style ensemble piece about the idiocy of the common man. They're not going to see it anyway.",The Player
20,Mr-Fusion,It's not the star but the background stuff that's really entertaining,6,11 March 2017,"A major name director does Hollywood satire. That right there is enough to sell a movie. And when ""The Player"" is actually about the business, it's a blast. The studio power structure, the entitled executives, the animosity toward writers . . . it's a culture deserving of a good jab in the rib cage. And Altman shoves pretty much every recognizable face into this thing; it's absurd ow many people show up here.But it's also self-indulgent, and when we're not making fun of the industry or stargazing, the murder mystery really jams on the brakes. This is a deeply cynical movie, so the outcome's not surprising. And Robbins' dance with the law just starts to drag after a while. Whoopi Goldberg actually stole the second half for me; her appearance gave it a much-needed charge.This is entirely worth it for its technical merits (I just know that that opening tracking shot is used in film schools) and it's well acted and directed. But it lost me when the main character became the sole focus.6/10",The Player
21,MovieAddict2016,Adaptation.,10,21 September 2003,"Some Spoilers.""The Player"" opens with a long, tracking shot outside of a Hollywood studio. We see a man walk by (Fred Ward) who complains about how directors use too many cuts in films nowadays, and that they should use long, tracking shots, instead. The irony? The beginning of our movie is using a long, tracking shot.We wind around buildings filled with hoards of famous stars and directors and writers. Griffin Mills (Tim Robbins) is a studio executive - he hears film ""pitches,"" or outlines for film stories. We see Buck Henry (writer of ""The Graduate"") throwing a pitch to him for ""The Graduate: Part II.""It is 1992, and every time a pitch is thrown, we hear a film exec respond to the pitch thrower by saying, ""It should star Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis."" One British man throwing a pitch to Griffin insists that his film shall have no big stars, especially not Julia Roberts or Bruce Willis. He says that he wants no action, no car chases, no sex, no happy ending. And when the hilarious, surprise movie-within-a-movie ending of ""The Player"" starts to unfold. . .well, let's just say that things do not always turn out the way people want them to.And this is what makes ""The Player"" tick. It's a scathing satire, one that the sharpest of film buffs will love for its in-jokes and cameos (over 60!), and the most naive of filmgoers will love for its ironic, good-guys-lose, bad-guys-win story. Griffin Mills (Robbins) has a nice life - a nice car, a nice girl, a nice job, and he's filthy rich. But lately his standing as a film executive has been threatened by the new guy (Peter Gallagher), who is showing lots of potential in the field. One day he gets a postcard with threats on the back. Thinking that the postcard came from a writer he pushed away months ago (Vincent D'Onofrio), he confronts him. One thing leads to another and he ends up killing the writer - unintentionally, we are led to assume, though there are some doubts.But being the ironic movie this is, Griffin has, of course, killed the wrong writer. And so he continues getting postcards and threats - someone even puts a poisonous snake in his car. Griffin becomes more and more paranoid as the days go on, and almost falls to the pressure of police questioning, led by Whoopi Goldberg.In-jokes flow freely. Some big movie buffs might pick up on such references as to Levinson, or ""The Bicycle Thief"" (1942), or movie posters hanging on the walls in the background (""M,"" ""Casablanca,"" etc.). But it will take numerous viewings before you realize that they are more than just there to please film buffs - they are there for irony. Film buffs might be the only ones who pick up on the irony of them, too.This is a movie made for movie lovers, for the movie insiders and for those who like a good laugh. It's a spoof on tinseltown and all its crazy little rituals of getting a film made. This could be called an anti-heroic movie - and I'm sure it has been called that. It's not for those who like poetic justice in their films. Good guys burn and bad guys win. At first I didn't like this, but then I realized that it isn't trying to be anti-heroic - it's being ironic. And let's face it: Irony is funny.""The Player"" reminds me very much of ""Adaptation"" (2002), the story of a writer played by Nicolas Cage who doesn't want to Hollywoodize his script about orchids. ""I just don't want to turn it into a Hollywood thing,"" he says. He says something to the effect of, ""No violence, no drugs, no sex, no people overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end."" The irony is that, in the end, everything he didn't want to happen in his script happens. There's some of that irony in ""The Player,"" plus a little bit more. If you liked ""Adaptation,"" then you've got to see ""The Player."" 5/5.",The Player
22,lasttimeisaw,a thrilling return-to-the-game comeback for Altman after his nadir in the 80s,8,25 January 2018,"Robert Altman's inside-Hollywood meta-comedy THE PLAYER is shot with a shoe-string budget but reverberates with sardonic, rapier-like kicks, and affixed with a chilling frisson that defies ethics and our expectation thanks to Michael Tolkin's trenchant script which brings Tinseltown's treacherous attributes to the forefront. Altman's much eulogized opening gambit, a nearly 8-minute long-take in the lot of a Hollywood studio, vocally pays tribute to Orson Welles' counterpart in TOUCH OF EVIL (1958), is a coup de maître to be rewinded and repeatedly viewed for its sheer coordination of the ensemble and the camera's agility in motion. Taking the center stage is Griffin Hill (Robbins), a young producer whose job is to listen to screenwriter's pitches of their ideas and to assess whether they are marketable enough to merit a go, and this producer-writer correlation is put under scrutiny as Griffin is dogged by anonymous, invective-scribed postcards, which he receives on a daily base, and after combing through telephone records, he gets the idea it is sent from David Kahane (D'Onofrio, bristling with ire and contempt), a bitter writer who might be rankled for receiving the short shrift. But gauging from Griffin's quotidian workload and the ratio of pitches he must disregard (the studio has a yearly quota of 12 to green-light), we don't get why Griffin is so sure it is David. Trying to bury the hatchet by renewing his interest in David's script set in Japan (Sofia Coppola's LOST IN TRANSLATION arrives a decade later in 2003), Griffin seeks him out and ""accidentally"" kills him when verbal vitriol escalating into physical violence, here Altman shrewdly predates the occurrence with Griffin calling David's home, and getting instantly bewitched by the latter's girlfriend June Gudmundsdottir (Scacchi), an Icelandic painter, under a voyeuristic spell. So whether the subsequent accident is a homicide or manslaughter, the answer is quite out there. The rest of story is against all odds, how Griffin gets away with the killing and lives happily ever after with June, does it sound like a joke? Yes, but the engagé Altman is in no fickle mood of maxing out Griffin's quagmire before the anti-climatic reveal: his current post is in a perilous state of being superseded by the new blood Larry Levy (Gallagher), a diligent detective (Lovett) breathes down his neck closely and the relationship with his colleague-cum-girlfriend Bonnie (Stevenson) turns sour as he courts June with tenacious guilt stuck in his throat, in the end of the day, he gets what he wants not what he deserves, and the final turnabout of the fictive movie starring Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis is such a slap in the face of those who harbor an airy-fairy ideology of retaining a writer's integrity in this rotten industry, only tempered by Altman's tongue-in-cheek mordancy that tactfully keep both industry insiders and outsiders entertained but not miffed, not to mention its effervescent star-spotingg game of umpteen celebrity cameos.Tom Robbins is the recipient of Cannes' BEST ACTOR award but unjustly fails to nab an Oscar nomination (the film per se is a 3-times nominee including a well-earned BEST DIRECTOR bid for Altman), who takes us through quite a rollercoaster ride with his portrait of Griffin par excellent, smirky, craven, vulnerable, besotted and careworn, all these facets are contributory to such degree of ambiguity that viewers are inwardly battling against their own conscience in terms of his denouement. Greta Scacchi is given a sizable role to send up the ostensibly exotic, free-spirited type (she might not even hail from Iceland) who just cannot say no to an opportunity of comfort and wealth like anyone else, and whose inner state is tellingly belied in their torrid love-making/confession-denial sequences, a fine achievement. Among the peripheral players, no one stands out significantly in the fray, except for a wisecracking Whoopi Goldberg, who duly earns her stripes with tart and hilarious comedy chops.In retrospect, THE PLAYER is a thrilling return-to-the-game comeback for Altman after his nadir in the 80s, and is among the most phenomenal works tackling the Hollywood hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness by lending an honest-to-goodness spin salted with tacit irony.",The Player
23,paul2001sw-1,Playing at home,8,2 October 2003,"Robert Altman's films all have much in common: the use of long tracking shots; a large ensemble cast; a slightly disinterested view of the travails of the frequently horrible characters; the absence of slickness; a taste for black comedy; and a frequent disregard for the conventions of narrative structure. What's surprising is how variable they are in quality: sometimes he hits the mark (for example, in his recent success 'Gosford Park'); sometimes he fails.  'Pret a Porter', for example, was widely and rightly ridiculed; but many of Altman's efforts leave me cold, semi-random assemblages of nasty people doing nothing particularly much.'The Player', however, is definitely a success.  For once, Altman has something resembling a plot; secondly, he also has something to say, a veteran movie maker turning the spotlight on his own industry.  'The Player' is great fun, but it's also shallow. Even dark films need someone you can like in them, if only to outrage one at the badness of the others; no-one here is nice, but as it's only others equally horrid who end up getting hurt, it's hard to really care.  And for a satire, the bite is limited.  The film turns it's vivid sense of irony frequently on itself, especially in the numerous celebrity cameos, which are highly amusing, but which add a strangely celebratory air to the work: a studio executive who hears the ring of truth in it is, I suspect, more likely to sleep soundly and smugly than cut his wrists in shame.  Well worth watching, but a little more ""heart"", to quote from the script, would not have gone amiss.",The Player
24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"A meta and witty inside-joke, sardonically jabbing at the ribs of tinsel-town.",7,14 March 2018,"'The Player (1992)' is a meta and witty inside-joke, jabbing at the ribs of tinsel-town in a cynical yet comedic way, and it manages to sardonically satirise the entire studio system, with a only little bit of self-aggrandising and perhaps an equal measure of self-deprecating. The picture isn't particularly funny, though it can cause some chuckles, but is instead the kind of sly smile inducing mockery that takes its time to dawn on you and isn't immediately obvious. It's this undercurrent that carries the flick much more than the main plot itself, so much so that the actual narrative becomes a part of the running gag as opposed to a vehicle for the individual jokes to spawn from. It's a unique, and somewhat acquired taste of a, film that's usually enjoyable and equally intelligent. 7/10",The Player
25,gbill-74877,An homage and an indictment,8,24 February 2019,"This film is clever, and in several ways. It manages to be an homage to moviemaking, referencing things like Tod Browning's 'Freaks', Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Rope,' and countless other things, and yet also a scathing indictment of the industry. It builds a suspenseful drama from a couple of angles, as the titular Hollywood director (Tim Robbins) is pursued both by the police and by a mysterious spurned writer who is out for vengeance. It also gives us a large number of celebrity cameo appearances.The early scene where we see Robbins getting pitched again and again with story ideas is very funny, and it's because we see the truth in how the industry thinks (""It's like The Gods Must Be Crazy except the coke bottle is an actress. It's Out of Africa meets Pretty Woman."") Robbins is brilliant and there are so many little things his character does that show how superficial he is - requesting his water be repoured in a water, not wine glass, when he's leaving anyway, or feigning interest in the artistry of Vittorio De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves' but saying maybe they should do a remake of it. On the other hand, he is allowed to explain the situation he's in - only getting to select 12 scripts out of 50,000 he is pitched a year - and under pressure to make profitable films or be moved aside. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Whoopi Goldberg has some hilarious moments in the police station; she's the chief who has no problem talking about the size of her tampons. Cynthia Stevenson is great as the story editor Robbins is dating, that is, until he falls for Greta Scacchi.The ending is devastatingly dark and biting, and also takes a dual form. In the film the production company is making that is supposed to be artistic and authentic, with no stars in the cast and a depressing ending, we find it was made with Bruce Willis dramatically saving Julia Roberts and then uttering one of those cliché Hollywood action-film lines - and that the original writer who was so insistent on his original vision actually sold out as well, so that the film would be popular. The 'happy ending' here is actually sad for filmmaking as art. Meanwhile in real life, where Robbins should pay for what he did, we find he's been promoted and is living a very happy life with his new wife. The 'happy ending' is actually injustice winning out, and 'the player' getting away with it.It's ironic of course, because earlier Robbins has mentioned that to market a film successfully, among other things ""happy endings"" are most important, and here we have that in both senses, but know they're both wrong, and can just sense Altman smiling. The film seems to reflect both deep love and hate for the movie making industry, with hate getting the upper hand, and yet it still manages to feel relatively light and entertaining. With all of the little references and clever dialogue in the film, this would be a good one to re-watch too, and may be worthy of a slightly higher rating.",The Player
26,merklekranz,Dull for Hollywood outsiders ......,3,24 December 2020,"Tim Robbins is in top form, surrounded by dozens of walk ons. Probably more recognizable actors in this film than any other.

If you want to be entertained beyond all the ""in jokes"", then ""The Player"" is one to avoid. This would not be the first time Altman has missed his target either. I should have listened to my instinct that this would be annoyingly artsy. The basic story promotes characters, who to the average movie patron, seem like nothing more than pompous asses.

29,Red-125,Hollywood is not the place for faint of heart or for anyone with a sense of ethics,8,20 July 2015,"The Player (1992) was directed by Robert Altman. Tim Robbins plays Griffin Mill, a studio executive who has the uncanny ability to walk through the quicksands of Hollywood studio politics and somehow stay on solid ground. At one point, he explains that over a thousand scripts are submitted to the studio, and he's the guy who has to decide which 12 films will be made that year. That means 12 people are happy with him, and all the rest are not. In fact, one writer whose script was rejected is sending him death threats.Greta Scacchi plays June Gudmundsdottir, the beautiful young woman Griffin meets while trying to find the writer of the death threats. Whoopi Goldberg plays Detective Avery. Goldberg's a fine actor, but she's burdened with a script that involves a scene about her tampons and her assistant's tampons that's degrading and not even funny.Altman made the film with about fifty of the Hollywood greats and near-greats playing cameos. It's a tour de force to round up that many actors to be on screen for just a minute or less. However, using that many cameo actors is a two-edged sword. As a viewer, you're spending all your time looking to see which face you recognize, when you're supposed to be paying attention to the plot.It doesn't help that Altman uses his characteristic technique of having several characters talking at once. Often, the important lines are not being spoken by actors who are filmed in focus. Someone walking behind the main actors may be saying the really important lines. (Of course, that assumes you can hear the actors. Altman likes his characters to mutter and mumble, and sometimes you just can't make out what's being said by anyone.)Because I have no idea of what really goes on in Hollywood--or anyway, what went on in 1992--I have no way of knowing how accurate Altman's portrayal is. Assuming it's accurate, my suggestion to all of us would be to keep our day jobs and don't go near Hollywood. In Hollywood, there are plenty of knives around, and there's a back waiting for every knife. Definitely not my kind of place.However, The Player is pretty much my kind of movie. It's certainly never boring, the acting is good, there's glamor everywhere, and Altman has opened a small window so that we can see how movies get made, or don't get made.We saw this film on DVD and it worked well on the small screen. If you're interested in what goes on in Hollywood--at least according to Altman--then this movie will work for you, as it did for me. Before you see the film, you might want to look at the IMDb cast list to see actors playing ""herself"" or ""himself."" Then, you'll recognize the actors when they show up in their cameos, and save yourself the frustration of saying, ""I know her, but what's her name?""",The Player

""The Player"" is a slowburning, yet suspenseful detective story, with funny breathers scattered throughout. Whoopi Goldberg swinging her tampon is one of those hilarious scenes that lights up the seriousness of this detective story about the death threats. It's a who dunnit, with some jokes and with lots of parodies on the inside world of Hollywood. Lots and I really mean lots and lots of actors play themselves in this movie.

The death threats get more serious every week and Tim Robbins gets desperate to find out which psychotic writer is sending these threats. ""The Player"" at first depicts the search for this mysterious person who is sending these evil death threats, but later on the movie takes a dramatic turn which I wont reveal here to avoid spoilers. As I said before, it is a slowburning story, yet slowly climaxing into a very suspenseful ending. Over 2 hours long. But I enjoyed every minute of it and I must have seen it over 10 times by now. Acting is not particularly great, yet rather funny, in a more amusing satirical way. It is especially funny to see all those well known actors (in the nineties) walk by in this movie playing themselves. That is just eye candy.

32,videorama-759-859391,Lets play,8,14 May 2015,"I came across this movie one night on t.v. I was glued to the screen for the rest of the movie. Then I watched the movie in it's entirety, three weeks later. Anyone who's in the film industry will identify with this, where a couple of actors plays themselves funnily enough, one being Burt Reynolds, who confronts someone who insulted him behind his back. I so relate with a lot of things in the movie, where this is pretty close to what goes on in this biz, where an interesting spin of story is what has you engrossed here. Cool and calm Robbins is a big Hollywood exec who's the butt of a failed scriptwriter's revenge, where Robbins passed on his script. God knows how many scripts he would of passed on, in this reality, where many of them meet their demise, going into a back burner. This party really wants to put the knife in Robbins, sending him death threats, and planting snakes in his four wheel drive. Pretty sure of the culprit (Vincent O'nofrio) Robbins confronts him, and I must say this was interesting to see how a exec like Robbins, tries to reason out the problems, he's having with this chafed and supposed/stalker party. But really, here I mean, like telling the rejected nutter why his script didn't cut it. Moments later, an act of manslaughter ensues, where Robbins, now must cover his tracks. He falls in love with the girlfriend (the always great Greta Schacci) of the victim, and of course is questioned by authorities as having been seen with the deceased. Like other Altman films, The Player comes off pretty cool, and is one of his most engrossing films, with again a stellar cast of actors who deliver, notably Robbins, but I particularly liked Richard E Grant, as someone trying to pitch a movie idea to Robbins. On the other side of the token, we can't forget Scacchi as well. You tend to forget the movie's a thriller, you're more into the story, but it could be over weighed by the fact it's more a story than a thriller, with an end you don't expect as far as Robbins is concerned where someone as you might say, again returns, having Robbins by the balls. 123 minutes breezes by in this very involving film, as one must stay to the end to see how Robbin's fate unfolds.",The Player
33,runamokprods,Near Perfect Satire,9,27 August 2016,"This is full of great moments, great shots, great humor. It's almost a truly great film. But the few moments it gets too smug and/or cartoony for it's own good take a tiny something away from the 90% of the time it brilliantly walks the thin, nearly impossible line of perfect satire. When it tries to be funny, it pushes a little hard. But when it just observes the absurdity of Hollywood with a clinical, 'this isn't too far from reality' eye, it's flat out amazing. Even with it's minor flaws, a terrific film, and a must see film for any Altman fan - or film fan for that matter. The opening shot alone is worth the movie!",The Player
34,mjneu59,Hollywood inside out,8,27 December 2010,"Most filmmakers would be reluctant to mock their own trade for fear of biting the hand that feeds them, so it needed an acknowledged outsider like Robert Altman to make one of the better Hollywood satires. Altman and writer Michael Tolkin take aim at the film industry with a battery of inside jokes and clever gestures, including the perhaps too clever novelty casting of several dozen movie stars portraying themselves in cameo (playing spot-the-celebrity can be a distraction, especially with scene stealers like Whoopi Goldberg and Dean Stockwell in fictional roles). Tolkin's story, adapted from his own novel about a paranoid studio executive driven to desperation by death threats from an anonymous screenwriter, is every hack's fantasy revenge against a system favoring glamour over talent. Altman in turn transforms what could have been a cynical grudge match into a tongue-in-cheek salute to the vanity, pretensions, and shallow charms of commercial movie-making, in which the actual films are only accessories to the real action of making deals.",The Player
35,FilmCriticLalitRao,One of American cinema's best director Robert Altman shows the true colors of Hollywood in 'The Player'.,10,20 June 2015,"Anybody who has anything to do with the creation of a major blockbuster finds a prominent place in 'The Player'. The ubiquitous art versus commercial distinction has not been ignored by director Robert Altman as there are numerous references about this dichotomy in his film. 'The Player' has all the right elements to attract viewers who like cinema either as a form of entertainment or as a form of art. It is with utter amazement one learns that even people in the business of making films speak of films citing examples of great films such as 'Touch of evil' etc. It is no surprise that the entire film is soaked in the colors of cinema with numerous posters of famous films adorn the walls. One of this film's strength lies in its having a gripping story which leaves no room for any kind of dull moment. This effect is achieved through jumping across genres throughout the film namely thriller, comedy and suspense. Director Robert Altman firmly ensures that his film 'The Player' works at many levels. Firstly, it gives viewers a very clear idea of how Hollywood works. One gets to see Hollywood cinema's big fishes hobnobbing at parties with other important people whose job is to break or make the career of these big people. Everybody has just one thing on mind-how to make a successful film which would earn a lot of money ? This sentiment is prominently echoed until the end of the film. Probably, this is one of the best reasons to watch this successful film.",The Player
36,Lechuguilla,Tinseltown Memoirs,9,18 October 2005,"Screen writing is a craft, one of many in Hollywood that builds or supports the towering edifice upon which our glamorous ""stars"" ... sit. Without a screenplay, actors, directors, and others in Hollywood might otherwise grovel for beans and potatoes at the local soup kitchen.And so, director Altman gives us ""The Player"", a film about a screen writing executive (well played by Tim Robbins) who listens to story ideas, and makes decisions about what you and I see, and don't see, at the local multiplex. For every idea that evolves into a film, billions and billions of other ideas wither and die, along with the careers of the writers who conceived those ideas. Inevitably, some of those writers get miffed, and that is the premise of ""The Player"".It's actually a weak premise, because in reality the business of screen writing is fairly bland, and the conflict, which exists mostly in people's heads, is fairly tame. To rev up the drama, and to qualify the film as a ""thriller"", the filmmakers here insert some contrived conflict, in the form of threatening postcards. If you watch this film for the ""thriller"" element only, you may be disappointed.This film works, not so much as a thriller, but rather as a classy, semi-inside peak into the back rooms of Hollywood decision making. There's lots of humor, some obvious, some subtle. And the film's plot is filled with satirical irony. In addition to Robbins' fine performance, Whoopi Goldberg is great as a tampon obsessed detective.The best approach to ""The Player"" is to absorb the Tinseltown setting, and watch the characters as they maneuver for selfish advantage. I really liked the inclusion of dozens of real-life Hollywood celebrities, just being themselves. You get to see them in their natural habitat. This element adds texture and authenticity, and thus helps to prop up the weak story.Although the contrived plot falters somewhat in the middle Act, it's the overall Tinseltown setting and real-life ambiance that make ""The Player"" an entertaining and insightful film.",The Player
37,smatysia,Grounded in the machinations of Hollywood,7,20 May 2015,"Among the comments I have read, it seems that people have strong opinions about this movie. They either love it or hate it. I thought that it was pretty good. It is a film with a separate plot, but grounded in the machinations of Hollywood. It seems to me that most of the cynicism expressed here has only gotten worse in the decades since. A film seems to need to be a sequel, a remake, or based on a comic book to get made these days. Anyway this movie's main character is played fairly well by the unlikeable, and vaguely creepy Tim Robbins. Nice job by Greta Scacchi, and also by Cynthia Stevenson, who I recall as playing a goody-goody character in a sitcom around that time, so her part was a nice departure. Again, it is a pretty good, albeit not great film.",The Player
38,a_baron,The Player,5,31 January 2020,"Is this a comedy, a drama, black comedy...? Some consider it satire, but although it is based in Hollywood, the basic plot could be transferred to any other jurisdiction, any other industry, or none. Our hero/anti-hero is receiving threatening missives from someone he has slighted, the question is, who? He thinks he has worked out the mystery man's identity, so goes to confront him. The prime suspect is unhinged and very likely the perp, but they come to blows in a dark street, and he ends up killing him. You know what happens next, another threatening message arrives. And although the death of the unfortunate innocent was passably manslaughter or at worst second degree murder, the police are investigating it as murder one, and he is clearly in the frame, even if at first they pretend he is simply a witness.There is a bit more to it than that, but not a lot. Read whatever you like into ""The Player"", but it is a quite unexceptional film.",The Player
39,slokes,Your Hollywood Is Dead!,8,22 April 2012,"Watching ""The Player"" after reading the Michael Tolkin novel was an edifying experience. Sometimes the book is better, less often the movie is. This time it's a strange kind of tie.Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is a Hollywood executive who has the hard job of saying no to a lot of people who want to see their scripts become movies. Unfortunately, some of these people play rough. One apparently sends him a number of threatening messages, reminding Mill of a meeting that never happened. Griffin thinks he knows who it is. And as it turns out, Griffin can play rough, too.Robert Altman was a quirky director, but this one time he plays it straight. Yes, you get a lot of overlapping dialogue, but there's one central story and not a lot of time spent on tangents. There's a big cast, alright, including over 60 cameos by recognizable movie talents. But this time the big cast is kept securely on the sidelines as Griffin must unravel the mystery of his secret antagonist, without becoming unraveled himself.""The Player"" the novel is a gripping, largely humorless study of a functional psychopath at play in the fields of Mammon. Here Tolkin the scripter gives us a relatively sympathetic protagonist. We are almost with him after the big climactic confrontation that sets the plot in motion, enough to root for him when he comes to the attention of the police. It doesn't quite work as well as it could, because Robbins seems a mite too decent for the turn his character takes, but he's a good actor in a good role and presents a worthy center for what becomes less mystery than satire.I like the satire, too, a lot. The opening eight minutes and 21 seconds are done in a single take, which provides some needed exposition but also some solid laughs. Buck Henry, co-writer of ""The Graduate,"" pitches a strange sequel where Ben and Elaine live with a stroke-impaired Mrs. Robinson.""Is this going to be funny?"" Griffin asks.""Yes, it'll be funny and dark and weird and funny with a stroke,"" Buck answers. ""Maybe it's not a stroke, maybe it's a malady of some sort.""As the book develops, we move farther from Hollywood and more deeply into the twisted psyche of Griffin. Here, Robbins plays the character as more of a survivor, and one senses Altman, for all his vitriol at the Dream Factory, is on his side.It's one of Altman's best looking films, with a strong Big '80s vibe even though the film was released in 1992. Though a noir film, it's largely shot in sunlight, like Altman's earlier noir film, ""The Long Goodbye."" This is a less slack film than that one, but in some ways less enjoyable, too. The strong focus pushes elements to the center that don't always work, like Griffin's romance with a strange Icelandic artist whom Greta Scacchi plays with cool detachment, or the police investigation which relies too much on the non-actor Lyle Lovett.Whoopi Goldberg is solid fun as the lead cop, however, and you get some great supporting work from Fred Ward as the head of studio security, Dean Stockwell as a hustling producer, and Richard E. Grant as an overly intense director (""Montana will end you!"" he warns Andie MacDowell, playing herself, because it did the same to Michael Cimino.)My favorite performer is Peter Gallagher, as a slick up-and-comer named Levy out for Griffin's job. Altman sets him up well as the commerce guy versus Griffin's belief in some artistic integrity. The irony is that Levy's a nicer guy, and a team player, but we cheer on the bad guy because he's better company. There are no nice guys, however, and the only person with integrity is seen literally knocked down for a cheap laugh. Altman wasn't a nice guy, either.The cameos are fun to spot (I just noticed Martin Mull for the first time, sitting at the table next to Angelica Huston) but a bit scattershot in terms of the larger story, which suffers a bit from lack of focus.What works best about the movie, I think, is the unique ending Tolkin gives it, which honors the conventions of a Hollywood ending while sending it up mercilessly. It's here Altman really lays on the acid, and gives his film bite. It goes down smooth, however, a warning wrapped around a Valentine to Hollywood's powers of playing with our heads.",The Player

41,ShootingShark,Dazzling Satirical Murder Thriller Set Among The Hollywood Hotshots,7,27 May 2007,"Griffin Mill is a cold-hearted hotshot movie studio executive who is receiving postcard death threats. He assumes it's from a writer he turned down, confronts him, and a heated argument leads to the writer's death. Now Griffin's a murder suspect, and guess what - he picked the wrong guy ...The Player is a fantastic dark thriller which works extremely well, both as a character study of a unlikely killer, and as an exposé on Hollywood's practices - story pitches, schmoozing rich investors, audience preview testing and the like. The great thing about Michael Tolkin's script (he plays one of the two goofy brothers trying to cut a deal) is whether or not you relate to Griffin. Do you think he's a scumbag who deserves to get caught, because that is what he is. Or do you find yourself worrying for him, as the tension racks up on all sides, despite the fact that he's a jerk and we know he's guilty. Robbins doesn't make him sympathetic but he does make him intelligent and cultured, so there's always a duality to the character. The sad legacy of this movie of course is that when it came out only an asshole would wear Raybans, drive a Range Rover and talk on a cell-phone all the time, whereas nowadays that's what everyone aspires to. Griffin not only winds up tops in the movie, but everybody wants to be like him. The rest of the cast are varied - Scacchi is boring and Goldberg is ludicrously over the top (playing the one character who's supposed to be realistic), but Stevenson, Ward and D'Onofrio are great. The movie's trump card of course is its astonishing extras cast of sixty-five actors playing themselves (which beats even the forty-three in Around The World In Eighty Days), ranging from huge stars (Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis) to old codgers (Jack Lemmon, Rod Steiger) to cult icons (Malcolm McDowell, Louise Fletcher), presumably all pals of the much-admired Altman. This serves to make it seem both real and fantasy at the time, which is a tone the movie nails spot-on and gels with the happy-but-awful ending it satirises so well. There's also a weird, brilliant score by the prolific Thomas Newman, all bells, percussion and double-bass. I was a bit amazed when Altman made this, since it's a world away from his usual insightful but interminably plodding multi-character dramas, and technically it's superb - it even has a stunning eight-minute opening shot which approaches the work of peerless craftsmen like Brian DePalma or Quentin Tarantino. This movie was funded independently by TV mogul Aaron Spelling, since obviously no major studio would touch it, and was intriguingly snubbed at the Oscars, despite doing good box-office and winning lots of other prestigious awards. I guess Hollywood didn't like what it had to say, which is reason enough to see it.",The Player
42,Spleen,"62 cameos is 59 too many in a good film, 50 too many in this film",3,21 January 2002,"Read at your own risk: there's a mild spoiler buried in my comments somewhere.  Not that it matters.Films about Hollywood are stinkers, everyone knows that.  But people who should know better think that this one must be an exception.  It's made by a director who is, no doubt, talented - his skilled handling of actors and camera is everywhere apparent - but the film is empty rubbish; there's no getting around it.Look at the few Hollywood films about Hollywood that AREN'T empt rubbish and one can immediately sense the difference.  ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Barton Fink"" and ""Ed Wood"" ... although, by rights, they OUGHT to be standard examples of Hollywood navel-gazing, somehow they spring to life.  (""Singin' in the Rain"" was one of the very best films of the 1950s; ""Barton Fink"", of the 1990s.)  What have they got that ""The Player"" doesn't?Interesting things to say about their subject matter, for one thing ... but actually, the main difference from which all others stem is that ""The Player"" has something they don't: self-reference.  ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Ed Wood"" and ""Barton Fink"" keep themselves free of this intoxicating (for artists, not for audiences) drug partly by setting the action 24, 36 and c.55 years in the past, respectively; Wilder doesn't do this with ""Sunset Boulevard"", yet he adroitly manages to avoid all the nasty traps into which Altman doesn't so much fall as joyfully leap.  Altman is keen to remind us - as often and as tediously as possible - that we are WATCHING A MOVIE that was produced under THESE VERY CONDITIONS.  (In fact, one of the films that gets greenlighted in the course of the story turns out to be ""The Player"" itself!  I don't actually object to this kind of twist, and sometimes I enjoy it, but I'd realised that it was neither interesting nor novel before I turned ten.)  No doubt Altman feels this frees him of the responsibility of making the characters worthy of our attention, or of telling us anything about the production of films that might illuminate our understanding of them, or the people that make them, or anything else.One of the ways Altman keeps nudging us in the ribs is with cameos ... hundreds and hundreds of cameos.  Well, not quite that many, but still more than enough to get him a place in ""The Guinness Book of Records"", which was doubtless his intention.  There are in fact 62 actors and actresses who play themselves, as well as 35 who don't, and if you can keep the two classes mentally separate without watching the film a dozen or so times first, perhaps Altman will be kind enough to give you a prize.  And who COULD watch this film a dozen times?  It was kind of fun the first time, I'll admit, but never again.Still, I'm more than willing to sit down and try some other Altman films. So far as I know, they're about other topics - war in Korea, the fashion industry, country music, life in Los Angeles, etc. - which might allow the craft on display here to be turned to good account.",The Player
43,aimless-46,For Viewers Who Like to Be Challenged,9,23 October 2006,"""The Player"" could be considered Altman's ""Big Lebowski"" in that it withholds much of its pleasure from the first viewing and then begins to grow on you after you have seen it a couple times. This is because it is basically a huge inside joke on mainstream Hollywood film-making, with too many obscure references for a Hollywood outsider to effectively process the first time around. Also like ""The Big Lebowski, the satire and sardonic wit is packaged around what appears to be a crime drama, with the straight drama itself engaging enough to entertain most viewers the first time around.Tim Robbins plays Griffin Mill, a high level studio executive whose job is listening to the countless pitches that come his way from aspiring writers wanting to get their screen play into production. The studio only produces a dozen features a year so Griffin mostly hands out rejections. He has made at least one major enemy during the process, an unknown writer who begins sending him threatening postcards. Griffin thinks he has a line on the identity of his enemy, an unpublished writer named David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio-Private Pyle in ""Full Metal Jacket) who lives in the valley with his artist girlfriend (Greta Scacchi). But their confrontation goes bad and Griffin accidentally kills him. Things get worse for Griffin; he becomes the main suspect for the murder, he gets a post-murder postcard revealing that he murdered the wrong guy, and he is in danger of being replaced by a newly hired hotshot Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher). ""The Player"" is most famous for an eight-minute tracking shot at the very beginning of the film, self-reflexively compared to Hitchcock's ""Rope"" and to Welles' ""Touch of Evil""; and full of Altman's trademark overlapping dialogue. Also notable are the 50 or so actors who make cameo appearances throughout the feature; most just play themselves (it is after all set in Hollywood) and it is entertaining just trying to identify everyone. The DVD has a commentary by Altman and writer Michael Tolkin. Unfortunately Altman's film-making style does not lend itself to organized reflection so he mostly just rambles on about everything but the film; and Tolkin has major issues with the whole Hollywood scene so his commentary is just a continuous rant and whine about the system. It is important to remember that Altman is essentially a Hollywood black sheep who has been at war with Hollywood his whole career. The Hollywood establishment is uncomfortable with him because he won't make their standard pre-sold product and yet he manages to crank out enough commercial successes on his own terms to keep them off balance. ""The Player"" is kind of his revenge picture, he knew that its production would cause a wave of paranoia to sweep the industry and he made paranoia the defining characteristic of the film. He views Hollywood as a marketing machine that both drives and is driven by the lowest common denominator of audience demographics. During the opening tracking shot look for Griffin's meeting with Buck Henry, who pitches a sequel to ""The Graduate"" (Elaine and Benjamin have a daughter and he suggests ""The Postgraduate"" for the sequel's title). Henry improvised this pitch which is funnier with each viewing, and appropriately also had a cameo in ""The Graduate"". These film allusions are everywhere as Hollywood's past seems to be passing judgment on its pathetic present. Watch for the bungled meeting at the hotel, the scene ends with the camera centered on a picture of Hitchcock on the hotel wall-a shot of about the same duration as a typical Hitchcock cameo (in his own films). For sheer comedy watch for Griffin's visit to police headquarters where the Pasadena detective (Whoopi Goldberg), interviews him in the busy squad room. Another detective (Lyle Lovett) is a movie buff who keeps chanting ""One of us! One of us!"" from ""Freaks"". Griffin plots to derail the threat inside the studio by setting up Levy with a script pitched by self-styled auteur Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant). It's a Susan Hayward vehicle with the heroine going to the gas chamber because ""it's reality, and that's what happens."" Oakley wants real which means no stars and a non-Hollywood ending. Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis are mentioned as exactly the type of casting Oakley does not want; which foreshadows his pending commercial corruption and artistic compromise. This is a film that is meant to be watched closely (the beginning tracking shot is Altman's way of getting our attention and warning us that we will need to pay attention). Audience involvement is very important to him and he is counting on a motivated audience who brings considerable prior knowledge to the viewing. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",The Player

45,valadas,Life can be a movie,7,5 September 2008,"The veteran Robert Altman gives us a movie made with his usual firm hand in what concerns cast direction, cut, dialogues and the story itself. No flaws are found except perhaps the dialogue in the very end between the studio executive and a screenplay writer which reveals the real meaning of the whole story and makes movies and real life seem similar but looks like a bit artificial or affected. This is the story of a studio executive who half involuntarily and almost accidentally kills a screenplay writer whom he thinks is threatening him for not having accepted a screenplay he was offering to be bought by the executive's studio. Since he is not discovered discreet blackmail and disguised threatens ensue, from someone whose identity he ignores. The story is well told and the opportunity is seized to show the intrigues and dirty games that take place behind the scenes in the motion pictures business. It's deepened by a love relation that meanwhile springs between the studio executive and the dead screenplay writer's girlfriend after they meet at the latter's funeral. This underplot love story is authentic and very human and confers the movie a sentimental feature which tempers its apparent coldness. There is also the psychological drama lived by the studio executive after the murdering which he can conceal in his reactions but we surmise in the scenes with his new girlfriend mainly when he goes to see her after discovering a snake in his car which was put there by the blackmailer. The most important lesson to draw from this movie is that life can be a movie after all and that fiction and reality can be confounded sometimes.",The Player
46,DeeNine-2,Joe Gillis calling...,10,21 August 2001,"""Players only love you when they're playing."" --Stevie NicksGriffin Mill, whose name has a kind of ersatz Hollywood feel to it (cf., D. W. Griffith/Cecil B. De Mille), is not a player with hearts so much as a player with dreams. He is a young and powerful film exec who hears thousands of movie pitches a year, but can only buy twelve. So he must do a lot of dissembling, not to mention outright lying, along with saying ""We'll get back to you,"" etc. This is what he especially must say to writers. And sometimes they hold a grudge. In this case one of the rejected writers begins to stalk Griffin Mill and send him threatening postcards. And so the plot begins.Tim Robbins, in a creative tour de force, plays Griffin Mill with such a delightful, ironic charm that we cannot help but identify with him even as he violates several layers of human trust. The script by Michael Tolkin smoothly combines the best elements of a thriller with a kind of Terry Southern satirical intent that keeps us totally engrossed throughout. The direction by Robert Altman is full of inside Hollywood jokes and remembrances, including cameos by dozens of Hollywood stars, some of whom get to say nasty things about producers. The scenes are well-planned and then infused with witty asides. The tampon scene at police headquarters with Whoopi Goldberg is an hilarious case in point, while the sequence of scenes from Greta Scacchi's character's house to the manslaughter scene outside the Pasadena Rialto, is wonderfully conceived and nicely cut. Also memorable is the all black and white dress dinner scene in which Cher is the only person in red, a kind of mean or silly joke, depending on your perspective. During the same scene Mill gives a little speech in which he avers that ""movies are art,"" a statement that amounts to sardonic irony since, as a greedy producer, he cares nothing at all about art, but only about box office success. His words also form a kind of dramatic irony when one realizes that this movie itself really is a work of art. As Altman observes in a trailing clip, the movie ""becomes itself."" The Machiavellian ending illustrates this with an almost miraculous dovetailing. This is the kind of script that turns most screen writers Kermit-green with envy.Incidentally, Joe Gillis, the Hollywood writer played by William Holden in Sunset Boulevard--personifying all unsuccessful screen writers--actually does call during the movie, but Mill doesn't recognize the name and has to be told he is being put on, further revealing the narrow confines of his character.In short, this is a wonderfully clever, diabolically cynical satire of Hollywood and the movie industry. This is one of those movies that, if you care anything at all about film, you must see. Period. It is especially delicious if you hate Hollywood. It is also one of the best movies ever made about Hollywood, to be ranked up there with A Star is Born (1937) (Janet Gaynor, Fredric March); Sunset Boulevard (1950); A Star is Born (1954) (Judy Garland, James Mason); and Postcards from the Edge (1990).I must add that in the annals of film, this has to go down as one of the best Hollywood movies not to win a single Academy Award, although it was nominated for three: Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing. I suspect the Academy felt that the satire hit a little too close to home for comfort.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

47,pyrocitor,A quirky and self aware inside look at the film industry,9,12 June 2007,"It seems self explanatory to say that over the years, many movies have been made detailing the inside workings of the film industry, and it stands to reason - after all, what better subject matter for Hollywood to portray through a film than the industry which makes the films itself? However, the far more common approach for such films is one which glorifies Hollywood, celebrating the business which brings magic into the minds and hearts of millions of people every day. Far less common are films like Robert Altman's The Player - films which dare to show the inner workings of the movie industry without the shiny, day glow exterior, and expose some of the darker and grittier aspects of the industry, while still maintaining a quietly satirical touch. Director Robert Altman cunningly paints his film with a very realistic, almost documentary feel, as if as well as following the plot the viewer is also watching a behind the scenes feature on Hollywood producers. But at the same time, the film itself proves to be essentially an immense inside joke in the sense that it pokes fun at certain conventions of Hollywood films, but at the same time works them into the plot itself, in a smarmy, mocking fashion. (note a gratuitous sex scene, a disturbingly happy ending, even an almost contrived feeling mystery element complete with occasional violent bits) The script, by Michael Tolkin, is quick, clever and unflinching, and is without a question what really makes the film most worth watching, as well as the simply brilliant editing and cinematography (filming a sex scene only showing extreme close-ups on the actors' faces was a particularly garish touch which suited the tone of the film exquisitely) which perfectly capture the film in a fresh and innovative fashion. Rather than launching a huge smear campaign against the monstrosities and immense luxuries of the movie industry (it would be interesting to see how such a movie, one which attempts to tear down the industry producing it, would be marketed...) Altman is content to nudge gently rather than shove angrily. The film is subtle in its criticisms of the Hollywood way of life, but still makes its points abundantly clear, without shoving its ideology into the audience's face. This ""show rather than tell"" narrative structure proves far more effective, as the audience is free to come to their own conclusions regarding the ethics of the movies, rather than having a viewpoint shoved down their throat in an abrasive fashion. Altman is also insightful enough to add a quietly comic touch to the film; while the film does serve as a commentary on the movie industry, it maintains an ever so subtle satirical touch, making it difficult to decide if the movie is meant to be more of a cynical exposé or a black comedy. It seems most likely that the result is somewhere in between the two, and either way a refreshingly different take on storytelling - which is ironic, given the film pokes fun at the static creativity in Hollywood. Tim Robbins is a perfect piece of casting as Griffin Mill, the slimy, Machiavellian Hollywood producer. Robbins exudes a laid back, almost reptilian charm which perfectly compliments his character - although Mill is essentially a despicable character who commits unethical action after unethical action, always getting away with it, we can't help but still be taken in by him. Greta Scacchi is a bizarre but beguiling presence as the mysterious painter who drifts into Mill's life, and Peter Gallagher is a perfect fit for the part of a naive Hollywood super agent. Whoopi Goldberg is an unquestionably odd choice for the role of an eccentric detective, yet the role fits the quirky tone of the film well. Vincent D'Onofrio shines in his brief role as obsessive screenwriter David Kahane, and Sydney Pollack contributes a wonderful little role as Mill's lawyer. It is also impossible to refer to this film without mentioning the immense quantity of lovingly tongue in cheek celebrity cameos, (John Cusack, Jeff Goldblum, Malcolm McDowell, Burt Reynolds, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, whose appearance near the end of the film, a scathing stab at the stereotypical action film is arguably the film's most enjoyable moment) and it really shows Altman's directorial clout that so many stars were willing to come in and poke fun at their industry, almost unanimously for free. Their presence not only strengthens the believability of the plot itself, but also re-enforces that the points Altman is attempting to make in regards to his industry are not altogether unfounded, or such vast quantities of celebrities would not be so openly supporting his film. All things considered, The Player is a fresh take on the increasingly common topic of show business, but it's Altman's cinematic voice, and Tolkin's crackling script, underhanded but twinkling with quiet wit, which really makes the film worthwhile. Robbins perfectly convinces in his part, the greasy soul of the film, and his casting is enough to carry the occasional plot misfires which do arise from time to time. On retrospect, the entire gist of the film can be summed up in a single scene, where Griffin Mill goes to an independent art theater in search of writer David Kahane and ends up watching the end of The Bicycle Thief, an old Italian classic. Mill's response to the film, an attempt to win over the favour of scorned writer Kahane is by saying ""That was a good movie, I should do a remake of it"". Easily worth seeing!-9/10",The Player

After several sweeps in & out we focus on studio exec Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) who has just received the latest in a series of postcard threats from some hack writer whose film idea he never got back to the writer on. He also feels threatened by a younger hotshot the studio head just hired as a possible replacement for himself- Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher).

49,seymourblack-1,"Witty, Cynical & Brilliantly Written",9,12 August 2015,"The highly impressive opening sequence of this movie launches its audience straight into a Hollywood environment in which people talk about pitches, tracking shots and editing styles as well as indulging in gossip. This is visually interesting because of its long tracking shot and the ways in which various groups of people move around each other. More significantly though, it provides an immediate taste of what the movie's about, as it depicts people whose preoccupations are entirely industry-based. Their focus is on making deals and pitches that are promoted on the basis of how similar they are to other movies that have previously been successful or how suitable certain roles in the script could be for already-established top stars. This is an insular business that pays lip-service to artistic aspirations but is, in reality, only concerned about commercial success.Director Robert Altman uses satire and humour extensively to highlight the superficiality and absurdity of certain aspects of Hollywood life but also by using a plot that features murder, romance and plenty of laughs, makes ""The Player"" extremely enjoyable. Predictably, a number of Altman trademarks such as a large cast, interesting use of zoom lenses and overlapping dialogue are all featured as well as a staggering number of well-known stars who appear in cameo roles.Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is a Hollywood studio executive who spends his days listening to screenwriters' pitches for new movies. He's well paid, smartly dressed and involved in a relationship with his talented assistant Bonnie (Cynthia Stevenson). Things start to become uncomfortable for him when he starts to receive postcards containing death threats and hears rumours that his job could be under threat because the studio have recently hired Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher), who's a younger, extremely ambitious executive with previous experience of the same kind of work at Fox.Mill presumes that the postcards must be the work of a screenwriter whose ideas he's rejected and after carrying out some checks of his records, comes to the conclusion that a man called David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio) is probably responsible. After locating Kahane in Pasadena, he tries to convince him that he's interested in one of his screenplays. Kahane is sceptical, unpleasant and argumentative and starts a fight with Mill which ends with Kahane lying dead in a car park. Mill tries to make it appear that Kahane had been the victim of a robbery and promptly makes his getaway.Disturbingly, after Kahane's death, the threatening postcards keep arriving, Mill becomes the prime suspect for his murder and Bonnie gets dumped after Mill starts an affair with Kahane's girlfriend June (Greta Scacchi). Mill then starts to recover from his problems when he seizes an opportunity to nullify the threat that Levy poses and also gets himself off-the-hook for the murder charge in the most unpredictable circumstances that pave the way for a conclusion that's outrageously funny.One of the many movies referenced in ""The Player"" is ""Bicycle Thieves"" (aka ""The Bicycle Thief"") and just as Vittorio De Sica had used non-professionals as extras to enhance the authenticity of his 1948 Italian neorealist masterpiece, so Altman uses top-class professionals in his movie for exactly the same purpose.With its terrific cast, wonderful performances and brilliant script, ""The Player"" is a great movie that's inherently cynical but never heavy-handed and thanks to its marvellous humour, remains extremely entertaining throughout.",The Player
50,bobsgrock,A vivid picture of the movie system.,10,12 July 2010,"Robert Altman was at the end of his rope in 1991 when Michael Tolkin came to him with a screenplay based on his own novel that would eventually become the incredibly smart, edgy black comedy about the movie business, The Player. Seeing an opportunity to take a little revenge on the snob types that had ridiculed and hampered him for most of the 1980s, Altman took the project, which today must be recognized as a classic Altmanesque movie; one of his very best.The film opens with an 8 minute tracking shot, going over various writers, producers and executives as they go about the business of deciding which ideas are best to be produced into movies. Typical of Altman, we only get bits and pieces of conversations that seem to have started before and end after the camera captures them. We hear about a possible sequel to The Graduate as well as other hopefully unsuccessful projects, all mentioned strictly because there is a notion in someone's head that it might be successful in terms of money.Altman is very careful in his satire here, using these high-ranking individuals as the foundation for all that is wrong with the movies today, yet never makes it seem that he is pointing at one specific individual. There are numerous story lines going on here, also typical of Altman, and though sometimes they overflow with one another, the film mainly follows the actions of Griffin Mill, a producer with threats of losing his job and being killed by a writer he refused to listen to about his pitch. He then uses these personal troubles to fight back to the people trying to sweep him under the rug by using their own game against them.It is somewhat difficult to describe all that goes on in this film, which I will say again is very smart and wickedly pointed about the movie industry. Altman's fame in the 1970s helped him attract numerous stars for cameos in this film and that adds even more poignancy and realism to the story. Tim Robbins is excellent as Mill and we watch him with an an endless fascination, wondering what he will do next. Certainly one of Altman's best films, along with MASH, Nashville and 3 Women and one of the best movies about movies ever made.",The Player
51,mstomaso,Insidiously clever dark comedy,9,13 November 2005,"Robert Altman gets under my skin. His films are worthy of great respect, yet they are frequently as irritating as they are brilliant. The Player is, as much as Short Cuts, a quintessential Altman film. It is also one of the best roles Tim Robbins has ever enjoyed.This film is about Hollywood's dark underbelly. The Player eviscerates its subject by twisting justice, political gamesmanship and artistic integrity into new configurations. For non-film-buffs or non-professionals some of the humor may seem too subtle to notice. To film buffs and insiders, the humor is totally over the top.Robbins plays a young studio exec who is playing the game to win and seems, at least part of the time, to have a conscience. Everything is going along fine for him until he starts receiving threatening calls and letters from a writer whose screenplays he has rejected, and an arch-rival is promoted to a position just above his own. Paranoia and real danger seem in the periphery of every scene in his life, as the make-believe of his industry and the reality of his life begin to blend freely.Robbins makes a character who could easily have been totally unlikeable somehow sympathetic. Despite his amazing performance, liking the character makes you feel as if you should go stand in a shower and exfoliate for an hour or so. He is supported by excellent supporting work all around. Especially good are the two major women's roles - played by Greta Scachi and Bonnie Sherrow, and veteran camp character Dean Stockwell.The photography is liberally and amusingly lifted from several classic thrillers, mysteries and dramas, and comes off fresh and original - not at all like a DePalmaesque bit of visual plagiarism. And the pace is brisk.The Player is probably my favorite Altman film, and it is easily my favorite Tim Robbins film. It's entertaining, intelligent and, well, it has a bad attitude. See it some night when you're angry and you need a good dark laugh.",The Player
52,blott2319-1,Only somewhat better than typical Altman,5,18 September 2021,"Robert Altman makes movies in a way that I generally despise. His devotion to improvised and overlapping dialogue is easily one of my biggest pet peeves from a director. There's a reason that screenwriters exist, and that most actors don't become screenwriters. The two jobs are completely different and when an actor is essentially asked to ""write"" dialogue off the top of their head, they just start babbling nonsense. There were definitely scenes in The Player that were blatant improv, and they were painful to watch. You can feel the actors searching for something interesting to say, but none of them find it. Not only that, but they talk over each other in these scenes in a way that normal people would never communicate. It was annoying enough that I actually covered my ears in one scene to block out the meaningless chatter.That being said, The Player might be one of Altman's most scripted films. There is a cohesive plot with a standard progression that I could follow from beginning to end. I also liked that Tim Robbins filled the role of the protagonist because he can thread the needle and come across as charming in certain scenes and then despicable in others. I had very conflicted emotions about his character, and I think that is intentional. But the sad part is that his character, in the long run, isn't all that sympathetic. I was interested in what was going to happen to him, but I would never say I was rooting for him. The Player gets pretty meta, and I am still undecided on whether I liked that or not. I appreciate what the writers are trying to do with the story, and I enjoyed the mystery, but the ending didn't feel as satisfying as I was hoping it might. I can't say that The Player was as frustrating and unpleasant as I've found other Altman films, but I also can't say I liked it.",The Player
53,classicalsteve,Suspense Black-Comedy Drama Exposes the Melodrama of the Entertainment Industry,10,16 May 2021,"""The Player"" directed by Robert Altman and starring Tim Robbins is probably the most scathing exposé of Hollywood culture since ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950). The entire film has a plethora of Hollywood cameos from Burt Reynolds to Cher to Andie MacDowell playing themselves to Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts starring in a Hollywood film. In addition there are all kinds of in-jokes, such as Cher, who often refuses to wear red in real life, shows up in a red dress at a Hollywood social function. The opening scene is a long uninterrupted continuous shot, and one of the people at the studio describes a film as having too many cuts. Another cameo involves a real-life screenwriter who had been pitching movie ideas to the studios for years but never having gotten one of his projects green-lighted.But behind the veneer of the movie stars and in-jokes is an intense and dark satire of what it means to be a VIP in the Hollywood entertainment industry; in short to be a ""player"". Tim Robbins in one of his best roles plays Griffin Mill, a Hollywood movie executive in a nameless film production studio. One of his tasks is to hear the thousands of film pitches of which only a handful will actually see fruition, i.e. Obtain studio backing. In Hollywood lingo, a ""pitch"" is a succinct verbal description concerning a hypothetical film project, often made by a screenwriter, actor, or someone representing the hypothetical project. Most pitches are no more than about five minutes. Often, the best pitches sum up the plot in a sentence: ""Expatriate meets long lost lover"": ""Casablanca"".Mill has it all: a wonderful executive position, a kind girlfriend working for the same studio, and access to all the elites of Hollywood entertainment. However, all is not well. He's been receiving death-threats via postcards, apparently from a disgruntled writer. Mill thinks he knows who's sending the poison pen letters, David Kahane, a writer who pitched him an idea about a young student who lives in Japan for a year. He learns from the writer's current girlfriend that her boyfriend is at an art movie house where the classic foreign film ""The Bicycle Thief"" is showing. Mill goes there to confront the writer and possibly offer him a film deal, but not all goes as planned, and he also learns Kahane was not the one sending him the postcards.As a subplot, a British screenwriter, Tom Oakley (Richard Grant) pitches a film about American injustice in which a wrongfully convicted white woman is sentenced to the gas chamber. What's fun about this subplot is that it shows, more or less, a bit about how films get green-lighted long before they are actually produced. We actually see the final scene of the ""film"" at the very end with two big name movie stars. At the end of ""The Player"" one the characters is actually metaphorically ""executed"".A brilliant film from beginning to end with Altman's famous overlapping dialogue. He also allowed those actors playing themselves to improvise their own lines. Reynolds offers a rather curt and memorable response upon meeting Mill. Not to be missed, especially for those who have more than a cursory interesting in film.",The Player
54,tim-764-291856,We're All Players,9,23 November 2010,"Famously opening with possibly the longest continuous single crane shot (eight minutes) with the pre-credits rolling, shot outside a major studio and its parking lot and known as the ultimate anti-Hollywood 'Hollywood' movie, this is Altman directing with a grip of iron. Almost over-directed for my taste, the camera swoops, rises and peeks at more A-listers than you'd get in two dozen blockbusters.Not having seen it in four years but with many many other films under my belt, I was keen to re-hear both the subtle and unsubtle jokes and jibes about the Studio 'scene'. All our A-listers make them, suffer them or just hang about thinking them up. One of the best has to be (executive travelling in his Merc convertible, on car-phone; it's the end 80's, start of 90's, all flash cars) talking to his associate, Tim Robbins (lead actor in this) ""I'm on my way to my AA meeting."" ""Oh...I didn't know you had a drinking problem"" ""Ah, well. I haven't. I don't. It's just that's where all the deals are made these days. Not bars"".So, not a comedy, as such, but entertaining stuff and the ending is as predictably anti-predictable that one can predict. It's aged well and Short Cuts aside, which meanders over its three hours, this is modern, witty, well made and concise. Yes; an Altman film that doesn't have the cast speaking whenever they feel fit and a script that they have to follow, even at two hours it's got a manageable story that twists, turns and bristles with actors you've seen in almost similar roles. For movie buffs, the often, occasional credibility-busting film references and how they're strung together is almost hypnotic.Hollywood loved it, as it's in it and stars in it. But they don't love themselves, at least not it this. And that makes it enjoyable. As it can't be taken as seriously as it mockingly thinks it is/isn't and thus a little shallow, I give it the same as the amount in minutes the intro is. Plus a half point.",The Player

One is reminded of ""Nashville"" where he turned his sights on the country music industry and politics. Now his victim is the industry in which he toils.  Altman provides a multi-layered view of the film industry from the point of view of the executives that run it, particularly those that have the responsibility for approving movie projects. If Altman is accurate, they are a cold, bloodless, bunch, capable of anything to get movie viewers into their seats.   Altman is aided by a great ensemble cast (isn't he always?) and delivers the goods. ""The Player"" is one of his best and is highly recommended for an enjoyable Saturday night rental.",The Player
56,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An incredibly meta examination of the Hollywood formula.,8,7 February 2020,"Those who are aware of Robert Altman's other films are sure to recognize the themes that permeated his oeuvre. He always seemed to find a way to satirize something in a way that underscored how broken the system is. From the military in M*A*S*H (1970) to the music industry in Nashville (1975), Altman had a keen eye to bring the ridiculous nature of these anthropological machines into the spotlight. Clearly, his time in the movie industry helped him adapt Michael Tolkin's novel into The Player (1992). In a weird and meta way, nothing has changed since its early-90's release.If you're playing the ""6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" game at home, this film is literally a ""who's who"" of actors and movie personalities (many of whom appear ""as themselves""). Unfortunately, this film does suffer from its early-90's aesthetic, often highlighting how far we've come in terms of fashion and technology in nearly three decades. Weirdly enough, though, many of the pitches for movies given in this film are exactly how I imagine these kinds of projects get made, even today. There's almost a timeless quality to how Hollywood works, and it's on full display here.Of course, the satire here is that Hollywood is an industry. Films will often start as good ideas, but are crammed into the mold of the ""successful"" formula to ensure the studio gets the most bang for its buck. Initially, I felt that The Player was a so-so story with an almost absurd murder mystery running alongside the usual Hollywood hustle and bustle. Then I got to the end. It's stunning how a movie about making movies by cramming them into boxes for maximum audience returns also seems to abide by these same rules, thus making it look much more ""woke"" when the twist at the end hits.An incredibly meta examination of the Hollywood formula, I give The Player 4.0 stars out of 5.",The Player

It kept me interested throughout the entire film and always had me entertained and even curious and guessing during the movie of what would happen next. The film also has some witty and sharp dialog and is a very sharp, well written and put together film.

It hovers on the cusp of Altman ""being Altman""--which is to say, being a tad indulgent--and Altman conduiting a really great storyline. So it appeals to the side of me that loves character, quirkiness, and color, and also the part of me that still expects good narrative from a movie.The ending, which I won't give away (don't worry), still makes me angry, as well as introspective. I first give way to a kind of victim mentality; externalizing the entrenched problem of big cinema's tendency to abuse the power of images to get the culpable off the hook. But then I realize that the solution is within each of us. All of us are culpable, and the real work of overcoming the systemic problem so beautifully encapsulated by the ending of The Player is work that each of us must do within our own hearts.What more can you expect from a movie? I could say many other things about The Player, but I'll cut it short.

In this case, the larger framework is the movie industry itself and with a number of famous movie stars appearing briefly as themselves, Altman gives Hollywood an hysterical going over. The plot in the foreground -- starring Tim Robbins, Greta Scacchi, Whoopie Goldberg, Lyle Lovett and others -- isn't especially engrossing; it is a somewhat routine story of murder and the pursuit of the murderer. The hilarity of the film takes place off to the side so to speak -- snatches of overheard conversations, plus the plotting and execution of a film that is intended initially to be a starless vehicle ending in the execution of an innocent woman and eventually becomes a movie starring Julia Roberts as the innocent woman and Bruce Willis as the district attorney who smashes the window of the execution chamber to rescue her after the gas pellets have already been dropped.

However he starts getting bugged by a dissatisfied writer which leads to all kinds of  deadly intrigue.Just when I thought Altman had gone totally off-the-boil he suddenly jumps back with his most perfectly realised film. While hardly unapplauded on its release (and in short retrospect) this is a movie that will be regarded by future generations as a classic. It is so smart, sassy, funny and has a beginning, a middle and an end. The kind of tragicomedy that gets the best of both worlds.Robbins is perfect as the lead. He doesn't do much or emote much. As Robert De Niro once said ""most people don't show their emotions, they hide them."" Occasionally we get behind the shield of human indifference, but only occasionally. We don't like him much - nor should we - but he is not so bad that we can't bare him. Indeed he is merely someone whose selfish world gets out of control. Whoopie Goldberg makes the most of her unlikely casting too.The appearance of stars in guest parts adds a bit of icing, but that is all. I loved Altman's directions to the stars who had to play walk-ons (who else could have got that?) ""remember, you are responsible for who you are on screen. You are playing yourselves!""The sexy Scacchi plays the love interest with great skill. While just a muse she is a far better actress than most and this shows in her short screen time. Shame she hasn't more involvement in the main plot.Like breaking a car down in to its competent parts, taking The Player apart only leaves an ugly mess of oil and metal. Together it drives a tight little film that has insight, drama and comedy. I would hesitate to call this a masterpiece, but it is a mini-masterpiece that however farfetched never reaches the point of being totally unbelievable.The pay off at the end is one of the best belly-laughs any film buff could ever get.

The chemistry between the two main characters is cranky at best - and I won't even try to compare to classic poisonous noir couples. Then the plot doesn't really move forward, and when you get used to it and understand it's more about a big inside joke than about a plot, you find it really drags its feet.Could have been an acceptable joke at 90 minutes max.

Watching the various emotions play across Tim Robbins face makes you understand what a great actor he is.The convoluted plot makes the movie more interesting, even as we see a Palm Springs lovers' rendezvous where some lovers swim in the nude in front of others dancing. You don't know what's true and what's not, even when the producer's ex-girlfriend is left sobbing on the steps. It seems too melodramatic for reality, but melodrama is what these people are all about!!!!! Altman's favorite trick of having everybody talk over each other is, while realistic, disconcerting. I still wish I could have heard what Burt Reynolds was saying, nothing complimentary, when Robbins walked up to him at the restaurant. Watching the writers become sycophants, prostituting their 'art' just to get the movie made rang QUITE true. He backs down on both 'no stars' and 'no Hollywood ending'.

It never decides what it wants to be, so it decides to be everything, and it just doesn't work.

Robert Altman's The Player, coming from the writing of Michael Tolkin, is a biting satire of Hollywood executives and the movie-making industry that is quick, sharp and wildly energetic. Tim Robbins plays Griffin Mill, a studio executive who is plagued by threatening postcards from a scorned writer all while he tries to traverse the daily life of a man in his job, listening to pitches and rubbing elbows with the Hollywood elite.In classic Altman fashion, Griffin's tale feels epic in scope and is an expert blend of sharp comedy and emotional drama. Robbins goes through an emotional gauntlet as Mill and it's impressive to watch him transform from the stoic and detached man we meet at the beginning to the disheveled wreck he eventually becomes. This is the classic character who thinks he's on top of the world and has to have some dark things happen in order to knock him back down, eventually going to places I wasn't expecting at all.The Player plays out like a great old epic, but the thing that makes it shine brightest is it's intelligence. Every so often we get these films that try to show us the ""life of making movies"", give us the behind the scenes comedy of it all, and 95% of the time they fall flat on their faces. Here though everything feels so energetic, with pop culture references galore and cameos enough to make any film fan delight at seeing all the familiar faces pop up. I swear it seemed like every five minutes I was sitting up and shouting the name of yet another one of my favorite actors who showed up in the background.All of the cameos are great, but the front-and-center cast is quite solid themselves, particularly Robbins who I don't think has ever been better. Altman's The Player is a brilliant satire, an absorbing thriller, an energetic comedy and a compelling drama all rolled into one and culminating in a wonderfully cynical ending. It has certainly earned it's place among the top tier of this master's career.",The Player
69,ilpohirvonen,Altman at His Lightest Is Still Brighter Than Standard Hollywood,6,31 December 2015,"Robert Altman is one of the rare American directors who have succeeded in keeping loyal to their own style and vision while also being able to carry on for quite a long time. Altman began directing in television in the 1950's, had his cinematic breakthroughs in the 1970's, and kept working hard until his death in 2006. He always kept a healthy distance to Hollywood, but it seems that he -- like so many others -- had a twofold relationship with the dream factory. The influence of classical Hollywood, which the director adored, is apparent in Altman's cinema, but at the same time he expresses great frustration and even loathe towards Hollywood. Both of these attitudes emerge powerfully in his witty, insightful, and lightweight satire of Hollywood, ""The Player"" (1992) which is filled with references to film history. The story focuses on a Hollywood studio executive, Griffin Mill (played by Tim Robbins) who starts to investigate an abandoned screenwriter sending death threats his way. After murdering the writer more or less unintentionally, Mill falls in love with the writer's girlfriend, but his new life is once again threatened by the police investigating the murder case. In the meantime, Mill's studio is producing a new film whose director wants something else than standard Hollywood entertainment, but the studio has different plans. The line between reality and unreality, fiction and non-fiction begins to blur as Mill's life starts bearing a resemblance to all those film-noir movies whose posters hang on the studio's walls. This is the core of the story to which Altman anchors all the multiple story elements that he enjoys developing. Inter-textual references, satirical jokes, and celebrity appearances might at times feel too much, though they all serve a purpose. The abundance of the film is fragmentary, but this episodic nature of the film does not need to be seen as a flaw, since Altman skillfully keeps it all together. To my mind, the beginning of the film nicely introduces Altman's stylistic program and summarizes this ability of his to keep many threads together. The film begins with a long tracking shot, recording the life inside a Hollywood studio from casual dialogue about movies to awkward pitching producers have to listen to, which seems like a direct reference to Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" (1958) and its famous opening. Like this opening shot, the narrative of ""The Player"" is overall very self-aware; that is, the spectator is invited into taking the representation to account. One is often paying attention to the way things are structured rather than the things themselves. This might be at times alienating -- and intentionally so -- but Altman also strongly focalizes his narrative to the subjective point of view of his protagonist, enhancing the absurdity of the milieu and its surrounding events. All of these narrative elements serve Altman's purposes of criticizing Hollywood. His criticism, though stark and poignant, is hardly hostile, however. Overall, ""The Player"" is a veritably lightweight film in the sense that it doesn't have the emotional heaviness of ""3 Women"" (1977) nor the structural complexity of ""Nashville"" (1975). The film does have its depth, but it is less striking -- for better and worse. All in all, ""The Player"" is a very enjoyable film, but it might be a slight letdown for people familiar with the director's earlier work. Nonetheless, a viewer who loves Altman's films will most likely cherish this one as well, perhaps in a fashion similar to Altman's relationship with Hollywood.",The Player
70,kijii,Unique biting satire on Hollywood,7,22 November 2016,"This is a biting satire on Hollywood, but there are plenty of those around--from the The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) to The Day of the Locust (1975). However, this is an ingenious Hollywood journey as only Altman could make it. It may be fair to say that this is the only movie that this is: ""a movie ABOUT a movie CONTAINING a movie-within-a-movie, loaded with REAL movie stars playing themselves. Altman must have really enjoyed making this one!!The story starts with an INTENTIONAL long tracking shot around a Hollywood studio--similar to the famous one in Orson Wells' Touch of Evil.The story is ABOUT a Hollywood producer, Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), who listens to people 'pitching' movie plots to him. As he goes about his daily routine of meeting, and dining with famous stars, he starts to receive death threats written on post cards. The threats could be coming from ONE of the millions of his disgruntled 'pitchers' over the years. But, the question is WHICH of his former disgruntled 'pitchers' IS it. As he tries to figure out who is threatening him, he traces down, and kills, the 'death threatener' after talking to the killer's Icelandic girlfriend, June (Greta Sacchi), on the phone. A problem arises when—after killing the man—the death threats continue as before. One circuitous path follows another until the movie's surprise ending. While this is not another M*A*S*H, Nashville, Short Cuts or McCabe and Mrs. Miller, it is well worth watching and is an interesting opus in Robert Altman's filmography.",The Player

72,canuckteach,Reality hurts....,9,10 December 2020,"Tim Robbins shines in his role as GRIFFIN MILL, the 'Player', an uncompromising look at the key men who run the movie business. This is not for the squeamish in terms of language, or AA material (I sat through again recently & wondered why-even with the FF button in hand), but if you want a look at how decisions are made in Hollywood, this, plus maybe THE BIG PICTURE with Kevin Bacon, are must-sees.Mill is beset by 2 problems early on: rival Producers at his studio are vying for his projects and a writer-stalker is moving in to murder him for ignoring his submission (could be a simple oversight). Mill gets deeper into trouble when he hunts down the wrong guy to make amends & encounters a truly hardcore, disillusioned screenplay writer who refuses to be amicable. After an angry encounter, Mill is now stuck with dodging rival Producers and a felony charge. What to do, what to do? Along the way, he has brief conversations with friends and foes alike, including Burt Reynolds, who disses him without equivocation, and we overhear cameramen & 2nd Unit guys raving about their favourite 'shots'.How will Mill get out of this mess, with Whoopie Goldberg & Lyle Lovett (yes, the C&W singer-it's called 'stunt casting') as detectives on his tail (and they don't believe a word he says)?

73,JoshtheGiant,Nothing Special,7,1 January 2006,"The Player is a fine film and is very well made but in the end is missing something that I have trouble pin pointing, it is flawlessly written and the plot is one of the best in history, the performances are generally wonderful Tim Robbins in particular, and the film is well directed. Why do I have trouble liking most of it? That may be a mystery to me but lets try and figure it out. The Plot: We meet a slimy movie producer named Griffin Mill. He is apparently being stalked by a writer he turned script away. Mill gets paranoid and jumpy but than finds the man who is doing it. He accidentally kills the man. The police think of him as the top possibility, he is falling in love with the writers girlfriend and the letters continue, but slightly differently. The performances: Tim Robbins is flawless as Griffin Mill and all of the the performances are very good, I loved all the cameos. The Direction:The direction is very good, but not flawless and could have been done better. In all a very good film but not one to see more than once, than again I will watch it again to see if it gets better on a second viewing.",The Player
74,manendra-lodhi,Good,9,30 January 2013,"Another subtle dark comic film from Robert Altman which will irritate you sometimes with its overlapping dialogs and keeps you on the edge of the seat with its extremely strong content. The script has a script and a script and again a script. The engaging portions in Altman's movies are the dialog and a very sweet comedy which will strike the intelligent areas of your brain. You have to analyze and understand. THE PLAYER is about a Hollywood studio executive who reads scripts by people and tells whether it can be converted into a film or not. Some writers get angry and he accidentally is involved in a lot of problems.With this film Altman also gives the audience a small understanding of the movie business. While there are some movies which are made entirely on filmmaking like Day for Night, which do have a charming content as the audience is brought closer to something which they love. The Player has a nice blend of this charming plot of movie business and an amazing script. While seeing the movie I was constantly thinking of Inception which employed a layer of dreams and here too I observed a hell lot of layers of stories. Since the Protagonist himself is involved in reading and recommending film scripts, we are constantly given some new stories all the time and then there is the story on what the film has been made and then there is a story on which the life of the protagonist seems to work. The character of Griffin mill is one which you might have experienced earlier also. When he justifies his work, you are with him and for the rest of the time you have a mixed feeling for him. Tim Robbins as griffin miller performs fairly OK here but I am sort of full of his same type of acting in most of the movies. Greta Scacchi as 'June' has done a very good job. She has brought to the screen a character that is like – 'What the hell' for most of the times. You kind of consider her as a girl who is focused on her career and considers everything else secondary. The backbone of the film still is the brilliant screenplay. The opening shot is extremely commendable for its length and pays tribute to a lot of films.This piece from Altman is definitely engaging and funny. You would not like to miss this one.MESSAGE: 'Life is amazing.'VERDICT: 'A recommended watch.'",The Player

76,shepardjessica,Robbins glides through Altman-ville!,9,9 July 2004,"Robert Altman's best film of the 90's (slightly above Short Cuts) with a innocent gleam in his eye while defacing Hollywood Proper with a million cameos and a great cast.  Tim Robbins was never better (although he's usually better playing slightly feebed-out non-players), but he captures the shallow confidence that works in Tinseltown with timing, good neckties and temporary power that is as smooth as a pina colada in Malibu.  It's not even the best script he ever touched, but Mr. Altman knows how to get the best out of his people (EVER WONDER WHY ACTORS LOVED E. KAZAN?) without slashing/hindering whatever their persona needed to be THAT YEAR.  Most older directors (especially the best) get cynical, senile, and just plain useless if they aren't a part of modern-day lushness.  Not this dude!  I recently saw The Company (not one of his best), but you could see that he still isn't out of it yet. 
It's a wonderful story, so well-cast that you'll crack up (the only time Whoopi Goldberg has been serious (and funny) since The Color Purple), but it's hard drive down Route 66; Hitch a ride!",The Player
77,blakiepeterson,An Irresistible Hollywood Satire,10,2 May 2015,"The movie executives in The Player talk about happy endings with millions of dollars in their eyes. They discuss audiences as if they're puppy dogs hungry for Iams rather than Purina. They look at actors and directors not as assets but as money machines. No star actor attached? No acclaimed director at the helm? Throw the project in Poverty Row, or, better yet, the trash heap. If money isn't being made, who cares?Robert Altman's anthrax lined letter to Hollywood is something that captures the imagination from the minute it starts. It is not a slow burn, nor is it something you have to ""get"" to truly appreciate. If you've ever watched a movie in your life (which I bet you have), then I suggest you watch The Player immediately. You may laugh, you may sigh, and you may humble grumble your way off the couch when it's over, but I guarantee you will never have a Friday movie night ever again that won't be devastated by the truths The Player spits out at a rapid pace. We forget that behind the Oscars, the Cinetopias, and the blockbusters that befall our cities that the movie-making world is a maniacal and very calculated business. As various stars sit down for chats with David Letterman on some random weekday night, they describe their filmmaking experiences in a way that sounds like music to our ears. But in the midst of all that, we forget that the very movie they're promoting would have never been made had there not been a writer that pitched the idea for the film to a green starved movie executive. Sunset Boulevard was a cautionary tale against the Hollywood machine; even if you're the biggest star in the universe, don't be surprised if you're chewed up and spit out within a few years, Day for Night showed the process of making a film, and how just a few difficult actors can make a huge difference in, well  everything. But The Player covers the business aspect of it all. In more ways than one, the life of a head honcho is so chaotic and plain interesting that, in comparison, the turmoiled love life of a tabloid star sounds a little bit humdrum.Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) wears decked-out suits, drives a fancy car, speaks without any hesitation, and isn't afraid to hurt anyone's fragile feelings. Though only in his 30s, he is the hot-shot vice president of a movie studio, pitched nearly 125 ideas a day. The actors whisper about him with daggers in their eyes (Burt Reynolds makes sure to quietly let his friend know that Mill is an asshole only a few seconds after they shake hands). However, Mill's tight and perennially scheduled life is slowly collapsing right under his feet, whether he likes to admit it or not. He is receiving death threats from a scorned writer, a ruthless and highly successful exec from 20th Century Fox (Peter Gallagher) is close to completely stealing his job, and he longs to break up with his girlfriend and colleague (Cynthia Stevenson) who is much too intelligent to be let off the hook without a fight. And as if Mill's life couldn't get anymore complicated, he, in a blind rage, unwittingly murders a screenwriter (Vincent D'Onofrio) who he believed was the blackmailer that has been threatening his every move. And he begins dating his victim's girlfriend (Greta Scacchi) afterward. Whoops and whoops.The Player is a skewering comedy, an unconventional romance, an ensemble film, and nearly a thriller; yet it never loses its footing. Altman got nearly 60 big names to make cameos — while it sounds excessive on paper, it only makes the satirical elements more red hot. All of our favorite actors (Julia Roberts, Jeff Goldblum, Lily Tomlin, Bruce Willis, Susan Sarandon, and more) seem to make an appearance at least once, and we can only kick ourselves. Are the people that we adore with such endurance really a part of this Hollywood machine?The film hurts like a sharp piece of glass, but I loved it with my entirety. Altman is such a brilliant director that you become equally entranced and appreciative within every shot. The dialogue pricks your skin with its sharpness, and the characters are so fully formed that we can see their humanity amidst all the tough talk they speak. I probably should have hated Robbins' character, yet I respected him in a twisted sort of way. He can get away with so much, but that's only because he's smart enough to take control of even the most turbulent of situations.But look at the way Altman sets scenes. Characters talk over each other just as you or me. There is no needless sex, violence, or other assorted gratuities needed to make some extra cash. The Player is everything the executives in the film say a movie should and shouldn't be. There is sex and violence, but neither are needless. The happy ending comes as they would want it to, but it's drenched in humility, not heart-warming tinsel. The ironies come and go, but the genius of The Player doesn't.

78,BadWebDiver,"""Ya really had to have been there at the time to geddit""",4,15 March 2002,"This film feels like the Hollywood equivalent of a Xmas party joke. Y'know, the type when someone comes out in a Santa Claus suit and gives comic awards to The Biggest Boozer, The Boss' Pet, The One Who Needs an Alarm Clock the Most, etc. I can just imagine this going the rounds of the studio offices and people chuckling and going; ""That's Mr X to a T!"" and ""Oh, I definitely work with that type of guy!""; and ""I saw that just yesterday."" It's almost the definitive inside joke; and that's the problem - it's WAY parochial.There's a saying among pro screenwriters that a good script has local application and universal relevance. While the local application of this film is undeniable; I have yet to be convinced what the universal relevance is. Quite frankly, I have never heard anyone who isn't professionally or personally connected to the film industry ever say they liked this. I think films like S.O.B. or THE LAST ACTION HERO work a lot better than this because they're written more from a viewer's perspective. I certainly think Blake Edwards can set up a comic gag a lot better than Robert Altman can. I don't seem to be in tune with Altman's sense of comic timing. (In fact, I'm not sure he even has one).However, if Hollywood thinks stories like this are viable; there's one about the office worker who put an Imperial boilerplate in an Olympic machine and had the whole staff chuckling for a week. I'm almost sure that would make a hot feature film. Or the one about the physics lab assistant who said ""neutron"" when he meant ""neutrino"" (just picture all the scientists rolling on the floor at that one!); almost a sure-fire box office smash! Or the story of the IRS worker who put an F5 header onto a G3 form and had a whole sub-section of a department in turmoil for at least an hour.

Tim Robbins was never better but Fred Ward and Whoopi Goldberg practically steal the film from Robbins, a hard thing to do when Robbins is so perfectly cast. Fred Ward, a character actor for decades, suddenly appears as a ravishing hunk in every shot, his rugged good looks diminishing the dialogue in every scene he's in. Whoopi Goldberg, a riot no matter what she does, tears the house down as a Pasadena Police Department detective hot on Tim Robbins' trail.

Let me begin by saying I *adore* films where the bad guy gets away. The anti-Hollywood ending is always fun, but the truly amusing films are the ones where antagonism or the anti-hero comes out the winner. This is no exception.Tim  Robbins sets out to confront the writer who he assumes is harassing and threatening him (Vincent D'Onofrio, once again playing a goon...though this time more of an artsy intellectual one. I don't think it's possible for that man to truly act any different character...always the same type -yawn-) Tim Robbins ends up raging and killing said writer. Not only does he kill the wrong guy, amusingly enough. Not only does he get away with it, no no no...not only does he GET THE NOW DEAD FALSE-HATE-MAILER's GIRLFRIEND!! (slowly dropping his own in the process...) But he ends up running the company!!!! And he allows his former g/f to get fired, has his former higher-up who he can't stand no sucking up to *him*, AND goes home (nice house!) in a better car, to his now pregnant wife (you guessed it: same dead writer's girlfriend...) How much greater can an ending be??? Huh?? Huh??That said, the movie wasn't great. Oh, it was *good*...even *very good*, but not great. Amusing, probably a lot more so to those on the inside who got more of the caricatures and inside jokes... And I always love the cameos of celebrities playing themselves (which Robert Altman seems to get more and more of each film;) But some of the story dragged a bit too much (especially the police scenes, which went on and on and started to get annoying), and there was some major over-acting. I also really didn't like Greta Scacchi in her role...I don't know why but I found her unconvincing and bland. And I didn't like the fact that the movie sold out in the end (though I understand why...but the former film student in me grinds his teeth together over that;)Overall: a good, solid film, Could have been better...could have been *much* worse!

There were a number of references from older Hollywood movies (like Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil, Gone with the wind and not to forget the vital comic reference to Sunset Blvd.). I particularly loved the long opening scene in which the actors are described. It was a delight to see a whole load of 50+ Hollywood stars appearing as themselves. The movie, made primarily for movie critics, is a direct attack on typical Hollywood studios.

It is not about the Clint Eastwood anti-hero who beats up people but has a heart of gold. No, we see the self absorbed and self centered who will stab you in the back and not think twice. The Player does not try to wrap its cruelty with pretty speeches like Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors. You wonder why OJ did it? The Player will give you a good idea.
The background of the story is the movie business. This provides cutting humor about how scripts are chosen as writers and actors deal with the money people, the executives. Everyone smiles at parties and at restaurants but in a corner whisper what they really feel and it usually isn't very kind. Meanwhile, the executives try to get each other fired by setting clever traps. With Michael Tolkin's script and Robert Altman's direction, a human jungle is created.The people in The Player are not monsters like in some slasher or serial killer movie. They are not part of the Mafia. They seem nice enough, just very wealthy. But they also can do monstrous things. Surrounded by lawyers and other hired help, who can stop them? Part of the brilliance of The Player is that it makes a horrible act seem natural. Money and power is all they want and if someone dies while getting in their way, too bad.It's a Wonderful Life covered some of this ground but softened it with angels and fluff.

The actually story, about a studio executive (in an excellent performance by Robbins), who gets death threats from a crazed screenwriter, is very interesting, but eventually falls apart as the many cameos begin to take center stage.  By the end, the story begins to lag, and when it is all resolved it feels like the movie never really cared about the story in the first place.

There are great, intelligent executives who want to help the process of talent making their best efforts count for something at the end of the day. But they are outnumbered by those who like perks and having a job, so risk taking isn't seen as a good move by those toiling in a giant corporation controlled machine. Too many projects are green lit because the allure of huge profits outweighs artistic merit.Tim Robbins plays a man who's bright enough to be the good kind of exec, but his basic shallowness is too impressed by big offices and flashy premieres to take any actual step in the direction of film art, highfalutin speeches of his aside. And Peter Gallagher is another slick hustler picking any meat left on the bones of cinema's early 1990s carcass, heading on down to the celebrity packed AA meeting to weasel himself into any deal he can.Vincent D'Onofrio is the wound up screenwriter under no delusions whatsoever as to why Tim comes to a theatre to find him. This man who composes the sort of literate scripts Tim and Peter want to turn into beach party flicks has zero patience for any BS and it ends up being his downfall.Robert Altman gets his best work environment ever, as Michael Tolkin adapts his book into a crackerjack script with plenty of exploring room for the legendary improvising director's cast.

87,ALauff,Disconcertingly broad satire awkwardly wed to intriguing ideas,5,20 January 2005,"A satire on the Hollywood system that begins with a tautological assertioncapital is the foremost concern in the production of Hollywood movies, often to the detriment of plausible story lines and galvanizing charactersand ends as a self-reflexive fait accompli to its central working thesis: unable to produce art that reflects reality, Hollywood is a dream factory that inevitably corrupts every pure thing it touches. Altman, essentially, constructed a bad movie in order to satirize and cripple the methods in which bad movies are currently made, as delineated by Tim Robbins in the key scene of the movie: ""We look for certain elements in a script that we can use to effectively promote the movie: Suspense, laughter, violence, hope, heart, nudity, sex, happy endings."" The late revelation that a story pitch made by Robbins' blackmailer actually synopsizes Altman's film, gives the film-within-the-film an immediate postmodern detachment that forces us to reassemble the pieces of the plot in a new framework. Where Altman's film ends and this new, ungainly ""Hollywood-ized"" version begins its arc is anyone's guess, but to me the first signs of something askew occur during Robbins' and Sacchi's border excursion, which in its breadth contain the aforementioned ""rules"" (using Jamie Kennedy's term in Scream) for modern movies and a gratuitously breathy sex scene, and in its aftermath, a deus-ex-machina that extracts our ""hero"" from an open-and-shut police lineup.The ""Happy Ending""which significantly has Robbins' character echoing Bruce Willis' closing line from the test screening of ""Habeas Corpus"" attended by a rival studio exec. (Peter Gallagher), adding yet another layer of reflexivityis a nightmare inversion of filmic expectation, the swelling score a mocking refrain, that underlines the peculiar air of unreality that pervades even the most ""authentic"" of Altman's carefully depth-staged ensemble pieces, wisely trafficked by real movie stars playing themselves in surreal, assuming cameos. It's an odd time for self-interrogation by Altman, as reeled-in as his audience must have been by the broad satire and snide swipes at double-talking suits, but it's creditable that he undermines himself to make a meta-cinematic point about the place for truth/""reality"" in film amidst all the multi-directional flattery, allowing his film's cognitive possibilities to sprout from a very disconcerting place, entreating us to consider that perhaps his broadside deluxe isn't as gleefully one-sided as it often appears. Of course, whether or not this self-generated gamesmanship is enough to offset its supplementary downside is a matter of opinionI say it's not enough.",The Player

They are completely willing to undermine their art in pursuit of the almighty dollar.The main character isn't inherently better than the rest, he's just led through a bizarre series of events that force him to confront the reality of his world and figure a way to navigate its treacherous waters.The completely absurd (yet totally believable) ending made me laugh in a way that few movies do.",The Player

Two creeps (Donofrio and Goldberg)treat 'the-creep-we're- supposed-to hate' with such malice that I felt sorry for him.(Tim Robbins).

Mill is hungry for success, and will go to any length to ensure his success, even resting to murder, though the circumstances around that event are considerably complicated. He treats those around him as players in a game, to be used or defeated in his quest for climbing the film network food chain, rather than as people to cooperate with. The commentary and self reflection posed in the film are satisfying as an audience member, as it is pleasant to see the darker side of film exposed, rather than it being presented as a utopia and wonderland. The way that Mill behaves is unpleasant to see, as it is lacking in normal social aspects, and as such the movie is uncomfortable for me. David Brown (director) had his own meteoric rise to success at 20th century fox, and knows a thing or two about the process, which contributed to the realism of the plot.",The Player
91,audrablum,"Interesting inside look into Hollywood business ""life""",7,23 September 2018,"This week I watched The Player (1992). The premise of the movie is about a studio executive, Griffin, who is being threatened through the mail system for blowing off a writer. Acting out of fear for his life, Griffin makes some poor life decisions, which end up changing the course of his life for the better. Through the power of money and lawyers he manages to evade some consequences. The moral of the story is that there are no morals at the top. I found the story to be interesting and engaging. I thought that the story really gives the viewer things to think about. Visually it was very true to the era; large shoulder pads, ridiculous haircuts, and portable fax machines all lended themselves to a likely modern feel at the time, yet comedic element in retrospect. There were also some scenes with gratuitous female nudity, which I don't care for. Other than that the film was good and I would recommend it if someone really wants to know Hollywood's scandalous forms of normality.",The Player
92,shadow_blade-89459,Great Film,8,20 September 2018,"""The Player"" (1992) is a comedic crime drama about Hollywood studio executive Griffin Mill, played by Tim Robbins, as he lives his life through death threats and the fear of losing his job to an up and comer Larry Levy, played by Peter Gallagher. Griffin makes an attempt to find and halt these death threats while fending off Larry and finds himself in the middle of a murder investigation that is fit for the big screen. At the beginning of this film, I found myself dosing off. There wasn't a character that I connected to on any level, but once Griffin decided to do something about the death threats, my interest was captured. This film initially made me feel inadequate, but I quickly realized, through Griffin's call to action, that the characters are important people with normal people problems. I oddly enjoyed this film despite the slow start.Director Robert Altman did a fabulous job with his shot selection. I really enjoyed that some of the ending sequence shots had extra meanings in plain sight. It added a little splash of comedy to its realness. The acting by the laundry list of celebrities in this film, though many simply had to be themselves, was phenomenal. No one felt out of place with exception to Detective DeLongpre, played by Lyle Lovett. He occasional seemed to stick out like a lost puppy, but he effectively added to the level of curiosity and misdirection. Overall, I have come to really enjoy this film and I recommend at least one viewing to anyone who likes a little crime with their drama.",The Player
93,ierenz,"Altman structures The Player as a film noir, but one that feels like a mildly off-key tune on a piano.",8,22 September 2019,"In this merciless satire, Robert Altman takes on the Hollywood institution over a studio exec that becomes embroiled in a scandal after murdering a threatening jilted writer.Altman structures The Player as a film noir, but one that feels like a mildly off-key tune on a piano.This is a world of fantasy crafted by people who are totally out of touch with reality, and it's as if the movie we're watching is a potboiler cooked up in the boardroom of the very characters we watch. It is a subtle and biting satire of the shallowness and artistic bankruptcy of Hollywood (not to mention moral).The Player is the darkest and most brutal satire in Hollywood since Sunset Boulevard, featuring a true who's who of the early 90s star cameos. It also looks particularly good on Blu-Ray, the Criterion folks working their magic to take this movie out of the early 90's and make it feel amazingly modern. This is one movie that hasn't lost its bite",The Player
94,smithpaulusmc,Hollywood Laughs at Itself,7,19 February 2020,"Robert Altman's 1992 film The Player is a black comedy satire of the time's modern Hollywood. The work is based on screenwriter Michael Tolkin's novel of the same name and centers on the life of self-centered Hollywood studio executive Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) who has been receiving death threats from an unnerved writer for the past several months. After going to confront David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio), the man he believes is the death note writer, Mill accidently kills him and flees the scene. The rest of the film follows Mill as he attempts to maintain his innocence all while falling in love with Kahane's former lover.Rather than presenting itself as a ""standard"" film, The Player prefers to poke fun at then established Hollywood norms and tropes. In particular, The Player satirizes Hollywood's inability to make a movie with anything other than a happy ending and extremely well-known actors. The Player even features scores of Hollywood's greats including Bruce Willis, John Cusack, Cher, and Jeff Goldblum in cameos as themselves. This serves to create a feeling of authenticity within The Player's universe all while allowing Hollywood to take the joke in stride. Several of the tropes The Player satirizes get used as plot points in the film. Mill is let off after a stroke of luck has the only witness to the murder incorrectly identify the killer she saw. Mill has sex with Kahane's former lover even though the act adds nothing to the story. The Player even uses extensive long cuts and interweaving dialogue because it can, not because it should. In total, these subliminal pokes leave the audience dissecting The Player long after it has ended.The Player is a success. It set out on a mission to entertainingly dismantle the established Hollywood order and it accomplished that with ease. If anything, I feel the ending was rushed and the middle was too long. Perhaps a few more plot movers would have better fleshed out the story. Still, I was very pleased with the film and would recommend it to most.",The Player

97,Doc-134,The Truth About The Hollywood Dream Machine,10,28 April 1999,"Come next year, when I am trying to devise a list of the best films of the 90's, Robert Altman's ""The Player"" will be near the top of my list. This film skillfully creates a central plot around Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) (who hears about 125 movie pitches per day), a studio executive who is being threatened by a writer whose script or idea he likely brushed off. But what is even more brilliant about ""The Player"" is everything going on peripherally to the main plot; all the references to studio techniques of film-making, foreign film movements, homages and Old Hollywood vs. New Hollywood. The film is multi-layered, yet everything that we view falls neatly into the formula which Hollywood film-making survives by. What we see in the duration of ""The Player"" would potentially make a perfect pitch for a movie. This may sound confusing, but watch the entire film, and you will immediately know what I mean.The film begins with a stunning homage to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rope"", an approximately eight minute long take where the camera moves freely around a studio encountering many people in the midst of their everyday routines. For example, we come across a couple discussing how Hollywood film is now much like MTV ""cut, cut, cut"". One of the characters even uses the example of ""Rope"" to illustrate his point. ""Rope"" is approximately a ninety minute film that appears to have been shot all in one take. Of course, it wasn't done in one take, as reels of film at that time were only ten minutes long. If one watches the film very closely, it can be determined where the cuts are made.In the duration of the same take, we encounter Griffin Mill conducting business in his office. People walk into his office pitching movie ideas. It is here that we begin to learn about populist Hollywood film-making. Ideas, not stories or scripts are pitched to executives ""in 25 words or less"". Almost always, the ideas thrown out are based on previous films (e.g. ""someone always gets killed at the end of a political thriller"") and even combinations of previous films (e.g. ""It's Pretty Woman meets Out of Africa""). When we see the usual films that are released into theaters each week, it is not difficult to believe that this is the way in which they are conceived. The usual Hollywood formula entails sex, violence, familiarity and most important of all ""happy endings, a movie always has to have a happy ending"".""The Player"" is filled with loads of Hollywood stars, most of them playing themselves. Jeff Goldblum, Malcolm McDowell, John Cusack, Angelica Huston, and Burt Reynolds to name a few. Many of them are encountered at restaurants during lunch and at night time Hollywood gatherings, where the topic of conversation is always movies. Near the beginning of the film, Griffin suggests that he and his lunch guests talk about something else. ""We're all educated adults"". Of course no one says anything. Their lives are so indoctrinated by Hollywood, they do not know what else to talk about.Right from the beginning Griffin receives numerous postcards threatening his life. He begins to suspect a certain writer and goes to his house one night to confront him. The man turns out not to be home, but there is an incredible scene where Griffin talks with the man's girlfriend on the phone while voyeuristically watching her through the window. This is an extraordinary symbolization of the voyeuristic essence that goes along with watching a film, or the notion of scopophilia to be precise. The idea behind the concept of scopophilia is that the cinema constructs the spectator as a subject; the beholder of the gaze, who has an intense desire to look. The cinema places viewers in a voyeuristic position in that the viewer watches the film unseen in a dark room. While Griffin is watching the girl as he speaks with her, it is night time and he remains unseen to her. This scenario metaphorically represents the theater and the film.In the duration of Griffin's conversation on the phone, he finds out that the man he is looking for is watching ""The Bicycle Thief"" in an art-house theater in Pasadena. This film in itself represents the first contrast to Hollywood that we see in ""The Player"". Vittorio DeSica's ""The Bicycle Thief"" was part of a movement that lasted from 1942 to 1952 called Italian Neo-Realism"", whose other main exponents were Rossellini and Visconti. Rossellini called neo-realism both a moral and an aesthetic cinema. Neo-realism, to a great extent owes much of its existence to film-makers' displeasure at the restrictions placed on freedom of expression. This film movement is quite different from the modern Hollywood formula of film-making. When Griffin first meets the man he suspects is sending the postcards, he suggests that perhaps they could do a remake of ""The Bicycle Thief"". The man responds with ""yeah sure, you'd probably want to give it a happy ending"".Also interesting in ""The Player"" is one of the studio executives suggestions to newspapers as a source for script ideas. This serves to contrast Old Hollywood versus New Hollywood. In the older days of studio film, Warner Brothers (one of the studio's of middle-class America) would produce films with ideas seemingly drawn from real life or from the headlines of major newspapers. This gives us the sense that often Hollywood is stuck for original ideas, so ideas from the past re-circulate themselves.I have touched on only a few of the many interesting references that run peripherally to the main plot of ""The Player"". The great thing is that even if you do not catch all the film references that I have been discussing, it is still enjoyable. When I first saw the film, I was really young and did not know much about movies, but yet I enjoyed it thoroughly. Now, it is one of my favorites. I definitely recommend it to anyone who has a keen interest in film.**** out of ****",The Player

What was special about that scene is the way that everyone's sentences overlap with one another, they were all talking at the same time and that felt like real life dialogue. One thing I think film can do really well, better than any other medium is capture the reality of conversations. In a book no matter how you lay it out, one piece of dialogue has to follow an other, you can't simulate people talking over each other, which is what we all do all the time. I don't see it very after this kind of realistic dialogue, and that is why I applaud the director and the writer here, they really had an ear for real life dialogue.
The film has a particular tone since the very start and doesn't lose it throughout the whole running time.

Like Mash, with the long, boring, pointless football game at the end, where they spit on Radar. Sure it became a good TV series, but Altman didn't write the script.Also, ""The Player"" was too long. After a while, it even gets boring to watch a parade of celebs. And the movie within the movie. I guess they though it was pretty clever then, and people do now, but it's been done many times before, and better.

I was interested in it because the sampling to explain movie listings in either my local newspaper or TV Guide for many years was ""The Player"". After my brother came in to the front room with the VHS copy that he rented and insisted that I watch it, of course I did. He liked it. I see why.The Player is a nice commentary on the brutality of Hollywood. In particular, how the quality and the integrity of a piece is compromised for profit. As Tim Robbins' character Griffin Mill clearly states, a movie has to have certain elements to it in order to be successful in Hollywood. Such elements are sex/nudity, violence, and the like. Furthermore, it has to play out and end in a manner deemed acceptable to widespread audiences.As an executive, Mill's job is to listen to writers pitch their screenplays, and to green-light the ones he think will turn a profit. Of course, he turns down many, many more screenplays than he green-lights. This draws the ire of some mentally unstable writers, one of which begins sending him death threats and making attempts on his life. As Mill gets caught up with a screenwriter who he believes is threatening him, he must now balance his career while trying to clear his name.What I liked about this movie (and you will like too) is that while it maintains the aforementioned tropes ""needed"" to make a film successful, it in fact violates one or two of them. These play a big part in two subplots within the movie. You may see the end coming, you may not.

To start, the screenplay is first-rate.  The plot that holds the entire film together is superbly crafted; very few films leave you guessing right to the end as this one does.  The finer details also shine through, such as the sales pitch scenes, which are inarguably classic (i.e. ""The Graduate II"").I loved the attention to detail in ""The Player"".  One can find a new detail every time one watches the film.  For example, the opening sequence is a very long, continuous shot during which characters are discussing Hitchcock's ""Rope"", which appears to be a movie filmed all in one continuous shot.  The sheer number of cameos in ""The Player"" makes it difficult to list all of them, so I won't even try.""The Player"" is one film that sets out to skewer Hollywood and actually succeeds.

The film takes a neat twist when he decides to pitch a movie based on the idea of getting away with murder. In a metafictional touch, Altman/Tolkin leave you wondering whether their film is the movie he ends up producing. Some dead-on satire of moviemaking.

One could also say this movie was, in a very understated way, a satire of America as a whole and as an elitist might say, how the American movie going public (and many critics,too) actually accept much of the garbage that comes out of Hollywood as truly ""great works of art"" (e.g. ""Knocked Up"" and other pieces of crap). Just as the ending of this film shows, the really great films generally don't do that well at the box office, and the typically clichéd ""happy ending"", blah,blah,blah, films are blockbusters. Of course in reality there are exceptions, but not often enough.

Great cast, witty dialogue, at most parts it's funny, self aware and gets twisted where and when you don't see it coming. Here's the thing though. When you write a movie specifically about writing movies and how endings make or break them, how do end up with a lazy one? Honestly, how?This film is obsessed with talking about endings and them being sad because that's real as opposed to a Hollywood ending. There is a villain in this film who writes letters and instigates most of the action and remains pretty well hidden throughout. Unexpected events transpire and as the protagonist tries to get out of the situation, well things get twisted and lines get blurred/crossed and well things go haywire. It's quite entertaining and you don't ever truly know where it's going.Then the writers have it just skip forward a year, which is already a bad sign and..................I'm sorry but your movie cannot be about movies and their endings and then have a cataclysm for a plot-hole be yours.Straight up, if this was 10-20 minutes longer, filled its plot hole and addressed any of the first 40 minutes to an hour of its runtime and ended the same way, 7-9 easy.",The Player
117,oecobius,Tedious and self-indulgent,3,10 November 2013,"""The Player"" is a film with a lot of technical effort and work on display, but the story is so weak, tiresome and meaningless that this film will disappoint anyone willing to look past the fluff. The opening shot of the film is the most entertaining part of the entire feature: a single long tracking shot featuring a variety of laughable Hollywood types going about their business. The film falls apart, however, when it expects us to actually care about these characters.The Player is about an executive who is blackmailed by a mysterious rejected writer. This is a premise loaded with possibilities, but the protagonist bumbles through the weak plot as if determined to be as boring as possible. We aren't supposed to like him, but we don't actively dislike him either; we don't care at all what happens to him, and since the film's message is made clear within its first shot, there is no point to wasting 2 entire hours on this overrated film. The message is that Hollywood people are phony and hypocritical--hardly an inspired concept. And yet the film reiterates this tired, cheap idea over and over as if its audience is too stupid to grasp it the first time. This leads to a clichéd ""clever"" ending that might impress preteens but only serves to repeat the film's meager message for the umpteenth time.I was hoping this film would move me or make me think, but The Player seems mostly comprised of filler. Even the romance subplot feels contrived and empty; the film presents Greta Scacchi's character as if she will have some depth and purpose, but she is a stereotypical vessel who, like most of the characters, ultimately acts as little more than a cheap plot device.The film has many allusions to classic cinema, such as the motif of an abrupt zoom in on old film posters. This, however, is NEVER clever, subtle, or unexpected because the film hits you over the head with these allusions and overuses them relentlessly, as if Altman couldn't stop saying ""See what I did there?? It's that thing some of you recognize!""There is cute window dressing throughout the picture, but most frequently this film uses an unconventional or awkward shot just for the sake of being unusual. Many people have mindlessly praised this as brilliant and avant-garde, but there is no inspired meaning to the odd yet frankly drab cinematography. It does not make you think, it does not make you uncomfortable, it does not impart a message.",The Player
118,MeesTW,It's a movie movie movie,8,17 February 2017,"If you are a film buff, then The Player is one of the films you have to see.This movie feels fresh, but also feels like a great homage to classic filmmakers which are mentioned throughout. It has Welles' camera movement and look, Hitchcock's suspense and madness and a story which would suit Billy Wilder (and Hitchcock as well). While watching this film I couldn't help but be impressed by the sheer cleverness of the writing. The movie is referencing, foreshadowing and contradicting itself non stop. Which makes the movie predictable and surprising at the same time. It's like a very subtle fourth wall break which keeps coming back.Movies about Hollywood are usually satire with a bit of a comedic spin, but this film is very straight forward with it's anti-Hollywood approach. Our lead played by Tim Robbins (who gives a great performance) is not a good man, yet he's very successful backstabbing the people that care about him. The editing of this movie is good, but the 2nd act needed work. This movie has no right being two hours long and the middle just needed to be sped up a bit, no matter how many great cameos there are.This is the first time I have watched a movie, about movies about movies.",The Player

Movie has a different way of tension and storytelling, which bored me a lot. No action, no fun stuff, bad scripts with dull spirit and add artificial acting on it.

129,fmorrison,Genius envy,7,3 July 2002,"Shortly after the release of ""The Player"" Film Comment magazine published an interview with director Robert Altman. There had been much praise for his long opening tracking shot. Naturally, this invited comparison to the grand-daddy of such shots, the opening of Welles's ""Touch of Evil"". In the interview, Altman was quoted as saying about the Welles shot that it was ""the most grotesquely self-indulgent thing I've ever seen"". I could understand Altman lashing out at the film school brats who are making all the money, but to make such a derisive comment about a fellow maverick (the ultimate maverick) reveals a major inferiority complex. Altman seems to believe that he is not regarded with sufficient reverence. With that kind of attitude, he doesn't deserve to be.",The Player
130,iraava,"Well, I didn't enjoy it, but..",6,10 June 2020,"It's not a movie to really be enjoyed. It is a movie that shows what a movie is at its worst, like The Day of the Locust. Unfortunately just not as good of a movie to me. It is self referential inside the self reference and again inside the self reference, so although fun at first, it very soon gets tidious. When almost no-one in this films world cares for anything, it's very hard for the viewer to care for it. Nevertheless, I'll side on it being a purposeful choice of alienation.The Player is a film that critiques the ugly vanity of Hollywood much like What Ever Happened to Baby Jane, but here we have removed all of whats good of old Hollywood (Joan Crawford) that we wanted to be saved in Baby Jane from the wretched decay of the old horse (Bette Davis) and are just left with the corpsebride. In the Player there is nothing but the superficial; name dropping and simple sales pitches of suspense, violence and sex. Unfortunately we lose the hope, heart and humor.The male lead is an empty husk that corrupts art for his power trip and destroys all the true artists he comes in contact within the film. The female lead is an empty husk who creates endless colorless, feelingless, meaningless art for no one to see. She is a beautiful fake artist, not even really from Iceland. They are a perfect match because she is exactly what he creates in the world. Their love for each other is also fake, it is based on their common lack of emotion, the big pretension of love that is actually just lust for filling a hole with something, anything.So it also goes that this movie itself has not much substance to hold on to. I get the references to freaks; how grotesque it is to mutilate art but it's self indulgent and childish in its black and whiteness, offering the image of the artist as either a calf up for slaughter or a corrupt cog in the game of psychopaths power struggles. Nevertheless I think there's very little of this movie that could be changed; it serves it purpose.To sum up I would like to enter the referential cycle by quoting Cher in The Player, quoting Carol Burnett in The Four Seasons, quoting Pinhead in the comic book Pinhead: ""Are we having fun yet?""",The Player

137,warlund71,The Player all too revisited,7,17 April 2011,"The late Robert Altman still took chances by adding a fresh element to each of his films before his death a few years ago. And what I mean by that is that he did not employ the same staff each time (which so many old directors seem to do these days) because he was ""comfortable"" with them. Even though I am not a true fan to his body of work (though I did sit through ""Short Cuts"" and ""M*A*S*H""), I was very impressed of the man's mindset when interviewed and choices that he made back then.Nineteen years after its release and now I review it: and back in 1992, I thought it was probably the most interesting films of that year. At the time in the early 1990s, movies were filmed and lit with a TV Movie-of-the-Week look and motif, rendering them all indistinguishable and mediocre. Perhaps it was star-power that garnered successes with so many of these films (like what was even mentioned in one of the screen writing pitches within the film, ""no stars""), so then I mostly dismissed them with the exception of a few worth watching. If it wasn't for CGI, movies would STILL be like what they were then. However, this film doesn't take my breath away to this day every time I watch it, but it's well-done although not really that memorable.So the plot is as follows: Tim Robbins is a snake of a successful studio executive named Griffin Mill, who is quickly singled out by an embittered writer who was supposedly brushed off by him months earlier and now doling out death-threats from the man. So in an effort to sever it, Mill seeks out the writer and locates him and then accidentally kills him in a rage, thinking that that is the end to this. Only it isn't, and he's still receiving threats (which get more and more dangerous). And when ""accompanying"" the late writer's ""grieving"" girlfriend (played by Gretta Scacci) afterwards, Mill finds himself the suspect of the murder to this writer. Though I won't give away anything else, it is definitely worth watching if you're in touch or familiar with the Hollywood system, and how movies seem to get made these days. There are a handful of cameos of actors who simply play themselves in this (in the end renders them dated, antiquated and obsolete- I say this because so many of them are dead now). Still, there is a sense of verite' in it all with the addition of these cameos and perhaps that is one of the charms to such a low-budget film of the times.If you're into Zack Snyder or Judd Apatow, then skip this- it would be an insulting bore: otherwise, check this out.",The Player
138,JamesB-4,One of the best films ever made.,10,22 January 1999,"Directed by Robert Altman (Short Cuts)Written by Michael Tolkin (Deep Impact), based on his novelStarring Tim Robbins (The Shawshank Redemption), Greta Scacchi (Presumed Innocent), Fred Ward (Dangerous Beauty), Whoopi Goldberg (Sister Act), Peter Gallagher (To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday), Brion James (D.O.A.), Cynthia Stevenson (Forget Paris), Vincent D'Onofrio (Men In Black)As Reviewed by James Brundage From the master of independent cinema, Robert Altman, comes the blackest of satires, The Player.  Postmodern, intelligent, suspenseful, funny, brilliant.  All of these very useful adjectives apply to this film.  There is no way around it: The Player is great.The Player, as I stated, is a black satire from the director of Short Cuts, M*A*S*H, and Nashville.  It follows Griffin Mills (Tim Robbins), a villain we love to hate, and, ironically, our main character.  Mills is getting postcards.  Each one is a threat on his life, and telling others, due to the fact that his position as a studio exec is threatened by up-and-coming producer Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher), is a threat on his career.At the beginning, Mills is charismatic, even likable.  But he's quickly shown for the snake that he is.  In the words of Tim Robbins, who deserved but was not even nominated for an academy award for his role, `he's manipulative, he's a son of a bitch.'  It's true, it's all true. The threatening postcards lead him to believe that a writer is sending them. A rejected writer.  However, in the cruel industry of movies which kills more ideas than W.W.II killed people, this does not narrow it down.  What does narrow it down is one of the more bizarre moments of the film.  He's in the hot tub with Bonnie, story editor and girlfriend (and, by, the way, the only moral character of the movie), when he asks her about his own life. However, unable to formulate it into his own life, he explains it through movies.  He gives her a pitch, asks her how long it will be before the writer-in-question becomes dangerous, and she narrows the selection of writers down by providing a five-month time period before danger arrives.Using this, he selects David Kahayne, hack-writer of the bubonic plague of Hollywood: the unhappy ending.  David's what movie people call `unproduced', a writer who's a member of the WGA (Writer's Guild of America, which holds a fairly good monopoly on writers in Hollywood) but who hasn't sold a script. He calls his girlfriend June Gudmundsdottir (Gretta Scacchi, pronounced good man's daughter) and finds out where to find him.  The surprise there, of course, is that his nickname is, according to June is `the dead man'.Kahayne is in Pasadena, enjoying himself at the Rialota watching The Bicycle Thief.  Mills confronts him about the postcards, and, in a fit of rage, kills him in a parking lot. Of course, fitting with the Hollywood that it satires so well, he didn't kill the right person.  And now, Griffen Mills is being investigated by the police, is falling in love with June, is trying to secure his position as head of the studio, and, on top of it all, fearing for his life.The movie is artistically brilliant and interestingly postmodern.  In a very ironic way, the ending is the beginning: a pitch by the mysterious psychotic writer of a movie called The Player, about the events you have just seen. It references itself: naming the record for a tracking shot in an American motion picture (formerly held by Orson Wells' Touch of Evil) while breaking it.  Having a main character from D.O.A. being asked if he remembers the film.  Talking about eliminating the writers from the artistic process the day after Mills has murdered the writer.There normally isn't much I can say about a film.  In my life, there are maybe ten films I could go on and on about, and you have the luck to hopefully see this one.  It makes statements.  It predicts things.  It was ironic at the time it came out and is ironic now.For instance, Griffin Mills is quoted as saying `movies areart, now more than ever' while, at the very same time in the real world, movies were flocking back to the existence of the art film.  It is sheltered in a unique ambiguity: June discovers the Mills killed her boyfriend and doesn't care.  The good are punished, the bad survive: Bonnie is fired and left for proverbial dead while June and Mills live happily ever after.This is the film for movie buffs.  It makes you stop and think about what speeds in front of your face at 24 frames a second.  It states things about the industry in a uniquely detached manner, where people talk about all the dark things of the industry as if they were drinking cappuccinos.For instance, another quote by Griffin Mills, asshole producer but satiric god, addresses the elements needed in a modern studio film: `Suspense, laughter, violence.  Hope, heart.  Nudity, sex.  Happy Endings.'It is brilliant.  It is one that you have to own.  It is the movie to watch.",The Player

How guilty is a murderer who never gets caught, anyway? And given half the chance, we'd swap places with him in a second to get what he's got!

140,Matthew Robillard,This Movie Took Over My Life Twenty Years Ago.,10,13 April 2012,"Even though it was released some twenty years ago this week, to me, ""The Player"" was never just a movie, but more like a parallel universe I've often wanted to escape back to, a hot, dusty place when people still dressed in suits, and movie execs still made movies as opposed to franchises and marketing campaigns. I moved to L.A. in 1993, and remember Hollywood being very much like the film: a small town, a bit run down, cliquish, but still open to outsiders and willing to hear pitches from unknowns like myself. L.A. was in the grips of recession back then, so everyone was still looking for the next big thing. ""The Player"" captures that era perfectly. Compared to now and a corporate Hollywood controlled by faceless multinationals, I often wish I could go back to ""Player Land"" and begin again.I call it ""Player Land"", because Bob Altman (Director), Michael Tolkin (Writer), Tim Robbins (Lead), Thomas Newman (Score), Jean Lepine (DOP), and everybody else who contributed to the making of this picture managed to achieve the greatest thing any film can do: pull the viewer into it's reality while infecting them with an obsessional preoccupation of all things presented within it.In plain English: I think of this film at least once a day.

141,aalia,What about...? *vague spoiler ahead*,8,28 October 2001,"As a Hollywood movie lover, watching Altman's 'The Player' definitely gave me a shock. The film ensures that the audience is not only fully aware that they are watching a film, but also that they will ironically acknowledge the qualities of the typical Hollywood movie. The blunt reality of life cannot be avoided - criminals are not always punished, and success goes to those who know how to ""play the game"".After watching 'The Player', I am now never satisfied with a Hollywood film. When films so closely resemble a formula, the lack of complexity puts a haunting question mark on the industry's integrity - at least until a satire such as this is able to challenge us.",The Player
142,vincesitter,The quintessential Hollywood movie,8,28 September 2018,"Robert Altman was a master filmmaker. Not everyone's cup of tea but if you like him I think you will enjoy The Player- a satirical take on the film industry. Starring Tim Robbins and a host of cameos (An Altman trait) the Player follows a studio executive's fight for survival after he accidently kills a screenwriter. Featuring some amazing sequences including an astonishing opening scene long take this film is one of the finest examples of Altman's wit and craftsmanship. The film wasn't a huge success upon release, but it is considered a great film now. I suggest you give this film a chance because this is auteur theory in tinsel town at its finest.",The Player

I thought it was a little above average when the credits started to roll. The video had an interview with Altman.

146,Guinevere723,A Delicious Hollywood Satire Not to be Missed!,9,27 February 2010,"You want to know what really bugs me? When movies like this never get near the amount of recognition that they rightfully deserve. Robert Altman's 'The Player' proves itself to be one of the most ingenious concepts to have ever come out of Hollywood. A delicious satire/social commentary on the film-making industry, 'The Player' provides clever, insightful and witty social remarks on the truly formulaic and distasteful business side of movie-making. Not only does it manage to dish out some cunning jabs at Hollywood and its various constituents, but it is also good-humored enough to not take itself too seriously by poking fun at its own ironies.The film's main focus revolves around Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), a notorious Hollywood studio executive at the top of his game whose life suddenly comes to a grinding halt when he starts receiving threatening postcards from an anonymous, embittered writer whose script he rejected several months prior. In an attempt to uncover the identity of the mysterious writer, Mill ends up accidentally killing an innocent man in a heated altercation, thinking he was the anonymous writer. Once he discovers he made a devastating mistake, this sordid turn of events turns Mill's world upside-down and creates a whirlwind of lies, deceit and corruption that he desperately tries to not only keep up, but ultimately get away with in the end.Though 'The Player' may seem to be geared more towards ""avid film watchers"" (individuals who are more apt to understand and appreciate the in's and out's of the film-making industry, its practices, and the big names who run it), it can still be enjoyed by the occasional movie-goer as an edge-of-your-seat, cat and mouse thriller filled with the sort of traditional mystery and suspense that old, classic Hollywood was known for churning out in the Golden Age.",The Player
147,roush14,The Player,6,22 May 2006,"The movie, The Player, is all about the way Hollywood is run. It makes fun of how the movie making process is taken place. Shows how people will do anything to get a movie made or to get into a top chair position. Then there are people just trying to get back at the producers if they didn't accept a movie. The character Griffin didn't know who was sending him all those threats by post cards. He killed the wrong guy and just like in Hollywood, he got away with it and the girl. Just goes to show how it's really done in Hollywood. It was pretty exciting how Griffen almost got caught for the crime. At that point you think he's done with, but then the witness picks the wrong person. Other than all that, the movie was pretty good. It's fun seeing something get made fun of. Then it finishes off with the name of the movie, The Player.",The Player
148,mikelogan,This is the worst movie Robert Altman has directed,1,1 April 2002,I personally think MASH and Nashville are two of the best movies of all time.  And although I enjoyed Gosford Park it was merely a guilty pleasure. The Player however is a rip off from start to finish (especially the non-ending - you know one of those and one year later . . . endings that tells you that the writer got fired.) One of my personal ways of determining whether I like a movie is how many times I look at my watch during it.  The movie was 15 minutes old and I had already looked at my watch five times. .. Avoid this movie at all costs.,The Player
149,vmenv,Interesting and entertaining,9,4 January 2005,"This film works on different levels. Its comment on Hollywood is truly funny and biting. But the story is gripping as just a drama about power and greed. The fact that we identify with the main character and dare I say - want him to get away with murder - shows how well this story was crafted. Yes you can love and hate someone at the same time. OK - it doesn't do it as well as the Godfather - but the Godfather doesn't make you laugh at the same time. The end of this film is hysterical. Since I grew up in Canoga Park I almost fell off my chair when the line came about how us ""Valley consumers"" will eat up the new ending to the film being made. If you haven't seen The Player and you like movies - go rent this one. You will not be disappointed.",The Player
150,paticula1135,A Very Different Film,7,19 August 2014,"The Player opens with one of the most interesting shots I've ever seen in a film. It's so interesting that I'm actually talking about it. Rather than what one usually sees, which is clips that occur well within 30 seconds or less of each other, The Player goes out of its way to present one of the most long-winded and continuous shots, with a slowly panning camera around a film studio. As the camera makes its round, we are treated to the sight of at least forty extras going about their usual business. Ideas are being pitched, employees are being reprimanded, producers lay back and seem unmoved by anything and it goes on and on for almost a full ten minutes. Ten minutes of continuous shot. Needless to say, it already makes itself highly stylized in its opening scene and also represents the turmoil of a film producer. Which is what the film is about.So, during this opening shot, we actually do see our main character, a tough and shrewd producer. He's not like many of the main characters I've seen before. He's an executive; part of the faceless mass of a company. He's a producer, notorious for playing it safe and only publishing films he knows the public will buy tickets for. Action films, with happy endings and Bruce Willis as the lead. He's living the good life of an executive. He's on schedule, the boss' favorite, dating his secretary and enjoying his wealth. Essentially, he's exactly the sort of person we tend to blame all our economic issues on; the 1% if you will.However, all is not well in his life, as he's been receiving postcards, with threats written all over them, by a mysterious film maker he seemingly rejected. This isn't entirely surprising. As an executive who runs through about 1000 pitches a year, he can't afford to say yes to all of them, so he has a hard time making friends with writers. But this particular sender seems to want to kill the producer, so he's rightfully scared when he receives a stack of about fifty at once, all of them carrying inscriptions of how much the writer hates him. The film folds on from there, and there are a few very interesting plot twists and turns, as well as some rather crowbar plot moves that seem to be there solely for symbolism or because the script writer thought it would look cool on camera.The Player is a different film. It's not as kind as most other films are to its protagonist, nor is it even full of very much action, though it does have a bit of romance. The film is oddly unconventional while conforming to many clichés. It seems to do so with a certain sense of irony, but it doesn't always work in the film's favor, as these moments can seem out of place and awkwardly handled. That and the romance in the film isn't really what I wanted to see in any way, though part of my suspects that's what it's supposed to be like. There's also something about the entire plot's premise that seems a little heavy handed. But there are some really fantastic moments, which make it all worthwhile. If you haven't seen the film, I'd recommend at least giving it a fling. I can't guarantee this is the kind of movie you'll want to watch again and again, but it's worth viewing.",The Player

This ""movie within a movie"" has it all. Suspense, drama, comedy, great and numerous cameos, and some ""inside Hollywood"" jokes. One highlight is at the start where the actors are describing the best long opening tracking shots of all time while Robert Altman skillfully is showing you one at the same time! The Burt Reynolds cameo is very funny, sounds unscripted, and is one of many brilliant uses of this device. Favorite line: ""waiter, this is a wine glass. I'd like my water in a water glass"". The line comes from Tim Robbins, who is excellent as studio executive Griffin Mill.",The Player
152,Altmaniac,"Altman, Hollywood, and the movies",8,3 April 2001,"The Player (based off the Michael Tolkien novel) is a stunning satire of Hollywood and the big studios.  It could be said that this movie sends Altman's opinion on the matter as well.  The film itself is a stunning example of intellectual filmmaking (including the opening sequence which is a reference to Orson Wells' Touch of Evil, not The Rope as someone previously mentioned).  This film contains, possibly, Tim Robbins best performance as a sleazy studio exec investigated for murder (and being threaten by, presumably, a writer that he's turned down).  It can be argued that Altman deserved to win best director for this film in 1992 as it is such a work of creativity.  Despite the slightly mean tone of the work it is definetly enjoyable and stands as one of Altman's 3 greatest works (Nashville and MASH being the other 2).",The Player

Our movies starts out with a long tracking shot which introduces all of the characters that will later play a major role in this production. I particularly love the fact that within the first 2 seconds of the movie the director establishes the fact that we are watching a movie of a movie. This only adds to the drama. As the movie progresses the star of the show, Griffin Mills played by Tim Robbins, finds himself getting into an incredibly sticky situation. Your going to have to watch the movie to find out what exactly goes on, but I will tell you this. You do have to sit threw the entire thing to fully find out what happens.

This allowed for the writers to say a lot about how the movie industry was being run during the 90s. I especially liked how the English writer had his idea for this great movie that was going to end sadly. Because life is sad and people dying is a real occurrence. And also how stubborn he was to allow well-known actors to be in it. But by the end of the movie greed overcame him too. This resulted in the ending being changed to something happier and the two leads were replaced with two ""a"" list actors.",The Player

I have seen the movie on VHS. When you are Tim Robbins, Peter Gallagher, Whoopi Goldberg, Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis or Brion James fan, then watch this movie 2 Times.

The strength and backbone is established in the many movie stars like Jack Lemmon and Rod Steiger who were willing to make cameos and how specific successful movies are targeted for sequels and re-visions. For example, Buck Henry, appearing as himself (the screenwriter of the Graduate) lobbies the studio, for a sequel for The Graduate as a proposal to make some much needed money.The editing shows in detail, the running of the fictional studio, who were out to alter and determined to make remakes of their famous movies and how murder is always on the cards.The Player may seem at times, stretched out too often, to hide the gaps, but it should be best viewed by people who have a good knowledge of old Hollywood films in the timescale of the 1940s to 1980s.",The Player

The movie works very well as a satire of the film making industry, showing how savage and tasteless the process can get. The several cameos were fun to see and while the story might not be very compelling, it's certainly ingenious and very entertaining.

Only narcissistic Hollywood people might find this flick amusing. Characters come in and out of the sequences while adding little or no depth. The audience sees, but discovers nothing. If one likes a movie that splices together nice shots, short acting exercises, smarmy dialogue, bad jokes, silly conventions, and vacuous glimpses into the lifestyle of show business types... then one might like this flick. The Player builds story, context, insight, and human grandeur about as much as the average adult video. Perhaps the director wanted to make a movie where the audience fills in the many, many blanks they find, but somehow I doubt that. In the end, The Player is contemptuous and sarcastic of moviegoers.

164,Dieter Rogiers,Robert Altman at his brilliant best.,10,15 July 2001,"After spending the eighties more or less in the Hollywood wilderness, Robert Altman came back with a vengeance in 1992, courtesy of The Player, his best film since the mid 70's. What makes The Player such an outstanding movie is the fact that it's not one, but many movies. You can enjoy it as a satire on Hollywood, but also as a romantic comedy or as a thriller. The script by Michael Tolkin is crisp and witty and the performances of the actors are just perfect, which is only to be expected from an Altman film. Especially Tim Robbins shines, displaying charm en repulsion at the same time. Still, we can't help but love his character. But the real star of the movie is Robert Altman's direction. In less capable hands The Player might have turned out a dud, but Altman, with his years of experience working inside AND outside the Hollywood system, manages to poke fun at the right times without being disgruntled. And then there is of course that wonderful opening tracking shot, clocking in as a single take of 8 minutes plus. This opening sequence is already up there with the likes of Omar Shariff's mirage appearance in Lawrence of Arabia and Jimmy Stewart's sense of Vertigo in Hitchcock's film as one of the most audacious shots in movie making ever. All in all, The Player is probably the best film to come out of the nineties and it has left an indelible impression on me.",The Player

The storyline is what kept me in my seat watching the movie. It is full of twist and turns and a look into the real life of movie producers and actors. It showed how writers can give a pitch and have it either turned down at the spot or produced and directed into a Oscar winning movie. Robert Altman does a good job of showing the viewer the ups and downs to show business. From the fast cars, fancy clothes and only the best when it comes to dining out.

Besides the popular actors that popped up every now and then. The thing that really kept me watching the movie was the storyline. The suspense really builds up throughout the film. The postcards are a great example. I've never heard of this movie before watching it in my Film Study class. I thought it was really creative when Altman used the popular actors in show business to act as themselves. I also found it interesting that Bruce Willis played his little minor part for free. Altman does a really great job at showing the ups and downs of show business. The nice cars and money are examples of the ups of show business and then the threatening postcards and non stop phone calls for pitches and also unbalanced relationships with people are the downs.This is definitely a movie i would probably watch in the future when kickin back. I haven't seen many movies that have really given you a walk through a persons life thats involved with show business. An average person thinks Hollywood and movies are all fun and all about being rich and partying. After seeing The Player, you get the feeling that its not always fun and games, it can get really serious. Especially if you upset a hard working writer.I give this one a 7!",The Player
