0,bkoganbing,Russian back in style as villains,6,18 February 2014,"Tom Clancy's intrepid spy hero Jack Ryan is recast for a new generation in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Chris Pine who has already reincarnated Captain James T. Kirk for the big screen is now giving us a more youthful version of Ryan than we've previously had with Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin.The novel that introduced Jack Ryan to the American reading public is updated to current times as young Ryan who is pursuing a doctorate at the London School of Economics sees the World Trade Center come down on television. Like many he quits school and joins the Marines where his analytical abilities impress folks higher up. After surviving a downed helicopter in Afghanistan Ryan spends months in the hospital and meets the love of his life in therapist Keira Knightley. He also meets Kevin Costner who becomes his handler and recruiter for the Central Intelligence Agency.Pine's assignment is simple and unexciting. The CIA pays for him to finish his doctorate and gets him set up on Wall Street as a financial analyst. His job is to watch money come and go and where it accumulates. If that sets off terrorist alarm bells than he reports and the CIA goes to work.It takes until the present day for alarm bells to sound, but sound they do when he notices Russians buying copious quantities of US Treasury notes. That sets in motion an investigation of Kenneth Branagh, a Russian who seems to have done well in the new capitalist Russia, but also has memories of his country's humiliation in the late Cold War.More I won't say, but Branagh who doubles as director and villain is quite unforgettable as the Russian with a grudge. He's got quite a scheme involving a terrorist attack on Wall Street and financial panic resulting from same. He's even sacrificed his own family in the undertaking.It's interesting that this story which is only based on Tom Clancy's characters is having Russians as villains and is in theaters at the same time that the Sochi Olympics are on and that Vladimir Putin's government is getting world wide condemnation for its new pogrom like policies against LGBT people. A lot of people forget that Putin back in the day was a KGB agent and a player on a team that lost. He like Branagh's villain is a man likely to carry a grudge.Director Branagh directed a nice action film with some good performances from his cast. A far-fetched to say the least, but so were the events of 9/11.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
1,Leofwine_draca,"Acceptable, just about",5,17 January 2016,"JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT is the latest 'reboot' of a film franchise, in this case the Jack Ryan films of the 1990s and early 2000s featuring Harrison Ford and then Ben Affleck. This prequel instalment sees a youthful Ryan on his first case, tackling some financial terrorists in Russia.It's not a bad film per se, and as a time waster it's likable enough, with a good techno-plot and some thrills along the way. There's a stand-out fight scene early on in the proceedings which is by far the highlight of the whole thing and brings to mind some of the BOURNE greatness. Elsewhere, though, the plot feels tired and contrived and certain ingredients are poorly judged.Take Kenneth Branagh, for instance. His direction here doesn't really work too well for the thriller genre as he has little grasp of the kind of pulses that make audiences react. His Russian villain is as clichéd as they come, but there's a worse actor to come: Keira Knightley. Knightley is condemned to the usual 'wife' type role, but unlike THE IMITATION GAME, where she was very good and full of warmth, she's shrill and unbelievable here. That godawful American accent doesn't help, either.As in the STAR TREK movies, Chris Pine isn't bad at acting, but he has little of the natural warmth or charisma that makes an acting great. The opening ten minutes of this film are poorly conceived and all over the place and should have been excised entirely, and the stuff at the climax feels overly familiar and a little underwhelming by modern thriller standards. That 12 certificate doesn't help much either: these Tom Clancy thrillers should be tough, gritty, realistic, and with a hard edge, and few films are up to that balancing act.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
2,SnoopyStyle,Chris Pine is pretty good as Jack Ryan,7,10 January 2015,"Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) is moved by 9/11 to go from the London School of Economics to fighting in Afghanistan. His helicopter is shot down and he goes through intense rehab with med student Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley). Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) recruits him to work for the CIA. Jack gets a Wall Street job to find hidden terrorist financing covertly. Ten years later, he's at Harrman Brothers and living with girlfriend Cathy. He finds irregularities with the accounts of Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). He seems to be propping up the US dollar. Jack is sent over to Russia to meet Cherevin but the analyst is thrown into the deep end.I like Chris Pine's version of Jack Ryan. He is indeed a fish out of water. Keira Knightley has good chemistry with him. Kevin Costner is a bit stiff although he has the commanding presence. Branagh is passable as an evil Russian. In general, this is a good introduction to the character. However financial analysis is always going to be a hard sell and I don't buy the premise in this movie. It's the best that could be done with the material. It has a small bit of action. It probably suffers from being smaller than the other action thriller genre. Nevertheless, this is a good 90s thriller.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
3,Prismark10,A smart Alec,6,2 February 2019,"The character of Jack Ryan has never quite recovered after Alec Baldwin stepped out of the role after his initial outing.Ryan has went older with Harrison ford, younger with Ben Affleck and now a novice under Chris Pine.In Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit which is not based on a Tom Clancy story. Ryan (Chris Pine) is spurred to move from the London School of Economics to serve his country after 9/11.After serious injuries sustained in Afghanistan. He goes through rehabilitation, falls in love with his medic, Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley). Ryan also comes to the attention of Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) who recruits him to the CIA.Ryan is assigned a job in Wall Street as an analyst to look for any hidden terrorist financing. When he smells a rat concerning a Russian oligarch Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh.) Ryan is sent to Russia to audit his companies. Only to find someone is out to kill him.Kenneth Branagh who also directs, makes this a pacy thriller and jettisons that portentousness that infected some of the previous Ryan Films. It moves fast but it also makes the story shallow and forgettable.Pine plays Ryan like a puppy who is eager to please. Costner is the solid dependendable mentor. None of the characters make an impact.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
4,claudio_carvalho,Looks Like any Tom Cruise's Usual Flick,4,9 August 2014,"After being seriously wounded in Afghanistan, the Marine Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) is recovered by Dr. Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley) and they move in together. Jack is recruited by agent Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) to join the CIA as analyst infiltrated in Wall Street to check possible terrorist accounts and he can not tell that he works for the CIA even for Cathy. Three years later, Jack finds unusual movements in the account of the Russian Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). Jack is assigned to go to Russia with Harper to investigate Cherevin. Out of the blue, Cathy appears in his hotel room in the middle of a dangerous operation. Now Cathy has to be involved in the espionage game. ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is another absurd movie with a shallow story and the usual exaggeration. In this movie, the efficiency of the American secret service is amazing while Russians are depicted as stupid. The plot and the action scenes look like any Tom Cruise's usual flick, where he is the best agent of the world. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Operação Sombra - Jack Ryan"" (""Shadow Operation - Jack Ryan"")",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
5,nogodnomasters,I'M IN THE CIA,6,16 October 2018,"Lt. Jack Ryan has a helicopter crash and rather than create a 6 million dollar man, Jack goes into physical therapy. With the aid of Cathy (Keira Knightley) he goes from falling down with crutches to just about being able to fly. He is recruited by the CIA (Kevin Costner) to work in the finance industry. In that role he discovers that the Russians have some secret accounts and plan on collapsing the US dollar. Jack goes to Moscow, but it wasn't as much fun as when Bruce Willis went and destroyed every vehicle in the city, or the drama and suspense when Matt Damon visited. While there were some chase scenes and car crashes, much of the action takes place monitoring a computer. And seriously, do they actually pass envelopes in a movie theater? I would think the thumb drive pass that they later in the film was the way to go.Sorry Tom Clancy, but your characters were bland. Where was their sense of humor? The whole movie was about getting control over computer accounts to save the Treasury Bonds or something. For some reason my adrenaline rush level was low.Parental Guide: 2 F-bombs to make sure it gets a PG-13 rating. No sex or nudity",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
6,kosmasp,Don't hurt none,6,5 August 2014,"Maybe this should've been released closer to Jack Reacher. Don't get mad, I'm not comparing those too, but it might have helped this with its Box office a bit. It wouldn't have helped story wise though. Or movie wise if you will. And while this is checking many boxes, it never really achieves anything special. Keira Knightley looks good and you know where this is going with her. Even added ""dialog"" and some story concerning her does not really add much depth.Kevin Branagh has played in much richer roles, though he seems to relish the fact he can be bad in this one. And he has an accent (not British that is). Solid job as does Kevin Costner who also seems to bring some gravitas to it all. The ""origin"" story sounded nice on paper and has some charm, that's why this is not a total misfire (no pun intended), but it never gets really good to a point where you're like: I had to watch that",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
7,jboothmillard,Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,5,22 October 2014,"I knew the character created by Tom Clancy had appeared in four films previously, being played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford (twice) and Ben Affleck, but this film was interesting both being a reboot and not being based on a Clancy novel, directed by Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Thor). Basically following the 9/11 attacks, American London School of Economics student Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) fights in Afghanistan as a US Marine second lieutenant, when his helicopter is shot down his spine is critically injured, during a lengthy recovery, which includes learning to walk again, he attracts the romantic attentions of medical student Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley). He also gains the professional attention of CIA official Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner), who recruits him as a special operative analyst, and ten years later he has a cover job as a compliance officer at a stock brokerage on Wall Street, whilst doing so he searches for suspicious financial transactions that may indicate terrorist activity. Jack notices markets not responding expectedly following the Russian Federation losing a key vote before the United Nations, trillions of dollars held by Russian organisations he discovers have disappeared, and a large number of the funds are controlled by Russian tycoon Viktor Cherevin (Branagh), as auditor he has no access to certain accounts, this gives him reason to investigate in Moscow. Arriving Jack avoids murder by an assassin posing as his bodyguard, he finds his backup is Harper, during their debrief Jack explains that Cherevin's shadow investments could mean financial collapse for the United States following a staged terrorist attack, and global markets would weaken, Jack meets Chereven himself, he finds that he cannot audit because the Russian tycoon has sold all of his assets. Cathy, now Jack's fiancée, is concerned that Jack is having an affair, so she secretly flies to Moscow to meet him, to her great relief, and against protocol for unmarried couples, he reveals he is working for the CIA, and with improvised influence from Harper she agrees to assist in a plan to infiltrate Cherevin's offices. Across the street from Cherevin's office, Jack and Cathy meet the Russian tycoon for dinner in an upscale restaurant, Jack causes a scene and purposely insults his fiancée, and excusing himself he gains to access to Cherevin's office and computer where, while Harper keeps watch for and eliminates security, he downloads critical corruption files. It is discovered that Cherevin's son Aleksandr (Utgoff) is not dead, he is a sleeper agent, his death certificate was falsified so he could enter the United States, Jack uses his skills to locate Aleksandr and his target, Wall Street, he intercepts a a fake police response, and a vehicle chase ensues, with Cherevin kidnapping Cathy and giving chase. Following the chase Jack physically confronts Aleksandr, a bomb is planted in the police decoy, unable to defuse it he crashes the vehicle into the East River, the bomb explodes with Aleksandr killed inside. Jack and Cathy are reunited and discuss their future together, she decides to stay despite the risks of his career, meanwhile the Russian co-conspirators execute Cherevin, and in the end Jack, now married, joins Harper at the White House, called to brief the President. Also starring Colm Feore as Rob Behringer, Nonso Anozie as Embee Deng, Mighty Joe Young's David Paymer as Dixon Lewis and Gemma Chan as Amy Chang. Pine as the younger famous action man does a good job, Branagh does the perfect Russian accent and is likable as the creepy villain, Costner gets his moments as the hero's boss, and Knightley is okay in her part, the mildly exciting and tension filled sequences, specifically the hacking scene and speedy chases, are as good as you would expect, some of the script falls a tiny bit flat, but it is still an alright throwaway action thriller. Worth watching!",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
8,rmax304823,Decadent.,4,22 December 2017,"Not much to say about this episode in the franchise. Where ""The Hunt For Red October"" was suspenseful and well thought out, this one is rather boring. Chris Pine is neither Alec Baldwin nor Harrison Ford. The performance is a pedestrian one by a generically handsome young actor. The story begins with an ill-done action sequence in which Marine Pine is involved and horribly injured in a helicopter crash, just so we don't lose the action crowd right off the bat. He's recruited by the CIA and spies on some rogue Russians who want to obliterate the United States out of revenge for our having taken part in their defeat in Afghanistan. It would be nice if someone helped us out of our involvement now, after a decade and a half. The last third of the movie will be appreciated by any fans of the James Bond movies.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
9,ma-cortes,Thrilling installment in which CIA analyst Jack Ryan must thwart the plans of a dangerous financier,6,19 October 2014,"Exciting and moving prequel in which a young analyst , Jack Ryan, must carry out a risked assignment in Russia , there then goes into action ; being professionally played and directed by Kenneth Brannagh with a good cast such as Chris Pine as Jack Ryan , Keira Knightley and Kevin Costner .

Later on , as a young covert CIA analyst , he uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack and then he goes to Moscu . But his girlfriend Cathy (Keira Knightley, though Felicity Jones, Evangeline Lilly, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel were considered to play her ; however , Knightley was the early front runner and she ended up being cast) shows up and Jack has to tell her the truth about his undercover operation . Jack (at one point Ryan Gosling and James Franco were consider for the character, but in the end Chris Pine got the part) along with a ranking member (Kevin Costner) attempt to destroy a terrorist faction led by a magnate (this is the first time that Kenneth Branagh has played a Russian character), Cherevin company's owner , (whose logo clearly resembles one of Enron's drawing parallels between Enron scandal and Wall Street manipulation depicted in the movie) that threatens to induce a catastrophic conflict between the United States and Russia by detonating a bomb in New York City . Jack Ryan's entry with lots of noisy action , thrills , chills , tension and amazing thriller . This blockbuster is an acceptable adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to other prior renditions and it is first film in the franchise that isn't based on a specific novel in the Jack Ryan book series . Stirring outing filled with emotion , suspense , twisted intrigue and extraordinary nail-biting action scenes . This film is a prequel to the others in the Jack Ryan series . The 'Harrison Ford' films are direct follow-ups to The hunt for Red October (1990) despite the recast of Alec Baldwin's role . Therefore this film might be best understood as a reboot of the Jack Ryan series . Interesting screenplay plenty of twists , turns and thrills by David Koepp . The original screenplay written by Adam Cozad was entitled ""Dubai"" and was intended to be an action film starring Eric Bana. Paramount later asked Cozad to rewrite his old script and to change the lead character to Jack Ryan . Good production design , in fact , many scenes were filmed at the actual headquarters and adequate scenarios . The picture has a very good support cast who gives excellent performance such as Kenneth Branagh , Peter Andersson , Gemma Chan , Mikhail Baryshnikov and Colm Feore had a supporting role Sum of all fears (2002), the previous reboot of the Jack Ryan franchise starring Ben Affleck , he'd also played a main villain in Kenneth Branagh's Thor . Special mention to veteran Kevin Costner , he was actually the first actor offered the role of Jack Ryan Hunt of the Red October (1990), which was the character's first film appearance, but turned it down to make Dancing with wolves (1990) instead . Spectacular musical score fitting to action and suspense by Patrick Doyle . Colorful as well as atmospheric cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos , mostly filmed on location in Moscu , Russia . The picture was well directed by Kenneth Brannagh , though Jack Bender was originally attached to direct this film until he was replaced due to his commitment to work for another project . This blockbuster is an entertaining adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to ¨The hunt for Red October¨ by John MacTiernan with Alec Balwin and Sean Connery , followed by ¨Patriot games¨ (1992) by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford taking over the role of Ryan from Alec Baldwin and again ¨Clear and present danger¨(1994) by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford and Anne Archer as his wife . Then Harrison Ford dropped out of reprising the role of Jack Ryan because he and director Phillip Noyce could not agree on the script and Noyce ended up dropping out of the film as well . Furthermore , the prequel titled The Sum of All Fears (2002) by Phil Alden Robinson with Ben Affleck , Morgan Freeman , Bruce McGill ,John Beasley , Colm Feore and Philip Baker Hall . And finally , this Jack Ryan : Shadow Recruit (2014) , Tom Clancy's last film as a writer before his death on October 1, 2013 .",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
10,blanche-2,nothing special,6,29 August 2014,"Chris Pine, a young and attractive actor from the ""Star Trek"" franchise makes his bid for out of franchise movie stardom in ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,"" a prequel to the Jack Ryan series by Tom Clancy.Ryan is getting his degree in Economics when 9/11 hits, after which he enlists in the Marines. He is horribly injured in Afghanistan and spends months in rehab. His therapist is Cathy, who in later Ryan films is his wife.After his rehab, he is approached by a CIA agent (Kevin Costner) who wants him to take a desk job for the CIA after he finishes his doctorate. When we next see Jack, he has his degree, Cathy is his girlfriend, and he's undercover for the CIA while working on Wall Street. His assignment is to look for funding of terrorist plots through the finances of Russians.Ryan finds some strangeness in the account of a man named Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). He goes to Russia to investigate further. Cathy, sure he's having an affair because he's so evasive, follows him and surprises him in his hotel, putting herself in danger.Let's see -- derivative, predictable, with long car chases, violence, Internet hacking, and special effects. Jack Ryan follows the same formula used for any one of a hundred films.Chris Pine is likable but doesn't have the gravitas of, say, Harrison Ford, and Keira Knightley, for all her beauty, isn't much of an actress. Kenneth Branagh, who directed, is always a treat, and he's excellent here as the evil Cherevin.The problem with these films is that there is so little in the way of character development. They're like the old westerns, the good guys are good and the bad guys are evil through and through. Also dumb. And they're all about terrorism or getting a hold of a list of spies before the enemy gets them. There are enough plot holes in this thing to make a piece of Swiss cheese.

11,sunwarrior13,A Functional Action Film,8,30 June 2014,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is an action thriller that features an original story featuring Tom Clancy's most famous spy,Jack Ryan.Chris Pine,who portrays Jack Ryan,becomes the fourth actor to play the role.It also features Kevin Costner,Keira Knightley and Kenneth Branagh,who directed the film.The screenplay by Adam Cozad and David Koepp starts when it follows a young Jack Ryan,who was a student at the London Business School Of Economics.After 9/11 happened,he became a part of the Marines and made a tour of duty at Afghanistan.After he got injured from his military service,he was recruited to become part of the CIA where he became a financial analyst under the guardianship of Thomas Harper.While working at Wall Street,he was able to uncover a Russian plot that would collapse the U.S. economy.Then he becomes a covert spy at Russia to prevent the plot from succeeding and to stop another terrorist attack on U.S. soil.The film had a great beginning and an interesting premise considering that the U.S. is experiencing tough economic times.Added to that,we get to see another actor to portray Jack Ryan which provides an original and refreshing reboot of a dormant franchise.Unfortunately,the second part just fell apart as it resorted to commercial action movie that needed to earn money.While the story could have been better and the characters could have been given more depth,it became generic action film that fell one cliché after another especially when we just happen to see the typical ""Jack Ryan overthrow the Russians"" scenario all along in the end.It was just too bad that they weren't able to duplicate the quality of the previous Jack Ryan films such as The Hunt For Red October,Air Force One and The Clear And Present Danger.What's worse,it was not even as good as The Sum Of All Fears,whom I consider the worse Jack Ryan film before this was released.Overall,it just turned out to be a functional action film.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
12,LeonLouisRicci,Are Cold Warriors Still Relevant?,7,10 July 2014,"Kenneth Branagh a Shakespearean Friendly Actor/Director is Always an Interesting Filmmaker. His Dead Again (1991) is an Overlooked Neo-Noir that just Snaps with Style. Branagh is Behind and In Front of the Camera in this Modern Update of the Tom Clancy Cold Warrior.This is a Spy Movie of the Old School with Very Limited CGI as it goes for the Suspense Thing and does it Quite Well. It Moves at a Rapid Pace and has Enough Set Up to Reinsert the Character and the Today of a Wall Street Ticking Time Bomb.The Russians are Still the Bad Guys here and there is some Chatter about Afghanistan and how it Chews Up the Gung-Ho Kids of Superpowers. The Trio of Lead Alpha-Male Actors Chris Pine, Branagh, and Kevin Costner as a Military-Cia Veteran are all Called to Duty and Serve Admirably. Not So for the Female (Keira Knightley) and it Might be a Case of Miscasting but the Character (Ryan's Finance) Comes Off as a Toothy Whine and the Expression Never Seems to Change in Ever Changing Situations.Overall Die-Hard Action Fans may be Disappointed but this is a Refreshing Diversion from All the Overblown Stuff that Lands in the Multiplexes and Disc Machines.

13,utgard14,Unexciting and Lifeless,4,15 June 2014,"I've never been a big fan of the Jack Ryan movies, with the exception of Red October. The other three were okay but not really my cup of tea. The cast is fine here, for the most part. Keira Knightley's American accent is a little forced but nothing you can't overlook. For some reason, this is one of those movies where they don't wear much makeup. So in some scenes Keira looks like she needs a bath, Chris Pine's got razor burn and bloodshot eyes, and you could drive a car on the lines on Kevin Costner's face. This is the third movie I've seen in the last year that was like this. I really hope this isn't a new trend because it's not a good one. Who wants to see the pores and wrinkles on the actors? Trying to go for some kind of realism I guess. If they wanted realism, they shouldn't have included the part about Jack Ryan pulling two soldiers from a downed helicopter with a BROKEN BACK, I had to roll my eyes. Come on, movie. You want us to see how tough and heroic the guy is, why not do it in a less insultingly obvious way? And if that is in one of the books, I hope Tom Clancy wrote it more believably.Anyway, this is a pretty dull affair. The worst of the Jack Ryan movies that I've seen. Like I said, I admit I'm not a big fan in general so, if you are, take my review with a grain of salt. I just found the whole plot pretty boring and predictable. Not to mention the relationship stuff between Pine and Knightley a little hard to take, especially when it intersects with the CIA stuff. Plus the lack of makeup is distracting and unappealing. I can't recommend it to anybody because I was bored to tears. If they make another one, I hope they make it more exciting and do something about the faux realistic look because that just isn't working.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
14,view_and_review,Mini Van Tries to be a Sports Car,5,2 February 2015,"The Seattle Seahawks just lost the Super Bowl in the most unlikeliest of fashions so maybe I was in no mood to watch a movie. Why throw a pass at the one foot line when you have Marshawn Lynch??? He's Beast Mode! Anyway, I watched a movie to take my mind off of the horrific events on the gridiron and I wasn't too pleased with it either.Shadow Recruit is an average spy movie with many of your spy movie clichés. It's the same story different narrative. Chris Pine plays the CIA operative Jack Ryan. I mean, even the name is generic. Jack Ryan is conveniently close to Jack Bauer, Jack Reacher, Jason Bourne, James Bond, etc. I'm sure I'm missing some other spy ""J"" names. In this movie Jack has uncovered a terrorist plot from, in this case, Russia.So, what does a spy movie need? Brave and dangerous spy with fighting abilities. Check. Latest and greatest gadgets that operate faster than anything known to man and technology never seen before. Check. One or two tight wire situations. Check. A car chase. Check. Said spy putting all the pieces together in the knick of time to stop bad guy. Check. It followed the spy movie script faithfully. In this movie Jack was supposed to be going outside of his element to aid the mission, but he did it so flawlessly you would have thought he made the situation just so he could be the hero.The addition of Kevin Costner and Kiera Knightley didn't give this movie anymore validity. It certainly didn't make it any better. They, as well as the main character, were not the least bit compelling. I was never drawn into the drama that was unfolding nor was I drawn to any of the characters. The entire movie was bland. It was very mini vannish trying to be a sports car.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Kenneth Branagh both directs and plays the baddie.

Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that I thought this was a pretty good movie overall.

18,ferguson-6,Half Way,5,18 January 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Tom Clancy's spy novels have produced four prior movies with three actors appearing as Jack Ryan: Alec Baldwin in The Hunt for Red October, Harrison Ford in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, and Ben Affleck in The Sum of All Fears. While not based on a specific Clancy novel, this latest is a prequel clearly attempting to re-boot the franchise with Chris Pine as Ryan.Screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp have come up with an elaborate backstory beginning with Ryan (Chris Pine) as a university student so impacted by the 9/11 events that he enlists in the Marines. His heroic actions in Afghanistan and impressive recovery from injuries draw the attention of Kevin Costner's character who recruits Ryan into the CIA. Ryan is established as a genius analyst quickly rising through the ranks at his Wall Street firm.That entire set up is well played and quite interesting. A character who is believable as both a Marine-trained combat expert and a world-class financial analyst is borderline superhero stuff, so a fine line must be walked. Oddly enough, the big mission that Ryan falls into is actually reminiscent of the Cold War James Bond films. Foiling a terrorist act and a Russian plot to crash the US economy may be a bit far-fetched, but not if you have Chris Pine and Kevin Costner on your side! The best scene ... and most worthy of an espionage thriller ... takes place at a fancy Russian restaurant. Dining together are Ryan, his fiancé (Keira Knightley) and the Russian bad guy (played by director Kenneth Branagh). It reminds somewhat of the poker game between Bond and Le Chiffre in Casino Royale. Every glance and every word have dual meanings, and they all know they are being played. Unfortunately, it's this terrific little dinner that begins the downward spiral for the movie. The action sequences are just plain silly, and the car chases, tricked out surveillance vans, and all-knowing computer programs are just too familiar and tiresome to be effective.Kenneth Branagh has had an extremely diverse directing career with films such as Frankenstein (1994), Hamlet (1996) and Thor (2011). It's understandable that he would jump at the chance to re-ignite this franchise, but this genre is filled with high level competition - especially Bond and Bourne. So while it's entertaining enough for a January action movie, it's not at the level of the other franchises.Perhaps Chris Pine is a bit too ambitious. Already established as the new Captain Kirk in the Star Trek re-boot, he seems somewhat over-matched in the Jack Ryan role. His stunning blue eyes may rival those of Frank Sinatra, but his screen presence falls short of Harrison Ford.Three favorite pieces in this one are recognition for Manhattan's long time theatre Film Forum, a two scene cameo from ballet great Mikhail Baryshnikov, and the appearance of Peter Andersson as Branagh's head of security (he was the sleazebag case worker in Sweden's original The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). Kevin Costner states this is geopolitics, but I believe it is closer to Hollywood's desperation to recapture success instead of creating something new.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

The subtitle regards an undercover job for agent Jack Ryan who is recruited after his work in Afghanistan where he is shot down in a helicopter and spends a lot of time recovering from a back and leg injury. He is to go undercover on wall street where he targets a Russian terrorist. This has him trekking off to Moscow where he is attacked by everything including the kitchen sink. To add to the absurdity his nurse fiancée believes he is cheating and flies out to confront him thus adding more to the stupidity. Kenneth Branagh has directed a diversity of films from Hamlet to Thor. He screws this up in more ways than one. First off the ten year span from the opening scene is too crammed together with little if any feeling or involvement. It is all about the action and unfortunately there is nothing featured that we haven't seen countless times. It is about as exhilarating as a McDonalds big mack commercial. After Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck, Chris Pine would seem a great update but unfortunately his version of Jack Ryan is as exciting as a human phone book. Keira Knightley as his fiancée is subdued by the fact that the character is brain dead. Kevin Costner as a CIA contact is dull. Kenneth Branaugh as the villain is about as terrifying as a Care Bear. Colm Feore was once in Bon Cop Bad Cop and now he plays disposable cardboard characters in shitty films such as this. Pathetic action film junk should be backed over by a truck.

20,HotToastyRag,Great action flick,8,18 June 2017,"It's always hard, when you're the fan of an original, to watch a modern remake and give it a fair chance. If you loved Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan movies, I'm not sure how you'll react to this reboot with Chris Pine. I never saw the originals, so to me, this was a brand new action movie.I wouldn't call myself an ""action movie gal"" but I do enjoy the genre. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit earns a place at the top in my book, right up there with Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible movies. The action scenes are exciting, and between Kenneth Branagh's menacing Russian bad guy tactics and Kevin Costner's air of mystery, the tension keeps you hooked throughout. Also, usually in action movies there's some sort of comic relief. Sometimes the humor is stupid, but not in this one. There's a clever banter written in for the lovebirds, and it gives you a laugh without making the movie silly.Now, I'm the first to admit my bias, so here it goes: Keira Knightly is my favorite modern actress. Keira plays Chris Pine's girlfriend; even though she doesn't have a very big part, she is my favorite part of the movie and the reason I keep watching it. I mean, what man alive wouldn't go to the ends of the earth to keep her out of harm's way? Shadow Recruit is a really good action flick, perfect for a guys' or girls' weekend. And there aren't any sex scenes, so it's a great date movie, with eye candy for both of you!",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Ryan is working undercover in a bank, trying to find dodgy bank accounts. Finding one, he is sent to Russia, thus paving the way for Kenneth Branagh.he wants to start another economic meltdown, and submit a terrorist attack on American soil. Why does he want to do this? Because he's a dastardly scoundrel, and you know this is true because he beats up a nurse for no reason.A reboot of sorts, JRSR, takes us back to the thrillers of the eighties we all knew and loved, the ones where people would meet at the movies to give each other secret packages, and someone drops a bag in front of someone else, and people steal dogs to make them look normal, and this is where the film works well.Branagh can create a wonderful air of tension, and make technical jargon seem really interesting, making the viewer think that they are quite intelligent, it's the comfort food of cinema.But the big problem here is Pine. He just doesn't convince as Ryan, and at times he comes across as too immature to really make the viewer believe that his character will become the Jack Ryan we had in the nineties.I know he's a new recruit and all that, but he isn't focused on as much as you would expect, and it doesn't help when your acted off screen by Costner and Branagh.These two are the reason why the film holds so well, an old school villain, and an old school hero, take Ryan out of the equation, and this could have been an excellent cold war thriller ala No Way Out.But it's still a lot of fun. The set pieces in the restaurant and the film there on in is awesome, but it takes too much build up to get there, and as I've said before, Pine is a little bit of a wet blanket.Here's hoping for a spin off movie with Costner's character, but it's very doubtful.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
22,gradyharp,'You Americans like to think of yourselves as direct. Perhaps you are just rude.',8,13 June 2014,"Tom Clancy's durable creation Jack Ryan rides again in this well written (Adam Cozad and David Koepp) and well directed (Kenneth Branagh) new version – JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT. Previous actors Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck all contributed their own versions of this bright and clever and strong willed intrigue hero, but Chris Pine steps in now and may be the best choice for future incarnations of the character. He is a solid actor, maintains a boyish innocence beneath his bifurcated roles as a near PhD in Economics and as a CIA analyst. His supporting cast is essentially on target and together they make this one of the better Jack Ryan adventures to date. This is Tom Clancy's last film as a writer before his death on October 1, 2013.The film begins when Ryan (Chris Pine) was attending the London School of Economics and 9/11 happened. He enlisted in the USMC and was assigned to Afghanistan. His helicopter was shot down and Ryan saved his comrades but suffered severe spinal injuries that would require intense rehab: in rehab he is guided by 3rd year med student Cathy (Keira Knightley) and there is a definite chemistry. While there, he is noted by a man named Harper (Kevin Costner), who works for the CIA and would like him to finish his studies and get a job on Wall Street so he can find out of any terrorist plot through their finances. A few years later, Ryan finds anomalies in the accounts of a Russian named Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). Jack knows he should go to Russia to investigate his findings and Harper instructs him to tell no one, including his now live-in girlfriend Cathy. Cathy observes situations which make her doubt Jack's fidelity. Jack goes to Russia and Cherevin assigns him a Bodyguard (Nonso Anozie) but upon escorting Jack to his lush hotel room the bodyguard attempts of murder Jack and jack drowns him in the bathtub. Obvious Cherevin is hiding something so Jack goes to meet him, and he says he will bring his fiancé along. But Cathy shows up and Jack has to tell her the truth. Harper says Cathy has to go with Jack when she meets Cherevin. Jack doesn't want her to but Cathy says she's going. So the action begins that leads to the climax – a very fast paced, excellent chase and resolution.Other fine actors add to the story - Colm Feore, Alec Utgoff, Lenn Kudrjawizki, Mikhail Baryshnikov among many others. The urgent musical score is the work of Patrick Doyle and the cinematography is by Haris Zambarloukos. It is interesting to see how people are mentioning subjects like Keira Knightley's teeth and Chris Pine's complexion. Both are unrelated 'flaws' in this fine little film.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
23,gradyharp,'Trust. Truth. I think it's like most opinions - best unexpressed.',8,18 September 2018,"'Trust. Truth. I think it's like most opinions - best unexpressed.'
Tom Clancy's now famous character creation - CIA analyst Jack Ryan - has been through many transformations actor wise and the tales are uniformly engrossing and entertaining. In this 2014 version adapted by Adam Cozad and David Koepp the title role is assigned to Chris Pine who brings a fresh, young, somewhat laidback version to Jack's bright mind an allows his vulnerability to love and friendship to alter his manner of approach to deadly problems. For this viewer, the more human quality works very well - especially when comparing Pine's interpretation to the many other snarly similar characters that continue to flood the screens. Kenneth Branagh brings polish to the direct as well as to the 'other' important character of the story. Jack Ryan (Chris Pine), as a young covert CIA analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack. He begins attending the London School of Economics. 9/11 happens - he drops his studies enlists in the Marines, sustaining severe injuries when the chopper deploying him to Afghanistan is shot down. While in intense rehab, nursed by med student Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley), he grabs the attention of Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner), a man who works for the CIA and who would like Jack to finish his studies, get a job on Wall Street, and seek out terrorist plots through their financial transactions. Ten years later Jack finds anomalies in the accounts of a Russian named Cherevin (Kenneth Branaugh) and thinks he should go to Russia to check out what's going on. He's told not to tell anyone who he is, including his girlfriend Cathy, which makes her doubt his fidelity when she catches him in some lies. In Russia, Cherevin assigns someone to assist Jack, but when the two are alone, the man tries to kill Jack instead, so Jack kills him. Obviously, Cherevin is hiding something. Jack goes to meet him and says he'll bring his fiancée along, but the tables are not set for quiet dining but for further dangerous intrigue. Supported by a strong cast including Colm Feore, Peter Andersson, Lenn Kudrjawizki, Eleana Velikanova, Nonso Anozie among others, the pace is steady, allowing character development instead of just explosions and killings. The musical score by Patrick Doyle is mood enhancing and the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos is atmospheric. In all, this is a very fine 'JACK RYAN' feature - and it is sad that it did not do well in the theaters. Grady Harp, September 18",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
24,mm-39,"1 st half of Shadow Recruit worked, and second half fizzled!",6,23 January 2014,"The first half of Shadow Recruit worked, and the second half fizzled. The first half of Shadow Recruit was the story's character development. Chris Pine portrays and excellent Jack Ryan. Shadow Recruit explains who Jack is. Jack's personal character, and how Jack met his girlfriend Keira Knightley. Keira Knightley portrays perfectly the relationship side of Jack's life. Jack's girlfriend is smart, challenging, and creates relationship tension. Kevin Costner was Jack's mentor, who is a hardened veteran who understands the game and provides a wealth of experience. Regrettably, Shadow Recruit second half becomes a spy/Bond formulated movie. There is a evil villain with an evil plan, which results into a bomb countdown. If the viewer watched the James Bond series, like myself, he or she may find the ending anti-climatic and redundant. However, still a good movie. Six out of ten stars.

25,Mr-Fusion,"Pine's a good choice, but the story's way undercooked",5,6 January 2015,"Can't sugarcoat it, this was a disappointment. SHADOW RECRUIT does a pretty good job reimagining Clancy's hero for a post-9/11 world, but it's also got a lackluster economic terrorism plot with a few Bourne-esque fight scenes thrown in (you know the type: in-your-face with a jittery hand-held camera). I'm a Chris Pine fan, and I liked seeing his take on the role, and Costner's pretty good as the grizzled mentor, but Branagh did not make for a good bad guy. He's got the theater training to play up the menace, but it's not a well-written part, and he wasn't all that dangerous.I'd like to see more with Pine in the role, as he can carry Jack Ryan as action hero. Sadly, I don't think there's more in the pipeline.5/10",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

However I never doubted his ability to act and I believe Jack Ryan proves he is a decent actor.Jack Ryan is a CIA analyst, former Afghanistan military wounded in action. His cover is financial analyst for banks, but his real job is finding out money schemes that finance terrorism. Accidentally he finds out about a terror attack that is actually financial in nature and he suddenly becomes ""operational"", meaning he gets to kick ass.I liked that the character was very human, having an inexplicable physical stamina and tactical training, but other than that loving his girl, trying to do good for his country and being a little helpless without veteran and mentor Kevin Costner to back him up.Bottom line: it was a good action thriller, akin to Bourne and Bond movies. The bad guys were actually Russian, and not just some Russians, but members of the government, suggesting the start of a new media cold war via Hollywood. Well, they do a remake every 30 years, so why not remake the Cold War, eh? Keira Knightley's character was terribly annoying and the most heroic deed that Pine's character did was trying to marry her, if you ask me.

Just about everything in this movie has been done before and sometimes better. I don't know if it's because of the budget restraint (it probably was), but this movie bored me for over an hour which just seemed redundant and boring. I thought for a origin story of Jack Ryan I thought it just might pull off being something close to ""Casino Royale"", but it's far from that. It doesn't even really show how Jack Ryan became the super intelligent guy that works for the CIA. Instead it just jumps 10 years after just few minutes. I thought Kevin Costner made a good Thomas Harper, probably the best Thomas Harper portrayed in a movie so far. However the rest of the cast is easily forgettable, including the plot as well. There is just almost nothing that makes this movie stand out from the rest of the spy thrillers.

29,Hellmant,The James Bond franchise has had several missteps as well.,7,24 January 2014,"'JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fifth film in the 'Jack Ryan' movie franchise (and the first in 14 years) is a reboot now starring Chris Pine as Ryan. Pine is the fourth actor to play the popular Tom Clancy character (after Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck) and this is the first film in the series not to be based on one of Clancy's books. This movie tells how Ryan was first recruited into the CIA and met his wife. His first big assignment was apparently taking on Russian terrorists trying to cause a second Great Depression (in the US.). It was scripted by veteran film writer David Koepp and first time screenwriter Adam Cozad. Kenneth Branagh directed the movie and also plays it's main villain. It co-stars Kevin Costner and Keira Knightley as well. If this were the beginnings of it's own series it would be a little more impressive but as a 'Jack Ryan flick' it's kind of disappointing.The story begins with Ryan (Pine) as an Economics student who's motivated to quit school and join the U.S. Marine Corps by the events of 9/11/2001. He's severely wounded in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan and meets his future wife, Dr. Cathy Muller (Knightley), during his long recovery at a military hospital. He also attracts the attention of the CIA, due to his skills figuring out complex patterns, and is recruited by Thomas Harper (Costner). The movie fast forwards ten years when Ryan is now working undercover for the CIA as a stock broker on Wall Street. He's sent to Moscow on his first big assignment when he discovers a group of Russian politicians, lead by Viktor Cherevin (Branagh), are planning to crash the US economy and stage a terrorist attack. He also has to deal with Cathy not knowing what he does and thinking he's cheating on her. She comes to Moscow for a surprise visit. I think the movie is by far the weakest of the series but that's to be expected when a franchise hits the fifth installment. It doesn't help that it's not based on an actual Clancy story but also Pine is the weakest Jack Ryan yet. I like him in other roles but I don't think he's a good fit for Ryan (at least not the way he's written here, which may be the writers' fault as well). Branagh's directing isn't very impressive either (although he makes a good villain in the movie). What happened to him though, he used to direct good Shakespeare adaptations like 'HENRY V', 'HAMLET' and 'MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING' and now he does big commercial action movies like this and 'THOR'! The action and suspense scenes are decent but not at the level of the previous films, maybe because the characters aren't as well fleshed out and it's not as involving. Costner is one of the best parts of the movie as Ryan's mentor but the rest of the actors are mostly adequate at best. Decent but not as good as you should expect; the James Bond franchise has had several missteps as well though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny7Y7pgmZpA",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
30,Buddy-51,lackluster spy caper,4,19 February 2014,"Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") is the latest actor to portray the late Tom Clancy's signature hero, Jack Ryan, an honor that has gone to Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck in previous movie incarnations.In the latest, ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,"" which is an original story designed to reboot the series, our hero is an ex-marine turned undercover financial analyst for the CIA who discovers that the dastardly Russians are plotting to crash the dollar while simultaneously launching a terrorist attack on American soil.To no one's real surprise, perhaps, the skilled hand of the original author is sorely lacking in the Adam Kozad/David Koepp screenplay, which seems intent on resurrecting the old Cold War thriller genre in a post-Cold War world. For the most part dull and claustrophobic, ""Shadow Recruit"" suffers from a lack of credibility from the get-go. We're somehow supposed to believe that Ryan, who was severely injured in Afghanistan and who has been basically a desk jockey ever since, suddenly blossoms into a full-blown James Bond bad ass able to do just about everything short of leaping tall buildings in a single bound the moment he's confronted with some real danger. Even more outrageous is his girlfriend (Keira Knightely), a nurse who not five minutes after she learns her boyfriend of three years is a secret agent is smooth-talking a dangerous bad guy (Kenneth Branaugh with a full Russian accent) in a way that would put Mata Hari to shame in the femme fatale department.If Hollywood is truly serious about sustaining this legacy franchise without Mr. Clancy himself being around to keep feeding them fresh material, they're going to have to do a whole lot better than this.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

In fact, this movie is one of the most dead-even mediocre films I've seen in a long time. The movie goes from mostly cold – and slooow, to action – and just okay action. It just gets by.Introducing Dr. John ""Jack"" Ryan for a third time, or his second re-introduction, is really plain this time. Basically, a Marine that carries none of his training expertise with him when he gets brutally injured is recruited into the CIA because of just two papers he wrote a while back.Undercover, he uncovers a Russian stock market scheme which somehow makes the CIA think this broken man with a broken back the perfect spy to thwart the whole bad guy operation. Oh, well, they needed him to be the Jason Bourne/James Bond lite spy. And he was.Okay, Captain Kirk, er, Chris Pine does try to throw in some emotion into the character, but comes nowhere close to when Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford played the same character. (Just forget Ben Affleck's shot at Ryan – pretty much everyone else has anyways.)You could do worse, especially for a January release. When the action starts – much too late into the film, it's decent enough to not regret the movie ticket price.* * * Final thoughts: Hollywood needs to listen to me, i.e. my idea for a Trio of a Crossover: Jack, Jason and James.

32,Robert_duder,Jack Ryan does it again for me...a great start to 2014 films,8,23 January 2014,"I sort of planned for Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit to be my first official 2014 film. The trailers looked terrific and I am a huge fan of Harrison Ford's films and The Sum of All Fears reboot which was also excellent. Could they do it again? Yes you bet. This was Bourne, James Bond, 24, and of course Jack Ryan all rolled into one. If you love political thrillers, espionage, action, drama, romance...they managed to make everything work in Shadow Recruit. The film is a truly terrific reboot and much like The Sum of All Fears you have to remember that this is a complete reboot and has absolutely nothing to do with any prior Jack Ryan films and I'm okay with that. The film unfolds slowly but tells a complex story that has all the elements of a near perfect espionage tale. Tom Clancy would be proud. I'm honestly not sure every aspect of the story works but by the end of the film you're breathless and you are ignoring any potential plot holes because it is a thrill ride and an edge of your seat action flick with a very smart story. The first part of the movie is political and introduces us carefully to Jack Ryan. The middle and climax of the film you have a nail biting heist scene and then you're thrown violently into the middle of a killer action sequence to end off the film complete with the best explosion I've seen since Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol's Kremlin sequence.I realized mid-way through this film how much I actually enjoy Chris Pine. He might be one of the few really terrific young Hollywood stars we have right now who can pull off the sort of career and chemistry that stars of yesteryear have done. He is a great Jack Ryan. He shows that motivated intelligence and book smarts that Ford had but also embraces that kick-ass action hero side that Affleck showed (to a lesser degree.) Pine has a certain charisma on screen and he is just someone you root for. I wasn't sure how much screen time Kevin Costner would get in this film. He is one of my all time favourites (yes even through his slump.) I am pleased to say he has a MAJOR role in the film and he is outstanding. He is Ryan's mentor, he is like the aging spy who is still at the top of his game. He adds a distinctive edge to the film and to the spy game in general. This was Costner's best role in a very, very long time and he and Pine are terrific together. I admit I don't care much for Keira Knightley. I find her awkward and clumsy in almost all of her roles. The same could be said for this. She doesn't quite fit Pine and in the first part of the film you will swear she has ulterior motives (a plant or mole in Ryan's life) because nobody could be THAT needy and whiny when you're a world renowned surgeon. However, mid movie during the heist scene she sort of redeems herself and is far less irritating the rest of the film. Kenneth Branagh who plays double duty as star villain and director is both amazing and perhaps a negative in the film. Branagh is an amazing talent and I thought he was very good as the cold and brutal Russian mastermind. However, he is also a little campy in the role, a little James Bond Villain-esque and I also thought they tried too hard to make it clear how maniacal he was. A truly great villain is impressive because you feel how insane he is, not necessarily just because he blows someone away on a whim. Still Branagh is cold and calculating and has some truly disturbing scenes and makes a solid villain.As director though he truly nails this. I think he captures Jack Ryan to a T and yet still manages to update and reboot the franchise. You could watch The Sum of All Fears and then this one and I think you'd feel the style that is Jack Ryan but this stands on its own two feet at the same time. Its a complex, thought provoking, edge of your seat thriller that fans of the spy genre should just be jumping for joy over. I can't even remember the last time we saw a spy genre film of this caliber. While it has a very few mis-steps, this is truly a great night at the movies. I would love to see Pine and Branagh come back and do more!! A great start to the year for me. 8.5/10",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
33,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Impressive effort that scores far more hits than misses,7,10 September 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningUpdating the Jack Ryan character to modern times somewhat, here we have Ryan (Chris Pine) as a young man when the 9/11 terror attacks strike whilst studying at the London School of Economics. Compelled to make the world a safer place, Ryan enlists in military service, only to suffer near mortal injuries during a helicopter attack. Whilst struggling to recuperate, and beginning a budding romance with Cathy (Keira Knightley), the nurse helping him back to his feet, Ryan is approached by CIA hotshot Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner), who recruits him as a financial analyst. When he notices some unexplainable financial records in the file of Russian industrialist Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh), it sets him on the trail of a plot to launch a terrorist attack on American soil before crippling the United States economy.The late Tom Clancy's most well known and formidable creation, Jack Ryan, obviously enjoys enough of a cult following for this modern day update of his back story and adventures to justify it's existence. Which is just as well, as it ranks among the more cerebral and fulfilling of the more recent big screen adaptations. With Pine, the current go to man for filling the shoes of actors in the same role decades before, forming an effective leading man, and a vibrant mix of more modern and old school performers in the main roles, Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit is a slick, polished affair that scores far more hits than misses and serves as a sleek, impressive production all round.It might be a fair guess to estimate that Kenneth Branagh must be a fan of the books, crawling back out the woodwork after some time away to not only play the villain, but also serve on directing duties. Ken can always be relied on to pull off a professional effort when starring and directing, and if anyone had forgotten that, this assures a new generation of his competency. He's got every detail just right, right down to his fine Russian accent, as well as handling an intelligent, well thought out script that shines a light on the thin threads that hold our stability and democracy together in these turbulent, uncertain times, and all the work the government agencies must do to insure this. As much as the thinking man's action thriller as it is, somehow all the components to raise it that one benchmark higher to excellent aren't quite there, and there is not quite enough dynamism behind the hero and the villain and the end outcome to really get the emotions running. But in a time when any meaningless pap seems to do, this has to be admired for being a more solid , demanding adventure. ***",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
34,bowmanblue,"Seen it all before, unfortunately",6,19 June 2014,"Just in case you didn't know... 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,' is a reboot of the 'Jack Ryan' franchise which starred about three different actors as the titular spy during the nineties. This time, he's a younger incarnation, played by Chris 'Captain Kirk' Pine. Our new Jack works as an analyst for the CIA, but discovers a plot by the Russians to crash the US economy, therefore he's shipped off to Moscow to sort things out.Naturally, things don't go to plan (and that's just his personal life!). For he leaves behind his long term girlfriend, Keira Knightley, who, naturally, hasn't got a clue what he does between 9-5. Therefore, poor little Jack has to balance keeping her in the dark, while saving the world. Does that sound familiar? It should. It's been done a hundred times before. Sometimes it's been done better. Sometimes not. How many times have you seen a spy/hit-man/killer struggle to keep his better half in the dark regarding his murky profession? How many times have you seen the hero have dinner with the baddie before they finally square off? How many car chases have you seen? There's not an awful lot wrong with Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Its major flaw is that it's been done so many times before and there just isn't that much new here to get excited about. Everyone plays their parts well and there's action and stuff. But, if you're into action and/or spy movies, then you've probably seen better and worse. If you're really desperate to watch yet another international spy movie then you could do worse. It's just that if that's what you want to watch then you've probably seen better as well.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
35,ThomasDrufke,Similar to Basically Every Other Action Film,5,29 June 2014,"To say this movie is basically a copy to all the Bourne films is an understatement. But to say I didn't have at least a little fun with it, would be a lie. There are certain aspects of the film that are okay, but for the most part it's just a bland January release. The trailers are somewhat misguiding but I think that helped this film. Kevin Costner was built up to be the big bad guy after the inevitable spy thriller twist that happens in almost every movie.I think Chris Pine is good in the role but isn't as memorable as Matt Damon or Tom Cruise as Bourne and Ethan Hunt respectively. Those actors made their roles huge, whereas Jack Ryan was already a tough sell and Pine didn't do much to help. Keira Knightley was actually pretty bad in this role. I typically like Knightley in everything she does, but this go around just didn't work. Could be because her incredible accent wasn't present or because her American accent was terrible. If you take her character out of the film, the story doesn't really change much at all. But I will say at least this film didn't use the shaky camera and/or the impossible events that ruin a movie.When you first see Chris Pine struggling walking after the accident, I had hoped that the movie would be about him overcoming his difficulty and saving the country. While partially true, it just wasn't the character that I hoped. I wanted to root for him more than I actually did. Branagh also seemed like that warm up villain in a Bourne movie killed in the first scene, not a big baddie. Things tend to wrap up a little too easy in the movie as well. A movie is suppose to get you on the edge of your seat and witness the unexpected. I didn't do that once this entire film. Give Chris Pine another shot with a great director and you could have a B+ action thriller. The characters are just too similar to give this movie a fresh review.+Chris Pine is a future star -All too similar -Characters are uninteresting 5.2/10",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
36,MLDinTN,Russia is trying to destroy the US economy...,5,7 October 2014,"and it's Jack Ryan to the rescue. I hate it when movies keep recasting a character and keep making him younger and younger. Any ways, the movie starts with Ryan in a helicopter and he's injured and that's how he meets his soon to be doctor wife. He's recruited to be a secret agent and work in the financial sector. He gets wind of secret Russian accounts and goes to Moscow to audit. There he uncovers a secret plot by the Russians to destroy the US economy. He escapes a murder attempt and meets up with his secret contact. Now most of the suspense is about computers and downloading data, I thought rather boring. Then Ryan's girlfriend shows up and ends up helping. They go back to the US and for some reason he is the guy after the terrorist. You'd think FBI already in New York could have handled it plus he had that long plane ride back to the US. But Ryan saves the day.FINAL VERDICT: The plot was sort of boring with all the computers and would Ryan be the hero in New York when he still has to get there from Moscow. I would think other agents could have done it. Any ways, not a great ""action"" flick. I'd skip it.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
37,g-bodyl,Jack Ryan: Modern Adaptation!,8,4 February 2015,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is the fourth Jack Ryan to hit the big screen and the first one to do so since 2002's The Sum of All Fears. I thought this modern-day adaptation was a solid one, even if it doesn't soar as high as the first three films. The action is good and there is always a fast pace to the film. The script is merely okay, but the acting is passable even if some accents were a misfire. It was good to see this popular character back on the big screen. Kenneth Branagh's film is a prequel of sort. After 9/11, Jack Ryan is wounded in Afghanistan and his doctor ends up being his fiancée. Jack is an analyst who also works for the CIA. His mission is to go to Russia and prevent a bigwig criminal from destroying America's economy via terrorism. I thought the acting was decent. Does Chris Pine live up to Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford? Perhaps not, but he is just as good or even better than Ben Affleck. He brings a sense of freshness and young masculinity to his role. Keira Knightley did a good job, but she should have never used that dreadful American accent. Kenneth Branagh is good as the villain and Kevin Costner makes a welcome return to the big screen as Jack's CIA mentor. Overall, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a decent action movie which is pretty impressive for a January release. I found it entertaining which is good enough for me, good enough to erase the flaws from my memory. I may not remember in the film that much in years to come except that I liked it, so there is that. A well-paced action thriller this is. I rate this film 8/10.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

I popped it on the shelf and promptly forgot about it. I was reminded I had not watched it, when Chris Pine made the headlines when he was asked about the possibility of a sequel to this film. The star answered ""No. I don't think it made enough money for that to happen. That's one of my deep regrets, that we didn't totally get that right. It's a great franchise and if it's not me, then I hope it gets a fifth life at this point. It's just great. I love the spy genre.

Chris Pine makes for a good Jack Ryan (though Harrison Ford will always be my favourite) and Kevin Costner is always reliable, and here is no different. Despite delivering a perfectly entertaining spy movie, Kenneth Branagh delivers a dull, weak villain and a career worst performance. I also found Kiera Knightley's accent distracting, and think she put so much effort in to it, as her performance suffered as a result. Random fact, Kevin Costner was actually the first actor offered the role of Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red October (1990), which was the character's first film appearance, but turned it down to make Dances with Wolves (1990) instead.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

We can say it is something like that, but not a heist movie, though the law enforcement theme. As usual, it is the good guys (Americans) versus the bad (Russians, sometimes Germans). After the successful movie 'Thor' I did not expected a movie like this from the director. It is like falling back to the average, I thought he's better than this. This movie was a nice entertainer though had few problems in some areas.The movie kick starts with the real incidental disaster attached to the opening scene. And then moves into a few years later where the regular story begins. The movie focused only three main characters plus a villain and fails to recognize others around them. Jack Ryan is an Afghan war veteran who is recruited by the secret force official Tom Harper. He believes it is an easy job and honoured to serve his country. After sometime the role of his duty completely changes. Now he has to fight back from a Russian power hand in order to save himself. While advancing everything it goes faster and drag in the people around him he love. Can he successfully pull off the mission is what the grand ending reveals.The cast was not bad at all as well their performances. The equal amount of action, drama and thriller kept the movie get going at a constant pace. But I was really bored for half of the movie. I did not find any freshly innovated scenes with this altered story of many other movies.

The film has more intrigued and although there is some shaky camera action, it is more top notch. Still in ways, this film isn't that great but as a whole was more so average and mildly entertaining, Chris Pine being one of the main reasons for it.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
46,eddie_baggins,Enjoyable if forgettable action thriller,5,14 January 2014,"Kenneth Branagh is a better actor than director, that's a stone cold fact; as Viktor Cherevin in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit he steals every scene he's in with a menacing stare, enigmatic character background and imposing presence. His choices behind the camera however, as well as the writing talents of Adam Cozad and David Koepp, and acting skills of leads Chris Pine and Keira Knightly leave much to be desiredThe story of Lieutenant in the Afghanistan War turned financial analyst for the CIA Jack Ryan, who happens upon a Russian terrorist plot not dissimilar to 911 to begin a new Great Depression in the USA and with his mentor William Harper (Costner) travels to the Motherland to bring Cherevin and his diabolical plot down, can basically be summed up as a rapid succession of clichés accompanied by the most annoying screen couple this side of Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale in Pearl Harbor. As the titular hero and Tom Clancy creation Pine isn't terrible per se, in fact his roguish charm does elevate a number of scenes where levity is needed, but with her utterly irksome smile, lack of subtlety and grace and terribly underwritten/unimportant role the awkwardly strung Knightly outstays her welcome after a mere 5 minutes, before hanging on for another 100. The experienced heads of Costner and Branagh can only do so much, and if you feel a sense of hope and anticipation when the great character actor David Paymer (Drag me to Hell, Quiz Show) makes an appearance, dash it immediately, as he is allowed only one brief scene in which to make an impact.Oh how this could have been better if Knightly stuck to her romantic dramas have I mentioned that already?Despite all of these glaring negatives however, I do believe that there is an audience for this film. Fans of action and tales of conspiracy will no doubt lap up the contrivances here, and mounting unbelievability brought on by endless coincidences (the main villain has an obsession with obtaining married or engaged women, a miniscule bit character's motorcycle is important at just the right time and you have to love Cathy's expert spotting of the photo of Wall Street that the expert agents around her all dismissed), and the pace retains solid movement throughout, even when the audience is subjected to what seems like endless incomprehensible talk of markets and buying and selling something-or-rather in order for whatever to happen. 90% of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is exposition, and the remaining 10% is horrible.Ultimately, surprisingly and perhaps hypocritically however I left the cinema having enjoyed myself. This is not a good film, but its plethora of issues are equal to that of any Steven Seagal or Jason Statham actioneer, and as it's problems are in the same mould I could never take it any more seriously than I would a straight to disc shocker, thus eradicating any disappointment I would have otherwise felt. Will I willingly pay money to see the expected sequel? Not a chance. Am I glad I got to attend an advance screening with my friends? Sure; as the great Randal Graves once said (well, the gist of it anyway): ""I hate people, but I love gatherings isn't it ironic?""Predictable, unfathomably silly and needlessly complicated, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is not a promising beginning to a new franchise, but with its pro-US propaganda and attractive leads one gets the impression it doesn't particularly matter what I think.2.5 Napoleon references out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

48,leonblackwood,Average action thriller! 4/10,4,8 June 2014,"Review: The director really tried to make a Mission Impossible/Bond type movie, but he really didn't pull this one off. The storyline had loads of chances to bring in some twists and turns, but it was a basic goodie vs. baddie type movie with Chris Pine trying to take out the corrupt Russian who was played by the very English Branagh. Branagh also directed the movie, which was a surprise because I expected something with a bit more substance from the Shakespearean actor. Anyway, the whole movie is very average, with a couple of action scenes which wasn't that amazing. Watchable!Round-Up: It looks like Kevin Costner is getting better with age because I like him in the movie. Keira Knightley's role could have been played by anyone and Chris Pine just seems to act the same in all of his other movies like Unstoppable & This Means War. I did like him in the new Star Trek movies, but I think that is mostly down to the director who has rebooted franchise. Judging by the money that this movie made, I'm sure that they are going to bring out other Jack Ryan movies in the future so I hope that they give some other directors the chance to make a better movie.Budget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $135.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there action/thrillers about a CIA agent trying to stop Manhattan getting blown up by a crazy Russian. 4/10",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
49,TheMovieDiorama,Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit spies on Bond to replicate aspects and become re-Bourne.,5,3 February 2020,"Clancy's series of intense novels involving CIA analyst turned operative Jack Ryan have had several adaptations in the past. A film franchise that suddenly, after 'The Sum of All Fears', became dormant for over a decade. With cinema evolving and experimenting with action sequences, Jack Ryan had seemingly retired from fieldwork, unable to compete with the big boys. Then, a reboot was commissioned. This reboot, to be exact. Having no relation to any of Clancy's existing work. An original story that had no limitations. The end result? Meh. It's fine. But much like a shadow, it disappears in the nightfall of Moscow. After a spinal injury during Operation Enduring Freedom, Jack Ryan is recruited as a CIA analyst only to then be brought forward as an operative to uncover fraudulent behaviour from a Russian tycoon who seeks to collapse the American economy.Actor/director Branagh proves he is a versatile talent. From tackling classic Shakespeare to whimsical Marvel productions. The thespian is a, and please do excuse the pun, Jack of all trades. Directing a plausible central scenario that feels apt for the modern financial climate. It's not a case of constant combat for the sake of having two guys throw fists at each other, there is some intelligence buried within. An imminent financial collapse after a staged terrorist attack on Wall Street is credible, and Branagh's sleek direction consistently places this scenario at the forefront.The problem however, is Ryan's transition between analyst to operative. The first half of the feature showcases some dedicated character development for Ryan and his fiancée. A barbed relationship weighed down by Ryan's career secrecy which Muller convinces herself is actually participating in an affair. Then, Ryan goes to Moscow without any real explanation, because apparently he is the only person best suited to job. And gradually, with each passing minute, the spy thrills become more generic and less engaging. His first kill, despite having no training in fieldwork, is against a hitman double his size. Then, after confronting the sinister Cherevin in his lavish office, Muller decides to conveniently fly herself to Moscow to challenge her fiancé over the accused adultery. Unfortunately, she comes across as the most needy individual ever, likening Knightley's usual prowess to a mere object. The CIA then involve her (let's be honest, they wouldn't) and it just becomes an absolute mess. Seamless infiltration leads to a mediocre car chase which then leads to the climactic punch out.Each narrative stepping stone is executed to the most precise calculation, yet lacking genuine thrills. Several edited scenes were messy and obviously had no relation to the previous location, most notably the exploding van. However, Pine's committed central performance was enough to level out these prominent errors, even if his tense face exudes a constipated look and thus further distracting me. Knightley's talents were offensively wasted, and Branagh's heavy Russian voice resembled a mediocre pantomime villain. He's no Vladimir Putin, let's just say that.As a reboot, Shadow Recruit didn't exactly tear down the Kremlin with its tour-de-force spy shenanigans. Yet it's not terrible in the slightest. Jack Ryan, much like the man himself, is fine. Enjoyable to watch, but utterly forgettable the next day.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
50,Turfseer,"Sometimes on the 'edge of your seat entertaining', but the verisimilitude of its plot is lacking",6,25 August 2014,"Although 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' is based on the character created by the late famed mystery writer, Tom Clancy, the screenplay here was written by Adam Cozad and David Koepp. It stars Chris Pine, who is much more notable as James T. Kirk in the new Star Trek reboot. Here, Pine has the requisite good looks for Jack Ryan but most of what he does is 'by the numbers'. It takes a while before the story (or should I say action?), picks up. Initially, we're treated to Ryan's back story—how he first was attending the London School of Economics when 9/11 occurred and his subsequent elevation to derring-do as a second lieutenant during the Afghanistan conflict. He ends up with a spinal injury when his helicopter is shot down but manages to save two of his comrades in arms. Ryan must recuperate from his injuries and is nursed back to health by his future wife, Cathy Muller, a medical student. Finally, Kevin Costner arrives on the scene as Thomas Harper, who recruits him for a 'numbers cruncher' job with the CIA.Things continue to plod along as Ryan works as an undercover compliance officer on Wall Street until he discovers that trillions of funds belonging to Russian organizations, most controlled by a shadowy Russian tycoon, Viktor Cherevin (Branagh), are now nowhere to be found in the bank's computer database. It's off to Russia where the first good scene begins, as Ryan is almost taken out by one of Cherevin's bodyguards who poses as his driver who picks him up at the airport. When Ryan ends up drowning the fake driver in the bathtub at the hotel, that's one action scene to remember.The rest of 'Shadow Recruit' involves a great deal of suspension of disbelief, if you want to enjoy what you're watching. Right away it seems a little too easy the way in which the CIA cleans up the mess at the hotel. But hey, this is the movies, isn't it? I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to Wall Street machinations, so the plot Cherevin has devised to ruin the US economy, also seems quite far-fetched (sell all your shares on the market, coupled with a terrorist event, and that should easily spell the next Great Depression for the United States). I also wish that the film's scenarists explained in a little more detail what was on those computer files that Ryan so expertly downloaded in the nick of time. I do know the way in which Ryan is able to avoid Cherevin's security to break into the office next door, seemed pretty unbelievable.Nonetheless, things are flying at a pretty brisk pace after Ryan manages to escape from Cherevin's offices. The car chase, though pretty standard, still keeps one engaged along with Keira Knightley, stalling for time with Cherevin at dinner, and later a kidnap victim, about to have an exploding light bulb stuffed down her throat by an over the top Branagh, as the brutal Russian oligarch (Knightley's part picks up as she has little to do at the beginning of the film, where she ends up popping up in Russia as a mere jealous spouse). Then there's the climax of the film featuring Cherevin's son, who was planted in the US years ago and is now a trained assassin. The brutal way in which he dispatches various innocents, he encounters, has the ring of verisimilitude. The way in which his identity is uncovered, however, by a series of hunches on the part of the principals involving social media (as they try to figure out the plot inside a jet headed back to the US), plays more like an advertisement for Ancestry.com, than a more detailed peak at how covert CIA analysts really work.No need to give away the details of 'Shadow Recruit' ending, but suffice it to say that the good guys of course win in the end. I don't wish to be too hard on 'Jack Ryan' as it doesn't always make a lot of sense, but once Ryan arrives in Russia, it does seem to pick up steam and manages to entertain to a certain extent. The best way to enjoy 'Jack Ryan' is with a box of popcorn—extended viewings don't seem really necessary, given the plot contrivances. In the end 'Ryan' entertains but it's useless trying to analyze everything in detail—one must leave that to a real-life CIA operative, analyzing a real-life case in point.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

He quits his studies to join the US Marine and serves in Afghanistan but is wounded whilst on duty. Ryan ends up getting recruited into the CIA by Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner), making him an analyst and work undercover at Wall Street, getting him to find any funding of terrorism in the markets. In the present day Ryan discovers a series of trades by a Russian client and suspects a Russian Oligarch with a vendetta against the Americans, Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh) is planning a wipeout of the American economy and force a Second Great Depression.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a fast paced, but very average thriller. There a strong espionage skullduggery moments like when Ryan having to call the CIA after killing an assassin and Ryan infiltrating an office with the support of a CIA support in a race against time. The plot is loosely similar to Tom Clancy's novel where a vengeful Japanese tycoon also forces an economic clash in the United States: but the film is more believable as the novel's plot is America and Japan go to war with each other in the mid-90s.The let down for Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is the action. It is disappointing, using shaking cam and is cut way too quickly. The best action sequence is the first when Ryan has to fight off an assassin and being his forced into a battle for survival for him. You saw the struggle on Ryan's face but the fight ends up talking place in a bathroom and it ended up reminding me of the beginning of Casino Royale to the point of plagiarism.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit does have a good cast. Branagh and Costner were both the strongest performers as the villain and the mentor roles respectively. Branagh does a convincing job portraying menace whilst giving a strong Russian accent. Costner who grounded and believable as Harper, supporting, guarding yet manipulating Ryan into becoming a field agent.Pine is solid in the lead role and he does show his range as we see the pain on the face when he kills, something he thought he would never have to do. Pine also gets a moment to be his trademark jerk persona and he is convincing in the action despite how poorly it was done.Knightley did provide a strong American accent and she was a likable presence throughout the film: but she was in the film to be the damsel in distress.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a perfectly serviceable thriller that is watchable, but it is not particularly memorial film as it attempts to do for the Jack Ryan what Casino Royale did for Bond.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

It is also the first movie that is not based on a specific novel from the series, it's more of an origin story. There have been four other films about the Jack Ryan character; The Hunt for Red October with Alec Baldwin, Patriot Games & Clear and Present Danger with Harrison Ford and The Sum of All Fears with Ben Affleck.

This story sees a young CIA operative Jack Ryan sent to Russia by his mentor Harper to stop the Russians from destroying the American economy and cause the second great depression. The character Jack Ryan is a big part as I mentioned before and I think Chris Pine did a really good job in the role as he does the best thing a lead in a spy thriller can do, he combines the realistic relatability of the character with the great action he does in the film. The support cast is also really good with Kevin Costner doing a fantastic job as the mentor of Ryan, Harper, and for me he was my favourite character in this film. Keira Knightley plays Ryan's unknowing girlfriend and she does a really good job in this role and her chemistry with Pine is good and provides a good core of the film. Director Kevin Branagh plays the Russian villain and he does a decent job in the role providing a good counter to Ryan thus giving a good confrontation. Now the story is a huge disappointment with the plot basically being so simple and generic it is unreal and the plot of this film is not why you watch this film. The script is okay with the dialogue being mostly decent but sometimes some of the scenes didn't seem to hit their mark. The style of the film is okay but once again like the story it seems a bit generic with not a huge amount of uniqueness to it. This is an okay spy thriller that if you don't see it you shouldn't be too disappointed.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
57,Chris_Docker,In the right hands it could almost haver been good...,4,2 December 2019,"Kenneth Branagh has directed some incredibly powerful and faithful adaptations of Shakespeare. Ms Knightly has drawn rapturous praise for portraying the simpering airhead. Neither, sadly, are appropriate for a high octane poor-man's Mission Impossible. As for Mr Pine, the script hardly does him any favours as he hops miraculously from one impossible situation to the next up waves of top Russian hit squads. He's about as convincing as a C.I.A. operative as he was as a Captain Kirk. - which is not at all. Jack Reacher: Shadow Recruit is a trite copy of the standard counter-intelligence film and a rather poor one at that. Honestly fellers, stick to what you're good please, at and save the rest of our more discerning audiences the price of the admission ticket.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
58,estebangonzalez10,"Jack Ryan doesn't offer anything new, but it's still entertaining",7,31 January 2014,"""You're not just an analyst anymore, you're operational now.""The most famous and beloved CIA analyst, Jack Ryan, is back for the fifth time although now it's Chris Pine's turn to interpret the hero Tom Clancy first made famous in his novels. Pine brings a fresh and charismatic presence to his character's reboot. By no means is Shadow Recruit groundbreaking or memorable, but it still is a lot of fun and engaging. I was actually surprised I enjoyed it so much considering January releases are usually weak, but knowing that Kenneth Branagh was behind the camera did give me some hope. Jack Ryan slowly builds the tension and ends with a thrilling and gripping 30 minutes. There are many weak and clichéd moments, but for the most part I was entertained. The supporting cast was also strong and Branagh played a decent villain, but my favorite performance was Kevin Costner's. The film's major flaws have to do with the way the plot was developed since there were many scenes where two characters are explaining the situation going on to each other and it's evident the scenes were only included so the audience could understand what was going on. But beside those forced scenes, this thriller managed to keep me entertained and I thought Pine was a convincing Jack Ryan.We are introduced to Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) while he's studying at London School of Economics, but after the 9/11 attacks he decides to enlist and serve in Afghanistan as a Marine. During a routine mission his helicopter gets shot down and he's critically injured. As he undergoes rehab he meets Dr. Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley) and the two begin a relationship. Jack also attracts the attention of CIA agent Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) who decides to reclute Jack for his ability to recognize complex patterns. Harper convinces Jack to return to school and complete his Ph. D so he can become a broker in Wall Street and work undercover as a compliance officer looking for suspect financial transactions. Ryan discovers some suspicious activity involving a Russian organization through a fund controlled by Viktor Cheverin (Kenneth Branagh). For this reason Ryan travels to Moscow to investigate Cheverin's company and upon his arrival he isn't greeted too well. This is where the action and espionage games begin.Chris Pine is a very charismatic actor; he proved it during the Star Trek reboot, and now he has done the same thing with Jack Ryan. He's also starred in other entertaining action films like Unstoppable alongside Denzel Washington holding up his own. Here he delivers once again playing a very convincing Jack Ryan. I actually enjoyed him more than Ben Affleck who played the same character, and despite not reaching the high standard set by Harrison Ford, I still thought he was great. Branagh is also a pretty bankable director and I enjoyed what he brought to this film. Jack Ryan may be a forgettable film, but one that manages to entertain you while you're at it.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
59,lukem-52760,A GOOD SPY THRILLER WITH A GOOD LEAD IN CHRIS PINE,6,5 May 2020,"I'm starting to become a Chris Pine fan & can understand why Quentin Tarantino has said that Pine is his favourite of the ""Chris's"" (Pine, Hemsworth, Pratt & Evans) all guys are good in their own way & each has made some excellent films each & all have their own fans.
Chris Pine still feels the most underrated & low-key of the bunch in my opinion as he pops up in lots & even leads films like the new Star Trek films & is a main lead in the Wonder Woman films & held his own next to Denzel Washington in the fantastic Thriller, Unstoppable & has obviously made alot more but Pine still doesn't feel ""Big"" like a huge movie star as the other Chris dudes seem much Bigger!!!
But Pine is a fine leading man & is very good here as Jack Ryan in this slick action Spy Thriller, now this film isn't on the same level as Harris Ford's 90's original Classic's but it's still a good movie & entertaining.
This is more an origin story for Jack Ryan & how he ended up working as an Analyst for the CIA & Pine is very good as the character & i genuinely like the guy as an actor & here he's got the beautiful Keira Knightley as his love interest & plays opposite the great Kenneth Branagh in a Russian villain role, who also directed this & it's a shame this flick bombed as a sequel would've been Awesome, also the great veteran actor Kevin Costner stars as the guy who wants to recruit Jack Ryan.
Jack Ryan has some good slick action & thrilling scenes that makes it a nice little thriller that's not over the top.So far Pine has been best in Tony Scott's runaway Train Thriller Unstoppable but he's usually good in whatever he pops up in & does solid work in most films.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
60,3xHCCH,"Oddly Familiar, Yet Still Very Exciting Thriller",7,15 January 2014,"Jack Ryan was a young Marine who was injured during a mission when his helicopter crashed. Upon completing his therapy for his injury, Ryan was conscripted by Thomas Harper to be an operative of the CIA because of his keen analytic acumen specifically in economics and finance. 10 years later, while working in Wall Street, Ryan uncovers some suspicious transactions by a Russian firm which may spell economic disaster Stateside. Ryan goes to Moscow supposedly to do some auditing work. But upon his arrival, it was apparent that this mission was not only going to be about punching numbers into a computer.Because of his previous work in ""This is War"", I knew Chris Pine could play a very good spy. Though Pine did not really look like he had a PhD degree, and a lot of his financial talk just flew over my head, his action sequences were very gritty and exhilarating. He also has great chemistry Keira Knightley, the actress who plays Ryan's charming fiancé Dr. Cathy Muller. Her suspicions of an affair unexpectedly gets her involved with Ryan's dangerous mission.It was good to see Kevin Costner back on screen in a substantial role again. He was older of course, but still looking good. His character Harper may feel like any other mentor/supervisor role in other espionage films, but Costner played him very well. Too bad he was not really given any special moment which can be considered really memorable.The villain of the film Viktor Cherevin though was another matter altogether. Kenneth Branagh creates a strong antagonist with his subtly sinister portrayal of the Russian businessman with terrorism, economic and otherwise, on his mind. He completely transformed into his role very convincingly, with no trace of British-ness.This particular Jack Ryan did not feel like this was going to be the same man in the other older films where we knew the character Jack Ryan first, like ""Hunt for Red October"" (played by Alec Baldwin), ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" (played by Harrison Ford) or even ""Sum of All Fears"" (played by Ben Affleck). This film only has the character Jack Ryan, but in a story NOT written by the books' author Tom Clancy at all.This film had an oddly generic feel like we have seen this story in some form before. Even if this was set several years post-9/11, it had that dated Cold War (a la classic James Bond) feel especially when the action shifted to Moscow. Fortunately though, despite those gripes, ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is still a very exciting action-packed thriller. The director is also Kenneth Branagh, whom we usually associate with Shakespearian productions. He follows up his mainstream directorial work on the first ""Thor"" film with this one, with much skill. The camera work was excellent especially for the gunfights and car chases. That sequence of firm infiltration was very astutely edited with much tension, impossible as that could have been in real life. It was Branagh's energetic story-telling and Pine's charismatic portrayal as Ryan that turned the potentially mediocre script around and created a really effective and entertaining spy thriller, successfully rebooting the character for a possible film franchise. 7/10.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
61,TdSmth5,Great action thriller,9,9 August 2014,"Some American economics student in London joins the Marines after 9/11. He ends up in Afghanistan. While he's in a chopper it's hit by a missile and he ends up with broken vertebrae and unable to walk. Back in the US while he's undergoing therapy he falls for his therapist, a med student. He's also being watched by someone who's in the CIA and eventually recruits him. He'll have to finish his studies and get a PhD in economics, and start working on wall street looking for terrorists financial transactions. Years later, he's together with the now doctor. The Turks plan a pipeline through their country which would put Russia out of business. Ryan discovers some secret transactions so his handler sends him to Russia to audit the company involved.In Russia, the guy who's there to pick Ryan up starts shooting at him at the hotel but Ryan manages to kill him. It's the first time he's killed anyone. As he meets the sinister boss he's told that all accounts have been sold so there's nothing to audit anymore. That forces the team to find another way to get into the accounts. Ryan magically figured out that the accounts relate to a terror attack and that Russia will dump its dollars as soon as the attack takes place. So he has to break into the bad guy's office to download info, while his girl dines with the guy. He off course is alerted by all this activity and advances the timing of the plot and now the team has to figure out where the attack will take place and who the terrorists are.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is an excellent polished international action thriller. The movie is fast-paced, perhaps too much so during the the final act in New York. It has a rich story and is very well directed, not to mention that it has strong performances by the entire cast, but especially by Branagh. If there is a problem, it's the casting of Pine. He can act, but he just doesn't look the part. He doesn't look like an economist, or a CIA agent, let alone a marine. And he's not the kind of actor you can connect with. You do connect with Brannagh's villain though and you do care about the story and its resolution.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
62,aharmas,It works for the most part,8,19 January 2014,"From what I read in the credits, this is based on the characters created by Clancy, and it seems to have the right idea, and a very talented writer to set the basis for it. Chris Pine has done great work as Kirk in the ""Star Trek' newest reincarnation, and I was a bit hesitant to accept him in this new role. Then I thought if Harrison Ford had managed to embody three or four of cinema's most interesting action characters, Pine had at least a good chance. Pine does very well in live interviews and is a decent actor, very charismatic. Ford is great on screen even though he's not the most exciting interviewee. The premise might work.Then I saw that Brannagh would helm the picture and costar in it, with a little help from another interesting actor, Costner. He started as the double-spy in ""No Way Out"" and did well. There's a dark side to him, so I figured he would do well as CIA operative. The film seemed to be moving well.""Shadow Recruit"" has Pine working as financial CIA agent who discovers some rather covert manipulations of the market. He knows he has to travel to Moscow in order to set things straight. Somehow it was never explained to him that he might have to face bullets, race cars, and endanger his life. After a brief introduction which lets us know how he is recruited and gives us a bit of moral background, Pine is off and running all over Moscow, facing the film's archenemy, his fiancé, and some really bad traffic in Moscow.The film has good pacing, and the effects are pretty decent. Yet, there is a bit missing the target. It might be the underdeveloped villain, and the whole complicated situation which combines the financial maneuvering with the possibility of very lethal damage to a big metropolis. It works best when our hero tries to avoid elimination, or he's trying to stop someone from hurting him or his wife.It's a January film, so there might not have been much expected from it, and if it develops into its own franchise, it has a strong likelihood it will succeed. Pine has very good chemistry with his co-star. I hope they come back.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
63,s3276169,Propaganda or Entertainment-You decide,1,23 July 2014,"When I heard Kenneth Branagh was directing the latest Jack Ryan outing I had expected great things. Branagh is a fine actor and has some reasonable directing credits behind him. I was wrong, oh so wrong. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit is a lobotomized, one dimensional, clichéd proposition, that skirts the boundaries between drama and propaganda. All of the characters without exception are one dimensional. The US hero is spotlessly ""heroic"" and the Russian villains utterly ""villainous"". More troubling however, is the stereotyping of Russia as the home of cynical ""economic terrorists"" whilst the West is painted as a virtuous victim of Russian conspiracies. For myself I had a hard time deciding if this was entertainment or a propaganda plug for the US/UK alliance currently locked in a political spat with Russia. Big thumbs down.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
64,AudioFileZ,Left Wanting So Much More For Ryan...Clancy As Well.,5,8 May 2014,"This movie, at least to me, stumbles right out of the block. To build the back-story of Jack Ryan we're forced to pictorially revisit 9-11 from kind of a distance and we get it that Jack was compelled to enlist. I can't put my finger on it, but when I read Clancy 20-+ years ago this immediately seems at odds with what the writers were updating the character to? It gets worse, Ryan is in no short order seriously wounded. He can't walk in any conventional sense, but in short order he's running. Folks, this ain't eloquent character building here. It feels like the ""hurried-up"" super-saver version. Seriously, I'd rather be plopped simply into a after recruitment Jack Ryan doing something compelling.It does seem refreshing to have our old arch nemesis, Russia, back in place of homeless Middle Eastern zealots. The story isn't half-bad where Russia attempts a much more worldly ""power- grab"" the likes we haven't seen since the Cuban missile crisis. So, the actual core story here has good legs. But, in the unraveling of that story there's holes galore and tension that never really gets to the point you're on the edge of your seat. This movie just ""almost"" gets you really invested, but it simply doesn't turn that crucial corner of ""good enough"" and believable enough.Chris Pine is a decent enough young Ryan, but Costner, other than his immense screen like ability, infuses nothing vital into the character of Ryan's handler. Really, I can't tell if the director wanted this detached performance, or if Costner just didn't have his heart in to it? Costner is seldom, if ever, bad, but he's sleepwalking here. I was going to avoid this, but for some reason I keep thinking about it. Ryan was a lot less interesting because of his love interest in the movie instead of it being the other way around. Keira Knightley just didn't create any chemistry that was compelling, basically she gets in the way and isn't memorable. Finally, there's those sometimes pesky plot holes. Ryan has to go to Russia just because his bank's biggest investment partner has made all of their joint investments locked down to where Ryan's bank can't see what's going on? How delusional is this? Either the bank is in on it or the bank wouldn't partner up blindly, especially with Russia. Not to mention Ryan dispatches (i.e., kills) the guy who picks him up at the Moscow airport even though he's not expecting to be attacked by a physical specimen twice his size packing a gun. I want my Jack Ryan to be more believable and more intellectual, not a physically challenged ""superman"".I didn't mean to go on as long as I did, but I did watch the entire movie and was, intermittently, entertained. It's not by any means bad (however I wouldn't call it too good), it just never reaches the level it aspires to. Bottom line: It doesn't do the Jack Ryan character justice. James Bond (a much more iconic character to be sure) has been restored. Clancy's Ryan has been whetted down and slung into a bit of a hole. Hope, if they revive the character someone gives it the intellectual push it deserves and whoever continues the role fits. Pine is decent (I'll say it againmeaning not superb), but wasn't given the best palate here to paint Ryan.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
65,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,5,4 September 2014,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is the fifth film in a series that features actors Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck, Alec Baldwin, and now Chris Pine. After viewing this January release which is one you might forget about the moment you leave the theater, I was slightly reminded of a James Bond movie. Here's the thing: I was reminded of a lousy James Bond movie. So for the record, let's just call this Bland, Jack Bland.Even though ""Shadow"" is the fifth and latest installment, it reverts to being an original story separate from the Tom Clancy novels (of which the earlier films were based on). It has been unleashed into theaters just months after the similar themed Paranoia. That film (coincidentally starring Jack Ryan alum Ford) was a huge disappointment. This Kenneth Branagh directed lark, is only slightly better. With a short running time that renders it vastly underwhelming, and containing not one plot twist despite putting that notion out in the trailers, the proceedings begin with an introduction to the events of none other than 9/11. Jack Ryan (Pine) is living in London as a college student and sees the horrific images mentioned on TV. He then decides that he wants to save the world (why not) so he enlists in the U.S. Marine Corps to serve in Afghanistan. After getting severely injured in combat, he winds up in a hospital, meets his future wife (Keira Knightly as Cathy Ryan), and is watched by an admirer in CIA agent Thomas Harper. Harper played by Kevin Costner, persuades Ryan to finish his PhD and eventually work for him on Wall Street (Pine's character uses his smarts to suspect terrorist activity). Things get hairy when Jack gets involved with a creepy Moscow investor named Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh casting himself as the villain and harboring an incredibly silly Russian accent). From then on, the plot and the sporadic chase sequences/fistfights are set in motion.Also set in motion, are the actions of one character in particular who doesn't have a lot of dialogue, but seems to be more charismatic than anyone else. He is unknown actor Alec Utgoff and plays Cherevin's son. He is a sleeper cell agent who hides out in Michigan until he is activated to carry out a devious plot. He plans on bombing the entire area of Manhattan's financial district while his father simultaneously initiates financial trades that will bring down the U.S. economy. As Aleksandr Borovsky, Utgoff says almost nothing. However, he's quietly menacing and exudes a heck of an amount of screen presence.Now Branagh did direct the successfully suspenseful Thor so maybe he decided that it was time to helm movies of this genre for many years to come. To his credit, he does stage action scenes in a decent manner that someone who never saw a Jack Ryan movie, would be okay with. But it seems like there aren't too many camera setups or believable stunts here. As a result, nothing comes off as groundbreaking or challenging. When I think of action directors, Paul Greengrass, John Woo, and Walter Hill come to mind. When I think of Woody Allen collaborators and Hamlet, I go to Branagh. That however, is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what's wrong with ""Shadow"". Chris Pine, so debonair and sleek in the Star Trek reboots, suffers here when he's forced to carry a whole movie without a huge cast surrounding him. He's neither believable as a rough and rugged butt kicker nor is he credible as a spy. Yeah he's got movie star looks, but he comes off as wooden and stiff. And it doesn't help that he trades laughable dialogue with his love interest played by Keira Knightly. Oh and speaking of Knightly, she swaps her British accent for an American one and as a result, looks and acts as if she has a mouth full of cotton. Then there's supporting player Costner, who piggybacks on his role from his earlier work in Man of Steel (he's starting to project the whole quiet, calming, engaging vibe). He does an okay job with his limited minutes on screen. But you wonder why he is always watching Pine do all the work while he just sits there in the background. Besides firing a gun a few times in one scene, Costner doesn't have a lot to do. And don't forget, he doesn't have a PhD like Pine's Ryan so his role is disposable and somewhat unnecessary if you will.All in all, ""Shadow"" is by no means an awful film. But like I mentioned earlier, it's the type of familiar PG-13 hokum that leaves your brain the moment after you view it. Right from the get go, things open up with an annoyance of obligatory spy themed music (lots of violin work with a sped up tempo) and an abundance of computer gimmickry forcing me to call this thing the quote unquote, ""laptop movie"". There's a lot of computer mumbo jumbo going on not to mention a slick, shiny feel when it comes to the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos (it's souped-up glitter without a pulse). And even though certain types of moviegoers might get a kick out of all the high tech stuff, what's on screen ultimately, is bland, lifeless, and to a huge degree, sterile.Certain movies stay with you long after you see them. You pick up certain subtleties and see something new or fresh every time. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit sadly, does not possess this trait. Lacking any sort of intrigue (at 1 hr. 45 minutes, how can it), it's not a distance runner, but rather a dogged, 40 yard dash. Therefore, I don't plan on ""recruiting"" anyone to see it.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
66,p-stepien,Branagh plummets,4,30 June 2014,"Jack Ryan (played by revamped Captain Kirk Chris Pine) is an ex-marine with apparently genius level intellect, who after retiring from active duty becomes part of covert CIA operations in the financial markets. When he digs up odd dollar purchases for a Russian billionaire Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh), he alerts his comrades and is soon sent to Moscow to dig deeper into the evil conniving plutarchs of the ex-Soviet empire. He soon becomes a target for contracted hit-man and a part of an ensuing world-saving operation to stop impeding doom. His only hope is experienced field agent Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner apparently filmed this during lunch breaks on the set of ""3 Days To Kill"", still even wearing the same clothes). Meanwhile he must also meander between a personal crisis with his fiancée Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley), who suspects Ryan's second life has to do with infidelity...Why film a Jack Ryan movie that apparently isn't even based on any of the Jack Ryan novels? Haven't read any, but with such a bold move you had better deliver a well-wrought compelling intrigue to back up your decision. As it stands Kenneth Branagh unfortunately delivers a talkative meandering story, which attempts to recreate some of the best of the Bourne franchise, but fails to create the urgency or intrigue to make it truly work. This is all structured around an absurd plot, which for some unknown reason necessitates a terrorist attack to precede a financial meltdown.The movie suffers from a chaotically absurd pulp storyline. But whats worse the planning behind the attack ventures into imbecillic with spy mistakes piling up to a level unheard of. In such circumstances, Jack Ryan is always a step ahead of the moronic, saving the day by calling the stupid. Whereas the build-up manages to hold sway, despite the overly long background introducion to Jack Ryan (and moronic plot point of pulling people out of a burning helicopter with a broken back), it loses hold once all the pieces are put into play ending in a cat and mouse chase between dumb and not as dumber.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
67,bob-rutzel-1,"Bland, but Okay",5,11 June 2014,"Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) is recruited and joins the CIA as an analyst. Looking through terrorist trails of money, Jack sees something that is not right with an account by a Russian named Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). If Jack is right, this Russian could bankrupt the United States. Oh, oh!Since prequels weren't doing the job it has been decided to go back to when our hero first joined the organization. Well, except for the Star Trek prequel. We'll just have to live with it in that other dimension. A reboot for the Jack Ryan saga was out because we need to stay in this timeline. See?This was okay, somewhat bland, but okay. No real tension or suspense except when Jack has to sneak (I always get nervous watching someone sneak into something to steal something while trying not to get caught) into a Russian office to copy information regarding Cherevin's plan to destroy the US and it's currency. The catalyst for all this is a bomb detonation. So the team of Jack Ryan and Tom Harper (Kevin Costner) have their work cut out for them. But all is taken in stride and we know everything will be okay. No worries.Why this was loaded up with so many clichés is a mystery. Costner grooved on them. Were the writers on a break? What could have helped were some twists and turns. Didn't happen. Kenneth Branagh who played bad guy Russian Cherevin also directed this movie. He was okay, but wasn't menacing. He should talk to Clint Eastwood about how to act and direct in the same movie.This could very well have been a made-for-TV movie and it played like it was. Not bad, but not that good either. Bland, bland, bland, but okay. Get it?An aside: The setting was mostly in Russia. I keep waiting to see those chandeliers in subway cars that I keep hearing are there. No one in these Russian setting movies I watch rides the subways. Bummer, but I will keep an eye. Watching Chris Pine I kept seeing a young William Shatner and, of course, a young Captain Kirk. Look closely. There is a resemblance. Honest. So this tells me that we need the Star Trek enterprise (get it?) to engage (get that one too?) again.

68,Luigi Di Pilla,Entertaining Jack Ryan Thriller,7,2 January 2015,"A solid execution of my well appreciated Ryan series. Completely placed with new leading actors. The terrorist story is still actual with real espionage elements. Interesting to see how agents are observed and discovered from the FBI and so on. All the running time offered suspense and I was never bored. Director Kenneth Branagh proofs here that he is able to create a countdown bit nailer thriller. Would be great if he continue to stick other Ryan movies as this one. Next part I would like to see another enemy nation. I am tired looking always Russian as the bad guys.

I don't know what to make of this movie. it's just a pile of clichès upon clichès. If you've watched one movie from the espionage/action genre then you've already watched this film. The storyline started rather unique and interesting until it turned into the clichè stop-the-terror-attack-in-the-last-second toward the end, and of course the protagonist will save the day in a last-second-save style of course!!!The action sequences are good and fun but it could've been more than that with better editing, Acting is fantastic tho, Chris Pine brings his A game, and is the saving grace of this movie. Kenneth Branagh makes a good 'Russian' villain and the rest of the supporting casts are so-so. The score does it best to complement the scenes but still end up short, the cinematography and effects are satisfactory.

70,Troy_Campbell,Utterly forgettable,5,18 January 2014,"In 2002 the underwhelming The Sum of All Fears - with Ben Affleck in the lead role - put the Ryan franchise in the morgue. 12 years on and the famous CIA analyst is back on the big screen with a brand new story and a fresh face. Perhaps they should've waited another dozen years, as this reboot is utterly forgettable and offers nothing in the way of originality or inventiveness. The action has no pulse, the plot is straight out of 1980 and there's no thriller element to keep you guessing as the ""Trust No One"" tagline on the poster would suggest; which is all a shock when you consider Kenneth Branagh was at the helm and his last effort Thor, was such a gleefully entertaining motion picture. It also doesn't help that the latest incarnation of Jack Ryan, as portrayed by Chris Pine, has about as much charisma as a tree. Keira Knightley, Kevin Costner and Branagh are serviceable as love interest, mentor and villain respectively, however there's little any of them can do to boost the excitement levels. It's not a bad movie per se, just a run- of-the-mill affair you'll struggle to remember after the end credits.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also acted in the film, The Shadow Recruit had lot of potential to create an impact but is diluted by amateurish direction which you will not even remember after leaving the theater. As I said earlier, action scenes should be engaging and provoking but is weak and average. Screenplay is decent, Barring few scenes, the film does not boast off any significant performances by the lead cast. Chris Pine does okay as Jack Ryan but could have been better.

Like use the name Jack Ryan and do something worse than what they did with James Bond after Pierce and totally ignored Tom Clancy's work utterly backstory included... I only watched this because it was in a 5 movie set. Can I have that back on and Ken, really can't make a bad guy look bad. He keeps coming off as a nice guy.

73,brchthethird,Surprisingly good throwback action film with a modern sheen,7,14 November 2014,"While it isn't particularly spectacular, JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT is a worthy successor to the previous entries in this series. Here, Jack Ryan is played by Chris Pine and the story is about how he uncovers a plot to crash the US economy. Sure, that might not have the same edge as good, old-fashioned terrorism but for what it is, the film delivers a tense and thrilling experience. Other cast members included Keira Knightley as Cathy Muller, Ryan's girlfriend/fiancée and Kevin Costner as Harper, Ryan's CIA handler. All of them give good performances, even if their characters don't have too much depth. The lone misstep in casting was Kenneth Branagh, who cast himself as the villain, Viktor Cherevin. While he did put forth a good performance, his accent was kind of hammy and he didn't really add anything new to the stereotypical Russian villain we've seen dozens of times before. As far as action is concerned, it was OK. There wasn't a whole lot of it, but it was mostly shot well. The only scene I didn't particularly care for was a fight towards the end which had a lot of shaky-cam. Overall, I was slightly disappointed in what I got because the trailer had me thinking there would be a lot of duplicitousness, when the movie actually turned out to be rather straightforward. Still, it was entertaining enough and is something I might consider adding to my Blu-Ray collection.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
74,maurice_yacowar,young marine joins cia and prevents US economic collapse,7,4 February 2014,"After directing five Shakespeare films — and a dozen others — in Jack Ryan, Shadow Recruit Kenneth Brannagh proves his deft hand at the commercial thriller. It works. In fact, there are so many thriller set-pieces you don't notice there aren't any sex scenes. They include a war-time shelling, love blooming in dramatic rehab, a high-tension nocturnal office invasion, a lavish car chase, a sewer chase and fight, several hand-to-hand combats and shoot-outs, a high-tech office tower chase, and the hero's rescue of his kidnapped lady just as she's about to have a vapour lightbulb — energy efficient — rammed down her gullet. But the real thriller set-piece is more cerebral — the CIA uses a mass of computer-stored details about everyday citizens to track down the Russian sleeper in quiet Pennsylvania.In this prequel to the Jack Ryan franchise young Jack (Chris Pine) is equally jock and genius. Both physically and mentally he shows amazing stamina and ingenuity. The evil Russians' scheme involves the same combination of material and abstract, a terrorist bombing of Wall Street coupled with a massive sell-off of American money to destroy the economy. Aptly, the CIA saves the day by accessing a web of stored minutiae. There lies the film's political thrust. When scads of massively irrelevant info are mined for patterns the happy ending proves the necessity for all that spying the government has been doing even on private citizens, in the US and beyond. This ultra-modern deployment of numbers contrasts to the old-fashioned secret meeting at the old film, Sorry, Wrong Number.The American right wing will feel justified in its government's snooping because here it works. Ryan's mentor, the welcome back Kevin Costner, dissociates himself from his government's water boarding but happily — and fruitfully — works the unchecked spying. The liberals will enjoy seeing their lad Brannagh succeed in a popular genre. So Shakespeare doesn't rot your mind and narrative skills after all. But it's the right that will find this film most reassuring. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
75,classicalsteve,Decent Action Flick But Nothing Special--Branagh as the Baddie was the Best Aspect,6,25 January 2014,"I guess we so-called Generation X'ers like more plot and story than just pure action, unlike our Millenial counterparts. This film seems more targeted to the action crowd than the audience who wants to see an intricate plot and a compelling storyline. While there are a few good things in this film, such as Branagh as the baddie and an interesting seduction scene between him and Keira Knightley as Jack Ryan's heartthrob, the film never quite pulled me in. At one point, the plot takes a pretty good turn where the baddie seemed to have the upper hand but that was all too brief. Thereafter, I guessed where the film was going.The plot is rather complex but underdeveloped, which is part of the problem with this latest installment in the Jack Ryan Canon. The story begins with Ryan (now played by Chris Pine, the most recent Captain Kirk in the latest Star Trek films) during his salad days as an economics PhD student at a university in London during the 9/11 attacks. After serving his country and being injured for his troubles, he is then recruited by the CIA via Thomas Harper, played by Kevin Costner. Ryan is to pretend he's a typical trader on Wall Street, but in secret he's investigating off-shore investments which might be funding terrorists group. Through an analysis that takes only minutes on-screen, Ryan discovers trillions of dollars in secret accounts which he traces to some kind of business magnate, Viktor Cherevin, played with nice understatement by Kenneth Branagh.Unfortunately, for my taste, we really don't see how Ryan was able to penetrate the accounts so fast. He just flips on his laptop and finds a whole bunch of inaccessible accounts and immediately knows what they are. I really wanted to have a much more developed sequence where he looks for clues and follows leads. After about 5 minutes of screen time, he's flying to Moscow to confront Branaugh. At the same time, he is living with the woman who was helping him in the hospital. However, she doesn't know he's secretly working for the CIA. And then Costner ends up in Moscow to help Ryan, and then lo and behold, the girlfriend ends up there too and the race is on with lots of car chases through Moscow and then in New York.Overall, a modestly entertaining but for some reason not entirely satisfying action film. At no point in the story does the baddie ever get his way or achieve any of his goals, except for one action sequence about 75% of the way into the film that is way too short. And I liked Branaugh as the vain and soft-spoken baddie, the way he should be. At a certain moment, one of the people in his organization scolds him because of his weakness for booze and broads, which was one of my two favorite scenes in the film but like most of ""Shadow Recruit"", the good scenes were all too brief. There is also a young baddie of Russian extraction now living in America as a double-agent, but very little about him is developed except a biography which is recapped for about 30 seconds. The script needed about 2-3 more rewrites before it would have been there. Essentially about 80% action and only 20% story development. I wanted more interesting scenes, not just piles and piles of car chases. A one-watch at best.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
76,Andy-296,Awful movie with a beyond terrible script,2,23 January 2014,"The reboot of the Jack Ryan franchise (not based on any particular book, but starring the character invented by the recently deceased Tom Clancy) is utterly disappointing. As the movie starts, we are in 2001 and Jack Ryan (a wooden Chris Pine) is studying economics in the London School of Economics. News of the terrorist attack of 9/11 prompts him to enlist as a marine. Next we see him, he is fighting in Afghanistan, where his helicopter is blown off, surviving miraculously. The CIA becomes aware of both his academic smarts and his courage in the military field, so they bring Kevin Costner to enlist him for the agency in a unit fighting financial terrorism. To do that, he is asked to work undercover in a Wall Street firm. There, he learns, perhaps a few years later, that one Russian oligarch named Victor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh who also directed the film) is involved in some shady dealings, so he has to go to Moscow to investigate. As it turns out (warning: spoilers ahead), Cherevin fought in the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan during the 1980s and is still resentful that at that time the US supported the Afghan Mujahedin, which eventually defeated the Soviets. His plan for payback to the US: buy really huge sums of dollars in the market, and sell them when a terrorist attack hits the US. This would cause, according to Ryan, a collapse of the dollar and ""the second great depression"". Russia, however, will be fine, since it has ""all the oil"" (Ryan has apparently never heard of the shale oil revolution that has enormously boosted US oil production). You don't have to be a Ph.d. in Economics to realize that such scenario is utterly ridiculous: the US economy is six times larger than that of Russia, and the notion that a Russian oligarch has so much money he can corner all the dollars in the world is beyond laughable.Branagh is fine as the villain and shows some flair directing action sequences, but there is only so much he can do with such an execrable script. By the way, this is probably the first Hollywood movie to show the Russians as villains since Rambo III from 1988. Keira Knightley is pretty as Ryan's witless wife. Mikhail Baryshnikov has an uncredited cameo as a sort of Russian bureaucrat in cahoots with Cherevin (for those with memories, during the 1980s he starred in a Cold War drama called White Nights, that was about as awful as this movie).",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
77,PartialMovieViewer,It Would Be Better Without the Jack Ryan Moniker,4,20 July 2014,"'Jack Ryan' is a pretty fast paced flick and, yes, there is a smattering of intrigue dribbled here and there. I only wish they would let the 'Cold War' warrior rest in peace. Jack Ryan was about the best thing Alec Baldwin ever did. No matter what one may think of Mr. Baldwin, he was the consummate Ryan. I have watched the other post-Red October movies, and no other Jack Ryan portrayal cuts the mustard. Chris Price is OK, but not worth one back-flip. I really believe Chris is better suited as Captain Kirk. As I said in the beginning, there is plenty of action, but the running and racing cannot hide the painfully dull disconnect between characters and audience. I don't know if it is the cast itself or maybe the silly plot. Yes the plot. It appears this whole storyline of some kind of financial intrigue solely contrived to slap the 'Jack Ryan' stamp on it - at the same time, not ruffling any international feathers. I guess it lacks spine. This is an OK flickjust not stellar",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
78,phubbs,Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,5,13 June 2014,"Well this looks like a reasonably slick espionage mov...BANG! REBOOT! ugh! Yep Ryan's back in the fifth film of the Tom Clancy novel adapted franchise that really did seem like it was dead in the water. But guess what! this time they have abandoned the Clancy stories completely and gone with a fully original idea that just happens to be yet another fudging origins tale...Jesus H Christ! another flippin' origins reboot.So we see how Ryan starts off his career, becomes a marine, gets badly injured, meets his future wife and finally ends up working secretly for old man Costner blah blah blah...its all of no importance. Bottom line Ryan is working as a covert CIA analyst and trying to snoop out suspect money transactions that could lead to terrorist attacks. Low and behold he finds one! a suspicious looking operation that stereotypically leads him to Russia where he must bring down the evil Kenneth Branagh with lots of hi-tech jiggery pokery.What can I say? the entire cast of this film felt completely miscast in my humble opinion. Kenneth Branagh directed this film and conveniently gave himself the meatiest role as the main bad guy. The problem is whilst Branagh can do a marvellous Russian accent he can't really pull off the bad guy spiel too well and comes across as trying way too hard with his dastardly cool as ice persona. I get the feeling he's been watching Alan Rickman in 'Die Hard' too much, watching him slap his men around just came across as funny. Pine as the main protagonist Ryan was always coming across as 'Kirk' to me quite strangely, every time the action kicks in I just see him running around spaceship corridors. While he isn't bad as the main guy he isn't exactly thrilling to watch either, he does the desk jockey pen pushing angle well but in the thick of some realistic action he doesn't quite sell it for me. I think the problem being we've seen Jack Ryan as a young smart keen company boy already with Affleck and Baldwin, and this doesn't really feel any different, wash rinse and repeat. The less said about the awful Knightly the better frankly, she just doesn't look comfortable in this type of movie, stick to your rom-com's and silly fantasies dear.I think in general this is a standard run of the mill espionage action thriller that combines elements from 'The Bourne Identity' and 'Mission: Impossible'. I'm sure you can guess what I'm getting at...this film offers nice sequences of standard hi-tech computer hacking gadget filled tomfoolery with some nice chase sequences and a bit of fisticuffs to boot. None of it is anything remarkably special, we've seen it all before albeit this time its inevitably slicker and glossier. The whole roller coaster sequence where Ryan must infiltrate Branagh's posh offices, hack his computer and download/upload files for the CIA is the main set piece and admittedly its done well. Think of the Cruise sequence in the first 'M:I' flick where he's dangling from wires...well that doesn't happen here but there's the same kind of high tension as Ryan must hack n jack within a time limit before his actions become noticed and the bad guys come running. Its the best bit of the whole film and it did make me sweat I won't deny, of course you know he will make it but still. Other than that its pretty much the same kind of stuff you've come to expect...car chases, damage porn, a few punch ups and a big explosion at the very end which really should of caused a lot of damage despite the film making it out to be a happy ending.It all came across as a very tame safe sanitized action thriller with not much action or any solid brute violence. I'm not saying that violence makes a film but I think this needed some beefing up definitely. Branagh is a competent director but here he offers nothing new or anything to stretch the limits of our imaginations. There are many espionage franchises out there these days and at the end of the day this just doesn't cut the mustard if you ask me. Back in the day the older Jack Ryan movies fared better because there was less competition in this genre, these days forget it, this is going nowhere fast.5.5/10",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

80,khanbaliq2,Jack Ryan is reborn in this Bourne-like action thriller.,7,18 February 2014,"More than a decade after the disappointing The Sum Of All Fears (2002) we get yet another film about novelist Tom Clancy's character Jack Ryan. Clancy was certainly an establishment writer, so I wasn't looking forward to seeing Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Still, since I had some time, I went to the auditorium where the film was being screened and watched it for free. It turned out to be a fine action thriller. The story that was concocted by screenwriters David Koepp and Adam Cozad lacks originality but it provides the film with a number of thrilling scenes. The dialogue is also above average. Chris Pine, our new James T. Kirk, plays the clever all-American CIA tool Jack Ryan. Pine is a good leading man, and he manages to make Ryan into an assured hero. The rest of the cast, dominated by Brits, turn in fine performances as well. Kenneth Branagh, known for recently directing Thor (2011), plays the villain of the film, a wealthy Russian with a grudge against the US of A. Branagh's Viktor Cherevin has a number of memorable lines and icy glares but, best of all, he can kill a person with an energy-efficient light bulb. As a director Branagh makes almost every shot serve a purpose in the film. British establishment actress Keira Knightley plays Ryan's pretty fiancée Cathy Muller. After an excursion into less famous film fare Knightley decided to return to the mainstream it seems. I never considered her to be a good actress but she does have appeal. She even looks like my mother, but I still can't like her because she's a British actress. I hope she doesn't follow in the footsteps of that British witch Vanessa Redgrave. Anyway, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is definitely a competent spy movie. But one can raise questions about the story. The Russians are represented here as terrorists and haters of America and England. Perhaps I wouldn't take this so seriously were it not for all the other anti-Russian propaganda that's being released by the establishment nowadays. Back in the 1980s Tom Clancy's novels were published to glorify the American and NATO armed forces and to demonize the Soviet Union. It's no accident that the dumb market-fundamentalist president Ronald Reagan praised Clancy's book. In the 1990s, after a change of politics in Russia, Clancy had to write about other alleged threats. It's interesting that even back then he began to demonize South American drug dealers, Islamic terrorists, and a rising China. He also continued to mock the Russians. This reveals how good the intelligence picture that Clancy was getting from the establishment really was. And, of course, Clancy's books continued to be adapted to film, this time with Harrison Ford in the leading role. In the 2000s the establishment's promotion of Clancy continued. His work spread into video games, and his novels could be purchased just about anywhere where books were sold. But Clancy was getting less respect. With a new wave of Anglo-American imperialist aggression it was now obvious that the real threat to peace is in London and Washington. And the alleged blunders and crimes that Clancy blamed on the Russians and others were now openly being committed by the British and the Americans. Clancy died on October 1, 2013. His books, however, are still there, which means that new films will be released in the years to come to demonize America's alleged enemies.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
81,carbuff,How bad is this film? Let me count the ways.,4,3 May 2015,"I was originally going to rate this tepid production a 6 but unfortunately for it, I watched ""Cleanskin"" immediately afterward, another film that loosely fits in the same genre and totally schooled this one, much like college schools grade school. ""Jack Ryan"" features a bunch of big stars (Pine, Costner, Branagh, Knightley), but, unfortunately, all of them rate much higher on the ego and glamor scale than on the acting one. I don't think I felt a single believable emotion at any point in this film anywhere. (On the side, is Kevin Costner a narcoleptic or what, since regardless of the film he's in, he always seems to be talking in his sleep. Ben Affleck seems to suffer from the same affliction--long lost relatives perhaps?) For gifting us, the viewing public, with this mediocre time-waster, all of these actors should be knocked back to the dinner show theater circuit to hone their craft, not to mention as penance. Making matters worse, the plot was contrived and ridiculous. Any reasonably sophisticated investor knows that only in its dreams could Russia, and especially any single Russian corporation, collapse the entire United States economy, barring major military action, or course. My theory here is that since Tom Clancy bled money from every orifice, skilled money managers did everything for him and thus he himself knew nothing at all about global finance. Finally, another part of the plot hinges on a terrorist attack nearly identical to an actual one from quite a long time ago (pre-9/11) which failed badly, so why should the same basic thing be expected to be hugely more successful the second time around. Can't we reasonably expect terrorists to learn from their mistakes? In short, I know I've just ticked off a whole lot of Tom Clancy fanboys, but this film is shallow and stupid and obnoxiously attempts to hide its gross inadequacies under the skirts of simple-minded jingoistic patriotism. On the other hand, it is very well-filmed. Your call.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

83,bob-the-movie-man,Linear story but good popcorn film fun,7,28 January 2014,"Quick pop quiz: name the four actors who have played Tom Clancy's CIA character Jack Ryan on film .? OK – I'll give you a clue Chris Pine plays the latest incarnation in Kenneth Branagh's new film: ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"". This is not a film that is going to challenge for the Oscars methinks, and it doesn't have the angst or artistry of an art house movie. But – in the same vein as last year's 'Olympus Has Fallen' – it is a damn good popcorn movie.Following 9/11, we see Ryan persuaded into serving his country before, via a military adventure in Afghanistan, he is recruited into an elite team of – (erm) – accountants by shadowy CIA character Thomas Harper, played by Kevin Costner. Harper's team is tasked with stopping the financing of terrorists from attacking US targets (apparently the rest of the world is fair game). Suspicion falls on Russian oligarch Viktor Cherevin played with menacing glee by Branagh himself. Jack Ryan is sent to Moscow to audit him. I'd like to pretend that that's a euphemism for a 'hit', but no – he really is sent there to audit his company records. Not sounding promising is it? Ryan himself is also the subject of suspicion, but this time from his beautiful but rather clingy doctor girlfriend Cathy Muller (Kiera Knightley), who is completely unaware that he works for the CIA and thinks he's having an affair (probably with Alice Eve because she's seen Star Trek: Into Darkness). She is clearly cast as the damsel in distress, so you can bet your bottom ruble that she may end up in distress before the end of the film: the plot of this film is sufficiently linear enough to not disappoint.Chris Pine – about as omnipresent on screens at the moment as Cumberbatch – is a ruggedly macho boy scout, at his acting best when he is out of his depth: a scene where he is talked back into role via a mobile phone call with a monotone CIA call centre prole is particularly good. Keira Knightley, shapely as ever, plays her American accent really well. My wife commented that only her dental work the giveaway to her Great British origins (""saucer of milk, table 12″)! But it is the old boys of the film who have the most fun. I mentioned in my review of 'Man of Steel' last year how good it was to see Costner back on the screen again, and here is again – this time very much in 'Bodyguard' mode. Very good he is too: steely but with a twinkle. And Kenneth Branagh revels in his role as the evil Russian businessman, bent on the destruction of the US but with some of the most ineffectual security known to man. But he does find a use for those old energy saving lightbulbs the UK electricity companies insist on sending you: worth seeing the film just for that.Branagh directs with good pacing and some nice 'Bourne style' editing, especially during an exciting car chase through the streets of Moscow. This is how ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" should have been. Patrick Doyle supplies the thumping soundtrack which supports the action well.The story, that seemingly pits the Russians against the Americans is – from the timeline – clearly set in the present day, but seems out of its time: it might have worked better if the whole think had been set Argo-style in the 70′s (but then we wouldn't have had the internet!). Despite the rather random reference to 'the Chinese' at one point, this is a bit inexplicable. But then, this is not a film to think too hard about. The plot (if I can bend English to call it that) is enjoyably ludicrous, with so much depending on pure lack and the wild mental leaps of Ryan's analyst (which of course are always 100% right). Whilst the film could have been sub-titled ""Adventures in Accounting"" and it shouldn't work, it really does most of the time: perhaps the film is targeted at grey pen-pushers who really think they would drive cars like that if they didn't also want to keep a clean licence? (Oh! Perhaps I'm one of them!) It is a couple of hours of fairly mindless escapism and if you don't see it at the cinema you should watch out for it on your next Transatlantic flight.And by the way, the answers to the pop quiz are Chris Pine in ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit""; Harrison Ford in ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger""; Ben Affleck in ""The Sum of All Fears"" and Alec Baldwin in ""The Hunt For Red October"".(For an archive of my previous film reviews please check out http://bobmann447.wordpress.com.

84,bryank-04844,This is a great start to a reboot of the 'Jack Ryan' franchise .,7,22 August 2015,"It's been quite a number of years since we saw the character Jack Ryan save America from an impending doom. It's been twelve years in fact since 'The Sum of All Fears' where Ben Affleck played Jack Ryan. Before him was Harrison Ford in 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger', and Alec Baldwin played the hero character in 'Hunt for Red October'. This time around we receive a much needed reboot to the franchise, and let me be the first to say, this is a solid action spy thriller. I can't wait for the sequel.Shakespeare vet Kenneth Branagh plays double duty here as director and actor. This is actually the first time Branagh has directed himself since the 90s 'Hamlet'. Plus anytime Branagh plays a sadistic villain is gold. This 100 minute heart pounding action movie is quick, smart, and keeps the suspense high throughout the entire flick. With some solid performances by everyone involved and some of the best car chase sequences of recent memory, this should be the film you see this weekend, and I expect and hope for the box office returns be enough to warrant a good sequel.With 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit', we get an origin story of sorts with Chris Pine playing the titular Jack Ryan role. It's funny, because Pine is now Captain Kirk in the new 'Star Trek' films, which was also a reboot and origin story. We start out in the year 2001 where Ryan is over in London studying Economics and watches the Twin Towers fall in NYC on September 11th. Cut to a few years later high up in a helicopter where Ryan is now a Marine. The helicopter is struck by a missile and Ryan ends up in physical therapy for a while to learn to walk again.However, his determination by his doctor Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley), who he is in love with and the sudden appearance of CIA operative Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) fast track Ryan's recovery as he might just have a new job with the CIA as a financial analysis. Cut to present day where Ryan is an undercover CIA analysis on Wall Street where he Cathy live together and he leads a fairly normal existence. But just like in the 80s, the Russians are back to wreak havoc on the sweet freedom of America and destroy us all. This is where Branagh comes in and lights up the screen with his evil ways and Ryan is forced to switch from economist to ultimate spy as he dodges being killed by everyone around him, dives fast motorcycles and cars, and has to kill any Russian that steps in his way.Branagh did a great job with the fight scenes as nothing was too quickly edited and we got to see Pine and his foes battle it out nicely. The car chases scenes are the best here and proves that Branagh knows how to keep the suspense all the way through a chase. I swear I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. There is not much in the way of special effects here, as most of the stunts looked practical with no CG, with the exception of some of exteriors of Russia, which looked more like a Candyland board game than an actual city.Pine does a solid job with Jack Ryan. From his struggle in therapy to him realizing who he has to become to stay alive is done very well by Pine and I always believed he could take out anybody bigger than him in the film. Costner again turns in a solid performance and was cool to see him snipe enemies. Knightley does well, but turns on the cheese factor a bit in a few scenes, but as always she is beautiful and charming, even with an American accent. Then there is Branagh himself who gives a great villain performance as the big bad evil Russian guy who is not above torturing and killing women. Since his portrayal of Iago in 'Othello', this is his best villain performance.This is a great start to a reboot of the 'Jack Ryan' franchise and this should be the film you see this weekend.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
85,Hayden-86055,"Unexciting, muddled and with no interesting characters",2,29 December 2020,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit stars some big actors, (Chris Pine, Keira Knightley, Nonso Anozie, Kevin Costner and Kenneth Branagh) which makes it all the more worse when they have nothing good to do. The plot is very poor, a generic cold war action thriller, being an original story and not adapted from one of Tom Clancy's novels makes it difficult to fully get into, and it doesn't help that the story is extremely muddled and disjointed. The end fight makes no sense especially after the villain is taken supposedly beaten up in the underground and then apparently reapers inside the car with the bomb (?), the car that somehow managed to get out of the underground and onto the streets in seconds. Furthermore, the film is worse than James Bond and not a proper Jack Ryan adaption so that leaves it in a terrible grey area, it has no personality of its own and relies on other films to inspire it as a cheap knockoff.The fight scenes are one positive, they're fairly intense and moderately well done, none of them are great but they're passable.

I've never personally read any of the Jack Ryan books so I found it extremely hard to be invested in the character. He was just kind of dull and didn't give me as much action as I was expecting.

The actors are way too talented to be associated with something this low-calibre.The one positive note I can say is thank god it didn't go over 2 hours. I don't think I would have been able to cope.

87,timdalton007,Welcome Back Jack,8,18 January 2014,"More than a decade after The Sum Of All Fears marked the apparent stillbirth of a new film series based on the novels of Tom Clancy, another attempt has been made to breathe life into the series. The result is Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit which, in something of a departure from previous films, isn't based on any of the Clancy novels at all. So how does this latest film stand up and is it any more successful as a reboot than its predecessor a decade ago? Certainly this film has done a better job of casting its lead character. Chris Pine's Jack Ryan is everything that the Ben Affleck version tried to be but failed: the young analyst used to sitting behind a desk who finds himself caught up in extraordinary events. Pine does a fine job of portraying that, be it behind the desk as a Wall Street stockbroker or in some of the film's action sequences. Not only is he believable in those roles, he also makes the transition between the two believable as well during scenes in the middle of the film. As a result, not only is Pine fine in the role but also helps to sell the reality of the events in the film.There's also a good supporting cast as well. Kevin Costner (who incidentally was the original choice to play Jack Ryan more than twenty years ago) is well cast in the role of Ryan's CIA mentor Thomas Harper, bringing with him the presence of a man passing the torch to a new generation while not yet coming in from the cold. Keira Knightley gives a good performance as Cathy with a good American accent and while her and Pine have good chemistry, the character is undermined somewhat by some inconsistent characterization by the scriptwriters. The real star of the supporting cast though, and perhaps not surprisingly, is Kenneth Branagh as the Russian businessman Viktor Cherevin. Branagh takes a potentially clichéd role and brings not just a presence to it but a sense of intelligence and menace right from Cherevin's first appearance. The results, when combined with appearances in small roles by actors like David Paymer and Colm Feore, are strong all around.The film's production values are quite strong as well. Though better known for his Shakespeare adaptations such as Henry V and Hamlet, Branagh proves himself more than capable of directing a fast paced and stylish thriller with his handling not only of character moments and dialogue sequences but the film's varied action sequences (the latter seeing him back up by veteran second unit director Vic Armstrong). The film, largely shot in the UK, does a good job of capturing the feel of its Russian locations thanks to the talents of production designer, Andrew Laws, the cinematography of David Paymer and the costumes of Jill Taylor. Frequent Branagh collaborator Patrick Doyle once again provides the film's score and the result is one of the better action film scores of recent memory.So how much resemblance does the film bare to any of the Clancy novels? Perhaps more than one would expect. It does a fine job of taking Clancy's background for Jack Ryan and updating it for the present day (given that Clancy made Jack Ryan Jr the focus of the novels published during the last decade of his life, it's easy to imagine Pine playing Ryan Jr to Costner playing Jack Ryan Senior). The film's plot, while adapted from what was an original screenplay instead of a Clancy novel, brings to mind moments and element from more than a few of Clancy's novels. That said, how the film unfolds is far more in keeping with more straightforward thrillers than the way Clancy's novels tended to but given the difficulties in trying to do that on film (as seen with the attempt made to make the nearly thousand page Sum Of All Fears into a two hour film) that might not be a bad thing. Overall then, the film more than adequately makes use of at least part of its original source material while also forging ahead with something new.In the final analysis, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit does what it sets out to do. It presents an entertaining and stylish action/thriller that reboots a dead franchise while also not ignoring the basics of its original source material. What more can one really ask of it than that?",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

89,griffolyon12,A Fine Spy Thriller,9,21 January 2014,"Reboot is a word that I've grown to detest in Hollywood, primarily because reboots or remakes rarely live up to their original counterparts, but for once I think there is a reboot that actually works. I am speaking of the new film, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Based off of the Tom Clancy CIA analyst formerly played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck, Jack Ryan has always been the everyman secret agent. While yes, Jack Ryan was in the Marines and knows how to fight, he's kind of like the Jimmy Stewart James Bond. He's how you and I would be in these situations. In essence, he's a boy scout with a moral compass, and for me that's why I've always loved Jack Ryan. In this film, we see Star Trek's Captain Kirk, Chris Pine, as Jack Ryan, and he is probably the second best Jack Ryan ever, behind only Harrison Ford himself.In Shadow Recruit, we see the origins of Jack Ryan, how he came to be in the CIA, meet his future wife, and so forth. When Jack uncovers a plot orchestrated by Russian businessman, Viktor Cherevin (played with delight by director Kenneth Branagh), Jack must go to Russia to investigate. What ensues is a Hitchcockian game of cat-and-mouse that is as suspenseful as anything in the previous films involving Jack Ryan.While in my opinion nothing can really touch director Phillip Noyce's Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, Shadow Recruit manages to come close. With Shadow Recruit being the first Jack Ryan film not based entirely on a Tom Clancy novel, there was some trepidation on my behalf, but while the mission that Jack is going on in this film did not have its roots in Clancy, everything that the character goes through does. What the filmmakers did with this film was they took everything that was just backstory in the Tom Clancy novels, such as the helicopter crash that ended Jack's career with the Marines, and they actually show it and make these origin elements integral parts of the story. It's this attention to detail that makes this film worthwhile as a fan of the series. However, what really distinguishes this film from many other spy films, and it's what's always distinguished the Jack Ryan films in general, is that there is a heart to not only the character, but to the stories as well.In most Jack Ryan adventures, his family plays an important role in dictating his actions and painting him as a man we can relate to, Shadow Recruit is no different. The heart of this film is Jack's relationship with his future wife, Cathy, who has to deal with the ramifications when she learns that Jack is in the CIA. It's all really good stuff that plays to the heart of who the character is, and it affects your heart as well and makes you care for these characters.While Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit may not be as over-the-top or implausible as other spy films, it's probably the most realistic spy film made in a few years, and for that nice change of pace, I think anyone should check this film out and give it a chance.I give Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit a 9 out of 10!",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Older films have done by far a better job at it.

He seems a little out of place. In the ""Bourne..."" series, it seems the operatives were played by familiar faces, but all capable of darker places. To me, Costner is a star playing a sidekick part, which I think took away a little. Mostly as he was suppose to have a very father-son type relationship with Pine. Much like Affleck had with Morgan Freeman. There's just a gravity there that Costner doesn't have.Overall though, if you have a slow night, this is a good one to pop in.

94,Rickting,The personification of an OK action movie,5,19 November 2014,"The Jack Ryan franchise returns after being dormant for a while with Chris Pine as the title character and an against type Kenneth Branagh directing. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit is the very definition of an OK action movie. It's perfectly decent but feels incredibly forgettable and half hearted. The title character, working for the CIA, tries to stop Branagh's Russian villain from crashing the US economy. You already know the rest. A positive aspect is the way the movie emphasizes suspenseful surveillance action over mindless car chases, so it uses suspense more than some of its type. Kenneth Branagh directs the film well and is a good villain as well, even if his character is just a cliché on legs. There are some entertaining action sequences which are fairly claustrophobic, so you can actually tell this one apart slightly from all the other action films out there. As I love action movies this was watchable and adequately entertaining throughout.The problem is that although it's watchable it's kind of bland. Chris Pine is good but doesn't do anything hugely interesting with the main character. Keira Knightly is atrocious as the love interest. The film is as monotonic as she is, never really hitting its stride and going the motions throughout. The script is pretty lacklustre and has little to no energy. Although it does its best, I'd forgotten much of it only a fortnight after seeing it. it does have dips between the action where both the pace and script simultaneously slacken and it can't seem to cope unless there's something striking going on. It's an OK film, better than Need For Speed, The Legend Of Hercules, I, Frankenstein and Sabotage and won't end up on many worst of 2014 lists at the end. Although, that may be because no one really remembers it. A disappointment which could have been more, but at least it delivers on action and is perfectly inoffensive action fun.5/10",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
95,DareDevilKid,One of Ryan's Best Outings,8,23 June 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsThe first Jack Ryan adventure to hit theaters since 2002's lackluster, ""The Sum of All Fears""; ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" follows Tom Clancy's title figure as he arrives in Moscow to confront a nefarious villain, (Kenneth Branagh's, Viktor Cherevin) bent on crashing the United States' economy. Before it reaches that point, however, the film concerns itself primarily with Ryan's origin story, as the narrative zips from his college days to his stint as a Marine to his early endeavors as a CIA analyst. When we meet Jack Ryan (Pine), he's a college student in England. Then the events of September 11, 2001 take place and we meet him again on a military mission in Afghanistan as a member of the U.S. Marines. After his helicopter is attacked and crashes, his injured body is sent to Walter Reed Medical Center where he learns to walk again thanks to his beautiful doctor, Cathy (Knightley). Now working as a bank examiner, Jack hides from Cathy the fact that his job is a cover for his work as an analyst for the C.IA, where he was secretly recruited while in the hospital by Thomas Harper (Costner). Jack's latest assignment will take him to Moscow, where his dealings with crooked businessman Viktor Cherevin may make this mission his last.First things first, this film is not based on any of Tom Clancy's books. The filmmakers have basically taken his most popular character and given him a new back-story. And, whether or not you're a fan of Clancy's espionage novels, the film works purely as an edge-of-the-seat action- thriller. While Ryan is much more of an action hero here than previous outings, (""you're not just an analyst,"" Harper tells him) Pine still manages to keep the character grounded in reality. Knightley gets a little more to do here than in some of Ryan's love interests from erstwhile adventures, and she fits her role perfectly. Costner is an excellent choice to play Ryan's mentor, and adds resolve and depth to his character.There is little doubt that ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"", in its deliberately-paced first half, possesses the feel of a rather generic spy thriller. Pine's charismatic performance certainly goes a long way towards alleviating what could have been a fairly regular premise. He effectively convinces us of his display as a subdued protagonist, which requires more brain power for his character than muscle power. It's obvious, however, that Branagh's scenery-chewing work as the villain remains a clear highlight throughout.What is most exciting about the film are its spectacular action and chase sequences, particularly one in Russia, where Ryan breaks into Cherevin's office and later on has to rescue his fiancé in a high-octane chase segment. It's during these unexpected turn of events midway through the film, that ""Shadow Recruit"" really kicks off and elevates itself into intriguing and pulsating territory, from what could have been an otherwise routine thriller. From here onward, the movie actually begins living up to its potential. Adding gravitas to Branagh's succinct direction, is cinematographer, Haris Zambarloukos', mastery over capturing the hustle and bustle of the proceedings and convincingly portraying the skirmishes. Editor, Martin Walsh, also does a fine job of keeping the action scenes down to just the right length. Nevertheless, at the end of the day it is veteran filmmaker Branagh's astute handling of the subject and subtle revelations of the plot twists, which keep us glued to the edge of our seats.Even if ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" falls a few notches below ""The Hunt for Red October"" (undoubtedly Ryan's best cinematic outing), it's still in league with two other of Ryan's stupendous spy thrillers - ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"", and certainly miles ahead of its predecessor, ""The Sum of all Fears"". Fans of Tom Clancy's iconic literary hero or of the 90's films in general, can take heart in the knowledge that the franchise looks to be headed towards a smart, new horizon, and that Jack Ryan could end up facing many more exciting missions in the future.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
96,TheSquiss,"Brainless, fun rebirth of Tom Clancy's all-American CIA hero.",5,7 February 2014,"Jack Ryan: nine novels (15 if you include the Jack Ryan Jr series), five films, four lead actors (Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck & now Chris Pine) and two reboots. Tom Clancy's best-known character has endured and enjoyed a varied existence to say the least.Intended as the second reimagining, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, is more a rebirth of the Marine turned CIA agent turned world-saving, death-defying, awe-inspiring, all American hero. Forget the books, ignore the timeline, disengage the brain, abandon reason, slice the pizza, sip the beer and settle down for a mindless romp. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is predictable fun with barely a toe in the world of reality but it is fun just as long as you forget to think.Jack Ryan (Pine) is a student at the London School of Economics when terrorists fly two aeroplanes into the World Trade Centre towers. 9/11 prompts Ryan to make a career about-turn and join the Marines. Fast forward a few years and Ryan is undergoing intense rehab in a military hospital having barely survived after a chopper he was aboard was shot down in Afghanistan. Ryan is firstly observed and then recruited by the shadowy Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) as a desk-bound CIA analyst, but a trip to Russia to investigate the nefarious financial dealings of Viktor Cheverin (Kenneth Branagh) elevates Ryan very swiftly to role of field agent, and an action man is (re)born.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is neither as loud nor as brainless as last year's White-House-under-attack double act of White House Down and Olympus Has Fallen but it is about as much fun and has at least as many plot holes. The entire finale comes about as a result of a catalogue of unrealistically simple contrivances and there is no reason to have Ryan's girlfriend, Cathy Muller (Keira Knightly), anywhere near Moscow other than to sex up the film and redress the situation of the underused Anne Archer from the Harrison Ford years.There are no prizes for acting here. Pine may have found franchise work for the next few years but Costner, Knightly and Branagh are here for the light relief and the easy pay cheques. Let's just hope that for each of them this is merely a short break from the superior work of which they are all capable.Branagh, on double duties as actor/director, will have done himself a lot of favours here with the money men at the studios and it further cements his position as a gun for hire in Hollywood, but all these popcorn flicks he's turning out for the studios take him further away from shooting another series of Wallander for the BBC. And I for one am not happy about that.It must be possible to make a thriller that is exciting, suspenseful, vaguely realistic and intelligent, but Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit isn't it.

97,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Middle Ground,5,17 January 2014,"Chris Pine became famous playing a young Captain James T. Kirk in what seemed like standard STAR TREK prequels but turned out being something else entirely, having to do with an alternate universe or timeline, or something And now he's a revamped Jack Ryan, author Tom Clancy's resilient CIA operative played by Alec Baldwin in THE HUNT FOR RED October and taken over by Harrison Ford in PATRIOT GAMES and A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER (let's just forget the Ben Affleck attempt).Like Captain Kirk, this Jack Ryan exists on another plain altogether and, having become more of a timeless James Bond, he's now part of the 911 generation... And that's where things start, right on the fateful morning of September 11th, 2001 and Jack, attending college in England, winds up joining the Marines, becomes an injured war hero and is rehabilitated by his doctor, who just happens to be a single and gorgeous Keira Knightley as Cathy MullerAt this point the film skips past three years like nothing at all. What's important is Jack's first assignment takes place in Russia, a once Communist country now (supposedly) bathed in opulent capitalism. His mission is to thwart a plot to... well... let's be carefully cryptic because SHADOW RECRUIT attempts to engage like a page-turning novel wherein various clues and twists keep the story moving There is an intense set-up to how Ryan goes from desk jockey to intrepid agent, and yet the best parts don't deal with sporadic pulse-thumping action sequences.When the chief antagonist is introduced, played by the director himself, Kenneth Branagh, there's a potentially intriguing James Bond vs cerebral villain aspect Too bad the results are a predictable kidnapping and an 11th hour terror threat back in America.In the title role, Chris Pine does a decent enough job: sophisticated one minute and getting his hands dirty the next Meanwhile the cliché romance between Jack and Cathy pales to the slowburn interaction with Kevin Costner's CIA mentor Thomas Harper. Both make a pretty good team. The main problem are the computers, so quick to find imperative clues there's little purpose left for Ryan.While not a perfect espionage thriller, SHADOW is entertaining but ultimately feels like the first half of an introduction stretched into a feature length film Let's hope the next venture (if there is one) goes beneath the modern advancement to see what this new recruit is really made of: Like the Bond franchise shed most of the signature gadgets, Jack needs far less technology to really shine.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

99,MovieHoliks,Not Too Bad...,6,22 May 2015,"I've never been a big fan of any of the Tom Clancy-based film series about CIA analyst, Jack Ryan, so was not all that terribly excited to see this new reboot of the series- which is not based on any of Clancy's books, but instead, an original story. I thought the best in the series was 1990's ""Hunt for Red October"", with Alec Baldwin in the role. Then Harrison Ford (who originally turned down the role in HFRO) took over in two successful installments- ""Patriot Games"" & ""Clear & Present Danger""- both decent thrillers, especially CAPD. However, the 2002 film ""Sum of All Fears"" (with Ben Affleck taking over the character)- absolute schnooze-fest.This new reboot, which was only minimally successful at the box office, certainly less so than it's predecessors, now has Capt. Kirk himself, Chris Pine, playing the character. And I was surprised to see once Shakespearean filmmaker, Kenneth Branagh (who also has a supporting role), directing- who seems to be moving into the more mainstream movie- making territory with this movie, ""Thor"", and the new ""Cinderella"" movie. Kevin Costner also seems to be making a nice comeback in the past couple years, especially in supporting roles, playing a key character in the Tom Clancy/Jack Ryan universe, who will also be used I've heard in an upcoming film version of Clancy's ""Without Remorse""- should be interesting.Okay, my take on this film, like I said- not all that too excited to see this, however, actually found it to be a decent thriller. This film takes Jack Ryan to the beginnings of his CIA training, which he was inspired to get involved with after the 9-11 attacks. This new reboot seems to be putting Jack Ryan into more of the straight-up action hero role. In fact, I've read some user comments talking about how some things didn't make sense- that this guy was able to do physically. Keira Knightly plays his girlfriend/fiancé', who is in medical school (I think Anne Archer, who played the character in the two Ford films, was a doctor-??). All-in-all, I enjoyed it enough to give it a marginal thumbs up.

101,Al_The_Strange,Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit review,6,28 January 2014,"Throughout the Cold War era and the aftermath, Jack Ryan has been the heart of Tom Clancy's spy thrillers. On film, Jack's adventures were at their most thrilling in The Hunt For Red October; they reached some decent emotional heft in Patriot Games; it ultimately ended with a lackluster note in The Sum of All Fears. After all these years, a reboot with Ryan in the modern age (an age of terrorism, globalization, and increasingly-advanced information technology) was inevitable. With a stronger focus on the character's origins, this film looked to be a promising new start on a stagnant (and perhaps outdated) saga.The film has its share of thrills and action. It moves at a fairly even pace, with a few major chases and shoot-outs. Ultimately, the action never really stood out; it actually became rather muddled and gaudy, thanks to some ugly camera-work and editing. I found the infiltration scenes to be the most suspenseful and thrilling, but they never really offered anything new to the table. That just leaves the characters and their dynamics as the big standouts in this film.Jack Ryan's character is at his strongest in this film, largely because he was given little depth in the original four films to begin with. The first half of Shadow Recruit covers his origins pretty decently, and it follows Tom Clancy's original tales to a point. It is pretty noteworthy to watch the guy overcome physical therapy and rise to the challenge of becoming a CIA analyst, and eventually a spy. When the film's second half hits, however, everything slumps back into standard spy-movie territory, complete with a clichéd, megalomaniac villain orchestrating a clichéd, megalomaniac plot. The idea of economic disaster is interesting and perhaps relevant, but its execution is very much more of the same. The film ultimately strains believability by its end, as a number of contrivances emerge at the plot's convenience to speed things up to the climax (including the convenient appearance of other spies to help Jack along, and the convenient last-minute analysis of everything to figure out the endgame). In the end, the story became more of the same; the best that can be said is that the characters are somewhat endearing, and the relationship between Jack and Cathy drives a good part of the story's dynamic.This film has pretty good photography in some areas, but it becomes very hideous in the action scenes, due to some extreme camera shaking. Editing is okay most of the time, but was rather poor in the action scenes, as they strung together a lot of the images in a haphazard way (and in some cases, cut up some shots erratically for style points). In some scenes, it was obvious that the dialogue was over-dubbed, and I found it distracting. Acting is okay; Chris Pine does his best to be earnest and heartfelt, and I think he's a decent match for Jack's character (miles better than Ben Affleck, maybe arguable when compared with Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford). I enjoyed Kiera Knightley's performance, Kevin Costner is pretty much himself, and Kenneth Branagh plays a pretty standard bad guy. Writing is okay, but it does spell things out pretty blatantly in certain scenes. This production uses sets, props, and costumes that appear slick, but are simultaneously dark and drab. Patrick Doyle's music score is pretty cool.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is nowhere near as much of a game-changer as Casino Royale was to James Bond; if anything, this film proved to be, simply, more of the same. Fans of the character and fans of spy fiction might get a kick out of this, but otherwise, it doesn't really offer anything really profound or groundbreaking.3/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

106,ericrnolan,"A review of ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" (2014)",6,18 June 2019,"""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" (2014) is easily the least of the Tom Clancy adaptations. But that shouldn't be enough to indict the film; the other film treatments of the author's books have all been roundly excellent. (Okay, 2002's often-reviled ""The Sum of All Fears"" might be an exception, but I still like that flick even if I'm in the minority.) I'd rate this outing a 6 out of 10.It isn't a bad movie ... it's just an average, generally undistinguished boilerplate spy thriller that seems half-heartedly rewritten as a reboot of the Clancy films. Screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp pay cursory attention to the title character's background, and a key plot development from the books that I will not spoil here. But the film utterly lacks the mood, detail or methodical plotting of anything Clancy created.It's all very generic stuff. We've got a generic, telegenic, twenty-something action hero (Chris Pine), his generic hot girlfriend (Keira Knightley), the expected Russian bad guy (Kenneth Branagh) and a by-the-numbers climax - including the last-second requirement to divert a bomb from its target. Rounding it all out is Kevin Costner, the most generic good guy ever to behave predictably on screen - he characteristically projects the expected, wholesome gravitas. Even this film's title is generic - it sounds like the name a marketing department would come up with for an entry in a video-game series.There are plot elements that are painfully implausible, even by spy-movie standards. Jack Ryan's new girlfriend, for example, surprises him by arriving in Russia in a flourish of quirky-girlfriend spontaneity, only to discover his secret career and then be fully enlisted in a spy operation. Branagh doubles as the movie's director; his work here is surprisingly problematic. This is yet another movie in which important action sequences are barely comprehensible because of frequent, rapid cuts.Oh, well. It certainly isn't all bad. There isn't a single bad actor in the film, for example. If I don't like Branagh's directing, I love his acting. The guy is magnetic - he alternately and convincingly projects menace and charisma to perfection. Alec Utgoff shines too, in a small role as a soft-spoken, ironically disarming Russian assassin.People tend to either love or hate Costner. I like him quite a bit. No, he doesn't always demonstrate an incredible range. But his acting is competent and he's likable and consistently convincing.

107,kgprophet,Lack of Depth Doesn't Feel Like Jack Ryan,4,17 January 2014,"This reboot feels like a knockoff similar to A Good Day To Die Hard. Both have chase scenes in Moscow and both were made relatively cheaply, well this one even more so. What disappointed me most was the attention to detail that Clancy was always famous for. A great deal is smoothed over to forward the plot in it's brisk pace. Previous Ryan films were capable of bringing depth to the peril and stakes as the players made their moves. Where previous Ryan films had large political stakes that brought real tension, the stakes here seem to be more economic than fear for great loss and limb, although the third act implies some mayhem. In general you can't really compare this cheap knockoff to a minor tent pole film that has a big enough budget to have a larger scope and sexier action scenes. The car chase is too generic in jump camera shots, etc. to feel much tension. But other spy thriller moments do thrill, so I will give this film enough credit to deliver on some of the goods. Another unflattering comparison is the Bourne Legacy reboot. It also suffered from lack of budget for a decent action punch.Pine as Ryan is less inspired for me. Perhaps because his face has been seen quite a bit lately, or his characterisation has less depth. Same goes for the mentor character played by Kevin Costner. There is too little meat to chew on. A better move would have added a few more wrinkles (not necessarily plot twists), such as more than just a few shots of the terrorism plot brewing in the United States. I would support a sequel to this reboot if a better budget with some more meat pieces, and a story that is fleshed out better. I believe director Branagh is a capable but not exceptional director, and some scenes slightly miss the mark. The overall slick look that is also a trademark to Ryan films is missing here, although the production design is not lacking. My final analysis is that this is a film not based on a Tom Clancy novel that is an average of 900 pages of background, substance, and real drama. That lack of depth makes this thriller too transparent.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
108,shawneofthedead,"It's all done well enough, but there's nothing new here.",5,15 January 2014,"Prior to 2011, nobody would have pegged Kenneth Branagh as the director who would bring Jack Ryan back to life. Sure, Tom Clancy's secret-agent protagonist is smarter than most, which might be a good fit for Branagh's more Shakespearean proclivities. But how would a director better known for filming scenes in iambic pentameter fare with a huge budget and chase sequences? Then, Thor happened - Branagh's entry in Marvel's superhero canon turned out to be an oddly effective blend of brains and brawn, and earned him his stripes as a blockbuster director. It's no doubt the reason why another major Hollywood studio was willing to take a chance on him helming a potentially enormously lucrative franchise reboot.As it turns out, Branagh really is quite good at balancing thrilling action beats against solid character development - Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a bit smarter than the average, by-the-numbers thriller. It's just a shame that this new incarnation of Jack Ryan, for all its valiant attempts to drag itself out of the '80s, still feels curiously old-fashioned.Jack Ryan (Chris Pine), as the film quickly establishes, is a hero in every sense of the word. A decorated war veteran with impeccable academic credentials, he's bodily dragging himself through a harrowing physical rehabilitation regime when he's recruited to go undercover as a financial analyst by CIA agent William Harper (Kevin Costner). For years, Jack does his day job and slips his handler important nuggets of financial data. Just as his fiancée Cathy (Keira Knightley) starts to fret about the fraying state of their relationship, Jack uncovers a massive financial conspiracy engineered by Viktor Cherevin (Branagh), a shady, off-the-books Russian operative who intends to kick off a double-barrelled terrorism attack on America.So far, so Cold War. In a cinematic world uprooted by the gritty cynicism of The Bourne Identity, that's probably Shadow Recruit's biggest flaw. Steven Zaillian's deadly earnest script pointedly kicks off with 9/11 and the impact this world-shaking event had on a young Jack Ryan. It's packed with dense detail and references to current geopolitics and financial mucking-about.But it's all just so much window dressing. Scrape away the fancy smartphones, cutting-edge technology and fancy security systems (which still aren't enough to stop a barely-trained agent when he's tossed unexpectedly into the field), and what you're left with is a film with a solidly old-fashioned heart, its core narrative plucked out of the icy tension of the Cold War and forged with the same easy mistrust of the Soviet Union that informed many a thriller of decades past. Shadow Recruit feels like a throwback to a more unreservedly glorious time, none more so in its wholly cynicism-free final scene - a moment so purely patriotic that it feels distressingly outdated.Get over that hump in its narrative, and Shadow Recruit works well enough. The action scenes, which kick into high gear once Jack turns up in Moscow, are brutally woven together - a highlight being a bruising fight in a shimmeringly modern hotel toilet. The intelligence heist at the heart of the film is maddeningly impossible to pull off in real life, but is shot through with an electric charge, as all the puzzle pieces come together and Cathy dances a desperate metaphorical dance with Cherevin.Pine - filling shoes that have been worn by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck - struggles at times without a quip or the ability to flash his dazzling smile to get out of a sticky situation. He's a better Captain Kirk than he is Lieutenant Ryan, but he's serviceable in the part. He has good enough chemistry with Knightley, who runs around looking beautiful and affecting a fairly effective American accent, and even comes close to (but not quite) breaking free of the 'damsel in distress' stereotype once she gets in swept up in the casual mêlée of lies and violence swirling around her fiancé.As Cherevin, Branagh is a powerful presence. He's loaded down with clichés by the truckload - at one point, an underling even chastises him for succumbing to the traditional weaknesses of the typical Russian male - and there are moments when he's so ripely evil that he's just a notch below an over-the-top Bond villain. But Branagh just about makes it work, selling the motives and personal heartbreak behind Cherevin's nefarious plans.At a moderate running time of 105 minutes, Shadow Recruit still feels too long - perhaps because it's hard to shake the feeling that you've seen it all before. The twists have played out in many a spy thriller, the characters are mostly the stock ones dragged out for such occasions, the plot could have been ripped straight out of a film made thirty years ago. That Branagh makes it all hang together is perhaps the most impressive thing about this well-intentioned but not particularly successful reboot.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
109,bobbobwhite,Total suspension of disbelief,5,23 September 2015,"If the gov't and its ""employees"" ever acted with such intelligence, efficiency and speed as it did throughout this film, in the entire existence of our gov't, it would still be a gross fabrication never to be believed for a second. Facts, maps, details, vehicles, people, passwords, accounts, bad guys, good guys, etc., etc...all were easily found in a tech instant in this fairy tale story. If the gov't was even 1% that good, it would be god and we would worship it. But, of course, it is incompetent, stupid and slow, as we all know, and we all hate it. Did I say it was also corrupt? Fast action is this movie's god, not any level of sense or reality, as it has little else but tech mumbo jumbo and totally impossible action scenes impersonating spy world reality.

110,TheMarwood,Low wattage thriller,5,10 January 2015,"Kenneth Branagh takes up double duty here, as the villain and as director for hire and pulls neither off. Shadow Recruit is a low wattage thriller and it very rarely has any life in it and just plods along until it ends with a whimper. The screenplay feels like a rough outline of a film, with characters and the entire premise not fleshed out. There's nothing complex happening or anything that might tax your attention if you zone out or leave for minutes on end and this is so straightforward - they couldn't even bother with a double cross or any character complexities beyond someone being one of the good guys or one of the bad guys. With an economic threat and a terrorist threat aimed at the US financial sector, nothing really feels at stake and everything unfolds in predictable fashion. Besides an easy payday, it's hard to see what attracted Branagh to such a vanilla and generic film. Chris Pine is serviceable as Jack Ryan, but he doesn't have much to do here and considering how bland and dull the chain of events are, the film doesn't have the spark that should reignite the franchise. There's no chemistry between Pine and Knightley and a pivotal scene where he confesses his secret job is so flat and poorly handled - that a smile and an '""ok""' is all the material Knightley is given -- lazy writing that sidesteps anything remotely challenging. The action is edited in typical seizure inducing quick cuts, that feels totally half assed by Branagh since the man is capable of so much more and this comes across like he can't mount an action scene if his life depended on it. Shadow Recruit is your run of the mill time waster that feels like a feature length TV pilot.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

You think Russians are evil. And we, the Americans are the best people on Earth. Instead of something original, we get a blatant plagiarism of James Bond movies. Tom Clancy would not be proud of what you've done. Shame on you, Hollywood. Shame. On. You. Please stay true to the source material and hire actors who sound like they're not bored next time.

112,rollernerd,Bourne or Ryan??,6,1 May 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is another reboot of Tom Clancy's main fictional hero,
Jack Ryan and this time he is incarnated by Star Trek alum Chris Pine. The title of the movie is...Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014)...which makes you question whether this flick will be more a super spy or political thriller flick. It is obviously more of a super spy mixed with elements from Bourne and Bond. In this reboot we do we see why Ryan enlists in the Navy and how he recovers from the back injury which was only mentioned in Red October out of all the flicks. We go through the same elements of how an office desk analyst who may seem to be frustrated by lack of action, places himself by chance into difficult close combat situations. In comparison with the other flicks this movie is deep into the character's belief in defending his country, which is briefly demonstrated by the September 11 attacks. The baddies in this flick is once again the favourite arch enemy, the Russians. This time, the attack on American soil is more embedded with Wall Street, so pretty much the Russians plot to buy up U. S. Treasury bonds and sell them off while simultaneously bombing a section of Wall Street which will lead to the fall of the USA. Interesting story, which has tight and intriguing elements but still manages to recycle the same formula of an implausible heist and a time-bomb finale.Other than Pine, we have Kevin Costner who plays Harper, a mentor type figure to Ryan, similar to the Batman Begins formula ala Liam Neeson playing Ras Al Ghul. In this flick though I feel Costner is more of a babysitter and is underused. Plus we have Keira Knightley as Cathy Muller who has more hands on screen time with both Ryan and the bad guys in this flick however unfortunately she is played as the typical female character who is kidnapped and must be saved. And then we have the director Kenneth Branagh who also plays the Russian villain and does well by playing a slimy baddie and his Russian accent is quite good but just like with the other characters in this flick - its all recycled and nothing new is given to the table. This flick fails to create its own identity and in spite of trying to use the Bourne style fast-paced sequences, it looks like a generic action thriller.The scene where Ryan is forced to defend his life in a hotel room battle and his conversation post this encounter is great to see the different layers of the character along with his phone conversations with Cathy however this film diverges from this and instead we get an uninspiring, one-dimensional film instead. Costner does well to as a character to show Ryan the ropes and Knightley does well at the start as this anchor for Ryan, a reminder that he is a man with a life not just a mission, but as mentioned she's mostly out of the action and has to be rescued - stereotypical. The filmmakers along with Pine, fails to make this new Jack Ryan incarnation more appealing, like with Baldwin we had the know-it-all Ryan and with Ford we got the reluctant hero boy scout. Having said that the flick is wayyyy better than The Sum of All Fears, even if this flick is a mediocre flick with familiar elements seen in the Bond flicks, the Bourne series or Mission Impossible series. Overall 6/10.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
113,Brooklynsmagicmike,"While it can be cheesy at times, overall it was still an enjoyable movie.",7,29 May 2021,"I'm big fan of just about anything Tom Clancy. Whether its books,movies, games, etc. However over the more recent years I noticed the standards have gone down greatly. Therefore I avoided this movie for years. I decided to give a try today though as rainy day watch.My verdict is that it has its share of flaws but overall its definitely decent watch. First I thought Chris Pine did excellent job as Jack Ryan. Hes a really good actor and this role just fit him very well. However the rest can not be said about the other actors. Keira Knightly while she might be eye candy was brutal to watch in this. From the odd facial gestures to awkward chemistry at times. Kevin Costner was no better if I had here him yell Jack one more time I might lost it. The dialogue at times in this movie was just bad.Other positives were definitely the visuals that I felt were good, and pacing for 2 hour movie was great never did it feel draggy or slow at all. However in my opinion the film could of used more action. There was about maybe 3 actual action scenes and they were short.Give it a watch if you're looking to kill time just don't expect to much out of it and you'll have a decent time here.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
114,jb_campo,depth lacking.,6,12 October 2014,"This movie tells the origin story of Jack Ryan, a star in the Tom Clancy books previously made into movies like Hunt for Red October or other movies with Harrison Ford as Ryan.So this Ryan is younger, with Chris Pine as the star. He's OK, pretty athletic, smart, good sense of humor. Kevin Costner kind of seemed a bit miscast as the guy who brings Ryan into this world. Keira Knightly is the Ryan love interest. She ends up pretty involved by the second half of the film. By far the best action is from Kenneth Branaugh as this Russian corporate leader/bad guy. He nails the accent and ruthlessness you expect, while exhibiting a soft side connection that he struggles against.Ryan becomes a financial analyst and discovers there's something going on with a lot of money at stake. He ends up in Russia fighting for his life and trying to save the world. Then he ends up elsewhere again trying to save the world. You get the point.the story though lacks depth. there is not really much left for you to figure out, so you just wonder when the movie will end. there have been better Ryan films, so maybe next one will be better.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
115,nicolechan916,"Not such a unique story, but was still engaging.",7,15 June 2014,"I've heard that people who read the books by Tom Clancy are dissatisfied by the way this film turned out. Apparently, the Jack Ryan character in the books has a more unique stance than the one shown in this film. That would have actually been better I guess, as Jack is supposed to be an analyst and the film just turns him into another Hollywood spy.Even though it seems like any other spy movie, it wasn't that much of a cliché. There were suspenseful scenes which made it thrilling and the action scenes did not go overboard (as many spy films tend to be).The acting was pretty good as well. Chris Pine made it believable that he was inexperienced in the field, but I have doubts that he could have been able to run fully after his accident even after 10 years. The chemistry between Pine and Knightley was pretty believable as well. The other actors and actresses did a good job, enough to fit in to the shoes of their characters but not enough to stand out. Or maybe that means there should have been more character development.Read more of my reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
116,trublu215,Great action sequences can't seem to elevate it,6,19 January 2014,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is an espionage thriller with hard edged violence, a very intricate plot, and two great performances from Pine and Costner. However, the film can't bolster past the shadow of other better films such as Skyfall and The Bourne Identity. Jack Ryan sits as a film happy with it's mediocrity, which isn't a bad thing at all. It does have some really great moments in it, one of which is the ending. This is yet another film that has three really awesome scenes amidst really bad ones. Some of which come from Kenneth Branaugh himself, portraying a cyber terrorist with an annoyingly tacky Russian accent. However, where Branaugh falls as an actor, he makes up for as a director. The action sequences and fight scenes are very well done and are something to marvel at, even if the plot isn't. Chris Pine gives the best Jack Ryan performance next to Harrison Ford. Kevin Costner does very well as Will Harper, Ryan's boss. However, despite enormous chemistry between Pine and Costner, the film never levitates to the likes of Skyfall or any of the Daniel Craig Bond films, for that matter. And the biggest disappointment of the entire film, for me, would have to be Kiera Knightley. Knightley is a very talented actress that really flexes her capability in period pieces. Knightly does NOT belong in this film. She is a weak link, a very weary performance and meek delivery makes it not only embarrassing to watch, but also very painful. But, she doesn't quite ruin the film, but she most certainly takes you out of it.Overall, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is an above average January release that is worth the ticket price if you are tired of all the seriousness of the Oscar contenders. If not, and you want to catch up on some Oscar nominees, then wait for DVD. Either way, the film is worth watching.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

118,FallenEye,Jack Ryan: A Shadow,5,18 July 2016,"What Jack Ryan suffered most from, was a script that wasn't smart enough, to out-smart the the villains, pretty well thought out plan. The villain's plan is an ""8"" so to speak, but the hero's counter attack, is a 5... That compromises the films' integrity, logic and enjoyment.Jack Ryan couldn't live up to what I imagine was a plan roughly a decade in the making by Viktor Cherevin, but that probability wasn't portrayed too well either.All Kenneth Branagh did, to make Jack appear to be the smarter adversary, was him constantly making Jack inexplicably figure out Viktor's moves. Truth be told, given this particular story, Viktor had to win, but of course, he had to lose because of, because.Then there are all those badly edited scenes, so much so that, you can feel that, there is probably a good extra hour of footage that we'll never see, because it perhaps, was decidedly badly handled or it was directed into the ground and even more unimaginative. The final scene being the worst. The action is lack luster, the suspense is thrown to the wayside and it's end... Huh. Honestly,this is a movie, where if the villain won, it would've been so much more interesting, than Jack jumping out of a van, and then... Nothing exciting.Clearly it was meant to be a series... Sadly, it was seriesly (seriously), ""non compliant, officer"".When it started, it was lingering on 6. Then Mr Branagh engaged, enough to bring it to a 7...

There have been so many ""government agent"" movies since the last few stabs at Jack Ryan, you'd be hard pushed to find anyone interested in him making yet another come back.The Kids of today (Who this flick is clearly aimed at) have most likely never heard of Jack Ryan, and are hardly likely to get invested in him after this movie. Its not that its actually that bad of a film. It was better than I thought it would be, and was actually fairly decent, with some great action sequences. But its not a film is it? its a franchise. One that will hide in the shadows of all the other ones that are out there. Maybe that's what's actually meant by ""Shadow recruit.""

Some reasons for this are the amazing cast, led by Chris Pine, who should really get more credit for his talent. The plot was well developed and interested and the dialogue had a great combination of realism mixed with some thrown in humor that lightened an otherwise very dark and intense movie. Intense would be the word of choice, too, because this is definitely an edge-of-your-seat thriller from fairly early on. I couldn't give it top marks mainly because of the way the earlier part of the film is structured. It feels a bit cut-and-paste and doesn't develop the characters as well as it could've.

Each and every time they were sharing the screen with her, I swear I could see them steal a glance here and there looking at those chompers! Word of advice, fix'em Keira, you have the dough! Nevermind the disturbing visage she made trying to mumble an American accent. Usually it is the other way around and I'm always amused at how clumsy American actors are at faking an English, Scotish, Welsh or Irish accent...except Peter Dinklage on ""Game Of Thrones"" and Merryl Streep in anything! Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" started out promisingly enough. This was supposed to be a franchise re-boot, one that would signal a kind of passing of the baton from Alec Baldwin who played Dr. Ryan, Tom Clancy's prodigal CIA son and all-around American optimist, in ""The Hunt For Red October"" (1989) and Harrison Ford who also took a stab at being Jack Ryan in two outings, ""Patriot Games"" (1992) and ""Clear And Present Danger"" (1994). Then, as neither actor chose to return inhabiting Jack Ryan's meat-suit...the franchise was literally murdered by Ben Affleck and whatever genius or geniuses who decided to green-light ""The Sum Of All Fears"" (2002) an overwrought, melodramatic, way too messy and outhere thriller, that failed on many, many levels.But ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit""'s promising beginning did not pan out...as the movie went from decent, to ""Why are they doing that?"" to ""I don't get it?"" to ""What the hell was that?"" to ""Oh for f **k's sake!"" The movie turns into a mumbled, awkward mess, Chris Pine is alright, but the rest of the cast isn't, while the plot and the storyline start out well intentioned, but deteriorate alongside the crummy script and mediocre direction. Kenneth Branagh needs to set the breaks on his directorial career before he becomes a joke. Compared to this turkey, ""Thor"" is light years ahead! Jack Ryan, much like Jack Reacher, inhabits the no-man's- land between James Bond and Jason Bourne, and like last year's aborted franchise ""Jack Reacher"", ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" fails to capture it. Very much like Jack Reacher, this new Jack Ryan is less of an analyst and more an exaggerated and puffed-up idea of the everyman hero...My favourite of all the Jack Ryan movies remains ""Clear And Present Danger"", where Harrison Ford really captured what Ryan was meant to be all along, an ordinary man out of his element, but a determined individual who does what he must, because to his own very uncomfortable realization, there is no one else to do it...The new Jack Ryan tries to incorporate some Bond and Bourne elements, and fails at that miserably!

In 1990 viewers discovered Alec Baldwin in ""The Hunt for Red October"" as Jack Ryan, first adaptation of the 1984s novel. In this new film Jack Ryan, as a young covert CIA analyst, discovered a Russian plot to crash the US economy with a terrorist attack. The Cold War may be over but they're America so they keep the fear alive. The pivotal events happened at the beginning of the film as the young student in economy watch the September 11th terrorist attack, first attack on the US floor since Pearl Harbor in 194. Wounded as enrolled in the Marines, a CIA field agent offers Ryan a job as analyst in a Wall Street company. Quickly Jack Ryan's character appeared to fit super well to the previous Captain Kirk, Chris Pine, who leads action scenes efficiently. His apparent physical fragility hide a genuine rational and motivated personality, which is very interesting in such ways that we clearly want to know more about what he's capable to do and who he is. Plus, a Trust pattern is present along the film. Beginning with Keira Knightley girlfriend character, who plays a part which at first seems not plainly defined. Bounds of her involvement in his life are blurred. Then, Kevin Costner must be secretly a bad guy, leading a team where Jack Ryan is supposed to be a simple financial analyst and at least happened to be thrown in the field, risking his life as well as his fiancée's. His characters intentions are not known. Indeed, we don't know why he's here, why he choose him particularly, and how he heard about Ryan's works on top-secret-various subjects. I know what you're thinking: that's a proper characteristic of CIA Agent. But his mysterious and foggy personality works quite well in this Spy-Thriller directed by the actor-director Kennegh Branagh, not surprisingly playing the villain. The Russian basic villain. Personally, my favourite scene is Ryan ""First Time"" killing someone. This film is playing it safe, we all seen that kind of spy things before. Last scene close the loop with Ryan introduced to the President, typically American. But generally speaking, we saw spies killing people and then going on with their life normally. Ryan is obviously not used to it. We actually saw him dealing with it, he's shacking, and I assume that it's how it should be. Good job bringing it to life! This film is a paradox as its a bit disappointing but quite efficient as well.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
129,WubsTheFadger,Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,5,10 March 2018,"Tom Clancy re-heats the Cold War from the grave in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, a streamlined reboot of a 1990s-rooted Paramount franchise in which the United States is saved from another 9/11-sized catastrophe altogether too easily. As the fourth actor to portray the title character in a five-film series thus far, Chris Pine adequately follows in the footsteps of Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck in what also amounts to an origins story about the character's trial by fire in the CIA. Commercial prospects look solid, if not spectacular, for this efficient, if ultimately rote, political thriller. While it benefits from an attractive cast, the perennial allure of the spy game and the exoticism of the contemporary Moscow setting, the biggest problem afflicting this modest diversion is that it's the sort of film in which computers get to the bottom of every problem that comes up in about five seconds. It seems like half the running time consists of characters in cars, vans or planes, in their offices or hotels or just on their cell phones managing to download or send whatever secret information is in play with a click or two, and nevermind such cumbersome annoyances as passwords or user IDs. And no one ever needs to call a tech supervisor.What actually is in play here is the value of the American dollar, which is what Russian oligarch Viktor Cheverin (Kenneth Branagh, directing himself onscreen for the first time since Hamlet) aims to collapse along with Lower Manhattan in a coordinated terrorist attack. With the Kremlin in cahoots with him as a silent partner, the plan is to bring the Yankees to their knees in a way the communists were never able to do.Equally nationalistic is Jack Ryan, first seen here watching the attack on the Twin Towers while a student at the London School of Economics. Inspired to help his country, he's soon in uniform serving in Afghanistan, where he has the misfortune of being shot out of the sky in his chopper, but the good fortune to be nursed back to health by a beguiling doctor, Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley, complete with an American accent), with whom he takes up as soon as his treatment is finished.There is a certain generation-spanning pleasure in watching veteran CIA handler William Harper (Kevin Costner, in low-key authoritative form) set Jack up as a financial intelligence analyst within a big Wall Street firm, where he spends a decade before being given five seconds to pack for his mission to Moscow. Despite living together, Jack can't tell Cathy whom he works for, and when she discovers a ticket stub for an afternoon showing at the Film Forum of the old thriller Sorry, Wrong Number in his pants pocket, she's convinced he's having an affair. Who knew that downtown venue for revivals and arty fare was a popular spy information exchange spot?Once Cheverin is identified as the key to the gross international monetary manipulations, Jack is charged with accessing the key files the Russian has hidden from view. In a scene that doesn't make much sense, Jack is put to an immediate physical test by his Moscow airport greeter, a mountainous Ugandan bodyguard who tries to take him out as soon as they reach the hotel. Unexpectedly, Cathy then turns up in Moscow and finally must be told what her husband does for a living, leading to the film's high point, a dinner scene at a fancy Moscow boite during which the couple enacts an elaborate charade that allows Jack the chance to steal secret info from Cheverin, whose vices -- vodka, vanity, women -- are neatly exploited.Such key plot elements as financial-based terrorism, lingering Russian animosity towards the U.S., sleeper agents and the electronic world providing the main battleground are aptly handled and the action is plentiful, if not terribly unusual. The relationship between Jack and the woman he dearly wants to be his wife is appealing, and Branagh's villain is shot through with deep historic bloodlines (his office is dominated by a huge painting of Napoleon being turned away by Russians).But there's at least one car chase too many and the climactic one, in New York as the seconds tick toward another downtown disaster, feels jerry-rigged specifically to include every cliché in the generic urban suspense playbook. Instead of embracing dramatic complexities and setbacks, all the better to make the most of them creatively, screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp are intent upon steamrolling right over them, to uninvolving effect.
Pine is fine as the uniformed-turned-covert patriot; he lacks the physical stature of his predecessors and it's not entirely believable that he could prevail over the African bodyguard who turns on him. Beyond Costner, Branagh and Knightley, all good to have around, the cast doesn't possess the sort of depth or number of prominent players that the earlier Jack Ryan features did. Technically, the film is sharp, with Moscow panoramas supplemented by scenes of Liverpool doubling as the Russian capital.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
130,lucasnochez,Review--Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit/ Night Film Reviews,2,20 January 2014,"January is my least favourite month for new movies. By this time of  year, Hollywood studios are focusing much of their attention on the  Sundance Film Festival, looking to acquire hidden gems, potential  blockbusters and, and marvelous new indies. These films are generally  purchased for next to nothing, and then marketed and released  throughout the summer and fall months with the hope that they might  land a huge profit. With that being said, while Hollywood runs around  securing their paychecks for the upcoming year, the rest of their  unwanted, formulaic, and clichéd roster is leftover for audiences in  January. Now let me be the first to tell you, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit  is no exception to this formula. Using the star-power of Chris Pine's  Stark Trek franchise charm, to faded out female leads like Kiera  Knightley, and ex-Marvel super director Kenneth Branagh (Thor), Ryan  becomes a shady, old, and tiresome relic of the glorified days of the  once cool Tom Clancy character. This was one film project we wish  stayed in the deep dark corners of Hollywood's unproduced films, but  like much of the industry's obsession with rehashing established  characters and modernizing them for current audiences, the film is a  complete decomposed mush of ideas. Shadow Recruit is an overly-flashy,  glossed over disaster. Failing to recruit any kind of originality in  it's storytelling and script, it becomes a non-operational feature with  actors who are clearly cashing in to a well established iconic  Hollywood character.  The Jack Ryan character, made famous previously by Alec Baldwin in The  Hunt for Red October, Harrison Ford in Patriot Games and Clear and  Present Danger and Ben Affleck in The Sum of All Fears came out well  before all the Ethan Hunt's and Jason Bourne's of its time. What  differentiated Ryan from all the super-human covert agents, was his  ability to be the closest thing to an average, everyday superhero. Mind  you, in his newest entry in the film world, Ryan seems to have his fare  share of dumb luck a lot of the timeall the time actually.  The film was supposed to be released on Christmas Day 2013, instead,  due to an overcrowded array of blockbusters and late-entry Oscar  caliber films, Shadow Recruit opted for an early 2014 slot where it  seems to fit in much better.  Pine plays Jack Ryan, who we first see attending the London School of  Economics in England. After a fateful September day in New York City  (I'm sure you can guess which day I'm referring to, especially since  all terrorist inspired spy-plots these days revolve around, if not hint  at this historic day), Ryan pursues a career as a United States Marine.  Wounded in action, Ryan oddly gains the attention of CIA agent Thomas  Harper (Kevin Costner). Ryan's intellectual expertise and Marine  instincts, along with Harper's experience in the agency, the two team  up to bring down an elaborate economic scheme that will leave the  United States in a Second Great Depression. Plunged into the world of  Wall Street as an analyst, Ryan unnoticeably navigates the corrupt  underworld of financial markets, which inevitably leads him on a place  to Russia and face-to- face with Victor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh).  Between navigating the Russian crime world, a life of espionage and the  annoying and overbearing requests of his girlfriend Kathy Muller  (Knightley), Jack is tested physically and mentally as he is left with  the fate of the US economy resting on his shoulders.  Throughout the course of his mission, time and again Ryan begin to lose  faith in his ability to come through a hero, and frankly so do we. The  blame can't all be put on Pine, who really does his best with material  that seems D.O.A once it hits the screen. Unfortunately, Ryan doesn't  actually accept his mission and take on the bad guys until his female  love interest is put in the mix and inevitably endangered, which let's  be honest, makes for a cowardly and unmotivated super-spy.  The film tries its best to round out a cast that is engaging,  meticulous and somewhat ironic to the overall Jack Ryan canon. Costner,  who mentors Pine as the current Ryan, was first offered the role of  Ryan back the late 80′s, but declined to star in Dances With Wolves,  which earned him two Oscars. Knightley, who seems to be floating under  the radar rather than on the it these days, clearly took the role to  get her face back in the mainstream spotlight, especially since her  descent into independent feature film fame has not planned out as well  as she would have liked since her blockbuster days in the Pirates of  the Caribbean franchise. Branagh, who couldn't resist adding another  cultural character reference to his filmography, offers a typical  Russian villain with a laughable accent and unintentionally uproarious  one-liners. Either way you look at it, from the lazy one-sheet with the  exhausted catch-phrase ""Trust No One"", to the overused black/orange  colour scheme on the theatrical poster, Shadow Recruit doesn't seem to  have much faith in itself, much like the character Pine plays.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
131,priyantha-bandara,Thought it's going to be 'cheap' but I'm impressed.,8,28 May 2014,"What does Jack Ryan and Jack Baur has in common? Both of them are Americans and got injured in the line of duty, both of them single handedly saved the country from a devastating terrorist threat. Simply put this movie is all about being a hero and risking your life to save millions of others when everyone else is having a normal work day. How familiar the plot may sound and tested for many generations Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit does is so well and far better than many recent action flicks of the same nature. And I have thoroughly enjoyed it.Jack Ryan used to be a bright young PHD student at the time when the 9/11 attack took place. But soon he finds himself getting shot down on a helicopter in Afghanistan. And yes now he is a Marine in the US ARMY. But after sometime he goes back to university finishes his PHD and joins a company on Wall Street living the corporate dream. But not quite 100% as he has to work for CIA part time. Yes Jack's life is complicated. But it's about to get even worse when Jack finds out that Russians are planning to launch a massive economical terrorist attack and he is the only person qualified to stop it from happening. And now there are many guns aiming at Jack and he should choose which one to dodge first.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a straight out action movie. Though it has a slow beginning and not so much action in the first half it still successfully manages to keep the viewer gazing at it. Main reason is the gradual but steady development of the plot which on the background hinting that bigger things are to come. And the wait is all worth. You get this all gooey kind of suspense music played for a long while and then it hits the sixth gear. Thought the plot is kind of predictable there is nothing boring about it so the excitement doesn't fade.Just like all action movies Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit has its common flaws. Far-fetched moments, insanely fast (and not yet developed) tracking technology, hard to kill lead character are few of them. But then what action movie will be successful without them. We all know it's bogus though we stair at it mouth half open. But genuinely Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit was much more than I expected. I thought it's going to be 'cheap' but I'm impressed.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

133,CMTiago,Generic movie with a thrilling last half hour,7,30 May 2014,"The latest entry in the Jack Ryan franchise is your typical action movie with nearly every cliché in the book. It is not a bad movie in itself, but it lacks a fresh feel to it that hurt the chances of this movie breaking out. Starring Chris Pine as the titular character we are pulled into a plot that revolves around a Russian business man of sorts trying to bring down the US economy ,and with that, cause The Second Great Depression. Sound familiar? Yes, we have had pretty much our fair share of movies with the US-Russia conflict in the mix. Usually one tends to ignore this if the movie brings something new to the table. Unfortunately, it's more of the same with this film, as the ultimate American hero takes down the accent heavy Russian bad guy. The performances, of course, were the best that could be squeezed out of a laughable script such as this. Luckily I was thrilled enough by the last 30 minutes of the movie, as it was a non stop ride, after a dragged opening. Jack Ryan isn't the best movie to come out in ages. In fact it might fall into obscurity, and in the end if your taste is a high stakes action movie then this is the picture for you, otherwise this movie doesn't offer much else.Rating 7/10",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
134,Bravesfan17,A Nice New Take on a Popular Character,8,17 January 2014,"The late Tom Clancy had a successful career thanks to his novels revolving around Jack Ryan, a character primarily known for his work with the CIA. The latest adaptation of Clancy's work and characters was brought to the big screen by Thor director Kenneth Branagh and actor Chris Pine.The films begins with the title character Ryan (Pine) attending college in London when he witnesses the September 11 attacks on TV. Shortly after, we see Ryan in military action when he is involved in a helicopter crash. Subsequently, Ryan is finishing his rehab with Dr. Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley) when he is seen by CIA Agent Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner). Harper brings on Ryan to work in the CIA in the business side of things. However, Ryan comes across many private Russian accounts led by businessman Viktor Cherevin (Branagh). While finding this out, he uncovers a plot by Cherevin to have a terrorist attack by crashing the U.S. economy.From seeing the work Kenneth Branagh did as the director of Thor, it's easy to see why Paramount wanted to have him direct the new Jack Ryan film. Here, Branagh does a nice job of telling the story, making the film fly by, making the payoffs work, and great choices of where to point the camera. The only complaint I have is I felt that there were too many close up shots of the actors' faces. I did enjoy that Branagh's version was its own stand alone story.Chris Pine is now the fourth actor to portray Jack Ryan on the big screen. What I liked best of Pine's version of the character is how he shows us a new Jack Ryan who is in way over his head but is able to solve his problems quickly. Pine does great at making Ryan keep his cool and using his brains when fighting. Costner is great here as the mentor Harper. He is just right for the part in being the guy guiding Ryan. Knightley is a joy to watch here as Ryan's fiancé Dr. Muller. Cathy is no damsel in distress and Knightley plays her as a smart woman who can call out Jack's lies. Branagh is the supporting standout as the villain Viktor Cherevin. With this , Branagh brings a menace to the big screen, who is very reckless, yet he also has superiors to answer to. I also enjoyed how Branagh made Viktor a sophisticated character too in showing that this man is very smart.I also quite enjoyed the technical work put in here. There is excellent cinematography and editing. I was also amazed at the work done in the sound department that makes the film work well. I even quite enjoyed the visual effects in the film, which were realistic.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
135,nebk,Jack's A-Trying Unremarkably,6,13 May 2014,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a by the numbers action thriller starring Chris Pine in the Title Role. It is supposed to be a reboot of the franchise started by the Hunt For The Red October based on Tom Clancy's novel.As a movie there is not that much wrong with it, but at the same time there is no greatness to it either. It concerns Jack Ryan trying to stop a terrorist attack and a financial meltdown attempted by a Russian villain. We are also give an introduction of how he got into the covert world of Espionage. Ryan who is a financial analyst and a CIA Operative is tasked with going to Russia and analyzing the various covert accounts of the villain played by Kenneth Branagh who also directed the movie. Needles to say someone tries to kill Ryan upon his arrival to Moscow. Being the analyst that he is and also an ex-marine he manages to defend himself. His mistrustful girlfriend played by Keira Knightley then arrives to Moscow further complicating things or so it appears. In fact she becomes crucial in the attempt to stop the attack. From there on the movie is a game of Ryan and his mentor played by Kevin Costner trying to outwit the villain and foil his evil plot. The fact that they do it with relative ease in an almost effortless way within 24 hours or so, is where the problem lies. There is hardly any suspense in the movie and the tag line Trust No One is a blatant lie as there is no double cross of any sort. Everyone is exactly who they appear to be. So this is one of the movies major flaws. This and the fact that the movie seems like it was toned down in violence and content in order to make the movie a PG-13 release. The fact that Ryan was the one who discovered and foiled the attempt are implausible given that this plan has been in the works for years. The good points are that it's a movie you can watch with ease and without any need to engage your brain. Kenneth Branagh as the bad guy is very good, but he wasn't too tasked with the story or script in this one. Costner, Pine & Knightley are all decent actors in their roles but there is not much they can do with a simple story and script like this one. Overall I would rate it a weak 6-watchable and unremarkable.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
136,nickboldrini,Fairly generic spy thriller,6,27 October 2018,"This isn't bad. The first half seems to take quite a while in setting up the character before the big bad is unveiled, though. Not having read the books, I don't know how well this compares to the character. But it compares unfavourably to the mini series recently released (this is 2018) which gets more of the character across. To be fair, they had more time, but this seems to take too long getting to the point. And the point is a Bond type villian who isn't actually good (why wasn't Ryan followed on his walk, why did the bomb maker not shot him after the bike crash).

It just isn't her. Pine lacks intelligence and his fight scene with the big black guy, in the middle of the Moscow hotel (one more fact that doesn't really fit any common logic), is nothing short of hilarious. The worst part was the main villain - Kenneth Branagh. Probably after Hamlet and other historical movies, the ""artistic"" stardom went to his head, and he decided to act as the ""Typical"" Russian Villain he imagine inside his head.

The acting is fine, minus the fake American accent by Keira Knightley, the action is decent as well as the overall story.I like Chris Pine in the Star Trek films but his portrayal as Jack Ryan seems a bit one dimensional. There are parts that try to be clever and while some of them succeed, most of them do not. I know it's not always necessary but when a film tries to have funny one liners throughout a serious plot, they need to make sure the actors delivering these lines are successful.Plain and simple, this is just an OK movie that if you're bored and like the actors then go for it. Otherwise you're not missing anything special.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
143,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,4,18 January 2014,"Jack Ryan is the most famous character created by the American author Tom Clancy – he appeared in many of his novels and, prior to Shadow Recruit, was portrayed in four film adaptations: he was portrayed by Alec Baldwin in The Hunt for Red October (1990), by Harrison Ford in both Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994), and by Ben Affleck in The Sum of All Fears (2002). Shadow Recruit is the reboot of the Jack Ryan franchise (and the only Jack Ryan movie not based on a previously published novel) and in the movie he's portrayed by Chris Pine. Shadow Recruit is the first 2014 release I've seen this year, and I must say – we're not off to a good start.Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) is a student in London who, after witnessing the news of 9/11, enlists in the U.S. army. During one mission, his helicopter gets shot down and he gets badly injured. While he's in rehabilitation, he meets the movie's generic love interest, in the form of Doctor Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley), and CIA agent Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner). Harper is amazed by Ryan and enlists him in the CIA. Ryan starts working undercover on Wall Street looking for signs of terrorism, or something. He soon finds out about a shady Russian company, led by Viktor Chereving (Kenneth Branagh), which plans to destroy the U.S. economy, or something.Let me start off by saying Shadow Recruit is apparently dedicated to the late Tom Clancy. I fear he's turning in his grave right now because this movie is horrendous. Shadow Recruit's biggest problem would be the script, which makes this spy action/thriller lack decent espionage scenes, interesting action scenes or noteworthy thrills. On top of all that, the dialogue is atrocious: it tends to go from being unbelievably cheesy to laughably bad. And speaking of laughably bad – Kevin Costner is absolutely horrible, his performance is an unlimited source of unintentional laughs. The only one who could challenge Kevin Costner for his 'worst performance in the movie' award is Keira Knightley; her character and performance were extremely annoying and boring. Chris Pine is unexpectedly OK as Jack Ryan – however, script-wise, he didn't have much to work with.The movie's best aspect is definitely Kenneth Branagh, but not as a director, mind you (the directing in the movie is dull and bland)! He is great as the charismatic Victor Chereving and he managed to overshadow everyone else in the movie with ease. Despite his greatness, he plays no role in the movie's finale, which turned it in a boring, campy, underwhelming, badly written snooze fest – just like the rest of the movie. The last thing I want to comment is the movie's tagline, which is 'Trust No One': I don't see how that connects to the actual movie whatsoever, and I would like to make a slight change to the tagline to make it more appropriate for the actual movie. It should be 'Trust No One Who Says This Movie Is Good'.Rating: 4/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

145,CowherPowerForever,The Russians are coming!,8,15 January 2014,"The Russians are back at it again trying to topple America. Even though this story has been beaten to death, this story actually fits and works very well in the year 2014.First I just want to say I'm in no way a hardcore reader of the books written by the late great Tom Clancy. I have seen all prior films based on the character, but again not a hardcore fan like some.The story as I mentioned above is basically Russians bad, and trying to take down America. Yes this element in film is nothing new, however I actually think it was well written into the script written by Adam Cozad and David Koepp. With a weakening U.S. economy something like this that occurs could possibly happen inside the U.S.The acting is fantastic. Headlined by Chris Pine who has more than proved himself over the years with other acting films like Star Trek he at least in my mind fits the role nicely. The surrounding cast including Kevin Costner and Keira Knightley all work well together in the film. Kenneth Branagh who plays the Russian bad guy is fabulous in this film. One of the better bad guys I've seen in a action film recently.However I would say the film suffers from its shorter runtime. Each previous Jack Ryan film has been just about two hours or even longer. The plot and the development of the characters seems rushed with this shortened runtime. It brings the film down a few notches, but doesn't ruin the film at all.Since I seen the film in IMAX I will review that here quickly as well. The IMAX experience for this film is basically just a cash grab, and nothing more. None of the film was actually shot using IMAX cameras, thus there is no reason to spend extra money to see the film in IMAX. Converted IMAX really only brings in better sound in my opinion. The quality of the audio was thunderous and amazing. Nothing to warrant an extra five dollars or so for a ticket.Overall this film is good. The acting tied in with a good story leaves us with a film that can be enjoyed by the whole family.7.5 out of 10",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
146,TheSeaLion,Decent but forgettable,6,17 January 2014,"Chris Pine first starred as a new reincarnation of James T. Kirk from ""Star Trek"" fame. Now, he stars as a new reincarnation of the late Tom Clancy character, Jack Ryan. ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is a spy thriller with a solid plot and an action movie that is not smart action movie like ""Die Hard"", but not dumb like ""White House Down"". It rests safely somewhere in between the two at about average.After suffering an injury that results in him having to regain the use of his legs, Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) meets two people who will become large parts of his life, his nurse and later fiancé Cathy (Keira Knightley) and CIA agent Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) who offers Jack a job undercover in Wall Street. Jump ten years later to when Jack discovers a plan that will bankrupt the planet and send it into a second Great Depression. Jack is sent to prevent this from happening. While working the case, he is faced with several problems, some of which go nowhere.From an action movie standpoint it is solid and grounded in reality. Jack Ryan is not an invincible man and he can get hurt and he needs help from time to time. The only time that the film felt like it left the bounds of the reality that the film set up was at the end when Jack drove a truck into the water to stop a bomb. As an origin story for Jack Ryan, the origin part only takes about twenty minutes and then jumps ten years into the future without the audience seeing what happened, but just being left to figure out that something happened. For that reason, I did not think the romance between Jack and Cathy was very believable.The movie itself is not smart, but its plot is. Not because it is so well put together, but because the villain's entire plan revolves around economical jargon that is sometimes hard to follow and understand. The actors rush through dialogue at points and you can easily miss information. As a whole, ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is not a loud, dumb mess. It is decent, but it is also forgettable. There is nothing in it that will set it apart from other action movies and you aren't missing out on much by not watching it. However, it is still entertaining and gives what is promises.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
147,The_moan_of_all_moans,RIP Jack Ryan.,1,28 January 2014,"6.6 average? Is this some sort of joke? I genuinely had to look away and look back make sure my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Who in God's name would rate this film any higher than a 3? Where they on drugs when they watched it? Where they watching something else and got confused and rated/reviewed the wrong film? I am stumped, absolutely baffled.I (ignorantly) don't care for opinion on this one; normally you can say ""well that's your opinion"", but i have no option but to instead say ""your opinion is invalid"". This film is complete garbage. Not one shred of originality in the plot. It's more rehashed bile that ""Hollywood"" continues to spew out to the forgiving public. How could you possibly enjoy this film. It was almost like a spoof at points; scenes where so ridiculous that i had no choice but to laugh; Dialogue so dense and without any depth that i felt my blood boil. Chris Pine is unquestionably great in ""Star Trek"", but that's it and i'm sure there are the terror team of ""Trekkies"" who probably despise him, but as someone who is not compelled to dress up and do the little hand gesture he is good in it. But everything else; EVERYTHING ELSE, he is terrible. At the start of the film there is a helicopter crash (not a spoiler) but when he's being wheeled to the medics looking like a train wreck. The Doctor nonchalantly says he pulled the other guys out the helicopter....with a broken back!!!!! Since when was this a superhero film? There is one line which is in the trailer where the cheeseball Mr Ryan says something along the lines of ""i was under the impression this was an office job"" and then the kronic Kevin Costner replies along the lines of ""well you're in the field now"" and then this completely unnecessary score blasts out in the background. Entirely unwelcome in any way. And this happens throughout. Stupid comments followed by a burst of over the top background music. ""We'll split the bill""....then the roar of the orchestra. Unbelievable. And the same old stereotyping. Anyone who is not American is a terrorist and Americans are all heroes. Nothing new there. Keira Knightley is seemingly on some sort of happy pills; mushrooms or something. Like she's about to hit the giggles at any moment. Maybe it was because how atrocious Chris Pine is, i don't know.With this being the 5th Jack Ryan ""Epic"" hahahaha.....i am quietly confident that it may well be the last due to the horrific nature of this one. Well done Pine, you've just destroyed a legendary character. No-one will ever take the Jack Ryan character seriously ever again. Of course apart from the loonballs who decided to rate it higher than a 3.I have no faith in anyone who rates this any higher than a 3, i really don't; i couldn't possibly. Go watch Bourne and then come back and give it that rating it deserves. Be sensible; this film is balls.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
148,akshay-ak-kumar,A big let down,5,28 June 2015,"I'm a fan of the character called Jack Ryan. Though I've not read any of Tom Clancy's books about the Jack Ryan, I've enjoyed the character on screen. Even though the 'Sum of All Fears' was a disappointment, Affleck did a decent job to the keep the character in tact.However, this film is a big let down especially when I see that there are some intelligent people behind this film. Kenneth Branagh is disappointing both as the director and the main villain of the film. As the director, he makes a film which is mediocre and lacks the tension of a Jack Ryan film which we all have been associated with. There is not a single moment where there is a sense of tension which we audience can see and feel. Worse, he is a complete failure as a villain. He puts on a bad Russian accent and is not intimidating enough.The rest are terribly wasted. Pine plays the young Ryan with some earnest but his character his badly written. Costner and Knightley are wasted. Plus Pine and Knightley have zero chemistry between them.Overall, a big disappointment !!",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

150,s_campanale,The names Ryan...Jack Ryan! - Brannagh boots Clancy's series in the ass with ass-kicking reboot.,7,24 January 2014,"Jack Ryan is the analyst hero of the late Tom Clancy's best novels, a happily married middle aged nerd who somehow always finds himself in harm's way as he uncovers plots by the Soviets, the Bogota cartels, the Libyans, the IRA,etc. He had a cinematic career in the 90s, filling in for the 007 franchise that seemed to have finally run its course during its notable absence from our screens. Those films put clear blue water between themselves and Bond, being more serious, intellectual and less glamorous, not to mention more 'studied' and 'paced' (or 'dull' and 'boring' as some would put it) However, with the new generation of Bond movies being more like the old Jack Ryan movies, the clever makers of the new Jack Ryan movies have made them more like the old 007 films! Hence we now have a sexy young Jack Ryan (Chris Pine, whose wooden surname is a perfect description of his talents, but as a hetero guy I suppose I don't 'get' his appeal) with a sexy young wife (Keira Knightly, who fits perfectly beside Pine in the acting forest, and who as a hetero guy I still don't get the appeal of, but there you go?) and a gruff mentor in the form of gruff mentorly Kevin Costner. His character used to be black, so at least it shows that pointless racial changing can work both ways in franchises.We also get plenty of action, with two tyre squealing car chases (2 more than the entire rest of the franchise), another brutal bathroom fight to the death, lots of running around, night time sniper shooting, and of course defusing the ticking time bomb with only seconds on the clock! Plus we also get 'Thin man' style hero and wife in action comedy moments (Mr and Mrs Ryan?) and even a 'meet the villain while pretending to be doing business under an alias while both really know who the other is and exchanging clever pithy knowing remarks"" scene so beloved of old Bond. The look and pace of the film owes more to the modern techno thrillers which that other spy of yore, Jason Bourne. helped introduce such as shaky cam, frantic TV news reports, fast intercutting between busy techs in offices and centres etc.Like the 007 movies, the producers have ditched the original novel stories (which no longer worked in the modern world) and just taken the basic characters and scenario to use in their own 'ripped from the headlines' stories. The story they present is hardly going to stun anybody with its originality, and it is no lie to say that you've seen all of this before. The plot, once we get Ryan's 'origins' as patriotic economy student who served in Afghanistan before miraculously recovering and being recruited by Costner into the CIA as an infiltrator in financial institutions out of the way, is set in our old friend 'Hollywood Russia'. However this version of 'Hollywood Russia' is not as bad nor as rotten as the usual sort (""Salt"" ""Chernobyl Diaries"" ""A Good Day to Die Hard"") even though it's still basically corrupt and dangerous.Seems the Kremlin (yep, still the Kremlin) is unhappy at the USA's backing for rival oil pipelines which challenge its monopoly on Baltic crude, a heavy blow for the Soviet (sorry, Russian) economy. So Mikhael Barishnikov, who is now a senior Kremlin minister, hires oligarch and KGB (sorry, FSB) bagman Viktor Cherevin to put into action their dreaded ""Lamentation"" plan. (As in Lamentation-s of Clancy fans and Russian audiences) This will involve faking a major terrorist attack in New York carried out by a sleeper cell which will cover Cherevin's mass selling of the US Dollar, hence bankrupting not only the USA but also China and the EU as well, leaving Russia as the world's only economic superpower (Boo! Hiss!) Fortunately Ryan, monitoring dodgy activity from his Wall Street firm, smells a rat and goes to Moscow to meet with Cherevin. Like 007 he fools no one as a spy and is soon fighting for his life, engaging in sinister encounters with Cherevin, dodging his unimpressive henchmen and constantly rescuing his fiancée Cathy, who has turned up unexpected and is oddly pleased with her future husband being both a liar and a CIA covert agent, something that any girl would naturally be thrilled about. Then it's 'stop the plot before it can happen' as in ""Octopussy"" or ""Casino Royale"", and involves a literally ticking bomb (Cherevin is obviously not smart enough to use cell phone triggers like 99.9% of the world's terrorists) to save the world's economy and stop the Soviets (sorry, Russians) taking over the world (Boo! Hiss!)Brannagh does well on both counts, both as the evil but charismatic and also troubled and tragic in his own way Cherevin, and as director. After his Marvel labour of love ""Thor"", Brannagh seems to be branching out as a high end commercial director, which he is showing great skill in, and which is not demeaning to his other career as noted Shakespearian, for what would Shakespeare be making today if not films like this and 'Thor'?.Not the world's best thriller, but enjoyable enough in its own silly way, rather like the old 007s, or the Mission Impossible series (with which it shares a writer un-coincidentally) and will make for a fine undemanding evening at the cinema, presuming you are not (A) A Tom Clancy fan (B) Russian (C) Adverse to very ugly violence being in a 12a film.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
151,StonedMagician,Good: 7.5,7,28 July 2019,"I really can't remember the last time I went to see an action film in the theater. It's a genre that has just fallen out of my interest, as they all seem to be the same combination of bland writing and been-there-done-that violence. Based on what I knew of the plot and the names behind it, I expected Shadow Recruit to be a smarter-than-average, but still by-the-numbers take on the famed Tom Clancy character. I got what I expected, and not much else, really. To its credit, Jack Ryan makes a pretty good first impression. Chris Pine (Kirk from 2009's Star Trek), Kevin Costner, Keira Knightley, Kenneth Branagh directing, and the writer of Schindler's List. What emerges from this pool of venerable talent is, at heart, just another action-thriller, with the requisite fistfights, car chases, and race against the clock. It's all very well-done, to be sure, with fine performances and some snappy dialogue punctuating the occasional monotony. Fans of the genre or source material, or just the casual filmgoer, will have a good time. But it doesn't come without a cost.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
152,borismk-38942,Kenneth Branagh shines alone,6,6 November 2018,"I gave this movie 6 stars mostly for the performance of Kenneth Branagh. He takes a rather stereotyped role and breathes life into it. It's not that the remaining cast are bad, it's just that they're not that good either. Most of the roles aren't really complex or original, it tries to be an intense spy thriller that falls flat",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
153,JamesIan2021,Decent Spy Thriller,5,15 May 2015,"If it weren't for Kevin Costner or Keira Knightley this action thriller would've been a real forgettable affair, that's not to say that Chris Pine is bad, he's actually great but he's let down by a bland story, dull direction and a lack of thrills. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is the origin story to Tom Clancy's character, who is now operational on a mission to stop a wipeout that could destroy America. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is one of those films that has a lot in the trailer, but once you get to the film the majority of footage is shown doesn't happen, and that really really pisses me off. There were enormous explosions and some killer action shots but they are absent in the full feature. Directed by Kenneth Brannagh, his direction is fairly unimaginative, it feels half baked and then at times overdone like during the helicopter opening, the messy editing and overkill in chaos is headache inducing. Brannagh also stars as main antagonist Viktor Cherevin, his performance is average, I have nothing against Brannagh, he was great in Harry Potter and My Week With Marilyn but in this he comes across dull, his direction combined with his performance feels self indulgent, as if to say ""I'm in charge, I'll do it however I want and sacrifice consistency"". Aside from pedestrian storytelling and other major niggles, Jack Ryan offers some intrigue and intermittent thrills. The hotel shootout, the data hijack in Cherevin's HQ, the car chase and Wall Street chase propel the movie forward making it watchable, Keira Knightley is brilliant as Jack Ryan's girlfriend who eventually finds out he is a recruit, and decides to help which is a refreshing twist. Chris Pine is good but Kevin Costner outshines him with his cool performance as a shady and mysterious operative Thomas Harper, there's just some bad-ass about Kevin Costner, and I'm dying to see his latest actioner 3 Days To Kill. This is the definition of simple viewing, your brain doesn't need heavy engagement but there's something about that keeping you focused, and for me that's Keira Knightley, Kevin Costner and some of the action sequences, but this could've been so much more.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

The story lines are just...off somehow; not believable. And way too much with the subtitles; I don't want to have to read when I watch TV.

It is basically and action thriller but all the thrill elements were missing.I didn't get thrilled even for a minute.The clumsy handling of the story was the main reason for this failure.The story is handled awkwardly.I was unable to connect with the story.Nearly 3/4th of the movie was wasted in buildup which was too repulsive to bear.The heist scene was laughable.The patriotic theme of the movie was also too subtle. Performance wise everyone is OK.Direction is the most infirm thing of the movie.I expected it to be a decent entertainer but it was completely bland. 3.1 out of 10 would be enough.,Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
157,jackbanister16,Not impressed.,3,30 June 2014,"Being a big fan of Tom Clancy novels and Chris Pine, I figured that I'd watch this movie and enjoy it on a Friday night. I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular, but I didn't think it would turn out to be the lazy effort of film making that it was. This movie is a snooze fest. Seriously, just re-watch the Bourne Identity a couple times or the old Tom Clancy movies with Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford. WAY BETTER and still far more exciting. Chris Pine brings some much needed comic relief to the film and really does the best with what he is given, but truth is, there's not much to do here. Plot is very light; lighter than a watered down diet coke. PLOT: Jack Ryan goes from battered marine to financial analyst with the CIA. Then he goes from financial analyst to field agent in Russia. Then he uncovers a massive terror plot perpetrated by a guy with a computer. LOL. Yeah, it's pretty lame. The villain's Russian accent is laughably bad although he does bring a creepy element to his villain. This plot could have been interesting if they actually focused on one element for more than 5 minutes. Jack Ryan is said to be brilliant, but his intelligence and savvy is hardly ever shown except for a few brief moments. Basically, the pacing is too frenetic. There's never time to assess what just happened in the movie. One second, you're in Russia, then the next you're in New York with minimal explanation as to why. Kevin Costner is downright horrid in this movie. It's crazy to see someone who has fallen that far from grace. He goes from award winning director and actor to this all in a decade or so...crazy. Maybe he just knows this movie is awful so he doesn't put in effort, but it reflects poorly nonetheless. Long story short...This movie lacks focus, interesting characters, and even an interesting plot really. It's just a weak and lazy effort and if they're smart, they'll nip any sequels in the bud. I hate to leave things on a negative note, so I will say that some of the set pieces, locations, and cinematography were pretty awesome!",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
158,hthbrr2,Time for a Star Trek TV show!,1,24 May 2014,"OK I just saw this movie to make sure that all the rebooted Star Trek actors' career's are total failures. Now since Chris Pine was arguably the biggest star of them all in this ST reboot it would stand to reason that he had the BEST chance to make it big. Well he did not, so it's time for a Star Trek TV show. Please give the people what they want, instead of (rap they DON'T.I understand that most actors want to be MOVIE STARS. The honor! To play a different character each time! I mean TV shows, normally are for actors that are 1 note. Can't play a wide range, so they are perfect for TV.... To be on a TV show is somehow seen as an insult. BUT with TV show quality going up in recent years this is no longer true really. Many movie actors are now in TV shows. It's time the rebooted cast of ST STOP trying to have movie careers. Not to be mean they have the talent, BUT they just can't carry a movie. They NEED other actors to lean on. Which is perfect for an ensemble cast. Separate they are weak but together they are perfect and powerful.So let's look at this movie for example. It's just bland. Pine is no Bond, he is not Romeo, and he can't pass for an average Joe....so who is he, no one. After the events of 9/11 he enlists, only to be injured and taken out of it. He is later recruited to be a spy...or something. So bland. Also what is Keira Knightley doing in this movie? She is a great actress. But she plays a 'girlfriend'. How sad, reduced to a physical object. She is a doctor, sure. But she leaves it all to be with her man...oook? Even though he lied to her, what a weak woman they made her. She had to become his wife for him to tell her? Wow, very sexist. Makes me long for her days as the independent girl in ""Bend it like Beckham"" (2002). Very strong, now in this movie she is reduced to the role of 'the girlfriend' sad. Also why get rid of her accent? Half her charm went with it. Could she just be explained as a transfer student? Did NO thought go into this film? So yeah the film went as expected and was well made but who cares? When you were done, you did not want to watch it again, and almost immediately forgot about it as there was nothing really special about it.Now all the other actors of the reboot ST also have had bombs. Zoe Saldana - Colombiana, The Losers. Simon Pegg - The World's End, Paul. John Cho - Go On, Total Recall. Anton Yelchin - Like Crazy. Karl Urban - Almost Human. The reason is that these actors are best with other actors. They CAN'T carry a movie on their own, NOR do they have the fan bases to do so. Nu!Trek was a real boost to their careers. And for them to ignore it like that is scandalous! Don't bite the hand that feeds. It took FOUR years for the second installment of Nu!Trek to come out. WHAT!? A franchise that has the BEST fans...took FOUR YEARS!? Yet they pumped out Harry Potter/Twilight movies like they were going out of style.Now, even though the reboot was not really true Trek, it was better than nothing. ST fans are the best, we give everything a chance, we LOVE these characters and will follow them to the ends of the earth. So how do they reward us, by making us wait 4 YEARS for the next installment!? Yet they crank out worthless (rap movies trying to make these actors stars? Hate to break it to you, but it's just not gonna happen. Zachary Quinto seems to be faring the best, but outside of some guest roles and Heroes his future is unknown. As for his eyebrows being shaved off, I'm sure they can just put a bald cap type thing instead of him shaving it off, so if he wants to do side projects he can. I mean I hear it's 'tough' for them to make a ST TV show. What? They have made 2 futuristic TV shows in recent times Almost Human and Star-Crossed. What is hard about it? They already have all the sets...and it's not different than any other TV show. It will basically be a guaranteed success. So why are they content with only making ST movies?",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Sure the film includes most, if not all, of the Hollywood clichés: one man is smarter than everyone else, that same man can basically leap tall buildings in a single bound despite serious spinal rehab, massive gunfights play out in the streets with nary a policeman in sight, and so on. But Chris Pine has enough charisma to keep the viewer from losing interest.Of course, for a true fan of Tom Clancy's character, this Jack Ryan is far different than the earlier incarnations played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and even Ben Affleck. Perhaps that is why they needed to include his name in the title so that people would make the non- obvious connection to these earlier versions. Not that this Jack Ryan is less interesting, but he is different. Think more man of action rather than reluctant hero.Although the film did not do gangbusters at the box office, it did well enough that Mr. Pine should be able to add Jack Ryan to his resume as a second franchise character behind James T.

This is not a Jack Ryan movie as made famous by Alec Baldwin, or Harrison Ford or even Batman, err Ben Affleck. Chris Pine's version is an action version. Gone is the political intrigue, the subtlety, and the social commentary. Replacing it is terrorism and action, action, action!!! Think Mission Impossible meets early Die Hard. The cast is good, Pine is likable and believable, and Knightley and Coaster round out a solid supporting cast. Branagh feels a bit wasted in his role. He is good, but little is done to develop his character past a very thin stereotype. The action at least is believable. He is a ninja, but maybe only a purple belt. He does the impossible, but we believe he breaks a sweat to do it. This movie is fine. Forgettable, but fun. The director creates some genuine suspense.

163,Asentiff2004,I'm just an analyst,7,26 January 2014,"Jack Ryan a young but overtly intelligent CIA analyst uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy through a series of conspiracies and a terrorist attack plot.A thrilling movie with decent action, pacing and a story though not based on any Tom Clancy novel but with very close similarities to one. Chris Pine once again steps into another icon as he portrays Jack Ryan. Pine does an excellent job in his portrayal and is in this reviewers opinion a fantastic actor, though the show stealer is given a nod to Kenneth Branagh in his portrayal of Viktor Cherevin. Knightly does a decent job in her portrayal of Kathy Ryan, as does Costner in his portrayal of a very James Greer like character. Some may argue that this film is clichéd in almost every way and with some of its plot points i would agree, but if your not a fan of espionage socio-political suspense films, than this is truly not the film for you. There is action but not at the plots expense. Non Clancy fans will be introduced through this reboot to a Jack Ryan of modern times, and it will seem as an easy fit. Though being a Die Hard Clancy fan that I'am I found his introduction into the new world done well, Jack has been revamped with a harder edge than previous installments, with a tip of the hat to the same recourse's that made the character what he was in the original source material. Overall if the film were to stand on its own merits id say its a decent action suspense film, but with its roots seeped in the legacy and rich environment of Clancy's work id say this film is slightly better than the typical fare, though not the greatest Clancy based film. Overall a good film where its stronger points def outweigh some of its weaker elements.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

If you're just an action film fan with little to no knowledge of how Clancy developed this character over time, you'll probably enjoy it. It is a well acted, well written and well produced flick with the typical twists and plot turns that keep people in their seats.Jack is a financial analyst recruited by the CIA. That line is true in this interpretation and in our initial introduction to Ryan in Hunt for Red October. Only in this film's interpretation, Ryan doesn't come on board until after 9/11/01.But look... Ian Fleming died in 1964. The character of James Bond has evolved during the development of a vast franchise that persists 50 years after Fleming's death. There's no reason to think that the Jack Ryan character can't also evolve into a seemingly invincible, immortal superhero.But going back to my first point--if you're a Clancy purist, this film's story line is going to upset you from the get go.

165,dutchs-1,Nice Mix of Brain and Brawn,8,18 February 2014,"Another take on Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan. His backstory is told briskly in a montage of him watching 9/11 on TV, quitting graduate school and joining the Marines, being shot down and wounded, and struggling to recover. During his recovery he meets his future love (Keira Knightly) and is recruited as a covert economic analyst by the CIA. While working a dual career with the CIA and a Wall Street firm, he discovers a pattern of massive transfers of funds, which turns out to be a plot to stage a terrorist attack and then dump trillions of dollars of U.S. securities. The plot alternates between action and fairly intense intelligence analysis. The chemistry between Ryan and his CIA handler (Kevin Costner) is appealing; they like and respect each other.Some of the dumbest commentary on this film was by people angry that the villains weren't Muslims. They were annoyed that the American operatives were operating out of a Russian Orthodox Church. Apart from being a message drop, the Russian Orthodox Church isn't involved in the plot at all. And when the operatives are activated, they say ""slava Bogu"" (praise God) instead of praising Allah. Because knowing that ""slava Bogu"" is a common Russian expression for any welcome news is beyond their cultural horizons.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

There was none. They could have just sent him home.2) Ryan's girlfriend is beyond annoying. She plays the part of the lame brained ""but smart looking"" financial markets female. The relationship is so forced on screen that it's painful to watch.3) For a guy who is in the CIA, you'd think that these clowns would be organized. Instead, it's like the Jack Ryan superman show because one minute they are all over the place and the next they allow things to happen like what did right at the start of the movie in Russia.I could go on and I've just covered the first 20-30 minutes of this incredibly lame film.

Nothing is out-right terrible here, its just been done better before and in the end it feels as if a computer wrote it, there isn't any flair for set pieces or interesting characters, Costner, Pine and Knightly are all wasted with what is essentially dialogue to get from A to B, from start to finish and thats it.

I thought there were some really well done, tense action sequences; the Moscow bathroom fight (hinted at in the trailer) was impressive and well choreographed. The plot wasn't overly complicated (a common problem with thrillers) and the soundtrack kept the film moving at a brisk pace. The movie certainly wasn't boring, not at all. Unfortunately what brings this film down are the performances as they were quite vanilla. The characters lacked any real emotion and were unconvincing. Throughout the film it just kind of felt like they were going through the motions and at no point did I feel the end was ever really in doubt (it wraps up nicely at the end, unsurprisingly).

169,lhunt-9,"Haha... I'm sorry, the financial terrorism scenario is laughable",5,17 August 2014,"I recently watched Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. As a Kenneth Branagh production, I was expecting something pretty sophisticated. My quick take... Mr. Branagh (or Mr. Clancy) should have taken a few minutes to talk to somebody on Wall Street before finalizing the ""Dr. Evil"" story line. I say this as somebody who has been an active investor for the past 15 years or so. The basic premise of the film is that the Russians are going to launch the US into a second Great Depression first by driving up the market price of the US Dollar, and then by selling off their US Dollar hoard, while also blowing up Wall Street. Let me point out a couple of holes in the plot. (1) The Russians are basically buying high and selling low. Usually, this is a way to lose YOUR OWN money, not somebody else's. (2) The US Dollar was gaining ""several cents a week."" Sorry, in the real world, several cents per YEAR is a big move in the currency markets. (3) I'm sure Goldman Sachs was happily selling dollars to the Russians at levels above long-term market trends. Wall Street is full of traders who would be game for that play. And you have to know that the shorts would be piling on in such a market dynamic as well, so the Russians would have had a large coterie of counterparties hanging on as the US Dollar topped. (4) When the Russians start selling off their dollars, the price will fall, as correctly described in the movie. However, it is the Russians themselves who are losing on the falling price. So they now plan to be out billions or trillions on this so-called act of financial self-sabotage. (5) Then they are going to blow up Wall Street. That brings with it a few other problems: (a) world markets would certainly close in response to such an act, thus there would be no venue in which to carry out the planned trade; (b) the suspicious selling activity linked to an act of terrorism would be investigated; and (c) Don't all of us know that Wall Street brings no value to the market in the first place, as their main job is to see how big a piece of the action they can keep for themselves so wouldn't things actually get better if Wall Street blew up? (I'm not advocating it, but the shutdown of Wall Street would not carry with it any immediate harms for Main Street, apart from the need to develop an alternative clearinghouse for bank activity, which could certainly be done.) (6) Finally, at the end of the envisioned Russian strategy, (a) the Russians would now be broke, having sold off their assets at below-trend prices; (b) Goldman-Sachs would be back as a counterparty, this time buying up all the cheap US Dollars; and (c) let's not forget that Warren Buffett wouldn't want to miss that trade either – a long-term bet on the resiliency of the US economy! So, I cannot deny that I was actually laughing my way through the ""financial terrorism"" aspect of the plot, as the holes were big enough to sink the Titanic. There were a couple of other odd things about the film, too. Jack Ryan underwent a spinal fracture/spinal cord injury in Afghanistan, and he then meets Keira Knightly as the medical student who pushes him through his therapy and rehabilitation. This is all great. But at the end of the film, he was doing Jackie Chan types of stunts, which establishes him perhaps as the world's most successful example of recovery from spinal injury. So, in balance, this was light entertainment at best. The scenery and camera-work were a nice aspect, but I for one had trouble suspending disbelief, if not outright laughter.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
170,thomas-w15,Waste of Chris Pine's talent...,3,23 January 2015,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit 3/10- Chris Pine is an underrated actor. I have no clue why people do not like him because I have not seen a movie with him where he does a bad job. Jack Ryan is no exception. Chris Pine practically saves this movie from the terrible script writing and unfunny jokes. I will admit though that this movie is nothing more than a regular action flick.This movie starts out well giving the origin of how everything came to be and showing how a soon to be doctor became an operational analyst for the CIA. They bring in Kevin Costner and Keira Knightley into the film with good sense of awareness and realism. Unfortunately, after these characters were introduced, these actors added nothing to the movie. Kiera Knightley, who plays Cathy Muller, came to the big screen in what seems to be a while since the last Pirates film, but sadly it is obvious that she is a little rusty when it comes to potential blockbuster films. Kevin Costner, who plays the CIA vet William Harper, seems like he was not really even trying to do a decent job and it looks like he thought that he is such a good actor that he just has to show up. Sadly, no actor is that good. Now, again Chris Pine, who obviously plays Jack Ryan, is the only really good part of the movie and Jack Ryan is an example of all the potential he has.The screenplay to this movie was terrible. The writers kept with uninteresting sequences too long and did not capitalize on the amazing scenes. i will say that the fighting in Jack Ryan is pretty cool, but they have so many that after you see something a bunch of times, it gets boring because it never gets any better. Thee trailer to this movie was misleading to say the least. Jack Ryan is one of those movies where the trailer looks amazing but the film is a let down. The movie just never seems to go to the next level, it starts off with such great potential, but it just throws it all away towards the end. Still, awards season is over and we are back to the movies that are just made for entertainment and do not expect to win any Oscars. Jack Ryan is a decent enough popcorn action film that when you walk out of the theater you still have at least enjoyed watching the movie. If you want to see an action film, go see Lone Survivor, but if you have already seen that, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit will be decent enough for the action movie goers.

171,heykateforever,Excellent Action Movie,10,14 June 2014,"I'm not going to go into plot and all since the 170 so reviews before this one have pretty much already described that. I am writing this review because of my absolute shock at the level of negative reviews on this movie. Did all the haters write reviews or what?No, this isn't an artsy far$$y, coming of age, politically correct, message-of-the-day type of movie I want to BURN in a pile because it seems that is all that is coming out these days. Henry Cavill and Bruce Willis just did a similar (not quite as good) movie recently (sorry the name isn't coming to me) and it got torched by snooty reviewers, too. I, for one, was delighted to just sit and watch a great action movie with eye candy, Chris Pine, as the lead. Something that was highly entertaining, full of great action, and NO POLITICAL BS to wade through. This movie was simply fun. I say that for all of you naysayers, for crying out loud, don't be so piggy. Some of us still want to see the thriller movies like the original Jack Ryan movies and the Lethal Weapon. I understand about violence and making the poor Russians look bad (per one reviewer - really? Do you NOT read or watch the news??? Putin must have cried at the end that the plot failed - no spoiler - we WATCH these movies because some of us are still realists and understand that Russia has been heavily financing the terrorists in Syria, Afghanistan, and now Iraq). It was wonderful to see a good old good guys (U.S.) vs. bad guys movie and the good guys win!!!!Geez, people. Not everything has to be centered around some relevant principle you all here seem to want. This movie was meant to be entertainment and it got 10 stars from me because it fulfilled that Bill very well for me. I, personally, hope to see more of these wonderful, armchair gripping thrillers coming out of the entertainment industry in the future. I miss them!! Thank you Sir Kenneth Branagh for the great entertainment - don't let the haters stop you from making another exciting movie! I think I speak for most average people here. If we want complicated drama, we'll live our everyday life. When we go to the theater, pay the big bucks, most of us want to leave that heavy drama at the door and simply be entertained for a couple hours!",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

174,therunner42,Won't Win An Oscar But You'll Have Fun Anyway,10,27 January 2014,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is an exciting movie that won't win any awards but makes for a really fun afternoon. It tells the story of Jack Ryan (obviously) and his life as a CIA agent from recruitment to operational. It avoids cliché and the acting is believable. Chris Pine stars as Jack Ryan and he really brings this character life. This is possibly his biggest role to date but things are clearly on the horizon. He has a true screen charisma. Kevin Costner has also brought the magic as Ryan's mentor. Kiera Knightley stars as his love interest and she also creates real drama. I am not sure if it is poor wardrobe choices or a directorial decision to play down her looks but the costuming of her character is awful and a lot of opportunities are missed. That is the only bad thing one can say about his film. It has action, laughs and a fair bit of emotional drama. I loved it.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
175,razvan-rogoz,Capitalizes on the Tom Clancy brand ...,2,1 February 2014,"And yet another Tom Clancy movie There are two ways to review this movie, from the POV of someone who read the book(s) and from someone who didn't. I'll do both.As someone who had just read the last book from Tom Clancy (or whoever wrote it) this movie makes no sense. There is no real relationship from the plot of the movie to the world of Tom Clancy and it's only very loosely based on it. The only aspect that is somehow related to the book is his occupation but that's about all. I don't know if this is about Jack Ryan Jr. or Sr. but it doesn't even matter. If it wasn't for the name, this wouldn't have been a Tom Clancy movie at all.So story wise, setting wise, if you are expecting this to be a good representation of the Tom Clancy universe, like ""The Hunt for Red October"" or even ""The Sum of All Fears"", this is not it.From this POV it gets 1/10 points.The second one is as a movie itself. It was not really awful but it was not good either. It stretched too long, it was a bit melodramatic (""I've got to tell you something - dramatic music sequence - I work for the CIA. Her: Thank god, I thought you were cheating on me) and the suspension of disbelief is Empire State Building high here.The story is not realistic at all (I think it can be pulled off but there was not one single element to make it look like anything more than a bad plot, almost in the SF sphere without the science in it) and it tried to hard to be a Jason Bourne meets technothriller meets current world affairs type of deal.By the ⅓ of the movie I was bored. By the ⅔ I wanted to go home but I've paid the movie ticket. If it had lasted 10 minutes longer, I would have simply left. Again, it's not awful. Some scenes are good but there are subplots who are simply forgotten, it doesn't feel like it has any type of continuity and overall, it is BORING.I'm a fan of Tom Clancy and I've read about 6 - 7 of his books. I also think I've seen every ecranisation of one of his books. This was the worst.From a movie POV it gets 4/10 and this only because it tried to have high production values. It tried. The only good part that was likable was the climax scene but even that seemed rough and unfinished.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
176,John K.-2,Not the Jack Ryan we know and love; and not a very good spy thriller,5,24 January 2014,"I'm a fan of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books and I have enjoyed most of the previous films based on his work. I expected this to be the first film based on the recent series of books about Jack Ryan Junior, but it wasn't; it was a ""reboot"" of the original Jack Ryan, in which he first meets Cathy. The whole plot is time-shifted to 2013, probably so they could save money by not having to make places look old, and so they could have modern day product placement (unless they had Windows 8 mobile phones in the 1970s). Okay, so I tried to watch the film as a stand-alone spy thriller. But such films have to fall into one of three camps to be successful: they have to be non stop action; or they have to be incredibly atmospheric (like Skyfall, or perhaps Mission Impossible); or they have to do gritty realism (like the Bourne films). This film fell between all three stools. I actually walked out after an hour or so, and there had only been one action sequence up to that point; the atmospheric shots were nothing special; and the realism was damaged by the rushed set-up sequences (twelve years in ten minutes), and especially by the stereotyped villain. In his first scene, we are introduced to the back of his head; he takes drugs; he kicks his subordinates; and he has significant tattoos. All he needs to be the complete clichéd bad guy is to wear uncool and unnecessary dark glasses. As for the acting, you get the feeling the actors are all doing the best with the material they've been given, but I still found myself thinking of the name of the actor/actress whenever I saw them instead of their character -- which is a very bad sign. Chris Pine (as Ryan) appeared to have been told to look like a dork who's out of his depth; he did that successfully, but it's just not very interesting.Oh, and there's no tongue in cheek humour, either, from anybody. Please, bring back Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham to give the film something to make it watchable.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
177,swellframe17,A passable reboot.,6,12 July 2014,"2 1/2 out of 4 stars.First, there was Alec Baldwin, then Harrison Ford, then Ben Affleck, and now, Chris Pine. Kenneth Branagh's ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is a reboot of the Jack Ryan series with Pine playing the famous CIA agent. I haven't read the Jack Ryan books by Tom Clancy, but I have seen all of the film adaptations of Jack Ryan. It's been 12 years since we last saw Jack Ryan in ""The Sum of All Fears"" and Hollywood thought it was time we saw him again. ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is a passable spy thriller unfortunately. Jack Ryan gets a new origin story. We see him in England at 9/11 and his short career as a U.S. Marine. It goes through these pretty fast so he can meet Cathy Muller (played by Keira Knightley) and eventually join the CIA thanks to Thomas Harper (played by Kevin Costner). Zoom to present day, Ryan discovers the Russians are up to something and investigates Viktor Cherevin (played by Kenneth Branagh).This film rushes through the exposition and tries to make Jack Ryan seem more relevant or contemporary to modern audiences. It brings Ryan into a post-9/11 world and looks at themes revolving around terrorist attacks in U.S. cities and the 2008 financial crisis. It's not necessarily bad, but it doesn't bring anything new or thought provoking. I'm not sure why they chose a Russian villain instead of North Korea or something.Pine is fine as Ryan. Knightley puts an American accent on and Branagh puts a Russian accent on. Branagh probably has the best performance as the villainous Cherevin. There's a few laughs and gags about marriage and Russians, but they put a lot of those moments were in the trailers. The story is predictable and the action is alright. It's a good film to see if you have nothing else to watch. It's not good or bad. It's a passable reboot.I found myself disappointed that Branagh directed this. He did such epic and great films like ""Hamlet"" and ""Henry V."" I even liked his version of ""Thor."" However, ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" isn't Branagh at his directing best.2014 is just not a good year for reboots. ""Godzilla"" was okay and I avoided ""Robocop."" ""Jack Ryan: Shaodw"" is just an okay spy thriller. It tries to be contemporary and put Jack Ryan back on the Hollywood grid, but it just didn't work as well. I did like it a little more than ""The Sum of All Fears."" If you want to see a Jack Ryan film at its best, I'd recommend ""The Hunt for Red October"" or one of the Harrison Ford films.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

So long that, when the movie title finally came on screen, I had the feeling we were already watching for 10 minutes. It was a little bit annoying that when you think you are following a story every time it's cut to jump forward a few years. We need (some) of the info that's given here, but it could have been done so much faster and still be clear. Well, after the story finally starts it is an enjoyable movie. The tension builds up and the chemistry between Chris Pine, Keira Knightley and Kevin Costner is there. Kenneth Branagh, who is also the director, plays the villain and he does it well. He's brutal and his eyes shoot fire when he feels betrayed. The dialogues are good and the action scenes are nice. I guess there's been a cut scene some towards the end, because there is a minor gap in the story, almost at the end when Jack Ryan saves the day.

180,miroslavhradel,An entertaining thriller with a familiar plot,8,2 November 2020,"Shadow Recruit comes with a plot that can be described as a mixed bag of stereotypical tropes, fairly believable outcomes and a predictable conclusion.The characters follow a similar concept as the plot, thus creating a group of familiar figures that one expects to see in a spy flick that focuses on a Russian plot against the United States. However, the performances are for the most part good enough to make the viewer forget about the insufficient character development.Furthermore, a big plus lies in the fact that the Russian characters do speak Russian among themselves at all times, instead of forcefully using English like in so many similar movies these days.Finally, there are several exciting chases and fights that are reminiscent of the Jason Bourne movies and contribute to the fact that Shadow Recruit generally turns out to be a gripping and entertaining thriller.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
181,simondclinch-1,"Plot full of holes, but good action",6,5 June 2014,"This film is stylish enough, plays well, but is unsuitable for the intelligent viewer owing to the mistakes in the research.We see Tom Clancy in the credits, but it wasn't clear to me how much Clancy was involved in this. It certainly doesn't match up to the realism Clancy is famous for.The action works okay; the problem is with the background to the action. Perhaps the most amusing gaffe is that the funds being used by a black Russian operation for the short deal alone, supposedly without the knowledge of the Russian government are significantly more than Russia's current GDP (gross domestic product). Somehow I think someone would notice if more than 1.5 x GDP were being moved to offshore accounts. In any case, it's much more than could conceivably be raised for the whole Russian public sector in a year's national budget.There is no proper foundation for the CIA team to identify Victor's son as one of the attack team. It goes from ""what if he didn't die"" to therefore it must be him. One might as well say, ""what if ... anything chosen at random that ISN'T supposed to be true and then conclude the identity of the team from that. Complete nonsense.The story of the conflict starts with the Americans refusing to prevent a Turkish gas pipeline into eastern Europe. In reality, it already happened in 2009 - a trickle of gas from Azerbaijan is exported through Turkey into Eastern Europe. But Azerbaijan ranks no. 40 with negligible output compared to Russia being the no.1 gas exporter in the world with nearly 13 figure output per year in cubic metres. So the film's proposition that the ""new"" pipeline (which it isn't) would lower the world's oil prices and damage Russia's economy is a case of connecting nonexistent dots on a nonexistent map.Similarly, no research or knowledge is applied in regard to the financial side of the plot. For example, you don't need full cash value to bet against the market, only a margin. Also, margin calls which perversely do appear later in the film, aren't public information - margin is a private deal varying in percentage and subject to deal- and counterparty-specific terms. So that can't be available as exchange information because there is no information about them that is consistent across a whole market or exchange, so it cannot be meaningfully reported.Also the trading sequence is all wrong. If you know a disaster is going to happen, then you open the positions BEFORE the event, by short selling, buying puts or writing calls and you close the position much later after the market has moved. In the film, Victor is waiting for the disaster before selling. That doesn't make sense.Given that the execution of the film is good, it is a pity that a little research wasn't done before running off at the mouth with the silly plot.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

188,filmfanperspective,"By the numbers, but exactly what you want (***)",6,5 May 2015,"It used to be that 'origin' stories were reserved for those in spandex. Now, any fictional character can get the reboot treatment, whether it's Alex Cross, James Bond, or the late Tom Clancy's recurring hero Jack Ryan. With classically trained British legend Kenneth Branagh at the helm and cutting his villain chops, and charismatic everyman Chris Pine taking the role, we should expect, at bare minimum, an efficient machine of a film. That's exactly what ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is: formulaic, safe, but still fun and well-made, resulting in a middling-to-good action/espionage film reboot.Four solid to very good films featuring the character were made before this, not to mention the multiple Tom Clancy novels written from 1984 to the present featuring the Jack Ryan character. It has always been a film franchise in a state of flux, however, with the lead never committing long-term, Paramount never quite satisfied with the middling-to-positive box office returns, and an inconsistent story line. With this reboot, they have a chance to start from scratch, and there is a plethora of rich source material to pluck ideas from (I enjoy the meticulously detailed Tom Clancy novels). Of course, it stands to reason that they would choose to film from an entirely original screenplay instead of adapting one of the novels. In a way, it makes sense, considering the novels describe Ryan's history over various stories, with nothing concrete in the way of an origin.It also stands to reason that an espionage film set after 2001 would have to take into account the heightened tension level in the intelligence community. Ergo, the creative decision is made to have the 9/11 attack be the onus for Jack Ryan joining the military, where he excels in seeing patterns develop, and being a leader. While rehabbing after his chopper goes down in the Afghan mountains (definitely a nod to the novels), he meets spirited medical resident Cathy Muller (Knightley), who seems to give him the ""right motivation"" to heal. Also scoping out Ryan is Thomas Harper (Costner), who gives him the extra push to finish his doctorate and go to work for the CIA as an analyst. Harper is the classic mentor character, something Costner is becoming more familiar with as he ages.Of course, being an 'analyst' is rather vague, and we know that Jack is basically going to become a field agent- not just because we're familiar with the character, but the plot needs him to be more than that. A lot more. We're quickly shifted in the film to ten years after his rehab, and Jack's living with Cathy (now a practicing physician), well-entrenched in Wall Street working for a firm, and in the thick of things as a CIA analyst. I guess we'll have to assume that Jack and Cathy had a magical courtship, as the film doesn't bother. Jack has done what he does best- discover a pattern, and a disturbing one at that- there are multiple hidden accounts with large dollar amounts belonging to a Russian corporation headed by Viktor Cherevin (Branagh). We know this is dirty money, because Branagh is a name actor, and thus his intentions must be evil.Those new to the story will at least be able to gather that Ryan is an ultra-bright, resourceful, kind, and valuable boy scout of a character. He's the reluctant spy. In essence, that's what this film does well- it sets us up for future Jack Ryan outings by giving us an incredibly likable character played by an incredibly likable actor. It's debatable whether or not we should buy into Chris Pine as a borderline tactical genius, even if he's also Captain Kirk (which I don't necessarily buy, either). I do buy him as a charismatic good man, though, which sells more movie tickets. Branagh does all he can to breathe some evil nuance into the Cherevin character, whose motivations are typical (he even sneaks in a ""Mother Russia"" for good measure). The one who seems out-of-place here is Keira Knightley; she's a fine actress that I've enjoyed in many different roles, but something about her version of Cathy Muller (Ryan?) isn't right. She's just so lithe. Perhaps comparing her to Anne Archer's take on the character isn't the best idea, but I sensed someone like Rachel McAdams belonged in the role instead.I sense there will always be a crowd for films like this- the international espionage thriller. I for one am a sucker for them (and an unabashed fan of the Ryan character), and even done half- heartedly (I'm looking at you, ""The Bourne Legacy"") I'll be inclined to enjoy them. When the stakes are higher, it lends a gravity to a film, and all of the Jack Ryan stories have that specific weight to them. ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is not special by any means, and compared to the best in the franchise, ""The Hunt For Red October"", it pales in comparison. You'll have to suspend some disbelief to enjoy this film (how would the world NOT notice if Russia bought up all the U.S. currency and then dumped it right after a terrorist attack?). However, as an origin story/reboot/franchise starter, it's effective enough in its' mechanical nature to make me recommend it, based on the relative sharpness of the script, the decent action sequences, and in what it does best- exist as an international espionage film. People are constantly looking over their shoulders in this film, which is right at home in the genre, and a solid set up for the future.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
189,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,Chris Pine keeps an average movie from being terrible.,5,16 January 2014,"Let's get the good parts out of the way first:Chris Pine.OK, now that we got that out of the way...WHAT THE HELL, JACK RYAN SHADOW RECRUIT???Listen, in going over what really bothered me about this movie, I sort of have to spoil some of it. So, before I do that, let me just quickly summarize: Chris Pine proves himself as a good, maybe even great action lead, but the story is so bare-bones and straight-forward (and at times, stupid) that Pine's performance is really the only justifiable reason to watch this. Shaky cameras during fight scenes DO NOT help the cause either. (Seriously, this is such a pet peeve when it comes to action movies, why do we still deal with this?) Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit scores a 2.5 out of 5 on The BDBOS. Now, take this as your warning: BEYOND THIS POINT WILL BE SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.Show of hands...how many of you guys out there have seen the trailer for this movie? The trailer hints at - and by ""hints at"", I mean ""beats you over the head with"" - the idea that no one can be trusted. Specifically, the trailer shows Keira Knightley's character (Jack Ryan's love interest) apparently betraying Jack. The trailer also shows Kevin Costner's character (Jack's mentor and superior) aiming at Jack through the scope of a sniper rifle. Even the movie poster has the tag line ""Trust No One"". So, you'd figure going in that you're in for some serious double-crossing and not knowing who's on Jack's side, right?No.Literally, there is NO DOUBLE-CROSSING WHAT-SO-EVER in this movie. The good guys from the beginning stay good the whole way through. Same with the bad guys. As a matter of fact, there are way more people in this movie you CAN TRUST than there are of the opposite. Apparently, the ""trust no one"" warning was meant for the villain, since he's the only one that gets deceived in any way. The line should have been ""Trust no one...if you're a terrorist.""Still not sure who to trust? There's another easy way to figure out who's good and bad in this movie, and all you need is this simple equation: American=good. Not American=bad. Again, a better tag line would have been ""Trust no one...unless they speak perfect English without any foreign accent.""Now, some questions...If you're an assassin, and you're only job is to kill this guy...shouldn't you be killing the guy at your first opportunity? Or your second? Or third? And not HOURS LATER, after the guy learns that you're carrying a gun? If you're a different assassin, and you've already used your trademark knife to kill a few other people...where was your knife when you had to fight the hero? Who was UNARMED during the fight???If you've had severe spinal surgery, and went through months of intense rehab just to be able to walk again...and, for argument's sake, you're on a speeding motorcycle that SLAMS into the side of a van...how are you then able to get up, walk away, and continue to chase the bad guy???Will they let ANYONE into your hotel room if they simply claim to be your wife? Without ANY sort of proof??Is Jack Ryan the SMARTEST PERSON EVER??? Because everyone else in the CIA seem like morons.How many people did they send to Moscow for this mission??? It seemed like there were 47 people on the street that were all in on the operation, and yet the inexperienced financial officer who had reconstructive spinal surgery and never killed anyone is the guy they send in for ALL the dirty work. Listen, with action movies, you're often asked to suspend disbelief for the sake of enjoyment, but Shadow Recruit took too many liberties for my liking. And, after all the promotion for the film, I left the theater wondering if I saw the right movie. ""Trust no one...except everyone.""Chris Pine, this wasn't your fault. 2.5 out of 5.

Of corse Russians again criminals with tattoos, ""special agent"" former US navy with A+ grades in the university and he is full in love in a nurse who is helping to him in a hospital... .. Nevertheless I think casting is worst as it could be. Chris Pine is a ""special agent"" (in the ""This Means War"" Yes!), Kenneth Branagh compare that he is director, he is also rough Russian guy (with British style), Keira Knightley is not panacea and her beauty could not save the movie unfortunately, same as Kevin Costners experience.

194,mitcherator777,Great Movie,8,18 January 2014,"I don't know what everyone is else is complaining about maybe I haven't read the book like they did and it's not as good as that. Well I gotta be honest I haven't read the book but I enjoyed this movie very much. There were several points in the movie I was caught up in what was happening as it was happening so fast at the time. I also thought even though some things like were happening and Jack Ryan had to save the world and we were breathless and in awe when we saw what happened. I honestly thought the characters were pretty developed and even though its not a 10 star movie in my opinion i thought it was a pretty decent action thriller movie. There isn't to much to complain about this movie sure its not perfect, but what movie is, honestly people quit comparing the movie to the book you already know the movie won't be like the book. Overall i really liked this movie and its one i would consider watching again just to get back into the feel for what was going on. Highly recommended movie",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
195,michael-sengwah,Just decent,6,29 January 2014,"Mr. Jack in this film does not have much actions compared to Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher, but the dramatic narration of financing crime-terrorist thriller is something quite refreshing and unexpectedly not quite boring. However, with a strong list of cast and a thrilling score, the climax itself progresses over fast and unexciting, but the beauty of Keira Knightley and her conversation scene with Kenneth Branagh surprisingly appears to be the most lasting impression in mind. While the story is pretty much straightforward, not much to anticipate from this common style of cinematography and story telling. Common flaws appear in the plot but that's still a decent thriller to check out if there is no other great films for option.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
196,c-conley90,"Meh Movie, but still very watchable.",5,5 December 2015,"I know two faced in my review of this movie. On one had, it's rather dry as far as Jack Ryan movies go. Hell, it doesn't have a football stadium blowing up in it like Sum of All Fears. Chris Pine is good, Kevin Costner is excellent, Keira Knightley is playing sort of a damsel in distress at parts of this?!! OK, this kind of blindsides me after years of Pirates of the Caribbean movies where she could kick some person's ass if she wanted to. The director is the bad guy. Oh wait, sorry Spoilers! He's actually not bad as a sleazy Russian extremist terrorist. His end is however a letdown. The action scenes are great, but again the whole movie as a whole is a meh. I would watch it again, if I need a fast paced Spy Thriller to watch. I can see why this bombed and it never saw a sequel.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
197,brandtair,Real Rus. vs U.S. action movie,8,25 October 2015,"Great action movie with a good way to keep some mystery into the story by foreign language's. Keeps the suspense right the whole movie. Great way how a soldier gets in contact with the CIA and how the whole situation evolves from there. No too much illogical development of the movie. realistic ways of suspicion by the characters and as i said earlier the movie keeps evolving logical and clear. Chris Pine did a fine job in expressing body language mostly important in the beginning of the movie, as does the actress that is in my opinion the best of the last decade. I'm talking of course about Kiera Knightley. Kiera Knightley and Kevin Costner Should have gotten more text. Kiera Knightley exiles in her on screen body language but these two have the power of convincing people with their words.THE WORST DECISION MADE IN THIS MOVIE:THE STILING AND MAKE UP OF KIERA KNIGHTLEY. THE STILIST AND MAKE UP ARTIST HAVE DONE THEIR WORK REALLY BAD. The make up wasn't too heavy which i can appreciate but then the make up around the eyes was too dark and the lipstick too light. The stiling was even worse. They have chosen to make heavy fabric that fall loose but geometric over the body. While thin fit people like Kiera are the best sort of people you can get for tight fit clothing and small dresses.Only that makes me decide that they don't deserve a 9 but an 8.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
198,jimj40,It Just Goes To Show...,1,28 August 2018,"These days it seems that even well-known actors simply don't care what they appear in as long as their names and faces are on-screen and the cash keeps rolling in.This is another of those well below average, you've seen it all before pot-boilers* with the same old, same old characters, a ""plot"" that you've seen a hundred or more times before, and dialog and acting that would disgrace a high school remedial acting class.*The problem is that a pot-boiler is supposed to cater to ""popular taste"": please tell me that there aren't people out there whose taste is so stultified that they actually enjoy seeing the same film made over and over and over again with the same stupid and lacklustre characters, the plot that was never really novel or interesting the very first time it was made, and the same actors whose careers are so clearly on the skids that they'll take any role in anything to make a few extra bucks before their names are worth nothing and the only time you'll see them is in the ""Whatever Happened To"" features in obscure magazines.DON'T watch this movie, even if you find it in the Bargain Bucket at your local thrift shop: it truly isn't worth wasting even a moment of your life on or taking the risk of losing some brain cells by trying to work out the final plot twist - there isn't a real plot and there certainly isn't any twist...",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
199,jkm0119,Good movie just out of context,6,3 November 2014,The movie is very intense and worth watching but I would not take the motive of the movie to be worthwhile. It has the old theme of the cold war that Russia is the enemy. The real enemy and the ones who do terrorists threats is not Russia but Islam. This would have been more realistic if it was set in an Islamic country but we must make the old hatred new and say Russians are the enemy. The photography is good and the acting is very good. It is the message that is not good. I give it a six because the message is bad. This is 2014 and Russia is not threatening the world with terror and has never threatened the world with terror. The movie ignores who the the real terrorists are and tries to focus on Russia rather than than the real terrorists. Is it worth watching? Yes but insert Islam for Russia and you can get the point.,Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
200,paparay,Entertaining... Why else watch a thriller like this one?,9,9 January 2015,"I rated this film pretty high since for me it was quite exciting and had some romance in it. Seeing all the big name actors and actress made it somewhat unrealistic, but I would recommend this to folks I know who just want to be entertained and don't care about details that are less than totally realistic. You know that the good guys are going to win in the end, but that doesn't matter. I felt the action scenes were well enough done that I found myself gripping my chair sometimes. I wanted the bad guy(s) to get another kick when they finally got what was coming to them. I watched it on Netflix, so I didn't pay the price for a theater ticket to see it, but I really would have felt I got my money's worth if I HAD paid to see it... it was that good.

201,aegiswiz-accede,Not for the dramatically insecure.,7,14 June 2014,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit =A Tom Clancy Character= I almost didn't watch this due to creepy crawlers whining about it. This movie delivers exactly what it intends to deliver. Tension, action, suspense for 105 minutes. For the diapered whiny Columbia University film critics, try Metamucil for that groaning issue. Seriously.Folks that want this kind of movie are going to enjoy it. It isn't your latest cinematography with deep meaning and brilliant lighting, costume, and music for the Jane Austen crowd. This is grab-a-beer-with-the-guys, grunt and point appropriately while smiling and nodding your head kind of movie where you and your buddies walk off after the movie a little closer for sharing the experience and all that means in 'the guy world' that the hyper critical intellects will never understand.This is NOT the best portrayal of Tom Clancy's character which has been done excellently in previous outings, but the idea of Chris Pine (Star Trek Captain) wasn't a horrible choice.A word to the wise..., the attempt at romance in this movie that is trying to bring in the chick audience fails miserably... listen to your gal and go with what she suggests if that's what you're shooting for... this isn't a compromise movie. Let her win and see the romance movie.

202,thefilmguy7,Not Jack Ryan,6,19 January 2014,"It's ironic that ""Jack Ryan"" is part of the title for this one because this is the furthest from the character that any of the films have been. Beyond a some what similar back-story, the doctor soon to be wife, and that he works for the CIA, Ryan is not Ryan. They turn him more into a spy/field agent than the brainy analyst that he's meant to be. As a result, there is nothing in this movie that makes it stand out from the rest of it's genre. It's just another spy movie with an over the top villain that's plotting world domination. It's predictable and generic. They sacrificed what made the Jack Ryan character unique. I'm not saying that the movie didn't work as some Bond/Bourne/Mission Impossible wannabe with bits and pieces slapped together from every spy thriller ever made. It captured successful elements from those films pretty well. It's just a shame that they relied on recycling tired and over used narrative when there is still a bunch of great Ryan books that they have yet to adapt. There should be no reason to slap together this films story when a much more talented writer like Clancy still has more stories to draw from. I agree with Peter Travers comment ""It's a product constructed out of spare parts and assembled with computerized precision.""Despite following a predictable formula very closely instead of the source material, the movie still works as entertainment. Chris Pine is great, despite the writers failing him, and he really carries the movie. He could be a great Jack Ryan if they actually wrote the character correctly. Branagh delivers a pretty good villain, even though he's more suited for a Bond film. There are a couple of scenes that deliver good suspense. It's just not a Jack Ryan movie. It seems that they only used Jack Ryan for the brand name rather than faithfully trying to tell a story about him.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
203,a-h-guicherit,Entertaining film,8,2 November 2020,"A nice and entertaining film. Chris Pine is OK for the role. The others too. The only disappointment is the script.

204,tariq-hossenbux,Formulaic and Bland... But Watchable,6,23 June 2014,"After enjoying other films in this franchise, I was eager to see if a Chris Pine reboot would restore life to this series. Unfortunately what I found was a formulaic going through the action film paces routine. You won't find much in the way of high tech wizardry, thrilling plot twists, or even consistently good chemistry between Pine and Knightley. And it's a shame because there was plenty of opportunity for it in it's close to 2 hours of running time.Pine is bland as a non super agent Jack Ryan, and his opposite number Kenneth Branagh is not quite evil enough as would be terrorist mastermind Viktor Cherevin. Costner does play the role of quiet CIA spy father well though.The plot has too many hardly believable coincidences benefiting the protagonists, and could have used more intense action sequences. It's hopes for audience engagement probably rest on enduring American fears of terrorist attacks. Overall though the film is still watchable and a passable spy thriller that doesn't require a lot of thinking to keep track of.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Almost as bad as making sourpuss HArrison Ford Jack Ryan.Anyway like the books of clancy...going downhill. And Jack Ryan is such a great character. The idealistic technocrat all American hero. Rich,smart, beautiful independent successful wife and 2 kids. One boy and girl. Even his family is picture perfect. Not a womanizer...so no worries abut it being pg13. He should be an over the top picture perfect hero. To be honest...a young Kevin Costner would have been perfect. He can act so earnest and idealistic. Makes it believable. Matter of fact he would have been better suited instead of Harrison Ford or he should just do a reboot with an older Jack Ryan. There is an existing story line that ends with him as US president.Plenty of enemies to choose and make nice story. Russioan president who is KGB. China gaining power and flexing their muscles and of course always the Islamic enemies. So i say re re boot it...bring us the heroe from the original books. Than make up your own story.

Not many and not this one.This movie delivers thrills, action, suspense and good characters. I could have done without Ryan's girlfriend who didn't add a lot to the movie for me but big deal.The threat facing the US is interesting and a new twist on the Russian threat but it doesn't really matter what the threat is, the film works for what it is, a popcorn movie and a pleasant afternoon diversion.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
208,gumperman,Best Jack Ryan on Film? Maybe.,8,22 February 2014,"From the trailers, it seems like Keira Knightley's character will betray Jack Ryan at some point during the film, so I was expecting it the whole time I was watching the film, only for it to never happen. So that was just a personal misunderstanding I had, but a pleasant surprise. That aside, I thought this was a very good edge of your seat thriller with enjoyable performances and cinematography. Was it the best Jack Ryan film ever made, I don't think so, but it was one of the more entertaining and easier to follow plot lines. Though it could be that I haven't watched the first three, never saw The Sum of All Fears, since I was young and wouldn't understand them as well as I would now. I'll have to watch the first 4 to see for a fact, but as for now I would say this new film is great and one of the best Jack Ryan films made to date.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
209,madelinehind,I enjoyed it,8,2 February 2014,"Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit is an entertaining modern thriller. It is beautifully shot, well paced and quite diverting.The script is a little linear when compared to Clancy's novels but this criticism is made redundant by the suspense, action and glamour the film provides.I wasn't sure about Chris Pine as Jack. My initial reservations were eased once I saw the direction that the script, and the reboot in general, were taking with the character.Kiera Knightley is fine as usual and its nice to see her in a contemporary action thriller at last.Kevin Costner's career resurgence continues. It is ironic that he was the first actor considered to play Jack when The Hunt For Red October was being filmed.The best performance is that of Kenneth Branagh as the villain. He also directs with panache, which is a welcome relief after his awful remake of Sleuth.Worth watching.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
210,paulwaidelich,Jack Ryan as a thinking man's action hero,8,11 May 2014,"For John Clancy purists and die hard Harrison Ford fans, there can be no movie to match your expectations. I've read the books, and seen every Harrison Ford movie, but I can't agree with the negative reviews. I liked Jack Ryan as a thinking man's action hero. Was it perfect? No. Will I watch the next in this series? You bet! The older Jack Ryan movies had a much more limited action budget. I thought there were too many fights, shootouts and car chases in this one. However, the younger Jack Ryan, played by Chris Pine, has physical courage to match his intellectual and moral courage. He figures out where the bad guys are heading, just like the Alec Baldwin/Harrison Ford Jack Ryans. The difference here is that once this Jack Ryan finds the bad guys, he beats them up.The second half of the movie does not equal the first half. The first half introduces and explores the characters. The last half is more like a James Bond movie. Boom. Bang. Crash. Shoot, bang, bang. The goofy grin on Chris Pine's face at the end is worth the wait.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
211,dragonmysterious,Political Thriller,7,3 February 2014,"From the trailer, and without knowledge of previous Jack Ryan films, Jack Ryan seems like an average spy action movie like The Bourne Trilogy or James Bond movies. However, its not. This movie gives us the origins of Jack Ryan. I came into the movie expecting an average spy action/thriller and it managed to surpass my expectations. Jack Ryan does not have many action scenes, as he uses more of his intellect than his fists. The exposition parts of the story are at times boring, but when Jack Ryan is doing his mission, it doesn't feel rushed, and it manages to constantly keep you in suspense. Even with not much action scenes, there were quite a few action scenes that come as a surprise. The director of the movie, who was also the villain, was pretty menacing with his Russian accent. Chris Pine was good, too. If you like spy movies, go into this movie not expecting much and this film will probably be better than expected, and it will constantly keep you off the edge of your seat.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
212,subbuparam,Looks like Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan is hiding in his shadow,1,30 May 2014,"I am trying to recover from the movie, Phew! I am wondering what just happened in the last 90 minutes. Kenneth Branagh has done an awful job as a director and also as Viktor. I just don't know what to write for 10 lines, the whole movie can be summed up by the word awful. Chris Pine as Jack Ryan? Seriously? After the likes of Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck, Chris Pine was chosen for the role? He does not even look like an analyst. i wonder what Keira Knightly's role is, the movie could easily have been made with no heroine. And Kevin Costner has made a fool of himself by accepting to act in this movie. And Kenneth Branagh looks cheesy to the core, just when you are getting over that cheesy image, he tries to act like a villain and fails miserably at it. Time is certainly precious and I should have saved my 90 minutes for something better.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
213,BrianLlywd,I really wanted to like this movie...,4,18 January 2014,"Having just read two Clancy tomes in the last month this release was timely and I was hoping that this pic would well serve the Clancy legacy. And I could see Chris Pines as a suitably young Jack Ryan. Clancy's stories are not draped in extravagance; they focus on plot and depiction of a reality that we civilians are not allowed to even dream about. But this was less a story than a special effects piece. When I watch a moving picture I want to see a story unfold, not be a part of it. And the number of close shots and action in lieu of plot and character made it difficult for me to watch as a bystander. Others, of course, will have other preferences. I must admit that I haven't liked Knightly much in anything in which I have seen her. Her presence always urges me to yell out, ""Get her a sandwich."" And I always wonder if her caterpillar eyebrows haven't sucked all her body fat out through her forehead. I found the action overly confusing so much that I couldn't really focus on the plot. And the time frame for the picture didn't seem to make sense and was a real flaw. He joined the marines and went to Afstan in 2003, met Cathy, recovered and was recruited and joined the CIA shortly thereafter. Then, all of a sudden it's 2010 (or so) and he is still a rookie, wet behind the ears. By then he should have about five years of service and not need so much coaching, nor be treated as such a rookie. I thought Branagh was good; little Larry is one of my favourites. I even liked him in ""How to Kill Your Neighbors Dog"" which almost no one else ever even saw. Overall, a very disappointing picture. It won't encourage me to see a sequel, nor to even pick up a Clancy book. Too bad. Jack Ryan is a great film character, but not in this mess.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
214,spikenard222,"Slick, but confusing and unconvincing",4,3 October 2015,"***Spoiler alert****For a spy thriller, this film tries to punch way above its cerebral weight, and ends up tangled and confused.The film starts off well, with a 9-11/Afghanistan back story of how Jack gets into espionage. He works undercover as a financial analyst, and follows a trail of financial clues to possible nefariousness in Moscow. In one of the better action scenes of the movie, his bodyguard is revealed as an assassin, but Jack prevails and suddenly realizes he has stumbled onto more than financial skulduggery. Up to this point, I enjoyed the film and was curious to see where it would go. Well, it ended up getting confused in its own details. Instead of a nuclear threat or something easily understood, somehow the audience is supposed to be convinced that the Russian government, acting through the company Jack is trying to audit, is going to somehow sink the dollar and cause the second Great Depression. This elicited but a groan. Russia has nowhere near the resources of any kind to sink the American dollar (this might have been more credible if the villain was Chinese). Moreover, the movie claims at one point that Russia has more oil reserves than we do, and will prevail in the chaos as the new world power. Either Hollywood is trying to pull a fast one, or the moguls truly don't know the extent of oil (and gas) reserves in North America. The whole threat is simply incredible, and the film begins to stumble.The sinking of the dollar is supposed to be tied to a terrorist attack, which leads to the worst part of the film. They can't stop the villain from selling assets (why not? just close the exchanges and put a public message out...), but they can thwart the terrorist attack. Which leads to standard chase scenes and last minute neutralizing of the attack (yawn). The worst scene was on the plane flying from Moscow to New York, where Jack, almost by his lonesome, does a whirlwind tour-de-force of instant analysis and connection-making to unravel where the attack will be and who will do it, aided by a lightning fast Internet that just pulls together the most coincidental information with blinding speed and a team of analysts who, with tons of spare time, somehow couldn't make all these connections themselves. Sherlock Holmes would blush.Chris Pine is OK as Jack Ryan. Nothing in particular stands out about his performance, other than he frequently appears to be imitating Matt Damon. Kevin Costner seems bored, like he was drugged through the whole film. Keira Knightley has a wonderful turn at the dinner table with the villain, but otherwise she comes off as whiny and petulant. Kenneth Branagh as the villain is quite good - seeing him stare with rage at the dinner table was memorable. He has an intensity and iciness that makes him the most memorable character of the movie.Lastly, you can just see that Jack's fiancée Cathy is going to get sucked into the plot, and you just groan at how it all goes down. Seriously, who flies to Moscow because they are worried their boyfriend might be cheating? And then she just gets 'recruited' by the CIA right there? Facepalm.The film has some good scenes, but overall it tries too hard to be too clever, and can't seem to get out of its own cerebral way.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
215,rsda,A good thriller,10,2 February 2014,"I expected very little from my admission ticket. And I must say that I was happily surprised to find an old fashioned action thriller with a good cast and lots of great moments. It is a throw-back to the 80's, that's for sure. Minimal CGI and a plot that holds together. it is reminiscent of films like DAY OF THE JACKEL, Russia HOUSE and the early Tom Clancy's. Don't want to give away plots twists or story points that demand a spoiler alert. The only minor quibble is that Chris Pine is a bit light weight as Jack Ryan. The rest of the cast is fine with Kevin Costner giving a performance that makes you recall why he has always been a fascinating actor. Do wish Kiera K. would get her teeth fixed. Pretty girl but oh those choppers are a shame.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
216,GodofGSXR1977,CIA Agent with a PhD Can't Hide A Movie Ticket,4,18 January 2014,"Very entertaining ride, but disappointing when put against the early Harrison Ford/Baldwin Jack Ryan films which took the subject matter more seriously and were not as ridiculously CSI-Miami-ish like this one is. Also they focused on his cunning and did not pretend he could transform in moments from geek analyst to James Bond in Hulk-like speed.Here are my gripes with this movie1) The infamous Hollywood cliché checklist: 9/11 Terror imagery? Check. Boogeymen Russians even though the cold war ended decades ago? Check. Ticking time bomb as opposed to a device that just blows up instantly via remote? Check. Name-dropping the latest internet social networks? Check. 2) We are meant to believe that a brilliant CIA analyst working on top secret national security projects is unable to hide something as benign as a movie ticket from a super secret meeting with another ""covert"" agent? 3) The CIA just runs around Moscow shooting off guns, speeding through streets, and clearing corpses from hotel rooms? Really? 4) A plot point is that one terrorist had someone take photos of a downtown city area for reconnaissance. As if there is not enough free, untrackable stock images available from google maps and other websites that show every square inch of every American city. Taking traceable photos of a building is pointless in the new internet age. 5) Keira Knightley's annoying face and whining. 6) The CIA leaving national security up to a CIA analyst who was activated by accident and his wife who didn't know he was working for the CIA. 7) A CIA analyst who only spent a few months in battle-training suddenly sneaking around like James Bond. 8) A pushing 60 Kevin Costner trying to be believable sneaking around like James Bond in skull caps. Also, Kevin Costner needed something else to do in this film other than just being Kevin Costner. He was a generic character with no impact on the stakes or overall climax. 9) We don't learn much about the main character besides the usual Hollywood cliché nonsense of him being a ""Patriotic, Heroic, Genius, Faithful husband"" American that has no flaws and of course was a Veteran who for some reason knows everything. In the Harrison Ford films at least we saw him at CIA headquarters and interacting with bureaucrats, etc. This film was like an episode of 24. 10) OK it's a movie, but the convenience of how many times these main characters happen to be in the right/wrong place at the right/wrong time is absolutely ridiculous. Not to mention the entire premise of the film relies on layers and layers of coincidences that all depend on Jack Ryan's life following an exact script in order to find out the terror plan, the perpetrators, and save the day. 11) The Russian villain suddenly realizes Jack Ryan is a history buff simply because Jack Ryan knows the name of a painting? Come on now. Where were the exchanges in Russian to show his linguistic skills? Just, OH, you know the name of this painting, therefore, audience, this guy is a historian. But overall an entertaining film, however generic and should have just been named something else, not related to Tom Clancy. Absurd but fun.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

However, the 1st two were filmed during the 90s and in the movies, which portray Jack Ryan later on as he moved up to deputy of CIA from being a Senator. The older movies portray Jack Ryan advanced in his CIA career long before 9/11 2001. In shadow Recruit, as a recruit, the movies portrays him in 2013 long after 9/11?

219,worshipthylouie,"""The best film of the first twenty days of 2014"".",6,19 January 2014,"It is still very early in the year of 2014, yet a number of films have already been released both on DVD and in theaters. So far, I have only viewed four, with three being nothing short of awful. Coincidentally enough, a film that I had doubt for due to a boring trailer managed to be far superior than the rest.I would groan every time I was sitting in a theater, excited to see what films would be coming out in the new year, only to see Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit time and time again. After viewing the film, I still hate the trailer. It spoiled a few scenes that could have been pleasant surprises. Such as the fight between Chris Pine and Nonso Anozie's characters, which ended up being quite fun regardless.The character of Jack Ryan has had quite the past in film history. This character created by Tom Clancy, has already been featured in films starring Ben Affleck, Harrison Ford, and Alec Baldwin. Chris Pine is the fourth, and holds his own in the role. It is likely that it will be the start of a new franchise. Jack Ryan is a very patriotic young man, who witnesses 911 on television during a day of school. Deeply impacted by the terrorist attack, he decides to drop out and join the marines. However, while serving in Afghanistan, a serious accident renders Ryan unable to walk on his own. Temporarily of course.Before his marine career abruptly ended, Ryan had sent papers revealing complex economic patterns to higher ups. It was ignored at the time, but did catch the attention of a CIA Agent by the name of Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner). Harper visits Ryan at rehab, and offers him a job. He must go back to college, get his PhD, and than he will be hired to monitor financial transactions on Wall Street for the CIA. Once recovered, Ryan completes his studies, and ten years later, is working his undercover job as a broker.He notices that the Russians are up to something sinister, and a man named Viktor Cheverin (Kenneth Branagh) is the source. Travelling to Russia with plans of auditing Viktor's special accounts, Ryan unexpectedly becomes a operational field agent when he is thrown right into the action.To make matters worse, his fiancée Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley), who is under the impression that Ryan is having an affair, shows up in Russia. You better believe that she will be thrust into danger in classic action movie romance fashion.The cast is quite wonderful. Good acting across the board, with director and cartoonish style evil villain, Kenneth Branagh, being the stand out. He is both cunning and charming to the ladies, yet unforgiving and merciless with the men. Kevin Costner was impressive, and I was sold on him being an actual CIA agent. His look, demeanor, and personality worked to perfection. Pines was believable as well, and had no weakness with being lead man material. It is a challenging task, and while his charisma is not sky high, I was never bored with his presence. Knightley being involved, and a key figure in these CIA missions did not look appealing. I thought the romance would be annoying, and slow everything down judging by the trailer. While it did lead to predictable scenarios, it was not half bad otherwise. They had chemistry, and were not a boring couple.Overall, it is a well made film, and it does manage to be the top dog released in the first twenty days of 2014. As a spy movie, it is quite decent and I would be willing to watch a sequel. With that said, it is far from perfect. The reason being is simply that you have seen the majority of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit before. The terrorist plot of wanting to put American in a great depression, and having them dependent on Russia is a great idea. The way the action sequences go, and the eventual climax is what has already been used. More than once. Countless times actually. The final fight, or big scenario to have the movie go out with a bang is so overused in action films that I face-palmed when I seen where it was going. In 2013, I seen both B movies and theater movies end in the exact same way. Even some superhero films have used this exact same ending, just done in a super powered way essentially.I get that a lot has already been done, and repetitiveness is unpreventable in the modern world of film. It is just that an ending like this is so lazy and uninspired as this point. You know exactly what, how and where it is going to happen, with no potential for surprise.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit will not send you home with claims that it was the best movie you have seen in years. It still remains far more intelligent than your usual popcorn action flick, and is the standout of January 2014. If you are in the mood for a formulaic spy film, and have no expectations of watching something spectacular, this will be worth the price of an admission ticket.Superpower Film Scale: 3/51: Villainous Waste2: Careless Bystander3: Hero unaware of powers4.

Political agenda not withstanding the clichés are flying thick and fast. Not since the Bond 'cold war' films have we seen such evil Russians and good wholesome Americans. Branagh gets to practice and pull off a 'reasonable to us non speakers' Russian accent and his most sinister face, Chris Pine gets to look wide-eyed and desperate ala Harrison Ford and Kevin Costner gets to be...well, Kevin Costner.They're able to bring a van decked out with state of the art computer, satellite and tracking equipment into mother Russia, plus an assortment of weaponry...break into a building containing even more state of the art security systems, circumvent them, rescue Ryan's girlfriend from Branagh and his dastardly designs for her and fly out unhindered (all last minute of course)...Once in the plane Ryan (Pine) looks like a rabid ferret as his eagle eyes and obviously razor sharp and pin pointedly accurate powers of perception and deduction have him solving nearly the whole plot in the air...fiancé Keira Knightly even though not an agent gets given one important deduction to make...""wait, pull back...""just to show us what a great match they are.

I'm really not very interested in whether Jack Ryan can audit a company and determine if it is financially undermining the US, and as such this film is incompelling. Good luck to those that choose to embark upon this voyage of dullness. My your dreams of financial espionage be better than the reality.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
223,RepublicofE,"Better than I expected, but that isn't saying much",7,7 February 2015,"Chris Pine does a competent but not stellar job as Jack Ryan. He certainly did better than Ben Affleck, and managed to keep the fact that he has played so many other prominent roles like Capt. Kirk recently from being a distraction. Overall not a bad casting decision. K Knightly also did a pretty decent job as Cathy Ryan.The first half of the film is actually pretty good all things considered, but after all the exposition is out of the way it degenerates into typical cheap action movie tropes pretty quick. The Jack Ryan series was always kind of like James Bond if it was serious and realistic, but the overused James Bond type clichés, such as the Russian Villain listening to opera or classical while being waited on by subordinates, can be pretty annoying. Even the terrible Some of All Fears film adaptation knew better than to have the obnoxiously overused cliché of showing the amount of time left on a bomb with a shot of the LED timer, but this PG-13 flick just couldn't resist.Contrary to popular belief among those who are not Tom Clancy fans, Clancy was NOT obsessed with Russia as political antagonists throughout his career. When the international political paradigm changed after the fall of the Iron Curtain, so did the nature of the Jack Ryan universe. Clancy never went on acting as if nothing had changed and the relationship between the US and Russia was the same as it had been during the Cold War.That's not to say that a good Jack Ryan movie still couldn't be made with Russians as the antagonists, but the plot is simply very weak. Something to do with an oil pipeline, which is somehow then connected to a financial terrorist stock market manipulation thingy while the pipeline story is all but forgotten, and then for some reason they also fell the need to throw in a part about a 9/11-type mass-casualty attack on Wallstreet. The motives of the perpetrators is unclear, just some vague stuff about ""avenging the pride of Mother Russia"" or something. It lacks the intricacy and realism for which Clancy was renowned.Clancy always narrated the Jack Ryan universe almost as if it was a futuristic sci-fi world. Everything always felt very raw and detailed. That isn't reflected in this film. Clancy would have known better than to have a professional killer try to kill a target (Ryan) by just spraying bullets everywhere like he was going on a school shooting spree and firing through doors and shower curtains without knowing if he had a chance of hitting like he had unlimited ammo. Things like that just really serve to zap you out of suspension of disbelief and remind you of the fact that Tom Clancy was dead when this was made and was not able to check their realism.And another thing: where is John Clark? One thing that could have upgraded this film from just another action blockbuster to a decent adaptation of the Jack Ryan universe would have been to have a good actor for John Clark and have good interaction between Ryan and Clark. Maybe even throw in Ding Chavez. One thing I always hated about previous Jack Ryan films was how the producers seemed to regard Clark as a relatively unimportant character and didn't give him much screen time, even in Clear and Present Danger when he should have been as important as Ryan. No one cares about this middle aged retired USN commander that is supposed to be Ryan's mentor or whatever, even if he was a character in the Jack Ryan books (I can't remember). If they were looking to start a new saga, as I am sure they were, they should have gotten a John Clark role right away. Because now that they didn't that just means they will probably end up having to shoe-horn in the character like they did in the Ford, Baldwin, and Afflec Jack Ryan films.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

The trailer made it look like a very typical action film that would possibly have a plot twist in it to keep us interested. Typical it was. Plot twist? Nope. I was bored the entire time.The plot is straight forward. A super intelligent former marine, war hero, who recovered from a wound he acquired saving his fellow marines, becomes an analyst for the CIA. He stumbles upon a terrorist plot straight out of the Cold War, and then gets thrown into the mix, becomes a field agent overnight, and saves America.At no point are you trying to figure out what is going on? Who is the villain? Who is behind the plot? What is the plot? The answers to these questions are all handed to us on a silver platter. I was left with other questions, addressing the gaping plot holes. Why did the King of Qarth try killing Jack Ryan? How did the bad guys already know he was after them? Why didn't they send more people when he didn't return? How did the FBI already know about a sleeper agent? Why wasn't the plot uncovered earlier if Chris Pine, Kiera Knightly and Kevin Costner can piece it together in 5 minutes on a plane? Why didn't the Sleeper agent stab Chris Pine when he had the chance...twice? I am glad I didn't have to pay to see this. Don't waste your money.

In this kind of movie, not being boring turns out to be a major quality. The action scenes feel like the direction could be better, though. My favourite part about this action movie might be the non-action scenes: Keira Knightley is as good as usual and makes a nice couple with Pine.

I personally don't rate Keira Knightly that highly, but she makes a fair attempt at an American accent and plays har part well. There were a couple of plot holes, but on the whole it was watchable and pretty enjoyable. As action thrillers go, it's a bit of harmless fun - don't let those low ratings put you off!

228,david-fisher26,Technically Interesting,6,31 July 2020,"As a physicist, I like this film for various extraneous reasons. For instance, the concept of stealing data via the mains supply recalls an old (circa 1980s) pre-bluetooth idea for linking household devices in which a high-frequency signal was superposed on the high-voltage supply. Secondly, the use of a 'Green' light-bulb as a torture device highlights the manner in which the general public has been hoodwinked. That is, a full cost/benefit analysis shows that the energy-saving arising from using such bulbs is negated by the extra cost resulting from the safe disposal of used bulbs. Of course, little attempt is made to do so safely, leading to pollution of the environment: so, not very Green after all! On the more general theme of 'pollution', all of those movies in which the heroes receive the personal thanks of the US President have been forever tainted by the present incumbent. Just imagine the relevant scene in this movie. Imagine the Tangerine Testicle probably taking the credit for their success.

Instead of the wounded full military/ drama stories we got with Red October and Patriot Games we end up with a standard Hollywood over the top action flick with analyst with no field experience Ryan and his clueless snooping girlfriend pulling enough moves on the streets of Moscow to put 007 to shame. The story had some good actors and cIearly had a decent budget yet as so often in the case of Hollywood they coudn't be bothered to hire a decent script writer.

I like Chris Pine as an actor and he has proved in the Star Trek reboots that he can be an action lead so I really didn't know how to feel. Walking out, I was entertained. It certainly was not the Bourne movie I was expecting, instead it was just an average action film. Jack Ryan has just enough to keep you watching, but not enough where you will want to watch it over and over. The acting, as I said, is fine. Chris Pine is OK here. He doesn't play it any different from any other role he has played in any other movie. Kenneth Branagh was great as the hammy Russian villain and he really carries most of the film. Everyone else is completely forgettable and their performances are OK. The film's action is directed greatly. The camera is not as shaky as it could be and the direction is perfect. The story is written fine but it really does not matter for a film like this. That being said, The film is not as intellectual as it could be and it is pretty by the numbers. If you want a great spy thriller that has great stakes and a great story, see The Bourne Ultimatum. Overall, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is perfectly average. I don't see it making my top 10 of the year, but I also don't see it making my worst of the year either. If you are really interested, rent it.

Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, which I saw this evening, has left me utterly blank. I could have just as well spent the evening dozing off on my Chaise longue comfortably tucked in listening to some nice music. This feature is so full of clichés recycled so many times that they become hardly worth mentioning. This theatrical adaptation of Clancy's novel has only shown us that Russia is very, very bad and naughty and that the US is righteous and very much hated by those very, very bad Russians. The latter are set on the path of destruction of the goodie good US and they deserve to fail as they eventually do. Simplified depictions of characters, black and white presentation of situations, car chases in Moscow depicted mostly by night adding to the overall ""badness"", are plentiful. Young Chris Pine, who plays Jack Ryan from the title of the movie, has shown us mostly that he has very bad complexion, blue eyes and very white and straight teeth and that he still, in his early thirties, bites his finger nails. The rest of his performance is hardly worth mentioning. His female companion, Keira Knightley, had faired slightly better, proving at least in one scene with Kenneth Branagh that she can act and actually do it quite well. Mr. Branagh is basically the only highlight of this movie. He plays his character so well that the audience cannot but hate the tragic fellow. Kevin Costner did a decent job of portraying a company man. If there is really nothing better to do, and you absolutely cannot think of any other way to kill two or so hours, go and see this movie.

242,quicksticks,"Pine, Branagh steal show in spy thriller",7,21 January 2014,"AN international spy thriller with a character-driven narrative and a plot relevant to our modern day are the crucial elements to give this well-balanced blockbuster the backbone for some decent viewing. In Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, the genesis of Tom Clancy's much adored creation makes its way to the big screen with Chris Pine taking control of yet another one of Hollywood's big characters. Kenneth Branagh — director of Thor and known for his performances in and direction of Shakespeare plays on both screen and stage — directs a stellar cast in the first screenplay not to be based on a Clancy novel. Jack Ryan is an undercover CIA agent working on Wall Street and it is his job to monitor irregularities in international money trading that could eventually lead to terrorist funding. When he notices an anomaly happening with a Russia-based company, he is sent on a mission to Moscow to uncover a potential threat against the United States economy. In the past, the character of Jack Ryan has been depicted by Hollywood old-timer Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin and an attempt to ""reboot"" the character in the 2002 Sum of all Fears with Ben Affleck, was neither a hit nor a miss. Hopefully, Mr Affleck can put in a star performance in 2016 when he dons the cape and cowl. After giving a commanding rendition as Captain Kirk in Star Trek into Darkness last year, Pine once again puts in a solid performance of carrying a well-educated Jack Ryan throughout the film. His character is damaged, untrusting, and fragile and puts his country before anything. One scene that really leaves audiences with discomfort is when Jack Ryan makes his first kill. It is brutal, effective and realistic — reminding me of the cold opener in Casino Royale. Kevin Costner gets a large chunk of screen time acting as Jack Ryan's mentor, while the beautiful Keira Knightley shines as the girlfriend — but is sometimes annoying with her fake American accent. And then we have Branagh, who plays the good, old-fashioned Russian tough guy antagonist. Putting it quite simply: Branagh is brilliant. This is not an action film. It is an espionage spy thriller with a few action scenes. So if you are expecting a film with more explosions than dialogue, you might be disappointed — it is directed by Kenneth Branagh after all. Just like Skyfall, the action scenes aren't anything new or breathtaking, but the tension and intensity built up on screen will keep audiences content. If the Dishfire reports are getting too real for you, head down to your local theatre and watch Jack Ryan take on the international villains instead.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
243,Carlosmave,A great film that manages to keep the action from beginning to end!,10,30 April 2014,"""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is an action film about Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst who works undercover in Wall Street, looking for suspicious financial transactions that could be related to terrorist activity. When he uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy, he becomes the target of many and is forced to spring into action to protect his country.This reboot of the Jack Ryan film series features an original story, not an adaptation of a particular Tom Clancy novel.The movie features a fresh and modern cast comprised of Chris Pine as the title character, Keira Knightley, Kevin Costner and Kenneth Branagh. Pine is perfect as Jack Ryan, being able to portray correctly both Jack Ryan, the office analyst and Jack Ryan, the patriotic agent. Costner is excellent as Thomas Harper, a mentor-like figure for Ryan. Knightley portrays Ryan's fiancée, Cathy Muller, in a great way, being able to step into danger when Ryan needs her help. And Branagh is fantastic as Viktor Cherevin, the Russian tycoon and mastermind of the conspiracy, being able to show the cold and cruel nature of the character. Branagh makes also a great job regarding the movie's direction.The movie is also full of great action scenes, occurring in locations that range from Moscow to New York.All this elements make ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" a solid action thriller film that manages to keep the action from beginning to end, a film that will definitely entertain you! Let's hope a sequel comes anytime soon!",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

All of the lead actors were exactly what was needed: Chris Pine, soft on the eyes, action hero, an average Joe in for more than he bargained for, but a soldier first and foremost; Keira Knightley, the pretty innocent who tags along, and then is up to the tasks at hand; Kevin Costner, the old mentor and Kenneth Branagh, who gets special mention for playing a Russian flawlessly. The plot was not complicated, easy to understand, but exciting even with its simplicity. And the plot was thoughtful in our contemporary times: full of technology and ideas of economic terrorism. The films was pleasant in its setting: lavish apartments and office buildings, high tech screens, exteriors in Moscow.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
245,natefishpa,I wanted to love it,6,29 June 2014,"Great cast. Well, mostly. I got this on pay per view at home and had no idea Kevin Costner and Keira Knightly were in this. I thought the supporting cast did extremely well. Unfortunately, Chris Pine wasn't given a ton to work with.The movie starts out in a 5 minute segment where he joined the marines and almost immediately gets into a helicopter accident. I wish they did a little more with this, give him some sort of special forces training or the like that would make his CIA moves a little more believable.10 years then working as a financial analyst while covertly working for the CIA. Doesn't really seem legit, but OK. Working as a compliance officer, he ends up going to Russia to investigate. Apparently, they don't have conference calls, email, etc. So they uncover a ploy to destroy the dollar. My first thought is, why doesn't the president halt trading? My second thought was when 9:00 happened, the bad guy needed to wait for the bombs to go off to cause issues. It still would have had the desired effect. So ultimately, I really wanted to like the movie. But the plot was really kind of mailed in with the writing. Here's how this went: 1) 5 minute action intro to give character credit 2) scene to show him recovering and meeting his girlfriend 3) weird recruitment into the CIA and do nothing for 10 years 4) fast forward 10 years. Financial nerd finds glitch. Goes to investigate in Russia. 5) The guy picking him up tries to kill him. This is the only person in the movie that Jack Ryan should not have trusted. 6) After almost getting killed, CIA orders him back to the room, where apparently, the CIA also recruit the best handymen in the world. Don't worry, you'll be safe in the room they just tried to kill you in. 7) Meet bad guy. Bait him to dinner to steal his s*** when he's at dinner. 8) Bring your fiancé, because it's always good to leave her with FSB when you try to break into his office. Oh, this was sort of lame, by the way. 9) Nail biter scene to escape office. Girlfriend is then abducted. No one saw this coming. 10) Bad guy threatens girlfriend with a light bulb. I kind of missed how this would be effective. 11) Jack Ryan stops a SUV with 4 heavily armed men with a crowbar. Saves girl, for some reason leaves the bad guy sans bullet in his head. 12) Jack Ryan then saves the day miraculously. Nothing original. God I wanted so much to like this.Great supporting cast, OK for Pine, good direction, poor writing. 6/10",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

249,TonFisch,Needed some polish on the story,6,22 April 2019,"Not quite sure where to put this film.
While the action, camera and sound design were definetly on the good side, the plot tries to get some depth going, but it just does not get it right enough to convince and to be remembered.The introduction works, despite beeing a bit cliché. Soldier gets injured, meets his great love and gets recruited by the CIA by a guy who has the ""seen it all""-look on his face.Then the money and time saving ""x years later"" headline happens and semi-broken man is now an agent doing business men things. Had this part gone for 5 minutes more, I would have quit watching. Was too much info nobody asked for, a repeating problem.As a business man he meats the villain. A plan is made to do agent things wich then gets a twist that works okay, hadnt it been teased so hard before, it would have worked better. There is a 6/10 tension at this point. The main problem beeing that every hurdle is jumped via ""CIA has an insider"". While copying data to a flash drive, there are things are explained wich nobody asked for.
The best persuit scene in the film follows, action is good, tension is not quite as high as I would have liked. Camera work is excellent here, not too much not to little movement.A typical main character scene follows. He is an analyst, sure, but how do pieces of information click for him put not for a team of CIA agents?For some reason, the film then closes with a ""double ending"".",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

252,orion-christy,"entertaining, but not memorable",6,18 January 2014,"With almost as many different actors portraying the title character as Bond or Batman, this newest Jack Ryan movie is actually not based off of a Tom Clancy novel. But 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' stars Chris Pine as the immortal CIA analyst. This time he is pitted against, you guessed it: the soviets, as they try to launch a plot to cripple the U.S. economy. But that's all I will tell you about the plot, read on to see how this latest iteration plays out on screen.We get to see new aspects of the agent's life and a rebooted origin story. Kevin Costner plays Thomas Harper, Ryan's recruiter and gives a good performance as a guy who's been leading a double life for quite some time, as you never really know if he's being entirely truthful.The story is one of double crosses and subterfuge; typical of an espionage tale.However, this execution contains a bit too much superfluous side information that can make the story difficult to follow. However, the action sequences are all excellently executed and lengthy enough to keep you distracted from the blotchy story.The story is very ""Clancy movie"" in that the resolution does have an operatic soundtrack at the enemy's ultimate realization of fate. This movie definitely rings true with its predecessors, but is not a game changer (like Bale in Batman or Craig in Bond.)At the close, I would like to thank Epic Theaters for their providing a very amiable theater in which to view this (and other) films and recommend that you go to one of their several local locations for your next cinematic experience.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Fully indulged in plot, I fell into illusion that I worked in CIA and wished maybe one day I can save the world. In someones opinions, the pace of the movie was a little bit quick, however, which made the film more thrilling. Ya, some parts were too fast and didn't clarify what happened, suck as the place where Jack saved Cathy Muller from Viktor Cherevin, which I only remembered Jack hitting the car window. Except that, the whole film made me speechless and I really admire the director, Kenneth Branagh, who acted Viktor. The way he deal with fighting and chasing scenes was flawless and precise, which was the reason why I recommended this film to someone who was excitement seeker.Well, as one of the Chris Pine's fans, it was very gleeful for me to see the film and his amazing performances also should be complimented.

254,mcmillan_peter,Not sure why this is being re-booted,6,12 January 2015,"I have found it hard to work out why Paramount have decided to re-boot this character - I liked Harrison Ford playing the role back in the 90s (so I guess that is half the reason for the 'newer' audiences), and thought his age and portrayal to be reasonably close to what Tom Clancy was writing about. The historical (literary) background was certainly more in line with that.Things have changed, but taking Jack Ryan 30 (roughly) years forward didn't work for me - he was a 1980s 1990s operative with little connection to what is happening now - he would (in reality) be enjoying a long overdue retirement. I liked Chris Pine as an early Kirk (heaven help us if they ever try to reprise James T in his prime though), but didn't seem right as a young Ryan. Costner did his usual workman like job. Keira Knightley - WHY??? The movie was awfully formulaic, shot 'nicely', had the usual plethora of ooh aah action, but sadly was disappointing. I give it a 6 as JUST watchable, but it is barely there...I enjoyed Kenneth Brannagh (as ever), found it odd he got a director credit - thought it shoulda woulda been better with him driving it...",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

It's horrible when compared to the other Jack Ryan movies starring the other actors but I don't think it's Pine's fault. The character development is extremely shallow when you consider this is supposed to be the origin story for a man who goes on to much greater things. The plot is also weak with a bad guy who seems to pose little threat other than dirty looks with a scheme involving banking to tank the US dollar. This is all to go down with a coordinated terror strike on US soil by a sleeper cell that never seems to fully wake up. That story seems to have been an after-thought.

258,nab_saleh,Too stereotypical to be liked!,6,10 June 2014,"Face it I have never read Tom Clancy and this is a review from a non-US viewer which although means that I do not really care much about the American patriotism but at the same time it doesn't mean that I have any problem with its full throttle display. However, one has to be honest you see this is not the Cold War era anymore and even if the recent invasion of Crimea by Russia is imagined to have brought back the animosity of that era then it is certainly overrated!That said, Shadow Recruit is laden with stereotypes where characters are carved out as simply black and white i.e. where the bad guys (Russians in this case) are intense but dumb, patriotic but also perverted. As for the good guys, they are intelligent beyond comprehension...so much so that their superiors seem dumb-founded in their presence. Give and take these were the same clichés which led to the widespread panning of movies like Die Hard 5 and Red Dawn ...and in that regard Shadow Recruit should be treated no differently. Its truly a shame really that with such a talented cast and a reputable director in Kenneth Branagh (whom I had become a fan of when I saw 'Thor'), the movie is predictable from the word go and has certainly no thrill!And although a comparison with 'The Hunt for the Red October' might seem unfair since it stars a more aged Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin), but despite the pressures of Cold War back then John McTiernan made it into a splendid movie which was miles ahead of its time!Lastly I have to spare Chris Pine in my thumbs down for this movie; who certainly seems the most genuine and has a very likable screen presence much similar to that of a young Tom Cruise.

Jack Ryan is about 63 years old now (were he actually real!). He was in his early 30's when he fortuitously saved HRH Prince Charles, Princess Di, and baby William from a terrorist attack. By this time, he has served two terms in the White House; his son is about 30 years old and doing the kind of crazy nonsense that this movie has his father doing. So if you absolutely HAVE to play with Jack Ryan, why not play with Ryan, Jr.? The new Star Trek has an excuse for completely changing history: it's science fiction, you can change history, and have Chris Pine play a brand-new James Tiberius Kirk (which he does an admirable job of).The action-spy-thriller genre doesn't lend itself so well to science fiction time warps, so don't try.

Regarding this film, I was expecting a satisfactory action thriller, assuming an A-list production, given the star alone, whom I've seen in other movies and have liked.I have a vague recollection that perhaps this character, Jack Ryan, is based on a modern Ian Fleming-type bestseller writer of government spook novels, and I was expecting a realistic gritty modern tough-guy scenario. I still do not know, or care, if there are such novels.I was riveted by the London School of Economics on 9-11 at the beginning, and the backstory that built up to his recruitment by Kevin Costner to be a super-spook for the government.Then the movie blew the whole mystique of my expectations -- Jack Ryan is such a twerpy little wussy that he has a sissy meltdown over 'water-boarding,' about which we, the audience, are not to condone under any circumstance, because it is torture and does not work anyway (both factually wrong), and nice guys don't do it.This is so ignorant, so far from reality, that it told me everything I needed to know about the movie, and left it immediately. Usually the writers of the stories know more about the world of their plot than the viewers. This proved total writer ignorance of the basics of the genre's real-world rules of engagement -- believing instead some gossipy lies from morality-mad mainstream media from which I was trying to escape -- by watching a movie!This meant there was nothing left at all for me, and I knew enough at the beginning of the movie to stop wasting my time.

His Russian driver thinks a great place to assassinate Jack would be in his hotel room just after he has checked in leaving a trail of witnesses.The CIA in Moscow has the resources to completely remodel Jacks trashed hotel room including broken plumbing within hours without anyone noticing.There is absolutely no chemistry between jack and Natalie Portman (eye surgeon yeah sure)and Kevin Costner seems to have Marlon Brandos marbles in his mouth.

I was so disappointed that I have to run home and watch The Hunt for Red October, The Patriot Game and The Clear and Present Danger all in a roll in two days. I love Jack Ryan, I love the character and all the books which I own and read them at least twice. I have one question for the writers of Hollywood, why every spy movie now has to involve car chase? And thanks to Edward Snowden, now we know the CIA is really hacking everybody this days. But does it always have to do it by inserting a jump drive into the enemy's computer? All the fancy technology, login password and stuff are making me dizzy. According CIA's own field guide book, the best spooks are teachers, librarian, and news reporters which reminds me of the Jack Ryan's naval historian teaching background. Yet Chris Pine's Ryan is a bike jumping, car racing, Bourne fighting hotrod. And in the book, Jack Ryan is a full blood and soul character. He has moral, and often shows logic and intelligence. During the whole time watching the movie, I was thinking about one word, ""suicide."" The only reason my beloved Jack Ryan is not dead is because he is the main character of the movie. As for the rest of the characters of the movie, if you are a good mathematician, another perfect kind of spook, you can literally eliminate them all including the evil Russian speaking director Kenneth. I am pretty sure, if the Emperor Putin wants an oil war with Uncle Sam, he doesn't need some secretive Russian shell company to sell off some dollars. Also it will take more than a few bombs and the crash of the stock market to send the United States of America back to the Great Depression. For Mr, Koepe the writer, please stop cooking up this kind of crap to scare some grade school kids. And also please no more car chasing in spy movie.

It'd be best to point directly to my big complaints, but I'd have to speak about specific plot elements and that would limit this review's utility.Suffice it to say that there are a couple of sadly outdated notions that are key to the underlying story. No doubt that was to be expected since Tom Clancy hasn't been writing Jack Ryan novels for some time now. But I seem to recall there being other instances where people took similarly burdened novels and updated them quite successfully for the screen. In this movie, near the end when they're trying to prevent a catastrophic event from occurring, I was actually thinking I'd feel much better if they'd just let it happen.Now is this reaction going to be limited to people of my particular political persuasion only? I sincerely hope not. Anyone paying attention to the financial news over the last decade should feel ill at ease at the basic premise here. But obviously a lot of people out of Hollywood were unable to see how offensively misguided this movie would seem to a lot of us.The acting and directing were adequate, but the plot itself torpedoed the entire project to my mind, and it really speaks badly of the producers and even the actors that they weren't able to see that and nix this project before it got off the ground. You get the feeling someone had sunk a certain amount into acquiring the rights and were determined to recover their investment come hell or high water.

And I'm not trying to be smart here, this is an important fact for everything that will follow. If they tried to simply assassinate him it would compromise their plot (Also for the aftermath if they succeeded, right?). If they knew he was a spy than everything that followed is unrealistic. If it is explained by ""a spy knows a spy"" and we are playing some spy games here than I seriously don't get the movie. They could have done so much better. A highly disappointing movie...

Jack Ryan has always been sort of a dull character in my book. Harrison Ford played him that way...Alex Baldwin had the best take on him, Ben Affleck was the same humdrum and here Chris Pine is likable tries hard but is not used well at all. His little comic comments he has done in other movies would have done well here if used right. Costner (this is the first of 3 very mediocre movies for him) puts in only a half effort, Knightley is hardly needed. (Frankly if I was Pine I'd be upset that my costars put in such a hum drum effort in one of my first solo movies) Branagh obviously put his effort into his Russian accent and not his directing duties. He should choose one job or the other. Its hard to spoil this movie here because there are no surprises, no plot points you haven't seen a dozen times before, no new characters, no new backdrops...its leftovers. When I went back and looked at the other movies that were written by David Koepp, I completely understood why this movie wasn't very good. None of his work is, except maybe Jurassic Park...but them he didn't really write that did he? Michael Chrichton did. So its a good movie to have on why you do something else, maybe the kids will like it okay. But this movie was moved from a Christmas release to a January release, that screams that the studio had no faith when they saw the finished product. Quite frankly they should make another Bourne movie if they want to do this type of flick. So I don't think the franchise is reborn...again...",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

The beginning showed a slow-moving movie, not slow to the point of boring, but not action packed.The acting in the movie was very well done, of all the individuals cast I went in with expectations of good performances, except for Kiera Knightley. I don't know why, but I just couldn't see her pulling off a serious role, as I had always thought of her acting as decent, but not great, and most of the time when she is a movie I am very cognizant that it her acting, and I don't get lost in the character. I must admit, she proved me wrong, and in this movie, I was able to believe she was the character. Chris Pine and Kevin Costner were also very very good in their roles. I may be biased, as I absolutely love Chris Pine, but I do think he did a great job in this movie.The cinematography was excellent, and honestly there was one part of the movie where I just went ""WOW!"" because it looked so cool.Overall, I do think this is an excellent movie, just not necessarily as fast-paced as people would expect.

It does include some of the key Jack Ryan characteristics; Former Marine 2nd Lt, Helicopter crash that ends his military career, Wall Street whiz, Cathy Ryan, etc. But, Chris Pine's Jack Ryan is not the Jack Ryan of the novels. Jack Ryan of Tom Clancy's story is an honorable, moral person, who keeps his cool under stressful situations (even if he sneaks a smoke under stress). He demonstrates many good leadership qualities. Not a novice spook, running from one crisis to another. Bottom line, Hollywood doesn't get it.

There is nothing shadowy about this movie, it plays out straightforward with the most mundane screenplay you have witnessed in ages. All the stereotypes involving a special agent fighting a foreign country are diligently followed - they didn't want to leave a single cliché behind. Though this movie has very poor acting overall, even a solid performance could not have saved anything - this movie is beyond salvage. Chris Pine does his job with sincerity but like I said it goes to waste. And Keira Knightley is not pleasant on your eyes when seen on the huge IMAX screens, especially her awful teeth make you wonder if the director ever for a second thought about the audience.

You keep watching because you know there is going to be the standard grand chase scene somewhere in the movie and you are hoping there might be something original there. There is no suspense or surprise. Chris Pine is not that good an actor and Keira Knightley does little other than look pretty.

280,CoRE-eu,"Another generic ''action'', ''spy'' movie.",6,8 May 2014,"This movie looked promising, I heard the books were good, so I had high hopes for the movie. However that seemed to be unjust, there are things that happen in this movie that'll make you think if it will redeem itself, so you keep watching it to find out, but it doesn't happen. It even gets worse when Jack says: we're not talking about 10 or 15.000 people more like 100.000. Then you might expect a massive explosion, at least bigger then depicted in this movie, but no, the car flies (and it does if you see where the explosion takes place compared to the distance the car went in the water) it blows up a couple hundreds of meters away from the shore. Not even harming our super hero. I do realise it's an action movie, but some things just seem odd to me, why would a terrorist drive in a fake police car through official police cars and not just go around wall street to be sure he goes unspotted in the tunnel? And then every police guy arrive under the tunnel and they are not there anymore in the next clip, oh dear god, how could anyone, in the police force, let this happen. It's time for an action movie that is realistic instead of focusing on the viewer and making a profit. Can't wait till I see: the Raid 2, to be honest.And what about the predictable ''the girlfriend shows up in Moscow'' which we've seen before. It's masked under the idea that she wants to know if she can trust her guy. You've been together for 10 years for crying out loud. No one in their right mind would go across the world to see if someone is trustworthy, especially if you've known each other for the past 10 years. If you do however the relationship must be so ****ed up it's better to leave each other in the first place.And then the highly secured office, OK I was a bit surprised to see the guard being a part of their little scheme when the 2 faces showed up on the security screen. But then it goes downhill again, the alarm goes off, but yet the ''head'' of security has to go to the office instead of the 100 security guards they have there?Summary: A movie that tries to be smart but isn't at all. It was entertaining at moments and that's what movies are for, so I will still give it a 6.0 for the entertainment, but for a big budget movie like this a 6.0 is really a 1.0!",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
281,joeymaley,Enjoyable Spy Thriller with dabs of action,8,15 May 2014,"Time for another episode of 'Joey Reviews Films And Things He Just Watched And Stuff'. (I am thinking of a better name but that is all i have at the moment.Today i will be talking about the 2014 action/ spy thriller Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. IMDb blurb - 'Jack Ryan, as a young covert CIA analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack.'Having seen the other Jack Ryan instalments (Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger and Sum of All Fears) i was at first somewhat apprehensive in watching this as i do love the films and books of which the came from. I was, however, put at ease when i heard that this will be a reboot of sorts (well it does star Chris Captain Kirk Pine and that is what he does now) and that the story was an original and not one of the books by the great Tom Clancy. So i went in with fresh eyes. Boy was i shocked by how much this film entertained me. It is a very well directed piece of work by the fantastic Kenneth Branagh, who also stars as the main villain. Branagh has always, in my opinion, been an outstanding director, be that in the mesmorising Hamlet (1996) or the fantasy epic Thor (2011). However, Branagh shows, once again, that he has that rare skill that many try yet few can master. Starring and directing.The film does not start slow, neither does it throw you into action for the hell of it. It finds this perfect speed and at no points deviates from that pace. It is, at it's heart, a geo-political thriller with elements of action. I find it important to state this as if it was the other way around you would end up with a film like A Good Day To Die Hard, which lets be fair, left us all wanting it to be something it is not. Shadow Recruit did not talk down to it's audience, neither does it go over the top. This is not a Michael Bay film, so the only explosions and gun fire you see is for the story and not for an army of teenage boys who need that or the attention span fails. In all, Shadow Recruit is a very well thought out film with wonderful acting by Pine as our lead, Keira Knightley as his girlfriend and Kevin Costner as the veteran CIA handler. The Joey-type Oscar for best actor does, however, go to Branagh who relishes being the bad guy without becoming the stereotypical James Bond villain. If you want a good thriller with just the right amount of action, this is by far the film for you. Out of 10 i would give this an 8.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

After the helicopter they were in gets shot to sh#t, he heroically saves two fellow officers and in the process, sustains damages to his spine, landing him in hospital with a 90min window of ever walking again. He has the hots for the med student(played by Keira Knightly - who wouldn't have the hots for her,) who's helping him walk again. They can't date..doctor/patient relationship, but they do end up married (i think?!) Anyways, he is approached by the CIA who offer him an undercover position, which they tout as a desk job..the condition of the post is that he should complete his doctorate. So the desk job he lands is that of an auditor/analyst. On a routine trip to Moscow to audit a clients books, he quickly learns that it's not your usual desk job (aka #FinallyTheActionBegins) when his client-provided chauffeur tries to kill him as soon as he enters his apartment. A fight ensues which results in a lovely bathroom being reduces to a bullet-hole filled, ceramic tile & glass shard, water park.

Kevin Costner gives a good performance making his character believable. Overall I enjoyed it, if you take it for what it is and not compare to the Harrison Ford Movies of the same Character it stands up well and a good action/spy movie.Things I missed: No reference to Admiral Greer who in (future) movies was supposed to be the main reason Ryan joined the CIA.My rating of 7 is due to the fact I enjoyed it, and hope you do too.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

I have never actually been a fan of Keira Knightley, so I usually critic her acting more than I should. But this time I was right. Her acting in this movie was just horrible. She and Chris Pine had no movie chemistry at all and I think some other actress should have been picked for this part. I planed to comment more on performances of other actors,but I decided not to.

You have a line of charismatic and first-class Hollywood actors and, given Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, a successful franchise which provides a lot of story and background. In short - all the ingredients for a successful reboot are there. Given his appearance in latest Star Trek, Chris Pine also proved himself as suitable candidate to do so. 
Unfortunately the creators messed the whole thing up by overloading the story: Within the first minutes Jack Ryan watches the WTC fall, participates in war on terror in Afghanistan, get insures, learns how to walk again, meets his future wife and get recruited by the CIA. To much? - hey, wait for the main plot and the other characters. Kevin Costner (introduced as recruiter of Jack Ryan) reappears again as main contact and a sniper (!) on a mission in Russia. Keira Knightleys character is rather schizophrenic as she turns from jealous girlfriend into an undercover agent and then into the understanding spouse. The main villain's (a Russian oligarch - thank for trying, Kenneth) motivation is the one of a dying true patriot wanting to leave a legacy to his family. That does not stop him from getting distracted by preferably married women and wasteful dinners. Anyway, the legacy part becomes particular disturbing as one learns that his only son lives the life of a sleeper on US soil since he was nine and is now destined to execute a suicide mission on his father's behalf. 
Next, I sense creative disagreement whether his is supposed to be a spy movie, a character study or an action movie. Maybe one should have briefed the director and cutter on that. In its current state it is unclear which scenes actually contribute to the plot. The relevance of the action sequences are trapped somewhere between 24 and Transformers.

295,splitting-65344,The story is really Tom Clancy,7,23 November 2020,"A reasonable action movie about Jack Ryan.
In recent weeks I have seen the 2 seasons about this CIA agent and they clearly have more time to explain the story in more detail and better. The first is set in part of the Middle East and the second part in South America, Venezuela.Quite different from this film, which mainly takes place in Moscow and in which a different actor plays the role of Ryan. To be honest I liked the characters in the series better, John Krasinski (Jack Ryan), Wendell Pierce (James Greer) and Michael Kelly (Mike November) I really liked their roles and they came across very convincing.
Not that Chris Pine doesn't look good as Jack Ryan, but it is a matter of getting used to. It is a pity that they did not work with the same actors for the main characters, the films do not differ that much in time.
As far as this film is concerned, the action is especially blood-curdling later in the film, the set is beautiful and the story is really Tom Clancy.

Russia could never hurt the US economy - the scale is simply too different, 2. the Russian government is in the pocket of the owners of the US and that tightly knit maffia would never even think about something like that for 0,2 seconds.

297,fademan77,Exciting thriller that doesn't quite make it,5,19 January 2014,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I was genuinely excited. An avid reader of Tom Clancy, I couldn't wait to see the reboot of the Ryan franchise on the big screen, and was truly hoping that Chris Pine would be the actor that could reboot the series on the big screen.However, after watching the film, I couldn't help but feel that I had seen it all before.The film is in three distinct parts - the first to set the scene for Jack Ryan as a young college student, the second is Jack as a secret agent, and the third a dramatic confrontation in New York.Addressing each part individually, it was made apparent that the writers wanted to try and keep the Jack Ryan story somewhat intact. In Hunt for Red October, it is mentioned that he had a helicopter accident training to be a marine. In the film, he was deployed and fighting in Afghanistan and has a helicopter accident. The initial scenes with Cathy (played by Keira Knightley) was done quite well, but the way the characters interacted throughout the remainder of the film was, in my opinion, forced. I felt that Keira didn't quite pull off the suspecting girlfriend routine, which didn't help with a script that never explained why she didn't want to set a date to marry her fiancé (which played a significant part in the film in the form of an engagement ring).The second act would have fit somewhat nicely in a Mission Impossible film. Viktor Cherevin, played with conviction by Kenneth Branagh is the 'evil businessman' and Jack had to uncover the plot. The main sequence, although suspenseful and with high production values, was a rinse-and- repeat of dozen's of films. Stealing a key-card, hacking a computer, and distracting the 'bad guy' has been done before. It would have been refreshing for the writers to come up with something more original.The third act was a let down, in more ways than one. The film deserved a dramatic finish, and the disappointing CGI and small-scale chase felt like the producers ran out of money to complete the film to the scale that it deserved, after the quite high-tech and glamorous middle act.Overall, don't expect this to be of the caliber of Red October, nor MI4, but a blend of both and a few rungs lower in quality.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Pine would have grown into the role but Knightly would probably have had trouble fitting the stereotypical ""mother raising kids at home"" that Clancy clumsily wrote. Branaugh did a good job directing, especially the final 5 minutes. Took the easy way out with his own character.

From his time as a young Marine officer in Afghanistan, to his recovery at Walter Reed, to how he meet his future wife Cathy, and to his recruitment to the CIA.As an undercover agent on Wall Street, he discovered some secret Russian bank account and reported it to his CIA handler Kevin Costner. The rest of story takes off for there.I really enjoyed this movie and thought it was really well done. After seeing the movie I feel like the critics are being overcritical and I even wonder if they saw the same movie as I did.There's a lot of fear or complain that they made Jack Ryan too much like Bond or Bourne. I can assure you that's not the case, this Ryan is clearly out of his element on the field.There's also complain about too much romance in the movie or that it's force or unrealistic, which I don't agree with at all. It'd make sense for a wounded warrior like Jack Ryan to fall in love with Med Student Cathy while he was recovering at Walter Reed.The acting overall was solid and I like the way all the main characters work off of each other.I think Tom Clancy would approve of Ryan's origin story because it was clear the writers did their research. Like in the movie, Ryan mentioned that he was a Baltimore Raven fan, that make sense because in the books story arch Jack Ryan grew up in Baltimore.So in closing, this is a solid start to a new movie series, my only complain is that I wanted to see more of his origins story. Like his time as a Marine and how much CIA training he actually went through on the farm.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
300,ebosch-2,Already done by many,2,16 February 2014,"I am not the most discriminating of action film viewers, avid reader of Clancy and his designated batters and thought Chris Pine did a wonderful job on the Star Trek films. That said, this film was a load of rubbish....one of the few times that I seriously considered walking out mid-film. The reasons: 1. Acting was wooden across the board and the selection of Keira Knightly as Dr. Cathy Ryan was abysmally bad;2. Plot (contrary to some of the views I read) was non-existent and farcical. Unlike a good Clancy novel, no basis in reality;3. There is one scene that is particularly ridiculous. All I will ask an intelligent viewer, do you ever think a Russian oligarch worth billions would seriously consider going out to dinner with a compliance officer. I would seriously not bother going to see this film or even bother it renting it. In short, even if someone gave me free tickets with dinner included, I would now pass on the ""opportunity.""",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
301,zhaoyufeng925,"Decent action thriller, but lack of style. Recruit, but not exactly shadowed",7,16 January 2014,"When they first announced this, I thought it would be big, like a start of a new big franchise. Then it stayed quite for a long time, and then it was scheduled to land in January. Something like the producers have lost their confidence and ambition.So how is the movie as a whole? Well, largely depend on what their goal is. If they just want to make some well-executed small commercial action flick that brings in some 50-plus millions box-office, they have done a good job and the movie has been nicely tailored for this. But if they are looking at a big and memorable franchise, then this is way off. The movie has very standard execution, from editing to camera-shooting to music all fit in very well. But all together, there is a lack of style here, a lack of something that differentiates itself from the other movies in the same genre. The most disappointing thing about this movie is that it can be anything, the main character can be anybody, and it all doesn't matter.Let's say the problem of lack of style originates from the script, there is something specific I want to say about the plot. In the post-dark-knight period a lot of movies are trying to take on this sort of darker tone, which is actually something that I personally appreciate. However, the movie should always better be similar to what it is publicized to be, otherwise a big disappointment will be there due to wrong expectation, despite how the movie actually is. There is a big word ""Shadow"" in the title and the poster looks so serious. But in the movie I didn't see Jack Ryan really went through any major conflicts and challenges. Actually almost everything went smoothly for this smart, talented standard action hero. I would suggest a simple trick they could have used, which is actually nothing new, to at least make the word ""Shadow"" fit in: make Costner's role the real villain. But Spoilers Here that didn't happen.So how is Jack Ryan in this movie? Can be summarized as Ethan Hunt without the stunts. Frankly speaking I haven't read any Jack Ryan novels so I have no idea what the character is like in the book. But as an analyst who does 90% of his work behind the desk, how did he get to fight so well, and ride motorcycle in such a stylish way. The story will be more convincing to me if I get to see a nerd who sort of struggles his every move in his very first field work, but somehow what I get is some trained agent who is almost as invincible as Jason Bourne.Overall speaking, I would say the movie is OK but the director and producers didn't manage to bring out its potentials. It can be a good fun but I'm not expecting a second installment to happen.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit fails to keep up with the timeline that is set forth by the other four films and in doing so, may upset some of its viewers. Also, this film is not based on any of the books which may upset some. Nonetheless, Chris Pine turns in a surprisingly entertaining turn as Jack Ryan. The plot is also smart and at times complex, making for an entertaining and enjoyable geo-political thriller.

Some stuff this movie talk about is real, like companies controlling people and countries, but show in a manipulative perspective; the USA spy network is a good thing, look we got 1 Asian, 1 black, 1 white working on it... we are all mix, we are free.. the old speech of lies, bullshit to make people believe the American way of life is the best way of all the planet, and everybody must follow this...

304,justserag,A Weak Forgettable Thriller,6,31 May 2014,"Spoiler Alert A blunt disappointing American thriller, falsely advertised as an action.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit fails miserably to benefit from its charismatic cast and promising director.It has its bright sides but it's far from satisfying for a Jack Ryan film.Tom Clancy must be cursing in his grave. After the great job Kenneth Branagh did on Thor, we expected him to helm the reboot of this troubled franchise to give something equal to a Bourne or Bond film.What we got instead is a poorly written thriller that sounds like something Schwarzenegger or JCVD would have done in their downfall eras. Branagh (the director) surprisingly directed a film that lacks the proper pacing and a suitable middle act.The script written by Adam Cozad , and rewritten by the great David Koepp is messy, non ambitious, weakly paced and full of plot holes (Why should they hire the newly recruited Ryan to face such a dangerous criminal as Cherevin, can't they just get an experienced agent ?).The music by Patrick Doyle is weak, unrecognizable within the film and by no means creative. The cast is the most prominent element in this feature.Chris Pine though an inferior comparison to Ford, Baldwin and Affleck but it wasn't his fault.The character wasn't strongly written to give him material of which he can build a three-dimensional role, and it's given very little time to develop.But Pine does great with what he has, and he made a good job portraying a character on the line between frailty and the ability,in addition to being a very charismatic hero.Cathy Muller didn't show anything new of Keira Knightley, and it made us feel that our beloved Elizabeth Swan was a second grade actress.It just wasn't a role that she could benefit from but it benefited from her due to her talent and star status.Kevin Costner was the real star of the film as the veteran agent Thomas Harper, he stole the scenes and gave us a great mentor to Ryan.I will be looking forward to see him play the role again in the John Clark film Without Remorse (and hopefully Tom Hardy will play Clark).Branagh (the actor) played the villain Victor Cherevin so amazingly well that it makes it impossible to believe that this incredibly talented person is the faulty director of this picture.With a trend of portraying foreign characters, he played this Russian mastermind perfectly and very much convincingly, and his death scene is the most remarkable scene in the film.The supporting cast hasn't done much to speak of except for Nonso Anozie who excelled as the Ugandian henchman/assassin Embee Deng, and gave us a good fight scene with Ryan. The action is surprisingly few in this film.Aside from the Ryan and Embee fight scene and the climax in the end, the film is more of a crime-thriller.Many parts are boring and elongated needlessly.Plot holes and errors are scattering all around the running time.And it's overall forgettable once you're done with watching it. Rating 6/10 just for the sake of its cast.I hope Branagh makes a better job with the upcoming Cinderella.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

If so, then the story should take place in the early 80's, not around 2001 and then progress to present times. If this Jack Ryan is Jack Ryan, Jr, then it can make more sense. Also, no one noticed or heard the flight and shooting inside the super big hotel room? And a supposedly super smart person like Kenneth Branagh did not realise his wallet was picked then returned? The wallet must be at least an inch thick. Taking a walk for 15 minutes gave Jack all the time he needed to run up to Kenneth's office and copy the files? And yes, Keira Knightly's teeth was obnoxious. She should get it fixed. Kevin Costner was actually not to bad, but the same type of character has been played a million times. I especially hate it when one is riding a motorcycle and talk on the cell phone at the same time. If this movie is about The New Spy Game, then it's acceptable.

The cast and writing was a lot stronger than I was expecting, but - and this might sound kind of dark - just once, I'd love to see a movie like this where the main antagonist(s) actually win (something like what **SPOILERS** Arlington Road **SPOILERS** managed to pull off). If the writers had put a bit more effort into fleshing out the characters as opposed to relying on tried-and-true tropes, this could have easily had a much better critical reception, as well as a better chance at revitalizing the Jack Ryan franchise.All-in-all, I can see why Paramount pushed this to an early January theatrical release; it wasn't strong enough to stand against any other competitors at the box office. And, even though Chris Pine makes a much more likable Jack Ryan than Ben Affleck did, unless Paramount has the conviction to really handle the franchise right, I doubt we'll get to see him as Ryan again any time soon.Oh, and they really should have spent more time coming up with a better title; Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit sounds like a crappy video game that I wouldn't bother to play, even for free",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

When she isn't talking too much due to her curiously huge and obnoxiously meddling role as Chris Pine's love interest, she stares about with her mouth agape. Come to think of it, I don't recall ever seeing her lips together in ANY film. Just an awful casting choice. Pine's charisma made the action and cloak and dagger themes enjoyable while still predictable.

The character portrayed by Kiera Knightly was an atypical ignorant 'empowered' female role that was completely out of touch with the plot and just did not 'fit'. This was especially so when she 'turned' up' unannounced in an extremely unrealistic situation. It appears to me that her character should have been left behind and picked up again later in the movie. The people who decided to expand the role of Jack Ryan's girlfriend such that she became pretty much the focus of the movie, instead of the views/morals and actions between Jack Ryan and 'the bad guy', made a huge mistake - both in plot and in casting. Note to Producers - you do not need to 'force' a strong female role into an action movie to give it credibility - in fact to do that comes across as incoherent and pretentious - and ruins the movie.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

316,lopatg,Not worth the money for a Jack Ryan reboot,1,14 September 2014,"********Spoiler************I just watched this movie and I am grateful that we did not pay to see it. Well, maybe some small part in my taxes as we borrowed it from the city library. I'm definitely happy I did not pay the full theater price. When I heard how this movie came about, theoretically trying to reboot the Jack Ryan franchise, by changing a script by basically changing the main character's name to Jack Ryan, I knew this was going to be a looser. It just seems totally dishonest to bill this as a Jack Ryan story when it has almost none of the elements from the Jack Ryan stories. If they had just billed is as new espionage thriller not related to Jack Ryan, I would have supported it a lot more. I even may have influenced a few friends to not see it until they heard of the actual reviews. So, I believe I helped keep the opening weekend box office down a tiny, teeny, percentage. Change the name of the character to any name you want, this is not one of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books. The people who did this film missed it completely. Jack Ryan is more than a secret agent, more than just spending a few preview minutes on screen giving this guy the same history as the Jack Ryan from the Tom Clancy novels. Just like no one would ever become the instant captain of a starship from Star Trek, no person would become mister super secret agent just because he was a natural. This is not Jack Ryan from the novels. This is the same problem from when they tried to reboot the franchise years ago with Ben Affleck. Just keeps the movies closer to what Tom Clancy wrote.

319,Brinda_B,Refreshing and Intelligent,8,23 January 2014,"I went to a movie on a whim. It was Tuesday, cheap ticket day at my local theatre, and I was by the theatre with nothing planned for the afternoon. It was the only movie playing at the time I walked in, so I thought, why not? I am glad that I did. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit was, in a word, refreshing. Shadow Recruit is a more intelligent take on the classic spy movie. Chris Pine plays Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst turned reluctant field agent as he, along with his unit commanded by Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner), tries to thwart a Russian terror plot.Shadow Recruit has action, humour, character, emotion, and a good plot (which is sometimes sorely lacking in action movies). Overall, however, it is designed as a blockbuster movie. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end with a typical climax thrown in there. This makes certain aspects of it quite predictable, but these days it isn't likely you'll come across a movie (an action movie especially) that completely throws you off your predictions.My favourite part of this movie was all that was left unsaid, under the surface of what was going on. It let you feel the characters, know their motivations, and often deduce for yourself the importance of a simple action, or a camera shot. It really went back to the roots of storytelling where everything is there for a reason--whether that be to expose or develop the character, or to carry the plot along--and often times it was there for more than one reason. Because of this, the characters really stood out. You don't have to be told that Jack Ryan is an honest sort of guy, everything he does speaks of it. You don't have to be told that Cathy Muller is compassionate, she shows you that she is. Lately it seems that movie-makers believe that viewers need everything shown, told, and repeated in order for it to be noticed. It's a bit of narcissism on their part, I think. They don't want any part of their brilliant masterpiece to be overlooked, and so they tell you too much and don't leave it for you to pick up on. Shadow Recruit was a refreshing change from this.I liked this movie especially for digging deeper into what is shown, but it was a good movie just to sit down to with a bag of popcorn. Digging isn't necessary for the film to make sense or to be enjoyable.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

329,arif-bangshal,"Don't expect too much, just enjoy the popcorn!",7,22 August 2014,"When I sat down to watch the Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit, the 2nd reboot of Clancy's Jack Ryan franchise, I didn't have any great expectations. It was the origin story of the character Jack Ryan. Wasn't really sure if Chris Pine could pull off the character of Jack Ryan previously played by actors like Ben Affleck, Harrison Ford and John Travolta. But after watching this film, in my opinion, he is clearly the second best actor portraying the character, behind only the great FORD! If I am being honest, Pine's acting was one of the very few things which made the film enjoyable. Let's start with the trailer. The trailer shows another typical (for these types of movies) terrorist plot of attack with worldwide impact. The theme is - trust no one. Everyone is out there trying to betray you. Cathy (Keira Knightley) is a Russian spy. Everyone has secrets and they are trying to kill you! Nothing original, nothing interesting. If I hadn't downloaded the movie before watching the trailer, I am not sure I'd have downloaded and subsequently, watched it. The movie was better than the trailer. And that says a lot.The story was absurd! Really absurd, even in the Hollywood standard. Pre-Cold war story butchered to fit into today's screen. (SPOILER Alert!) We are supposed to believe that, Russia is trying to destroy the world's economy (in the process destroying their own economy too, flushing TWO TRILLION DOLLARS down the drain!) to cause the 2nd great depression! And somehow, every single intelligence agency missed that, while Russians planned for it, prepared for it and very nearly executed it! Were they trying to sell us that all secret agencies in the world are made of stupid and incompetent people like the script writers themselves! And to top it all, this great catastrophe was averted almost SINGLE HANDEDLY by the super human (nearly) analyst (who worked 10 years behind a desk after sustaining a heavy spinal damage) turned agent Jack Ryan! He did all the fighting, car chasing, foot chasing, breaking into the bad guy's office, stealing secrets, saving the girl, saving the day and all other super heroic stuff all by himself! Come on! I know he is the title character but at least share some bread crumbs with somebody to make it believable! The action sequences were terrible (worst in the franchise). If the action sequences in an action movie are bad, what is left there to watch? Kenneth Branagh the director of Thor (2011) directed and acted in this movie. If it was not written in the trailer I'd have never guessed it. While Thor had a great story line, great character development, great action sequences, great sounds, the absence of all these elements which made Thor so great from this movie made it hard to believe that Branagh has 5 Academy and 5 Golden Globe nominations. As actor Chris Pine did his best with this crappy script to make us believe that we are watching a good film and for the most part he succeeds. Knightley was good too. Costner wasn't a very good mentor (maybe the script didn't allow him to be). Overall not a bad movie. Although it lacks the breath taking thrills, good and original script of the Ford's movies, if you don't sit to watch this movie with too much expectation then you won't be disappointed. Just ignore the small! details like believable story, good actions - then it is not a bad watch. Just sit with a bag of popcorn and you won't notice when the bag has been emptied! Not the worst way to spend a Friday night, is it?",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
330,nlumina2,Worst actress ever Keira Knightley,3,3 August 2014,Weak plot with hard to believe turn of events which don't make any sense. Keira (with her squirrel face) is at her worst. You don't know if she is making faces or smiling. Smirking is NOT ACTING. The movie is a copycat a wannabe Tom Cruise movie. All actions in the movie are unrealistic. A man with a gun can't even shut a person in a hotel room. Fires 15 shoots in furniture. Waste of time. Kevin Costner is still a decent actor. But other than that the same scenario: women are stupid and man are macho. The movie is slow and do not engage you. Complete lack of emotion this is at it's best just an average movie that you will forget by tomorrow.,Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
331,angelcake171,Awesome,8,17 January 2014,I saw the free screening for this movie and it was a pretty good movie. Even though it is more of an action movie but it was also funny. I'm a huge fan of Chris Pine. i truly believe that the movie should have been in the public eye more because I didn't know anything about this movie until last week. I just hope with little air time on TV that it make people want to see it. Since I got to see this movie in IMAX you can see a whole lot of things different from the regular movie screens that others really don't notice. For some odd reason Chris Pine reminds of Ben Afflack; either way he is still a hottie and extra salty. All in all this was a pretty good movie that I have successfully shared my experience with my friends and family.,Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

What a great way to spend a couple of hours with action packed drama & intrigue! I'm not a professional reviewer, film critic, or wanna be director/actor.... I just wanted to be entertained the old fashioned way. I didn't know what the plot was about, who directed it or how long i would be in the cinema. Chris Pine is gripping, Kenneth Branagh is superb as is Kevin Costner. Keira Knightley is intelligent & sexy. Great action plot involving CIA, WallStreet finances & Russian politics, obligatory car chases, menacing henchmen & gunfire and super sleuth spy technology. It's got it all to be entertaining. Reminds me of the action in Bruce Willis Die Hard movies but even better.

I watched the reviews and I thoroughly enjoyed the film to the point i would watch it again. To the reviewer who found the part, that Jack had spinal surgery but after slamming his motorcycle into the side of a van, walked away and chased still after the villain, obviously didn't watch the film properly , as he had his surgery 10 year previous and was constantly regaining his strength over this time, so would very likely be able to do this.

How does Jack go from being a CIA analyst to being fully operative, able to drive at high rates of speed in a city he's never been in within a matter of a day, and why was the bomb at the end of the movie set for 5 minutes? 30 plus years of planning for a downfall of the US in 2014, with a well plotted attacked on NYC by some Russian with stage 3 psorasis and a VODKA problem or whatever and the bomb was set to 5 minutes.

Why? -Because Chris Pine and Kiera Knightley are so dreamy (although her fashion sense at a dinner scene was questionable) -Because the ""breaching a security system"" scene is always a favorite -The dramatic irony of the audience knowing the bad guy is being tricked and smiling to themselves when the plan works as if they did anything is quite possibly the BEST feeling ever. -Because I got a mini history and economy lesson and i didn't even know it (subliminal messages, friends) -Did I mention Chris Pine was dreamy?For the reasons stated above, this movie is excellent and I hope i didn't spoil anything by saying that CIA movies are the best and that IT IS worth your time.

What a horrible departure from the original suspense filled classic drama action packed script of Jack Ryan previous movies. The acting is sub-par and it almost seems like a bad mash up of Jack Ryan meets Jason Bourne having a identity crisis on a bad Mission Impossible date. The story line lacks depth and forget about nothing to over done and exaggerated for the characters is off limits with this crappy film.

What idiot woman would do that for a man when she has her own career. Have the script writers dated in the last 2 decades To hell why even put it in the script. This is an action movie not a rom-com.

The idea of reinventing the character just bothers me. The new Jack Ryan comes along a couple of decades later and the love of his life is his eye surgeon doctor. Jack works for the CIA and on Wall Street. Why didn't they just create the new character as Jack Ryan's son. They could have told the same story with Jack Ryan II. Then we could look forward to more Jack Ryan offspring in years to come instead of the same character popping up decades later. What will they do next: Will they reinvent Jack Bauer. Geez.

If you are from western civilization, you will love the end of this film, if you are Russian or any other nations suffered from US invasions or its policy you will be definitely upset.Anyway, even with some rude sort of American propaganda to show the Russians as ""bad guys"" it is possible to see that the main Russian hero is the real patriot of Russia who is the private person and does not represent the point of view of Russian government and act on his own will.Terrorism is unacceptable even for all the terrible things what US did all over the world, but as for financial strike which was described in this movie, I hope it will happen soon or later.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

I feel that Movies these days are built upon the theory of ""The Bigger The Better"" what I mean by that is; if the world's end is not at risk Producers, Writers, and Director's feel that the movie will not be a hit.Christopher Pine's monumental performance in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit takes that preconceived notion of how the world's population views Movies and throws it in the trash and clicks delete. Shadow Recruit was not only at times witty, but the female lead role did not have to be a drug addict, prostitute, or in anyway ""A Damsel in Distress"" as she helped Christopher Pine the most. This movie was riveting while also gave true and factual knowledge of the Shadow Society which I myself (Amir Hisham Ouazzani) am an ex-member of to this day.I give Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit 10/10 stars for those reasons mentioned and for the sake of not giving spoilers many more reasons not mentioned.

347,kelcycole,It is actually pretty good. Don't let others ruin it for you.,8,21 March 2015,"I just watched this movie and I fail to understand why so many people are dissing it. It was fine for an action thriller. Everything does not have to blow up like a nuclear explosion. Chris Pine was great as a young Jack Ryan (even if they didn't adhere to the original canon). I would watch him as Jack Ryan in another movie. Personally, I have always thought that Alec Baldwin diminished the Hunt for Red October as he was totally wooden in it and while I will watch the movie I try to ignore Alec's performance and focus on everyone else. As for Kiera Knightly's American accent? It was fine. Better than fine actually. Consider that Sean Connery never makes an attempt at any accent and certainly didn't in the Hunt for Red October. Most American actors are horrid when they try for foreign accents. I could not believe people were going on about her teeth. I didn't fix my teeth until I was 50. Let's not start going on about all the famous American actors/actresses who have less than perfect teeth. I will watch this again.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

Chris Pine delivered an amazing performance as Jack Ryan - giving us all the back story to how he became the agent that was made famous.I agree that there were a few inconsistencies with the story that don't mesh up to the movies that follow it, but overall, it was a stellar performance - he gave LIFE back to a character that didn't really have a chance of continuing. He should be noted for that and applauded.I think there are several scenes that Chris Pine did an amazing job in - most notably his recovery scenes, where he absolutely is believable as a man struggling to come back into his physical, emotional and mental prime. No spoilers - just watch the movie and enjoy the fact that Chris had the courage to tackle a character with such aplomb and dignity. I truly hope he does another one!!",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

351,augustincoppey,I think many reviewers were sleeping during the movie,7,15 April 2016,"This review focuses on the negative critics, which I find to be quite unrepresentative of the movie.Most negative reviews focus on the act that the marketing tag line ""trust no one"" was woefully unrepresentative of the actual plot. I have serious objections about that. There is a major betrayal early in the movie, at a point that no one expects, which sets the stage for confusion and doubts in the hero's mind through the rest of the film. This effect only works if you are concentrating on the main actor, suspending disbelief about watching a movie and instead letting yourself slip into the hero's mind: inexperienced in field Ops and betrayed on his first mission. All the negative reviews below are because the viewer was eating popcorn instead of falling into character. In truth ""trust"" in not a major plot line, but it's not absent either, as the review imply. It's just texture to build up the tension.This brings me to my second comment: I enjoyed this movie's plot, (despite, yes, many shortcomings regarding the details), because the story line was very representative of Tom Clancy's writing style, with multiple plots going on in parallel but on different time frames. This worked very well for me in the books, building up tension with very little relief until the last pages. The movie here produces the same effect with the same technique. I can accept that it makes the story somewhat convoluted at times, and it may possibly lose many viewers with short attention spans, causing some negative reviews. But if your attention can keep up, then you realize why the main character can ""trust no one"" - he is as confused by the plot as the viewer (because inexperienced and fallible), trying to keep up with the multiple objectives on multiple time frames. I found this to be an excellent technique to build suspense in an intelligent way, with very little special effects or dumb actions scenes (there are good action scenes, but no one is an invincible here - just plain human).In short, you will find this movie boring if you find iron man or superman to be great entertainment. If you've enjoyed reading the books, you may find this to be a better story than the previous Jack Ryan movies.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit

355,andrewsharp-48308,"Nothing to see here, folks",3,13 August 2018,"OK, maybe that's a little harsh. Chris Pine for one is a good, sympatico lead, but he's struggling against a rip tide in this formulaic reboot of an American Cold War wet dream.
A chill went down my spine when Scots character actor (and a very good one, too), David Hayman, appeared as a Russian apparatchik. I know, a Scots accent is virtually indistinguishable from a Russian (I mean, it's all the same that side of the Atlantic, isn't it?), but it's not a good sign when the cliche of USA goodies vs Rest of the World baddies appears again.
I thought we'd got past that naive world view with the Dubya era. Evidently not.
The plot? Well, it has been done before, and better. 
Kenneth Branagh does his sinister thing, but it's one dimensional. If you want to see what he can really do with a script, have a look at his turn as Heydrich in ""Conspiracy"". Now, that is a very good rendition of evil as normality.
So, what do we have here? Fodder to watch when you're chugging a six pack and a takeaway. If the dog starts howling outside, put the pic on hold and sort it out. Or don't put it on hold; I guarantee you'll pick up the story without difficulty when you get back.",Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit
