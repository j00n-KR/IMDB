0,Leofwine_draca,Gung-ho adventure with added heart,7,9 November 2016,"I've always had a penchant for films set in the jungle, and TEARS OF THE SUN makes excellent use of some sweaty jungle locales in its story of US soldiers battling Nigerian rebels. It's a story of human drama masquerading as a war movie, and action lovers will be disappointed as all of the gun battles are saved for the (admittedly spectacular) last half hour. Before then we get a film based on real-life events that runs the gamut of emotions, from courage to anger, fear to bravery and everything in between.It's nothing new, but benefits from some superb acting from the assembled cast members: Bruce Willis, as silent and stern as ever, acts with just his eyes for the most part and gets the viewer totally on-side; Monica Bellucci is utterly beautiful and tough as the doctor working against the odds, and the rest of the American soldiers are also brilliant – including Cole Hauser as a tough cookie and Tom Skerritt as a grizzled veteran. Well-shot, well directed, and with plenty of story and emotion to keep it going, at first glance this might be typical gung-ho adventure stuff but it's much more. It's got heart and conscience and it never disappoints despite the lengthy running time. A solid thriller.",Tears of the Sun
1,SnoopyStyle,Functional brutal drama with action,7,14 September 2014,"Nigeria is in a state of chaos after a coupe. Navy SEAL Lieutenant A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) and his team are sent to rescue Doctors Without Borders physician Dr. Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci), a priest and two nuns. Kendricks refuses to leave the helpless villagers behind. The priest and the nuns stay behind, while Waters leads everybody on a walk to Cameroon. The Catholic mission is destroyed and everybody is massacred. Waters kidnaps Kendricks away on the helicopters while leaving the refugees behind. However when they fly over the destroyed village, Waters decides to return to help lead the villagers to safety. The group is relentlessly pursued by the rebel army.It's a functional drama that devolves into a blow-em-up action movie. It works as the former but not really the latter. The exodus is nightmarish and the massacres are brutal. I like the savagery because it fits the situation. Kendricks is way too naive. Bellucci is doing too much melodramatic acting. It would be much better to have a younger actress so her naivety wouldn't be so glaring. Willis is able to pull it back by giving the movie its reserved intensity. The Hawaiian jungle looks great and is a good substitute. The final battle is too big and too bombastic. Not only is it too unrealistic but it also takes away the grittiness of the rest of the movie. It's a lot of overdramatized unreasonable action. Dropping a few bombs on a mass of troops wouldn't kill them all, and it's highly doubtful that this 3rd world border has an insurmountable fence.",Tears of the Sun
2,claudio_carvalho,When Tough Soldiers Become Human Beings,8,28 August 2004,"In Nigeria, the rebel troops killed the elected president and his family, and are performing an `ethnical cleaning', killing the other tribes. The platoon leaded by Lt. A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) is assigned in a mission in the jungle of Nigeria for rescuing the American Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (Monica Bellucci). Once in the location, Dr. Lena only agrees to leave the place if the team rescue also the other refugees lodged in the mission. In principle and with the intention of accomplishing his orders, Commander Waters agrees with the terms of Dr. Lena, but when the helicopters arrive, he leaves the Nigerians alone in the jungle. However, after seeing the massacre made by the rebel troops in the mission where he was, he returns and decides to lead the Nigerians to the safety of Cameroon. This film is a surprisingly good dramatic action movie. I do not believe that an experienced and tough soldier would jeopardize his mission, like Lt. Waters does in this story. However, Bruce Willis is perfect as a tough soldier, who gets evolved and shows compassion with the situation of the Nigerians. The citation from Edmund Burke in the end of the story is also very beautiful: 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing'. Although having some flaws in the story, I found this movie a good entertainment, with a great message in the end. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `Lágrimas do Sol' (`Tears of the Sun')",Tears of the Sun
3,ccthemovieman-1,'War Movie' With A Noble Message,8,22 August 2006,"The is a solid ""war"" movie with U.S. Navy Seals, led by Bruce Willis, rescuing an American doctor and 70 of her patients from war-torn Nigeria. This is violent and bloody n parts but definitely not another ""Blackhawk Down"" with overdone violence (although I liked Blackhawk Down).This is beautifully-filmed, artistic in spots. I imagine this would look super on HD with a big plasma TV. The sound is excellent, too. Critics didn't like this movie. I suspect one big reason is that they are used to seeing films in which Christians are shown as sympathetic victims of persecution. Critics also don't like to see the right thing being exalted.Willis is perfect for this role as the strong, stone-faced leader. Monica Bellucci could have been a little more likable as the doctor. The story gets a little too melodramatic at the end, but it's tolerable. This is not a family film by any means, because of the violence, perhaps 20 f- words and a dozen abuses of the Lord's name in vain. Still, an interesting movie with a different slant, and at least has a noble message.",Tears of the Sun
4,rmax304823,Relatively Successful Action Movie.,7,15 October 2010,"This isn't Rambo or anything like it. Bruce Willis and his half-dozen or so men are inserted into Nigeria during an uprising with the object of saving Doctor Monica Belluci, whose life is in danger at the hospital. The Nigerian soldiers are genuine miscreants. They chop the heads off priests, rape women and cut off their breasts, slaughter the helpless patients.Belluci insists that seventy refugees be taken with her to safety. Willis agrees to get them out of immediate danger but the choppers they reach in a jungle clearing can only carry out Doctor Belluci and a handful of Nigerians. Belluci refuses to leave the rest. Willis decides to dispatch the old and disabled in the helicopters and lead the desperate remainder out on foot. He does so, more or less, after copious amounts of lead are exchanged.The movie deserves a pat on the back for its even-handedness. The Africans get almost equal screen time and importance. True, most of them are tokens (and I could have done without the cliché of the native royalty) but there is only room for so many principal performers in any movie. Action movies involving mixed groups are tricky to handle because allegiances tend to be so polarized. Let a white man rescue a black man and it ""perpetuates the stereotype"" of the black man being unable to take care of himself. And if a black man rescues a white man, it's the old ""Uncle Tom"" stereotype, evoking the humble old Darkie of ""Gone With The Wind."" Or -- if a man shoots a woman -- it's the expression of unconscious desires in a male supremacist. And if a woman shoots a man it's the latent paranoia of a patriarchal society. Sometimes you just can't win.This film handles the problem with some delicacy. And there are battles in the bush, to be sure, and they're filmed in the fashionable high-contrast manner that turns all shadows inky black and all highlights a blinding white. The editing is out of MTV.But between these exciting but depressing incidents some of the Africans are individualized and we get to know them fairly well. Monica Belluci is pretty in a Jean-Moreau kind of way but her white doctor is just another character. The angry, pouting Belluci and the sweaty, whiskery, virile, bald Willis never once kiss. They never even come close. Nor does Willis catch her bathing nude in a jungle pool. There are no jungle pools. There are no drooping pythons either, nor creeping scorpions. No wild beasts at all. Isn't it refreshing? There is one shot of a horned chameleon but he's cute, not dangerous, and he's not lingered over. There are many casualties among the good guys, and just about all of the bad guys are wiped out due to the seasonable interposition of a gracious pair of Navy fighter-bombers. Ka-BOOM. The cavalry arrives just in time.So, yeah, it has its quotient of action. The bullets and RPGs zip and bang all over the place. But there's also an element of thoughtfulness that's hard to find in some gore fest featuring Sylvester or Arnold or Dolph.",Tears of the Sun
5,Quinoa1984,"Looking at Willis's face, you know how this film will go",6,15 March 2003,"It is indeed a difference when there's a war movie with as much compassion as the need for death, when a lot of war movies go for showing the basic realities of war.  In this case, Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), goes for showing a reality of war that is not seen much by the eye of the camera in the news, a story that unfolds as something of a cliche, but never-the-less Tears of the Sun is effective in its suspensful-manipulative sensibilities. Bruce Willis, who plays the lead lietnenat leading a group of Nigerians to safety from horrible rebel troops, is as stone-faced as can be, and sometimes it gets annoying, but it works for such a role as this. 
Perhaps one of the qurims I had with this film also has to do with the attitudes towards god- Willis says early on the picture ""God already left Africa"", which could be correct depending on the opinion of the viewer. Then by the end a Nigerian tells him after his grand victory ""God will never forget you"".  How does this one person know god will forget or not forget a leader of an elite troop of American killers?  Wouldn't faith in it dictate that someone like Willis would go to hell for his sins?  But that is heavily besides the point, since Tears of the Sun focuses on faith as a side issue- this is an action film, pure and simple, and when it gets to that in the battle footage it works best.

6,jotix100,Long night's trek into freedom,8,20 March 2003,"This is a very deceiving film. It appears to be an action thriller on the surface, but on second thought, this is a story of how a man can be a good human being by disobeying the command he was given to perform. Anthony Fuqua's latest film proves that he is an interesting director from the last offering he gave us.Mr Fuqua is working here away from the urban setting of the last film. He takes us to the African jungle; maybe he feels that working in such disparate places he finds that his message is basically the same if we compare the Bruce Willis character here with the Ethan Hawke one in the last film. Both are very decent men. Both go against the jobs they are given to perform and in doing so, they both redeem themselves in more ways than they intended.Bruce Willis plays the group's leader of the mission the group in his command is given to do. He's a laconic person; he has seen a lot during his years of wars. He is set to deceive the doctor he is sent to save into letting her believe he is going to help the people she is reluctant to leave behind. His decency gets the best of him; or maybe is his own conscience. He gets very involved in a situation that causes him the wrath of his commanding officer. Maybe is neither, but once he is involved there's no going back.
The last part of the film is an action drama but up to that point, it's a very moody piece of film making thanks to Mr. Fuqua's sure direction. We can rejoice Antoine Fuqua's career in films is just starting. He certainly has a lot still to show us.Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci are fine as the main characters caught in the worst nightmare of the civil war around them. The rest of the ensemble cast is very good.",Tears of the Sun
7,LeonLouisRicci,"""I can't look at these People as Packages anymore.""",8,26 June 2015,"Highly Emotional political Action Movie that could have been Made Yesterday with absolutely No Changes. The Fictional Story could be one in Tomorrow's Headlines if said Story was given the OK. There are many Atrocities of African Tribal Genocide currently Underway.The Captain states in a Pre-Mission Briefing...Their committing these brutal atrocities because someone goes to a different church (paraphrasing).This is an Admirable and Noble Picture that is Crafty and shot with a template of Hollywood Gloss but it Never Fails to keep its Message above the presentation of Jungle Warfare that is done with an Artistic Style but remains Gritty and Engaging.Yes, it's another Bruce Willis Saves the World Movie, one mission at a time, but the World Needs Saving. At the Low End of the Food Chain, these Africans are at the Mercy of Evil entities and are up Against the Onslaught with only Their Bibles and a Love for Their Families.The Film Pulls Few Punches and is a Rousing of the Heart. Much Suffering for the Mission to Save the Mission with a Female Doctor in charge that seems a bit Naive, but totally Dedicated to ""Her People"". Overall, a Good Cast and a Good Director Pull This Off as more than an Action/War Movie and deliver a Poignant, Profound Picture of Today's African plight and the Extreme and Evil leaders that Surface on a daily basis, ruling with No Opposition and Succeed by the Blood of Innocents and mind numbing Killings and Mutilations.

8,poolandrews,Didn't like it.,4,19 July 2007,"Tears of the Sun starts as special ops commander Lieutenant Waters (Bruce Willis) gets back from one mission in the civil war torn country of Nigeria & is instantly told he has to go back, the Nigerian presidential family have been executed & rebels are gaining control of the country. Waters & his team of men are ordered to fly in & rescue an American doctor named Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci), simple eh? Well Dr. Kendricks doesn't want to leave her patients behind to be slaughtered by rebels & insists they come, Waters agrees & as they hike through the jungle the American soldiers become emotionally involved & will give up their own lives to get these people to safety...Directed by Antoine Fuqua I was pretty disappointed with Tears of the Sun, I was hoping it was going to be a Bruce Willis action blockbuster but in the end it turned out to be a slow moving moralistic piece of crap. Tears of the Sun is available in a 142 minute director's cut & the original 121 minute theatrical version, I will be commenting on the theatrical cut. The script by Alex Lasker & Patrick Cirillo really piles on the sentimental crap, the scenes as Willis & his men are flying away but then suddenly changing his mind & going back to rescue the refugees is so cheesy it's untrue. Then there's the clichéd plot of having Willis & the Doctor hate each other at first but then 'gain' respect for each other as the film progresses, I was deeply unmoved. Then there's the fact that Tears of the Sun is a depressing two hours as it deals with a civil war, to be honest I watch a film to get away from this sort of crap, I want to have a good time, forget about real life & be entertained not feel even worse. I don't know whether Tears of the Sun portrays an accurate picture of the events in Nigeria & to honest I don't care, quite simply I don't care if Nigeria is in the middle of a civil war. My country has it's own problems but we don't go around murdering each other, if they can't live like civil human beings & still live in mud huts then that's up to them & what exactly do we owe these people? Most countries in the world have managed to accept the basic notion of living in a democracy, if these people want to kill themselves all I can say is leave them to it. Does that make me a w@nker? Does that make me a heartless son of a b*tch? Well if it does it probably makes most of the worlds population the same.Director Auqua does nothing to liven things up & the clichés that pile up are just embarrassing, the patriotic American heroes who can fight off an entire army of rebel soldiers who, incidentally, can't shoot straight for instance. The action scenes are poor, there are a few dull shoot outs that look exactly the same & nothing else. The character's are poor, the dialogue is weak & it of course takes the moralistic high ground which basically means it sides with the way the American Government thinks. A poor effort from all involved & it's even filmed in very dull washed out colours so even the jungle locations look dull & grey, isn't wood meant to be brown not black? Forget about any violence or proper action as this isn't that kind of film, limited to a few dull shoot outs & that's it.With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 this had mega money spent on it & to be honest I can't really see where it went, a lot probably went on paying Mr Willis though. Mostly shot in Hawaii the film actually looks rather dull. I like Bruce Willis as a Hollywood star & I think he's been in some cracking films & can actually act if he tries so his presence lifts what would otherwise be a fairly unwatchable film. Nobody else does anything worth mentioning.Tears of the Sun is a poor big budget action flick disguised as some moralistic nonsense, do the filmmakers really think a crap film like this will help the people of Nigeria? Why don't they just cut the middle man out, save everyone some time & just give the $70 million it cost to make Tears of the Sun to the Nigerian people themselves?",Tears of the Sun
9,Calicodreamin,Strong message of humanity,7,3 September 2021,"A well made war drama that puts the highlight on humanity.

10,Boba_Fett1138,Good realistically made war movie but what was with the story?,6,9 August 2005,"This movie creates a good realistic and powerful atmosphere but the story is just absolutely ridicules and highly unlikely. So, the realistic atmosphere of the movie is in deep contrast with the story which makes this movie nothing more than an average action/war movie.The movie can perhaps be best described as a mix between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Predator"" (without the Predator being in it, of course). The movie has a realistic atmosphere like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the action from ""Predator"". Also both the stories from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Predator"" show certain parallels with this movie. So, no terribly original this movie isn't but on top of that the movie also features some highly unlikely plot-lines that were just simply ridiculous at times. I'm not going to spoil it for you but when you see the movie you'll know what I mean.The movie features some nice action moments and some graphic moments. But yet the movie also has some nicely done emotional sequences, without ever going over-the-top with them.Having Bruce Willis staring in an action movie is never a bad thing and it is also always nice to see Tom Skerritt in a big production. The characters however never really become really interesting and of some characters you don't even get to know their names, simply because they all look too much alike, I am especially talking about all the Navy SEAL characters here.The music by Hans Zimmer and friends is perhaps a bit underrated and is worth listening to and is truly something that helps to add to the movie its atmosphere.All in all, if you like action movies this movie is still a perfectly watchable one for you. Its simple good entertainment and emotional at the right moments.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Tears of the Sun
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not Black Hawk Down, but not bad",7,2 December 2013,"A civil war has broken out in Nigeria, and as international forces determine what is going to be done about it, American citizens are evacuated. First from the embassy, and now others are to be transported out safely... Dr. Kendricks(Bellucci, a strong woman - she insists that they bring some of the wounded she has been attending to), and the nuns and priest who work alongside her in a Christian mission. The mission is put on the shoulders of Lieutenant Waters(Willis, putting his ""steely blue eyes look"" to great effect, clearly with a ton of emotion and consideration going on under the surface) and his Navy SEAL team. With guerrilla forces having numbers on their side, will they be able to get to safety in time?Casting, setting(you can practically smell the thick jungle), sound, editing(battle scenes are usually strictly from the perspective of the aforementioned specially trained soldiers, with us being no more certain of where everyone on the other side is, how many there are, etc.) - this is highly authentic and realistic, except for the climax. Of course, even before then, the Hollywood factor is rather obvious. Dialog and plot progression is very clichéd, with a running theme of US heroism - ah, if only they could police the world. Things are so black and white, it's no trouble telling friend and foe apart even deep in unfamiliar territory, and, thankfully, there exists no problem complex enough to require a solution that doesn't involve a trigger.Ignoring that, this is fairly enjoyable, even engaging. Though you won't ""buy it"", the ending is a pretty good culmination to the tension that gradually rises throughout. This is an hour and 47 minutes long sans credits, 1 hour and 55 minutes with them. You're never bored, and, while it can border on the pornographic, this does capture a lot of the ugliness and atrocities that occur when one group of people try to destroy another. The acting is great for all concerned, including one of the most credible children I've ever seen grace the screen.There is a lot of brutal, bloody, violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to big fans of the people who made this. 7/10",Tears of the Sun

When she won't leave without her patients, Walters is forced to abandon the planned helicopter rescue and trek a parade of walking wounded through the jungle to the border with Cameroon, pursued by rebel forces.This is a perfectly satisfactory action movie.

We didn't need a ludicrous script and millions of dollars in special effects to prove these points.  I seemed to be one of the few who thought Antoine Fuqua's direction was over the top in ""Training Day"", but I am certain most will agree with me on this movie.

14,Wuchakk,"Neither really good nor really bad, but worthwhile for a few reasons",5,13 March 2014,"""Tears of the Sun"" (2003) tells the story of a squadron of Navy Seals led by Bruce Willis who are on mission in Nigeria to remove a beautiful American doctor (Monica Belucci) from a Christian village before evil Islamic militants move in and annihilate 'em all. Belucci insists that ""her people"" go with them. Willis initially refuses but later has a change of heart. Since there are too many to remove via helicopter they have no choice but to lead 'em out on foot to the Cameroon border. Will they make it out alive? I remember seeing a scene or two while channel surfing a few years ago and it perked my interest. What I saw had an ultra-serious vibe and seemed to have depth as well. It looked like my cup of tea because I'm a huge fan of the original ""Apocalypse Now."" The icing on the cake is the presence of Monica Belucci, who's definitely one of the most beautiful women to ever grace God's Earth. Seriously, her face is incredible! Well, I've seen it twice now and, despite all the positive items it has going, I can't help but find it kinda disappointing. I've already listed the positives so allow me to cite what doesn't work: After seeing the film twice now I only remember two characters -- Willis and Belucci. Every other character is totally forgettable. This isn't the case at all with, say, ""Apocalypse Now"" wherein the viewer knew and remembered every single member of Capt. Willard's team after seeing the film once, not to mention the major peripheral characters. Another good example would be ""Last Of The Mohicans"" (1992), which has a similar theme (i.e. good people being chased through the forest by evil villains).The mistake of ""Tears of the Sun"" is that it jumps right into the thick of the jungle story without allowing the viewer to get to know anyone. As already noted, the theme is heavy and the vibe is fittingly serious, including the score, but because we aren't emotionally tied to the characters the picture comes across too heavy-handed and melodramatic.I should also add that the 2-hour film is fairly slow moving and that the big-action sequence doesn't take place until the finale. The problem with this ""exciting"" climax is that the viewer, once again, doesn't care what happens at this point because we don't really know the characters and therefore have little emotional attachment. I just got done watching the ending and I was quite bored -- lazily strumming my acoustic guitar, looking around the room, etc.Although the story takes place in Nigeria the picture was obviously shot in Hawaii. The difference in geography is enough that the film loses points for realism, but who can deny the beauty of Hawaii? So maybe it gains the points back.The Director's Cut merely adds the deleted scenes from the Special Edition DVD to the film. In other words, unless you absolutely love the film it's not necessary to buy the Director's Cut; just watch the deleted scenes. Speaking of the deleted scenes, there's one quietly potent scene where a black American talks with a black Nigerian. It has great dialogue and should have never been cut.BOTTOM LINE: ""Tears of the Sun"" has some attributes, including the ultra-serious vibe, cinematography, score and Monica Belucci. But this is far from a good film. At the same time, it's not bad. It's just okay. Check out ""Rambo"" (2008) if you want to see the same theme done in an effective manner.GRADE: C",Tears of the Sun
15,mm-39,No Black Hawk Down,6,4 April 2003,"Spoiler  This film lacks the realism of Black Hawk Down, but Black Hawk Down is about real events, and this is a Hollywood script.  I do not believe, Willis would ever be given Comand again after almost killing his chalk.  I give the movie credit for fighting the PC Moore crowd and showing the truth of the brutiality that exists in the third world.  Maybe, Willi's character defies his orders, because of past guilt form other missions. There is some syrupie, Hollywood, scenes with the locals, and the lead actres that makes me laugh.  This film trys to show another end of the Americian specturm, with out the Moore crowds  out dated they kill children, and the CIA is behind a dirty White House back stab conspiracy. America is dammed if they do , and dammed if they don't dated scripts get more boring, each and every year.

18,KineticSeoul,Worth a watch but just isn't all that memorable,7,18 April 2013,"This is basically a chase battle movie where the good guys and a group of civilians have to get from point A to point B while the bad guys are chasing them. When it comes down to it, it's a very simple premise but the certain amount of humanity is what drives this movie. This movie takes place in Africa where tribal warfare is going on and people are getting killed off because of what others believe in and because of ethnic cleansing. But when it all comes down to it, it's about economic power. And a group of Navy Seals lead by Lieutenant A.K. Waters(Bruce Willis) is put on a mission to go to a small village in Africa in order to bring back a priest and few doctors. But one of the doctors Waters meets makes him contemplate from just following orders or doing the right thing. And that doctor is Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks(Monica Bellucci) who probably inspired the makers of ""Metal Gear Solid 4"" video game for the character Naomi Hunter, well at least how she looks in the game. The characters aren't all that memorable either, because of they seem one dimensional or just not enough development going for a lot of them. But it didn't take away all that much from this movie watching experience. This movie brings out the brutality of tribal warfare and what evil men would go to for personal gain. It's not a memorable movie when it comes to the story but the humanity aspect of it leaves something to think about.7.3/'0",Tears of the Sun
19,Robert_duder,It's war...it'll make you feel war but not the characters in the same way,8,23 June 2008,"Tears of the Sun was near and dear to both the producer, director and star's heart. How politically correct or truthful this is to current or past situations in Africa I really don't know but I'm not sure that it matters because the message of the story is clear...this IS happening throughout the world. This film is not about one man, one woman, one platoon, one country, one dictator, this is about the actions happening to a group of people that could happen anywhere and about humanity standing up and doing something. All that being said I do wish that there was some more character development, that perhaps we got to know the characters more deeply along the lines of Saving Private Ryan. You get to know the soldiers and characters about as well if you were just among them trying to escape which maybe gives it a very real feel to the whole thing but as a viewer of a movie it doesn't give you the entertainment value. Still the latter action scenes in the film are astonishing and brutal and jaw dropping. The film builds to this climax that is so much more than just an average action flick. Throughout the film it's describing these atrocities and showing little tid bits of it and then you get the full on battle against it.I am a huge Bruce Willis fan. The man is box office gold and despite what some say he can act and he has an intensity and strength about him that is undeniable. He shows this in his performance as Lt. A.K. Waters, the leader of an elite group of Special Ops soldiers sent to extract a doctor from an impending war zone. His defiance and humanity saves lives. Willis is a conflicted character and does go through a fairly big change in the film from being dedicated to completing his mission to saving the lives of these refugees. You get the impression that after many previous unseen missions he reaches his breaking point and feels intent on saving some lives. He is really good although you just don't get a lot of character development for him. Monica Bellucci gets one of the more developed roles as American doctor Lena Fiore Kendricks. She is a bit abrasive and hard headed but a good character none the less and determined to save her people no matter what. Unfortunately I felt like one of the plot holes was the fact that she seemed to put more in risk than saving them with her obnoxious impulsive behavior. Sadly they tried to force a completely unnecessary and poorly developed romance between Willis and Bellucci which doesn't work AT ALL. Cole Hauser, Eamonn Walker, Nick Chinlund, Charles Ingram, Paul Francis, and Chad Smith are all terrific as Willis' team, all with their own unique nickname and talents but yet you only really get to know them by face because they don't get any real character development but it's still devastating to watch them fight. They all did a great job and I particularly enjoy Cole Hauser who I think needs a big break through role in the future. Tom Skerritt plays the role he played from Top Gun almost to a T. He's a great character actor and does the cameo role well.This is one of two films that director Antoine Fuqua really took a gritty and real angle too and was really trying to say something (the other being Training Day.) Tears of the Sun is exactly what the title suggests, it shows the brutality of war and so called ""ethnic cleansing."" There are sub plots that don't really pan out (the terribly misplaced romance for instance.) The film starts out a little slowly but definitely picks up but still will never really meet regular (action films standards.) The film is a bold political statement and that being said you will be entertained and maybe open your eyes too. As a Bruce Willis fan you won't be disappointed and if you love war films it is perhaps very under rated because it definitely makes it's point clear. 8/10",Tears of the Sun
20,dromasca,a bad film about a good cause,3,26 October 2007,"It is sometimes hard to understand how blockbuster stars like Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci pick such bad movies. Each of them has stared in major movies, each of them is capable of making a film succeed. And yet they chose to act in a movie like 'Tears of the Sun' which has no chance of success from start because of the very thin story and naive, almost propagandistic approach to the events described.Sure, it's a film made for a good cause. Ethnic cleansing happens in Nigeria following a coup, good and tough guy Willis is sent to rescue beautiful and humanitarian doctor Bellucci, and despite the non-engagement orders he receives for his superiors becomes involved, helping the victims of the conflict. Actually it is in the jungle fight and the atrocities scenes where one can find the more acceptable parts of the movie, the camera man does not lack some talent, but the story is so schematic and predictable that it looks like propaganda, and is so deprived of events that it would hardly cover a 50 minutes TV series. What we get is a long and exhausting trail not only of the heroes through their jungle, but also of the viewers towards the end of the movie. It's just a bad film about a good cause.",Tears of the Sun

Since I love this kind of genre and Bruce Willis, I checked out this film anyway. I had a good time. The acting performances were good and the music is mesmerizing.This is about a group of soldiers in Nigeria whose mission is to save a doctor and to beat the rebels.The acting is very good. Bruce of course still kicks butt. Monica Bellucci is pretty good as well.Overall, this is a good war movie with a strong moral. There are some flaws here but that's to be expected. I rate this film 8/10.",Tears of the Sun
22,CuriosityKilledShawn,Difficult to figure out but pays off emotionally,6,26 February 2005,"Here is a worthless fact for you. Tear of the Sun was supposed to be Die Hard 4. It was taken from a book called Les Larmes du Soleil by Henri Vernes.In ""Les Larmes du Soleil"", a plane in which the hero is travelling over South America is hijacked by rebels. They intend on asking for a ransom to the Governments of the countries of the 'white' passengers. The plane crashes and the hero escapes into the amazon. Soon he hooks up with a tribe of Aztec descendants and leads them away as the rebels are after them. This book was written as Die Hard 4 but Bruce Willis liked the title so much he agreed to do Die Hard 4 if he could use the Tears of the Sun title and script for a completely different movie.Now it's about a group of Elite Navy SEALS given the simple sounding mission of rescuing a doctor (an American Citizen) from a jungle village in war-torn Nigeria as an Evil General seizes control of the country and imposes brutal ethnic cleansing. Not a pretty situation.But as soon as Willis and his hardass SEALS (including Cole Hauser, Johnny Messner and Nick Chinlund) show up the stubborn Doctor (that's the lurv-ley Monica Bellucci) refuses to budge unless she can take 70 villagers with her. Willis lies, telling her that this is fine by him as long as she agrees to go. The choppers arrive, Bellucci freaks as Willis-calling him every name under the crying sun (!) as only she is escorted to safety. Minutes later they fly over the village to find that the rebels have massacred everyone. His conscience gets the better of him, he orders the choppers back and they lead the ditched villagers to the safety of the Camaroon border through 40 miles of jungle.Trouble is, one of the villagers is a mole and someone else isn't who he says he is. As a result, what seems like every member of the Nigerian rebels go after them with about a bazillion bullets and rockets at their disposal.The difficulty lies in the fact that Tears of the Sun both does and does not glorify war. You can't really tell if the film is gung-ho or serious. But there's something quite moving and noble about a bunch of hardened commandos willing to die for a cause they've not had enough time to understand. Soldiers are humans and are too often portrayed as killing machines. There is no entertainment in the combat, only a sense of real danger and hopelessness. I actually prefer this film to the Black Hawk Down because A) it's not a jumpy, jittery blur and B) there a subtler emotional investment. Subtlety is something Black Hawk Down did NOT have. You can argue that it hardly belongs in a war film but it does give Tears of the Sun a strange edge.I have the Superbit DVD that has a brilliant 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen picture with a loud, dynamic Dolby/DTS 5.1 soundtrack. Get this version, it's only available in R2 at the moment so you'll have to import if you live outside the UK.",Tears of the Sun

The Characters were all great and extremely likable especially Willis Character. The script was excellent and it's especially well written. The Direction is awesome!. Antoine Fuqua did an excellent job it had great camera angles ,great zoom in's, wonderful location and the pace was very good!. There is TONS of blood. We get TONS of very bloody wounded soldiers, tons of people with very bloody wounds, LOTS of bloody gunshot wounds corpses with no arms or legs, lots of very bloody corpses, stabbing, a person has his guts showing (very briefly), and an exploding body. This is the best warm film(currently) that's only inferior to Saving Private Ryan(in my opinion). The Acting is Oscar Worthy!. Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances ever! (and it's Oscar worthy as well) You really get to know, love and care for his character he disobeyed most of his orders just to save those people i found that very cool!, and his chemistry with Monica Belluci was great! (Willis Rules!). Monica Belluci does a tremendous job here she is unlikable and ungrateful at first but actually turns out very likable and you also get to care for her after a while. Cole Hauser does his job well here and was quite likable. Eamonn Walker also does his job well. Johnny Messner is great here i liked him (liked him in Anaconda's too even though it sucked). Nick Chinlund does great here, i recognized him from lethal Weapon 3 and Eraser. Tom Skerritt is always good and here is no different even with the limited screen time.

This predictable and overly syrupy sweet war movie gushes lavishly with tropical intrigue hitting major highs when it reveals detailed shots of quiet commando operations and Saving Private Ryan-like war action. The good guys and bad guys are clearly marked. The usual people live and die. The heros are really big heros. And what happens to the laptop anyway when you need it the most? So much for backtracking around and fooling the enemy - surprise ambush I guess. So much for strategy. And my - ""two"" fighter-bombers can go up against a rebel army.This movie is not boring in the least, it has excitement, big explosions and very patriotic, with Americans clearly the good guys trying to save Western democracy. But I wish I could hear as well as Tom Skerritt on an a aircraft carrier, he has a strange place to have important conversations.

For an action thriller, this is mostly a dull affair. Willis sleep walks through the type of role that he's made a career out of. His team consists of a group of brave and noble men straight out of central casting. The film goes for cheap emotions by showing innocent villagers being brutalized and killed by the rebel army that's taken over the country. And of course Bruce and his boys tear up at the sight of the atrocities. Bellucci has only a few lines, but she tries to look concerned, or perhaps she is just bored.",Tears of the Sun

Willis makes a credible hero, with very good character development. The rest of the cast were very good, as well, and the characters didn't have the cliched introductions like most war movies do.'Tears of the Sun' is refreshingly without comic relief or a romance interest.

28,jamesrupert2014,Implausible feel-good movie with a high body-count,6,3 April 2019,"Hard-case Navy SEAL Lt. Waters (Bruce Willis) and his team are sent into war-torn Nigeria to extract a doctor and two missionaries. The missionaries refuse to go and the doctor insists that the rescue team take her African staff and ambulatory patients as well. Waters ostensibly agrees but then tricks the doctor into the evacuation helicopter, abandoning her people. When flying over the burning ruins of the hospital, littered with dead and mutilated bodies, Waters has a change of heart and, defying orders, returns to try to lead the Nigerians to the safety of nearby Cameroon. He soon learns that he has been duped and that there is a 'prize' amongst the refugees that is drawing the blood-thirsty rebels into hot pursuit. The film is an improbable and uneasy mix of firepower and feel-good sentimentality. The cast is fine although the Willis and the SEALS don't deliver anything other than the stereotypical Hollywood 'tough but sensitive soldier' and the doctor character (Monica Bellucci) is a bit hard to take (she is supposed to be a tough, experienced MSF type yet doesn't ever seem to really 'get' the tough situation they are in). The plot is a bit contrived and the ending is too convenient to be very satisfying. The entire film has a sense of simplistic wishful thinking: faced with a moral dilemma, highly disciplined American soldiers would 'do the right thing', disobeying orders, and risking their lives (and mission) to rescue obviously 'good' Africans from obviously 'bad' Africans. All in all, 'Tears of the Sun' is bit of a cartoon but the firefights are pretty good and lots of scummy rebels are righteously extirpated, so the film delivers on what most viewers will expect from a Bruce Willis army-action pic.",Tears of the Sun
29,thinker1691,""" I broke my own rule and gave a dam! """,7,30 September 2007,"Films about war often share several things in common. The primary ingredients are lot's of guns, good explosive action scenes and a believable story. Have one and not the others and it will surely fail. The movie "" Tears of The Sun "" has several. Our story is framed around Seal Team leader Lt. A.K.Waters (Bruce Willis) who is selected by his commanding officer Capt. Bill Rhodes (Tom Skerritt) for a simple rescue mission. He is to clandestinely enter the sovereign territory of Nigeria, a battle-scarred nation in the mists of a civil war and rescue a tiny group of white missionaries and take them to safety. Easy enough. However, the situation becomes complicated by the group's refusal to leave, or to travel without taking the African people with them. For a soldier, it's easy, take the group by force and leave the people. However, Waters' and his team, decide to become humanitarians and rescue all the Nigerian refugees whatever the consequences. The main consequence is; the team is a ten man squad and after their decision become the quarry of a thousand angry Nigerian soldiers. This is a good film for Willis, but becomes entangled within it's multiple plots. Still, it contains two of the prescribed ingredients and therefore makes for a good movie. ****",Tears of the Sun

This film shows a kindly and heroic American military that is unlikely to convince anyone except Uncle Sam fans, but the action scenes are well choreographed and the plot unfolds in a predictable yet exciting way and doesn't need too much concentration. We also get plenty of the fiery Monica Bellucci, one of Europe's greatest actresses, and looking feistier and more dazzling by the minute, as she braves the horrors of the African jungle and stands up for the 'nice' ethnic group as the 'bad' ethnic group try to hack them to bits.",Tears of the Sun

32,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Brutal, brawny war film",8,28 May 2016,"Antoine Fuqua's Tears Of The Sun is a brutal, tough war machine of a flick in the tradition of the old 70's war films, kind of like a brooding Dirty Dozen. Bruce Willis stoically heads up a team of special ops soldiers who are sent into a war torn region of Africa to rescue a doctor (Monica Belucci) from a missionary camp. Genocidal maniacs are encroaching into the area and it's no longer safe for locals or relief workers. His orders are simple: locate and extract the doctor, and no one else. However, when he comes face to face with the refugees, and their situation, he simply can't find it in himself to turn his back on them when he can do something to help. He then disobeys his orders, collects both his team, Bellucci and the Africans and makes a run through the jungle for diplomatic protected soil. His team are a grizzled band of warriors, each with their own unique qualities and opinion on his decision. Kelly (a badass, mohawk adorned Johnny Messner) believes it's too much of a risk, and not their concern). Michael 'Slo' Slowenski (Nick Chinlund, excellent and understated) takes a compasionate standpoint. Second in command Red Atkins (Cole Hauser) trusts Willis is making the right call. Soon they are pursued by the extremists, led by a hulking Peter Mensah, before King Leonidas kicked him into the Sarlak pit. The combat scenes are hard hitting, seemingly very well rehearsed and researched. The only problem for me was the overbearing and extended sequences of genocide, which are harrowing and quite tough to watch. When it's combat based it's a damn fine piece, with a rugged, thoughtful band of heroes who are an absolute joy to see in action. Rounding out the team are Eamonn Walker, Charles Ingram, Paul Francis, Chad Smith and a briefly seen Tom Skerritt as Willis's commanding officer. Tough, muscular and no nonsense, with burgeoning compassion that gives that soldiers purpouse beyond the cold lethality of the mission. Fuqua has a terrific collection of lean and mean action flicks under his belt, and this is one of the best.",Tears of the Sun

It had a story, some decent dialogue, and wasn't cheesily made like the old Die Hard series. The only downside: sometimes too preachy. Making modern war epics like an old school WWII movie is typically hard to do. TOTS tried accomplishing this endeavor, but just didn't hit the mark very well. Maybe its the confglict with Iraq or maybe I'm too cynical for this type of storyline, but the plot about Waters sticking up for the black man seems a bit pretentious, like Africans cannot help themselves without the help of Westerners with big guns. Antoine Fuqua kept his usual style down to a more subdued level (contrast vs. light) and slower editing techniques. Solid film, but sometimes the message gets to muffled.",Tears of the Sun
35,rbverhoef,Outstanding middle part surrounded by Hollywood clichés,6,21 May 2006,"'Tears of the Sun' is a movie with a message and an interesting first hour, but contains too many Hollywood clichés to really be something. We start with Lieutenant Waters (Bruce Willis) and his team of SEALS who have to rescue Dr. Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci), a priest and two nuns from a missionary post in Nigeria where murdering rebels are about to arrive. The priest and the nuns want to stay, Kendricks only wants to come if the Nigerian refugees can come too. Waters agrees only to leave them behind as soon as Kendricks is on the helicopter. Then, from the helicopter, he witnesses the result of rebels passing by and in an instant he disobeys his orders and turns the helicopter around.This is the point where the best part of the movie begins. Waters and his team are on their own now, leading the refugees to the border of Cameroon. The way his team not always agrees with his decisions but how they are loyal anyway is one of the interesting things here. Another is the way the movie dares to show the rebels and their actions, things we see parts of on the news in places like Liberia and Sudan. It gives us an impression how hopeless the situation is in some parts of Africa. The distraction here comes from Kendricks who is an obvious Hollywood plot device. She is the possible love interest, or at least the needed female character, and she must annoy Waters by constantly suggesting things that even to her must sound stupid when followed by a lot of rebels. Never mind.Then the third act starts and the movie fails to deliver what it kind of promised before. Instead of following the dramatic path it changes into the kind of action film Hollywood likes to produce. A lot of gunfire, explosions and bodies flying through the air. That's too bad since an earlier action sequence was able to show both the horrific actions of the rebels and the trained and nuanced way of SEALS dealing with a situation. During that sequence I felt a director (Antoine Fuqua) doing his job the right way, making the movie very intense. He did the same thing for the excellent 'Training Day' from the year before. His third act of 'Tears of the Sun' was sort of like an introduction to his real Hollywood adventure, 'King Arthur'.",Tears of the Sun

Though the film is not entirely without error, Tears of the Sun is noble, involving, and it's certainly not afraid to get its hands dirty.Tears of the Sun, takes us into the middle of the Nigerian civil war, when the Muslim rebels overthrew the Christian government. Lt. A. K. Waters and his team are sent in to retrieve one Dr. Kendricks and bring her to safety. When they find her, she refuses to leave without bringing the seventy souls he is harbouring in her care. Unwillingly, Waters agrees to march them to the safety of the Cameroon border, and soon he finds himself fighting against the rebels who are hot on their tail.The plot is centred around the Hollywood cliché, of the honest soldier who flips off his orders/or mission to do the right thing, but fortunately it doesn't ever feel too gimmicky. I was more bothered by the fact that the movie does too little with Monica Beluchi. Her character is so flat, that a monkey could give a better performance, like the mandrill that pops up in two or three second unit shots.So Tears of the Sun despite some room for improvement is a good watch.",Tears of the Sun

A pretty typical actioner which reminded me a little of Navy SEALs, though grittier and more believable. Willis is his usual mostly expressionless self here, yet somehow he manages to get the part of the troubled Lieutenant across very well indeed. The other actors all do their parts well and leave little that makes you frown in their portrayal of hardened special forces personnel. It was nice to see Cole Hauser in this movie. An underrated actor who is only now starting to get decent parts since his role in Pitch Black. Almost makes me want to go and see 2Fast 2Furious to see how he does in that. Almost...But back to the movie. The plot won't stretch your mind much and the ""strange"" reason why the rebels pursue the refugees so ardently isn't very hard to guess long before the characters in the story discover it. But the action is plentiful, as is the brutality portrayed. If you like sanitized action movies then this film might upset you a little. It's not for those who think that war is about pushing buttons from hundreds of miles away or that all soldiers carry a copy of the Geneva Convention in their kit and consult it regularly.But if you like gritty, realistic action movies then this will not disappoint.And now....a small rant.Oh dear God! I can't believe some of the truly stupid comments here. The concept that this movie's sole purpose was as a propaganda vehicle to make people feel better about the Iraq conflict is laughable to anyone who has a higher IQ than their shoe size.

39,screenman,Hokey And Clichéd.,6,7 June 2009,"Drawing upon all of the now expected clichés, Bruce Willis leads a team of grunts into action somewhere in Africa. You can tell he's in charge because he's the one with something stuck in his ear that never gives him ear ache. He's also the one who disregards orders with impunity, causing a ground-forces invasion and an air-strike.Those wicked black dictator types are being beastly again and it's up to nice white people to go and sort them out. There's a bunch of Christian do-gooders - the sort that pave the way to hell with their resolutely good intentions - who are in peril and must be extracted. There's also a president's son on the run after his father and family have been assassinated. And there's a spy. There's always a spy.The white Christian do-gooders are steadfast in their determination to die for a good cause and absolutely won't be rescued. A disagreeably shrewish French-American doctor, played by Monica Bellucci, will only come if she can take all of her black patients with her. Dilemmas for Mr Willis.He fools her into thinking that they can all be accommodated, only to kidnap her at the last moment. Then he has a crisis of conscience (like you do) and orders the choppers to return. They can't take them all, so it's up to him and his grunts to force-march the rest to the border.Every single trite, turgid issue of race and morality are explored amongst the foliage as the advancing beastly black blokes close in. One of Willis's team is an American Negro and he is reminded by one of his charges that - but for slavery - he would still be living in Africa, as one of them. Yes; and probably as a slave to another tribe of blacks or some despotic anti-democratic chieftain, as the vast majority still are. But let's not dwell on that.There's lots of graphic slaughter and cruelty, and lots of shooting and pyrotechnics. Many of Willis's team are killed in the rush to escape and at times it's bit like 'Aliens', but only a fraction as entertaining. Towards the end, safely across the border, the president's son is lecturing the crowd about democracy and getting their homes back and so on, and I'd very much like to know who elected him. That's about it really. There's plenty of hugging and back-slapping for those who survived and a bit of lamenting for those who didn't. But - gosh - aren't American soldiers nice? You'd hardly think they tortured people to death in prisons. Ah-well.It's worth a watch, but a bit naff.

And do you know why the world panicked because about 600 people died of SARS when several thousand children die every month of malaria and nobody seems to care? Well if you don't maybe this movie will help you to find the answer. A half a dozen or so of a special operations military group from USA is assigned to rescue some white people caught in the middle of Nigerian civil war. After having a look at what is going on there its commander decides to disobey orders and rescue a lot of Africans as well, taking not only the disciplinary risk of such an action but also the enormous physical risk inherent to the operation and disregarding also the political and diplomatic consequences of his attitude. The rest is a realistic action movie with very moving sequences where courage, loyalty, solidarity and good feelings are the main ingredients.

Each death is an agony to watch, shot in graphic PRIVATE RYAN style. Willis is great as he transforms from goosestepping soldier to caring human being. Monica Belluci plays a doctor who has been caring for these people and won't leave without them. She reminded me of Rachel Weisz, which is not a bad thing. I cried a river,and you will, too.",Tears of the Sun

But the doctor will not leave without the refugees she has saved..This isn't the greatest war movie or rescue film I've seen...There were scenes were I physically felt sick seeing the atrocities committed by the governments of foreign nations and then there was the horribly intense scenes were the soldiers sat around giving a big speech about 'Doing the right thing'...It's a no-brainer! If I was in a jungle and had to save people...I would do it in a heartbeat!The plot very slowly builds up..I guess the Director tried to involve the audience into the story...The come the shoot-outs, which are satisfactory....But very cheesy....Next, thing...Bruce Willis..He isn't going to win 'Personality of the Year', anytime soon..But he brings his 80's Action Hero gimmick to the table and it just about holds the film together...But overall too cheesy to take serious.",Tears of the Sun
45,TheUnknown837-1,"Despite being aware of its noble ambitions, I found myself becoming distracted all too easily",6,22 April 2011,"When I saw ""Tears of the Sun,"" I was ever-aware of what it was trying to do. It was aiming for high standards and goals, trying to strike a chord by showing the horrible things that happen on a daily basis in other parts of the world. It tried to show violence as dehumanizing. And despite the fact that it did accomplish these goals, I nevertheless found myself all too easily distracted while I was watching it. Maybe because what it does achieve is really superficial, not deep, and the deja vu feeling kept on creeping in.It's well-made by director Antoine Fuqua and has some great star talent such as Bruce Willis, Monica Belluci, Tom Skerritt, and Johnny Messner. Mr. Willis stars as the leader of a SpecialOps unit assigned to rescue a famous doctor's wife (Miss Belluci) from the war-infested jungles of Nigeria. She refuses to leave her hospital unless the 70-some patients can be taken as well. Of course, as plot mechanics require, Mr. Willis initially cons her but later has a change of heart and escorts her and her refugees through the jungle in hopes of reaching safety as a rebel force comes stamping upon their necks.I think the two words ""plot mechanics"" properly declare why I became distracted. Because for all of its high goals and targets, ""Tears of the Sun"" only accomplishes what so many other stylish action movies of the past have. And so by blending these two drastically different elements so clumsily, the movie develops a sort of identity crisis and really bogs down. Moments meant to be emotional failed to tug my heartstrings. Violence meant to make me retch only accomplish so because of its ostensible characteristics, nothing psychological. Plot twists meant to make me raise my eyebrows, such as the big one that answers the movie's big question in the middle, didn't have any jarring effect on me. By contrast, I kept on imagining how this movie could have been (and should have been) better.For all its ambitions, ""Tears of the Sun"" really becomes tiresome after a while and it becomes very easy to lose interest, even in the middle of its drawn-out, visually explosive climax. There aren't any people for us to really associate ourselves with. Despite their talent, Mr. Willis and Miss Belluci are just cop-outs from dozens of other movies of the past. For that very same reason, I was just so happy their final scene didn't conclude with a kiss. That's one of the few ways this could have been even more conventional than it already is.",Tears of the Sun
46,DunnDeeDaGreat,Good movie but it's more Three Kings than Black Hawk Down,8,1 March 2003,I just got out of an advance screening for Tears Of The Sun and I found it to be a pretty enjoyable movie. Antione Fuquia follows up Training Day with this war movie which is kinda limtied on action and more on trying to get it's message across. Bruce Willis gives a finer performace here then he did in Hart's War and Cole Hauser is all over his role as Red. The action sequences the film does have though are intesne not as intense as Black Hawk Down though. If you want a good enjoybale film then check this one out.,Tears of the Sun
47,mentalcritic,Enjoyable drama set in an undeclared war...,7,20 November 2004,"The world we live in is a dangerous, unstable place, and nowhere is this more evident than in Africa, the place where many things of our world, AIDS included, are said to originate. Indeed, about the only thing that cannot be found in Africa is oil, which makes American interest in the region difficult to imagine, leave alone explain. So when we are presented with a story about a war in Africa, it only stands to reason that we must ask exactly why we see American soldiers.Bruce Willis gives a delightfully underacted performance as the leader of an infantry unit sent to retrieve a handful of American citizens. Things get complicated when the primary objective refuses to leave without dozens of her patients. Instead of simply escorting one woman to safe territory, the party winds up in a race to the Cameroon border with one substantial territorial force in pursuit. Exactly why this force pursues them, we don't know until the climactic battles are about to take place, but it works.Indeed, the actors here are not even noticeable, excepting maybe Tom Skerritt, who looks as if he spent his salary on diet pills. Instead, the sumptuous locations and cinematography, along with the action, are the stars of this film. This is a good old-fashioned action film, in spite of its very relevant story. What makes it stand out is that instead of modern action where nobody can see enough of what is going on for it to matter or make sense, we get our action scenes the old fashioned way. Blood spurts, detailed shots of the guns going off, or weapons striking flesh, are a reality rather than a much lamented unfulfilled requisite.There are some problems, but they are minor in the grand scheme of things. When one shows fighter planes dropping air-to-surface weapons, it is usually an idea to get those weapons right. Using air-to-air missiles to drop napalm, for example, is not on. At least the dire action films of the 1980s used weapons in a manner that was convincing. The believability of a commanding officer allowing such violations of orders is very difficult to imagine, to say the least. Then again, given that these minor lapses happen once or twice during a two-hour film, this can be overlooked.I gave Tears Of The Sun a seven out of ten. It's not at the level of a Verhoeven action film, or even a Cameron action film. It is, on the other hand, a good piece of entertainment with a decent and human edge, with sequences that have been competently shot. Which puts it ahead of a lot of films on today's market already.",Tears of the Sun
48,RJBurke1942,Brought me to tears  for all the wrong reasons.,1,16 June 2007,"Tinsel Town has produced some of the best war films ever made (From Here to Eternity, Home of the Brave, The Thin Red Line, Flags of our fathers). This is not one of them  not even close.Bruce Willis has starred in some of the best action movies ever made (Die Hard, Pulp Fiction, Unbreakable, 16 Blocks) where he also shows that he can truly act. This is not one of them  not even close.Perhaps I'm unfair in comparing this story with those other war movies because this is not a war movie, per se: it's just another vehicle for Hollywood to con the American public into believing and accepting that US forces can go wherever they want to as long as there's somebody to rescue from oppressive forces within a country in political chaos.From a narrative perspective, the story is pedestrian, formulaic, predictable and banal. The characters are stereotypical, wooden, one-dimensional caricatures. The cinematography and editing are adequate to the job at hand  rescue a white female (natch!) French (natch!) doctor (natch!) with the walking sick and wounded from her hospital in the Nigerian jungle -- and the special effects produce the required shock and awe from viewers, no doubt. The saccharine sound track, however, should have been left in the can. Give me Ride of the Valkyries in Apocalypse Now (1979) anytime, puleeeese...But what's truly imaginative, even astounding  not to say magical  is how Bruce and his cohorts gallivant through the jungle to finally face down the overwhelming forces of evil, and stride  upright no less -- manfully forward with guns blazing, heedless of the RPGs, machine guns and other small arms  and hardly a bullet or piece of shrapnel touches them. Oh, a couple of his men fall, heroes all, but Bruce with his coterie of favorites breaks through, and, with a little bit of help from a couple of convenient F-18 Hornets, by God and US Might, finally reach Safety on The Other Side of The Fence.And the last we see of Bruce is with the good doctor, she cradling his (only slightly) wounded body (and soul) as they both rise in the almost white Blackhawk chopper flying off into the sunset.Thankfully, this film is now forgotten by me; alas, it's not gone from the scene yet. Hopefully, it'll be consigned to the can, where the music should be anyway, and you'll never see it. You'd be far better off watching Snow White (1937), I kid you not.",Tears of the Sun
49,tomimt,For our sins.,7,20 August 2006,"Unlike most other American war movies 'Tears Of The Sun' has very little the standardized ""we Americans shall save you all from yourselves"" attitude. Also the particular flag waving usually connected to movies like this is almost invisible.'Tears of The sun' tells about a crisis. A humanitarian crisis in Africa and a personal crisis of a man, who is tired of seeing suffering people just as objectives of a mission, which can be discarded like empty magazines if the situation calls it. Brice Willis is Lieutenant Waters, who is sent on a rescue mission to get an American doctor Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) out from a missionary in Nigeria before the rebels kill her. When he and his team arrives, Kendricks refuses to leave without the sick and wounded people she has been aiding and so the soldiers take 70 people with them and start evacuating them all against the mission orders.We see some cruel things happening during the movie, in fact the story lingers its own time to show the viewers of how cruel humans can be on each other and on that it does succeed far better than one horror film I could mention. I'm speaking of 'Hostel' of course.But after all this cruelty there is a small spark of humanity beyond and after all the violence and betrayal. Willis has done much worse pictures than 'Tears of The Sun' is. The film ends up in a typical over blown action scene, but there are a lot of shreds of thought planted inside of the movie as well. The cruelty won't stop if we don't react on it.",Tears of the Sun
50,bopdog,Entertaining AND important! This movie may prompt us to finally find answers to world peace.,10,15 March 2003,"Many war movies can prod the audience to feel good about killing. Specifically, killing enemies, to be sure. ""Tears of the Sun"" is a rare war movie in that it makes the audience feel strongly about saving lives. It is not naive--- there are truly evil enemies here, the movie contains no misguided attempts at appeasing evil doers. One fascinating fact about this movie is that the enemies (and the friendlies, to some extent) speak a foreign language, unknown, probably, to the vast bulk of those who will see the film. We don't know what they are saying, nor even why the two sides are angry with each other. That strong anonymity, coupled with an up-close and ultra vivid ""face"" on each and every person, enemy and victim alike, helps to shake off any attempts at political or even ethnic side-taking. It cleverly forces us to view war and brutality (etc.) in universally human terms. The enemy is each of us, and any of us when we thirst to shed others' blood. The victims are each of us as well: our wives, husbands, parents, children, friends and neighbors, etc.No simple solutions are given here. In a strange way, the movie isn't really offering a moral map of any kind, even though the dramatic narrative was well drawn for the purposes of telling the movie's story. But I couldn't help thinking that the movie forced many audience members to begin thinking about this issue for themselves. ""Tears of the Sun"" may have the effect of prompting and encouraging all of us to take some steps to courageously begin to find the answers that have thus far eluded the human race.AND--- it's an exciting movie!

A group of special forces types slips into war-torn Nigeria to rescue a doctor and her team, but she insists they also take back with them a handful of refugees. Little does Willis' team know the son of the newly deposed Nigerian president is among the refugees, and the insurgents who now hold power will stop at nothing to get him. How's that for a plot? Heard it before, have you? How about the doctor is a babe (Monica Bellucci) who falls for Willis, and he for she? Gawd. Much of the dialog is cringe-inducing, and most of the performances are subpar and stereotyped. At least the film looks nice, having been shot in Hawaii. Essentially, you have a white American guy and his all-American, GI Joe commando team rescuing a bunch of poor, innocent black Africans from a bunch of sadistic, murderous black Africans -- and I say this, acknowledging that Willis has at least one black guy on his team.

The things went haywire when he decides not to follow the rules and try to rescue everyone at the same time. Anyway the movie is very entertaining, with Bruce, he really suits the role and is one of the rescue movies that should be watch.

53,Aylmer,Haven't I seen this before?,6,8 March 2003,"This movie is basically this:  PREDATOR with certain elements from BLACK HAWK DOWN and WE WERE SOLDIERS mixed in for good measure.  The plot isn't entirely believable, with U.S. Soldiers frequently disobeying orders and breaking the rules of engagement and their superiors being basically A-OK with all of this.  Lots of overly familiar situations too, like the whole ""Why did you save me?"" ""It's my job."" dialog as is normally found in brainless action movies.What separates this film from any usual direct-to-DVD action movie made these days besides Bruce Willis and a mailed-in cameo role by Tom Skerrit, is that this movie tries to be ""powerful"" by showing the horror that sub-Saharan starving Africans have to put up with from day to day.  Willis and co. save a whole town from dastardly devilish rebels, but just leave the people there to fend for themselves afterward (easy to guess what happened to them afterward).  What ever message there is is lost by the total lack of realism in the combat scenes (""let's just walk forward and shoot randomly at trees!""), which get the sound effects right but don't make sense and get redundant.  Watch WILD TEAM or COMMANDO LEOPARD instead.  Both were cheesy 80's action films from Italy with pretty much the exact same plot (mercenaries/soldiers fight ""bad guy"" army while escorting a politically important refugee through the jungle).  Both those flicks were probably made for less than 1/20th of the advertising budget of this film too.

I loved Saving Private Ryan, Courage Under Fire and The Dam Busters. This film is nowhere near as good as those, but it is still quite good. The story was good and the acting was good most of the time, but it was too slow. It took a long time for anything to happen. It was not exactly a fast paced film. It was kin of depressing in places too. There were a few scenes that looked like news footage of people being tortured, beaten and shot. If this was not actual news footage, it was very convincing because it was a little uncomfortable to watch. There were some very brutal scenes.I did like this film, I just think that the pace was just a little too slow.I will give this film 6 out of 10.Not Bruces best, but better than expected.For more reviews, please check out my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Tears of the Sun

56,PyrolyticCarbon,"A harrowing, gritty and truthful movie that pulls no punches, with utterly believable performances",9,10 April 2005,"I knew I was guaranteed excitement and explosions with Bruce Willis involved in a war\action flick, but I wasn't prepared for his outstanding performance, a huge strong cast alongside him and a punishing film which highlights the pain and genocide that Africa struggles with year after year.Antoine Fuqua directs in epic style, with fantastic backdrops, big camera sweeps and hugely powerful scenes. He shows again that he can more than ably deliver the quality and cinematic style that he did with Training Day. The movie is powerful and compelling and beautifully filmed.Willis had hold of this story from 1995 and it seems a passionate piece for him, and I find that quite amazing that not only can he give it up so easily to a new Director, but that he also produces such a restrained and controlled performance. This really shows his maturity as an actor and producer.It's in front of the screen that he really excels though, his performance in the earlier part of the movie reflects a controlled and strong soldier. Possibly his best movie to date. The actors around him in his squad are a perfect pick, apart from a slight tendency to facially overact from Eamonn Walker, they exude the qualities of a close knit team of professional soldiers. The authenticity is not just with their interaction together but also with their equipment, their use of weapons and tactics, nothing happens throughout the movie to make you doubt who they are portraying.However all this is secondary to the story they are pulled into, that of genocide and ethnic cleansing, and the sheer evil and inhumanity of the acts of violence against the people of Africa by the people of Africa. It draws your eyes to the plight that millions of Africans are facing year after year in different countries, and the harrowing individual acts that are carried out for the most pointless of reasons.There are some moments that lean towards Hollywood but that's all they do, before they go too far and bend the dramatic storyline away from the more believable the scene comes right back on track. In fact there are scenes that are deliberately non-Hollywood, and from what the Director and Willis have said, they wanted to keep it that way.Overall this movie is excellent. A harrowing, gritty and truthful movie that pulls no punches, with utterly believable and strong performances from Willis and his team, and a fantastic performance by Monica Bellucci, beautiful despite the amount of mud thrown at her.",Tears of the Sun

58,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,4 April 2005,"After a slow start Tears of the Sun turns into a decent semi-action movie with a fair amount of tension. Bruce Willis stars as Lieutenant Waters who, along with a small group of soldiers is sent into Nigeria to 'rescue' any American citizens from impending death, as rebel fighters are entering the area intending to kill any outsiders. They have just wiped out the President and his family and are taking control, and the Americans are not allowed to interfere. Primary target is Dr. Kendricks played by Monica Bellucci, the foreign widow of an American. Secondary targets for rescue are nuns. Tom Skerrit plays Willis's superior, and sends the team in with strict orders not to engage the enemy. Of course, when they reach the doctor she refuses to leave as she has many injured patients. Willis acts as the bad guy, but eventually agrees to take 70 refugees with them, knowing that only the Doctor will be airlifted out. However, when the remaining doctors and patients are killed, Willis disobeys orders and returns to take the 70 refugees over the border to safety. However, the rebels are on their tail and no help is coming, and a twist reveals an important person among the refugees.The film's main faults lie in the fact that as an action movie there is little action for the majority of the movie, and as a drama there is not enough interaction between the characters to make us care for them too much. However, the performances from Bellucci, Willis and co. are all good, there are some tense scenes, the surroundings are stunning, and the final chase when the enemy catches up is very well executed. The issues of American intrusion, good vs evil, and morality are tackled well for a film of this type and much sympathy is aimed towards the victims of the conflict. Unfortunately some of the other soldiers are not given much screen time, and many look similar so we do not know who is who, undermining the emotional impact of the battle scenes. However, the fact that they all come to see that their jobs as soldiers is not to help their own citizens, but to protect the innocent at all costs, regardless of race. Overall a good attempt at mixing action and drama.7.5 out of 10",Tears of the Sun
59,johnnymacbest,A haunting portrayal of human savagery.,8,25 April 2009,"There will always be war, anytime anyplace. Yet there's no clear oppressor or regime to fight against, although there are ideologies and to some extent, ethnic cleansing; the likes of which are seen in some parts of Europe and Africa. But the real point is why humans kill each other? Unfortunately, there are no easy answers.And that is what the main point in Tears of the Sun, directed with precision by Antoine Fuqua. This is one of Bruce Willis's best action movies but it has an underlying message about going against authority in order to achieve the greater good; however perilous and uncertain it may be against overwhelming odds. Unlike Blackhawk Down (which I also happen to like) which has quick cuts and unstable camera angles, TOTS has action scenes that are easy to follow and above all, make the film more watchable and understandable. The special effects are impressive, showing the brutal carnage of war, extremely gory yes, but never at the expense of the film itself. The only gripe I have is Monica Bellucci. Her performance is not bad, but ""serviceable"". But the unknown African actors are more believable and convincing alongside Bruce and co minus Bellucci.I think Tears of the Sun deserves more credit than it has received. Surely, the latter is more popular among moviegoers but if you want an action/war movie that's a little more on the surface, then I see why not you should check TOTS.

60,mOVIemAN56,Powerful,9,24 April 2005,"I'm always flipping through channels for a good action flick. I remembered seeing a preview for this when I was at the movies but never decided to go see it. A couple of months ago STARZ showed it and I was surprised. there was no hype, no support, and really no appreciating reviews that I read or saw. But I watched it. As civil war rages in the African country of Nigeria. U.S. citizens are stuck in the war-torn country and Special-Op soldiers under the command of Lt. A.K Waters (Bruce Willis) is sent in to retrieve the American doctor Lena Fiore Kendricks (Monica Bellucci). After arriving at her clinic she refuses to leave unless 70 refugees are taken to safe haven with them.Water's, a fiercely loyal man decides that the only way to complete the mission is to save them too. Now it is a race across the Nigerian jungle with ruthless rebels chasing them. I'm still not sure if this is based on actual events, I know that many countries in Africa have gone through civil war but I'm not sure about this.Bruce Willis' character develops through the duration of the movie from a hardened soldier to a complex, caring character focused on saving the refugees. Monica Bellucci is making a name for herself with this, The Passion of the Christ (2004) and both matrix sequels (2003-2004). The movie did not receive what it deserved. this could probably be considered the predecessor of Hotel Rwanda (2004) focusing on the same subject of genocide. The film is slow at some parts but the amazing battle scenes held in the forest and the representation of cruelty of the rebels keep the movie going. Some scenes are hard to endure, the slaughter of an entire village including the children and babies. Bombs incinerating refugees as the run from the rebels.The movie doesn't stray from its point and the ignoring of the world toward the civil wars raging in Africa (currently Sudan).Tears of the Sun.

However one very good thing about the movie is that it opens by and gets underway straight away without wasting any time and dives straight into the action. There are some typical but very well shot action scenes and sequences. There really is no need for character development although what was good was that at times we get to see stereotypically hard as nails marines who have a human side. We also get a small look at the fragile world of African politics which only gets a bit of coverage during the 6pm evening news and there were some genuinely horrific scenes in it. Both Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci were excellent and everyone who played a marine although the script felt a little basic and the bads guys just felt like stereotypical bad guys and it just became good vs bad Hollywood type of movie.

63,Shiva-11,From tears of boredom to tears of laughter,5,8 March 2003,"One would be hard pressed to find a medium that has not glorified the institution of war. It has credited with turning boys into men, spurring economic and social revolutions, and delivering the oppressed from enslavement. Amazingly, the downsides destruction, famine and of course death  often get overlooked. It wasn't until Oliver Stone's `Platoon' hit the big screen that laymen got a glimpse into the real ugliness of war. I remember an interview with a Vietnam Vet who after seeing a preview screening of ""Platoon"" stated (I'm paraphrasing) `If I had seen this instead of `The Green Berets' I never would have gone to Vietnam in search of heroism.' Hopefully this generation will not have to learn this lesson first hand. When a violent coup pushes Nigeria to the brink of civil war, Lieutenant AK Water (Willis) and his crew of navy SEALS are sent in to extract Lena Hendricks (Belluci), an American doctor doing missionary work in the country. Dr. Hendricks is reluctant to leave her charges, and demands that they also be evacuated, leading to a cross country race to escape the vicious hordes of the rebel army. The timing of this film's release is quite fitting given the prevailing global climate, but don't worry I'm not about to launch into a polemic about international events, this is a movie review after all. Suffice it to say I'm sure the distributor is counting on this to stimulate some box office. That's about the only thing that will save this film. The first thing that struck me was that although `Tears of the Sun' is being billed as an action film, it plods along at a snails pace for the first hour and fifteen minutes. The movie also embodies everything that can go wrong with a war film: it is jingoistic, filled with scowling stock villains, is nonsensically simplistic reducing everything to black and white and limps along with ridiculous dialogue eg. After Willis' character is slashed with a machete and blood is literally flowing down his hand he dismisses attempts to help him saying `Don't worry I'm okay.' Let's not forget the classic disposable armies  we're expected to accept that in spite of vastly superior numbers and firepower, the enemy soldiers are notoriously poor shots losing at least a hundred soldiers for every good guy that bites the dust. There's also the genocide - or should I say ""ethnic cleansing"" to help offend your moral senses.Even if I could get past all these failings, I can't forgive the crux of the story, that Waters' epiphany that leads him  a dedicated and stoic soldier's soldier -to countermand a direct order. Normally this would earn one a court martial and an all expenses paid trip to Leavenworth to turn big rocks into little rocks. In this case however, even though he essentially sparks a war and unnecessarily risks the lives of his men, he still gets the girl, the glory and hero's homecoming. It boggles the mind.
I was going to address the performances, but what is there left to say? I've always enjoyed Bruce Willis whether he was being self-mocking in `Die Hard' or serious in `The Sixth Sense'. Unfortunately he is forced to utter some of the most ridiculous dialogue I've heard in a long time and his attempts to sound dramatic come off as cartoonish. His co-stars fare no better.
I can't leave without mentioning two screw-ups that I couldn't help dwell on: first how is it that the SEAL's facial camouflage magically disappears (the only time I tried it it took forever to wash off); second despite rain, sweat, and tramping through jungle foliage and muck Belucci's character's lipstick is always perfectly applied.

Check. - The notion that an army of 7 can fight off an army of 300? Check.I could go on and on, but you get the idea. This movie is a cliché based on a cliché of clichés. As I watched it, I could not remove the idea from my head (especially about the ending about good guys being evil if they don't do stuff about bad guys) that this movie was a propaganda vehicle, just as the nazi films of Germany, circa 1930's were.The idea, basically, is that the africans are simply not up to the task of defending themselves, so americans have to go in and fight for them. Along the way, we learn that American soldiers would love to die for a couple of unknowns in a faraway land (even if oil is not involved - what a surprise!), and that the enemy will never be able to fight 7 soldiers, no matter how well armed they are. They will not hear the shots, the footsteps, or the talking of the american soldiers, and if they do, they will never shoot. And if they actually shoot, somehow the american soldiers will be able to spring back into action, while a single bullet will always kill the enemy.What a waste of time this movie was.",Tears of the Sun
65,fredgfinklemeyer,Good Movie-Excellent Actors-Unrealistic Storyline,7,2 January 2019,"01/01/2019 I enjoyed this Bruce Willis movie like I always do, but the military actions within the storyline would never have ever taken place as the we're all good guys and don't follow orders fantasies portrayed. Soldiers would have been court martialed for their failure to follow orders that was portrayed. A fantasy storyline at best, which ruined the remainder of the movie for me ... plus a happy sappy sap sucker, mush fest, only in Hollywood ending. Bon Appetit
My favorite ending might have been?

66,monkeysgalore,"Emotional, Action-Packed, and Visceral; One of Fuqua's Best",10,5 April 2020,"A gritty war movie and an emotional action movie, Tears of the Sun is an excellent film. Guided by the steady hand of Antoine Fuqua, one of my favorite directors, it stages some truly moving dramatic scenarios and some wholly entertaining large-scale action scenes.Tears of the Sun feels a little like Three Kings (1999) for the new millennium, only without the comedy and heist plot, and with more protagonists. I was reminded of this movie while watching Three Kings, and while they are definitely different, there are some similarities.The parts with the rebels and villagers really pull on your heart strings, and I was really pulled into the plot. The movie has kind of a slow pace, but moves along fine. The villains were also good, and it's been a while since I actually wanted to see the bad guys punished in a movie, but this achieved that.Bruce Willis is perfect as the leader of the group of soldiers, and he is not his usual self. He is much more reserved here, like his performance in Twelve Monkeys (1995), and gone are the one-liners and sarcasm. The other actors are great in their roles too, especially Monica Bellucci, who acted very well, and didn't just stand there being hot the whole time.The movie has three big action sequences, the village assault, and two large battles in the end. Antoine Fuqua is known for his excellent action scenes, and this is no exception. He handles them very well, and they're gritty and violent.An excellent war film, Tears of the Sun is a very moving and powerful movie even if it is fiction. It works on every level; as a stylish action film, as a dirty war film, and a emotional drama. Definitely one of Willis' and Fuqua's better movies.",Tears of the Sun

It's an emotionally driven movie that is very well acted and to my surprise contains only one major clichéd scene, which comes and goes in a few minutes and can be forgiveable. Otherwise the movie stays hard on the intensity throughout. It only drags a little but at just two hours I can't be too stressed about it. If you take away one thing from my review it's this: by the end, I didn't find the action memorable, but the emotional distress.

It tries to show audiences the horrors of civil unrest and ethnic cleansing but sadly they tried too hard to get it across that the quality of the film suffered. Bruce Willis in his battle hardened bad-ass Marine mode is effective. I mean, he's so used to playing roles like that anyway so I'm sure he didn't have a problem adjusting and such.Feisty Italian stunner Monica Bellucci was quite annoying at time with that disgruntled accent of hers top to that the stupid things her character does in the film. She was really hot though I'll give her that.The one scene that annoyed the most is the part where this guy with the under developed mohawk got hit by a sniper and then the rest of his team starts shooting at the trees on the other side. They were in a vertical tactical position and they're advancing towards the unseen enemy and they're shooting at nothing. To be honest, they looked like a bunch of retards. And they call themselves Special Ops. What the hell.Tears of the Sun is an average war film with a message. They tried to get the message across so hard that the quality of the film suffered.",Tears of the Sun

71,huh_oh_i_c,"Americans, as Americans were intended to be.",9,20 May 2006,"In the last 6 years especially, we've gotten used to quite a negative image of American soldiers. They are basically abused by this Republican administration to protect US oil interests in general, and Halliburtons bottom line in particular. Also since Vietnam and Chili, this perception of Americans has been that of the American soldier which represented greed, egotism and protection of purely American interests. Instead of humane values. Two exceptions are (brief) incidents in Somalia and Kosovo, which seemed to be motivated by selflessness.I totally understand that it's difficult for Americans to hear or acknowledge this (even Democrats), but nobody really believes that Bush would've invaded and occupied an oil-less Iraq. Nobody, except 'red'-staters and the ideologically blind, thinks that American soldiers are acting to protect democratic values around the world or something like that.So it's very moving and heartwarming to see a film were American soldiers show a great display of unselfishness, and sacrifice themselves for a group of people which basically are useless to them except for their eternal gratitude. This is how we were brought up to perceive Americans: Big, though, rugged men, with an endless supply of chewing gum, who always came in to rescue the oppressed and the needy. In a totally matter-of-factly way and without breaking their stride. These are Americans, how Americans were intended to be: Heroes! Rescuers of the world, and always fighting and sacrificing themselves to protect the innocent and the weak.In this way the movie is a strong critique on the war in Iraq: There, Americans are in it for the money, while sacrificing poor whites for the sake of the rich political elite, here, simply soldier sacrificing THEMSELVES for the weak and unarmed. Sadly, it's not realistic, and this is also how we recognize 'Tears of the Sun' as fiction. (White) American soldiers sacrificing their lives for black Africans, and that's normal? This is of course highly fictitious. At least, this has historically never happened.The film is truly devastating. Simply very well made technically, beautifully shot, with enough eye for the beautiful Nigerian landscape. This also what makes the film so bittersweet: The most awful of war crimes against humanity are committed in a painfully beautiful scenery, which certainly looks very green and fertile and .... full of life. And the film is full of death.The action scenes, just like the opening of Saving Private Ryan, drive home what I already knew on an intellectual, rational level: War is bad, it's really bad, it's ugly and it smells like old sjit in a pile of rotting dogcorpes. Nothing glorious about it whatsoever. However, the revenge for ethnic cleansing scene is really what everyone would hope to happen. Is it realistic that no Americans die in that scene? Yes, since they take them completely by surprise. War is not a case of two more or less equal forces, trading blow after blow, where the smartest tactical move wins out. War has always been a case of who ambushes who first, or a case of an overwhelmingly stronger force killing off the weaker one by the sheer use of violence and not some brilliant tactical ploy.The acting is really good, Willis convinces as the hard-boiled Lieutenant, Belluci likewise, Malik Bowens as the evil Colonel is well cast and really looks utterly mean and scary. And at the Monica Belluci looks awful and old. Quite realistically. It highly adds to the realism that most of those soldiers don't make it in the end. In real life of course, the rescuing jets would miss their target or develop friendly fire. Most likely there wouldn't be an intervention by jets at all. Actually this is one of the few plot holes. It's pretty inconceivable that the US would sent in soldiers anywhere where they didn't have air superiority. Are we to believe that the Nigerian air-force is gonna kick the Airforce's butt? Get real.",Tears of the Sun
72,ilovedolby,A moderate film that doesn't insult its audience with stupidity.,6,11 March 2003,"Antoine Fuqua, director of `Training Day,' the critically successful film that garnished Denzel Washington an Academy Award for Best Actor, now brings us `Tears Of The Sun.' This film comes at a turbulent time in America with the possibility of war looming. However, the execs at Sony Pictures decided that American audiences could handle a war related film. Over the past two years, films with subject matter related to terrorism or war have been handled with kid gloves,' due to 9/11. 	`Tears Of The Sun' is not a bad movie. However, it runs counter to territory covered so many times before that I'm not sure audiences are really willing to keep watching it. Two superior films, in particular preceded `Tears,' `Three Kings,' and `Black Hawk Down.' What made those films stick out was the fact that they dealt with intricate plot twists, and both films used visual distortion to create a sense of confusion or tension. Looking at those films alone from a creative standpoint, they make `Tears' appear trite. But I can't down `Tears' too much. It was an average film with relatively good acting and was well directed. 	In `Tears Of The Sun,' Bruce Willis stars as a lieutenant assigned to rescue an American missionary working in a Nigerian jungle during a rebellion. When he arrives with his platoon, the missionary played by Monica Bellucci refuses to leave without 40 refugees. It comes to a point where Willis's character has to decide whether to simply follow orders and save Bellucci's character, or he can do the right thing and try to save the refugees from rebel troops who are invading the jungle.	Willis is known for his performances in action films. Who could forget his role as John McClane in the Die Hard films? His best work was in two recent films from director M. Night Shyamlan-`The Sixth Sense,' and `Unbreakable.' Willis pulls off a believable performance in `Tears' And of course, it wouldn't be a Willis flick without him squinting his eyes and kicking someone's butt. 	The real talent of `Tears Of The Sun' rests in the hands of Monica Belluci. She is best known to audiences for her role in the Italian film, `Malena.' However, she is certainly making her presence known in America not only for her role in `Tears,' but for her work in the upcoming `Matrix' sequels due out on May 15 and November 7. Also, she is set to star in `The Passion,' a film about the last hours of Jesus Christ, directed by Mel Gibson and due out in 2004. She will play Mary Magdalene opposite James Caviezel as Jesus.	There are some minor inconsistencies in the film that I had a few troubles with. For example, a scene where Bruce Willis tells his commander played by Tom Skerritt, over a satellite phone that he is going against the mission to save the lives of the refugees. I just found it curious that Skerritt's character was speaking on the deck of an aircraft carrier while planes are taking off. It makes it difficult to hear the dialogue between the two characters. And it begs the question, why the hell didn't Skerritt just take the call inside the ship to begin with. Naturally, one can argue that Fuqua chose to shoot this scene on the deck of a ship to create an uneasy feel. But it doesn't work very well. 	Other inconsistencies rest in the fact that the film is to some extent, dull. There's at least 10 minutes of trudging through the jungle that proves to be boring for the audience. Let's face some facts here. The target audience for `Tears' is primarily people who have come to see an action film, so why not give it to them? And when the action scenes do occur, there's nothing that we haven't seen before: the conventional explosions in the jungle, and sniper shots. And the very ending of the film resembles that of `Three Kings' to a tee. 	The highlight of the show was the score composed by Academy Award winner Hans Zimmer, whose work has left an indelible impression on me; his scores for such films as `Gladiator,' and `Hannibal' were remarkable. Also, I have to point out the distinguished harmonious voice of singer Lebo M., whose South African songs and chants have been used in several films of note, including `The Lion King,' and `Congo.' 	At any rate, `Tears Of The Sun' was a moderate film that doesn't insult its audience with stupidity that so many other action films have a tendency to do. **1/2",Tears of the Sun
73,moviedude1,World's oldest living lieutenant?,8,29 July 2003,"This movie was excellent!  The scenery as they walked through the jungles of Africa was great!  A mission presented to a US Navy SEAL team should go off without a hitch, until the world's oldest living navy lieutenant goes up against the extraction target: a doctor that the US deems a must to get out of the jungles of Africa before the rebels catch up to her.I never could understand some of the reasons why the military does things the way they do, but it's done that way, none-the-less.  Bruce Willis does an outstanding job in this movie, a lot better than Hart's War, and the way he tries to handle the situations presented to him are typical of the way the military reacts to any situations.  But the first time that doctor would have presented a struggle to leaving, they would have packed her up and hauled her off, themselves.And then there's the fact that Willis is only a lieutenant!  The man is 48 yrs old & he's still a looey?  Come on!  He would have been drummed out of the service after he missed the test after, what, the third time?  And what was with the camouflage makeup in only the first scene, and then it's gone? If there were any technical advisers on this film, they should be re-assigned to another area other that making films.

I understand the bigger moral story here about compassion and 'what's right' and all that jazz.... but C'MON!  At least make the person the SEALS are here to save be SOMEWHAT supportive of their efforts.  Dr. Kendricks has to go down in history as one of the most hated movie characters in the history of cinema!!!  First she doesn't want to leave her people.  So Bruce Willis & Co. go through all the trouble of taking them to the drop-off point just to leave them....WHAT WAS THE POINT?  it seems like Fuqua just had to find a way to make the movie longer so he came up with this.  Anyway, the doctor then withholds information from da SEALS, knowing damn well one of them are relaying their position to the rebels.  I would've knocked her out, find your way to the drop-off and head home.....THERE!  Movie finished! Realistically, it should have been done in an hour tops.I was very suprised by Fuqua....I expected a lot from him after 'Training Day'.  The U.S. propaganda in this film is sickening.  To see all of those Nigerians murdered (rebels & innocents) made me sick to my stomach...and to this day I will never know how Fuqua (an African-American like me) was able to do this film with a straight conscience.  Bruce Willis returns to his old form and that's good to see...although I'm sure the makeup crew forgot to put the Superman emblem on his chest.  Could someone please tell me how he was just 'shrugging' off the numerous bullet wounds/knife chops he was receiving?  The 'Red' character is easily my favorite...he was really cool.All in all this film is a mass of nothing.  Aside from Bruce Willis' return to the action genre which was good, Tears of the Sun is tasteless.

After killing all those who remained behind, the rebels hunt down the Lieutenant and his caravan. Eventually they learn there is a spy in their midst who is being forced to track them by the rebels, who are holding his family under threat. Why are these rebels so obsessed by this small group of refugees? It turns out that the son of recently assassinated President is in hiding in the group. The Lieutenant and the commandos agree to assist him. On the trek they witness another rebel group committing rape, genocide and torture in a small village.

Bruce Willis took a chance and co-produced via Cheyenne Enterprises, and the film was not financially successful. Perhaps the message of the film was one no one wanted to hear, but I applaud Willis for making it, and Fuqua for the film's honesty and integrity. If you pick up the Special Edition DVD, take the time to look at the special features and you will understand what I mean. The extras are from Africa, real people who have lived through the atrocities shown. Because of that, and perhaps because many of these fine actors were drawn in to the plight of the people, this film presents an authenticity seldom seen in a war film. The ""SEALs"" in the film were trained by Harry Humphries, a former SEAL and Vietnam Veteran, for two weeks to both fight and think like SEALs for the purposes of the film, and carried actual packs and gear during the filming. While Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci obviously head the cast, this is in every sense an ""ensemble"" cast and it shows. Cole Hauser, Nick Chinlund and the other members of the SEAL team never once break character, and present the personalities needed with a quiet elegance that you feel through the screen. One significant aspect of Fuqua's directing is clear, this is not a problem of race or location, but of decency. A problem that exists today. The recent attention to KONY has made that apparent, and President Obama has pledged to see to that problem. We shall see. Rated R for violence, atrocities, and language, this film is one for the adults in the house with a strong stomach.

And Bruce Willis can convincingly show us he can play the military tough-guy-with-a-heart role.This film is about a special army unit send in to Nigeria to rescue a doctor and some foreign missionaries from a military coup. The coup d'etat of the government and the country altogether, creates almost an anarchy of bloodshed in its wake, as innocents are savagely slain by military troops. Note for parents: some of the scenes are disturbing and there is much violence, with women and children brutally murdered. While this was difficult to watch, it added an enormous amount of credibility to the film, as I don't doubt for a second that such horrors go on in Africa. As Lt. Waters (Willis) escorts Dr. Kendricks (Bellucci) and some of her patients to Cameroon, they are unknowingly pursued by the Nigerian military who are on a search-and-destroy campaign for the only surviving heir to the throne.Bruce Willis, while often a bit too G.I. Joe at times, does don the military cap well. Bellucci gives a captivating performance as a woman who really cares for her patients and human life in general. Damn, I was convinced!

85,cashbacher,Not our fight morphs into a noble mission,10,3 April 2020,"This movie is a tear-jerker war action thriller where you feel for the helpless victims, the people being rescued and the American soldiers that are giving their all to protect them. The premise is a simple one, a female American doctor, a priest and two nuns run a health clinic in rural Nigeria. There has been a very violent coup and the forces of the new rulers are brutally killing all who are even remotely in opposition. That includes the people that run the clinic.
Bruce Willis plays A. K. Waters, the leader of a Navy SEAL team that is sent to the clinic in order to extract the four people. While his mission is very dangerous, it is straightforward. They need to find the people to be extracted, take them to the rendezvous point (LZ) and be helicoptered to safety aboard the home base aircraft carrier.
However, the mission is modified to include the locals that are capable of traveling on foot. The priest and the nuns refuse to leave. Their band travels through the jungle to the LZ and the military unit, the doctor and what locals can be loaded lift off. When they are in the air, they see the health clinic has been attacked and all people there killed. This leads Waters to order the helicopters back to the LZ, where they pick up 12 of the refugees and take them to the carrier.
While there is some intense war action and brutal treatment of villagers, there are also moments of tenderness between the soldiers and their rising determination to protect the locals, no matter the cost. There are scenes when an American soldier ruthlessly cuts the throat of an enemy and then expresses empathy towards the female villager being attacked. At first the relationship between the doctor and Waters is one of hostility, but over time she realizes that he and his men are people of integrity and that they are worthy of her respect.
This is a great action movie, for it shows many sides of the soldiers, their loyalty to each other and their willingness to put themselves at great risk in order to do what they believe is right.",Tears of the Sun
86,udeaasykle,"Not what i expected, in a positive way.",6,3 May 2004,"When i deceided to watch this movie i was expecting a typical american hero, we are good, everybody else is evil kind of movie. And although it kind of is that type of movie, it is much better then i thought. You get to see some of the horrors of war, children without their mothers, merciless killings and raping of innocent civilians. So it is not one of those thoughtless braindead action movies, this actually makes you think about war and just how meaningless it is. This will never be a classic or anything but it is a good movie to watch if you are bored and want something ok to watch. Bruce Willis does look mean and cool in this movie by the way:) I rate this movie 6/10",Tears of the Sun
87,TheEtherWalk,"Sappy, boring and derivative",4,13 August 2003,"I happen to be a big fan of war films, but I thought this was the worst one I've ever seen. Not only does it not kick nearly enough ass, the plot is overdramatic and even dull.The acting is good all around, except for Bruce Willis who might as well be a cardboard box with a gun. The plot of 'sacrificing many to save a few' has been done already in Saving Private Ryan, and here it doesn't even work.There are only 2 battle scenes in this movie. The first one is more of a massacre and the second one only lasts 15 minutes. Go figure. The ending was WAY too Hollywood, where we have the obligatory shot of the 'main bad guy' being killed while everyone else dies at the same time.
One of the worst things about this movie is the length. It is way too short to be a solid war film. I gave it a 6/10.",Tears of the Sun
88,brandon_lee420,Great portrayal of war!,7,30 January 2010,"War movies have never been my favorite genre because they are boring, too military (what do you expect from war), and the violence really does get tedious at times. But one war film did impress me......a lot. I am proud to have seen a film starring Bruce Willis, one of the greatest action heroes of all time (that is in films of course), and Monica Belluci, a French who starred in Brotherhood of the Wolf, so can I please call on stage: Tears Of The Sun. Antoine Fuqua has made some masterpieces, just see Training Day and Shooter if you don't believe me, and Tears of the Sun should definitely be added to that short, but impressive, list. The performances are really good and Bruce Willis made this film what it is now, which is a masterpiece, pardon my exaggeration, and Monica Belluci along side Tom Skerrit were hot,ah, the HOT relates to Monica to anyone who thinks I am gay. MMMMM! I am thinking about the great but unrealistic violence which added a flavor to this film. They are running and shooting at the same so how cannot one of them get hit by a thousand gunmen? Guess we will have to ask Einstein that! The action would have been down the drain IF it wasn't for the great story about survival. The film really does get emotional at times and you will pretty much have tears in you're eyes as you see the murderous acts of the human kind. It was so heartbreaking that it nearly had me cry. A warning to people who faint at gruesome scenes: please be seated on a couch!!!!!!!!!!!. The atmosphere made an impact and it really made a mark on this film because without the dark atmosphere the effect from this film would have been very low. I am giving to much praise to Tears of the sun but the disappointments of this film are just about to come up.Navy SEAL Lieutenant A.K. Waters and his elite squadron of tactical specialists are forced to choose between their duty and their humanity, between following orders by ignoring the conflict that surrounds them, or finding the courage to follow their conscience and protect a group of innocent refugees. When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks' cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters' team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country's previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs. Waters and his small band of soldiers must weigh the life of one man against their own and the refugees they feel obliged to protect. (Copied from IMDb)The biggest flaw in this film has to be a question of some sort. How can a group of soldiers defeat an entire army? It does question the point of the movie but, hey, enjoy it for what it is and always remember that no movie will be perfect, EVER! The ending can be predicted after thirty minutes into the film and you know that they are gonna live happily ever after, or do you? Everyone should at least watch this once and don't let the negative reviews change your mind. ONE of the best military thrillers of 2003. A must see film. 7/10 - Recommended!""Over and Out."" 30 January 2010.",Tears of the Sun
89,jackjack-2,Entertaining but unreal,4,6 February 2006,"If the viewer is not concerned about detail, it is an interesting movie but the plot often doesn't make sense. First, the Navy Seals are sent to rescue a woman doctor who is not an American but the wife of an American but obviously not living with her husband. Not likely. And the woman is supposed to be English but she looks about as English as a Mexican Indian.Next the Seals are briefed by the Captain of a major aircraft carrier (Tom Skerritt). If they were briefed it would have been by the Operations Officer who would not be a Captain. Later in the movie we see the Captain out on the busy flight deck talking to Bruce Willis on the radio. Never happen. When flights are being launched the Captain is on the bridge.The story goes on and on like this. And here comes a spoiler. When Willis and his Seal team and the doctor and the villagers begin their flight, the Nigerian army unit pursues them but doesn't find them in the dark in the jungle and passes by. But later viewers learn that one of the fleeing villagers has a homing device on him which the Nigerians are using to follow the villagers. So if the homing device was on, why couldn't the Nigerians find them in the dark? Then the fleeing Seal team comes upon Nigerian troops slaughtering the inhabitants in a village and the Seals intervene instead of by passing the village and kill all the Nigerians. Nice but stupid. The Seals are attempting to escape the Nigerians and the last thing they want to do is to provoke the Nigerian Army by killing its soldiers. Not only does it delay the escape of the Seals but it sets up a confrontation which eventually results in the deaths of several Seals.And the Seals, without any resupply, seem to have an endless amount of ammunition, just like the cowboys in the old Westerns used to have. In many ways this movie resembles the old cowboy movies of the 1930s and 40s with Bruce Willis substituting for John Wayne, Roy Rogers, and Gene Autry.The ending leaves too many questions open. Willis has willfully disobeyed his orders. Everyone in his unit is either killed or wounded and he has likely caused an international incident. Yet he gets on his horse, a helicopter, and flies off into the sunset. What the viewer doesn't know is whether he is disciplined or not. Other movies dealing with the same subject matter show that the hero get punished but we just don't know.But again if the viewer only wants to be entertained, it is an entertaining movie. Why it was rated R escapes me. There is a lot of violence but no sex or nudity, although the breasts of a black woman are shown while she is being raped. But given all the documentaries showing naked black women, that isn't enough to warrant an R rating. At best PG-13.",Tears of the Sun
90,edwardrevans,The Wild Geese,6,9 August 2006,"Not a bad film, even brutal in parts, sound was also poor (dialogue) and the movie itself plot wise was a tad too like the The Wild Geese for my liking. The end of the film in particular was also hard to follow the body count i.e that of the American soldiers and the ending also seemed rushed.My other point i didn't like a bout the film is I would have liked to know what happened to the two Nun's, we can guess (ok it may not be nice but its not like we are spared disturbing scenes elsewhere).I must agree also with the beard goof this also made it difficult to keep track of the characters.",Tears of the Sun
91,guyb,Excruciatingly irritating heroine,1,11 June 2003,"Monica Bellucci's character was one of the most irritating characters I've seen this year.  How an experienced MD living in the jungle could be this naive is beyond belief.  She whines and whines and puts the soldiers at extreme risk.  This was just not credible.  I can't imagine the soldiers would put up with this in real life.   I just kept wishing something would happen to take her out or my misery or someone would just hit her up-aside the head.   The priest and nuns were irritating too, but I guess this might really happen; there people can be real naive in real life as well as dedicated.  I think Bruce Willis had a real chance for a halfway decent movie and should have vetoed the casting.  They actually did a decent job at developing the other military characters, but it was destroyed by her character.",Tears of the Sun
92,GreyHunter,Mixed feelings,6,25 November 2019,"This is the very definition of a movie that mixes genuinely great moments with sappy, off-putting, and inauthentic ones.First the bad: from the start, we are presented with the very, very tired White Savior trope, with LT and Lena taking center stage and never once relinquishing it. Now, it's just as possible for white people to be the heroes as black people, no argument there. But there's always this nagging undercurrent of ""what are the black natives doing? (There are, of course, black SEALs, but they are effectively just extensions of LT for our purposes here.) When you set a movie in sub-Saharan Africa and the most prominent black person is a royal prince who does nothing more than lead to disaster after disaster with no other notable usefulness to the mission to save the refugees, it's almost impossible not to think of the White Savior cliche. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie, but it certainly brings up the issue of pandering to the primary audience. The fawning over LT and Lena by the only other notable African in the group, Patience, just grates in this light.Now, the relationship between LT and Rhodes seemed to have been written by someone who spent some time in the Salvation Army rather than a professional military. A lieutenant (a nearly 50 year old lieutenant to boot, which raises serious questions about LT's competency if he hasn't made it past lieutenant by 50) altering his mission for any reason other than dire need is...no...going...to...fare...well. Rhodes should -- and in the real world, absolutely would -- rain down hell on LT for doing what he did. He would obviously support them -- they're still U.S. military, after all -- but he would never have just rolled over after a few words for LT. And he certainly would have been beside himself at the end. As we learned in the Blackhawk Down incident, Americans and American politicians do not take well to losing soldiers in isolated incidents in undeclared wars/police actions where the entire military isn't committed to the fight. World War 2? Sure. That's war. Extraction missions in a country neither the U.S. nor the U.N. have gotten officially invested in? Not a chance, and Rhodes would have known that. A realistic sequel to this movie would have LT in cuffs and facing a court martial as soon as he left the hospital.Now a couple good things: the cinematography and establishment of mood were excellent. The movie really revealed a world of beauty and horror, of primitive rainforest and dirt and muddy conditions that are far more realistic than most movies about people going through primeval areas. And, attendant to that, the scene in the destroyed village half-way through was incredibly well-done. It didn't sanitize a thing. It was a scene of brutality that didn't come across as voyeurism, of man's inhumanity to man that didn't (mostly) seem preachy or derivative. It showed a realistic (well, supermen taking out every enemy with a single shot wasn't exactly realistic, granted) expression of the horror these supposedly hardened soldiers felt upon witnessing what had happened and continued to happen as they moved through the village. It was an amazing scene to rival any to be found in movies about military and war. Had the entire move adhered to this unflinching, grimy portrayal of the realities of war, I feel no reticence in saying it would likely be considered a modern masterpiece. Unfortunately it didn't.As I said in the title, I have mixed feelings about this movie. Other than some cliched melodrama and some clearly uninformed ideas about how the real world works, it was generally a pretty good movie. Its main flaw was that Hollywood screenwriters didn't do their research well enough to avoid the stuff mentioned above. I'm going with 6.5 rounded up to 7 because it did manage to avoid some of the triteness of this sort of cinematic fare and the scene in the village was magnificent. Not perfect, but definitely getting there.",Tears of the Sun
93,mrskywalker,Brilliant,10,6 April 2003,"This is one of the greatest war movies ever made.  It is better than Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor.  It is not that it is an epic but it catches the best and the worst of the human race that comes out in war.  Another writer says it tries to be noble.  No it is noble.  But tears also shows the dark side in a big way too.  It is also so timely because it relates so well to the current war in which cruel tyrants are so vicious to people like Iraqi leadership is.  it has a real point but not an agenda.  It is not politically correct at all which probably hurt its reviews.  This is a fine film with great but hard action and brutal but it fits the story.  I would like to see young people like teenagers see the film with a little of the worst violence cut out perhaps by a parent who has seen it instead of watching total garbage like American Pie or Dream Catcher.  The world is not exactly as certain media and schools portray it. This film is so revealing.It is a story of oppression from warlords in Africa and the plight of refugees and American special forces get involved to rescue a few American missionaries.  (Rwanda ethnic cleansing a few years ago gives you an idea of the situation)  These things are still going on in Africa and many other places like Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Middle East and Columbia.  In this film decisions must be made which increase the tension of the film.  The final  battles are memorable.  Bruce Willis is at the top of his game here.

94,mrskywalker,Life Changing Event,10,6 April 2003,"This film had a larger effect on me than any other.  It made me realize that we can not bury our heads in the sand while the worst atrocities are occurring.  Unfortunately, left wing socialist types, certain false artsy types, the kind of minorities that believe peacemakers are uncle toms, and sheltered spoiled americans, and kid who have been raised on tolerance indoctrination and African masks, all have to look in the mirror when they see this film and realize that there is a large world out there in which people are fighting for survival when politically correct types in the U.S. and Europe think such things as gender neutral language is a major world issue.Thank God for this film.  The world is not about race or gender or proper language.  Some films congratulate themselves because they believe they have pushed the envelope by showing someone wash there teeth or get sick which is pointless and goofy realism.  This film goes to the largest issues of mankind.  It can be a life and death struggle for survival for millions with incredible challenges.

95,Amthermandes,Ignore the haters,8,2 April 2019,"""Tears of the Sun"" is a thrilling, emotional ride based on real events. The film is not without flaws. There are a few character flaws, questionable character decisions, minor errors in editing and sound, and there could be one or two issues with historical accuracy, but this is a movie, not a documentary. And they do a great job telling a story about how humanity can be at its worst, as well as at its best, and that good always triumphs over evil. It's got more feel to it than most standard Hollywood action films, and while there is action, there is also drama, war horror, and emotions. It is not one to dismiss, nor be ridiculed. It feels honest, and is an entertaining, as well as though-provoking movie.Now I will add my counter-arguments to some of the most common negative reviewers:
""Typical Hollywood narrative""While many Hollywood films have proven in the past to have made MANY mistakes in story-writing, one thing they are effective in doing is using data of all sorts that help generate formulas that in turn create effective stories that are received as positively as possible, and that will generate the most profit, while maintaining numerous other variables. In short, if a generic plot formula works, no point in not using it.
It is presumptuous when people attack the story of a Hollywood movie, by claiming it to be a dull, and stale cliche. Because you can usually find other movies that have received outstanding reviews and overwhelming praise that follow similar, if not close-to-exact, plot structure. Take ""Saving Private Ryan"" for example. There are several plot elements in that movie that are nearly identical to this movie, yet I guarantee many negative reviewers of ""Tears of the Sun"" have given glowing reviews to ""Saving Private Ryan."" This hypocrisy is not relevant to all, or possibly even most of those who gave a harsh critique to this film's plot, but it definitely applies to some.-""The Americans have to be the heroes yet again""
Why not? Americans have been heroes many times in real history. What's so wrong about the nation that creates movies, whether basing them on real events or not, to depict the protagonists as heroes with that nation's origin? EVERY country that generates movies does this. There is nothing wrong with a nation's pride being a focal point in cinema, as long as it's in good taste.
Additionally, yes this film is based on a Canadian task force. But the actual events in the story is fictional (events of the direct story = fictional, events of the surrounding story = non-fictional), so there's no problem creating a fictional task force that's American, during a historical conflict.-""A handful of soldiers cannot overtake a whole army""
This is an easy one to counter. Let's list how many ways a small American squad can handle a small army:
1. Training. The Navy SEALs had far more extensive training, and knew how to operate well as a small group, which is easier to control and engage with than an army. Selection is also a point here. Only the best can be Navy SEALs, and I'm sure the rebels added anyone who supported their cause to their ranks.
2. Technology & gear. The SEALs had it all, the rebels had AK47s and blades. The SEALs had communication equipment that kept them all operating simultaneously and with minimal effort. Their weapons were well maintained, and thus more accurate, while the rebels no doubt did not take nearly as good care of theirs, which would result in much less effective firepower (and AK47s are already a fairly inaccurate rifle, which were the most common rifles used by the rebels). And don't forget, they had some help in the end.
3. Willpower. After seeing what the rebels are capable of, the American soldiers, along with the Ibo people, had more to fight for. That can make, and has made, a difference.
4. History. There are MANY accounts of a small group of people, even sole individuals, who have stood their ground against many hostiles. In some of these true and confirmed events, those heroes who stood their ground also came out alive. In all of them, they were heavily outnumbered. A few examples are: July 18, 1918 where 5 American soldiers held against more than 60 Germans, killing 22 and capturing 40, . Thus, based on history alone, the efforts of the SEALs depicted in ""Tears of the Sun"" could be justified.",Tears of the Sun
96,AzSumTuk,I just couldn't finish this...,4,6 March 2016,"OK, before I continue with the actual review, I want to make one thing clear - I believe Antoine Fuqua is among the best action profiled film directors ever. The man is a real master of the genre, being able to do a Die Hard type of an action film just as easily as he is able to adopt John Woo's style when he needs to. And 'Tears of the Sun' is yet another proof of that - the action scenes are nicely staged, the visuals are very good, the pacing is fine...And, still, I just couldn't finish it? Well, first, there is the acting - while Bruce Willis is as great as he always is, Monica Belluci is just horrible. Honestly, I think this woman only has a career because of her looks and for no other reason. (Or may be she is better when she isn't acting in English. I have seen some French speaking roles of hers and I didn't hate her.) There is no doubt that she is incredibly beautiful, but her role here requires more than beauty - to be blunt, when you are supposed to be an incredibly talented doctor, shoving your breasts in the viewers' eyes just can't cut it. Not when the movie is so serious in tone - and 'Tears of the Sun' is dead serious.Which leads me to the next problem of this movie - the writing. Normally I wouldn't comment on a movie's writing if I haven't seen it in its entirety, but this time I just have to - because it is horrible. The tone is, as I said, dead serious, but, at the same time, the main characters are just... Well, they are the Expendables - a bunch of indestructible warriors, capable of killing hundreds of enemies, they will save the day, they will save the world, they will save the beautiful doctor with the big breasts and they will do it for America!!! And there would be no problem with that if the movie was a comedy like 'The Expendables'. But when the filmmakers are trying to actually convey a message... Well, it doesn't ring true, to say the least.And I wanted to like this movie.",Tears of the Sun

98,wastebot,"With a few exceptions, a typical war hero film",5,16 March 2003,"With one scene, the movie went from something potentially significant to typical war action dribble.That said, it is something to watch.  The plot seems contrived, but the story and action once the movie is rolling keep you involved.  The FX are impressive and it rarely holds back on the display of the pain and brutality of racial/religious conflicts.",Tears of the Sun
99,RolloTomasi,"So, why Nigeria?",6,11 March 2003,"The makers of `Tears of the Sun,' blindfolded, maybe just pointed at a list of African nations in which ethnic cleansing has taken place and landed on Nigeria? Actually Nigeria is as good a country to pick on as any. Rwanda, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe are some other nations they had to choose from. Clearly the makers of `Tears' wanted it to take place in Africa, for noble reasons I'm sure. Hollywood has long ignored the tribal warfare and military horrors of many of its nations.But I wondered how close what happened in the film is to modern conditions in Nigeria. I thought there had to be a reason they picked it. For one, I think they wanted a jungle nation. That eliminates Ethiopia and Sudan, which are eastern, high and dry nations. As for Rwanda (also not a jungle nation), the U.S. presence there in 1994 is still a source of controversy, with questions about the degree of our involvement or lack of it. Also much of that catastrophe was aired on newscasts throughout the world. It's safe to say that the film's makers, understandably, simply wanted nothing to do with that nation. Then there's Nigeria. What takes place in `Tears,"" the source of the religion-fueled ethnic cleansing depicted, is a military coup d'etat. The truth? A civilian government exists there today, although parts of Nigeria regularly experience localized civil unrest and violence, including in the country's largest city, Lagos. Clearly what takes place in `Tears,' though, at least the events of the coup itself, are modeled after Rwanda.
The choice to use a real nation is curious indeed. To not do so would seem to indict all of Africa in the minds of those with a narrow world view (surely a good portion of the film's potential audience). I guarantee the film will be the ONLY education many people who see the film will get on that country. It's as if the film's makers are saying, 'Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda--one's as bad as another so it doesn't matter which we use.' As I said at the beginning, if any nation deserves to be picked on in this way, Nigeria fits the bill. The problem is that the reasons behind genocide, in any nation in which it takes place, are much more complex than Muslims (easy targets these days) killing Christians. In the film, the only body commiting murder in the film are the soldiers. In Nigeria's history, the violence has been largely tribes warring with each other, with the military getting involved and sometimes, according to whom you ask, taking sides. What's happening in the film is basically a very one-sided civil war, which is accurate--but more times than not, it's tribe versus tribe that produces the mass killings. By necessity, the filmmakers must take an overly simplistic view of Nigeria's history of unrest. The film tells of a royal family, democratically elected to office, being assassinated. This, as far as I can see from some researching the subject, never happened in Nigeria. Military dictators were overthrown by other military men, and sometimes the outgoing leader was assassinated. Nothing in the scope of the events told in ""Tears,"" though, ever took place. In fact, Nigeria's current president is a civilian, Olusegun Obasanjo, who was the country's dictator from 1976 to 1979, was replaced by a civilian, then jailed during the administration of Sani Abacha (who ruled from 1993 until dying of a heart attack in 1998). Obasanjo was freed by Abacha's successor, Abdulsalam Abubakar, in 1998. Abubakar, like Obasanjo in his time, transitioned the country to democracy. Obasanjo ran in the elections of 1999 and won.What eats me about `Tears of the Sun' and other war films like it (`Behind Enemy Lines' comes to mind) is that just once I'd like to feel like I'm not watching an Army propaganda film.  Even `Black Hawk Down' had a certain war hawk-lean to it. This is certainly due to the fact that cooperation with US Armed Forces is vital to the production of these films. Agreements are made-certain lines are not to be crossed, certain information not divulged. But a piece like `Tears' not only doesn't cross the line, it comes off like a navy SEAL training video. A scenario like that told of in `Tears' deserves better than the macho fronting, the just doing my job, ma'am' excuses for inexcusable behavior. Surely audiences deserve a better explanation for ethnic cleansing than it is what they do,' as if the Nigerian woman has no idea why the Nigerian soldiers would commit such atrocities. If you're not willing to answer the question yourself, then don't ask it.
I'm sure `Tears of the Sun' is supposed to be about how humanity is impossible to suppress, even for the most hardened soldier. It's hard to believe they would stand and watch the ethnic cleansing take place for even the short time they do before acting. From where I sat, there seemed to be no choice at all. The only thing to decide is how to stop it.  See `No Man's Land' for a better picture of how it's impossible to get in the middle of a conflict and stay neutral.",Tears of the Sun
100,timothyhilditch,American propaganda fictionizing history,1,6 November 2021,"This movie is set during a fictional Nigerian civil war in the early 2000's. Let me repeat fictional, a genocide is taking place, which didn't happen in the actual civil war in the 60s. Bruce Willis leads a team of Navy Seals to rescue an American trapped in southern Nigeria. He is totally portrayed as a white saviour coming to save Africa all by himself and no one else. This same plot is mirrored in the famous Chinese propaganda movie Wolf Warrior 2, but at least this movie is less racist. Bruce Willis' character saves a village which was being genocided, but a few scenes later he orders a refugee to be shot while running away. This movie takes the Nigerian civil war and rewrites it to include a genocide and Americans invading to save the people.

104,Jona1988,Good war movie with attempts at a moral theme,6,17 October 2010,"Tears of the sun feels like a film that tries to be both an thrilling war experience and on the other hand give a thought about the moral aspects. It actually pulls this of quite alright. The war scenes a really well done, delivering a really nasty representation. The tone is sad right off from the beginning, a feeling of hopelessness very well achieved. Bruce Willis plays the character he does in most of his action films, he is John McClane even though he isn't called that here. The other characters are also pretty good. After a while one actually manages to recognise the other soldiers in the team some by name, which states that this is not just some dumb action without an ounce of character development. The second main role, well played by Monica Bellucci. She feels a bit irritating in the beginning but the viewers warm to her just like Bruce Willis character, almost impressive. The action is very well made, gritty and keeps good suspense. Sometimes it gets somewhat hard to follow when it they cut quick and many soldiers look alike. But that it is a bit chaotic works well to strengthen the feeling that it shows how war is. However the shooting and fighting doesn't have such a dominating roll as could be expected. This is where the moral comes in. They attempt to give a thought about how people come to be affected by war, both the civilians as usual but in this film especially the soldiers. Bruce Willis though, emotionless lieutenant is not left indifferent to the horror even if he tries. The parts that focus on emotion works surprisingly well, it could have got just awkward but it doesn't. Still there are flaws in the film . Some clichés as expected, the heroes turn out to be close to pure good and the bad guys are the evilness in human form. There is a twist in the plot which I felt was so silly I hadn't seen it coming. The ending gets way to long and drawn-out which was not at all necessary. And if you are expecting a cool massive action adventure aka Rambo you might be disappointed because this is not that kind of film. To summarize, I was overall satisfied with Tears of the sun. There are things that could be better but the flaws are not to the level where it becomes to annoying. Better than I had thought it would be. 6/10",Tears of the Sun

106,Finntroll,A big waste.,3,20 June 2004,"Bruce Willis career seems to spiral downwards. I honestly can't remember which was his last good movie, but it sure wasn't this one.Bruce Willis and a gang of goons are set out to rescue people in Nigeria from evil Muslim fundamentalists. As you may suspect things don't turn out as they should. The plot of this movie is up to date in a really cynical way, the makers want to make money out of the western world's big fear of Muslims. The symbolism manages to be both racist and over the top as the Muslims are portrayed as pure evil people who kill children and women and even destroy a Christian convent. The rest of the movie is a predictable and boring 2 hour march. The only redeeming things were Bruce Willis, who still can act, and the occasionally amusing war scenes. A particularly useless ending gives this movie the big kiss of death.You only live once. Don't spend time nor money on this.",Tears of the Sun
107,elu5iv3,"Raw emotion, a great movie",8,22 August 2003,"Tears of the Sun: 7.5/10The big surprise of the year so far for me, after seeing the 6.1/10 average rating at IMDB. Bruce Willis plays a Special-Ops commander who leads his team into the jungle of Nigeria to rescue Dr. Kendricks played by Monica Belluci, who will only go with them if they agree to rescue 70 refugees too. So Willis allows them to trek along, and they almost get caught by the rebels. The choppers arrive, and Willis' squadron do a pseudo-double cross, where they force Kendricks on to the plane (as that was their order, to get her out, and not bother with the situation in Nigeria), and leave the poor refugees behind. On the way, you can see Willis' conscience knawing at him, and he acts it out very well. He orders the choppers to turn back, and they do. 28 of the weakest/slowest refugees are put on the choppers and led to safety, leaving Willis' squadron and other refugees alone, having to trek to Cameroon. This leads into a wildly intense, thrilling, and at times disturbing movie. I rarely get emotional watching movies, but I was on the verge of tears more than once during this flick. Without giving too much away, the horror of war in Nigeria, and the ""ethnic cleansing"" of the rebel army (which is shown in it's brutal honesty) is depicted. The last sequence of the movie, race to the border, is absolutely breathtaking. The very last scene of the movie is enough to bring someone to tears. I would really recommend this, and can't understand why ratings aren't higher. Sure, it's not ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it's a damn good stand-alone movie.",Tears of the Sun
108,Vishal_s_kumar,God already left Africa,8,28 October 2009,"It's an old adage but it generally holds true, and Tears of the Sun is its defining movie. It says that the best War movies don't glorify combat but instead frame it in a deeper context, depicting not only the horrors of combat but digging into the souls of those thrust into its jaws, forced to discover who they are, what they are made of, and examine their core values in the face of danger, conflicting orders from superiors, and a conscience that must struggle with right and wrong, the chain of command, and the moral compass that guides every soul. Indeed, Tears of the Sun, by that definition, is the quintessential War picture. Though not depicting the events of a declared War or recognized conflict from a U.S. perspective, Tears of the Sun does focus on the War that rages within a man's soul when faced with the atrocities of genocide and the moral quagmire of going against everything that's ingrained into a soldier's conscience and instead looking deep into his own heart and the eyes of those suffering needlessly at the hands of those that derive pleasure from pain and choosing a course of action that may not follow the strict guidelines laid out in the briefing room but does reflect what is not only good, but right.The African nation of Nigeria is in a state of upheaval. A rebel faction has murdered the Presidential family and is rampaging through the nation, brutally slaughtering anyone with differing ideologies. With an American-by-marriage relief worker, Dr. Kendricks (Monica Bellucci), and several others Westerners in immediate danger, a Navy SEAL team, led by Lieutenant A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis), is tasked with retrieving them and escorting them to safety where they will be retrieved via helicopter and returned home. Waters and his team find Kendricks easily enough but matters are complicated when she refuses to leave behind the refugees, many of whom are wounded and ill. Eventually, the SEAL team becomes witness first-hand to the genocide that plagues the nation. In direct violation of their orders, the team decides to escort both Kendrick and the band of refugees to the safety of the Cameroon border, but must contend with a heavily-armed contingent of Nigerian rebels hot on their trail.As alluded to earlier, there is a difference between a ""War"" picture and an ""Action"" picture. Tears of the Sun goes several steps further than garden-variety ""Action"" pictures such as the admittedly fun but none-too-intelligent run-and-gun Action flick. Tears doesn't gloss over reality, make action entertaining, or ignore the impact of the human condition in modern combat. While there is definitely a place in cinema for fare like Navy Seals, Tears of the Sun drives home its point with a sincerity and professionalism that allows it to rise through the ranks of more standard-fare cinema and into the realm of emotionally significant pictures that also deliver several wonderfully-realized action sequences that prove more engaging than many others found in lesser films thanks to Director Antoine Fuqua's insistence that they take on a far more realistic tone than those found in less authentic pictures. The violence in Tears of the Sun is unforgiving; it's hard to swallow and may upset some viewers in its depiction of genocide and modern warfare, but it serves the crucial purpose of reinforcing the soldiers' decision to face it head-on rather than ignore the brutality that they've become witness to.An emotionally draining but certainly important slice of cinema for its depiction of the strength of the human soul and the courage to face the worst in the name of what's right rather than what's easy and convenient, Tears of the Sun is an unmitigated success, but Director Antoine Fuqua and the film's cast inject even more into the picture to round it into a complete experience. Fuqua is one of the best in the business and perhaps one of cinema's most under-appreciated Directors; second only to Training Day in terms of technical proficiency, Tears of the Sun is not only wonderfully shot but it captures early on a mood of fear, uneasiness, and danger, and the picture never relents. A palpable tension hangs over the film, not necessarily that the inevitable and deadly firefight will come, but instead in relation to the well-being of the people, both soldier and civilian alike. Though many of the faces are mere background characters, it's impossible not to become emotionally involved with every member of the party rather than just those with speaking lines or extra face time. Fuqua captures the despair and danger with much skill; while the movie's intended message and the emotional response it aims for are obvious, neither ever comes across as contrived or forced. Finally, Bruce Willis, Cole Hauser, Eamonn Walker (""Oz""), and the rest of the SEALs all deliver performances that not only reflect the skill and professionalism of America's elite fighting unit, but they balance that with a heartfelt emotion that, perhaps more than any other factor in the film, sells its message of strength, courage, and morality no matter the situation or the odds.",Tears of the Sun

It was really hard to keep from crying so bring your Kleenex. This appeared to be a realistic portrayal of some of the fighting that is happening in Africa. The movie took place in Nigeria but if you read about the fighting currently going on in Congo, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, and Liberia it's kind of a reality check of all the brutality going on by rebels. Bruce Willis plays a Navy Seal Lt. A.K. Waters instructed to rescue an American Doctor-Lena Kendricks-a priest and a nun from a refugee camp in Nigeria, played by Monica Bellucci.  She has grown close to many of these refugees and has seen alot of killings and brutality and wants to try and save them from death.  Waters arrives at the camp with some fellow Seals and tells the DR he has orders she must go with him however she refuses to leave her refugees behind. Waters then tells her she can bring them but they must leave the camp immediately because the rebels are on their way and will surely kill everybody. The priest and nun still refuse to go. They start on a long, tiring journey until they get to a US helicopter that is going to being them to safety in Cameroon. When Lena discovers he had no intention of taking the refugees with them on board the chopper she refuses to board, so he grabs her and throws her on the chopper, leaving all the refugees behind to suffer whatever fate meets them. She is absolutely devastated and hysterical at his betrayal. When they fly over the camp they were rescued from, Waters sees blood and bodies everywhere, has a change of heart and goes back to meet up the refugees. There is not enough room for everyone on the chopper so they start a long journey on foot with rebels hot on their trail. Waters later learns there is a ""rat"" in their group giving away their location to the rebels who are rapidly getting closer to their location.  It's a constant cat and mouse game trying to avoid a rebel army packed with 300 soldiers, vastly outnumbering the SEALS.

It was simply astonishing how ignorant and delusional the doctor was. Frankly it was very sexist how utterly and completely stupid they made her. There is just simply no way she would have been so out of touch with reality. They rebels were advancing to kill anyone in their path, especially foreigners. The Navy Seals arrived to take her and the nuns to safety. How in the world is she mad that they can't take other people?? How is she so stupid not to understand that very simple situation?? The entire movie should've been 15 minutes, seriously, they should have pulled up asked her if she wanted to leave when she said ""no not without my people"" they should've turned and left. The fact that it was any longer and included the rest of this hot garbage is frankly hilarious. How are the filmmakers so stupid to think that we are so ignorant that we will except this movie as is and not cry foul to the ridiculousness of it?? How on earth does Bruce Willis's character turn around and sacrifice the entire mission just to save some villagers?? All life is precious but he had a very simple and direct task and he disobeyed orders and jeopardized the entire mission and the lives of brave American soldiers for literally nothing. In real life he would've been court-martialed and probably sent to jail for at least 20 years for what he did. This entire movie was simply horrible and I did not even finish it. I am so angry for the amount of time that I wasted watching this ridiculous and Ludacris movie. It was an insult to viewers, it was a devastating blow for the actors careers and it was an embarrassment to portray American soldiers in this way.

113,drunken_critic,Political thought,7,21 November 2003,"This movie stimulated political thought.  If you do not want to hear political rhetoric, please skip this review. It's about time that a movie identifies the brutal truth of oppression that occurs because of a religion. I know it is EXTREMELY politically incorrect. But it's about time that all free thinkers question oppression that occurs in the name of religion.  Years ago, the world did not have trouble identifying Communism as `bad', because of the mass genocide that occurred in countries such as Poland, Russia, and Cambodia.  Movies often portrayed Communism as `bad'.    I don't see why religion that causes the same atrocity should be excused. I would love to see more movies that address the oppression caused by all religions, Whether it is Christian, Jew, or Muslim. This movie quietly does this.  It is not announced that this is a religious war.  I believe one quote was `they are killing because they go to another church'.This movie has it all murder, rape, genocide, ethnic cleansing, religious war.  It was pretty scary.  It reminds me that I could live in some third world country fearing all of the above.  Living in some third world countries is like living among the seven horsemen of the apocalypse.  The movie takes place in Nigeria, loosely based on fact.  A religious war is taking place between the Christians and Muslims.  This is the first movie I can remember where the Muslim run government is represented as evil. Which brings me to a point.  Is there any conflict currently in the world that does not involve Muslims?  Muslims vs. Hindus, Muslims vs. Jews, Muslims vs. Christians, Muslims vs. infidels.  I am glad that a movie touches on a politically incorrect issue, (religion).  The Muslim religion is directly involved in the majority if not all of the conflict in the world.  Maybe its time we question why.  Mass genocide often happens in these third world countries undetected.  Often only discovered later by uncovering shallow graves filled with 100's of bodies of the political dissidents.  It's about time a movie touch on war based on religion.  I don't want to come across as anti-Muslim.  I am sure that true interpretation of the Koran in theory should bring love and understanding, but it hard to implement in a government based form, (just like it was hard to implement the communist manifesto in a government form freely and not by force).7.5/10",Tears of the Sun

122,gravity3,Moving story highlights Strong Willis Performance,8,22 December 2005,"Director Antoine Fuqua came to my attention upon seeing THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS (which I mainly saw because John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat were involved). Mira Sorvino had just won her Oscar, and as is now commonplace, chose an action picture as a follow-up. Fuqua's directing style greatly impressed me, and I haven't been disappointed in anything from him since (including BAIT, starring a yet-to-be-Oscar-material Jamie Foxx, and TRAINING DAY, which won a Best Actor Oscar for Denzel Washington's chilling performance). It's clear he knows how to direct his leads.That couldn't be more true with TEARS OF THE SUN. Willis and crew are convincing (even when the story is not) as individuals making tough choices about trust in life-and-death situations. Willis gives us a war-torn, aging soldier; confident enough to lead his men, yet struggling with choices he himself doesn't fully understand. It's not a completely realistic character (no one in his position and with his training would really buck orders as he does here - BLACK HAWK DOWN certainly handles this overly abused dynamic with more realism). Willis breathes conviction into it nonetheless, forcing my suspension of disbelief.Even when Monica Bellucci gets a little too annoying in her pacifistic obliviousness (hard to believe given her location and past experiences), insisting on resting the patients when enemy soldiers are bearing down on their position, Willis makes interesting character choices that motivated my interest. His delivery is thoughtful, even when the dialog is not. He is much more of the puzzle we're trying to decipher here than the plot, which is surprisingly simple. I think he's still underrated as an actor, and feel this is perhaps his best performance since 12 MONKEYS.Director Fuqua also gives us the emotional backdrop of a modern war-torn West Africa in his story, and pushes it to the forefront of many scenes, to make his message clear without becoming preachy. It's a difficult balance to achieve, but I felt he pulled it off here nicely. He paints a brutal and relentless landscape that feels pulled right out of the headlines, and in doing so makes us overlook the shortcomings of the story with a harsh, gritty real-world scenario.Ultimately, TEARS OF THE SUN is a movie greater than the sum of its parts. If you break it all down, it doesn't look like much, and the typical Hollywood elements of the story certainly don't help that. But taken in the moment, with all that Willis and the cast bring to it, and Fuqua's clever direction, we have something much more engaging than one might expect at first glance. Top this off with another strong Hans Zimmer score, and you have something which is at the least entertaining if not consistent; and in the best of moments, emotionally immersing and impacting.

Yeah, we all know that movie like this is gonna go down with almost every character being a made-to-die kind of mannerism. But the intelligent characterization in this movie is none of the actors seemed to be too baffled with the problems and as the movie paces on, they accept a mission just for the order from mission leader and later get to grip on whats happening around in that place.This makes you feel so brutal, a Holocaust even in a mellowed down version will still look painful and the actors feel it. They are no way related to whats happening, they were in for a quick extraction mission but still when people are slaughtered they move from their Robot mindset to a more human perception, that right there will make you feel involved in the movie as much as the actors.The movie starts off very swiftly, and i was sure movies such as that will end in a rush, and it did. That's why i believe movie should take its time to pace in (Saving private Ryan, Black Hawk down, Hurt Locker) and then we might have a very surreal experience. I guess the director decided to end it just because he ran out of options, which is a bit cheesy.Monica bellucci should stick to modeling, i guess this part was one of her better ones, but still flat acting throughout, which is a let down.

There's a vibrancy there, a hyper quality, a colorfulness and tumultuous, that leaks through even in this grim film.Plus the smartness, the speed of thinking and talking, I've seen as much brilliance suddenly flash out as from any group in the world. Very open minds. There is a hint of that here as well.I saw violence in numerous countries too, including Nigeria (a president gunned down just 5 minutes from our house), Liberia, Kenya, and all over Sudan; but I know so much of it has its roots in colonial days, poor boundaries, the satanic divide and rule, terrible economies when Independence (often forcibly) arrived.The movie's narative here is quite a stretch. Nigeria's national government has been dominated by moslem northerners in recent years. Plus the US actively stayed out despite much criticism during the horrific late-60s Biafran war - approximately in this same area - with maybe 100,00 military deaths and 2 million dead from starvation.But the military tactics in the movie get praise for authenticity from most of those reviewers here from that background. The Hawaiian sets absolutely capture the landscape at Nigeria's south-east and the mountains of western Cameroun.The population absolutely would look like that, the actors seem to have come from just there, they had the west African coastal look.And the compassionate trusting enveloping ""chemistry"" which flows from the locals to the nurse to the military - I have often felt that getting to me.",Tears of the Sun

The only thing that warrants the score of 6/10 is the acting by Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci who both deliver solid performances and the cinematography with some great aerial shots of forests and exotic nature. An experienced director such as Antoine Fuqua should've made more of this story. He knows how to draw attention to his actors and focus on the important plot points.

I liked that ""realistic"" portions of the movie.  The training, the equipment, the inclusion of natives as the cast members.  Some of which actually survived through similar circumstances and whose memories were incorporated into parts of the film.What I didn't like was the main character played by Willis.  He was originally portrayed as being hard and ""by the book"" as well as a loner. They tried too hard to get this message across while at the same time having him being shown as instantly fascinated by Lena.  He was making all these contradictory choices and decisions early on in the movie seemingly based on nothing more than his attraction towards the good doctor.  The word ""whipped"" kept creeping into my head.  His was the weak character in the film and it almost wrecked the entire movie.I won't say to completely stay away, but I also don't know where this film belongs.  It's like a ugly hybrid of Black Hawke Down and Proof of Life.",Tears of the Sun
132,damien-16,Africa lies beyond Eboli,5,12 December 2004,"Francesco Rosi has made ""God has stopped at Eboli"". Indeed God may well have. Several people commenting on Tears of the sun mention Burke's quote on evil triumphing if good men do nothing. But to me the most memorable, and most poignant, quote is Willis reply: "" God has left Africa a long time ago"". I have worked in Africa for 17 years. I can fully understand the sentiment expressed in this reply. I do not want to give up hope, and I have spent some memorably good moments there, but I cannot but help thinking more often than not that Africa has become a basket case. Some of the reasons for this are hinted at in the movie: greed, by the west hungry for oil and minerals and by the corrupted local officials, tribalism, which may be linked to religion although in my experience the tribe comes first, and especially the use of tribalism to foster greed, as in this film.The carnage shown at the mission and at the village are gripping illustrations of something that has been happening in Africa for ages and certainly will continue for many more years. I can believe the movie is honest in trying to kick us a conscience with these images. They certainly are very powerful. But this honorable intention is marred by 2 things. One: it is packaged into a very mediocre action movie, woodenly acted, with a script full of holes and an unbelievable, but it is Hollywood after all, ending. Two: it is too topical. We are not looking at a universal conflict, the two tribes are not archetypal for THE tribes, no, they are specifically named: Fulani and Ibo in Nigeria, and suggesting the Fulani are monsters and the Ibo innocent slaughtering sheep. Not so. It could easily be the other way around. By giving these very specific topical references, the film compromises severely whatever universal message it might want to make. And presenting the son of a tribal chief as a hero for democracy is delusional.Related to the topicality: if your film is supposed to take place in south-west Nigeria, the landscape should look the part. I did not believe for one moment that we were in Nigeria. I liked the music, but if it was supposed to bring a sense of Nigeriality across, it failed to do so. On the other hand, it gave a sense of Africa, and as such the music came much closer to illustrate the universality of the movie than did the story.Still related to topicality but in a different sense: the character of the doctor played by Monica Belluci was very unbelievable, especially if you consider that her husband was killed not that long ago in a similar situation in Sierra Leone. I could easily recognize the priest and the nuns and their desire to stay. I talked to many missionaries who survived the massacres in the Congo in the sixties. What we see in the film comes over as quite realistic. But why does Dr Lena behave the way she does? What is her motivation? How is it possible that she is always yelling: ""MY people"" as she is only there since a short time and doesn't even speak the language? Psychologically she is totally underdeveloped, and that brings us back to the first problem point.",Tears of the Sun
133,Trajanc,"A passable action film, though some may dislike its politics.",6,8 March 2003,"This movie boasts solid directing, editing and cinematography. The performances are good enough considering the rather limited depth offered by the screenplay. The movie starts out looking like it might offer some serious and maybe interesting character clashes but in the end it all comes down to bullets, bullets and more bullets. That's not entirely bad since the gunfights are staged fairly well. I initially thought some of the tactics used by the SEALs (like walking quickly forward while shooting into an enemy position) were unrealistic but I checked and that's actually a bona fide method of assault in certain circumstances. Oh well.Some folks might object to this film and other American-produced African war movies chronic depiction of white people shooting loads of black people. If you are really pc that might be an issue for ya. Also the movie does seem to be a strong supporter of both the US military and a perceived need for the US to intervene in the affairs of other nations for the good of all. That might cause ya to choke but that's up to individual ideology. Others might get off on it's lauding of US soldiers. I go with the idea that you judge how well made a film is and what you think of it's politics completely seperately if you can.

134,DarkLugia1969,A Bruce Willis Disappointment,7,21 March 2003,"The movie entitled ""Tears of the Sun"" that I saw today was a letdown for me being a big Bruce Willis fan.  Maybe it was due to so many moments of down time instead of the usual ""yip-pee-tai-yah"" action that is associated with Bruce Willis to make him one of the best action actors of the last century and for this century.The good things that I can say for this film is that the character of Bruce Willis had to make several difficult choices which was very difficult for him being a naval officer.  He was force to disobey a lawful order from a superior officer due to what Willis witness as he and his troops saw several Africans butchered by rebel soldiers.  Now, I have been in the military for many years, realistically speaking, Willis would be court martialed and  be sent to Fort Leavenworth.  How many of us would have done what Willis done and take the chance of being court martial or how many of us would have done their orders without any questions?  Many soldiers have faced this situation in real life and have made their choices but usually those choices have dire consequences. 
Finally, this movie did have good moments but should have been better and even though I'm a very big Bruce Willis fan, I was very disappointed of this movie.  The Dark Gengar rate this movie from a Gengar to Ten Gengars: a weak Seven Gengars Note during the television preview that I saw that mentioned ""it is the best action movie since Die Hard"".  I have to disagree, the first ""Die Hard"" was easily a high 9.  Sayonara and Godspeed.",Tears of the Sun
135,driffma,A great action movie..,9,28 May 2003,"`Men, we are about to step into some serious s***.'  - Lt A.K. Waters.Bruce Willis plays Navy SEAL Lt. A.K. Waters in Antoine Fuqua's Tears of the Sun.  This is a gritty movie about a SEAL mission to evacuate foreign nationals from a country fast spiraling out of control.  Waters and his team are ordered to go to a Catholic mission and retrieve Dr. Lena Hendricks (Monica Bellucci)  and, if they wish to come, two nuns and a priest. When the SEALs arrive at the mission they find it overrun with victims of the recently erupted civil war.  During which ethnic hatreds that had only existed beneath the surface before the fighting began emerge in the form of full-blown ethnic cleansings.  None of this matters a bit to Waters or the rest of his team. That leaving the refuges behind will mean their almost certain deaths is peripheral to their objective of removing the foreign nationals.  Of course the good doctor does not see things that way will no t leave without her refugees.  She and the Lt. make compromise.  Only able-bodied people and their children can come.  The doctor quickly agrees and with all haste prepares for a long and weary road.  The compromise was not entirely honest on the part of the Lt., and he only makes it to get the `packages' as they are called, moving.  At some point though Lt. Waters has a change of heart and thus while he and his team are en route to the relative safety of the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman he gives the order to turn the choppers around.  So the Navy SEALs turn around and decide to guide the refuges (minus some kids and some old, and unfit ones that get put on the choppers) to Cameroon.I have not given anything away, mind you.  The film's trailer revealed as much.  So you can probably guess that the rest of the film will be about the heroes (here I mean the refugees and the SEALs) escape to Cameroon and further that the film might simply degenerate into a relatively mindless, popcorn action film.  But this it does not do.  Under Fuqua's direction the film remains much more somber, much more reserved.  That is not to say that there is not violence.  There is and a lot of it.  The violence though is not there to distract the viewer from the content of the film.  Rather, it grounds the film in reality.Bruce Willis is the perfect actor for this movie.  Never before has there been a performer who can convey so much with out a single word.  He looks and acts very much the part of the long time Navy SEAL.  There is a perfect weariness to his performance.  Everyone in the film gives convincing performances.  These guys had me convinced they were all Special Forces guys (Interestingly one of them was. Actor Charles Ingram was a Force Recon Marine.).  They move like they have always had a CAR-15 or a SAW strapped to their bodies and that the only thing they would ever wear would be black face paint and jungle camouflage.  And they are not the only performances worth noting.  Monica Bellucci gives a fine performance as the humanitarian doctor, and Fuqua's desire for realism lead him to fly Nigerians into Hawaii (where the movie was filmed) to play the parts of the refugees and the perpetrators of the coup.  Put it all together and you have quite a compelling film.The film has its flaws of course.  But it keeps them to a bare minimum. There is some hokey dialogue at the end that will drive you batty.  I think. And there is an embrace at the end that I certainly could have done without.  These are minor quibbles though.  This movie gets a 9.",Tears of the Sun

143,rickhavoc1,Arguably Bruce Willis' Best Work To Date,10,9 September 2007,"This movie isn't easy to watch, because it shows the horrible, ugly truth that we hide behind the sanitary euphemism ""ethnic cleansing"", (trying to make it sound like somebody taking a bath). Like someone else who posted here, I got the movie on DVD, so I got to watch the documentary on the making of this movie. Bruce had been wanting to make it for a few years before he got to make it, and the fact that he cared so deeply is what makes it so powerful. In fact, Antione Fuqua and every actor involved were equally dedicated to telling this story and getting it right, to the point of getting a retired Navy SEAL to train them in SEAL weapons and tactics, and calling each other by their character names even when not filming. I saw a comment posted here that said they didn't think a SEAL team commander would do something like this in real life. Well, I want to tell you two things. In the US military, the first rule of command is that you never give an order that you KNOW won't be obeyed. That's why Lt. Waters commander kept ADVISING him, rather than ordering him to abandon the refugees. Also, in the US military, you are NOT expected to ignore your conscience. It is an old tradition that if your conscience tells you to go beyond your orders, you won't be punished if you succeed. In fact, you are likely to be commended or even decorated (with a medal). Somebody else who posted here complained about the way Bruce played his part. Well, you dope, I guess you just didn't get it. He was playing the part of a man who had been suppressing his humanity for years behind an emotionless facade, and finally reached a point where he just couldn't do it anymore. Besides, all you had to do was look in his eyes. There was one particularly moving scene where he was standing back, watching as the team corpsman, Doc, Dr. Kendricks, and one of the refugees were tending to a woman who had been horribly tortured and mutilated. Anyone with eyes to see could see the sorrow, anger, and disgust on his face. I thought the earlier scene where the team's NCO's, Zee and Red, caught the Nigerian soldier torturing her was equally powerful. The senior NCO, Zee became so incensed that he handed his pistol to Red, grabbed the guy, and forced his head around and made him look at her, and said, ""Look at your work, motherf&%#er!"", then pulled out his knife and plunged it into the bastard's guts, and shoved it in so hard he grunted with the effort. He wanted to make sure the bastard felt some pain as he died. I would've twisted the knife, too, if it were me. I thought the actor playing Zee, Eamonn Walker, was depicting an authentic combat reaction of a man of honor. I also want to mention that in his interview in the documentary, he spoke with a British accent, but you didn't hear a trace of it in the movie. There are some American actors, particularly southern ones, who could learn something from British actors like him and Russell Crowe about suppressing their normal accent for a movie role. I would suggest to anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet that they get the DVD and watch the documentary first, so they will understand both the commitment that went into making it, and the reason they accurately depict atrocities in it. Also the reason they fought to bring in real Africans to play the refugees.I was particularly impressed by the acting ability shown by two of them, Akosua Busia and Sammi Rotibi. I hope some casting directors take notice. I also liked the subtle romance that develops between the two main characters. All in all, a great movie. 10/10",Tears of the Sun

I'm talking walk out of the theater pathetic!,1,23 March 2003,"(WARNING: CONTAINS A SPOILER, BUT MORE OF A SAVIOR IN THIS CASE!)I cannot believe this movie's rating here.  If I were Mr. Hand from Ridgemont High, I'd be saying ""You're all on dope""!  This movie tries to present itself as a serious war movie, but realism and common sense are nowhere to be found.  The only way I can imagine someone could possibly enjoy this turkey is if they knew nothing about the military to notice the relentless lack of realism.My hopes were not very high to begin with.  I saw it billed on TV as ""The Best War Movie Since Black Hawk Down"".  Since that only came out a little over a year ago, that isn't saying much.Still, I'd take ""We Were Soldiers"" or ""Hart's War"" over this total junk any day.  It makes them both look like classics in comparison.There was only one thing in this movie that was remotely plausible- extremist African Muslims trying to wipe out Christians.  Practically everything else was beyond ridiculous and would never happen.In fact, it seemed as if they were determined to make it ridiculous.  The only SEAL who had half a clue was the first one to catch a bullet.As can be confirmed by my voting history, I'm generally not very tough on films.  I can look past quite a bit of stupidity, but this movie refused to stop serving it up in shiploads.  I spent most of the time shaking my head, wanting to gag and trying to convince the person whose bright idea it was to see it to walk out with me. The cinematography, production value and special effects were all this movie had in its' favor.  I generally despised it too much to give it any credit for that.If you want to see a somewhat similar story executed world's more effectively, check out ""Three Kings"".

148,vidog316,Riveting...,8,9 March 2003,"TEARS OF THE SUN was marketed as a macho action movie, but I would classify it more as a drama. A riveting, and very emotional drama at that. Bruce Willis turns in a magnificent performance as Lt. AK Waters. He perfectly molds the badass persona of his character with the strong emotions and ethical values that he knows must be enforced. Likewise, the beautiful Monica Bellucci (Brotherhood of the Wolf) provides an excellent depiction of refugee doctor. Similarly to Black Hawk Down, TEARS OF THE SUN provides just the right mix of drama and action to make the audience feel as if it is right in the thick of things. While the first 2/3 of the movie is mainly formed around dramatic concepts and stealth warfare, the last 1/3 of the movie is where the action kicks in. A great sequence involving F-16's and a ballsy approach to the fight between the Special-Ops and Nigerian Rebels provides excitement while keeping the dramatic undertone intact. Overall, I would say that TEARS OF THE SUN is better than Black Hawk Down as well as any war movie since Saving Private Ryan. It comes highly recommended. If you don't see it for the riveting dramatic, emotional and action-packed two hours then at least see it for Monica Bellucci. Whew, she's gorgeous.**10 out of 10**",Tears of the Sun
149,Tokugawa,Excellent moving action film with a good message - liberals will hate it.,9,10 March 2003,"Having just seen ""Tears of the Sun"" I can understand why certain left-wing liberal reviewers ripped it. Here are the reasons:1. It honestly and correctly showed Muslim Fulanis in Nigeria massacring and slaughtering Christian blacks.2. It correctly showed the U.S. Military as good guys taking action against evil.3. It correctly showed the ""the only thing needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing"" - a clear reference to al-Qaeda, terrorism, and Iraq in 2003.The PC liberal America-haters and Hollywood degenerates and Communists will hate this film. But I thought it superb.In the tradition of many films such as ""Operation: Burma"", ""Distant Drums"", ""Predator"", and many others, an elite team goes on a mission behind enemy lines and has to march out fighting along the way. Willis' team was sent to rescue some white missionaries and a doctor in Nigeria being threatened by Muslim ethnic Fulanis who were massacring the Christian Ibo. The missionaries, typically, won't leave, and the good-looking female doctor, Monica Bellucci, with shirt conveniently unbuttoned at the top, will not leave without her patients, those who can walk. But there is a crucial secret about this she tells no one, endangering the entire mission - some the refugees are not what they seem.But the epiphany for Willis' character is seeing the massacred mission they just left, that after having lied to the doctor and abandoned her refugees and patients while flying away on helicopters. Exactly WHY Willis he has this epiphany, this revelation, to GO BACK in violation of orders to rescue these refugees, is never fully explained: he himself said ""I'm trying to figure it out"". Perhaps it doesn't even matter - what matters is he DID take a moral and humane course.They continue the march out of Nigeria heading towards the Cameroon border, all the while being suspiciously tracked all too easily by pursuing Fulanis, who for some reason seem very determined to stop them. Again, one of the refugees is not what he seems.After the climactic fight upon reaching Cameroon, the film ends with the famous Edmund Burke quote, ""The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing"". President Bush is NOT going to ""do nothing"" about Saddam Hussein, and that is why liberal reviewers feel so uncomfortable with this movie.The gore was much less than ""Blackhawk Down"", although some atrocities are referred to, but not shown in great detail. Some younger teenagers could see this, but I doubt if they'd appreciate the moral dilemma facing the Willis' character and his men: obey orders and abandon innocent people to certain horrible death, or, take action and do what is necessary. For those interested, there was also a lot less military hardware on display here.My complaints were minor. Eastern Nigeria looked a bit too much like Hawaii, which is where it was filmed. Willis was slightly too laconic, but good enough. One American character was an obligatory black man making reference to ""my people"". Puhleeze.Good film. Entertaining and compelling all the way. With a message very relevant for the world in 2003 - a cowardly world willing to do nothing about terrorists and mass murderers.

The only thing is that the movie channels Starz and Encore played it at least 1 or 2 times a day for around a month. But why vote bad about a movie just because you've seen it a lot. Like Saving Private Ryan, that movie never gets old. Back on topic, this revolves around an average military American who goes for the job and the job only, but that seems un-human like. In the American army, its not about you and serving your country, its about the man next to you, and anyone but you. So the human relationship is off for the commando's. But then again, you can't blame them, their lives are at stake, and I really don't want to get hit by a bullet the size of an adults finger at the speed of sound do you? But the American Doctor really cares for 'her people' while the commando's don't give a flying you know what.This movie is'nt really boring at all, there's not a lot of long talk scenes like in a G-rated Drama. But when there is, its dramatic.

The seal team very quietly taking out a platoon of murderous rebels in a jungle village is what really did it for me (pure silent, quick, and deadly stuff); and the final battle at the film's end - well you know it's fake, you know it is - is damned near nerve racking.  Bruce Willis, et al do a really good job.  I could have done without the pain-the-ass pretty female doctor crap (why couldn't the doctor be just an ordinary old fart white-haired man), but she finally calms down.  I know their were a few goofs, such as the weapons used by the planes in the final scenes (someone saw that, I didn't really notice), but hell, if that's the worst of it, so what?  This one is well done, just about at the level of `Saving Private Ryan.'",Tears of the Sun
156,jwerwin80,Smacks you in the face with the reality of ethnic cleansing,8,9 March 2003,"This isn't your average action/war movie. Bruce Willis and his group of special ops are sent to Nigeria to pick up an American doctor working as a missionary. The doctor is directly in the path of Nigerian troops and rebel forces. In their wake they leave a trail of corpses, rape victims, dismembered bodies, and lots of blood. It's a ring side seat to ethnic cleansing.The doctor refuses to accompany Bruce Willis out of the country unless the he agrees to rescue everyone in the mission. So the question becomes ... do you just take the doctor and leave? That accomplishes your mission and makes everyone happy. No one will blame you for leaving behind the refugees who will certainly be slaughtered. It's not your country, its not your war.
Tears of the Sun slaps you in the face with the reality of ethnic cleansing. It also acts as a reflection of the killing and violence we have on our own streets. No one says we have to do anything. We all to provide for ourselves and our families. That's a tough job. No one says that we also need to care about the homeless, people without medical insurance, or schools that don't have decent textbooks (or even toilet paper).The movie is a gut check. The world will say it's okay to just do your job, but do you feel like it's okay?",Tears of the Sun
157,greg_bbb,SEAL Team in AFRICA w/topics you never see and GORGEOUS JUNGLE,8,9 January 2021,"I do love this movie. Even though it's not Academy award stuff, it has SO many good points and scenes
1) Nick Chindlund - This really good actor gets to play the Good Guy for once as BW's comrade in Arms and his character is the most developed and sympathetic, does a great job and gets a good death scene
2) As many other reviews state, the military action is as close to real as it gets. That alone makes it a good film. But I thought the major theme was their transition from Mission Oriented to where they are fighting for something more than their orders. Question the film asks is WHY hasn't the USA done more of this type of military mission in Africa. and the films answer is that USA should do more missions to oppose such evil
3)Jungle cinematography is Awe Inspiring. there is no better movie to take a trip thru the jungle
4)Bruce Willis can carry a film and he does so here. But there are many good supporting actors add excellent lines/scenes, like the Colonel who bodyguards the prince. I never felt I was seeing actors as the refugees from the Mission flee thru the Jungle",Tears of the Sun

160,puckbond007,"Tears of the Sun-8/10 is a very solid, gritty and ultimately satisfying military rescue thriller...",8,14 March 2003,"Contains Spoiler Tears of the Sun is a very solid, gritty and ultimately satisfying military rescue thriller with a very realistic and intense setting and a solid cast lead by Bruce Willis and the surprising Monica Bellucci. Willis play Lieutenant Waters the leader of a small Special Ops team, who must go into the war-torn African nation of Nigeria and bring back an American doctor Lena Hendricks played by Bellucci, who is stationed at a mission deep in the African Jungle, soon to be overrun by ruthless and merciless rebel forces. Waters is a good leader, follows orders and gets the job done. His mission is to bring back the doctor, a priest ad two nuns from the mission. Complications arise when Doc. Hendricks refuses to go without some 70 refugees that she has been looking after...and knows that anyone who is left behind at the mission will be left to a slaughter. At first Waters and his team are reluctant to carry the extra burden of the 70 refugees, but a change of heart leads him facing impossible and improbable odds. It is up to him and his team to lead everyone through the treacherous jungle to safety across the boarder of neighboring country Cameroon. Bruce Willis is a favorite of mine I will admit, but he just seems to be getting better and better with age. His stern look and hardnosed smile is a strong and powerful dramatic presence on screen, yet still he can be smug, funny and can show warmth and compassion...all around a very versatile actor and he is very good in this film. Surprising me most was Monica Bellucci, now much has been made of this stunning beauty, but I haven't seen her in anything before. I got news for you...she can act and does a great job in this playing the stubborn and forceful doctor, who won't leave her people behind. Granted her accent may be a burden, but she has no problem conveying emotion or creating a convincing character like she does here. I wll also say this film is not pretty...the depiction of the brutal nature of ethnic cleansing and the slaughter of hundreds of innocent people, who are just caught in civil war and political upheval is not easy to take. There is an especially gruesome and horrifying scene involving a dying and raped woman who is found in a hut in a village the special forces are forced to attack. This is what goes on in a lot of these Third World nations where religious beliefs and devastating poverty lead to brutal and unbelievable cruel violence. It is a film that doesn't pull its punches in this regard. I also loved the setting of this film...the jungle these people have to fight and claw their way through is beautiful and ominous at the same time. Now some might dismiss this film as maybe too slow...and for some it might be, but films like this should take their time telling an important story. Some may also dismiss this film as just an action movie with a patriotic American hero ending, but it is much more than that and I found it totally engrossing the whole way through. Overall, Tears of the Sun is a solid, convincing military rescue thriller that looks at the horrors of ethnic cleansing and civil war. It features a great setting, some good action and features two very solid performances by the always dependable Bruce Willis and relative newcomer, the gorgeous Monica Bellucci. Highly recommended...one of the best of the year so far.",Tears of the Sun
161,stack-11,A whole army cannot defeat a handful of soldiers!,1,6 April 2008,"Although a film with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, you better skip this one. I watched this one on television, so I didn't have to plunk down cash for it. Lucky me.The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable, it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end. It is highly questionable, if a seasoned soldier like Lt. Waters would disobey direct orders. And even if he would, if the rest of his platoon would. They know he puts them in direct danger, and they know they will certainly die if they follow him, but what the heck, he is our Lt. so let's do what he says (despite the direct orders, remember).Still, there are some nice scenes in this movie. They somewhat save a village, where the total population is being massacred by the rebels. Well, they save a dozen villagers or so, the rest was already killed. The strange part of it, that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind. They rather go on foot. Maybe because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for it. Anyway. I think this was what earned the movie the one point I gave it.What made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves. Only near the end they loose a few comrades. And that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more. Can you believe that?They fight of an army of so many, kill hundreds of them, and only loose a few of themselves. And they have rounds and round of ammo. Never run out of it. Grenades and claymore mines, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get this stuff. Carrying it around or what? They even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery which goes on for days. Really? Who think up this crap.I guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. If not, skip this one. It saves you time.",Tears of the Sun
162,movesukkaz,total 80's cheese,1,5 March 2003,"very bad movie. Just when I thought Bruce Willis actually gave up his lame 80's tough guy crap he comes out with this, a complete rip off of every stupid 80's jungle action movie in existence. Seriously unoriginal and boring to boot. I mean this was actually worse than Rambo. Every scene is so predictable..""no you cant stay here, its too dangerous"", ""I'm not going anywhere, my people are here"" haha gimme a break! Willis' flat hollow acting is especially annoying, and the doctor lady with her constant yelling...unbearable. Like how can anyone call this entertainment? The only thing different in this 80's remake is the lack of cheesy one liners, although Willis doesn't completely disappoint and still manages to stammer out one or two exceptionally unclever ones.

This is one such movie.Unlike maybe Behind Enemy Lines, wich started out great and totally blew at the end, this movie delivers: A storyline wich is credible and there was far more realism than I had foreseen.

169,FMK,Pointless and Offensive,3,5 May 2004,"This movie was recommended to me by my video clerk, and I will now do my utmost to get him fired. It is a terrible movie. And I'm not even talking about the terrible script, terrible direction, terrible acting - pretty bad editing too.What's wrong with? God, where to start. Okay, let's start with how flat it is. All through watching it I was waiting for development. Character development. Story development. Plot development. Any development at all.But no.Willis plays his character, probably intended to be a suffering, traumatized soldier torn between duty and humanity, by frowning a lot and looking threateningly into the middle distance, while collecting more and more dirt, blood and wounds in the best Die Hard fashion.Monica Belluci does her character, who I can guess from the setting is supposed to be a kind of medical missionary with a good heart and a cynical mind, by making meaningful faces and cursing in Spanish.Since the things these to say to each other grow more friendly as the movie progresses, I'm also guessing there is supposed to be some warming up of their acquaintance. But their interaction starts out wooden and unconvincing, and remains so throughout 115 minutes of boredom, with the embrace at about 20 minutes as the wince-inducing low.There's violence and gore, and lots of it. Now I don't mind violence and gore; quite the contrary. But here, where it serves only to shout the message that the bad guys are really, really evil and the good guys thus really, really good, it misses the point entirely. Give me *some* ambivalence, please!*** SPOILER ALERT ***Then, at about two-thirds, as if to dash the little remaining hope the movie will amount to anything, there's a bad, bad scene where the son of the murdered president gets to do a kind of motivational speech. While not quite as horrible as the Emperor's speech at the end of The Last Samurai, it does a good job of trying to top that one. And 20 minutes later, just when I thought I'd left my empathic embarassment about the speech scene behind me, there's the moment when the refugees are rescued and they start cheering President Jr., and everybody tells everyone else they love them. All that was lacking was a big group hug and some soft-focus. Bwerk!*** END SPOILER ALERT ***But the worst really was that the movie has no merit at all.

171,se7en45,Tears of a wasted opportunity...,4,28 June 2003,"My expectations were very high in regards to the visual aspect of this film. For months now, both here in the UK and the USA, critics and viewers have waxed lyrical about the magnificent cinematography that ignites the screen with an explosion of orgasmic colour which defies description. Where the heck was it? I looked very hard... I just saw drab browns, murky greens, muted yellows, muddy water, grainy sunlight, etc. The colour saturation was so weak that I had to increase the television's internal colour setting to almost MAXIMUM to appreciate the jungle setting of this film.
Now before you make a howl of complaint about the fault being with my DVD, I can happily report that all the menu-boards on the disc are literally bursting with lush golden sunlight, sparkling greens that throb with life and the jungle looks like the Garden of Eden. The picture on the DVD is in 2:40 widescreen, very sharp and detailed, in fact it's so sharp that you can even count the hairs growing on Bruce Willis' cheeks, in the close-ups of the leafs we can actually see the green veins beneath the surface and later when we behold a bunch of bananas, you can easily count each individual fruit. This is a pristine presentation by Columbia which unfortunately lacks any life when it comes to colour. I personally think that this is the look that Antoine Fuqua desired when he shot the film, maybe the cinema prints utilized the regular lush coloured print whilst the DVD retained the effect that the director wanted. In that case, I can fully understand why Fuqua wanted to give his film a harsh and dirty appearance which would add atmosphere and realism to those darkly lit jungle scenes. The only time the colour breathes a sign of life is when the napalm fires up the green fields into an inferno of raging red fire. The jet black earth mingles into the yellow blaze and the blue sky is ripped apart with white tears through which we literally see the sun weeping! It brings a whole new meaning to the title. It would have been brilliant if Columbia had treated films fans to BOTH prints of this film - colour saturated and director's vision as they did with ""THE GENERAL"" by John Boorman.
Now that I've voiced my criticisms about the colour scheme, I move onto the editing in this film. I was very disappointed with the point-and-shoot camera angles that didn't utilize rapid stylized shots that would have injected the film with suspense and excitement. Fuqua's approach was almost like a lazy documentary, the opening even starts off very much like a news report. There was no sense of momentum or menace, just a plodding and slow trek through the jungle. The suspense levels were extremely low and lacked any danger. I cannot believe that Fuqua was the man behind the blood-pounding ""REPLACEMENT KILLERS"" or the visceral ""TRAINING DAYS"". Those films had his signature in every scene, even in the sombre moments Fuqua was able to bring some urgency to the proceedings. But, sadly, in his new film, it just looks like he became bored with the project. I pray he finds fresh inspiration or else I really fear what he might do with the proposed ""KING ARTHUR"" movie.Let's quickly take a peek at the wafer thin script which seems to have been written on the back of some toilet paper. This is, without doubt, one of the lamest ideas I've seen this year. Originally the film was going to be called ""DIE HARD IV"" but they decided to make some changes to the script and this is what they've tweaked it into. A simple story with simple execution. Absolutely nothing remotely original here, if you want to watch a classic film about African issues and revolutions, etc, then watch ""THE WILD GEESE"" (starring Richard Burton, Roger Moore, Stewart Granger and Richard Harris). Fuqua's film is almost a virtual remake minus all the glory and passion of the original. That fine movie left me emotionally shattered at the climax, the cinematography always hinted at some unseen menace in the African landscape and it really captured the essence of fear as men prepare to fight their last battle and meet their creator.However, although I was not happy with this weak and exploitative script which portrayed the African Natives as nothing more than beastly barbarians who need ""Massa"" (just think of the vomit inducing scene where the Black girl thanks the White saviours at the film's climax), I was nevertheless pleased that any reference to politics and religion were kept to a minimum. It really could have been a complete disaster in the wrong hands, so thankfully, it didn't tread that path.
The saving grace of ""TEARS OF THE SUN"" was Bruce Willis' face. That was the best part of the cinematography. There were times when all else would stop and the camera would linger on his glistening head, then it would slowly spiral and waltz around his smouldering face, the anger just frothing beneath the calm exterior, his eyes filled with anguish and a vulnerability which gave him an air of a Greek god. His limited vocabulary and awkward behaviour towards Monica Bellucci were very effective. In my estimation, Bruce Willis has sharpened his skills as an actor, his swagger and posture were very authentic and he certainly drips charisma in every scene. It reminds me of the way John Wayne developed as an actor, he got better and more refined as he got older, just like a rare wine that improves with age just so with Bruce Wills. This new mature appearance adds gravitas to his performance.
Monica Bellucci, as always guaranteed, gave a realistic reading of her role. Even with greasy hair, specks of blood and mud smeared across her cheeks, sweat running down her itching back, despite all that her earthy sexiness still shone through the sweltering jungle. She was the earth mother incarnate for the African Natives. Her manner was very natural and expressive, and even in scenes of desperate brutality, she behaved strongly and with deep courage. At times she seemed more powerful as a leader than the soldiers with all their huge guns and rockets.
I was very disappointed that Eamonn Walker was left with nothing to do but stand around looking profound and noble. A man of his stature was reduced to playing Bruce Willis' shadow and conscience. His task, I think, was to help us understand the complexities invading the mind of Bruce Willis as he made his gut-wrenching decisions.
I thought the soldier who played the explosives expert was very good too. This guy, Cole Hauser, was also the evil skinhead who trains the young student in ""HIGHER LEARNING"". Just listen to the gravel in his voice! In my opinion he looks very much like the young Tom Berenger from ""FEAR CITY"".
The black actor, I forget his name, who tracks Bruce Willis' team, was awesome. He looked a bit like Samuel L Jackson and didn't have a great deal of dialogue. It's to his ability as an actor that we can still see the venom reeking from his eyes. His visual appearance was very sleek, oiled and neat, he reminds me of a black cobra, silent and deadly, tracking his prey patiently and with authority. It was good to see evil portrayed like this instead of some demented screaming and punching the air with larger than-life gestures. This guy was a complete professional, no comedic one-liners or stupid sniggers of laughter, he steered well away from the pantomime villains that we normally see in action films. I look forward to more from this man.
The music by Hans Zimmer was extremely effective in conveying the tragedy of Africa, the wailing choirs and orchestral marches were breathtaking and evocative, this is another superb score that adds an extra dimension and depth to the film. The sound-scape was very similar to another score he did in 2001 for ""BLACK HAWK DOWN"". Again, that was a score that touched me deeply with its rich level of emotion. ""TEARS OF THE SUN"" is another step on the same journey and is certainly memorable.
Overall, if my expectations had been low, if I hadn't gone in expecting lush jungles and seductive sunlight seeping through the leaves (remember ""RASHOMON""?), if the script had been tighter, if Fuqua had allowed his stylistic visual flourishes to emerge, if all that had been balanced then this film would have been a force to be reckoned with. In my book, for what it's worth, I still rank ""APOCALYPSE NOW"", ""PLATOON"", ""DEAD PRESIDENTS"", ""THE WILD GEESE"", ""HEAVEN & EARTH"", ""THE DEER HUNTER"", ""THE THIN RED LINE"", ""CASUALTIES OF WAR"", etc, all of these are placed higher when compared to the mess in this Bruce Willis vehicle.
I have a feeling though, now that I've seen the film and know what to expect, next time I see ""TEARS OF THE SUN"", I think that I will just go in and be entertained by it. It's still much better than the sappy syrup of ""PEARL HARBOR"".",Tears of the Sun

Ryan and Act of Valour, the last three of which have similar premise of a rescue/extraction. While the acting by the cast seemed decent and the script tried to showcase the worst of human acts, somewhere the screenplay couldn't exactly connect well between the emotion and action.Going deeper into the script (Spoiler alert), I couldn't really believe the decision of the Lieutenant from the very beginning who got around to each of his rescue's requests so easily (some of them I thought were simply stupid), especially when a lot of lives where at risk due to the diplomatic & military confrontations that can arise due to his actions. Ofcourse, that was the whole point of the movie I assume to depict the choices of a soldier when he tries to do the right thing instead of just following orders.On the positive side, I liked the confusion & doubt created in the minds of the SEAL team due to the choices of their leader but nevertheless standing strong with whatever he decides. There were a few cliches too (eg. the last fight & retaliation at the border) but then what fun would it be for ordinary audience to watch a movie without those. There was not much of over-the-top patriotism also which somewhat kept the movie grounded, atleast until the climax.Overall, it is a decent movie for a one-time watch, provided one keeps his/her expectations right.",Tears of the Sun

It never seemed to develop an edge like ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" though. It was very slow in some parts... I even struggled staying awake once or twice.

They really missed an excellent opportunity when they down played finding the president's son among the refugees.  When that was first revealed I thought... ""Oh boy... now it's going to get good""  but it was downplayed in a big way.  I'm not even sure why they put it in the movie.  I wanted to see the calvary called in to protect the president's son.  The calvary was called in later for other reasons.  The scene in the village was my favorite...

I'm no U.S. Navy Seal and I dont know their codes and procedures, and neither do I go to a movie to learn about them. I watch a movie to be entertained, and 'Tears of the Sun' did exactly that. Antoine Fuqua has paced the film incredibly well, making sure that there isnt a dull moment to deal with. He not only uses Willis and Belluci to the fullest, but extracts many mini-perfomances out of the supporting cast to deliver a well rounded movie. Bruce Willis is fantastic as ""A.K. Waters"", a hard-bitten commando who's been trained as an elite covert machine, and expected to complete missions at all costs. There is no extra emotion from Willis, he plays his part perfectly well. Monica Belluci [gorgeous isnt she?!], has done a good job as Dr. Lena Hendricks, being extremely naive and humanitarian, just as you would expect her to be.

For those who are behind our military brothers + sisters, it helps to know that in real life Bruce Willis just recently tried hard to get accepted into the military but was turned down due to age.(Foxnewschannel report @ 03/02) WHAT A GUY!!!!

179,GaelinW,"Well Done, But Released At the Wrong Time",9,10 August 2003,"In reading the criticisms of this movie, here and elsewhere, my response is, TEARS OF THE SUN is a militarily based action MOVIE, not a war documentary. If all such movies were done in correct and exact military fashion without any Hollywood embellishment, only military tacticians would go see them. That said, all the information you need to know to understand the background of this film is there if you look and listen for it.In the beginning, a newscaster reads, 'In a land with 120 million people and over 250 ethnic groups, there has been a long-standing history of ethnic enmity. Particularly between the Fulani Muslims in the North and the Christian Ebo in the South.' Soon afterward, mentioned are  `ethnic cleansing,' `ethnic unrest,' and  `control of Nigeria's vast oil supplies.' What else is there to know about why the `war' is going on in the film?
Also told is that the US is evacuating foreign nationals. And Monica Bellucci's character is described as being, `a critical personality,' code words for `from a family with money and influence.'  What else do you need to know about why a Seal team goes in?The violence, gore, the emotions of the refugees and the faces of the Seals after witnessing the gore tell you the rest.  The evil that men are capable of doing to other men, is something that can never be explained or understood, no matter how many expository scenes a film has.
The Serbs/Croatians in Eastern Europe. The Catholics/Protestants in Ireland. The Kurds in Iraq. The Palestinians/Jews. Tibet and China. The `background' could, unfortunately, fit any number of peoples, not only those in Africa.
OVERALL, a very well done movie, in terms of action, actually having a plot, and a cast that can carry it all off. I'm sure this film would have done better at the box office had it been released at another time.  With all that's going on in the world these past couple of years, the last thing movie goers want to see is another film about war on foreign soil. Too bad for TEARS OF THE SUN, because it it deserved to do much, much better.",Tears of the Sun
180,oscarlawren,being good means choosing not the easy out,8,25 February 2011,"This is a movie in which Bruce Willis is not only fighting the odds again as many other of his pictures, f.e. last man standing that contains a lot of meaningless gang-violence. But this more. First there is reality. This is a first and foremost a picture about the gruesomeness of ethnic cleansing, a movie about soldiers raping and mutilating men and women in sadistic fashion. It is also a picture about betrayal, out of fear and hatred, it is an invitation to challenge your thoughts about saving yourself at the cost of many others. Choices must be made, we learn, and they can be intolerably naive, because people bent on murder do not listen to reason, but they can also be wise, recklessly brave and show us valor. This picture is surprisingly good to be hones. Willis plays his role in a subdued fashion and his co-actors are performing in an admirable fashion. The underlying message is worth memorizing: evil can only spread and grow if good people do not act. But doing the right thing might a a dangerous thing.

The subject is dealt with in a compassionate and sensitive manner and all actors involved were superb in their roles. The effects are not spectacular but they don't need to be, this isn't a film about special effects it is one about the people of war rather than the 'battles' themselves.Bruce Willis is brilliant, going from a hardened navy seal to actual human being in saving the last remaining hope for the Ibo nation. All the cast and supporting actors were brilliant (in particular Cole Hauser's performance should also be noted)and the cast could not have been better.It amazes me that Tears of the Sun was a box office flop, the plot is one which allows you to really get a feel for the characters and their struggle and the director and actors do a superb job in making the film a powerful and brilliant piece.A must see film.",Tears of the Sun

188,brooksmurphy-1,"An enjoyable, but melodramatic war film.",6,10 June 2003,"The characters are too one-dimensional to begin with, in the film, which is okay, if the audience eventually learns more about them. Unfortunately, we never get to see any development or potential for characteristics. This leads us to believe that these soldiers are actually robots, who have somehow gained emotion. Bruce Willis plays a subtle, cold-hearted Lieutenant who spontaneously gains a conscience after learning that he must leave behind a group of Nigerian Refugees. He turns back and stays with them, urged on by Monica Belluci's character (a humanitarian doctor from Spain). His troops, a group of about several men, follow him, some for the idea, some against it. At the climax of a slaughtering of the village from which the refugees came (by Nigerian Rebels), all the soldiers suddenly gain consciences along with their Lieutenant. This film followed a lot of elements in the typical humanitarian war movie, but it also avoided many. An enjoyable melodramatic war film that redeems itself with lack of back story and the constant vulnerability of the protagonists. I loved how it all took place in the Nigerian jungle and didn't have to track back to explain the soldiers' origins.

194,wnfwyhp,Exciting War Film That Plays With Your Heart,8,14 August 2020,"Bruce Willis stars as Lieutenant Waters, a soldier in Nigeria who has the mission to rescue a doctor helping victims of the war raging on. This film had a lot to it, and as someone who enjoys war movies but doesn't watch them to often, mainly because there are other things I would prefer, I still enjoyed this one.Although this movie was made in 2003, there is something about the camerawork that feels ahead of its time. The lighting is excellent and it doesn't have any of those annoying shaky cams we see on tons of films today... I'm looking at you Michael Bay.Throughout the film, we are shown the utter horror of war. In the beginning, we are struck with having to wonder which side we should take when it comes to the soldiers trying to save people, and those people who want to stay back. It's disheartening to watch and is done great as it already fuels emotion in the viewer.Waters is portrayed as an uptight solider, although he is just doing his job. He needs to follow orders but from a viewpoint of someone who cares more about morality and what is right, it is a hard pill to swallow.Waters has great character progression and development throughout the film, first beginning when he calls the helicopter around to save all the Nigerians his group left behind. After this key moment, we start to see how he shows compassion for those who, without him, would be losing their lives in just over an hour.The pacing of this movie is good. It's not spectacular, however, as the first half feels a little bit dragged behind, even if it is meant to build up the story. All the scenes with the chasing and bullets being fired at one another was an exciting thing to watch. The film had a great and fulfilling ending.I enjoyed watching this film as it was filled with action and some suspense. Bruce Willis portrayed his character very well and almost every other actor and actress did a fantastic job as well. That is why this film deserves an 8/10.",Tears of the Sun

The battle scene( which was only 15 minutes of the entire movie) was so badly choreographed that i was hoping Willis would be killed(unfortunately he wasnt).

Nice. Of course, there was that scene when Belucci is running showing her décolleté. Not to talk about the sexual tension between her character and Willi´s.

197,90403,"Thank you White Man, you saved us again. . .",6,23 June 2003,"If you're familar with war films in general, this one most closely resembles John Wayne's distillation of the entire Vietnam conflict in THE GREEN BERETS (1968) than any of the others in the current batch of war flicks.  If you liked that film, then you will like how TEARS OF THE SUN once again represents American forces as righteous and compassionate saviors, helping the poor, disadvantaged natives, and fighting for them their faceless monolithic tormentors.From the trailer, I expected a bit more depth from the film than that, though.  There's nothing really wrong with the performances of the main players.  Bruce Willis is at his most Bruce-Willis-esque, with self-contemplating steely-eyed close-ups aplenty in the jungle.  Monica Bellucci is great as the obstinate counterpart.  The supporting cast do their best with what lines that are given them, which isn't much since they're mostly undefined set pieces (Suffice to say, if a couple of the ill-defined characters were missing, I wouldn't know).  The rebel villains are just plain cartoonish.Two things that I see could have made this film great:  1) More time needs to be spent on the individual soldiers' transformation as they become affected by the horrors of war.  As it stands it feels contrived.  A few sad facial expressions just don't do it, considering they've all decided to risk their own lives/careers for the cause.  2) The gratefullness of the Africans could be toned down somewhat and it would still be effective.  As it is, it's too feel-good, bordering on corny.  But for better or for worse, ""feel-good"" is what producer Joe Roth is known for, and I suspect his influence comes through more than Antoine Fugua's direction at the end.Of the recent stuff, if you want more suspense, check out BEHIND ENEMY LINES (2001).  For something a bit more concrete, there's always Ridley Scott's BLACKHAWK DOWN (2001).",Tears of the Sun

It is a dark movie, but very passioned made as well. I think the director wantet us to remind on what was, or is, going on in Africa and he certainly did. The story is quite simple, some logic faults. Why whould an L.T move out with 30 villagers to then save just the doctor. He could have forced the doc to go with him (Some kind of injection or so). I think it is not the thing a professional Navy Seals L.T whould do. I liked to see the Seals taking out the rebells in the village, slow, smooth, professional. It was hard to see those powerfull, disturbing images, they can overwhelm and they are reality.Over all i liked the picture, because it is dark, it is real and it is entertaining.

Though it's a good movie. The only part that tickled me was that this conflict never happened. But, I think even if it's an invented story, it could fit with a lot of situations of Civil Wars in Africa. It would have been better if at least they had invented the country's name instead of picking Nigeria... Another interesting thing is how the US Army, reacts to the fact that a lot of civilians are gonna get killed, and they order the soldiers not to bring them. I think that the goal of the movie was to show us to the ongoing conflicts in Africa and third World, how it is difficult to achieve peace and how our Soldiers must react to those situations. It also shows us that Americans (occident maybe) don't really care about Africans I guess, this movie depicts that the soldiers were there only to do their mission. It was a great scene to see that the soldiers were ready to give their lives to save the villagers (Very Cliché, I agree) and finally all dying to achieve a good action. In overall this movie was great. The reason why I saw this movie is because I'm a Hans Zimmer's fan, and I appreciate his dramatic violin Soundtracks. I think that this one is my second favorite after Gladiator. Anyway, this movie is Hard, violent, there is a lot of blood, and there is a strong moral, but I would not dare say it's better than Blood Diamond, but it's the same genre.",Tears of the Sun

204,irfan_baig,"Good War Movie, few loose ends, Willis was excellent!",7,9 March 2003,"I saw this movie just because I am a die-hard Bruce Willis fan and really adore the Italian actress Monica Bellucci. For a change, she had a decent role in a movie. The setting is in Nigeria, a ficticious general takes over and calls for ethic killing all over the country. People are killed and women, raped with their body parts cut off. Willis plays Lt. Waters, a rescue team leader in the US Marines sent to save some non-African doctors and religious preachers in the endangered forests. This is somewhat a display of why US' international intervention policies are necessary, in my opinion.
Since the doctor (Bellucci) refuses to leave without her patients, and the choppers carry only 12 people. Willis decides to follow his conscience and walk the remaining people, including his fellow 6 marines in the rescue mission, the doctor and the Nigerian refugees upto the Cameroon border.  En route they come across different complications, interfere with a village massacre, find out one of the refugees has a transmitter and thus the Nigerian slayers were following them all the way, and in the end a counter attack with numerous Nigerian solders vs. 7 US Marines - outnumbered indeed. But the bottom line is Willis and his 3 surviving marines get the doctor and the surviving refugees to the border.What saved the film? Cutting the kissing scene at the end between Willis and Bellucci. We can do without uneccessary romance in a war movie, surely.
Overall, I gave the movie a 7/10. Worth watching, once.",Tears of the Sun

Please. Come on. Make an effort. Why have we got to be confronted by crap like this continuously??? Does nobody have any idea what US soldiers did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam etc?

In this movie, of course, there's no context for the violence; the ""bad guys"" are simply evil people who do terrible things for no reason. The only salvation for the cringing masses of Nigeria (probably the only African country the screenwriter knew of offhand) is through the selfless courage of the American military.

207,cooperaitaliano,A very powerful and authentic film with a strong moral theme,9,22 July 2005,"This film was simply incredible. I didn't see it at the cinema, which upon seeing it later on DVD release, regretting missing first time round.It made some incredibly powerful statements and was very difficult to watch. I rarely admit to this, but I actually found parts of it so moving, that I cried! And I never cry.The choice of Bruce Willis was a good one and he plays a deeply conflicted character, he plays him with depth. I have seen Monica Belucci in films before. She is an incredibly gifted actress and she really believed in this project. Her character comes across as having strong religious and moral convictions, prepared to die to help and protect others. This comes across in the decisions she takes and the willingness to stand strong under pressure.Having seen the Documentary on the special features section of the DVD afterwards, I could see the incredible lengths that everyone attached to the filming went to. Each of the actors playing Seal Team members, went through some very authentic training in preparation and stayed in character outside of filming during the day. Given the commitment of all those attached to the film, I can see why the film is what it is.The director, Antoine Fuqua, from the films I have seen in which he directed, brings a strong moral theme to his characters and the story. The whole visual manner of filming, camera angles, close ups etc adds to the intensity here.The choice of filter during filming, that gives a subdued and darker feeling visually, was perfect. The use of Africans as extras was an interesting and a suitable choice, given their backgrounds. Many of these extras were showing genuine emotions which was captured on camera, as they relived traumatic moments in their lives when certain scenes were filmed.On that note, one scene in particular made for very difficult viewing, but totally in context and I would expect it would provoke a strong reaction from viewers, for good reason. The actual combat scenes are kept selectively short and in context to the overall film. They are also very realistic. The soundtrack was well suited and complimented the whole overall feel to the film. I would not say that this film was entertaining, it is very hard to watch but it is an example of good film that will challenge everyone who watches it and who has a conscience.After seeing this film, as with Hotel Rwanda and Tears of the Sun, I am constantly reminded of our individual and collective moral responsibilities in the 'civilised Western World' when atrocities are committed. And it sits badly with my conscience that 'we' in the West do so little and so late in trying to stop such genocide from happening. I for one think that every adult should see it.",Tears of the Sun
208,increator,Exciting!,7,12 April 2005,"Well, for start, the movie uses a really simple formula in most of it: One REAL and cheap punch into face is better than fireworks worth of $100000.This works pretty fine, in most cases, too. A subject that shakes people out of their normal life, and the way it's shown - gives movie a lot of tense. Movie shows some horrid scenes where much is not shown, but left for imagination... which usually amplifies the effect. Like screams from a village under attack, fast clips from bird's eye view upon a destroyed settlement, a sea that's turned red... ""Can such things happen in our world at present day? Right now? Somewhere... there?"" This is what shocks and people don't feel so safe anymore when turning off DVD player or walking home from cinema after the movie.From drama side, movie is extremely strong. It's story and how it's implemented - is so well done that it covers almost all shortcomings in realism, battle scenes and acting. At the introduction documentary(?), where riots run around the town and scenes of solider beating a child make a good job pulling you into shocking and intense movie. And after watching the movie, you are not thinking about what was wrong, but still about the parts that shook you. Yet, there's some occasions, where things look funny, and that doesn't fit very well.Realism gets strong hit here, there's way too little of realism. Especially, since it's a war-movie (sort of) and weapons & battle deserve more details here.For example, 9 soldiers battling against 300+? Or the scene where hundreds of enemies just rushed towards bullets without making a single shot? The soldiers themselves carry way too much weapons, and they're way too pointless in this environment, especially since soldiers knew well where they're heading. Why carry a shotgun in the jungle? Safari? Or two assault rifles, LAW, sniper rifle and a pistol all at the same time? The armament most likely covers all modern weaponry, and whole of this mass is fit onto 9 people -- sent to a mission for 1 day, with no orders to engage a battle... The decisions in situations are also very unbelievable.At some point, movie starts to look more like a documentary or a soap opera - most time there's just actors' face closeups that are seen.But this all mixed with very emotional scenes, superb sound effects and very, very good musical background make so much atmosphere that you will be most definitely sucked into the movie, and It's definitely worth a look.",Tears of the Sun

Other than being one big piece of propaganda for the war with Iraq this film has little to no substance and had trouble keeping my interest. The scenes of combat (the last entertaining piece of the movie) unfortunatly are of the same quality as this films dialogue, simply bad. At moments I thought that this movie made an effort to portray realistic situations, yet this belief faded very quickly at the last battles of the movie that brought memories of Arnold's old action movies to mind. Why wasn't Arnold in this film? maybe he didn't want to destroy his career anymore.  This movie is so ""pro war"" and with the addition of the qoute they put up at the end of the film (""Evil exists when good men do nothing."" or something like that) I felt like Big Brother was whispering in each of the viewers ears as they stared at the screen in the popcorn infested theatre. This effect left a very bad taste in my mouth and reminded me how thankfull I was that there were no Save the Children ads being shown when I saw About Schmidt.

Did it want to be a love story as it begins with a hardened veteran soldier going against orders on the whimsy of a bleeding heart beauty or did it want to be a moral story shoving grotesque scene's down your throat to get it across that what occurs in third world countries during revolution is a tragedy or did it want to be a war movie as the soldiers perform tactical moves while facing an army. Ultimately it couldn't decide, but it was definitely cheesy and inaccurate as to the workings of the US military. No man who lost half his men in battle while performing a mission that was strictly against his orders would ever command again. He has thrown away his military career on a weak plot line.

The acting consists mostly of the usual stern looks and grave growls with the predictable interlude of sentimental, low-voiced pep-talk. Fighting scenes are generally well-directed yet entirely improbable, with navy-seals bringing multiple grenades, sniper-rifles and shotguns on a routine, one-day mission.Self-gratification, no doubt, for the average American patriot.

Although the seals are depicted as order taking goons at the beginning the characters develop and many lessons are found. Honor, Love, Kindness, humbleness, devotion and a short journey to manhood. Honor is what stands out to me. The seals take on a nights of the round table attitude in this movie. We live in a world where we are taught to close our eyes and turn the other way to avoid conflict. Our government oozes this lesson to its soldiers. They truly are told to stand down while human rights are desecrated, sometimes in front of their eyes. We have the strongest army in the world and it is only used for power and seizure. It is nice to see them doing something honorable. Could you imagine if we went into countries to do the right thing and help rather than for $ reasons. Well perhaps we would be poor but at least we would hold our heads high. If we as humans don't stand together for human rights around the world then what is the point to it all.

215,jbensaved,One of the best,10,19 April 2006,This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. This movie draws you in; you get scarred for the characters and hope for the defeat of the villains. This is one of those rare moments where you forget that your watching a movie.I really think that this was the best movie of 2005. Bruce Willis does a great job but the breakout artist is Monica Belluci. The fact that she is possibly the most beautiful woman alive doesn't hurt in attracting you to this film.The first part of the movie is the character of Bruce Willis' dilemma of committing to duty or doing the right thing. We get to see him and Monica Belluci's struggle to trust and understand what it is they should do. The second part of the movie is a good 30 minute fighting scene that keeps you wondering which of the good guys will day. This is the best movie.,Tears of the Sun
216,SLCUT2222,RE: Behind Enemy Lines meets Black Hawk Down,7,7 March 2003,"Bruce Willis has at the least found a more memorable war movie than ""Hart's War.""  He plays a very convincing role as the leader of a US Navy Seal chaulk sent into Nigeria following a coup that pits the Islamic ethnic groups of the north against the mostly Christian south.  This movie does successfully bring out a scenario that could happen in a real life situation.  When does an officer in command order the rest of his men to go above and beyond orders and the call of duty?  Thats the moral question that is asked that I especially liked about the film.  There were some holes however.  What would a board of inquiry say about this, especially with several of his men KIA?  Would 2 FA-18 hornets alone be able to blast off an entire battalion of troops, or would additional fire support (from low specter gunships) be needed in the concluding scene? How did the Navy suddenly show up at the Cameroon border with the authority to open a sealed border?  Also like ""Black Hawk Down,"" the show beyond Bruce Willis role lacked character development.

217,david-goble,Apparently the Sun Cries,6,24 June 2006,"I'm a huge fan of Bruce Willis. I've seen just about every film he's been in and was looking forward to this film for months before it came out. His character wasn't a letdown nor was his performance, but the entire film was too melodramatic for my tastes, and I didn't really enjoy it.At any rate, here's a quick explanation of the plot: A group of special forces soldiers, led by Lt. Waters (Willis), enter a small African town (apparently in Nigeria) to extract a politically connected doctor (Monica Bellucci) and as a secondary mission objective, the three missionaries who are there working to help the people of Nigeria. The doctor refuses to come with him indicating that she needs to save the lives of the people under her care. This is after he indicates that a group of guerrilla members led by a ruthless warlord are on the way to the town.After about thirty minutes of annoying story involving the refusal to leave, the doctor finally agrees to come along if all of the refugees can be taken along with them.I've talked with several members of various special operations groups and they indicate that just grabbing the woman and the other folks they are there to extract (perhaps knocking them out in the process to make the extraction easier) would have been a quicker method, but it's fine. I'm willing to buy it for the story.The film is actually pretty good and becomes really good when Willis' character proceeds to leave all of the refugees at the LZ where the extraction will take place and just brings along the doctor. I suppose the movie could have ended there (although it would have been rather short) and I would have liked the film a bit more. But, instead, Willis turns the helicopters around and goes back to help the ailing Nigerians.OK, so you have the plot to that point and I won't spoil the rest of the film for you if you are intent on watching it.I like action films where people are killed and lots of stuff blows up. There is a bit of both in this film. The only problem is that the film is laced with melodrama. All of the deaths look like they personally affect the members of the Special Operations group. Not to put too blunt a point on the subject, but in theory, it's not a good thing for death to affect you in any way if you are in the military. Afterwards, when you are in base camp or on board a ship, you can drink a gallon of Jack Daniel's or whatever to forget your problems, but if you let if affect you during the mission, it will cause problems.--Minor Spoiler-- I suppose the problems are shown in the film in that most of the cast is killed during the 'rescue' operation. About 3/4ths of the SOG is taken out before they finally finish the mission. It's nice the Willis makes it, but still ... I would rather see him drinking on board an aircraft carrier after a successful mission instead of getting shot several times helping people who were pretty much doomed to begin with.Oh, and yeah, apparently the sun can cry. I never really understood the title and watching the film a couple of times never let me understand it very much. Perhaps there is some hidden African meaning within the film, but if there is it is so subtle that it's not there.I gave this film a 6 because it had Bruce Willis and lots of stuff that blew up. If it was another actor, it would have been a 3 or 4, and if stuff didn't blow up, it'd be a 1 or a 2. This is definitely a rental movie, not a purchase.",Tears of the Sun

The reason for the extraction is that the Royal family has all been assassinated and rebels are running amuck killing everyone.Willis plays a very stoic leader of the team who seems to perform his mission without any emotion.  The female doctor will not leave the mission without taking with her all of the inhabitants who can travel.  They have to get to a landing zone where the helicopters can land and extract the doctor. Obviously there is not enough room on board the helicopters for all of the locals and Willis has to force the doctor on board because she will not leave her people willingly.  He also makes it clear to the good doctor that his mission is to extract her and no one else.  However once airborne emotion creeps into Willis's psyche and he has to acknowledge that if he leaves all of the people there they surely will all be killed.  So he has the helicopters turn back and the rest of the movie is about the Seals and their mission to get the locals to a safe haven.This is a very strong movie.  It seems to me to be a statement movie regarding the situation in Iraq right now.  Unless we do something Saddam Hussein will be allowed to continue to torture and murder people in Iraq. The time has come for us to act.This movie is an extremely emotional movie at times and I had a headache from shedding so many tears.

It doesn't start out that way; it starts out as a job, and only when they see the extent of the atrocities perpetrated on their fellow human beings do they realize that they can't simply walk away.  As Cole Hauser's character, Red, puts it in the film ""I simply can't see them as 'packages' anymore.""That is what gives this story its power, and its integrity.  We come to care about these characters because they come to care for others; they become, in essence, ""their brother's keeper.""  Some things about the film may require some stretch of the imagination -- Bruce Willis may be the world's oldest living SEAL lieutenant -- but his talent, and his clear emotional investment in the role make him not only believable, but heroic. 
OK; now for the more-or-less political soapbox.I strongly suspect, that in light of the current international situation, this movie will be VERY controversial, and will gather plenty of 3s and 4s (or less).

Having known the premise of the film from watching the commercials I could've came in 30 minutes after the movie started and not have missed too many important details. There are some tense moments during this time while they are traveling through the jungle but it really doesn't set the pace for the movie.Once the movie really begins, however, it takes off and becomes quite exciting. Bruce Willis and his team don't even fire a shot until a crucial moment when he must decide between saving a small village or go around it to complete his mission...The viewer is given a realistic portrayal of combat with accurate depictions of combat maneuvers not seen very often in the movies. The brutality of war is depicted up-close and brings the viewer to near tears in a few scenes. The SEALs in this film are also depicted well enough with a great cast to support their leader, played by Bruce Willis. The team members are balanced in the sense that each of them is crucial to the operations. There is a point-man/scout, an explosives expert, a person in charge of monitoring enemy movement and a ""Doc"" to mention a few. They are likeable characters and I hope to see more of these new actors in future movies.There is more to this story than ""save the doctor and go home"". The person actually being saved isn't revealed until much later in the film. It is a believable sub-plot that works well with the story.The movie also does not fall into a romantic pitfall between the female and male lead. Additionally, it doesn't succumb to a final scene with the leader of the enemy fighting Bruce Willis in hand-to-hand combat.

229,jay_d_h,"excellent acting, far fetched plot, action packed-some spoilers",8,25 August 2003,"I loved this movie. Its compared to black hawk down a lot due to the geographic similarities, but blackhawk down is a true story and this is not. Could it be a true story? Highly unlikely. I doubt the military would send navy seals to rescue one american doctor. Maybe if they made the doctor the daughter of a high official, but she seems like an ordinary woman who wouldn't attract the attention of the governements most elite special forces unit. That said, I think the actions of Willis' character are believable. He's never failed a mission and always does them without feeling. He lets himself care one time, because of the atrocities he sees, and of course because you can't have a 30 minute movie, and decides to go back and save more of the refugees. I'm sure he loses his position as a result of it and he's probably given some desk duty, but we don't see that part. So once the plot gets going I think its very believable. The firefights seem very realistic, with the exception of the ""move forward predictably in a straight line and shoot straight ahead"" actions of the soldiers. Look at heat for example, the big scene in the end is so well done because the robbers are skilled, they fire random burst in all directions to keep everyone pinned down. These are known engagements tactics not employed in the movie that I'm sure special forces are trained to use.The acting is VERY good. There are many no name african american actors in this movie who are quite simply amazing and the director is smart enough to let them take center stage at the right moments. They do overdue the america cares propaganda message a little too much, but I think its more about Willis' character caring than anything else, since his commander could care less about the refugees. You have to show the refugees and atrocities to show what willis is seeing and to support his decision to go back and save them. I also like the realism of the command structure. Whether or not the team agrees with Willis they go along without a word unless he requests their advice. Any other movie would have some stereotypical soldier who disagrees with everything willis does. I also like the fact that the typical love story I was expecting is avoided.There are some great action scenes throughout this movie, the sound is phenomenal and a good dolby digital setup will really shine with this movie. Bullets wizz all around you, explosions shake the room, birds chirp behind you, etc. Its a very exciting movie, and emotinally draining. Its everything an action movie should be.Blackhawk down is more realistic because its true and because it does not overdue the progranda. Its a movie about soldiers. I think Tears of the sun is a movie made to show the atrocities that occurred in african and the difference the U.S. could make if they would intervene more. It has the same message found in No Man's Land. By choosing neutrality and inaction you are in fact choosing to help the side of the aggressor. You cannot remain neutral, this is what willis' character realizes and why he acts the way he does. The actions of the spy in the middle of the movie hint to this, when he says ""I didn't kill anyone"", the LT says ""yes you did"".",Tears of the Sun

235,libertyinprogress,"By far, one of my favorite movies of all time",9,5 June 2018,"I originally watched ""Tears of the Sun"" with some friends in 2003, when it was officially released in theaters. I was still pretty young, at the time (16 years old, still in high school), so my knowledge of war and conflict was pretty bleak. Also, this was literally right around, or before, March 20th, which is when the US waged the War In Iraq. I'm not sure if this was just pure coincidence by the Director, Antoine Fuqua, but it happened to line up almost to the day of one of the biggest wars in American history.Since I was pretty uneducated on what war was back then, the movie really opened my eyes to the brutality of it all, and that only further peaked my interest. One thing I loved was the realness of how the characters interacted with one another, calling each other by nicknames, remaining very stoic in their mannerisms and how they speak, and of course, how they acted like real Navy SEALs, who are known to be some of the toughest members of any branch of the military, because of the particular type of training they go through. I also thought the battle scenes, where both sides are fighting one another, or a sniper is shooting the enemy from a long distance, seemed realistic, and definitely keep me on the edge of my seat. It's not easy to choreograph this kind of stuff, so it looked really convincing to me.After initially watching the movie in 2003, I had gone several years not seeing it, again, until it was shown on a premium movie channel, which lead to me watching the movie multiple times after that on cable television. I loved the movie so much after seeing it so many times that I decided to buy the DVD, then I kept watching it on DVD, or seeing it shown on cable television. To this day, I still watch ""Tears of the Sun"" when it airs, and enjoy it, just as much as I always did.As for the movie, itself, it's a very harrowing story of eight Navy SEALs, who are forced to rescue an American doctor (by marriage), two nuns and a priest out of a village in Nigeria, so as to bring them to safety in Cameroon. Unfortunately, this team of SEALS had just completed a difficult mission, but this next one was expected to be simple and quick. The team is headed by Lieutenant A.K. Waters, nicknamed ""LT"" (Bruce Willis), with seven other SEALs: James Atkins, nicknamed ""Red"" (Cole Hauser); Ellis Pettigrew, nicknamed ""Zee (Eamonn Walker); Kelly Lake (Johnny Messner), referred to by his last name, Lake; Michael Slowenski, nicknamed ""Slo"" (Nick Chinlund); Demetrius Owens, nicknamed ""Silk"" (Charles Ingram); Danny Kelley, nicknamed ""Doc"" (Paul Francis); Jason Mabry, nicknamed ""Flea"" (Chad Smith).Without giving away too much about the film, there are two aspects of this movie, which involve the plot, that have always stood out to me the most: one is positive and the other is negative.The positive I noticed is how the movie reminds people that members of the military, whose job it is to kill their enemies with bullets and bombs, can also be humane enough to save people's lives, as well. In other words, not all men/women with guns are bad, just because they are involved in acts of violence. They are meant to be in those situations, because they are on a mission to save people from danger, just like a police officer and a firefighter would do. It also shows that people, who live in poorer countries, like Nigeria, Cameroon, etc., are still human beings, and should be treated as such, instead of ""packages,"" as one of the characters refuses to look at them in that way. Many emotional moments in this film depict what African people go through, when it comes to fascist and tyrannical regimes that oppress their people.Now, when it comes to the negative, I thought it was a little bit of a bad touch to show how there's a war between two huge religious sects, depicting one as being worse than the other. In this case, Fuqua chose to show how the Christian Egbo people (referred to in the movie as the ""Egbo Nation"") are being victimized and slaughtered in a military coup, backed by a Muslim Fula military General, who has hundreds of thousands of troops at his service. The issue I have with this is that the movie is unfairly portraying Muslims as more violent and extreme, which is a religious stereotype that certain populations throughout the world are convinced is true. In reality, more than a majority of Muslims are peaceful, and aren't in favor of killing people from other religions, as much as the Qu'ran states. The extremists in any religion are going to be violent, regardless of the fact that they're part of any of the Abrahamic religions: Muslim, Jewish or Christian.Even with that little negative aspect of the film, ""Tears of the Sun"" will always be a favorite of mine, and I'd pretty much watch it whenever I have the chance.

Wow, I was totally wrong, and what I saw, was just amazing. I was so touched by the drama and incredible footage in this film. I am excited to see what this movie will do at the Academy Awards. An extremely well put together movie that truly touches your soul. We don't realize just how good we have it until you see this movie. The amazing training of our military also portrays what our brave men and women have to sacrifice to save our country and protect others. I had a knot in my throat through out the whole movie, it was very emotional and truly authentic. Great job Bruce Willis, this movie will proudly join my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie and hope that EVERYONE gets a chance to watch it on the BIG SCREEN, before it's gone. You will not be disappointed.",Tears of the Sun
239,Rosa109-1,Absolutely Loved This Film,10,1 July 2006,I found this movie to be a very sad but great film I don't really do military films but this one was a must see it's in my boyfriend's top 10 movies of all time and I see why. This movie touches you from the start to the finish. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is not afraid to shed a tear or two it's a deep film that leaves you feeling so many emotions at once.I believe the actors in this film were outstanding and I would truly urge everyone to give this movie a chance even if your not into all of these military movies this one is definitely worth seeing and owning. this movie is definitely making my top 10 there was no over-acting going on and it was all so real only a heartless person wouldn't like this movie.

240,cm_samuels,For Our Sins,10,5 October 2006,"I spent an hour surfing the Internet, to gather viewer objections to Tears of the Sun.Most are parochial objections to scene specific details, such as the time displayed on CPT Rhodes watch, the length of LT Waters beard, the lack of caked on dirt on Dr. Kendricks or Patients, CPT Rhodes utilizing a cellular handset or standing next to the LSO platform without cranial headgear.Perhaps the carrier moved into a new timezone and CPT Rhodes changed his watch to reflect local time. Perhaps LT Waters shaves in the field, as opportunity permits. Perhaps the 2 ladies not being forced to crawl around as snakes, take care to remain as clean as possible. Perhaps a handset is scrambled & convenient. Perhaps CPT Rhodes talks to the LSO station staff to assess the potential for air-support.Other objections are to military procedure that viewers are not trained to recognize. Many viewers assume that LT Waters would be court marshaled and ejected from the military for disobeying direct orders. On the contrary, such a LT may be highly awarded for proper initiative in the face of dire circumstances.Helicopter pilots would divert from a covert pick-up path to overfly the mission, as the burning & smoke would be obviously visible from the air. Helicopters may not land at the mission as space is insufficient and to do so and prior to the death of the noncombatants would destroy the covert nature of the mission. A HALO insertion is the quickest and most covert way for a boatcrew to arrive at the mission.LT Waters knows *why* and probably *who* committed the slaughter at the mission, and at that point he is starting to care. He chooses to extend the duration of the mission as the Articles of the Geneva Convention on Warfare have probably been violated, coupled with his sense of outrage. At that point there is no reason for LT Waters to suspect that a Rebel Army unit will be in pursuit of his boatcrew.LT Waters chooses to not send Dr. Kendricks directly to the aircraftcarrier at the first available instant, as the very young & old or sick must be granted priority for airlift to slow the marching group as little as possible. He chooses not to immediately ditch the refugees, as those not lifted out on the helicopter travel no slower than the doctor and the moral issue is then in play.His decision to engage at the genocide village is spot on. If he *did not* engage, THAT would have been grounds for a Trial by Court Martial. The Articles of the Geneva Convention on Warfare were clearly being violated in his presence. After that engagement as the LT views the hellish scene, his decision to extend the mission as an ad hoc ground reconnaissance in addition to a VIP extraction is vindicated.LT Waters is an educated man, and a dedicated SPECWARior. He is confident in his ability to assess & direct his boatcrew without explanation. His apparent age and comparative low rank is easily explained. LT Waters is a mustang, a former enlisted man with an education that is then commissioned.CPT Rhodes is not a commander of an aircraftcarrier, he is a SPECWAR officer. Africa is an open air museum chock full of Soviet Era weaponry such as antiaircraft artillery, rocket propelled grenades, and shoulder fired surface to air missiles. That would hinder helicopter extraction once an American military presence on the ground in Nigeria was detected.The final fight scene is not a retrograde movement to the border. Lake describes to LT Waters, doubling back, crossing the river downstream and approaching the pass. During the final engagement the boatcrew crosses the river a second time, then angles northeast to arrive at the border of Cameroon.As I see it there are 3 real mistakes. Lake says ""sir"" to Zee, very unlikely and Zee does not then follow up by shooting Lake a dirty look. Lake is treated for his shoulder wound in a kill zone of a sniper. The F/A18s are at first displayed without ordnance.Beyond those 3 minor blemishes, Tears of the Sun is a masterpiece of gritty realism.",Tears of the Sun

Otherwise, don't waste your time. I am always interested in war movies because I think that if they are done well, they can TEACH us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war.  This film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside, saying whorrible cliche lines, doing the most predictable things, and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed.  This film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the United States of America!  Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or any other country and watching this, being told that this is how Americans truly are?  No wonder everyone hates us!

We being Americans really don't have an idea of the brutality that exists in other parts of the world.The other important element of the movie involves a man that regains his humanity. While this theme has been exploited to the point of being cliche, it still works OK here.

Two words, S T A Y  A W A Y !!!!",Tears of the Sun
245,R-Flagg,A fine film for Willis ...,7,8 March 2003,"This review may be seen to contain spoilers, so be warned.The first 90 minutes of this film are great ... not 10 out of 10 great, but a solid 8.  Willis is really firm in this role ... the non-speaking moments are strong, and all of his supporting ""S.E.A.L."" team (actors) deserve credit too.The basic story is rather predictable, and any suspense that might have been built up for the final scene was destroyed before I even entered the theatre by the idiots in Hollywood that insist on putting scenes from the last 5 minutes of the film into the trailers.  I guess I have come to expect this, so I will only suggest that if you like Action / Drama / Adventure films, try NOT to see the ads before seeing the film.  (Okay, I will get off my soapbox now.)Willis is strong throughout, even though he has very little dialogue in much of the movie.  The situation (explained in the first few minutes of the film) eventually pushes his character beyond a limit even he does not completely understand, and something instinctual takes over.  The brilliance of this film is in NOT explaining it any more than that (and I will try to follow suit).Another aspect I liked was the lack of animosity between Willis and his commander who is understandably upset when he hears of the change in plans. Rather than the typical ""obey your orders"" rant we might expect in that situation, the commander is hot but understanding and even compassionate. It was a refreshing bit of humanity.The place where humanity is lacking is in the whole nature of the background conflict.  Willis and his SEAL team are not there to fight the war and in fact are not even to engage the enemy unless fired upon, but when faced with the cruellest and harshest elements of the horrors of war (genocide, torture) something changes, and they respond.The question for Willis and his men is obvious ... follow orders or do ""the right thing"", but the answer is not so clear.  There are hints of other motives as well.  Perhaps Willis is smitten by his ""package"", the good Doctor Hendricks (Bellucci), an American widow who is every bit as independent and motivated as he is, (but for some reason cannot keep her blouse buttoned).  Or perhaps there are some other ""sins"" for which Willis is attempting to atone.  As the movie progresses, others of the SEAL team find their own motives, conflicts and resolutions challenged as well.The unfortunate part of the film comes in the final half hour.  It feels like someone flipped a switch and instead of getting an ""against all odds"" dramatic conflict where skill, wit, technology and even some good-old American ""True Grit"" bring them through, we have a bloodbath battle and a pyrotechnic ""here comes the Calvary"" scene that really drops the hole movie down a notch.What should have been a solid 8 and even a 9 with a good ending, ends up at a 7, and that only because of my respect for Willis' acting and the editing of the first part of the film.Best line: ""For our sins."" Rating: 7 / 10",Tears of the Sun
246,nickyt187,Let me educate you about this film!,5,26 January 2012,"After spending some time reading a lot of the user reviews on this film I find myself shaking my head at all these people who clearly have no idea about most of the content in this film.I come from a family that consists of Military Operaters that range from a Green Beret to a Navy Seal who have fought in the Vietnam era to the Afganistan era so I just might know a thing or two about them. I would like to pass this knowledge on to you.What you need to know is that these men are not ""Soldiers"" or ""The Army"" as most of you refer to them as. These men are US Navy SEALs which is the most highly trained and feared military unit in the world. They are part of the US Special Operations Community which are tasked with extremely risky and dangerous missions that include what we see in Tears Of The Sun. They are the 1st troops into a combat zone well before the ""Army and Marines"" arrive. Special Operations is a highly exclusive community in the US Military and should not be regarded as traditional Military personnel. When they operate they do not have massive military units to back them up they are alone. Frequently without support from air, artillery, medivac and resupply. They are in charge of how they complete their mission and must alter game plans when situations change. So for those of you who say ""A seasoned LT. would not disobey orders"" he just might given the situation on hand. Special Operations members are taught to ""think for themselves"" not to just take orders which at large makes them who they are.Of course this is a movie and like any other movie depicting situations involving combat they make mistakes. This film does a good job keeping many typical mistakes and clichés at a minimum. The only real mistakes I saw were during the climax when the FA18 provided CAS for the SEALs. Both jets were seen taking off without ordnance and then as they approach the target they then have only air to air missile loaded which could not have created the explosions seen. The SEALs also do not use cover as much as they should have during the firefights. Common mistakes that are normally seen are the need to never reload when engaging targets this movie does a good job making sure that doesn't happen. The actors do a good job acting as a unit and making fall back maneuvers as well as handling there weapons in the proper way an operator would.Some of you had said that this is ""just another American propaganda film"" or ""Why cant a whole army kill 7 Soldiers"". From what I see a large number of these negative comments are made by those that live outside the US. I understand views other countries have on America. I myself am disgusted in the way some things are done and run here as well.But you need to understand that movies such as Black Hawk Down and this are not a reflection of America as a whole. They reflect on those few individuals who do extraordinary things against impossible odds and then go out and do it all over again with no recognition. These movies are not propaganda these are films that recognize individuals for the things they do. The extraordinary things these men do are not for their country, they do it for strangers and each others.The odds these SEALs face which some find unrealistic have been played out in history with outcomes similar to this movie. So before you say unrealistic why don't you give these guys some credit and look at the facts. The difference between them and the hundreds of enemy soldiers is simple. The enemy has only known one kind of war, the genocide kind which in my opinion isn't a war when your enemy has already dug his grave and is just waiting for you to execute him. They are young, inexperienced and have little to no training with weapons and tactics. SEALs train for all types of scenarios and spend most of their time educating themselves and learning from their mistakes. Seals are combat veterans that operate in all enviorments in all hemispheres of the world. For those of you who mention Black Hawk Down I have an example for you. Remember the two Delta Force Snipers that soley protected a downed Black Hawk from a crowd in the hundreds? Well guess what that really happened and yes they did die protecting their friend but they killed about a hundred Somali militia in the process without any support.So before we call it unrealistic lets give these guys the benefit of the doubt.Overall I would recommend this film to everyone. It is what it is, a Hollywod action/war picture that depicts current events that happen all over the world and have been for some time. It blends a mix of action, drama and conflict very well. Without stretching the boundaries of what is real and what is unrealistic. You will find some clichés in this film but not many. The acting is good (not great) for the most part with small amounts of character development, however you can still make a connection with the characters. I felt that this film did a great job in all aspects. The plot was good and believable, depictions of the SEALS was done well, firefight scenes were done realistically, Setting was awesome and the climax and closing were done right leaving you with a good taste in your mouth. I gave this film an 8/10 rating due to its minor errors as described above.Enjoy your film folk's!",Tears of the Sun
247,addanhour,This film is important because the very real threat some Africans face today.,8,29 October 2005,"Not being one for ""War"" movies I was intrigued by a short clip that I saw on FX TV. Without spoiling the film beyond what others have said I will say that the transformation of, the 'LT', Willis's character is pivotal to the film. A SEAL in the Navy 'LT' is use to just following orders and completing the mission. He does whatever is needed to get the job done and doesn't think about the consequences of his or his unit's actions.This all changes when he sent to retrieve American citizens, a doctor, a priest and two nuns in civil war-torn Nigeria. The cleric and the nuns opt to stay behind and tend to injured civilians in a small village. The doctor refuses to leave unless she can take some 70 people that are able to walk. The 'LT' agrees but has no intention of evacuating the civilians because his orders were for Americans only. After evacuating the doctor via helicopter the flight takes the SEALs over the evacuated village which has since been ethnically cleansed. Orders be damned, he turns the 'copters back to retrieve some of the very young and very old villagers that he had callously abandoned. They get airlifted to safety and 'LT', his men, the doctor and the rest of the villagers make a mad dash for the Cameroon border all the while being pursued by rebellious troops and a genocidal Colonel.This film is important because it brings into focus to American audiences the very real threat that many African people live under today. We in the West, pick and choose which battles we are willing to fight and which we will turn our backs on. Meanwhile genocide and ethnic cleansing goes on.I recently met some people from Nigeria and they told me that some of the atrocities are portrayed in this film are true. They also told me that their government is almost always in turmoil and whichever political party is in power at any given time is generally guilty of tribal ethnic cleansing. I highly recommend this film for about the first hour and a half. The issues dealt with are thought provoking and make good discussion subjects afterward. The Pro-USA ending is an insult to reality. Some reviewers of ""Tears of the SUN"" have called the film 'sappy', but it is only this last part that is really over the top. I give this film 8 out of 10 stars for its realistic portions in the first 1:30 min. the rest is flag waving drivel that drags down this otherwise excellent film.The cinematography in the first half of this film is quite stunning.",Tears of the Sun

Antoine Fuqua is by far a genius in his own right how many directors do you know win an academy award for their first films(training day). the chemistry between Willis and belluci is by far rare to find these days. the formula Fuqua used was original and very well thought out. you couldn't help but feel for the navy seals. now if only the military in real life could be more understanding like these men though its hard at times to make a decision like this. the ethnic cleansing scenes were in a word intense i couldn't even look at the film during the scene with the mother and the baby.

Also, in the US army first battle with the rebels in the village, US didn't have casualty nor even wounded, Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks are too showing off in this movie, for example, the so-called doctor keep the spy in the US army and didn't reported to lieutenant which contradict the fact that she wanted to save her own people. and when she told about her husband she said ""he tried to protect me but he couldn't"" I was like ""what?"" Then how the f*** she survived? and in the f***n battle, Lieutenant didn't set any plan but had stupid conversation with that doctor. There was no opinion about killing people in this movie, but there is only stupid rambling. soldiers are not moving themselves in reasonable situation but they are moving by elementary school level moral. In the structure of this movie, the things are going too fast and not showing people's emotion or thought, only f*** boring travel.

256,pdt1978,Doing the right thing without a Stars and Stripes to be seen,8,23 August 2005,"While it's far from classical film making I was quite surprised by how good I found this movie. My partner and I have both spent some time working in Africa and she has a special interest in human rights and humanitarian intervention. When we saw the preview for this movie we both let out audible groans and eyes were rolled aplenty: America saves everyone...again. The movie was immediately consigned to the ""I wouldn't watch that if you paid me bin..."" but we did watch it and we quite enjoyed it.Aside from the slightly too sexual relationship between Willis and the doctor (they almost kiss - simply no need) the movie runs along pretty well and was by turns very tense, exciting and fairly moving.Most importantly I felt it provided a thought provoking picture of what ethnic cleansing might really be like, something that film makers hesitate to explore. War time atrocities are one of those things that we all have a fair idea about but that are rarely portrayed. This movie did a VERY good job of describing awful atrocities without being overly gory or, worse, sensationalist and the use of humiliation and subordination as a weapon was subtly demonstrated.Technical aspects aside the soldiers were convincingly concerned about the refugees without overt ""We're all such goddamn heroes, aren't we?"" posturing. All the major clichés were utterly avoided, not a single stars and stripes to be seen, not even the remotest hint of patriotic zeal, no mournful brass sections but plenty of Hans ""I really need some new material after Gladiator"" Zimmer's African melodies. The violence was visceral without being excessively bloody or stylised, and there was a sentimentality that deftly avoided being cheesy.Most importantly Bruce Willis managed to avoid being Bruce Willis for 80% of the time.The nearest thing I would compare this movie to is Black Hawk Down. However, BHD is wedged firmly in the action genre and this really isn't. Yup, there is shooting and violence in it but it manages to not be about that, which I think is a great thing.My advice: grab the DVD version, watch the movie, then watch the trailer/previews included on the disk - you'll wonder if you were watching the same film, the trailer just does not do it justice.",Tears of the Sun
257,paleok,Uninteresting Take on the White Man's Burden,3,28 June 2007,"As an action film, there is not much action. As a war film there is no esprits de corps. As a message film it just falls flat. It has become a custom in Hollywood to make films on the turmoil in African staring white Americans (see Blood Diamond). Yet, into In what is supposed to be a call of arm for Western Nations to help the native peoples of Africa, you get either the hapless native or the inept, bloodthirsty, monstrous savage. In steps the glorious white man (the Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci characters). They alone can solve the problems in Africa and stand the African peoples up for there true (read western) destiny. And if that was not enough, there is a little white man's guilt thrown in for good measure. This is how Hollywood sells the problem to the general public. The take home message is that we must go to war to stop these people from hurting themselves. Seems easy enough until you realize Western powers don't do so well when the interfere in local conflicts (or provoke them in the case of Iraq). See Black Hawk Down for the result of our meddling or for a movie on how Africa has taken to slaughtering itself see Hotel Rowanda. While these two movies have their own flaws, at least they are better written.Yes, genocide must be stopped and the West must be willing to provide the force to stop when diplomacy fails but for once I would like to see a movie that deals with the wars, children soldiers, etc. that did not resort to cheap gimmicks.",Tears of the Sun

The fact that just 1 man's right turn can change a group of people's destiny forever is just magnificent to watch to an extent that you feel you are in the movie itself. The Choice for Bruce Willis and Monica Belucci was the best in my opinion.The movie in short just has everything in place, the soundtrack was just beautiful(beautiful being an understatement!). There are a few strong, had to take scenes which in all makes the movie more interesting and appreciable for what the idea portrays. So many scene-stealing and touching performances by the actors/actresses involved that at the end i felt truly that ""the only reason for evil to succeed is for the good men to do nothing!"".

What action you see is designed for shock value alone and again is aimed at teaching you the circumstances that existed.

All the old cliché's,9,17 June 2008,"Except for the overuse of taking The Lord's Name in vain and more than enough F-words, this is a fine movie that holds your interest throughout. Hardly a dead moment in the entire 2+ hours. The producers, directors & actors took A LOT of Hollywood war-movie cliché's and applied them to this film with the same expertise that Frank Lloyd Wright applied construction cliché's like glass and rough stone and came up with a masterpiece. We have the hard-bitten veteran officer (Willis) with the weight of each mission and man in the platoon on his shoulders. We also have the reliable African-American non-com who takes the most-moral stance of all the Commandoes and makes the big sacrifice for his comrades. There's also the reluctant, incredulous ""war is not the answer"" civilians who have no stomach or appreciation for the hard realities of combat or what can be accomplished by killing the bad guys. There's also the hard moral decision the feet-on-the-ground officer must make and defy his superiors' orders in doing so. Also included is the reluctant enlisted man who is against the whole extra-curricular activity who ends up making the big sacrifices toward the end. But it never seems like a clichéd performance with these elements added in. The script gives as accurate a portrayal of the overthrow of the Nigerian democratically-elected government by rebel Muslim elements from the north and doesn't shrink from showing exactly what happened...no cowardly political correctness here.

However I found the first half of the movie very dry.  I wanted to see a fight so badly I was getting impatient.  The movie is portrayed as an action film, the only thing is you really have to wait for the action.  Once the fighting begins it is very tense and realistic. The final war scene was totally excellent!Other then a few dry plot lines and a few over used clichés, all in all it was pretty good.",Tears of the Sun
264,sir_aydin,One of the best films of the year,9,8 September 2005,"Tears of the Sun Bruce Willis plays the leader of a NAVY Seals team assigned to rescue Monica Belucci from a dangerous area of Nigeria during an armed rebellion in which ethnic cleansing is being practised on the Ebo. Rather than leaving with the team, Monica Belucci chooses to stay and the team stays behind to help escort them to the border with Cameroon.------------------------ Tears of the Sun is an enigma, starring big name Bruce Willis and directed by new big time director Antoine Fuqua it is relatively unknown. The plot may not be anything special, and the script may not allow for the full development of the characters in this film, but its strengths lay in the stomach churning ethnic cleansing taking place in front of the soldiers and the bond it develops between viewer and the Seals / Africans. The road to the border leaves the viewer fraught with tension as the violence escalates towards the crescendo toward the end. As a drama AND as an action film, this film succeeds on all counts. Where it succeeds in relation to the recent glut of awful action movies is its reluctance to get too hung up on any form of sentimentality or cliché. There are several unexpected moments, and the cheesiness is close to zero save for a couple of moments near the end. Bruce Willis and Monica Beluccin do a good job, but it is the strength in depth that makes this film so special. Eamonn Walker is brilliant, Cole Hauser is probably in his best part yet, and lastly the always impressive Nick Chinlund really hits a chord even if his part is limited. One of the best films of the year. If you get a chance to see it, don't miss out!Rating: 9/10",Tears of the Sun
265,Saber0307,A Realistic Action Flic,8,24 March 2003,"This was a pretty good movie. Unlike most modern day action movies which are pretty unrealistic, this one was pretty realistic. Also, which was a surprise, there isnt much gore. There is only one scene of mass gore, but you dont see much. That scene while not haveing much gore, is pretty impactfull because you know what happend to the person and it makes you sick. The characters are not developed at all at the begining of the story, but as the story progresses you start likeing them. I think they were a bit underdeveloped, but thats just me. I'm also surprised because in the first hour there isnt much dialouge as there is in other movies. This includes Bruce Willis. He doesnt have an assload of lines like we would expect when a big hollywood actor is cast in a movie. I would highly recomend you seeing this movie. 4/5",Tears of the Sun

To those who say, there is no way a platoon could fend off 5,000 like that, guess again.  True, on several occasions during the final battle the SEALs were just sitting in the open, but that was more a function of being able to see them while shooting as opposed to how they would actually fight.  The tactics they used were quite well done and very cohesive.  (There were a number of interesting military/procedural/for the sake of a movie screw ups, I'll list as many as I remember in the goofs section.)Over all, a good action movie.

272,Serendipity522,A Movie made with Passion and Conviction,8,15 July 2003,"It is refreshing, although ironically sickening that an awareness of the desecration of humanity in Africa is steadily reaching Hollywood.  More and more films are being birthed now from a director's or actors passion to tell the story.  This is one such film.  I watched the making of ""Tears of the Sun"" and was moved by Antoine Fuqua's objective for making this film. Bruce Willis also shared that vision, and as well incorporated actors & actresses that shared that same vision.  Antoine's insistence to only use extras who experienced such horror only adds to the authenticity of film making and I'm sure was of an emotional cleansing for those extras.The movie slowed a bit when the group was making it's way across the rainforest.  But the decision to avoid developing the love story between Lt. Waters & Dr. Kendrick was a wise one.  They instead used the emotion of the eyes to convey that there was a bond developing between these two characters instead of stripping down and having sex.  I had a greater appreciation for the Navy Seals and for their job that I'm sure due to the high security of their missions goes unrecognized.I enjoyed this movie and although glossified for entertainment, the palette of boys who played the team of Navy Seals, to me it pulled those heart strings and did leave me thinking...What can I do?  I think that was what Antoine Fuqua wanted, to raise awareness.  And although Africa is by far not the only nation suffering such inhumanity, it does raise the bar of film making.",Tears of the Sun

275,stwolfgang,A truly modern war epic,10,28 February 2004,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** For all the negative comments and low ratings, you'd assume this film was your run of the mill action flicks trying to make a point, a recontrived version of Executive Decision or On Deadly Ground.  After reading many reviewer's comments on this movie and others, I am perplexed by the seeming double standard.  Criticisms of this movie range from camera angles, close up shots, musical score and lack of character development.  Yet when it comes to cheesecake action flicks of the 80's and early 90's, B-movies and implausible horror films, we're encouraged to just check our brains at the door.As far as the shortfalls of this movie, there are a few.  The character development is weak.  Overall I would have liked to see the SEALs and migrants developed better.  But in this case, it also serves a source of strength.  The full story of the character's life does not HAVE to be known in order for them to be understood.  Often when directors try to further the viewer's understanding it serves to slow the film considerably.  In TOTS, Fuqua avoids this by purposely not delving into personal details.  This decision also serves a greater purpose.  Not knowing each person's favorite flavor of bubble gum and their hometown makes them more believable in terms of their profession.I also found the film to be well paced.  Their is constant action throughout the film to varying degrees and none of it is outrageously conceived.  The particular genius of this film is that the viewer can nearly feel the level of indecision and personal doubt of the SEALs.  This is pulled off by making Willis' character as unsure of his actions and motives himself rather than turning him into the oft cliched morally altruistic leader popular in similar films.  Willis' character struggles with his choices throughout the film.  He can make a grossly unprofessional decision above his pay grade which places his team and mission at risk for what can at best be called a morally vague calling; or he can retain his professionalism by fully completing his mission while risking a more troubled conscience.  Unlike most film situations, this is a much hazier call.Another poignant aspect of this film is that it captures what modern warfare has become.  The film does not pit the heroes against a government or a terrorist organization, but against idealists.  This parallels the decision in modern warfare from the large scale decision of governments to go to war to the foggy nature of decision making on the ground level for the 'boots.'
As for the criticisms of directorial artistry, I'll leave style choices to the director.  The idea is that Fuqua got the point across, I can't condemn this movie based on his choice of camera angles or costume style.  Fuqua does an excellent job not of merely showing the atrocities of war, but of showing the impact on normal human outsiders.  It is also important to point out just how technically sound this movie is.  From tactically sound maneuvers to realistic equipment loads, TOTS hits the technicalities on the head other films ignore.Overall, this movie is a morally haze filled tale of nearly anonymous characters who are short on rhetorical dialog and who unceremoniously, without a grand prelude or benefit of sharing their final words of wisdom. In other words, this film is starkly real.",Tears of the Sun
276,TonyD63,Powerful yet uninspired anti-war statement,6,27 September 2003,"The gritty and rather bloody newsreel style opening sets the scene - it's Nigeria, the country is in chaos after a brutal Islamic dictator has seized power and started to ethnically cleanse the Christians from the country. The presidential family has been massacred, and an American doctor (Monica Bellucci), together with an assortment of Christian missionaries must be safely removed from the country.Into this foreign bloodbath steps Bruce Willis, a Lieutenant in the US Army, and his crew of bad-ass GIs who must secretly enter the country to rescue Miss Bellucci and generally kick some ass. And that's exactly what they do. In a film which boasts a body count as spectacular as the African setting in which it takes place, few of the horrors of war are left to the imagination as rape, torture and beheading all figure strongly in the film. No where near as graphic as Saving Private Ryan, but strong stuff nevertheless.Clearly director Antoine Fuqua had no art house pretensions here, which means character development takes a back seat as a decent supporting cast are allowed to do little more than repeat their lines. The sharp-eyed will recognise Nick Chinlund who shakes off his bad-boy image in Con Air to play one of Willis' good-guy GI sidekicks. The rest of Willis' crew growl, look menacing and offer the obligatory macho expletives, before offering themselves up as cannon fodder for the inevitable blood-fest in the final dramatic reel.Willis, in a typically understated performance, does pretty well as the war-weary veteran who finally decides to do the ""right thing"" rather than just mindlessly follow orders from his superior officer (played by Tom Skerritt in little more than a cameo role). But his performance lacks any real passion and his character fails to show the emotion demanded by the horrors he is surrounded by. Bellucci flutters her eyelashes and wails and screams at Willis at the appropriate moments, but you always know that they will finish in each other's arms at the end of the movie - and so it proves.
And sadly this is the film's main weakness. The entire plot is so predictable from beginning to end that you could be forgiven for thinking that you have seen it all before - which you probably have. From the initial friction between Willis and Bellucci, giving way to grudging respect, and then finally affection, to the jungle chase scenes and action set-pieces, it's all formula driven stuff with nothing new offered or implied. The two leads do what they can to make it work, but devoid of any real suspense or sense of menace, it's hard to really empathise with the characters or worry about their fate.And yet for all that Tears of the Sun is by no means a bad movie. The stars are solid enough, the supporting cast enthusiastic, the action scenes well handled, and the upbeat ending will please those that like their movies to end that way. A pounding score accompanies the closing credits but could have been used to better effect during the film. Short on suspense and originality maybe, but by showing the horrors of ethnic cleansing so graphically it sends a powerful anti-war message which few would doubt has a particular resonance for our time. And that is surely no bad thing.",Tears of the Sun

One of the things I liked about it was that it made me think deeply about how much easier it is to focus on taking care of the smaller details in life rather than to face the hard decisions about the bigger picture. Kudos to the screenwriters for that. Director Antoine Fuqua took us on a breathtaking journey into the heart of the violent world of his film's characters and kept me on the edge of my seat with the tension.

Without the scene where Willis converses with the priest and gives him a gun, the killing of the priest by the rebels is without emotional import. And the scene where the refugees are made to lighten their loads before setting out is remarkable. Similarly, the attempts by the older nurse to convince the younger nurse to stay, and her decision not to, is critical to an understanding of the perils of medical field work. I thought ALL the deleted scenes should have been in the movie. And at what expense? Eliminating a few minutes of back and forth gun shots? Which would have been a blessing to all but the die hard shoot 'em up crowd. Still, Bruce Willis puts in a fine brooding performance, though I wish I could have seen more of Tom Skerritt.

282,swatso,"Standard action fare, or a subtle political advocacy?",5,28 October 2005,"""Tears of the Sun"", is a lush, violent and eventually frenetic film by director Antoine Fuqua, set during a fictitious, and particularly bloody, Nigerian civil war. Using elements of the many real civil wars and coups d'état that have plagued Africa, the film develops from a plausible premise. Although it is an action movie overall, with all the blood and gunfire one would expect, ""Tears of the Sun"" does illustrate (graphically) the brutalities that are uncomfortable realities.After the democratically elected government of Nigeria is deposed by armed rebels, and the country descends into anarchy, an élite U.S. military unit is dispatched to evacuate four foreign nationals. With Lieutenant Waters (Bruce Willis) at their head, the unit departs for the mission with orders not to engage the militia unless fired upon. The supreme confidence of the men assures the viewer that success is ensured.Reaching the remote encampment, Waters and his men encounter a recalcitrant Dr. Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) who refuses to leave without 'her people'. Informed by his superiors that her patients could not be assisted, Waters instead deceives Dr. Kendricks, telling her that those who could walk could come. The three Catholic missionaries decline evacuation, even though certain death awaits them. And so, through the jungle they journey to safety with rebels in pursuit.The plot is quite simplistic, but also inconsistent and, often, annoying. Dr. Kendricks seemingly cannot comprehend that they are in the most immediate danger, consistently protesting that her people need to rest. Even after the group narrowly survives a rebel patrol she complains. Her belligerence is contrary to the overwhelming sense of urgent danger conveyed by the film. Presumably, it serves to generate a tension between her and Waters that ultimately leads nowhere, and certainly not to any romance.The first half of the film is set almost entirely in the depths of the jungle, as the group moves towards the Cameroon border. It is quite slow-moving and repetitive as the group advances and rests and then proceeds again. The jungle surrounds are lush, thick, wet and dark, and close-ups are prolific as Fuqua attempts to convey a sense of claustrophobia. However, little is done to endear the characters to the viewers. Willis as Waters speaks so scarcely and his portrayal so passive, that instead of appearing curiously enigmatic, he is distant and disinteresting. The neglect of character development during the early part of the film disconnects it somewhat from the latter half. The powerful and percussive African music largely fails to move the viewer, and potentially poignant scenes do not recognise their potential.The film takes a sudden turn when the group bear witness to an unfolding pogrom. The soldiers, having at this point already committed themselves to aiding Dr. Kendrick's patients, are moved to intervene. Here, ""Tears of the Sun"" rises above the prevailing mediocrity, if only because of the scenes' sheer grisliness. The audience is successfully shown what is euphemistically termed 'ethnic cleansing'. Fuqua does not shy away from depicting the senseless slaughter and sexual violence that has been inflicted upon innocent peoples. With this scene the soldiers emerge as 'heroes' not because they were obedient, but because they intervened to do the 'right thing'.The film, from this point, continues in violence and descends into an all-out action film. The ending is reasonably cathartic; the 'bad guys' are crushingly defeated in a display of pyrotechnics worthy of the ""Die Hard"" franchise, and Waters and the group make it to safety  although not without losses. Water's disobedience is vindicated, and the film alludes to its ultimate viewpoint  that American, and indeed international, intervention in crises is both desirable and 'right'. That the film begins with a title card of the oft-cited Edmund Burke quotation  ""the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing""  confirms the film's advocacy of this position. Incidentally, ""Tears of the Sun"" was released in the lead-up to the Invasion of Iraq. ""Tears of the Sun"" is a film best appreciated in retrospect.(S. R.

294,shaenna_bryce,I loved this movie. if you have a heart then it definitely works.,9,16 November 2006,"The movie 'Tears Of The Sun' was amazing. some people felt it was just another war movie but i believe it was different in the fact that it was not about Vietnam or ww2 or something we've seen a hundred times. it shows a lot of what really goes on daily and that we don't see. I cried a lot during this movie and once it was over i felt powerless and as though i wanted to make a difference and didn't know where to start. this movie helped change my way of thinking. The music throughout the movie creates tons of emotion with a mixed feelings ending. i did not think the movie had any boring or dull scenes at all. bottom line, the story line was good, not much of a twist but you can feel that the director is trying to get great emotions across. its not just another war movie about history. it is there to create a difference.",Tears of the Sun

Soldiers completed their mission thats it they couldn't save whole world and I bet such units like SEALs, 1st SFOD Delta knows that really well.. Some scenes are good like that one in village but again battle at end is such a cliché. TORS trying to be realistic war movie but plot line is just pure fantasy.. My rating is 2/10..

And a big napalm bombing to save the day. This is brilliantly stupid. The worst thing about it is that this movie desperately tries to be profound.

300,fredmalgud,"Bored me to ""Tears of the Sun."" Think Chuck Norris but worse.",3,10 March 2003,"This movie - while clearly well intentioned about conveying its message - is ultimately intolerable.  It represents almost no advancement in storytelling or in cinematic development and is painfully reminiscent of a Chuck Norris ""go into the jungle and save people"" movie from the 1980s... Except that this movie has a far less convincing plot and character development.The hackneyed cliches peppered throughout the movie (to use a cliche myself) evolve from being laughable to intolerable.  The saving grace of this film, if any, is some unique cinematography which, however, feels misplaced in the spectrum of the rest of the film.  Confused.  The primary entertainment value that can be derived from this movie, unfortunately, is spotting the continuity and factual errors.Blackhawk Down, to which this movie is compared in the trailer, would not have been the movie it was had so much painstaking attention not been paid to the essence of the film - military accuracy.  Bored me to ""Tears of the Sun"" is laughable in terms of factual representation... Neither the actors or the director seem to have paid any attention to the military advisor on the set - one scene that particularly emphasizes this point is that these Navy Seals are entirely exposed to an unseen enemy in the jungle, all standing in a line and firing as though they are fighting in the American Revolutionary war.  Clearly not a brilliant vision of modern warfare. Additionally, Bruce Willis' unit was inserted for a one day mission and miraculously they end up having ammunition for three days and numerous extensive skirmishes.  Military units are inserted with the tools they need for the job, not based on what action the script requires.  Additionally still, there is little development in what is really at heart in this picture - why this Navy Seals unit, highly disciplined and focused, so quickly decide to abandon their mission.  As inaccuracies and curiosities such as these pile up, the movie becomes less stimulating and more insipid, annoying.  Dull.This is one of those movies that feels like it was made with a television audience in mind - overwritten sentimentality, underwritten development and almost complete reliance that the audience would fill in both the pieces and the emotion necessary to appreciate the mess that is this picture.  This is a self-serving movie for both the director and actor.  No substance. Nothing redeeming or emboldening here.",Tears of the Sun

303,dragons_nightfighting,Tears of the Sun,10,22 July 2008,"I am a great fan of historical fiction. I think that stories can generate interest in historical events that otherwise may have gone without investigation. There are a couple of things to keep in mind while watching this movie in order to maintain an active connection with the mechanics of how it may be used to develop a factual sense of place in history.The story is clearly identified as a fiction set in a civil war in Nigeria. The last civil war in Nigeria ended in 1970, well before the events depicted in the movie. (The last civil war in Liberia, however, ran from 1999 to 2003. The country now has a female president, the first native Liberian elected to the presidency. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf graduated from Harvard with a Masters degree in Public Administration.) Nigeria is actually doing quite well economically. It is listed as one of the ""Next Eleven"" economies. Politically, however, it has been reported for human rights abuses.I thought that the movie displayed incredible artistry in its cinematography and revealed amazing nobility of character in the actors' portrayals.Sometimes the darker side of life 'happens' when we are busy making other plans. The soldiers, the people and the doctor in the story showed that they had ""miles and miles of heart"" in the face of life threatening events. I think that the movie was great in itself as a dramatic story, but it also provided an incentive to look into the recent history of Western Africa.SB Kidd",Tears of the Sun

It blew me away.The symbolism of knights, honor and chiverly. I found myself thinking of the Navy Seals in terms of the archetypes of King Arthur and the Round Table.At first it disturbed that the opposing force did not have a name or a three dimensional identity but at the same time I understand why for the point of view of this story..and with that understanding I could think  the opposing forces not as a enemy but a nemesis, an obstacle to overcome.Lena as well as many of the other females in this move, I saw, as Madonnas..a goddess type figure..not as the heroine or the love interest. The last scene where Lena pulls the hero to her and hugs him was powerful for me. It spoke to all aspects of my being.Many of the scenes you portrayed have been described to me or I have read them in a book. I remember when reading them how clinical and unemotional a storytelling tool, I was left feeling there was something more. And when listening to someone tell me about it to wanting to stay passive let them get it out...not to react badly to what ever happened.

305,AWINO,"Congratulation, Give credit where credit is due",9,26 June 2003,"It seems as though the majority of the viewer comments are negative towards this film and Bruce's acting. I've seen where people didn't like the battle scenes and don't understand the logic involved with Bruce's change of heart. This wasn't a love story surrounded by some battle scenes. I see where people are criticising how polite the SEALS were by using terms such as PLEASE, and MA'AM. That just goes to show you the true kind of respect that US military troops have for civilians. Obviously the DVD contains extra features and commentary which help explain the plot of this movie. In the extra feature part of the DVD, the writers of this movie explained why Bruce chose to turn the helicopter around and save the villagers. In the original version of this movie, there is a sequence where Bruce Willis and his SEAL team performed a similar rescue mission at some village in Bosnia. But Bruce's character chose to only save who he was ordered to save and leave the rest of the village behind. He later discovers that the villagers were executed. So, this time Bruce is presented with the same situation, only in Nigeria now. He decides to take action this time instead of letting the villagers behind to die. Obviously this whole scene never made it into the movie which we see, it was cut out and edited for time restraints. But this was originally part of the movie, and only those of us who have taken the time to view all the additional commentary to this movie realize and understand some of the logic. I think this was a fairly accurate account of what truely goes on in some parts of the world in regards to ethnic cleansing. I do agree with the whiny-ness of Dr. Kendricks though. She was an unappreciative, complaining, whining, b**ch. She should have been grateful that someone came to rescue her instead of allowing her head to be removed by a machete.",Tears of the Sun

And for me, it's one thing to read about it in my classes, and another to actually be able to visualize it.What ruined it for me was the non-stop boob shots of the doctor and horrible dialogue.  I couldn't take the characters seriously.  Plus, the movie was just way too long.I don't know.  This movie seemed to focus more on traditional Hollywood crap with the heroic soldier, the girl showing her tits, etc.  The story of the Nigerians themselves would have been enough if it had been focused on more and better documented (less superficially).

The good doctor has the requisite beauty, brains, and heaving bosom that all missionary doctors must have, and insists on behaving incredibly stupidly throughout the whole movie.

It was difficult to not laugh at the sight of about a thousand well-equipped troops homing in on Bruce's little group (I think about 5 of them were still alive at this point), only 20 feet or so separating them, and trying to believe that the 'good guys' still had a ghost of a chance.

I would think someone as big as bruce willis would look at this movie and laugh, he doesnt need the money, come on bruce pick a better script. It immediatly starts cliche with his crew having to go in an a mission and save this hot doctor.  Bruce is this tough lutenant, we think, atleast he looks the part, but we have no real investment in him or any of his crew as characters.  He could of been shot half way in to it and i wouldn;t of cared.  His lines were boring and unfelt, he just walked through the jungle doing his best clint eastwood squint.  The first interesting thing comes into the plot about half way through the movie when we find out that the last living member of the presidents family is in the group bruce and his boys are trying to get out.  So the movie starts awfull and gets better, unfortunately never better than bad.  It goes without saying that the hot doctor is bad too, i dont know her real name, although ive seen her in other flicks, most recently the matrix reloaded, but in this movie she sucks. Its not necesarily her acting, its more due to the writing of the movie that makes her character seem pathetic to me.  First of all she always has makeup on, and to draw just a smigeon of belief to this story she should get dirty and nappy with the rest of them.  She is too quik to mouth off to bruce and also too quik to warm up to him.

Once when returning to ""home"" in Ife got caught in a big crowd of people being harangued by a soldier, couldn't get away and at finish the soldier came down and asked what I was doing and insisted on coming to my house and luckily he didn't come inside, we had a Biafran cook boy. ( The Biafrans were very much the best educated in Nigeria, that being the first with missionaries.) We were also caught in a night armed curfew road block out of Ibadan and had to spend the night there with all the mozzies. Complained to the Brit High Comm and all he said was ""They have the gun and you have not"" - Hillare BellockSouthern Cameroon was great, did new road line and bridges from Victoria to Kumba, ground survey for aerial photos Mamfe to Bamenda, using Gerald Durell's former driver, very interesting ""small beef"" animals, and recount of trees felled (to widen road) between Mamfe and Ikom.

Southern Cameroon was formerly a German Colony, and they developed personal facilities in their colonies very much better than the Brits, but was given to UK as a WW 1 reparation.

A story about blinding hate from human beings towards other human beings. We stress about traffic jams and promotions or standing in line to long, while on the other side of the planet people try to believe in a better world, despite the killings, the insecurity, the hunger. And why does it happen? Because we let it happen. People lose their families and we will close our eyes. We heard enough about Africa. Other news makes the headlines.

This movie, however, is one of the many pieces of dog crap that Hollywood has served up in this genre.  There is nothing particularly wrong with the acting per se but the production, direction, and script are terrible.  The character's decisions are poorly justified and often out of character (come on!  a third world female missionary doctor is not going to be whiny and impractical).  The snippets of dialogue given to the supporting actors are so slim that they come across as contrived.It is apparent that whoever wrote this script wanted the movie to be about a soldier's conscience and his decision to act on that conscience rather than his duty to obey.  Unfortunately, the movie really doesn't explore this theme in any way and we just left with a serious of strange decisions from a supposedly experienced and hardened military man.  BTW Note to Hollywood: Bruce Willis is getting old to play a field combat Lt.Worst of all, the final action sequences are truly terrible.

However, I felt Dr. Lena's character and casting Monica Belluci were the two really bad parts of this movie. Although I have nothing against Monica Belluci's acting, it was disappointing to see a beautiful actress casted as Dr. Lena for 3 reasons: 1. Her attractiveness detracts from Bruce Willis' moral struggle over obeying orders, protecting his comrades, and saving innocent lives. Even though he claims that he's tired of standing by rather than doing what is right, there's still an underlying feeling that he just wants to impress the sexy doctor.2. It prevents her from contributing to the plot. Rather than being rough and diving into the action, she's seems to be an out of place princess that stands off to the side barking demands. Dr. Lena refuses to leave the refugees, but her purpose for being there isn't clear, especially since the seals already have a doctor. For most of the film, she ends up being the pretty doctor that stands in the back.3. She could be replaced by a gold nugget with a few changes to the story. ""Alright boys, go in, get the gold, bring it back to the chopper."" ""This nugget is huge! It'll never fit onto the chopper. We'll have to fly it out by jet, but that will mean we need to carry it 50 clicks to the nearest landing strip. Let's have these refugees help carry it!"" ""Your orders were to get the gold, not rescue a bunch of refugees."" ""Sir, we can't bring the gold back unless we bring the refugees to help carry it."" ""The American's have a huge nug of gold, let's chase them, kill them, and take it for ourselves."" ""Alright boys, do we cut our loses or do we home super rich?""",Tears of the Sun

I chose the movie impressed by the director's reputation and Willis' past record. However, I sensed a let down in the first five minutes of TOTS. Still I stoically plodded through the whole movie waiting for a surprise. It never came. Monica's character inspired disgust. She was forgivable only if you regarded her plain dumb.

It's a shame that not everyone knows what's going on in the world. For those people I would suggest reading news of other countries on the internet, because the news you see in your own country might not always tell you about the situation in other parts of the world. Off course some actionscenes are over the hill, but that's the only way Hollywood would spend money on / produce this movie. Look beyond that.About the movie: It's very moving and well put together.

I won't go into detail, but, for example, stopping to engage in a firefight to save a village full of unknown victims, putting his own mission at risk?!! We watched from beginning to end (I suppose that's a testimony to something; maybe our high tolerance for improbability) and kept marveling that the plot could be so wacky!

Part of it, is, I admit, a sense of frustration -- I see what's happening in Sudan and what happened in Rwanda and think why doesn't someone do something.Here is a movie about a small military group sent in to rescue a U.S. Citizen (naturalized) and the leader is moved to try to lead a small group of refugees to safety. Because of the numbers of refugees, they can't take the helicopter out -- so they go out on foot while being tracked by the rebel soldiers.See this after Hotel Rwanda and compare with Rules of Engagement (i.e. what's going to happen to the Lt. who ignored orders).",Tears of the Sun

Seriously, I could almost see the scenes in Black and White in my brain, just as if I had watched it on late night TV when I was a kid.It's like this, substitute Errol Flynn or some other dashing British actor for Willis, perhaps add a pinch of David Niven or a stalwart Sergeant-Major type (or both), change locale from civil war-torn Nigeria to Japanese occupied (or soon to be occupied) South East Asia (Burma, Indonesia, etc.). Change ""ethnic cleansing"" to ""Japanese atrocities"" and switch the Sadistic Nigerian rebel commander and rebel soldiers pursuing the refugees for a Sadistic Japanese Army colonel and his soldiers. The surviving son of the murdered President/Tribal leader becomes a surviving son of a murdered local king/chief. Instead of helicopters at the rendezvous, you have C-47 ""Dakotas""(as the British called them) landing in a field and circling over the burning mission. Instead of Colt Commando SMG, use British Sten guns. Add Hawker Hurricanes or Spitfires instead of F-18 Hornets coming to the rescue at the end and you have a typical Brit flick of the period.

Also from one Marine who is my camp counselor the way he described the jungle and how he had to cope with the death of his fellow marines this movie very accurately showed the hard times of soldiers and the problems faced. I think that this movie shows that not all war movies have to be non stop violence, blood, guts and gore to be a good war movie because this movie is not that, this movie yes has violence and brutality that all you blood crazy people love to see it also satisfies people who would normally like to watch a war movie but cannot stand the blood and guts that usually goes along with it.

The director didn't make the movie so some actors can carry rifles around and pretend to shoot people. BHD was based on a real-life account (Unlike Tears of the Sun, although it reflects the general state of affairs in some African countries). In fact, I consider it pretty much above Tears and slightly below Saving Private Ryan. SVP and BHD was also more militarily detailed (I'm from a military background).

Good story and good acting deliver a touching message regarding the cruelty of ethnic cleansing, and remind us that all too often force has to be met with force. One of the details that make this flick so different is the military aspect of it. Forget ""Navy SEALs"", Missing in Action"", ""U.S. SEALs"" and all those other special operation based movies. This film is as close as you will ever get to seeing a real SEAL team in action. You will get special warfare eye candy when the team does a stealthy assault on a village where some killing is underway. The way they move, how they attach suppressors without being told to, the tactics they use, the way they deploy to cover a large area with only eight men, the actual procedure of ""peeling off"" (retreating) later in the movie, and many other small details, are the closest I've ever seen that shows the general public what a deadly machine a real life SEAL team is.

354,z-43468,Tears of the Audience,6,16 January 2019,"Tears of the Audience
Tears of the Sun is a typical heroic action military film with a predictable main military styled theme, going against your orders and the mission because you feel it's not the right thing to do, and a lot of explosions and brutal war scenes. The script is pretty bland with a lot of unnecessary swearing and cheesy military tough guy lines, mostly monotonously spoken by the battle hardened navy SEAL vet Lt. Waters played by Bruce Willis. To be quite honest, I don't believe this movie gets anywhere near the recognition that it has gotten since it came out in 2003 if it's not starring the legendary action hero actor that Willis is.
The film takes place in a war torn Nigeria with the anti-Christian rebels going on a sort of cleansing tour of violence with the main goal of completely eradicating Christianity from the entire country. Lt. Waters and his team are sent into the thick of the jungle to rescue an American doctor named Lena Hendricks, played by the beautiful Monica Bellucci, before the ravenous rebels get to her and her injured and sick patients. The problem is that Dr. Hendricks won't leave without her patients. Reluctantly Lt. Waters agrees and takes the patients that can walk on their own with him and his team through the rebel infested jungle to the evac zone, but ultimately we learn that he tricked the doctor and her patients and only takes the doctor on the helicopter and leaves the helpless patients in the jungle to be found and slaughtered by the rebels. Because this entire sequence of events happens within the first 25 minutes of a two hour long movie, it's pretty obvious that the grizzled and immovable Waters was going to have a moment of weakness and turn back, and after a five minute over-dramatic scene of sad music and serval close up shots of that vintage Bruce Willis stone faced, hardened jawline, and squint eyed look that you see in all of his movies, that's exactly what happens. He decides to go back for the patients and fight his way to Cameroon through jungle and the hundreds of Nigerian rebels.
Director Antoine Fuqua couldn't replicate the attention and success that of arguably his best film Training Day, and I believe that has to do a lot with the plot and the main underlying themes in this film. It's difficult to do a Military action movie without having a lot of the same main ideas of, going against orders for the greater good, brotherhood of war, sacrifice, and dramatic bravery that are all scene in Tears of the Sun. A movie like Training Day can be unpredictable and exciting with several twists and you can have an unexpected ending. Most military movies that are not based on a true story can be very predictable. As soon as Waters turned that helicopter around to go back for the patients, it just seemed like the movie became a ticking time bomb for that explosion of the ""final battle"" that all military movies have where the main character (Bruce Willis) will get shot like 12 times and still be able to run around and carry his wounded men on his back while getting blown up by rockets and killing hundreds of enemy soldiers at the same time. Watching this movie, the audience knows that Waters and Dr. Hendricks are going to make it out alive, which is quite predictable, but at the same time it would be upsetting if he were to die at the end so it just seems like there was no chance of getting that stomach turning ending that everyone wants.
Nonetheless, besides the predictable plot and the unoriginal script, the action scenes were very enjoyable for someone, like myself, who likes watching battle scenes. Who doesn't like watching Bruce Willis running through the flaming jungle destroying everything in his path, looking invincible and getting shot more than anyone else in the whole movie combined, seeming to just be getting stronger and blooded as the battle goes on? No matter how predictable the film turned out to be, I will admit the action scenes were exciting and that fact is attributed to Bruce Willis and his unstoppable rampage through the jungle.
Overall this film won't be winning any awards, and I can't say that I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a ""good movie"". Although, if you're bored, and you want a cheesy, predictable, and very violent military action thriller that won't make you think too much, then you could try Tears of the Sun.",Tears of the Sun
