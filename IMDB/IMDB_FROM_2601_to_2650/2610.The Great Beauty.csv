0,SnoopyStyle,"old, tired, pretentious characters",6,1 January 2015,"Jep Gambardella once wrote an award winning novella. He is now an aged socialite writer. After his lavish 65th birthday party, he starts to reflect on his life and taking stock of his future. He meets various people in his life. He wonders if he should write another novel. A friend asks him to find a husband for his 40 year old stripper daughter Romona.This is no doubt that this is beautifully shot. The characters live in such a pretentious world that it comes off somewhat surreal. At some point, I rather not spend any more time with these people. These people are cold and eat at my nerves. There is one good laugh early on. That young girl who is forced to paint for her parents is the most compelling scene. It says so much that there are so few kids in the movie and she doesn't even want to be in their world. This is an old, tired and pretentious Rome. That may be the point but it's not fun to watch.",The Great Beauty
1,Hitchcoc,The Film Is Beautiful,9,2 September 2015,"This is one of the most visually remarkable films I've ever seen. It captures the spirit and beauty of Rome. The camera delves into corners and crevices of the night life and the daytime of this eternal city. This is the story of a man who has debauched his way through life. At sixty-five, he begins to wonder what happened. He is highly respected for his single book (he never wrote another) and has casual friends who are more users than true companions. He hearkens back to a relationship he had earlier, where a woman he could have had, instead ends up with a close friend, who, it turns out, never made her happy. The actions of the characters are vacuous and relatively feckless. He encounters artists who are mostly show and little substance. We see self-indulgent women wasting their lives. This is certainly more about the journey than the result. The people who are most solid in this man's life are the one's he takes for granted. Death seems to be around the corner and what do we do until that happens? Does it make any difference what we do? The beauty here is all around, but is wasted on most of these people.",The Great Beauty
2,boblipton,Written When I Was 66,10,17 December 2020,"Fifty years ago, Toni Servillo wrote a novel. It was praised, won an award, and he came to Rome and got caught up in the party set. He earns a living as an interviewer. Occasionally he is asked why he never wrote another novel, and he offers various, patently untrue reasons. Now his first love, whom he has not seen in more than forty years, has died. He turns thoughtful. He remains amused by the circus of the party set, but shreds their pretensions with a few well chosen words. He is obviously suffering a spiritual crisis, but when he tries to seek advice from a cardinal who is said to be next in line for the Papacy, the man walks away.The obvious movie to compare this to is Fellini's 8½, but I see its roots in Samuel Pepys' dictum that ""when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life."" Servillo is not tired of life, but he is tired of this life, and sees death coming for him. He is perfect in the role.Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino fills the screen with beautifully shot images: the overblown spectacle of the party set trying to amuse themselves, and the quiet beauty of the old Rome, its bridges, the shores, the Colisseum across the street from Servillo's apartment, the remembered image of his first love. It's a rich, beautiful, thoughtful, wistful movie.",The Great Beauty
3,claudio_carvalho,"The Deceptive, Pretentious, Pointless, Dull and Boring Movie That Seems That Never Ends",2,29 June 2014,"The 2014 Oscar winner in the category Best Foreign Language Film of the Year is a deceptive, pretentious, pointless, dull and boring movie that seems that never ends. The story is centered in an arrogant and futile Italian journalist that becomes famous with his only best-seller and then spends his life in the Roman high-society, going to parties and writing social columns. After his sixty-fifth birthday, he learns that his first sweet-heart died and she had loved him her entire life. This discovery apparently makes him bitter with his empty life and friends. The cinematography is top-notch and is the only thing that worths in this tedious movie that does not have continuity along the scenes. There are some bitter dialogs but the best part is indeed when the film ends after 142 minutes running time of boredom. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): ""A Grande Beleza"" (""The Great Beauty"")",The Great Beauty
4,kosmasp,Getting it,8,9 June 2014,"After all is said and done, what are we actually longing for? The movie will not give you an individual answer obviously, but it you might still be able to take something from this. Only if you are in the right frame of mind of course. Because this is not just about age, but life in general. And while it might not seem to actually trying to tell you something, it does.And that is the beauty of it. You also should consider that the nudity is not really there to agitate or arouse. The main character might be able to tell people some things that are too honest (and for that fact you'll either love him or hate him), but he's the one stirring things up. Be it on purpose or by just being himself. There comes a time when you might be past a few things ... that time came for our ""hero"" here ... a special kind of drama",The Great Beauty
5,gavin6942,Beautiful,6,14 July 2014,"Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo) has seduced his way through the lavish nightlife of Rome for decades, but after his 65th birthday and a shock from the past, Jep looks past the nightclubs and parties to find a timeless landscape of absurd, exquisite beauty.This film features exquisite cinematography (both the movement and the color). If you can say nothing nice about the acting, plot or anything else, this is a cinematography work of perfection.Robbie Collin likened it to Roberto Rossellini's ""Rome, Open City"" and Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" in its ambition to record a period of Roman history on film. ""Rossellini covered the Nazi occupation of 1944; Fellini the seductive, empty hedonism of the years that followed. Sorrentino's plan is to do the same for the Berlusconi era,"" he wrote. An interesting analysis, and a good way to help put it in the broader context of Italian film.",The Great Beauty
6,jboothmillard,The Great Beauty,7,21 July 2015,"This Italian film was one of the foreign language films I knew was getting a lot of attention during awards season, I knew it went on to win the big awards, and it was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was looking forward to it. Basically Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo) has spent decades charming and seducing his way through Rome and its lavish nightlife, he has has great success from his one and only famous novel that he wrote in his twenties, and has been a permanent fixture in the literary and social circles of the city, he is now retired and living a comfortable life writing cultural columns and throwing parties. Jep celebrates his 65th birthday, but this coincides with a shock from the past, he soon finds himself walking through the ruins and city streets and unexpectedly taking stock of his life. Jep spends his time after this encountering the various characters, reflecting on his life, his first love and find a sense of unfulfillment, he is able to truly see Rome for all its glory: a timeless landscape full of absurd and exquisite beauty. Also starring Carlo Verdone as Romano, Sabrina Ferilli as Ramona, Carlo Buccirosso as Lello Cava, Iaia Forte as Trumeau, Pamela Villoresi as Viola, Galatea Ranzi as Stefania, Franco Graziosi as Conte Colonna and Giorgio Pasotti as Stefano. From the title and the poster I saw for the film, I assumed this was going to be an artsy kind of film, I was partly right, there are certainly some interesting things to see, such as marble statues and paintings, and the many buildings along the way, the story of the old man searching for inspiration, haunted by his past and meeting the many dancers, painters and other characters on a journey is interesting enough, and there are amusing bits, but the visuals are probably the best thing this film can offer, a worthwhile comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!",The Great Beauty
7,Bunuel1976,"THE GREAT BEAUTY (Paolo Sorrentino, 2013) **1/2",5,8 March 2014,"I had been hearing about this movie ever since its Cannes Film Festival debut; the many accolades it has won in the interim culminated in last Sunday's Oscar win as Best Foreign Language Film. With respect to director Sorrentino and star Toni Servillo, I noticed a few titles I am vaguely aware of within their filmography – but, having been away from sampling Italian movie-making for some time, I have watched none of their previous efforts made in conjunction or separately. In his Oscar speech, Sorrentino mentioned his chief influences: Martin Scorsese's and the Talking Heads' were not really evident, controversial former Argentine soccer star Diego Armando Maradona's is showcased in a small but pointless vignette, while – for better or worse – Federico Fellini's is written all over the movie. In the end, I felt that a certain familiarity with both the locale (Rome) and the film-maker's previous work was required, in order for one to elicit the 'right' sort of reaction from it – and this alone, to my mind, attests to its essential failure! With this in mind, one wonders whether the restless style of editing – tracking shots repeatedly cut away abruptly, and key events also bafflingly occur off-screen – are typical of Sorrentino's work or not. Gauging from my average rating, then, I was ultimately not inducted among THE GREAT BEAUTY's legion of fans (it has just been released as part of ""The Criterion Collection"" for cryin' out loud!).Anyway, the movie has no plot to speak of – an ageing man is still riding the wave of his literary success some four decades earlier but has been unable to replicate it, or even feel the inclination tobut, of course, this has somehow changed by the time the end credits start rolling! – but it still is stretched to 142 minutes. In fact, the narrative is populated by trivial jet-set characters who, invariably jaded and self-deluding, pitifully cling to their youth and former glory by attending all the best parties! Furthermore, unreal situations abound: would Servillo as a 65 year-old with the face of a basset hound and a Leopold Stokowski hair-do truly be considered a ladies' man today?; Sabrina Ferrilli, a popular starlet on her homeground, is shown strutting her stuff as a stripper at 49 (I have to laugh when award-winning films highlight such dubious talents to international audiences when they had been around for so long and, living myself in close proximity to Italy, have already had my fill of them – the same goes for comedian/film director Carlo Verdone as Servillo's protégé!); the literary references constantly bandied about would have been acceptable in the beatnik/counterculture era, but impress nobody in our technological age.Again, religious caricature has been a constant in Italian movies (perhaps a natural extension of its people's psyche, considering they host the true ""City of God"" in their midst) ever since Fellini thrust ""La Dolce Vita"" onto the world: here, a 104 year-old living saint is venerated – and made to go up the Vatican steps on her knees which, under the circumstances, comes across as a Herculean featbut to what end?; similarly, I was reminded of movie critic David Thomson's put-down of Billy Wilder's redundant allusion to Gloria Swanson's child-like calligraphy in SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950), when a gourmet(!) Cardinal is repeatedly introduced as having been the greatest exorcist ever and, yet, nothing ever comes of it (the same applies to a magician's promise of making a giraffe vanish into thin air)! Besides, what is to be made of such celebrity cameos as French actress Fanny Ardant and Italian singer/songwriter Antonello Venditti appearing, for no very good reason, as themselves? Given the mentioned pious element, sacred music is intermittently present on the soundtrackno doubt to counter the rampant hedonism (for what it is worth, a considerable amount of gratuitous nudity is displayed throughout) otherwise represented by vapidly loud disco music.",The Great Beauty
8,writers_reign,Toni Rome,6,18 September 2013,"Whilst not quite so beguiled as the other viewers who have commented here I did find much to admire yet this admiration was tempered by the constant compulsion to relate The Grand Beauty to previous movies, principally those of Fellini - the several 'grotesques' in the cast; the aimlessness of the central character; the episodic rather than straight-ahead storyline - so that I was constantly saying to myself, where are we now, Amarcord?, La Dolce Vita? Toni Servillo's Rome is at once real and surreal and he wanders through it as if, at one moment he is not Jason himself but a minor Argomaut content to pursue a silver fleece, and at the next a watered-down Orpheus following Eurydice above, instead of below ground. Extremely lyrical in spots, extremely blah in spots. Sue me.",The Great Beauty
9,grantss,"Decent, but uneven, Italian drama",6,22 July 2015,"Decent, but uneven, Italian drama. A journalist/writer, Jep, turns 65 and starts to reminisce, plus ponder his life. What happens next is essentially several days in his life: his friends, interests and regrets.A movie which touches on many aspects of life: art, and how pretentious it can be, personal regret, friendship, finding meaning beauty in life. (The pretentiousness of art topic is examined with great hilarity in the scenes with the viaduct-head-butting performance artist - for me, the best passage of the movie. Quite ironic then that the movie also veers into pretentiousness from time to time).However, for all its good intentions and deeper meanings, the movie is quite uneven. There are scenes and moments of great profundity, emotion and/or humour, followed by scenes that add nothing and just seem to drag the story out. The movie is a roller-coaster ride of dullness and entertainment.Ultimately, quite watchable, with a good ending. It does require some perseverance though...Despite being far from perfect, The Great Beauty won Best Foreign Language Film at the 2014 Oscars. This despite the superb Danish film, Jagten/The Hunt, being nominated. The Hunt is a far better film. I guess the judges were sucked in by the Felliniesque style- over-substance and ode-to-Rome traits of The Great Beauty and felt obliged to give it the award. Would be sacrilegious to not give the award to a Fellini-like film...",The Great Beauty
10,oscaralbert,"What is ""THE GREAT BEAUTY""?",8,12 March 2014,"I don't think this is a question with the sort of ""spoiler alert"" answer you would expect to get if you asked, ""What is THE CRYING GAME?,"" or ""What is THE SIXTH SENSE?"" The short reply might be that THE GREAT BEAUTY is a contemporary version of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, on a much smaller scale. The checklist for Neo-Fellinism is covered here in full: references to Proust and Pirandello, full-frontal male and female nudity, blatant sacrilege, lots of random deaths, exotic animals such as a flock of white flamingos and a giraffe, startling juxtapositions of grandeur and grime, crazy stunts and parties, lots of substance abuse, subtle flashbacks, wild parties--even a dwarf is thrown in for good measure. The only other nominees for the 2013 Best Foreign Picture Oscar I've seen are THE HUNT (JAGTEN) and OMAR. For the first half hour of THE GREAT BEAUTY, I could not believe how it ""bested"" those two films, even though both of them were much smaller in scope (if not in content). After an hour, however, THE GREAT BEAUTY sort of blows the viewer away, and it's just getting started--with 81 minutes of astounding visuals and eclectic music to go. Who needs a traditional story line (such as in THE HUNT and OMAR), when you have such a salad of saints, sinners, rave music, and Latin chanting tossed together?",The Great Beauty
11,ferguson-6,The Good Life?,8,14 December 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is Italy's submission to the Academy for Best Foreign Film of 2013. If it wasn't such a beautiful film to watch, a fun game of spot the Italian director influence could be played. Director Paolo Sorrentino owes much to Fellini and La dolce vita, but this is more than a tribute. Sorrentino shows much style and insight, and his commitment to camera angles, movement, colors, textures and faces are quite something to behold.Toni Servillo plays Jep Gambardella, a man celebrating his 65th birthday by doing what he does most every night ... partying with his group of intellectual friends. Jep had a successful novel published in his 20's and has since worked sporadically as a journalist, but has never again focused on his writing. One can't help but notice the similarities to Marcello Mastroianni in La dolce vita, but Jep is jolted with news that sends him flashing back to his younger years and his one true love.Much of the story includes Roman decadence, and it can easily be viewed as the decline of Roman civilization both past and present. See, Jep's apartment overlooks the famous ruins of The Colosseum. Even moreso, we get a nice conflict between uppity society and the all too important modern and conceptual art crowd. Toss in a few pot shots at the Vatican and Sorrentino seems to be telling us that everyone takes themselves entirely too seriously ... even as we belittle and judge others. Whatever his true message, the sensory overload provided here could be a film class in camera style and is quite fun to watch.",The Great Beauty
12,christopher-underwood,I did enjoy watching this,7,19 September 2013,"I had some difficulty with this ambitious film seeming to document people and places on the outskirts of Rome, with clear references to Fellini. I was expecting a film of beauty, with images formed with style and imagination, but felt here the director was more interested in filling the frame with beautiful and not so beautiful things. As an observer, therefore and not as a creator. Still, we have what we have and I did enjoy watching this, despite the length. I liked many of the sequences, almost all of the dialogue but just wished I could have become a little more involved, either with the ramblings of the director's alter ego, played wonderfully by Toni Servillo, or in the various interactions of the lesser parties. Unfortunately, apart from the magnificent, Sabrina Firelli, who played the seeming wayward wife of a drug addled old pal of our narrator, there seemed nobody of depth, character or interest. Great soundtrack, although I could have done without most of the MTV styled dance music sequences, however significant they may have seemed to the director.",The Great Beauty
13,lasttimeisaw,A Giraffe in Rome,8,17 February 2014,"After his tepid foray into America (THIS MUST BE THE PLACE, 2011), Paolo Sorrentino returns to Rome, confects his latest film, LA GRANDE BELLEZZA, a rambling fresco about the menagerie of events around Jep Gambardella (Servillo), a one-time writer and a successful journalist. Jep is an urbane hipster habituates in nightlife, a spouseless socialite, both an adroit party thrower and avid participant, but what has changed since his 65-year-old birthday? He begins to meditate on the existential meaning of his life, through his eyes, we are invited to probe the unseen vista of the middle-class' decadence in the urban Roman society, it is a ritual, sentimental prose, plus an ode to the foregone glory.As a man with certain social status, Jep descends into nostalgic about the past, especially when he learns the death of his first lover, he recollects his memory of her, and meets a middle-aged stripper Ramona (Ferilli), who is an unwonted idealist with an enigmatic secret (not her intimacy with Botox obviously). They form a platonic relationship, romanticizes the ideal of love instead of making love. There are other facet of Jep's life which concerns his friends, his pygmy boss Dadina (Vignola), an affluent widow Viola (Villoresi) with her radical son Andrea (Marinelli), the condescending Stefania (Ranzi), the lascivious Lello Cava (Buccirosso) with his wife Trumeau (Forte) and Romano (Verdone), an ill-fated writer. They all have their episodic presence in Jep's life, their stories are more or less expanded but never elaborated. The portmanteau structure meanders over 2 hours, like a night cruise, sometimes we admire, sometimes we laugh, sometimes we indulge, not that the narrative matters, as if Sorrentino has a non-stop palliative generator to peddle viewers its pills to be enchanted with petrifying exquisiteness (from the body-swirling parties, then a giraffe disappears in a jiffy to the magical flamingos summoned by the wizened Saint), idiosyncratic modern art (Talia Concept, a kid's performance art and Ron Sweet's self-portrait exhibition, or maybe the Botox hospital, looks like a wacky play), and not to mention the groovy shindigs, all arrayed in painterly compositions, but Jep is not among all of this, he is an onlooker, a parvenu with patronizing stance to reflect the recognition we are hankering for, sophisticated, superior yet still hasn't found what he is looking for. Servillo (only 55 but always passes for older men) exemplifies the role without detectable effort, his creased physiognomy is telling enough to indicate what's in his vulpine mind. It is easy to find allusions to the vintage national auteurs like Fellini, Visconti with Sorrentino's darkly flamboyant touch, but the film seems to no more a panegyric to the ancient capital than a contemplative eulogy which fixates on the internal struggle of aging, not only our lives are ephemeral, so is the aggregate city itself, and this is what beckons the core of the Academy voters, I can safely put my ante on a BEST FOREIGN PICTURE win in the upcoming Oscar ceremony, a majestic 15-year comeback to the kudos after LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (1998, 8/10).",The Great Beauty
14,Hellmant,The best of 2013's Oscar nominees for 'Best Foreign Language Film'!,9,1 March 2014,"'THE GREAT BEAUTY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The best of 2013's Oscar nominees for 'Best Foreign Language Film' is this Italian comedy-drama flick about finding beauty in darkness. It was directed by Paolo Sorrentino and written by Sorrentino and Umberto Contarello. It stars Toni Servillo as a once great writer (having written a wildly successful book in his twenties) who now spends all his time partying and writing cultural columns. He begins to really rethink life after his 65th birthday. The film is set in Rome and has been compared to the works of Fellini and Rossellini. It's also been compared to the movies of Baz Luhrmann, which I highly agree with and is why I loved it!The story revolves around Jep Gambardella (Servillo), a socialite who just turned 65 (as the film opens) and is rich due to a popular book he wrote in his twenties. Since then he's done nothing but stay up late drinking (and partying), sleeping with various beautiful women and writing columns on culture. Now (after his birthday) Jep's starting to recollect on his past (especially after hearing about the death of someone who was very close to him); he roams the streets of Rome trying to take in all it's beauty (while also noticing all it's absurdities). He converses with friends and is constantly being shown questionable works of art by people who think they're artists (some are and some aren't, in the traditional sense at least). Jep also begins a non-sexual relationship with a woman named Ramona (Sabrina Ferilli).Like many of Luhrmann's films it's very quirky and ridiculously weird at times but it's also breathtakingly beautiful in other moments. 'MOULIN ROUGE' and 'STRICTLY BALLROOM' are two of my favorite movies and Luhrmann is one of my favorite directors. This isn't quite as good as his best work (the two I mentioned) but it's at least in the same league as his other films. Like those movies this continuously gets more gorgeous and emotional as it goes along and builds to a grand conclusion. I'm not as familiar with Fellini or Rossellini (who I know are considered to be great filmmakers), so I can't say how closely this cinematic tale resembles their art but it is a great film; disturbing and hard to watch at times but also very, very beautiful!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1t0-xhgYs",The Great Beauty
15,paul2001sw-1,Life as performance art,9,6 December 2015,"'La Grande Bellezza' is an extraordinary film. There are echoes of Michael Anontioni, Luis Bunel or even Peter Greenaway in it's styling; as well as a wonderfully shot paean to the beauty of Rome that somehow felt personal, at least to this sometime visitor of the Italian capital. An dilettante novelist and socialite playboy turns sixty-five, and continues living his life while looking back on the part that is over: in places the film feels like a stylised satire of the bourgeoisie, and the world of modern art. Yet in amongst these arid beginnings, it widens into a sympathetic portrait of a surprisingly subtle (but never unambiguously likable) man. The dialogue too, is funny and clever; and somehow although this should be exactly the sort of arty-pretentious movie that is too much for it's own good, it isn't. It was a left-field choice for an Oscar nomination; but a wholly deserved one.",The Great Beauty
16,MOscarbradley,A Masterpiece.,10,14 September 2013,"Italian cinema is, at last, on a roll again. Perhaps not in the same way as when Rossellini, Visconti, Fellini and De Sica were batting masterpiece after masterpiece into the arena but maybe more prodigiously than at any time since the young Olmi and young Bertolucci were setting the screen alight. In recent years we have had Michelangelo Frammartino's ""Le Quattro Volte"", Gianni De Gregorio's sublimely gentle comedies ""Mid-August Lunch"" and ""The Salt of Life"" and, perhaps best of all, the films of Paolo Sorrentino whose ""The Consequences of Love"", ""The Family Friend"" and ""Il Divo"" were highly original and sufficiently off-the-wall to invite comparisons with Fellini. His one venture into English-language cinema, ""This Must be the Place"", met with a largely hostile reception from critics who accused him of being self-indulgent but I found the film to be gorgeous and quirky and just what I would have expected from so idiosyncratic a talent. And now we have ""The Great Beauty"", a return to Italy and a return to, what his critics might see as, earlier form.This film, too, has been compared to Fellini which is entirely appropriate as this is a ""La Dolce Vita"" for the 21st century. You can even imagine the film's central character, Jeb, as Marcello, older if hardly wiser and for Sorrentino nothing much has changed. But if this is Sorrentino in Fellini mode it's just as close to the beauty and spectacle of ""Amarcord"" or, more appropriately, ""Juliet of the Spirits"". Once again the lead is taken by Toni Servillo, who was Sorrentino's Andreotti in ""Il Divo"" and once again he confirms his position as one of the cinema's finest actors, heading a truly superb ensemble cast. As in ""La Dolce Vita"" there is no real 'story' but rather a series of episodes in the life of Jeb in the days following his 65th birthday, (his birthday party is the first of the film's many great sequences). If there is a theme it's Jeb's increasing disillusionment with the lifestyle he has associated himself with over the years, a lifestyle he is very reluctant to give up, no matter how pragmatically he views it. He is a man who has had many women but no real relationship to speak of, (the early love of his life married someone else). He meets the daughter of an old friend, a 42 year old stripper with a drug habit, and they strike up a relationship of sorts though when they go to bed together he is happy when they don't have sex. He gets sustenance from his friends although he can be cutting and abrasive in their presence. It seems as it is they, and not money or power, which keeps him going.This is a magnificent movie, the kind of film that you know is being composed, frame by gorgeous frame, by a master film-maker. It is a breathtaking melange of sound and images, of great performances and superlative dialogue that draws you in and holds you from its first shot to its last. Some directors open their films with great tracking shots but Sorrentino saves his to the end, up, over and under the bridges of the Tiber as the final credits roll. Don't leave the cinema to the very last second.",The Great Beauty
17,dromasca,beautiful but ...,7,26 February 2014,"A few days from now 'La Grande Belleza' will probably get the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language picture so it's probably a daring act on my part to share the opinion that this film is over-rated and that it's not - in my humble opinion - the best film of Paolo Sorrentino. I actually like a lot the work of the Italian director, but I liked more the sharp critic of the Italian political system in the biographical Il Divo and especially the very original approach to the Holocaust in 'This Must Be the Place' - one of the best and unusual films in the Holocaust genre.There is certainly a lot of charm and visual beauty in this 'Great Beauty'. If this was a documentary I could have enjoyed the views of Rome and the film is a declaration of love for the Eternal City, a poem dedicated to it's magnetism and power to corrupt. If it was a study of characters I would have first admired the aristocratic spleen of the principal hero in the story, as well as the collection of characters from the debauched and corrupt, and yet so fascinating high society and artistic media the characters come from. The film however also tries to draw a moral about the ephemeral nature of life and love, and about the vanity of beauty and emptiness of the extreme sensations - and this moral core is too thin for the fabulous wrapping it is enveloped in.Of course, one can admire the exquisite cinematography and splendid performance by Tony Servillo, the preferred lead actor of Sorrentino. Just by seeing him here, in a film and a role so different from the one in Il Divo one can appreciate what a great actor he is and how he identifies with the character and melds in each role he undertakes. The disappointment is however with the director approach. Sorrentino used us that each new film is different than the previous one - strong and original, unexpected in vision and inventive in means. In La Grande Belleza he seems to have decided to quote Fellini - does Fellini need to be quoted, and did he really need to quote him? I love Fellini but I know that he died a while ago and I did not go to see a film of Fellini, but a film by Sorrentino, hence my disappointment.",The Great Beauty
18,gbill-74877,Not enough depth,4,6 April 2021,"I just could not connect with this one, and found the main character pretentious and somewhat repelling. He's older and ostensibly looking at life with greater perspective, but I didn't get a lot of wisdom or introspection in his cynical musings. If anything, it feels like a vanity project to the male ego, complete with gratuitous nudity and mean-spirited scenes like the one in which he calmly dissects a woman's life at a social gathering. It's a treat to see beautiful images from Rome, but even here, there is an air of manufactured artificiality about it.

20,851222,Great movie,10,4 May 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""La grande bellezza"" (2013) is without a doubt the best movie Paolo Sorrentino has made yet. Not only this is his best film to date, this is a one great movie on every account. I was captivated by it from the first frame, which opens on a pretty long party sequence till the very last frame. Yet, this movie isn't for everyone. Those who like clear and plot based movie might find this gem to difficult and even boring. Nevertheless, this is one of the very best Italian movies i have ever seen. Every scene in this movie is done very skilfully and it's just interesting to watch and to listen to characters, especially to our hero Jep Gambardella (superbly played by Toni Servillo), a ""party lion"", who at 65 starts to have some thought about life and starts to find and see beauty in everything, even the most bizarre things. Overall, ""La grande bellezza"" (or ""The Great Beauty"") was a huge surprise to me. Saw it first time just now, i would like to recommend this near masterpiece to everyone who liked great movie simply about life - it's not about plot, it's about moments here and now, the people, culture, even nightlife of some Bohemia of Rome.

Like a man's in search of a great beauty at the age of dusk.An 2014 Oscar submission from Italy and nominated for short list as well. Will this justify to be nominated? Well, I think yes. Some of the scenes are not quite relevant to the story, just like dragging in from out of the topic. At a time it was artistic and eye catching. Throughout, the music is what well backed the irrelevant material story. Especially the opening and funeral ones were incredible.Many scenes had not explained its purpose. Sometime you make scratch your head about not getting the meaning. One of those was the conference of world spiritual leaders takes place. Exactly, it is not about what it's trying to tell us, but the capacity for understanding on stuffs will be tested. This movie can't be enjoyed by everyone, but certain people will find hidden gem and messages or an art form of it in its depth.I earlier mentioned it is a irrelevant story, it might be a little harsh to say that because protagonist in the movie itself confused about his remaining life. So he begins to see in people his life reflection and sometime he won't understand others character behaviour. On many occasions he asks them about it, but the answers won't convince him till he himself witness the truth. We had seen in other movies where the protagonist goes to India for self discovery, and that is what here this man does in own city.",The Great Beauty
22,Thanos_Alfie,A beautiful movie...,8,20 April 2020,"""The Great Beauty"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a man trying to figure out which is the next step in his life after his 65th birthday. He starts thinking about his life and the choices he made questioning himself about many of them and considering the alternative options he had. He is also thinking how his life would be if he made a different choice or choices.I have to admit that before watching this movie I was not sure of what to expect from it or even what I was about to watch. ""The Great Beauty"" is a simply amazing movie and it is a beautiful combination of drama, beautiful music and photography. The true meaning of this movie you will find it out after watching it and start thinking about it. You will soon understand that you are not thinking about the movie itself but for your choices and you life in general. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is a life lesson for everyone and it will change your life.",The Great Beauty
23,Red-125,A minority opinion,6,2 March 2014,"The Italian movie La grande bellezza was shown in the US with the title, The Great Beauty (2013). It was written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino.The film stars Toni Servillo as Jep Gambardella, an aging author and (apparently) sometime journalist. Jep wrote one extraordinary book in his youth, and he has been coasting along on that achievement ever since. He appears to have an endless supply of money. He's invited everywhere, goes everywhere, and knows everyone. Naturally, by now, he's bored with all this. (He doesn't change, but he's bored.)So, in an effort to find meaning in life, he prowls his old haunts, and encounters (and re- encounters) unusual people--an aging stripper, a magician, a cardinal obsessed with food.And that, pretty much, is all there is. This movie just won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. That means that it will play in theaters for a while longer. If you're going to see it, see it on the large screen. Rome looks beautiful, and some of that beauty will be lost on DVD. I wouldn't have given this film an Oscar. However, if there were an Oscar category for most photographically beautiful city, Rome would win.",The Great Beauty

It's about the lives of the wealthy privileged, who doesn't really work, who think socialite life is the best occupation of the world: in spite of their art shows, beautiful mansions, vacations, wardrobes, they are mindless, soulless, heartless to just achieve desire for money and sex ! Those people verify my belief that the upper you are, the less you got values ! Maybe the sets are beautiful because Italy is an old country with a famous heritage but 140 minutes among those ghouls are just excruciating for me, even with Sabrina, playing a meaningless stripper at 51 years old !

The first time is the first cry from a new born baby's lips and the last is the death rattle. Everything between is untruth to a greater or lesser extent."" Many Hindu and Buddhist teachings also refer to the world as being Maya or illusion. According to French writer Louis-Ferdinand Celine, ""Our journey is entirely imaginary. That is its strength. It's a novel, just a fictitious narrative."" In Paolo Sorrentino's stunning The Great Beauty, novelist Jep Ganbardella (Toni Servillo), unable to write another book since his successful first novel, The Human Apparatus, agrees, saying ""After all... it's just a trick. Yes, it's just a trick."" To discover that, however, he has to move past ""the chitter-chatter and the noise, silence and sentiment, emotion and fear, the haggard, inconstant flashes of beauty, and then the wretched squalor and miserable humanity, all buried under the cover of the embarrassment of being in the world."" Winner of the Golden Globe award for Best Foreign Film and Italy's entry for the 2014 Oscars in the same category, The Great Beauty is a character study of the decadent elites of modern Rome and by extension, contemporary society, yet it also moves beyond that to examine eternal themes of death, love, beauty, and the complexity of life and art.The film begins on a jarring and surreal note and continues in an episodic Fellini-like vein throughout its two and one-half hour runtime - the sweet life revisited. After snapping a picture of the skyline with its beautiful domes and bell towers, a Japanese tourist visiting Janiculum Hill suddenly collapses and dies. We are suddenly shifted to a raucous 65th birthday party for Gambardella on a terrace opposite the Roman Colosseum where seemingly all the socialites, would-be artists, and pseudo-elites have gathered, perhaps the one-percenters of Roman society. One almost expects to see an ""Occupy Via Veneto"" demonstration in the streets below.As Jep moves in and out and around the Roman high life, Sorrentino's acerbic put-downs and satire of the rich and famous travel with him. Now a journalist for a Vanity-Fair style culture magazine, he watches a performance artist run headlong into a brick wall, sustaining a deep cut on her head, then later interviews her, doggedly asking her to explain what she meant by ""feeling vibrations."" He waits his turn for a plastic surgeon at a Botox injection session, takes in a performance of a man throwing knives at a frightened-looking woman, observes a live giraffe at a historic site in rehearsal for a magic show, looks at a photographer's self-portraits that span his entire lifetime, and sees a 12-year-old girl heaving different colored cans of paint at a wall canvas while crying and screaming.Through all the partying, the hedonism, and the ersatz art shows, there exists a stream of discernible emptiness that runs not only through his own life, but through the lives of those he surrounds himself with. After calling out a woman's pretensions, he softens the blow by telling her, ""We're all on the brink of despair. All we can do is look each other in the face, keep each other company, joke a little. Don't you agree?"" His relationship with Ramona (Sabrina Ferilli), the daughter of his good friend, the struggling playwright Romano (Carlo Verdone), however, brings a new focus to his life but it is short-lived.It is only when he hears of the death of Eliza, a girl he loved as a teenager, that he receives a wake-up call. Reliving his missed opportunity in flashbacks, he learns through her diary that she loved him all along and begins to reexamine the direction of his life. After a less than enlightening meeting with an aging cardinal (Roberto Herlitzka) who wants to talk only about his favorite recipes, he throws a dinner party for a 104-year-old woman rumored to be destined for sainthood who has spent her life working with the poor in Africa and who subsists on 40 grams of plant roots. Seeing life in all of its simplicity and wonder, she movingly points him in the direction of the authentic ""great beauty"" that he seeks.Servillo is magnificent as the blocked writer seeking renewal and his presence makes every scene come alive with spontaneity. Adding to this is the gorgeous soundtrack featuring The Beatitudes of Martynov, choral works by David Lang, John Taverner, and Arvo Part, and the contemporary Yolanda Be Cool's We No Speak Americano. Though The Great Beauty is not a film about Rome per se, the cinematography of Luca Bigazza memorably captures the striking sights and sounds of The Eternal City, the ancient monuments juxtaposed with the modern buildings. Literally bursting with the pulse of flawed humanity, The Great Beauty is a feast for the eyes, the ears, and the soul.",The Great Beauty
26,l_rawjalaurence,Modern update of Fellini,8,20 October 2013,"THE GREAT BEAUTY focuses on the life of an aging writer Jap Gambardella (Toni Servillo) who discovers that most of his life has been meaningless, despite his popularity and reputation. Basically a series of disconnected episodes, Paolo Sorrentino's film portrays a Rome that is simultaneously highly desirable yet simultaneously destructive. The photography is breathtaking; the camera focuses on the extraordinarily bright light at various times of the day, and how that light suffuses the characters' lives with apparent joie de vivre. The only snag is that the characters have nothing really in their lives, other than the endless round of parties, balls and socializing. The film takes some satirical pot-shots at organized institutions (such as the Catholic Church), which are likewise shot through with superficiality, despite their pretensions to piety. Jap only discovers what he might consider the 'meaning' of life right at the end of the film, but he can never grasp it. Servillo's performance in the central role is a curiously flat one: facially speaking he bears a strong resemblance to David Niven, and it's clear that he is trying to play the same kind of role as an urban socialite (remember BONJOUR TRISTESSE, for example). However Servillo lacks Niven's facial and emotional depth. Perhaps this is deliberate; by evoking memories of Niven, and showing how Servillo cannot emulate the older actor, Sorrentino underlines the superficiality of his central character's life. THE GREAT BEAUTY lulls viewers into a sense of false security with its visual beauties; we have to keep vigilant in order to understand the points Sorrentino is making.",The Great Beauty

28,Turfseer,"Multiple welcome interpretations for Sorrentino's plush, Fellini-like feast",9,24 March 2014,"'The Great Beauty' is the story of Jep Gambardella (Toni Servilo), an aging journalist from Rome who begins a course of self-reflection on the occasion of his 65th birthday. In his younger days, Jep was determined to become the #1 bon vivant amongst the Roman nouveau riche—and succeeded! He published one novel and like many one hit wonders, rested on his laurels and rode into middle age on the coattails of that one success. Jep sustained himself by writing occasional magazine articles with the support of his acerbic magazine editor, Dadina, a dwarf who appears to be instrumental in keeping him afloat, despite his self-doubts.Jep faces a crisis when the husband of a woman who he briefly dated when he was 20, reports that his wife has suddenly died. This is 'The Great Beauty' of the film's title—we see her in a series of flashbacks as Jep muses on the woman 'who got away'. But 'The Great Beauty' has a double meaning—it stands for the collective soul of Rome itself—with its attendant characters, who run the gamut from the profane to the magisterial. Director Paolo Sorrentino takes us on Jep's vibrant, episodic journey, as he interacts with characters from both his past and present.A good part of 'Beauty' is taking in the decadence—fortunately good-natured Jep is the hero here, parrying all the negative talk with the quick wit he's accumulated over the years. Some of the 'lost ones' include a pretentious performance artist who offends Jep by smashing her head into a wall and calling it art and a fellow journalist who he takes apart after she brags about her fame due to the publication of 11 novels by a low rent Marxist press. And Jep wants more from a woman who wants to show him nude photos of herself on her computer since as he says, at his age, he ""wants more.""Jep is thrown for a loop when the 40 year old stripper daughter of a bar owner he hasn't seen for 30 years, dies of AIDS, after they strike up a friendship. While Jep advises not to cry at a funeral because it might upset the family, he does the opposite at the funeral of the disturbed son of a female friend. And when his best friend, Ramono, decides to throw in the towel, give up his playwriting career and return to his hometown, he continues to soldier on, despite his isolation.It's really not clear what turns Jep around from his cynicism to embracing life in all its beauty (which includes despair)—I believe it's his accumulated experiences that causes him to start looking at life as a glass half full, rather than half empty. Beyond the positive, is the sense of awe—perhaps Jep experiences this when he meets the man who's taken a photograph of himself, every day of his life.Religion comes into play at film's end, when the nun is seen taking an injection to cure her of sweaty hands (she needs dry hands to meet the Mother Theresa clone, 'The Saint'). Jep obviously is put off by all the discount Botox doctor's 'takers' including the status seeking nun. Later, the ex-Exorcist Cardinal hardly impresses as a man of faith, with his obsession with culinary delights (as opposed to devotion to spiritual matters). But 'The Saint' appears to be the real deal, as Jep is shocked to find her sleeping on his floor in his apartment. Her devotion to the poor, her sense of sacrifice, proves there's a good side to the church, despite all the failures.Ultimately, it's Jep himself, who represents all that's good about Rome—the man who isn't afraid to look deep into his soul, plume the depths of despair and emerge triumphant. Jep's journey ends where it begins—to a moment in his youth, in all its naivety and simplicity. 'The Great Beauty' sometimes goes on for too long (not sure if I liked all the long-winded party scenes) but nonetheless, 'The Great Beauty' requires obligatory repeat viewings as there is so much food for thought in this most thoughtful, Fellini-like feast.",The Great Beauty
29,meeza,Not that great of a beauty!,7,20 March 2015,"Sorry, but I did not find great beauty in the Oscar-winning Foreign Language Italian flick ""The Great Beauty"". Call me not cultured enough, but I did not find enough intriguing qualities in this movie to hail at as a deserving Oscar-winning foreign language movie; but what do I know, as long as I inject great beauty in my corny movie puns, that is all I need. Anyways, Writer-Director Paolo Sorrentino's movie stars Toni Servillo as Jep Gambardella, a 65-year-old Italian socialite who wrote a classic Italian novel decades ago but never wrote another book again. Gambardella preferred to gamble his lifestyle instead in the world of lavish parties, beautiful women, and daring adventures. Let's just say that Gambardella is no geriatric Cinderella. This premise of him living the aforementioned lifestyle instead of focusing on his writing artistry is beated on by a dead horse so much by Sorrentino, that it made me transcend to a great boredom mode. Now, I must say that the film's cinematography is tops. it is a love letter to Rome. But that is all I really found beauty in ""The Great Beauty:, but what a beauty it was.

30,estebangonzalez10,Not a fan of surrealism,5,22 February 2014,"""I was destined for sensibility. I was destined to become a writer. I was destined to become Jep Gambardella.""It seems director Paolo Sorrentino has become destined to evoke Fellini's work in La Dolce Vita with his skillful direction in La Grande Bellezza, and for many critics it's become one of the best films of the year. Unfortunately this film didn't work for me considering I'm not a huge fan of surrealism nor style over substance. Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful and ambitious film that captures the artistic spirit of Rome with poetic imagery through musical set pieces. The film gives its audience a series of sensations and feelings, but it didn't feel cohesive for me. I found The Great Beauty overlong and dull. Despite engaging me with its visuals during the opening party sequence, eventually the movie wore down on me. There are some touches of comedy here and there as we follow the main protagonist's quest to finding the beauty and meaning of life. Despite the gorgeous set pieces and poetic symbolisms thrown all over the place, the journey wasn't worth taking for me considering I had a hard time relating to the main character. I know I may lose a lot of friends for not liking this film, but just as the pretentious and snobbish artists that hung around with Jep, I felt the film was exactly that: pretentious and snobbish. I didn't find any substance to the film other than the gorgeous style so I am sorry but I can't lie, this film didn't work for me.The film opens with a few Asian tourists visiting Rome and admiring its beauty and all of a sudden one of them dies. The film then jumps right away to a party where we are introduced to a successful journalist named Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo, Il Divo and Gomorrah) who is celebrating his 65th birthday. He considers himself a sensitive man and that is what allowed him to perceive the world differently from the rest and inspire him to become a writer. He has become a legend in Rome for writing a very popular and Award winning novel several decades ago, but since then he hasn't written any more novels and dedicates himself almost exclusively to the night life of Rome. However his life takes an unexpected turn when he receives some terrible news from the past: the first woman he actually loved passed away. All of a sudden Jep begins questioning his life and decides to search for the true beauty after realizing the emptiness behind all the extravagant parties he's thrown.I guess I'm not a reliable source when it comes to these sort of surrealist films considering I'm not a fan of the genre. I won't deny this was gorgeously directed and that the set pieces were marvelous, but I really found it to have little substance. It was self indulgent and blah blah with very little actually going on. I didn't find the film to be philosophical either, the final revelation near the end is something we've heard very often so sticking with this man's journey didn't have any reward for me personally. The film does succeed however in showing the excesses and portraying wasted talents thanks to hedonistic lifestyles.

33,jadepietro,This Beauty is Only Skin Deep,8,1 March 2014,"This film is recommended.The Great Beauty is a gorgeous film to watch. With Rome as the backdrop, how could it not be? The story is pure Fellini. It's La Dolce Vita with a mix of 8 1/2, two films that seem to be the direct inspirations for this modern day tale of hedonism and lost dreams.Toni Servillo plays Jeb Gambardella, a one-time novelist who learned to rest upon his laurels. Choosing the easy path, Jeb became a gossip columnist and full-time party-goer in Italy's elite circle, enjoying the good life and squandering his talents. As Jeb turns 65, the gentleman ponders his unfulfilled life, reflecting on its highs and lows, the roads he never took and the love he surely lost. Jeb's memories collide with his fantasies. He aimlessly walks the streets of Rome and his thoughts begin to meander, just as the film often does. Corrupted by Rome's high life, he would rather observe than participate in the simple joys of life.The Great Beauty is skillfully directed by Paolo Sorrentino, who also co-authored the screenplay with Umberto Contarello. The film debates the image of beauty and its elusive dreams. But just as it is in life, nothing is perfect and The Great Beauty carries its own imperfections along with it. The director shows a wonderful visual flair (along with his cinematographer, Luca Bigazzi), but the film overindulges and overstates the obvious. Too often, the film wallows in its own pretentiousness as it takes direct aim at easy targets like the Catholic Church and the rich and the famous. Some judicious editing could made the film less derivative as Sorrentino examines all aspects of Rome's culture. The film is high on celebrating its mood and ambiance: a nightly excursion to an art museum and its cultural treasure trove, a detour to an Italian strip club and its gyrating showgirls, a saintly meeting with religious leaders seeking absolution, one too many Conga lines of inebriated party guests. (We don't actually meet Jeb until about 15 minutes into the film.)Still, The Great Beauty has so many memorable images to admire, from the surreal (flamingos gathered on a stone balcony, a ceiling of water, a giraffe standing tall amid the ruins) to the grotesque (ladies with trough-ladened make-up, elderly women in plain dress contrasted by fashionistas dressed to the nines, stern nuns in black habits looking austerely into the camera). The music score by Lele Marchetti is lovely and blends magnificently with the grandeur of the ancient and modern Italian cityscapes. Servillo is very well cast as the unhappy writer. The actor brings to his role a charm and elegance, making his egotistic character more involving than on the written page.Technically masterful but emotionally inert, The Great Beauty has scenes of greatness and beauty, and the film is fascinating and well worth seeing for its epic sweep. But it's all exterior posing. Frankly, the film's beauty, though stunning, is not very deep.

34,EdgarST,La grande bellezza,10,2 May 2014,"«La grande bellezza» is a catalogue of ideas, keys and open secrets for all ages, although I am almost sure that being coetaneous to the leading character Jep Gambardella, is some sort of privilege that allow us to enjoy this motion picture more. I have talked about it with a 27-year old good friend and scriptwriting colleague. We share the same opinion, that it is a beautiful, wise and distending work; as writers, we agree that it is rich, varied, complex and simultaneously transparent. Nevertheless I must add that for me, a man who is as old as Jep, the film turned into an illuminating, multifaceted experience, that told me many thing about the geographical determinism that many persons reject, it spoke to me about Roma-the city and Roma-the empire, and it told me many things about myself. I know that people from a given place bring their laughter, stride and shadow along, and they also bring the story of their city: as I saw the scene in which Stefano, the holder of keys, opens the doors of halls and rooms filled with beauty, history and art, not only did I think of Federico Fellini's «Roma», but of Roman persons I have known, and I thought all at once, ""They all bring this cultural load behind their backs, maybe unknowingly"" Maybe that is why the simple assertion made by the old nun known as a Saint, has other resonance: ""Roots are important"", says she, referring to the roots she eats, but also to roots that define us. The film opens with a noisy and frivolous Roma, that evokes (also in other scenes) «La dolce vita», also by Fellini. But this apparently perpetual party becomes no longer a common place, but rather a distinctive feature without which I, we cannot imagine Roma. The idea of Roma-the empire has also had a strange fascination on me. Of the little that I have learnt in History courses, I hardly remember a cultural and geographical domain that had a bigger impact on me that the Roman empire. Not even the present-day American version of an empire, which I do not perceive in books but in direct, can strike me, with its daily boasting that our lives hang from their atomic fits of dominance. Roma-the empire strikes me as something great, cruel, impressive, wise, mad and vulgar too, in its beauty and exuberance. Finally I truly believe that, for a good part of my life, I was blatantly mundane as Jep Gambardella defines himself (in an extraordinary performance by Toni Servillo), as Jep is described on screen, and as we imagine how he should had been in his younger years, climbing and descending peaks of concupiscence, militancy, apprenticeship and pain. Each character –the moving stripper Ramona, the unloved playwright Romano, the dogmatic Stefania, the ideal boss and dwarf Dadina- is a friend or someone we met on the road of life, each is one of our facets, an option yet to discover or dig deeply. In their script, Paolo Sorrentino (at 43) and Umberto Contarello (at 55) reproduce that sudden awareness of everything around us that comes to many with old age, that feeling of futility as we face past actions, that foolish and impertinent judgment we make of the meaning of life, as we see us in old age and find every action without any projective dimension, as something flat and despicable. Jep and his friends may also think of frustration, but it is a frustration determined by the dichotomy ""winners versus losers"", according to a system of values invented by a moronic TV host. Or hostess. I think that the greatest value of «La grande bellezza» is that it triggers (in the enlightened young or in the alert old) a flow of thoughts, sensations and emotions about this early 21st century, in which we are arguing if it is an aftermath or a prologue We live it and sense that we are contributing to (or alienating from) the evolution to another order of things, at least minimally fairer than previous. Maybe this film can be used (if it were necessary to do so) to let us all know that our passage through the biosphere is not futile, even if we find no sense to it. Maybe this is ""la grande bellezza"", the real great beauty of life, and not the chimera that Jep Gambardella is after, to find inspiration and tell the world the story of ""the king of the mundane"".",The Great Beauty
35,Sergeant_Tibbs,Strips the pretence from modern art and knocks it off its pedestal. A compelling examination of the relationship between society and art.,8,16 November 2013,"It's been 20 years since the film world lost Federico Fellini and his passing has caused a great dent in Italian film world. I can hardly think of a notable film since, besides the overpraised and mediocre Life Is Beautiful. Granted, I'm certain I'm not giving Italian cinema enough credit and there will be gems in there but Paolo Sorrentino's The Great Beauty still feels very distinctly like a response to those 20 Fellini-less years in both a tribute and an update to La Dolce Vita. It's about the relationship between life and culture, most specifically society and art. While still being heavily integrated into its subculture, it strips off the pretence off modern art and knocks it off its pedestal. The film examines the human condition and identifies what everyone has in common - love, nostalgia, death and the fact that all our lives are in tatters but that's normal and wonderful.While sometimes the art it presents is mocked and deconstructed, the irony is that sometimes the performance art it shows is incredibly profound. It's a fascinating film in this regard that leaves interpretation and emotional impact to the viewer rather than shoving anything down anyone's throats. While it is deep and reflective, it has a beating sensual heart to it. However, beyond its study its narrative is quite messy. There's not much in the case of plot and it jumps around far too much, sometimes staying in extravagant party scenes Baz Luhrmann would kill for, but that's fine, it's not what it's trying to do. What really supports its themes is the Scorsese-esque cinematography. There's an almost angelic and surreal quality to its smooth camera-work constantly gliding over every frame. The Great Beauty is a film to treasure, thought-provoking and life-affirming.8/10",The Great Beauty

He has nevertheless ambitions and opinions about life and the world in his beautiful house in Rome with a view to the Colosseum. But when he reaches 65 he realizes that he has wasted his life in mundane high society parties being much endeared by the women even at that age. He becomes then very disillusioned and seeks often refuge in memories and nostalgia of the past. All this develops itself in beautiful images and scenes of interiors and exteriors and beautiful film framings including of mundane parties and balls. There are also discussions sometimes superficial, sometimes deeper about human nature and the life and behaviour of this or that character. We must not forget that we are among high society members. No worker or proletarian is ever seen. We see a lot of characters sometimes very strange in terms of faces and behaviours.

37,frankde-jong,Better than the original,9,3 October 2020,"In the late 40's and early 50's Jules Dassin made a couple of films paying tribute to big cities. ""The naked city"" (1948) to New York, ""Night and the city"" (1950) to London and ""Du Rififi chez les hommes"" (1955) to Paris. In 2013 Paolo Sorrentino adds to all this his tribute to Rome with ""La grande bellezza"".""La grande bellezza"" is often compared to ""La dolce vita"" (1960, Federico Fellini). This is understandable because the main character is in both cases a journalist who reports about ""the beau monde"". Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni) works for a gossip magazine in ""La dolce vita"". Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo) is art director fot a more serious newspaper in ""La grande bellezza"".Being part of the jet set , Jep has (more than Marcello) also self reflection about the circles in which he operates. In a very painful dialogue he unmasks the snobbery and arrogance in the self image of a female writer.The film starts with the 65th birthday of Jep and therefore it is no surprise that the film is also about coming to terms with ones own mortality. This is brilliantly reflected in the soundtrack which combines the disco of Raffaella Carrà (during the birthday of Jep) with the religious music of Arvo Pärt.At the end of the film Jep comes to the conclusion that the most important moment of his life was more the 40 years ago and that he has been busy caressing his won ego ever since.To conclude, the comparison with ""La dolce vita"" is justified.

38,mossgrymk,great beauty,8,21 December 2020,"Good satire of the Italian glitterati at work and (mostly) play. Love Toni Servillo's performance as the jaded, cynical, sometimes cruel but strangely likable celeb journalist Jep Giambardelli, who's kind of a weird combo of Orianna Fallaci and Bill Maher (to whom Servillo bears a physical resemblance). The problem I have with these kinds of ""My Rich, Successful Life Is So So Empty!"" character studies, though, is that said character is having a bit too much fun suffering. I mean, I'd gladly trade places with Jep if I too could sleep with luscious Italian babes, eat at the best restaurants, have a patio pad overlooking the Coliseum complete with sardonic housemaid/cook, and get to wear those Milan designer clothes. About the only sacrifice Jep makes that I can see is that he walks instead of tooling around Rome in a Lamborghini. Ergo, it's hard to take this kind of a film, as it was ""La Dolce Vita"", completely seriously. Fortunately, director Paolo Sorrentino seems to be in on the joke and has his tongue stuck somewhere in the regions of his cheek, at least in the wonderful party scenes which is where the film really comes alive for me. Give it a B plus for these sequences as well as Servillo's acting.",The Great Beauty
39,proud_luddite,Beautifully Reflective,7,2 September 2019,"Among the elite of modern-day Rome, writer/journalist/socialite Jep Gambardella is celebrating his 65th birthday. Many small scenes follow in which he and others among the upper-class reflect upon the emptiness of their lives and their disappointment in Roman society itself.This film's greatest asset is the directing by Paolo Sorrentino. His use of visuals, camera angles, lighting, and background music creates a truly beautiful reflective experience in this very unique expression of melancholy. The story itself isn't necessarily thin but it's more a series of related small stories pieced together. This type of story-telling makes it difficult to get to know the characters including the main one. Sometimes, it's even hard to keep track. But the method of story-telling makes up for these gaps.Most memorable is a funny scene in which a pretentious ""performance artist"" is being interviewed. It was no surprise to read that Sorrentino (who also co-wrote the film) detests modern art.In the end, the various scenes do lead to a lovely conclusion. And the closing credits are breathtaking. And yes, it is easy to compare ""The Great Beauty"" to ""La Dolce Vita"". There are many similarities but ""The Great Beauty"" remains unique.",The Great Beauty
40,maurice_yacowar,Writer abandons self and vision to enjoy revels.,8,29 January 2014,"In The Great Beauty writer/director Paolo Sorrentino shows he can unleash not just Fellini's generosity of imagination but his courage to be declared self-indulgent. The cornucopia of impressionist scenes may seem incoherent but it offers several unifying themes.For one, the film deals with the difference between self-awareness and self-knowledge. Sorrentino's vast cast personify theatrical behaviour, that is the projection of a self that is not one's own. It represents the illusion of being.The performance artist Talia Concept (Anita Kravos) and the little girl whose action paintings sell for millions show visual art turned into theatre. Where Talia bashes her head into a stone wall the little girl's coerced art is clearly a torture for her.The gentleman entrusted with the keys to all the rich private spaces in Rome is another theatrical, turning the life rooms into spectacles for the privileged night tours. The nobles rented for a party act as if they were the family's traditional enemies; after, at ""home,"" the wife plays the tour tape that tells her girlhood story. Now she's a tourist in her own life.That is also Jep when he continually recalls his first love, who died loving him, not her ""good companion"" husband. Jep is trying to recover the lover, the self, he might have been. He wants to read her diary, the script she lived inside, but her husband threw it away, as Jep has tossed any revelations he might have recorded since his sole publication.Everyone dances here, which means throwing themselves into a frantic activity instead of stopping to think, discover and realize their self. Romano does the latter when he rents a theatre and moves through several ideas of impersonal theatre before doing a public expression of himself. The applause — like his exploiting dream-woman's usual abandonment — still doesn't satisfy him so he throws in his lifelong dream of a Roman triumph and goes back to his home town. As the saintly 104-year old nun explains, she eats only roots because ""Roots are important."" Sorrentino's society is a mass of deracinated characters whose total dedication to the party life successfully evades facing and fulfilling themselves. Being closest to the earth, the dwarf who's a journal editor seems to be the only partier actually working for a living. Of course that level of ""writing,"" journalism, is like the writings of the Fellini hero and like the fashionably shallow plethora of interviews here, a serious compromise of the art.That 2-toothed nun does her own theatre, sitting or standing in feeble stiffness to flatter her adorers, then climbing the giant staircase on her 104-year-old knees. Her custodian imputes to her a more genuine life — serving, washing, feeding the poor 22 hours a day — that is simply unsupported by the theatre we see her perform. But even that saintly self- abnegating service is only another form of theatre, which enables her to find in religious charity an excuse not to examine herself. This religion is an abdication of self. In contrast, the cardinal bound for popehood is obsessed with a different form of self-indulgent appetite, his mania for cooking and for generously sharing his recipes instead of spirituality. Of course, his recipes and robe get him invited to all the finer parties. We watch Jep's responses as he watches all that theatre, frenzied pretence where the examined life should be. The success of his one novel has won him what he wanted, the power to get to the best parties — and to spoil them. Only a couple of times does he rise to spoil them, by doing what a writer should do, expose the skeleton beneath the apparently fine flesh. He anatomizes the woman who vainly claims to make sacrifices as a woman, writer and mom. He reveals the cardinal's vacuity. But for the most part though Jep sees the emptiness in the gauds around him, instead of withdrawing to save himself and to pursue his writer's mission he — joins the dance. His face shows he knows but he still gets on the train.",The Great Beauty

42,bob998,Toni Servillo kept me watching,5,19 May 2014,"Toni Servillo kept me watching this mediocre sub-Fellini movie. The cinematography was elegant in places, I will grant, and the music was often effective, but all in all this is a clumsy attempt to revisit the society better described by Fellini and Antonioni (in Le Amiche and Cronaca di un amore). Scene after scene goes flat because the script is weak; only the superb comic verve of Servillo (this is the first one of his films I've seen, incredible!) keeps the story going at all. When he skewers the pretensions of the female novelist, it's with a twinkle in his eye that I found irresistible. The performer who slams her head into the wall is dealt with in a similar fashion--it's delicious.The picture founders because the writers don't know how to construct a real satire of manners and morals. The entry of the strip club owner is a good example: he doesn't move the story in any direction at all, it's just an excuse to indulge in some more elegant camera-work. I await Toni Servillo's next film eagerly.",The Great Beauty
43,DukeEman,A modern day La Dolce Vita...,8,21 March 2015,"Thank you Paolo Sorrentino for bringing back the style and eccentric filmmaking of Federico Fellini. After seeing the fabulous, La Grande Bellezza, I realised that Fellini's style would have fit perfectly into the modern world of filmmaking. If anything, his style has influenced many a modern day filmmaker, and will continue to do so.Director Sorrentino has done a splendid and creative job in capturing the downward spiral of Jed Gambardella's selfish life, played to perfection by Toni Servillo. Jed resides in the beautifully decaying city of Rome, and moves about the ancient city conversing with other lost souls and false hopes. It is through this sometimes surreal journey that Jed gets closer to understanding his existence, even at the age of 65, when one would expect that you'd have it all worked out by then.A thought provoking tale of a decadent life with all its ugliness in its beauty.",The Great Beauty

Witty conversations and intriguing allusions abound in this irreverent and cerebral journey through the piazzas of Rome as well as the self.Toni Servillo, the star of the impressive, intricate and unique political film Il Divo, deftly becomes Jep. Even digital captioning is not able to keep up with the Italian wit, barbs and words that flow and gurgle like the fast flowing fountains that are all over the city. I wish I was fluent in the language in order to capture more of the meanings and innuendos. Beyond the words there is depth in gazes, gestures and fashionable clothes, and - of course - the deep history and art of Rome. So much to fathom here.

45,Rickting,Jaw dropping art-house drama,9,15 November 2014,"The best foreign movie winner at the Oscars, this art house Italian drama is about an aging socialite who has lived a life of partying for the last few decades but after an old love dies, he reflects on his life and his sense of unfulfillment. This is not my type of film and I didn't expect to enjoy it. Don't expect a lot to actually happen. This is a quietly reflective drama where a lot of it is the main character walking around and interacting with others. It's a very slow and deliberate movie. It couldn't care less about following conventions. If this isn't your thing this isn't the best film for you. If you watch it, just let it draw you in. It does take its time, but the beautiful images start flowing from the first frame. As the character depth heightens and it becomes more and more fascinating, slowly it begins to hypnotize. By the end, it has packed a wallop which is the equivalent of being punched in the face by Dwayne Johnson.This is a very good film indeed. It's a bit indulgent and slow, but that is to be expected of an art-house film. The cinematography is breathtaking and the acting is very good as well. The story is believable and incredibly moving, and ultimately it's a very powerful film. The Great Beauty does take its time, but not in a bad way and although many will find it dull (it definitely has its dull bits) and that's fair enough, but it's hard not to admire it in terms of sheer visual awe and emotional strength. The film feels very unique and special, and is very different from any other film I've seen from the cinematic landfill that was 2013. TGB is an emotional experience overall and although a slow one it has a quiet yet strong power throughout. This tells a believable and very striking story, and Rome has never looked better. Even after the film is over, the visual splendor doesn't stop as the camera floats down a river in Rome.9/10",The Great Beauty
46,rubenm,Definitely not the best European film of 2013,6,8 December 2013,"This film has won four European Film Awards, and is supposed to be the best European film of 2013. When it was released in Belgium, I didn't pay much attention to it. But I wouldn't have forgiven myself for not having seen the best European film of the year, so I decided to go see it after all. It has been playing for a while in Belgium, but fortunately there was a Sunday afternoon screening in my neighbourhood cinema. 'La Grande Belezza' or 'The Great Beauty' is a very suitable title for this film. It is full of beautiful people, moving around in a beautiful city, wearing beautiful clothes. Many scenes are aesthetically very attractive, with original camera angles and nice gliding movements. But at the same time, the film feels empty. It's all form and no feeling. Jep Gambardella, a socialite, writer and journalist, gives a party for his 65th birthday and realizes that he has been living in an artificial world of people showing off, having fun, and trying to impress each other. What's more, he realizes that he himself is the most superficial of them all. 'From now on, I won't waste any more time on things I don't like', he decides, and refuses to watch nude pictures of the woman he has just had sex with. The film shows the cynical Gambardella in a long series of encounters with all sorts of friends and acquaintances. The succession of strange characters, the decadence of the jet set, the beautiful locations in Rome - of course you can't see this film without thinking about Fellini. But Fellini didn't show things just for the sake of it. Paolo Sorrentino does. The film has far too many superfluous and confusing scenes and is far too long. The fountain scene the films starts with is beautifully filmed, but the meaning remains unclear. The birthday party is annoyingly long and keeps on showing the same things. The scene with the giraffe is very Fellini-esque, but doesn't serve a purpose. And so on. How this film could have won the European Film Award for best picture is beyond me. Personally, I would have voted for Asghar Farhadi's masterpiece 'Le Passé' (if it would have been nominated).(Just one more thing: this film has great promotional value for the Italian men's fashion industry. Jep Gambardella is impeccably dressed throughout the whole movie. It makes you want to run to the nearest Corneliani-store and spend a fortune.)",The Great Beauty

48,jackasstrange,"Not really that good, but still a beautiful work",7,22 January 2014,"The Great Beauty received many accolades by being the great foreign film of the year, but I personally thought it wasn't that all that fuzz about it is being deserved at all. It looks like a genuine film, with a good intention(all the films do have a good intention, but that's not the point) and really pass it's intended message perfectly. Despite the name, this film is very pessimist, and is about an old man trying to find a reason to live, since that there is nothing that the life may offer to him that he wasn't already tasted well, the story is told in a very poetic way, sometimes it's vulgar, sometimes its through the cleverness of life but all in all, I didn't find the film well- executed. Sure it has(again) a good message, but I don't know, the things in this film are way too disjointed? I understand that the film is after all, a great homage to the fabulous Italian director Federico Fellini, which works consisted in creating a fantastic and surreal world which served to metaphor for life, and they generally featured a character with an existential problem, just like in The Great Beauty. But again, differently than Fellini, the director of The Great Beauty couldn't accomplish what Fellini did best: making that weird and fantastic world being coherent. And by saying that, know beforehand that The Great Beauty has nothing particularly surreal besides one scene, which occurs near the end of the film. My main problem, is after all, the film being way too slow. There is almost no conflicts or whats or ever, to catch my attention and make me say ""oh that scene was really great"". It may sound like I am expecting a film like 'Transformers' or something, but that's not the case. I am a lover of that kind of existentialist/surrealist films, and sure I can stand through films slower than that, but this film was almost totally uninteresting, apart from the 'weird' scenes. Also, the lack of originality really don't helps. I am not talking about the events, no, there is really a few unexpected things in this film, but the theme is way too overused. Anyways, I just wanted the things to have more movement, since the story was already totally disjointed. I also thought that the actor which interpreted the main character did well, he really sounds like someone intelligent and in a level – arrogant. He did well. What I also liked was the cinematography that is great regardless if I liked the film or not, it's important to recognize that this film is full of great and beautiful images. But anyways, the story is nice, but sure it could've been done better. 7.4/10",The Great Beauty
49,christian94,Grows on you like an erection,8,8 October 2014,"Many commented that this movie is or feels boring. On the other hand it is also hailed as a modern masterpiece. My conclusion is that both are true and not mutually exclusive.The beginning of the movie, from the Japanese tourist intro into the birthday party and extravagant life of Jep is disconnected and disconcerting. It is not until you get into the slow, special, spatial and temporally disjoint rhythm of the movie, with sparse profound words mixed with images, music and blah blah blah gibberish that everything start to come together.A movie that surely requires repeat viewing, it's haphazard and frivolous exterior is indeed filled with deep philosophical, psychological, poetic and artistic aesthetics and themes. The cinematography and editing are spectacular. The music, classical and modern, enthrals, while the various expressions of experimental art oppose the classical art history and architecture of Rome. There is beauty everywhere, but it is the beauty inside we are looking for. The screenplay reveals its beauty in parts and culminates with a savoury ending.This movie has many memorable scenes, a meaningful message and comes out in the end triumphant against the boredom of life.",The Great Beauty
50,wvisser-leusden,reminds me strongly of Fellini's 'La Dolce Vita',8,13 April 2014,"Being 61, I cannot escape to compare the structure of 'La Grande Bellezza' (= Italian for 'the great beauty') with that of another momentous Italian film: Fellini's 'La Dolce Vita' (= 'the sweet life') from 1960.Both films are set against Rome's nightlife, and both are carried by a single male wandering somewhat aimlessly through life. The aimless character of their journey is accentuated by a random-like switching from one scene to another. Pictures that are always beautiful, never deep, and certainly never & nowhere thoroughly investigated.Both films are excellent by their capacity to take the viewer by the hand, leading him or her unconditionally to this beautifully pictured setting. And yes, no place on earth is better suited for such a journey than Rome is -- in 1960 as well as now.As the Vatican is firmly integrated in this town, one cannot escape its prominent influence in films like these. However, one may say that 'La Grande Bellezza' shows itself much softer and less critical towards the Roman Catholic Church than 'La Dolce Vita' does.I end my comparisons by mentioning the world-famous night-scene from 'La Dolce Vita', showing Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg in the waters of Rome's Trevi-fountain. When Mastroianni died in 1996, the City of Rome covered Trevi in black cloth, and stopped its waters flowing. I am anxious to see if 'La Grande Bellezza' ever will meet a comparable honor.",The Great Beauty

And that's precisely what happens in 'La Grande Bellezza'. The movie celebrates the social position of the main character which gives him access to interesting places and persons such as beautiful women, artists, wizards and saints. Yet as in Proust, Jep Gambardella never stops complaining about being too idle or too weak to write down his own novel. But whereas in Proust you are well aware that this is completely fictional (you are actually reading the book that he claims not being able to write) in this movie you don't find hard to believe that this could be the plain truth. The text is so weak that you wonder if the authors actually were too idle to write a real story and they instead decided to astonish you with wild animals in urban settings and breathtaking views of Rome while leaving to fragmented dialogues or diluted flashbacks of meaningful moments in Gambardella's life the task of telling you what you already know, i.e that life is pointless and that this becomes clear to everyone as they age.I'm so unused to Italian movies that I watched it as if it were a foreign film. But I'm from Rome and I think that the rest of the world makes better films.",The Great Beauty
52,kurosawakira,Enthusiasm,9,19 October 2014,"Let's get the most obvious and pressing statement and introductory bluff out of the way: I had procrastinated for some reason to see this film, pushed it aside, until very recently I saw Kiarostami's two new films, the other set in Italy and the other in Japan. Then, for some reason, I found myself in the evidently suitable mood for it. And, truly, ""La grande bellezza"" (2013) is indeed a marvelous achievement in modern cinema.The first reel is such a full-blown hyperactive explosion of fireworks and of all cinematic devices possible that it's a long time I've seen quite anything like it. It's like ""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001), the difference being that Luhrmann takes himself way too seriously in comparison. If one is looking for a definition of fun, in filmic terms, then this might be it: not only are the people having fun, we're having fun because the presentation is so over the top? No, I don't buy it. This isn't over the top where either the immaturity or naiveté of the filmmaker takes full control. This is ironic, yes, full of humanity, but I'd rather call it enthusiastic, not only because it's an appropriate word but because of its etymology: it comes from the Greek ἐνθουσιασμός, ""enthousiasmós"", meaning ""possessed by a god"".Perhaps part of why it works so well is that the visual side of the film has all going for an Antonioni film, but again, the film takes a powerful, visually ironic swerve from the Antonioni's apparent bleak existentialism. This is powerful stuff. Another film right up its alley is Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" (2011), since Sorrentino too finds the past in present tragedy, the doors unlocked by the one door one only walks through once. And whereas Malick too is a serious artist, and among the most seriously ingenious we have, Sorrentino's film has in abundance the life-affirming love for life that not only depicts life but sustains it. It's closer to Fellini, and ""La Dolce Vita"" (1960) pops up in any conversation about it.We laugh at them and with them, and only them are we able to cry with them. This is the great swerve of the film, a tragicomical crescendo from the comical to the infinitely tragic: the vacuity not of life, of conversation, of society, but of self. Seeing it happening all around, as much within as without.And then let's talk about the colours. To say they are lush is to understate. They're somewhere high up where Visconti's ""Il gattopardo"" soars, or Wong's masterful examinations of colour, or Miyazaki's ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" (2001) and ""Hauru no ugoku shiro"" (2004), or Kurosawa's ""Ran"" (1985), where colour takes on a character beyond the function of indicating ambiance or mood, rather channeling the direction of the narrative.And then there's Rome. Having lived in Italy (farther to the North, in Bologna) and having visited Rome and roamed its streets, the film's impeccable presentation of the city in a modern city symphony framework was like a trip down the memory lane: the water, the river, the streets, the luminous sky on a clear evening, the monuments.And then the music. Kubrick and Malick have used music not to annotate but to become part of the film's soul, and so has Sorrentino. The songs he uses are varied, beautifully in- place, integral pieces without which one couldn't imagine the film to be the same. I guess there can be no higher compliment on my part, singularly since this is music that wasn't composed for the film.",The Great Beauty
53,maximkong,"Basically an Art Appreciation, Do not Find it Realistic",3,4 January 2014,"The artistry of this film is a Great Beauty in itself. But in terms of realism, I feel disconnected from the behaviour of the characters. I really wonder if the ""activities"" represent what most middle-aged people (and loaded with cash, of course) would do when they ponder what to spend, or think, through the remainder of their lifespan.I am assuming some of these old guys do not have grandchildren, and are in the arts business, to go through nightlife and play around like a youth fresh into university. Because, common sense will tell you the 'priority list' that old people will do for the rest of their lives - i) spend more time with family, especially with grandchildren, ii) managing investments/ wills, iii) catching up with old friends or attend funerals, iv) probably play around with hobbies that are more relaxing and make more sense than 'night-clubbing', v) travelling. I am not against nightlife for the older generation, but the movie over-emphasized this.By the way, they all look perfectly healthy (no medical appointments??). This is a very obvious point because health is likely to be a daily topic amongst the elderly, but there isn't' a single conversation on health in this movie! BIG BIG minus point. Some guys in their 20s already have more medical problems than the old men and women in this film! I am not an art person and therefore I am giving some leeway that there may be some intention on why the film is designed as such. But, I feel the movie could have been more wholesome. Wholesome-ness is definitely not a beauty found in this movie. More importantly, the age group is totally out-of-whack. I would have enjoyed the movie more if it were people in their 30-40s (i.e. mid-life crisis) but I refuse to believe that it represents the lifestyle of an ageing Roman society. I hope it stays away from winning major int'l awards.",The Great Beauty
54,lucasnochez,Review: La Grande Bellezza (The Great Beauty),6,13 February 2014,"""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."" This remains to be one of my favourite idioms of all time. The beauty of art is very rarely understood unanimously or collectively, instead it becomes an expression of human beings that flourishes through argument, rebuttals and questions. Fortunately, the same can be said with the film in review. One of the many beauties of The Great Beauty remains to be it's amazing ability to allow the perceptions of many to decide the beauty and horror that is contained in it's small, avant-garde shell.More often than not, the film is a collection of images, situations and nuances where it's meaning is just as dumbfounding or interpretative as any abstract portrait or painting. From scenes involving a magician disappearing a giraffe where the payoff is never explained, an opera choir singing whilst an Asian tourist falls face-first, dead, or the image of a capsized boat in the water off the coast of Rome, there are more than just a few instances where the film itself is a colourful and fantastical ode to the late great Federico Fellini. Rather than just being a Fellini wannabe film, writer/director Paolo Sorrentino gives us a glimpse into the many questionable lifestyle formulas within the epicentre of Italy's posh social elites, the city of Rome.The film is driven by way of high-class professional socialite Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), a rousing misogynist, or what he prefers to be called, a misanthrope, whose life since the age of twenty-six has surrounded the snobby upper-class Italian elite and their artistic appetites. Jep is a writer who is still riding the waves of success from his first and only book, L'Apparato Umano (The Human Apparatus), and whose presence is still heavily felt in Rome. Like so many great writers, Jep is completely aware of his potential to impact the lives of others, yet rather than embrace his talent, he prefers to use his status as a dignified God-like scribe for the sake of nothing really. As he struts his fine-tailored suit throughout the underbelly of Rome's busy nightlife and sleeps while Rome's financially struggling lower and middle class work, Jep enjoy his life drinking, smoking, sleeping, eating, socializing, and complaining about the trivial matters that plague the Italian upper-class. As Jep narrates, ""It's all settled beneath the chitter chatter and the noise, silence and sentiment, emotion and fear. The haggard, inconstant flashes of beauty. And then the wretched squalor and miserable humanity. All buried under the cover of the embarrassment of being in the world"". Exactly.Contrary to it's marketing and promotional material, the film itself is beautifully shot, but far from following any sort of linear storyline. Jumping in and out of flash-backs of Jep's youth, the film is a vessel to understanding Italy's obsession with keepin up appearances, and actually has less to do with Jep's life as a whole. The film is loaded with scenes involving examples of ridiculous high art practices; from wall-slamming nude women, knife-throwing gypsy men, and volatile little girls throwing paint cans onto a blank canvas. The Great Beauty is a film whose commentary on the ridiculousness of Rome's posh few are questioned and palpable, not because of it's unbelievability, but more-so for it's deep-rootedness in truth and reality. I have personally never been to Rome, or Italy for that matter, but much like the film itself, Sorrentino allows audience members to envision Rome in the same way he uses it; as a portable backdrop for the countless fashion photo shoots, bizarre street art performers and a stage for the operatic. Aside from the people, there is a richness underneath The Great Beauty, which is its commentary on beauty itself. Dabbing into the world of plastic surgery, clubbing, and high-art, Sorrentino's lens is a tell-all opening to the very haggard and inconstant flashes of beauty that become borderline repulsive and monstrous. Eventually, everyone surrounding Jep becomes more and more inhuman and almost caricature like, far from Jep's initial desires. It is not until one of Jep's previous lovers dies where Jep is, pulled back into the world where everyone, including himself, is in search for the great beauty of life.Although it's title may be The Great Beauty, the film itself becomes a de-glamourization and far- fetched reality of the abusive and overindulgent spectacle of a frivolous and uncaring class of socialites. The Great Beauty is undoubtedly an intricate and wholly cinematic apparatus, but, as Jep says, it is also just a film that highlights Italy's ""blah, blah, blah"" in high manner and fashion.",The Great Beauty
55,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,Paolo Sorrentino's magic.,9,26 May 2020,"When I first saw Paolo Sorrentino's The Consequences of Love, I thought that this was his best film and I didn't expect that there would be another one like it in terms of quality, storyline, photography, and performances. But I was wrong. The Great Beauty (original title: La Grande Bellezza) is Sorrentino's magnum opus, a spectacular visual elegy to the eternal city of Rome as well as a social commentary on the decadence of upper-class social life. The true protagonist of the movie is Rome, a city marked by its ambiguity and multiple semantics. In Sorrentino's fictional universe, Rome is a metropolis that gives birth and at the same time crushes human ambitions and dreams under the veil of endless pointless discussions and interactions between the film's characters. The Italian master auteur focuses on Rome's higher social circles and in the first scene of the movie we watch as a massive fiesta takes place on screen and where we see a vast crowd dancing and laughing enveloped in their cocoon of upper-class social status and celebrity culture. It is at this party that we meet the protagonist, Gep Gambardella, a once-upon-a-time novelist who has written one book forty years ago and nothing ever since. Gep attends many similar parties and he is consumed with this particular lifestyle as he is growing older. His life experience so far has made him a cynic and in some dialogues, he proves to be rather tough with people who attempt to insult or downgrade him (the best example is the excellent roof scene). Gep also likes to wander around Rome where he meets old friends, casual acquaintances or even movie stars like Fanny Ardant. When he hears about the premature death of his childhood amore, Gep will begin to reassess his life, contemplating his past, the missed chances, the mistakes, and the desire to write will resurface.Toni Servillo has to be Sorrentino's favorite thespian as they have collaborated before in masterpieces like Il Divo and The Consequences of Love. Servillo delivers his most stellar performance ever in The Great Beauty and attributes such a cerebral mentality to his character that makes Gep one of the most memorable characters in the contemporary Italian cinema. There is something Fellini-like in both the film's cinematography and characterization even though in an interview he gave, Sorrentino, stated that he respects Fellini too much to say that it was an influence. Nevertheless, one could easily imagine Marcello Mastroianni in the role of Gep and overall mood and tone of the film are heavily reminiscent of Fellini's Dolce Vita. Of course, that doesn't mean that Servillo is not the most appropriate choice for the role of the protagonist as he is definitely on the top-5 of the best Italian actors of all time. Apart from Gep, there are many secondary characters in the film and all the actors give their best, elevating the film's overall grandiosity to sky-high levels.The photography is magnificent, perhaps one of the best I've ever seen on the silver screen, and there are many imposing shots of Rome's elegant beauty. This elegance is pitted against the decadence and vulgarity of the city's aristocracy which is satirized in a brilliant comical manner by the director who is also the screenwriter. The comical aspect is partly present in The Great Beauty and it is counteracted by Gep's somber remarks on a number of themes, such as artistical inspiration, death, modern art , and, of course, the meaning of love. At the end of the film, when he is asked why he hasn't written anything for more than four decades, Gep admits: ""All of my life I've been searching for the great beauty but I never found it"". This overarching sense of futility permeates the film as a whole even though the final moments offer -perhaps- a fading glimmer of hope for Gep and for the audience as well. I believe that this is a film that the viewer has to see more than one time as there is a lot to process and grasp. I saw it two times and I think that I will do it again sometime in the near future as I was stunned by this film. Yes, it is true that Sorrentino has this effect on audiences and that is the reason why he is the best European director of our time. But be warned: this is a slow-moving film, a film that demands the viewer's full attention and it is not recommendable to those who ask for quick, cheap entertainment. Be ready to devote yourselves to the movie and you will be profoundly affected by this Italian gem.",The Great Beauty
56,priyantha-bandara,One of the finest of contemporary cinema,9,27 April 2014,"The Great Beauty is a very deeply sensual representation of a 65 year old man Jep Gambardella and his life, expectations, repents and joys. Mysterious in a very dramatic and unfamiliar way this movie brings a great deal of art in one bag and let the viewer to explore Jep's illusions and realities through a mix of tastes and concepts. At times it seems like the story shatters and runs in all directions but it is like a fine cloth woven in separate pieces that comes to a whole in the hands of a master tailor. And no doubt it is one of the finest of contemporary cinema.Jep (Toni Servillo) is an aging writer who has written one book read by many and bought respect 40 years back. Now he is living a comfortable life surrounded by his party hard aged circle of friends and writing columns in a prestigious newspaper. In a society influenced by connections and the rich and famous flocks with like minds Jep spends the majority of his day active at night. But after his 65th birthday he realizes that his life has being empty for some reason and a sudden encounter with someone that reminds him of his first love stirs his emotions and memories.As mentioned earlier The Great Beauty is a jumble of many sorts of art. It has poems, songs, dances, performance arts as in stage plays and magic, Painting such as modern and renaissance and even sculpture. This many sorts of mixed arts bring in a very bizarre disposition to this movie and the cinematography is superior at each element. The other key player is music. You will hear many types of music one after the other and the emotional beauty is certainly enhanced in each level no doubt. You will get to see the Roman grandeur in perfect cinematic angles and explore some of the fine pieces of sculpture in candle light. And meet various characters of the society with taste of fashion dressed in fine clothing even in funerals. And the journey takes the viewer through vividly lit night clubs and lavishly furnished condominiums and roof tops of the fortunate. All these elements adds spice to Jep's lifestyle filled with witty and at the same time sarcastic dialogues.Leaving the technicalities aside the single most powerful strength of The Great Beauty is its beautiful script and representation of the plot. However it's like a two edged blade where some of you might completely agree and move with the flow while the rest might curse and leave the cinema hall for wasting their precious time. But the latter kind will be seldom as either your hooked or slipped within the first few minutes of the movie. If the journey looks promising you will find many goodies along the way.",The Great Beauty
57,CMTiago,A look at Rome and its way of life,7,31 January 2014,"Upon taking a first glance at Jep Gambardella we see a party king with the ability to make events a success or a failure. After working hard to make sure he achieved this stature, the writer searches for something truly exceptional that has been missing for the past 40 years he lived in the capital of Italy.The Great Beauty is a tale of a city and its people and, how all things considered, there is emptiness in lives of glamor and success. Our main character is a representation of this and as a man who spent his entire adult life in this world of excess yet nothingness, he longs for a change and something to grasp. Having written only one novel as a young man, Jep quickly gives up his novelist ambition, to climb high in social life and achieve what he thought was greatness. The people around him are just as hopeless and share each others company to keep each other in this state of presence. There are three instances that highlight Jep's life evaluation. At first we see him meet a man that married his girlfriend, Elisa, from back when he was still young and hopeful, who has recently passed away. I believe this represents his earlier stage of growth and a more naive way of seeing life and the world. Then while reconnecting with an old friend, he ends up spending time with his friend's 41 year old daughter, who is a washed up stripper who blows money continuously. Now we enter a stage where Jep sort of reflects middle age, and perhaps a time when he began to doubt his way of life, but chose to carry on living the same way. Finally there is a 104 nun that has lived all her life in poverty and has stood up for her convictions throughout her long existence. In this final stage we are presented with a someone that has basically reached her end, and yet continues to work for an objective until her body decides to give in. At this point I think we not only witness the religious points that are forever connected with Rome, but also how one can reach such an advanced age and not only believe to have done the right decisions but also look to continue doing it without accepting death. Overall throughout the film, there are two figures that pop up in every third of the film. A neighbor that eludes Jep, as he later turns out to be a surprise to him. More importantly the constant memory of Elisa and how this writer's life turned out after their separation are a reminder that, no matter how brief it was, great beauty existed in Jep Gambardella's life.Paolo Sorrentino's vision is one that doesn't glorify the high life, but then again it doesn't defend the simple things, because ultimately Jep is as lost as his companions and his attempt to break free fails, as he accepts conformity in the end. The Great Beauty is an interesting movie that is worth watching, yet I didn't embrace it too much, as I found that it wasn't directed at a person such as myself. Perhaps someone who lives or lived this situation might connect with it personally, and especially if that someone knows what Rome feels like. Great beauty is viewed by everyone differently and in this film it doesn't seem like that is possible for these people, at least in the honest way of the concept.Rating 7/10",The Great Beauty

He journeys round Rome, taking in the sights and seeing them anew, reflecting on all that is and that has been. This film celebrates Rome, Fellini, and a hedonistic, poetic lifestyle of an elite, at the same time questioning such excess and throwing up existential challenges for its protagonist. Visually sumptuous and unashamed, the script also has poignant and incisive moments. The protagonist's upstairs, aloof neighbour, at first enigmatic and majestic, turns out to have an all too prosaic backstory. A sniping, corrosive party-dweller is cut down to size by invective delivered with sniper-like precision and calm. This is a film to give yourself over to and indulge in.

60,fredberglyle,THE GREAT BEAUTY of Italian Cinema,8,22 February 2014,The Great Beauty could take home the Oscars for the best foreign film this coming week. I felt like a colorful revisit to my all-time favorite Fellini's Dolce Vita seeing this. The lead character too reminded me of Marcello Maestro. The movie in which the old-lead character searches for the real beauty in his life lets us view the admirable beauty of Italian Cinema itself. I'm not an Italian so am unable to appreciate certain hidden meanings that the director. The movie contains nude scenes and very few violent instances so not for children (anyways children may not appreciate this kinnda movies).The bottom line : A must watch for Fellini's movie admirers like me.

61,JoeKulik,A Cinematic Masterpiece !!!,10,20 August 2015,"Paulo Sorrentino's The Great Beauty (2013) is just such a cinematic masterpiece on so many different levels.It is so lyrical in composition that I would have to call it a cinematic poem.Visually this is an extraordinarily beautiful film. The cinematography is very innovative and creative. The editing, especially the abrupt shifting into new, different scenes is radical, but skillfully done to great artistic effect. The use of lighting is very creative. The combination and blending of diverse settings ranging between the classic architecture and art of Rome, to modernistic nightclubs is just wild. There is also just such a broad palette of intriguing imagery in this film.The story is about a bon vivant , who wasted his potential to be a serious writer by spending his adult life on the upscale party circuit in Rome. After his 65th birthday, he seems to have serious doubts about the meaning of his life, and begins drifting from one scene to another, wondering about the sense of it all, until almost magically returning to the setting of his first love as a young man, where he seems to pull it all together for himself.The dialogue has some deep philosophical overtones and, generally, the film reflects on the meaning of a life spent pursuing material pleasure, as opposed to the meaning of a life spent pursuing one's own personal values. This film squarely reflects on that aspect of the human condition where, in the face of advancing age, and the prospect of impending death, one reflects on the past seeking a meaning, a significance to one's life.The whole film seemed to exude, to radiate a distinct, but unrecognizable atmosphere for me, very close to the nostalgic, and the reflective.The Great Beauty is just a classic instance of Great Art, in my opinion.",The Great Beauty
62,indiedavid,Complete Disappointment,3,7 February 2014,"Have you ever been to a restaurant that is trying way too hard to be fancy and unique? if so, you have already experienced this film. I waited an hour for something redeeming to happen but it never did. I was stuck for 2.5 hours, watching vignettes of contrived dialogue and attempts at artistic cinematography that contributed nothing to the already very weak story line. I am baffled by the great reviews for this film. I presume the people who gave it high ratings are either unsophisticated film fans or people who have been sadly deprived of true cinematic art. The writer obviously collected dozens of various bizarre scene concepts over a period of many years and finally thought he had discovered a way to cleverly assemble them to tell a story. It's really too bad that he has such a limited vision since the premise for the story had tremendous potential. About 20% of the audience walked out well before the end and the remaining were completely tuned out and visibly agitated.",The Great Beauty

It is sometimes too much to handle when the painful irony and the flashes of inevitable death flicker through each vignette. A stylish italian man taking a long mental trek, but with the spectre that the best has passed. It's a treat, the script is good. The shooting is indulgent. The pathos just drips and drizzles its way across the sets. It is a bit too much - but this is unbridled Italian opera, so of course it's too much. Beautifully sad.",The Great Beauty

65,andrewburgereviews,"""What job do you do?"" ""Me? I'm rich."" ""Great job.""",9,12 December 2019,"Paolo Sorrentino is by no means the reincarnation of Frederico Fellini. But nonetheless, he gets as close as everyone has ever been. In truth, no one can match Italian cinema in the way it approaches shallowness, emptiness and elitist ignorance. Here, Sorrentino does just that as he explores Jep Gambardella, an Italian journalist and somewhat of a gigolo as he reaches 65 and a second midlife crisis--or maybe this IS the midlife crisis, as spiritual realization tends to arrive late when you have no worries in the world.Not only lack of worries, but being blinded by the light. Not an actual religious light, but the neon lights of the many parties he attends to in Rome. And after the party is over, he sits on the very elitist lounges looking at a very elitist sight of a very elitist Rome discussing very elitist novelties of a somewhat high culture. But Jep, portrayed by the brilliant and theatrical-trained Toni Servillo is the only one smart enough to see just how much of a meaningless void his life is. He does not talk much, yet his observations of the world allow him to spew some very down-to-earth truths. Jep claims he wanted to be the ""king of the high life"" and he has achieved that. But at 65 years old, the movie finds him at a point where he realizes how many years he's wasted and how much he'd like to change his life.In a scene in which he talks to a magician which he knows--he knows everyone in Rome by the looks of it--as the magician discusses his vanishing trick, claiming he can make a giraffe disappear, Jep asks him, perhaps for once, not driven by ration but by his most inner desires: ""Can you make me disappear?"" Throughout the film, Jep never lets his guard down, always looking as if he enjoys his life, but you can feel he doesn't. The shallowness I am talking about is found in the many frames which are truly full of beauty. So much so, that they can help you forget about anything. Is this idealistic polished visual glass that Italian movies are built upon, from time to time letting us see through and beneath it.Jep, then, is looking for the past. Why? Perhaps to retrace his steps, trying to find how he'd get here, hoping that if he can reach the entrance he could go through it the other way around and exit. So, he goes to a brothel where he has not been in for 30 years. There, he meets an old friend and falls in love with his daughter for which he might feel more than lust. But this is ambiguous, in the same way his answers to his spiritual questions are. When he meets a cardinal and a toothless nun, who is supposedly a Saint, he realizes that the bulk of his life is too big to be changed so he accepts it. This ""nothing"" is his life.It nonetheless feels both righteous and sad to realize no amount of material goodwill can replace humanity. Sure, the idea has been tossed over and preached around for ever. But when is executed which such insight, flamboyance and carried with such actorial skill, is nonetheless a welcoming addition.",The Great Beauty

This is just my opinion, but I think The Great Beauty was one of the worst of 2013. It's almost all spectacle and almost no substance. There is no story to speak of and little character development; just two hours and twenty minutes of mostly unrelated scenes showing the decadence of Rome's affluent. The movie reveals less of the city itself than you might think based on the reviews. And many of the scenes are at night, limiting what you can see. Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), the main character, is one of the few people in the film who are halfway likable. Most of the other characters are types whom you would be happy never to meet in real life. Servillo has a very expressive face, and I'm sure he would be interesting to watch in a better movie. But here he is forced to wander aimlessly through scene after vacuous scene. Supposedly, Jep is taking stock of his life now that he's reached his 65th birthday. You keep expecting him to have some kind of epiphany, but there is little evidence of it on the screen.",The Great Beauty
69,i_ianchev,La Grande Bellezza,10,15 June 2014,"The sense of fulfillment...The enthralling film piece of writer/director Paolo Sorrentino is a must see for every sensible person on this good Earth. And I must say, I felt quite fulfilled when I watched it. I hesitated to write about it for a long time only because I wanted to have enough time to think in through and to depict it in a proper review. But after all the hesitation the story of Jep Gambardella is the story almost every self aware human being, so I am pretty sure that I will never be able to describe such a wonderful movie. One has to watch it to be able to feel all the morals of its story.Yes, we follow Gambardella through his journey as a famous socialite in Rome, but more importantly - we follow him with our own memories and dreams. I cannot imagine that there will be a sensible person who will not relate to any of the various experiences the main character is presenting to us. Life is just so vibrant and meaningful that we have all had at least one such occasion in our lives where we struck the same chord in our hearts as Jep does.So why is all the fuss? Well, as with all the best movies out there - this success happens all because this movie is geniously telling us to accept and live our lives as they are. Yep, that's it. All the misery and distress in life has no meaning for us when we feel or remember the small and short moments of happiness, love and felicity in our lives. Yes, the everyday life is burying these moments beneath tons of misfortune, but we humans are creatures of hope and love, so we can and will only strive to achieve what happens rarely - pure moments of happiness - the jewels of this beautiful world. These are the creations of our mental strength and spiritual longevity. And no matter how hard we try to convince ourselves that the society and the world are changing for worse, in ourselves we know that it will get better eventually. Because we know, we have felt it before - no matter how much disorder and emptiness there is, there will be always moments of fulfillment which will enlighten our path towards hope and creation. Our imagination is after all the best part of our characteristics model as species.I must also say that the way this movie is shot and musically backed up - it is marvelous. Just go and enjoy it!

70,danielmartinx,A great and beautiful film,9,27 April 2014,"I went into this film without knowing what to expect, but because of my love of Italian film in general, I sat down to watch it. The camera work is incredible, and the surface of things is captured with a fluid and graceful style. Composition, quick cuts, juxtaposition, tableaux of great beauty -- the film looks spectacular, and I was in awe of the visual mastery.Jep is a wonderful protagonist, with his qualities of Des Esseintes from «À rebours» and a little Karl Lagerfeld and Versace mixed in. The soundtrack is evocative, emotional, fresh. Jep has a warm humanity in spite of his icy reserve. He is funny and self-critical, but also deeply in love with himself and his own pleasures. He has lived and watched, and late in life he finds that he has perhaps watched too much and missed out on the meat of life.The person I watched this film with was absolutely aghast at Jep's self-pitying and narcissism, but I myself (being older) saw a sadness in this film. Nostalgia sits uncomfortably in our minds when we have wasted our lives, however beautifully. Jep is at a turning point. My only quibble with the film was the somewhat facile and predictable final scene, but hey. You take what you get. The film's merits far outweigh any small imperfections.Perhaps the uplift at the end of the story arc is what the film truly needed.

71,flickernatic,"Intriguing, sensuous movie-making of a high order.",8,13 September 2013,"This lengthy (142mins) intriguing, complex movie follows the reflections of former novelist, Jem Gambardella (Toni Servillo), as he contemplates his past and current life, a life, it would appear, of lost opportunities both personal and professional. As a member of the wealthy elite of Roman society, he participates in their empty pastimes; parties fuelled with drink and drugs, bizarre art events and casual sexual encounters with beautiful but soulless women. Gambardella is both participant and observer, watching himself as much as his associates, mysterious animals trapped in the gilded cage that is Rome with all the stunning beauty of its architecture, fountains, sculptures, and paintings. We are shown a funeral where Gambradella acts out the etiquette he has just been describing to us; a dinner with a cardinal who seems more interested in food than faith; a saintly nun of extreme age mounting a stone staircase on her knees and crawling painfully onwards and upwards towards an image of Christ . . . Everywhere, life presents contradictions, material and spiritual, emotional pretence and genuine feeling, the Eternal City and its mortal inhabitants, . . .If all this sounds too heavy, everything is carried along by a welter of gorgeous images complemented by music that varies from the ethereal to hefty thumping dance beats. And the actors' performances are never less than utterly convincing.At one of the parties as the massed participants enter into yet another conga-style dance, Gambardella remarks that 'we have the best trains in Rome because they don't go anywhere.' Everything comes back to where it starts and ends where it began. So in the long final credits sequence we float languidly beneath the bridges of Rome, left to contemplate the setting in which we first encountered the genial but disillusioned Gambardella. This is an sumptuous, sensuous, fascinating movie which for me at least probably needs more than one viewing to fully appreciate.

Does it herald a new wave of Italian cinema? I wish but it's a little premature to say that.

75,Board,A film of great beauty,8,3 October 2013,"The analogy presented several times in this film is that Proust wanted to write a book about nothing. That is also what the director of this film has done, and what the main character has done with his own life. This is a film about nothing, but of course still about something – the main character Jep. The film is simply just about this character and how he spends his time. Jep has self-reflection, he's honest, doesn't take things so seriously, and he doesn't try to convince himself that he's something that he's not. Although one of his snobbish, bitter and self-righteous acquaintances annoys him, he doesn't let it bother him too much, and he doesn't say anything about it until she asks him to. He lives a happy, carefree life and is not consumed with worries. Unlike the most of us who ""spends the summer making plans for September"" as one of the characters say, Jep ""looks for the great beauty"" by living in the present an enjoying everything beautiful around him – paintings, food, birds, churches, trees, the ocean, etc. He finds joy in this moment and not in the future. It is actually quite inspiring to watch. But there is nevertheless something missing. Life basically has two missions: Accomplish your dream (whether through work or through raising a family) and find companionship (whether with a partner or with friends), and while Jep has certainly enjoyed his time in Rome, he hasn't achieved any of those two goals. Sex with someone new is not something beautiful shared with another person for him, but simply an everyday thing that's part of his lifestyle. I found this to be one of the key themes in the film. Jep tries to find ""the great beauty"" in life but hasn't found the greatest one of them all: love. He has gone through life partying, shagging, smoking and enjoying, but has never found the woman he loves, nor had any children.All of these characters are trying to find a place where they belong, but none of them are really successful. Most of them want to be accepted by the right crowd or the right woman, but fails in a hierarchy where you can never reach the top. As the movie progresses, more and more people leave Rome as they haven't found the great beauty of love either. One doesn't even want to bring his furniture but just leaves everything behind. Apparently, he hasn't accomplished or accumulated anything there that he would want to remember. So, it's also a critique of modern day Rome and all its citizens' love of being hip. It's elegantly done, and especially the dialogue is beautiful, poetic and well-written.Another reference to literature I found was that the main character and some of the other characters remind me of the three main characters in Oscar Wilde's ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" (the character in this film who wants to stage a play would be Basil Hallward).The biggest drawback of this film is its length. A film about nothing that lasts almost two-and-a-half hours is simply too long. Had it been 30 or 45 minutes shorter it would have been a more pleasant view. The film starts out as a beautiful feel-good film, but ends up as a sad tragedy – with some hope though. It's never too late to make a change.",The Great Beauty

It could sound a little too much, but there has rarely been a movie portraying its time, people and place in a more inventive, fun, clever and aesthetic way. Obvious parallels can be made to La Dolce Vita, which is an obvious model throughout the movie (some scenes are clear homage to the Fellini masterpiece), but the incredible thing is that this movie is not diminished by this parallel, it is a great new / updated interpretation of that same idea of cinema. Actors are superb as the cinematography. At times surreal, at times very funny, at times cynic, ironic, dramatic and in the end poetical and incredibly enjoyable and inventive.

77,martinlucas-469-207968,A delicious menu of rich and fulfilling insights,9,2 May 2020,"Many reviewers seem to think this film is meaningless hodge-lodge of exotic images, or a rip off of La Dolce Vita or 81/2, far from it. In this mesmerising and highly coherent film the key characters all have in common that they have essentially lost their way, they delude themselves about who they are and what they have achieved. Their lives are like a meaningless wild party in which they distract themselves. For example a character describes a conga dance as, ""the best train dance in Rome"", as they all go round and round to no purpose.
Jeb, the key character knows he has failed to be brave enough to write more than one successful book years ago, so has assumed the character of an elegant cynic and a critic, not only of the arts but relentlessly of everyone around him and all their rituals. He can be truly cruel..He destroys an old friend at a supper part and a fragile performance artist. He can't recognise the real talent and commitment of an inspired and unpretentious child painter.
He only really trusts one or two people: he allows himself to speak in his original Neapolitan rough accent to his faithful cook. He trusts his editor because her stature means she can only go so far with self deception. She will always be a small person whatever she accomplishes.
Some people offer hope of redemption: a glamorous but tragic 42 year old who wants to be an eternal stripper for example:he wants to care for her rather than have sex with her but just as he begins to find some real feelings for her, the stripper dies.
Now he wants to somehow discover the 'trick' becoming authentic again. He asks a magician can he really make things disappear. He asks a cardinal who has become a faux chef if he really does exorcisms. Theres hope in a saintly nun, appalling ugly, but profoundly tranquil,with the ability to attract wild birds (and the guts to crawl up stairs at 104),she is all that Jen and his many alienated contacts are not.

78,zacknabo,Truly a Great Cinematic Beauty,10,30 September 2016,"La Grand Bellezza or as known in English speaking countries as The Great Beauty is my pick for the best film of 2013, periodand it would most certainly be on my top ten list of movies released between the years of 2000-present. The Great Beauty, by Paolo Sorrentino (The Family Friend, Il Divo, This Must Be the Place) is a beautiful film, directed and photographed to perfection, but does not just simply rely upon its ability to visually strike the viewer; it is a philosophical investigation into the mind and life of the films main character Jep Gambardella, an aging socialite, the finest of party thrower and famous journalist (who once wrote a successful novel that he wrote as a young man but never followed up). The film is also an examination of Rome, of the high society and the high art bourgeoisie that inhabit the city. Taking a cue from the neo-realistic classics of the Italian film scene of the '50s and '60s, it juxtaposes the wandering, idle lives of the livers of the decadent, excessive life to that of the religious and spiritual aspects of Rome—two dichotomist elements that have always been central to the legendary city.Most criticism that has arisen against this masterpiece has come from Italian critics, but there have been other detractors as well, though they are few and far between. Most of the negative criticism boils down to one simple idea: It isn't a great movie because it is simply a rip-off of Fellini's classic La Dolce Vita. But in this case, the critics have missed their mark. While this film is clearly an homage that takes very much from the highly baroque post-neorealist era of Italian cinema 60 years earlier, it is much too simple to say, 'Oh, this is just La Dolce Vita sixty years later.' The Great Beauty is its own film. Yes, it shows that things have not changed much since Marcello Mastrionni wandered haplessly from party to party in La Dolce Vita. It also comments on the fact that the city has always been in this turmoil of polarity for centuries—Rome is always vibrant and excessiveit is always dyingit is always sentimental in its religious attachmentand it is always being reborn or reinvented in some way—as modernization tends to do. The main thing (or one of the main things) which The Great Beauty does is answer the question that Fellini left us with at the end of La Dolce Vita: How can a person live a good, substantial, important, and moral life in the midst of a nihilistic existence. Quickly into the film we see the spiritual dilemma that our lead character has as his 65th birthday comes and passes, leaving him asking the questions: What am I doing? What has my life been for? Has it been in vain? Looking through the lens of Kant, Jep is an immoral man and living an empty existence. Plato would say that Jep is almost always being dominated by his desires. But if we look at the film through the eyes of Utilitarianism, whom in the Hume-ian tradition see human beings as mostly motivated by desire and passion; Jep is a utilitarian creature that's primary objective is to maximize pleasure and avoid pain. This still does not stop Jep from questioning his existence and that existence of his friends (amongst many other things). The Great Beauty is too large of an onion to peel in just one small review, but one thing is for certain this film has everything one could want in a film: mastery of the visual, an orgasm of color, explorations of spirituality, nihilistic sensibilities, love, history, philosophy, sociology, psychology, memory, curiosity, the spirit of life and how to live with the past. The Great Beauty is one of the finest films I have ever watched (and I have watched a good many); it is certainly one of the best films of the past fifteen years and is the best film that I have seen (this part is important—that I have SEEN) come out of Italy since the late-'70s as the neorealist movement was long dead and the old Italian masters began to age. If The Great Beauty is an indicator of things to come from director Paolo Sorrentino then I cannot wait to be witness to the rest of his career.",The Great Beauty

That is a stupid cliché, because I've just come from seeing it and I should have waited until its effects have subsided. One of the most gratifying films I've seen in many years. It is like staying up all night talking at an outdoor cafe in the shadow of the Trevi with the love of your life. Its not easy for one without much Italian as the words come at you and the images are equally strong and your eyes get a work out.

80,marais-alexander,"Beautiful, beautiful filmmaking",10,18 January 2014,"While I was initially hesitant about the piece, I went into the theatre leery and came out amazed. This is an awesome film, very, very moving, very subtle, complex, mysterious, and deep. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but for those who appreciate more than just violence, sex, and death it's a thoughtful, funny, and tender reflection of a life never really lived until the birth of a revelation. It's even a bit dark at some points, and very, very surreal. The cast of people aboard alone is a reason to see it. The actors picked blend into their roles, and you aren't wondering who X playing Y is, they're just Y. It's also quite erotic, but lacks the graphic sex scenes and in-your-face psychosexual drama most films of this kind require. The cinematography is also something to write home about. Beautiful visual effects. For anyone with a visual eye, this is quite a treat. It's the kind of movie to take your girlfriend to, your mother, even the grandmother. There's nothing about this film that thoughtful viewers won't love. It's a surreal, fresh, funny, and fabulous masterpiece. A milestone in Italian cinema. The only other Italian film I've seen is Mother of Tears, which is quite different. But I'll be sure to keep an eye out for more post-Fellini cinema. It's quite something. Just go for it. 10/10.",The Great Beauty
81,asen-75377,The Great art,9,24 June 2020,"A masterful filmmaking, written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino seems at first to be a haphazard collage of images and sounds, but it somehow all fits together perfectly..a merry celebration of mankind's transient mortality.
The story revolves around An ageing writer has spent many years seducing his way through the lavish nightlife of Rome for decades, but after his 65th birthday, he starts to look past the nightclubs and parties to find a landscape of exquisite beauty. Sorrentino perfectly gives the message through the attracting side as well as hideous side of this Rome.
The city we are watching is an imaginary Rome, breathtakingly beautiful and impassive, unscathed by its actual urban decay, its ugliness, by the corruption of a large part of its political class, and the despondency of the civic society; the camera lingers on its historical facades, bridges, squares, from the most famous sites to the most secluded ones, infusing its gaze with a magical sense of wonder.
Sorrentino said about this film that it's not about Rome, It is mostly about human frailty and alienation - from oneself and from others - and it is about a country's malaise. It is, lastly, about the means used to convey this malaise: art, music, personal and collective memory, friendship, and love.
If you love Fellini's La Dolce Vita, then I'm sure that you'll like this one. Definitely one of the best films that Italy has given to the world",The Great Beauty

It is insufferably lengthy (two-and-a-half hours!), nothing of any significance happens, the main character, an anti-hero improbably named ""Jep"" (short for what? such a name does not exist in Italian) wanders around in a daze, looking like a not particularly intelligent zombie. The whole exercise is redolent of Fellini at his worst (superficial characters, boring scenes in glitzy environments dressed up as 'daring', pseudo-philosophical dialog without any worthwhile content).

83,hamass-mujadid,Sail Through The Bridges of Divinity,10,26 March 2015,"""To travel is very useful, it makes the imagination work, the rest is just delusion and pain. Our journey is entirely imaginary, which is its strength.""I Travel and Life Yodels. Now pick the first letters of each word of the first sentence of this paragraph. What'd you get? Yep, The Great Beauty is about all of it. Literally, it's about Rome, but technically, it's about the Italy and intellectual composition of human coordinates (try linking it with biology.)Festivity of sixty-plus magnates, bodily exposure of twenty-somethings, progressive beat, giggle, perversion, dance, royalty, exuberance, and lavishness—Jep Gambardella's sixty-fifth birthday party. No one knows anything but craze of midnight shaking. Everybody has lost any sense of reality, and is whole-heartedly infused into the regularity of joy. Midway through the party, shoulder-shaking, widely laughing Jep turns towards the screen, and you know he's going to shoot up the evaluation meter. Jep's repute is amplified through the nightlife of a rooftop. He's greeted, hugged, kissed, and danced with. Fellow shooting ""stations of lives"" admire, honor, and respect the journalist. Jep's life has so far been a long-stretched cycle of royalty, partying, and ""onerously"" enjoying. But his sixty-fifth birthday brings a new phase into his life—the phase of enjoying the artistic beauty surrounding him; the phase of Italy in its truest self. The Great Beauty is about a reformed and itinerant aesthete whose personality, influence in all commercial spheres have brought him respect and access to everything. The cigarette smoking novelist goes through the various practices—religious, customary, social, ethical, philanthropic—within his country.The enthralling anecdote adventures audiences through a journey of positivity, archival excellence that Italy possesses, virtue, dignity, honesty (and sometimes ruthlessness) in conversations, and obliviousness with which the world goes about. It engenders truth about human conscience and affirms Rome as just not a catch that a lay-man would think. The essence of sentiments and artistic apotheosis are shown at numerous places—unceasing kissing for ten days, Jep exposing Stefania to the truth about herself, neighbor's arrest and disclosure about himself and his motive, disappearance of giraffe, girl's painting, Ramona's late-night cruise with Jep into Rome's finest sculptures and artworks with top-secret keys, and Jep's threadbare girlfriend's ""now there's something I want to show you.""—throughout the movie. The Great Beauty deals with the minds of observers, and of all critical minds; it's a gift to those who have this deep-rooted desire of exterminating the misery that prevails this ruled-by-choice world and seeing the hidden truth of the omniscient being that engendered everything (this may fluctuate with religious beliefs.) Nothing is impervious to human comprehension abilities, and if pondered upon strenuously, all unimportant elements expose the complexities of human genome. We're all born to experience, but that experience will blunt out into booze and smoke if that's our predilection, which only makes the ruled-by-choice privilege a compromise. If however, we see our surroundings with keenness and search for novelty, then we can see god lying naked on our sofa—that's how close everything is to the truth about universe. And believe me, try seeing things without seeing them—you'll actually create them in some far-off space. Then, you can begin your adventure and scrap out all the rest. At no point does one start to feel light-hearted. One may feel cathartic, but that is again by the profound tension between space, time, and civilization. Jep's eventual preference from Rome's busiest gables to its serenest corners ship dabblers into forth-dimension, the only difference being the lifelike composition of this dimension, rather than the supernova mess we so ebulliently run for. Once you're there, there's no way out, and you start seeing things from a whole different angle; it's something like this: Mozart pulsating his orchestra behind you in the boat you're rowing through the rivers of heaven. That's not it, you've angel-rings and a harp too. Don't beat with the bible, instill it.",The Great Beauty
84,De_Sam,"la Grande bellezza is not an Italian neorealist film, even if my film theory professor says so",7,28 February 2018,"Film theory professors are inclined to force their students to find and reflect on nonsensical connections, such as mulling about the relationship between a recent Italian film and the most historically important Italian genre. This was my try to integrate La Grande Belezza in the frame of Italian neorealism.Firstly, a clear definition of 'genre' is needed to approach Italian neorealism from this perspective. Structural film theorists created the term 'genre' in order to detect underlying patterns in a group of otherwise unrelated film texts in opposition to the prior focus on the oeuvre of a distinguished director (Altman, 2006). Given their origin, it is logical to assume 'genres' are contained -and thereby defined, wholly within the film text. Altman refutes this seemingly independent nature, stating that critics and spectators themselves generate and modify mental expectations for each genre (2006). Accordingly, the context, in other words the social and political situation surrounding the film text, is at least partly responsible for the generally accepted meaning of a particular genre. In the continuum from text-dependent to context-dependent genres, a specific genre is situated near the extreme of the context side, namely Italian neorealism.To elaborate, the Italian neorealism was a reaction to the propagandistic use of film during the fascist regime of Berlusconi from 1922 to 1945 (Wagstaff, 2007). The Italian film directors of the immediate post-world war II strove, similar to many counter-movements, to a complete opposition of the prior film production. The realistic aspect of their films is therefore not solely based on an aesthetic reason, but also on political and social motivations. Ben-Ghiat has even stated that the Italian neorealist cinema was part of the transition period of Italy towards a democratic structure, film was more suited than any other medium at the time to express the need to reintegrate the humanist ideals of the Enlightenment into the national image and culture (2008). Contrastingly, Altman has noted in his article of 2006 that some historians have linked the realistic nature of the neorealist movement to a forced aesthetic due to the absence of production materials and general poverty. Bazin diverges from this purely practical view as he evaluates the neorealist films as a reminder that realism is in fact an aesthetic choice. He attributes the choice for this aesthetic with political reasons, relating the Italian neorealist movement to the revolutionary cinema of Eisenstein, Pudovkin and Dovzhenko (1967). Although on an aesthetical level the neorealist cinema is more similar to the social realist cinema under Stalin.In comparison, Paolo Sorrentino's main aim in La Grande Bellezza (2013) could be deemed to be similar in its intention, i.e. presenting the social and political reality of a specific place and time. Additionally, In terms of space it has overlaps with Roberto Rossellini's Roma, città aperta (1945) and Vittorio De Sica's Ladri di biciclette (1948). However, even though La Grande Bellezza contains many connections with Italian neorealism on a textual level, no film critic or spectator would ever deem it to be a neorealist film. The context of post-world war II Italy is too strongly interwoven with the label of 'Italian neorealism'. It is therefore impossible to make another neorealist film, no matter how closely it follows the aesthetics and content. In light of the previous conclusion it seems to be more productive to view Italian neorealism not as a genre such as it was defined at the beginning of this essay, but as a film movement that liberated the Italian film production from its propagandistic abuse by the fascist regime. Italian neorealist films had to strive for simplicity in order to achieve this goal of purification, thereby being forced to limit their possibility of content and aesthetics (Bondanella, 1993). However, since the context has changed filmmakers are now no longer bound to these strict rules when they want to convey a realistic portrayal of the contemporary social and political situation. Plus, Hsu writes in his article of 2006 about the recent trend of incorporating many different genres in a single film text and the overall blurring of the distinct dividing lines between genres. These circumstances suggest the unlikely nature of any filmmaker restricting himself to the narrow regulations of the genre of Italian neorealism. La Grande Bellezza, which displays influences of the films of Rossellini and De Sica yet incorporates a greater variety than just those sources, is more common.Specifically, Sorrentino's film contains surrealistic scenes, adopts stylistic schemata from the CinemaScope aesthetic of the early American widescreen, plays with colour contrasts to add symbolical elements to the scenes, references the visual style of other media such as music videos, and contrasts wildly varying tones and atmospheres throughout its runtime. In conclusion, regarding the style of filmmaking La Grande Bellezza is as far removed from the simplistic archetype of a neorealist film as possible. A more apt comparison is the bombastic and multiperspective Roma (1972) by Fellini. The consensus in genre theory dictates that genres change over time as they are reassessed and redefined by all involved agents. A genre that is not able to change due to its dependency on the context, as is the case with Italian neorealism, is therefore destined to die out. In the specific case of Italian neorealist cinema many film critics and theorists point to De Sica's Umberto D. (1952) as the end point of the movement. However, Paolo Sorrentino and many other international filmmakers have proven that even though Italian neorealism has ended as a genre, it is still influencing contemporary film production and this will likely continue in the future. The fundamental motivation of the neorealist filmmakers was to liberate cinema, a goal in which they succeeded. Other directors have opted to celebrate that freedom, instead of clinging to the movement that provided their freedom. La Grande Bellezza is a good example of a film made in this liberated style thanks to the collection of influences that Paolo Sorrentino integrated within his work.Altman, R. (2006).

85,sergicaballeroalsina,Manierismo Vivace,9,14 January 2019,"When one looks for the meaning of Mannerism, one finds a definition that could fit perfectly with a review that explains what happens with this film.
Of course, if I made a copy paste of that definition that would be breaking the commitment with originality one makes when writing a review.
Precisely that, originality and copy, is what all this is about.
The definition of Mannerism is problematic. You can begin by explaining that it reproduces or imitates the style, the manner, of the Renaissance Grand Masters. This did not mean any demerit at a technical level. In fact it was an art that pursued technical excellence, virtuosity.
The visual game that Sorrentino proposes about proportions, symmetry and scale, resembles what could have been the update on Fellini's filmmaking.
Extravagance, decadence and erotic refinement appear as other possible definitions of Mannerism. In La Grande Bellezza, the Dolce Vita of a certain intellectual elite gives us an aesthetic impression that does not leave us indifferent. It speaks of desire, taboo, pleasure and distraction. Of the last layers of hedonism. It shakes us through its sensuality, its movements, the costumes and music, laughter and pleasure. It excites us, it causes us vertigo. It makes us vibrate. It does not explore the limits of beauty but it questions them. ""At my age, beauty is not enough."" The contrast between the exalted solemnity of the formal and the exploration of a certain suffering of helplessness and loneliness in its characters is recurrent in Sorrentino's movies: Renaissance architecture to frame the existential void of contemporary snobs. Throws the value of apparent beauty to the void, to the inevitable disappearance of life and illusion. To decline and death. The dreams and the miraculous are, perhaps, the last springs to which Jep Gambardella can hold on to continue believing in life and art. Very debtor of Guido in 8 ½, very Italian.
Finally there is a positive definition for Mannerism. For its value as a self-reference of art itself. The History of Art has progressed constantly in this way. For the one that runs between the homage and the copy.
The originality and the unprecedented are two of the things that I value most in movies but also ""the roots are important"". That's why I celebrate this electric, very powerful, revision of the genius and the grace of Fellini.",The Great Beauty

87,mehmet_kurtkaya,Italian existential masterpiece riding the collapse of Rome -and the West,9,11 February 2014,"It was a few weeks ago, within the first few seconds of the trailers I had understood it was a movie by one of the two greatest Italian directors of our time Paolo Sorrentino, the other being Nanni Moretti. A few seconds later I have thought this could be a movie on Il Divo's most memorable scene for me, the party and the dance of Toni Servino's character and I was very happy Sorrentino elaborated on that. And few seconds later Fellini came to my mind, 8 1/2 that is, long before the trailer ended.So I was very eager to go see this movie. And it turned out even better than I had anticipated.If one should think of Fellini, The Grande Belazza would be more of a Dolce Vita whose characters has run its course, like Rome itself, rather than 8 1/2. It is more international and more political but certainly not enough for our times.Such beautiful imagery, such great acting and directing. The movie flows and shines before our eyes like the Mediterranean under the sun.Sorrentino revisited his favorite theme of life, death and love many years after the Consequence del L'amore but surpassed it. He is working with Toni Servino again along with other aging artists to great effect.Existentialism has its dose of cynicism and possibly being aware of this he criticizes himself as artists picking on things rather than feeling about them, as in Ramona tidbit in a conversation scene.There are many metaphors such as legend of Sysiphos, but striking is the scene which reveals who is the worker in Italy! Sorrentino unlike Fellini portrays hypocrisy of the Western middle class side by side that of its wealthy rulers.It shows Vatican as a sideshow to capitalism like Habemus Papam of Moretti but that side story is overly long though appropriate in the bigger theme of life, death and love.Europeans almost never take on capitalism directly like Michael Moore does and too covert is too coward, hence cynical. Including Camus. Life is too much fun for the Mediterranean Europeans to ask for freedom. So the director leaves us with ambivalent feelings, a choice of either enjoying the absurdity and emptiness of life and or asking rigorous questions on capitalism and the West.A masterpiece on artistic terms rather than the philosophical!",The Great Beauty

89,Iwould,a portrait of the artist as an old man,9,30 May 2013,"This movie's title means ""The Big Beauty"", and the story is set in Rome. Of course, the city is prominently featured, so much and so long that it makes you think that ""Rome"" could be probably credited among the actors, at least for a supporting role, as ""herself"". But buyer beware (or, to appropriately use the Latin, Caveat Emptor): this is not a film about the beauty of the immortal city. In a nutshell, I would say that this movie is about the constant research of beauty and meaning in life by an aging intellectual named Jep. I am sure I won't give away too much if I say that, eventually, he will became aware that the beauty in his life is not in Rome – heck, it's not even in the present: poor Jep has been searching for so long in the wrong place, and in the wrong time.Somebody could be annoyed by the fact that nobody in the movie seems never to do any kind of work at all -- curiously enough, the only self-proclaimed hardworking man happens to be a very seriously-looking international criminal! But for most of the other characters, money looks more like a cause, than a consequence of life. Without the restraints of needs, left with no practical excuses for not being happy, they still accomplish somehow the no small feat of spoiling their lives with various forms of suffering and pain. The story is wonderfully told both by images and dialogues. It takes some kind of ""magic realism"" turn towards the end – but that's balanced by the steadily cynic tone of the stream of consciousness coming out from Jep, wandering around the city like Marlowe in Los Angeles. Paolo Sorrentino is a writer, too: he has written a couple of enjoyable books starring a character very similar to the one depicted in the movie, a cold bastard bon vivant with a surprisingly soft heart. Mr. Toni Servillo provides flesh, and bone, and looks, and wit for this character. Just another major performance from the greatest Italian living actor: at the end of the movie it leaves into the audience the clear idea to have actually known a real person, not just a fictional one.

So we feel an unconscious suffering that correlates to our growth as a person.Most of the times, life will feel meaningless.

It tells us that even though we let the time slip away from our hands and then feel sorry and guilty about it, we will power through no matter what.As in Jep Gambardilla's words, ""Beyond there is what lies beyond.

96,MediaPanther,Deserves distinction,7,29 November 2013,"Under most circumstances, comparisons to Federico Fellini's 1960 masterpiece La Dolce Vita might seem presumptuous to some. However, the ghosts of Fellini, and particularly of his alter ego Marcello Mastroianni hover over Paolo Sorrentino's The Great Beauty (La Grande Bellezza) in a way that is thought provoking and combative. In Fellini's picture Mastroianni played Marcello Rubini as a journalist turned gossip hound, whose traipsing through the decadent night-life of Rome ultimately led to him becoming a desensitized shell of a man.Fifty-three years on, director Paolo Sorrentino suggests that not all that much has changed. Instead of rollicking to the rhythms of 60s club music, the partyers in The Great Beauty, stay up all night; day in and day out, amidst the throb of propulsive rave music. And whereas the tragic hero of La Dolce Vita was a man in his late 30s slowly losing his grip on the modern world, Sorrentino has taken this theory just one step further; for our hero is Jep Gambardella, a 65 year-old novelist whose first and only novel was a success 40 years ago, and has spent the intervening years on the party circuit. Clearly, if Mastroianni's existential angst was seen as the plight of the relatively young man in the tormented early 1960s, Sorrentino is asking us to contemplate what would happen if such a man were to dive headlong into pleasure—and not wake up for another 30 years.The comparisons to Fellini also seem apt, if only because The Great Beauty eschews any sort of traditional ""plot"" for a much more episodic, often elliptical framework. The most that can be said about a forward drive is that Jep has a terrifying awakening after an unsatisfying sexual encounter with a woman, whose self-absorption causes him to question the course of his life. The rest of the film then follows as other characters float in and out. Jep connects with the husband of his first love; falls in love with the daughter of a close friend (she is an exotic dancer); witnesses the disquieting torment of a young pre-teen artist, forced to paint in front of large crowds, even as she is denied a childhood; and meets a 104 year-old reputed saint. Not all of these episodes resolve cleanly, but all of them work toward Sorrentino's central thesis: that the increasing vapidity of Western culture is an encroaching sickness, even as you follow Jep on his search for that belief in a Great Beauty that he had as younger man.As Jep, Toni Servillo has the very tricky task of making this aimless playboy seem emotionally vulnerable. Like Mastroianni, Servillo can radiate a cool detachment that masks much deeper emotions. An example of this is in the perfectly written scene where Jep systematically repudiates everything a member of his inner circle claims: he knows that she is really a neglectful mother with an army of servants at her beck and call; her eleven novels were only published because the were subsidized by the local Communist Party; and her supposed deep love affair with her husband is a crock, as everyone knows he is in love with another man. Servillo is both callous and detached, firmly in control; he recites these facts as though he is in a formal debate. What makes this scene an absolute wonder, is that Servillo allows you to see Jep's pain. He isn't trying to be a cad, he just wishes she could see the truth: he tells her that everyone in this group is slowly being engulfed by failure, and that all they ask, is for a few laughs and a few small pleasures; no one is better than anyone else. The incredible amount of pain, sarcasm and tenderness Servillo shows you in this five minute scene, is one of the strongest performances of the year. Even as the interest level in various episodes waxes and wanes, it is Servillo's exhausted, occasionally humored visage that anchors and beckons you onward.The Great Beauty will entrance you by the quiet, understated cinematography (by Luca Bigazzi), which again strikes a callback to Fellini's work, and other 1960s auteurs. For two hours and twenty minutes, you follow a camera as it creeps behind or around figures; as it moves slowly, or sometimes if it simply stays still, demanding of us that we learn to slow down in this rapid age, and watch. Like a dream, when you wake, not everything that you've experienced will be clearly understood; but thankfully, unlike your own rich, confusing visions, you can return to this film as many times as we like. There is no doubt The Great Beauty deserves such a distinction. -Nick Kostopoulos - See more at: www.mediumraretv.org",The Great Beauty

98,veronikastehr,Search for great beauty resulted in a misanthropic view of life in decadent Rome,6,8 June 2014,"Existentialist drama with elements of comedy tells the story of a writer from the high society of Rome, who suffers from a lack of inspiration for decades, spending days of partying and getting even more cynical and full of apathy. In search for something grandiose - the great beauty - he often returns to the memory of long-past adolescent romance... The film functions through contrasts - moments of debauchery, meaningless, unnecessary philosophizing..., and then quiet moments, when the main protagonist contemplates about life, usually through intimate conversations or walks through the deserted Roman beautiful landscapes. These contrasts and the transitory nature of life are emphasized with active, engaging camera.La grande bellezza is definitely interesting artistic search for meaning and sacred moments of individual affected in glamorous and completely meaningless routine. It points out that neither the status nor the money answers any of life meaningful questions. But above interesting theme and impressive Toni Servillo, The Great Beauty does not bring intensive engagement. It tackles things through hyperbole and very pronounced misanthropic streak, without opening the possibility to feel the details and become aware of the fact that beneath the surface of blather and futility - there are tiny sparks of great beauty and human misery. It must be noted that the film was affected by plague known as - selective nudity. Many artistic films are often referred to freedom of the human body, but in fact they only routinely emphasize already enthroned gender bias.",The Great Beauty

I watch it the first time in the cinema and felt I was riding a rocket. I knew I saw a great film but I was not able to comprehend it in such small amount of time.This film requires some great patient to watch. It perhaps also requires some extensive experience in life to have great sympathy to these characters (specifically a life experience from a dirty poor low class to a filthy rich high class). I imagine a great number of general public would not appreciate such movie - but to my surprised, a great deal of people do. Perhaps a great movie can truly transform how the viewers see the world.Each scene in the movie has relationships with every other scene in the movie. Anton Chekhov says, ""If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there.""

Generally this is the sign of an over-rated European art-house film, but somehow Paulo Sorrentino manages to pull it off, and I was very glad I kept watching until the end. The Great Beauty is beautiful, touching, sometimes funny and often absurd. The cinematography is delicious, the characters are finely drawn, the music is lovely and the acting is excellent. And it's set in Rome. That, I suspect, is the main appeal of the film; if it had been set in, say, Wolverhampton, I might well have given up on it, which would have been a shame.",The Great Beauty
106,agitpapa-562-1441,Poetry and art,10,16 December 2013,"A lot of people have compared this film to Fellini. Fellini's films are three-ring circuses with a constant procession of freaks whose burlesque often serves to distract us from the director's rough-hewn style, the bad lighting, the cheesy décors, and the thin dialog. Fellini was at his best shooting circus people in available light in La Strada.Sorrentino is the anti-Fellini. He has cast a midget in his film not so much as a tribute than as an indictment of Fellini. His midget isn't a Fellinian freak but a complex, interesting woman who has to constantly remind us of her size because we fail to notice it, absorbed by her intense face.Sorrentino's film is crafted to perfection, totally devoid of cheap gimmicks, a visual, musical, and literary feast in every scene, right down to the rabbit stew the cardinal so passionately describes. It's a last, lingering gaze at the beauty and art in the world that is being inexorably submerged by schlock and superficiality.The protagonist, a writer who has nothing left to say - or rather who would like to write about nothing if he could figure out how - can only wryly observe what is happening, powerless even to stop himself from participating in the desecration, as when he acts out his cynical funereal etiquette to the letter.",The Great Beauty

108,dylansgabriel,"One for the cinematography, one for the score",2,18 May 2014,"The film begins in Rome at the splashy, bacchanal 65th birthday party of the dapper Jep Gambardella. Calling the event extravagant would be an understatement.Gambardella is a celebrity socialite. He spends most of his afternoons laying around in a hammock, drinking, staring at the coliseum from his terrace. Killing time until the party-wild evenings. Jep lives a comfortable, carefree, decadent life.Sometimes he thinks about a coastal summer romance from his youth - shown with Jep laying in bed and watching blue waves move across the ceiling, and also in brief flashbacks.Forty years ago ago Jep wrote an acclaimed novel, inspired by that intense romance. He has not written a novel since, and now works as a high society journalist. In one scene Jep reviews a performance art show where the artist sprints and head-butts a stone wall.he glitterati Jep surrounds himself with are the kind of people who wait in line with each other to get Botox injections, as nonchalant as if they're waiting to buy movie tickets. As one woman tells the man injecting her, ""Just got back from India. I had amazing dysentery. Come to my divorce party, I'll have burlesque dancers there."" When Jep and his friends get together they talk about subjects such as Marxism, collectivism, misanthropy, and defeatism.Jep refuses to acknowledge any disagreeable aspect of life. At one of his regular dinner parties a friend tries to tell him about her son, who is experiencing mental health issues. Jep immediately dismisses the subject by recommending a psychiatrist, and then starts to talk about the salad.In one scene Jep shops with his girlfriend for a funeral dress. They are in a patronizing store where the entire selection of dresses, displayed on the walls, can be counted off on your fingers. During this scene Jep explains the rules for how one must conduct themselves at a funeral, which he sees as a social event. The behaviours he describes equate to calculated self promotion.After Jep's former lover (the one from his youth) passes away, he learns that he was the only person she ever loved. The person who tells Jep this is the woman's husband of thirty five years. He discovered this when going through his wife's journal. The news shocks Jep. Perhaps in spite of this, he considers writing again. He gets into a relationship with a woman. He cries at a funeral (something he previously said to never do.)So with these changes in Jep's life the director is basically trying to show that Jep is becoming more disillusioned with his frivolous lifestyle? That at the end of the film he is a more rounded person? That instead of numbing himself at endless decadent parties, Jep is forced to confront deeper aspects of life: hurt, love, death? Well, Jep was a despicable person at the start of the film. And in the end he is the same; a narcissistic, flippant man. His friends are shallow, materialistic, and conceited.At one of his parties Jep tells the person he sits beside that the dance trains at their parties are the best in Rome. The next shot is of Jep drunkenly leading one of the trains. And then Jep is sitting next to his housekeeper, disillusioned, lamenting about how his life is nothing. Well how noble and sincere, you sanctimonious piece of crap. The film is gorgeously shot, and the music is sublime. The opening scene contains choral music so transcendent it is unearthly. And then we're blasted into an aural storm of ecstatic club beats. And there is also the devastating pastorale composition, combining the music of Arvo Pärt with a choir rendition of Robert Burn's beautiful poem My Heart's in the Highlands, which mourns the narrator's lost youth in the Highlands. ""The Great Beauty"" is insipid, meandering, and unnecessarily long. The title is appropriate to the material, as ""The Great Beauty"" is totally self-righteous. At the heart of this movie (or where a heart should be) is a group of terrible human beings.screenplayisles.blogspot",The Great Beauty

Jep Gambardelli is a great character, from whose mouth comes some of the most scathing and insightful dialogue written in years. It could easily have been played by the greats of the new wave: Mastroianni or Belmondo or Giannini in their heyday. I kept thinking it was a brilliant homage to the legacy of Fellini, but less bizarre and more though provoking. Visually lush, musically captivating, and the story leaves you thinking about it for days after. Truly a carnival cast brings it off in great style, that's nothing other than Roman at heart. I was singing out loud the catchy dance anthem by Bob Sinclar song remix with the famous Italian pop singer Raffaella Carra for days afterwards. Nuns, midgets, giraffes, flamingos, and some of the best bacchanalian parties ever filmed.

It doesn't have a strong storyline, but it managed to keep my attention the whole two and a half hours with a perfect cinematography, a great soundtrack which expresses the emotional state of the protagonist and a great cast. There is also a good amount of irony and humor in the movie which makes it even better to watch.

The plot is secondary. It was a delight to watch. I might admit a bias: I am an Italophile. And this film has all things Italian: style, of course, but more than that it's the attitude that no matter how they look, they're confident in themselves. There were lots of ironic moments in the film as well: almost as if it were the Italians mocking themselves. Film centers around a main character, and Toni Sevillo is perfect. His character is memorable: he stands out like a character in a great novel. All the other actors, almost stock characters are perfect too.

The main character, Jeb, at age 65, is only beginning to sense the empty existential nature of not only his existence, but also of that of those around him. The only meaning and true beauty which Jeb fines is in the art of centuries past and the almost Christ-like dedication of living saints, akin to Mother Theresa of today. Church cardinals are seen to be beneath concept, and naught but foolish pontificators.It is a movie not only to be seen, but emphatically felt as the emptiness of 40 years of Jeb's shallow hedonism is laid bare. But, having seen briefly seen the promised land, Jeb does not venture forth, but embraces the emptiness of high society, perhaps to forget the wonder of young love that he once saw and felt, but all too briefly.The cinematography is exceptional, with each shot a painting of life in the moment. At 2 hours, 12 minutes of story time, the film is a bit too long and the very end becomes a bit of a bore.

He does interviews for newspapers and his editor is the only sympathetic character in the novel. The rest rely on drugs, sex, clothes, parties to give them satisfaction. This could make a good film but Jeb just wanders around getting sadder and sadder. Friends leave Rome, die, suffer despair.

This was because no matter how old you are, we should always try and better ourselves and seek what actually REALLY TRULY makes us happy.

It's basically a story about a middle aged writer Jep with one successful novel who becomes a more compassionate man instead of a party boy, as well as the lives lead by the well-to-do in Rome. Many questions and inadequacies are found in this film. Jep seems to have done nothing much in his life after publishing his one successful novel besides his magazine job and partying, and one wonders how his magazine job sustains his lifestyle. His middle aged poorer theatre friend is not very perceptive despite his age as he thinks his relationship with an arrogant model can last. The socialite scene is filled with snobbishness, superficiality and hidden family issues. We see the usual disapproval against the Vatican authorities who enjoy socializing more than finding enlightenment but it's quite well-known already that the Vatican is corrupt and satanic, doing much evil that this film doesn't touch upon. Italy seems to rely solely on its past glories but I'm not sure if that's an accurate depiction. Jep's companionship with non-socialites is touching.

125,janjira-31277,Forget La Dolce Vita,9,4 September 2017,"Sorrentino's La Grande Bellezza is often compared with Fellini's La Dolce Vita. This is easy enough to see, both films being set in the Eternal City and peopled with an assortment of odd and/or striking characters; yet, the comparison to Fellini applies to the first 30 minutes only, during the first of three parties. After, in the early morning light, the mood changes as we begin to learn about the previous night's Birthday Boy who has turned sixty-five. From this point, unhurriedly, the film diverges from Fellini. Why, because Sorrentino's subject is different. In a way, Le Grande Bellezza becomes a polemic that makes use of satire, irony, gut feelings, touches of magic realism, and one rather good inside joke (not a spoiler: the 'aging' 42-year old stripper – an object of parental concern - was played by someone ten years older; but, for the punchline, you must see the movie.) La Grande Bellezza is about memory, loss, self-assessment, regret, and renewal; the flashes of beauty too often missed; everything that is buried beneath quotidian existence and ""the incessant blah, blah, blah"" (end quote).

While the cinematography was entertaining, the movie was a little redundant and pretentious for me. Still it's worth a view. The film has been compared to Fellini, but to me Fellini in general has more movement in his pictures. More black comedy that hits deeper. More soul. In La Grande Bellezza, the camera moves, but not so much the people. They just sit there talking. I suspect that may be what Sorrentino was trying to show, satire, or criticize? but Rome today has many sides and this is not the most interesting one. I think if anyone belongs to this slice of Rome it is the filmmakers of La Grande Bellezza. Discussing the past and trying to emulate it, instead of moving towards the future and embracing it. Still despite it's pretentiousness, the film makes the viewer think deeply. The film is brave for being existential with very high technical skill. Some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. There are some very strong moments where greatness is shown. These moments are rare for movies nowadays. My problem with the film is in-between these flashes of greatness, the story drags and is a boring conversation on an even more boring subject. To me the subject comes across as self-righteous and uninspiring. That really made me emotional because the performances and visuals were the opposite. I suspect this could be the motive behind the film. Either way the director is a very smart man, but I prefer directors that are able to entertain while giving their message.I really enjoyed Sabrina Ferilli and Carlo Verdone in this film, but not so much the lead actor. I preferred him in Gommora and didn't like Il Divo at all. I do see this film as an achievement in art, but for me it wasn't entertaining outside of its visuals and nods to the past Italian masters. I would prefer to rewatch Fellini, Pasolini, Antonioni, Dino Risi, Bellochio, Leone, Martino, Argento, and suggest others do, while waiting for the a new Italian master to emerge. To me La Grande Bellezza ironically belongs in the same company that it criticizes. It is a very strange thing that I notice of Italian culture in which I have been lucky enough to be both on the outside and inside of as someone whose family has lived in and around Rome since before WWII and still does.Don't forget and allow yourself to be fooled by another side of local genius. A different art. The nationalist hype machine under the shadows of Berlusconi is as strong as ever in Italy.

It's about a man who is older now who looks back at his life and more than that he is looking at the entire scene he lives in and did live in when he was younger. I expected more and deeper meaning in this movie than what was there.It's pretty predictable story wise and on an emotional level. I'm shocked to see this was Italy's entry into the Academy Awards.Not to say it's not a good movie because it is worth seeing but don't expect too much from it, it is good but in no way compares to great Italian films.",The Great Beauty
129,serriricky,A portrait of a decadence artist,8,12 April 2021,"The Great Beauty is a film that talks about the meaning of art according to its author, through the story of a writer's life. The protagonist, Jep Gambardella, is a journalist who writes articles regarding modern art. We learn that, at a young age, he wrote a book entitled ""The human apparatus"" which was able to mark the history of Italian literature. He is unable to do this and then decides to seek inspiration by surrounding himself with artists and writers, living in the most worldly part of Rome. Although many of his friends encourage him to return to writing novels, he will never do so, despite his constant search for inspiration. Through memories we learn that the only reason why Jep wrote this novel is because he fell in love with this beautiful girl after a night spent with her next to a lighthouse.Sorrentino's mastery in representing the life and path of this wonderful character are truly superb. The film strikes the viewer continuously through beautiful scenery and colors that are beneficial to the eye. Beautiful technical and audio sector, capable of immersing the viewer in the scenarios represented in the film. The interpretation of Toni Servillo confirms him as one of the best Italian actors currently in circulation, a performance that could also have earned him a nomination for best actor. The only negative note of this film is the duration, which is too long compared to the message sent, which could have been more impactful if the minutes had been less.",The Great Beauty
130,arterybg,Amazing film (Spoilers Ahead),10,12 April 2014,"""The Great Beauty"" is a film about a male writer who has just turned 65 years. He is swallowed by the glamour and consumerism of the Rome's high life - a dream he once had and actually managed to accomplish with the great success of his one and only published book, back when he was 26. The main character has become ""the king"" of the Rome's high life and he spends his current nights mainly drinking and partying with friends. But underneath his ritzy lifestyle we see an emptiness. He is moved by the innocence and the silent moments of essence/truth which are happening around him(in the city and with his friends). The main character goes through a massive evolution and realizes that his life is empty, lacks purpose and that he is unhappy and has not achieved his dreams and has not acted upon his inner urges/impulses. Everything begins with the visit of a stranger(the husband of a girl who had loved the writer and they were lovers for a while many years ago). It is clear by the end of the film that the main character had really loved and maybe still loves this girl. Maybe this was the one true moment in his whole life.",The Great Beauty
131,davbourn-1,The Second Novel of Jep Gambardella,9,25 March 2018,"Even positive reviews of Sorrentino's masterpiece cavill at the lack of an ongoing story amidst the vignettes of 21st century dolce vita. In fact, the storyline is there for those with eyes to see it. It makes its first appearance as Jep stares at his bedroom ceiling which morphs into a blue sea. Unexpectedly, the husband of Jep's first (and only) love arrives to tell him she has died and in her diary she named Jep as her one true love. The image of the blue sea is explained as we see a flashback to Jep (in his early 20s) diving under an oncoming speed boat, watched by girls including the one he falls in love with. Later, in another flashback, Jep recalls their moonlit tryst. It was their love that inspired Jep's first highly acclaimed novel. Since then, he has suppressed the great beauty of their innocent love. But events have conspired to force him to remember and then, and only then, is he ready to begin his second novel. With dry pseudo-cynicism, he says ""It's just a trick"". We know better.",The Great Beauty

The cast is without exception proper, in particular Toni Servillo, lending wit, elegance, wisdom, imagination, and tactfulness to the stories' protagonist Jep Gambardella. Although the film is not a particularly short one, director Paolo Sorrentino accomplished to leave out all the unnecessary things with which most directors would have subtracted some quality from the film's storyline. That, in my opinion, is the movie's biggest asset. As brilliant as the movie's storytelling, cast, and setting is, the soundtrack of La Grande Bellezza needs to be mentioned as well. Melancholic English pop songs and Italian chants and classical pieces create a sound melting into the pictures and dialogues and creating a huge intensity and fascination.After all, La Grande Bellezza is a movie one must watch rather than read about for its great strength is in the emotions and the joy it evokes rather than in intellectual and philosophical insights - which it nonetheless offers as well.",The Great Beauty

However, while the other is depicting the character of a living man, on the contrary this one is a story, a magnificent invention which describes a lesser known side of Italy beyond its stereotypes.The music, the scenography, the photography and the sites, all superbly chosen. Paolo Sorrentino proves that Italian cinema, despite a great pause, can come back again at its level best and this masterpiece in my belief deserves the recognition that critics in the past have reserved to great maestros such as Federico Fellini.",The Great Beauty

Watching the movie I thought about Marcello Mastroianni, it could have been the perfect actor for this film if this was his movies era. But do not misunderstand me, Toni Servillo is in my opinion the best actor for this movie. Locations are decadent and superb. What I liked so much about this movie is also the rhythm, the pauses and all the surrounding characters that give sense to the whole decadent plot. When the movie ended, I and other people stood up and watched the screen silently. This is a movie that lasts in your mind for a long time.

It looks like many elements are inserted there only for the reason of appearing beautiful under a certain light and with a certain music on the background and that's it. I would like to mention here the Chekhov's gun principle that goes more or less like : ""If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there."" . To me this movie has a lot of pistols hanging on walls and very few of them are fired.",The Great Beauty

The same disillusionment with high life rides high throughout the movie, the pervasive sense of existence of a spiritual entity out there and the fundamental resemblance of the protagonist of both films makes it hard to not remember La Dolce Vita every step of the way. This movie unfortunately fails to be memorable like its predecessor despite the vivid imagery, exquisite cinematography, excellent score and fantastic acting from almost all the cast and especially Toni Servillo as Jep Gambardella, the smooth talking philosopher cum journalist. Among all of these successes the story gets lost and that is the great tragedy for this film. It will be unfair to not mention the intelligent writing the movie has utilized. There is a lack of using modern technological devices and despite a lot of nudity, there are no actual sex scenes which all symbolise the isolation and lack of intimacy in the life of our protagonist. The smaller characters have been given ample character which all point to very proficient writing once again. (I am so upset that this movie did not work on the whole!) While Anita Eckberg and Marcello Mastroianni's three minutes in the fountain will forever remain with me,this movie will regrettably not get a recommendation from this reviewer.",The Great Beauty
140,nikitar,A new take on an old story,9,13 October 2013,"The Great Beauty is such an unusual concoction of sights and sounds, it's a wonder it works at all. Watching it is like seeing a walking bicycle and realizing, to your amazement, that one can actually ride it.The movie follows Jep Gambardella, the king of Rome's night life. Jep came to Rome in his twenties, after having written a very promising novel, but 40 years later he is settled as a journalist for a high-class literary magazine. Jep has friends, who are just as frustrated and unsatisfied with their lives as he is, despite having all their red Ferraris and high-rise condos. Together they keep each other company and form a support group of sorts. The presence of other miserable people convinces them it's OK, the life is still worth living and facade is still worth maintaining.Jep has invested last four decades into becoming the Rome's chief socialite and now he has the power to make party a success or disaster. But there's something compulsive about his pursuit of entertainment and admiration. Like a functioning alcoholic, Jep doesn't enjoy his life, but has no will to change it either. He reminds me of Michael Fassbender's sex-addict character in Shame. At the time of orgasm, Fassbender's expression was not that of pleasure, but of pain.Soon after his 65th birthday, Jep notes to himself that he no longer can afford doing things he doesn't want to do. Instead, he looks up his old friends, learns more about his now-dead girlfriend who left him 40 years ago and develops a friendship with 41 year old stripper named Ramona. Ramona doesn't try to appear important or intellectual, she seems to exist entirely in the present moment. (That presence of mind has its own price, as we learn later)One of the appealing things about Great Beauty is that its characters are not aware of how funny they are. The pinnacle of comical absurdity is a 104 year old Catholic 'saint'. She's not official saint yet, we're told, but everyone calls her Santa (Saint) Maria. She looks like a mummy that just walked out of its glass case in British Museum, communicates with animals and at one point parodies the 'stair crawl' from the Exorcist. And yet, at no point the film is making fun of her. Nobody seems to question their sanity when Santa Maria asks a flock of migrating flamingos to rest on Jep's balcony.Sometimes I think the Great Beauty is making it intentionally difficult for us to get to the story. The opening scene with Jep's euro-trash birthday party lasts several minutes longer than storytelling rules require. The changes between scenes are often abrupt and even stunning, leaving the viewer to fill the gaps. There's no obvious drama or big emotional payoff, as you'd expect from an American movie. And yet, at its core, it's the same old story about a writer who has lost his inspiration and tries to figure his place in the world. I feel sympathy for him and his journey, just like I would in any other film.",The Great Beauty

142,thedozinglion,Like Swimming in Honey,10,7 September 2013,"This film is a modern masterpiece of Cinema. Luca Bigazzi's cinematography is beautiful, with elegant tracking shots of Rome that draw the viewer into the loveliness of Jep's world (even if age and experience seems to have robbed him of the ability to feel and see this great beauty himself). The enchanting score of choral works by David Lang (I Lie), Vladimir Martynov (The Beatitudes), John Tavener (The Lamb) and Arvo Part (My Heart is in the Highlands) give depth to the wonderful images of Rome. This haunting soundtrack replaces the need for dialogue and adds intensity to Servillo's melancholic performance.Servillo's acting is superb from his moments of dry humour to the heartbreaking intensity of those feelings he cannot quite hold on to. La Grande Bellezza gives a window into Roman life that is probably only fully understood by a fellow Roman. However all can appreciate the aesthetic pleasure of Sorrentino's Rome and the bittersweet meanderings of its characters. This is a cinema of the highest order, imbued with elegance & style. For the viewer it is like swimming in honey. Grazie Signore Sorrentino.",The Great Beauty

It struck me that Sorrentino and Luca Bigazzi where able to pull out beautiful shots out of a dying city like Rome. I not only see a homage to Fellini and a nod at Alain Resnois 'Last Year at Marienbad', but I see a director who is committed in showing through his movies the society that he lives in. Although it is set in modern Rome, 'La Grande Belleza"" is timeless because it mixes the post modern ways with the always existing human misery and disgrace. I invite you to sit down, pour yourself a good Italian wine and get ready for a trip through a magnificent display of color, art, sculptures, sex, drugs, religion, surrealism and lots of parties.",The Great Beauty

He is suffering an everlasting writer's block and feels that any attempt to write a new book would be worthless. His friends are mostly old wealthy fellows, hiding their boredom and uneasiness behind falsehood, pretended happiness and talents they don't possess. La dolce vita is now a masquerade of old friends having fun, yet unable to find a meaning to their lives. A break-through happens when the young son of the writer's friend suddenly dies and an old missionary nun goes to visit the Vatican. La Grande Bellezza (The Great Beauty) is a slow paced movie, at times boring, yet full of colors, camera movements, wittiness and art, featuring an impressive photography and soundtrack and, generally speaking, good acting performances. Its major flaw, in my opinion, is the lack of a central story, but a collection of many tailored around the main character. This can be confusing at times for a movie that runs for two hours and fifteen minutes. However, it represents well a carousel, a merry-go-round of lives wasted in the beauty of the past, the pointless vacuity of the present, and the hope for the future.",The Great Beauty

His satiric smile will never be forgotten. 2) Reminds a lot about Fellini - his creative power of matching different / unrelated facts or locations without reducing the story to something stupid! 3) Roma-Rome... Without using panoramic repetitions taken from the city how could a director express the beauty of a city. And it was done!

This looked too much as a commercial for plastic surgeons, drug dealers and local tourism. The overacting and the storyline: Well, it's like Sep said about the ""trains in the Roman parties"". The first hour, I thought: ""It's introduction, so I'll understand where they're going"", but at the end I still was waiting to see all snippets of information to come together.

149,cristiana_plavicheanu,A Kaleidoscope of reflections,10,9 March 2014,"La Grande Bellezza - the Great Beauty - enchanted me by leaving the Hollywood type of development behind. I would call it a masterpiece of earthly proportions, earthly because the characters, the story-line and the deep introspection of the main character keep the film here, alongside the tourists and the people of Rome, down to earth but in such a way that it becomes perfection and becomes complete with a touch of fantasy. It is a strong and accurate depiction of a careless and apparently joyous life, not at all short of drama and ecstasy, garnished with lavish settings and dream-like moments. Life. The performance of Mr.Servillo is heart warming and intimidating at the same time. Jep's innocent gaze carries the story along and puts his character in an ever-moving glass-bubble, from where everything can be perceived but somehow doesn't alter. The amazing amount of melancholia topped with a just-right touch of cynicism Mr. Servillo brings to Jep Gambardella keeps one wondering how much unlike we all really are. An island of wealth, sensitivity and intelligence stranded in a sea of luxurious settings and spoiled lives, he keeps moving on, circling ever closer to his own ""recherche du temps perdu"".Warning - this is a movie that will urge you to meditate and probably raise some delicate questions in your own minds, if you let the Great Beauty drag you into its Rome of wealth and extravagant solitude.",The Great Beauty

156,iluque00,"Travel is useful, it exercises the imagination.",8,23 March 2014,"""The Great Beauty"" begins with an epigraph by Louis-Ferdinand Céline: ""Travel is useful, it exercises the imagination. All the rest is disappointment and fatigue. Our journey is entirely imaginary. That is its strength."" From the soothing sublimity of ""I Lie"", sung in Yiddish, to the pagan screech of an exuberant fête, ""The Great Beauty"" opens wide to take in the whole of existence in a single breath. That breath is Roma.Polarities, excesses, and asceticism are the elements of a film that sets out on an ambitious path in search of human greatness, whatever that is (I suppose we only know once we get there). Jep Gambardella, played by Tony Servillo, turns to us for the first time during his birthday party with a charming smile; no one would ever know he longs for something else. At a certain moment during the party the music is chopped and screwed and we hear only Jep. We come to the core of his soul. To the question that determined his life. What did he want most in life? When he was young, his friends answered pussy, but Jep answered the smell of old people's homes. La Grand Bellezza looks closely at the sublime path, the invisible life of effort.A performance artist head-butts a stone bridge at full speed. Unlike the audience that is moved by a reverential sense of curiosity, Jep is stoic. He knows the great commitment that leads a person to the ultimate sacrifice, of which the performance is only an example of, but it's a performance and Jep is a connoisseur of this spiritual hinterland, so he's skeptical of this artist's motive in having an audience. Later in the film, when Jep tries to interview Sister Maria—a well-known holy woman--the nun says that she cannot give him an interview because she has taken a vow of poverty. She goes on to say that poverty cannot be talked about, instead it must be lived.Sister Maria climbing to the top of a staircase and a young beautiful woman in an island, are they comparable? For Jep they are. This juxtaposition seems to ask what is more important, the ends or the means. Another way of putting it is what is more important, the journey or the destination? Jep stopped writing because he was looking for the great beauty and couldn't find it. What he discovers is that not finding the great beauty is finding it. And there is something even more absurd: it's all a trick. Blah, blah, blah says Jep. A work of the imagination says Céline.",The Great Beauty
157,lukerohling,"I hate to say it, but just watch La Dolce Vita",5,20 November 2019,"I know it seems lazy to judge a film by directly comparing it to it's clear inspiration, but come on. It's almost as if this film's only purpose is to explain the themes of La Dolce Vita in a way where modern audiences don't have to think as hard about the themes.And therein lies my main critique of La Grande Bellezza: it's preachy beyond belief. We're often given grandiose voiceovers illustrating an aging man's life regrets, or prolonged monologues from the same man describing the sad current state of our modern day society. Yes, he's a writer, but this is a movie.The best thing I can say about this movie is that the wonderful score and soundtrack are sweeping and delightful. However, their sheer scale and epic quality only exaggerate the aforementioned preachy nature of the entire film. We get it, the film is saying something important now.Due to its nature, the script does contain several beautiful thoughts and quotes to remember, but they'd perhaps be better appreciated in an actual memoir or simply a novel. And while the main character is supposed to come off as charming, it's hard not to view him as a condescending patriarch trying to cope with the end of his social reign. Okay... that might be a tad harsh but I occasionally felt that way nonetheless.Perhaps the film itself symbolizes Italy's attempts to recapture the mysticism and romance of Fellini's Rome; a parody of itself as it fails to recognize the evolving society around it that prevents such a reality from existing some 70 years after its prime.

The mere watching and listening to the sheer beauty of the succession of images and conversations will bring an emotional dreamer like me to tears because of sweet, almost physical ache. The thing is that the plot doesn't matter that much, it is not the main focus. One just drowns in your own thoughts and emotions the film creates.

Of course, it is only my IMHO, maybe I am too realistic and my interests goes further than regrets of dying ""bohema"" people. I would not recommend this film to my friends.",The Great Beauty
164,BadgersNMoles,An Updated Version of a Timeless Classic,9,12 September 2013,"To say that La Grande Bellezza overflows with references to La Dolce Vita, the beacon which still sheds its nostalgic light upon Rome's nightlife and myth, is an understatement. In this regard, originality is certainly not a quality that one is likely to find in that film. Similarly to its model, La Grande Bellezza's main character is a middle-aged man who has renounced his literary ambitions so as to revel in Rome's superficial jet set; this allows him to hold a privileged position as both witness and accomplice to the ""eternal city""'s contradictions. Likewise, Jep Gambardella is both detached and passionate, cynical and elegiac about his city and its inhabitants - much like, apparently, the film's director. The film basically consists of a series of apparently disconnected episodes in Jep's roaming around the Italian capital. These episodes are suffused with a breathtaking sense of beauty and awe (yes, you will fall in love with Rome when you see this!), yet these scenes are systematically mitigated contrapuntally by grotesque interludes, satirical of Rome's religious, artistic or social elite, much as in Fellini's film. In short, for me Sorrentino's film is the dream offspring, updated and highly stylized, of the giant it never ceases to pay homage to.",The Great Beauty
165,onnoquinten,I don't know,7,19 November 2021,"How Jep is SO obscenely rich... every other decor looks like a million dollars. Apparently he wrote a very very popular, yet deeply artistic and intellectual book ( how one gets so rich in that genre idk). He wrote when he was in love, now his soul dull and tired from the stimuli of high society life. Very pretentious and arrogant people, like Jep himself, but he seems to notice it and is in fact ashamed, or still arrogant? Will he find a deeper meaning? Should a 'normal person' care?",The Great Beauty
166,villarru,Entertaining to a a point and then it wears you down,4,2 December 2013,"I found the movie very entertaining with all the choreographic scenes of the high life-the mishmash of music and dancing, even some mariachis in the mix. The surreal scenes were good as well. But I found the movie extremely long for what it wanted portray as the crux of the film. After a while, the main character's introspection became another exercise in futility since it lacked that watershed moment you were expecting. Instead, it would take you to more of the same thing--more dancing, drinking, strip teasing, the works. So it was an endless ordeal of personal vignettes and reality checks, against the background of the senselessness of the high life. It failed to engage us after two hours, so we left, we had a drink, and called it a night.",The Great Beauty
167,marcot64,"Interesting, yet not not indulgent",8,24 February 2015,"Not being into ""artsy"" films, I did not really know anything about this movie, but it came on and decided to sit through it. At first the dialogue impressed me, the conversations were well timed, witty and brutally truthful.Acting was mixed. Some of the cast were scripted merely to add some big names to the list, with no valuable contributions. The writing and direction were the strengths. I read several negative reviews here, and at first I wanted to blame the immaturity of the reviewer, then realized that is not true. What these reviewers lack is mortality. When people get to a certain age of having to face their lost youth, their impending death and of those close to them, their perspectives change. A youthful reference would be 'The Blade Runner', at the end, when Rutger Hauer's character realizes he will soon die and starts to yearn for life to the point of saving the life of his enemy (Ford). The beauty of Rome is camouflaged in a way only someone who is familiar with the city can appreciate. It was a bit too long, but in my opinion because it was edited for Italian audiences, who can relate to many of the random scenes. It makes you think.",The Great Beauty
168,wabes,Party emptiness and deep regrets in a wealthy and ever gorgeous Rome!,8,4 June 2013,"For this movie, Italian director Sorrentino chose as a male-star his icon Toni Servillo and introduced Giusi Merli, a well-known Italian theatrical Shakespearean comedian, playing here ""la Santa"": beautiful storytelling, musics and environments, all very good actors also from theater each one perfectly ""fitting into the role"", above all Giovanna Vignola in the role of a magazine director dwarf, Sabrina Ferilli and Serena Grandi. Italian film-makers Fellini, Germi and Lizzani come afloat during this motion picture in which the author often shares with his contemporary Moretti the opera's solemnity of many scenes. Think back to ""La Dolce Vita"", ""Roma Bene"", ""The Birds, the Bees and the Italians"", ""The Caiman"", ""The son's Room"", ""We have a Pope"", ""Il Divo"", ""This must be the Place"". But what WOULD Woody Allen think about it? However Sorrentino, just over forty, with few very different films in his luggage, confirms here, snubbed by Italian critics working for Rightwing, his directorial seal and a certain self-ironic poetry.",The Great Beauty

It oozed love, beauty and life !! I haven't seen any other Paolo Sorrentino's movies; but his style has definitely intrigued me to check out his other feature films. He seemed to have influenced from new wave in French Cinema. My eyes are immune or rather untrained to see any nuances or creative cinematography techniques. So only criteria which I can dissect is theme, story, characters where The Great Beauty excels and viewers are presented with such mesmerizing experience !",The Great Beauty
170,bbentonb,Fascinating style of movie making with a buried depth,9,16 November 2014,"I almost stopped watching. I thought there was no story. If it were not for the amazing photography and music, I might have. Slowly, the pathos of Jep grew on me. The dark humor around many of the characters made me slow down enough to know I was watching something new.Jep's honesty about himself, and his emptiness, was like a walk down one of the beautiful streets in the movie. It carried the movie. There was never any hope for real transformation, but his crying after warning against it in his soliloquy on how to behave at funerals gives a sense that he was getting unstuck from his cynicism and beginning to feel his grief.I rarely watch a movie twice in a short period, but I wanted to share this one with a friend and found I liked it more the second time than the first. That is as much high praise as i can recall offering a film in years.",The Great Beauty
171,dollywolls8,"Pretentious, self-indulgent claptrap",1,26 January 2014,"Saw this movie yesterday. The only things I liked about it were the cinematography and some beautiful scenes of Rome. As for the rest of the film, well, it just didn't hit the spot. To me, it was one wild, noisy, boring party after another interspersed with not very interesting (and sometimes self-indulgent and pretentious) conversations taking place in various settings. A lot of uninteresting, creepy or awful characters (using that word very loosely). There were a few scenes whose purpose, if any, were a complete mystery to me and will remain so. I have no idea what the movie was supposed to be about. I was so glad when it was over. Great to see the sun again.",The Great Beauty
172,hhamber,Greatly Over-Hyped,3,30 November 2013,"Had great expectations about this movie, having seen the previews and the high ratings. The opening scenes are indeed stunning, a view from the Gianicolo, some of the most beautiful fountains in Rome, a wild party on a rooftop in central Rome, a lavish apartment overlooking the Colosseo. Then the questions started to come up, what is the point of this act, why does the main protagonist have to speak with that heavy annoying (at times incomprehensible) slurred neapolitan accent, could they have found an actor that is even less charismatic, who cares when he endlessly looks into a garden, why did she have to hit her head intentionally into that roman aqueduct, pointless dialog etc. Sadly, after about 40mins or so we had enough of the movie. My wife and I just could not overcome the utter boredom, the unduly contorted dialog and the often over-emphatic poor acting, and ... we had to leave. And yes, we are both Italians living in the US. A portrait of contemporary Italy ? Best European film of 2013 ?? Give me a break. I wonder where the comparison with Fellini came from, he was a true artist, one of the greatest, and this instead seems in the end a poorly staged unimaginative imitation, at best. A suggestion: go see a movie by Giuseppe Tornatore to see what truly great Italian filmmaking can be like.",The Great Beauty
173,midknight-930-47748,An uneven but effective portrait of contemporary Italy,7,17 November 2013,"The protagonists of the movies by Sorrentino are often people who consider themselves morally and intellectually superior to the environment where they live. People like Jep Gambardella, the main character of ""The Great Beauty"": he wrote in his youth an awarded novel, now forgotten and out-of-print, and then he just contented himself to become a snob socialite who spends his nights attending wild parties, and the days contemplating the beautiful ruins of Rome smoldering all around him. He appears vaguely disgusted not only by most of the people he mixes with, but also by himself. The film progresses at an uneven pace that reminds the camera-movements of Sorrentino, at times elegant and enlightening, at other times pointless and vaguely irritating. The most accomplished and amusing scenes are those that reveal the great joke that artistic creation has become nowadays: Jep is good at revealing the limited talent of the artists that he interviews, maybe he feels that they aren't so different from him, just playing a bluff or a single winning hand as he did so long ago with his only published novel. There are several epiphany moments in the film, poetic pearls borrowed directly from Fellini, and the old magic of films like ""La dolce vita"" and ""Roma"" strengthens the film and makes it shine more in their reflected light than with its own light. Despite some pretentiousness ""The Great Beauty"" is an effective portrait of contemporary Italy that uses Roma as its paradigm, a city trapped by sloth, unable to find its way towards any future that could compare to its glorious past, and content to get lost dancing and partying as the ruins of Beauty crumble all around. A final suggestion for those who compare Sorrentino with Fellini is to watch ""Roma"", one of Fellini's less known films, and compare it to ""The Great Beauty"". The talented but overrated Paolo Sorrentino hasn't yet legs long enough to walk in the path left by Federico Fellini.",The Great Beauty

For the last six months or so this is the film that has been on my mind. I cannot really think of another film that had the same effect on me. The soundtrack is amazing, the party scenes are exhilarating and the dialog is fantastic. The fact that it is all in the beautiful Italian language of course helps. But what really makes this movie great are the small things, the details: the cardinal who can't stop talking about how to stew a good rabbit, the girls silently dancing behind the glass at the party, the strange mafia boss living next to Jep.

But I don't think this film has the depth of Fellini and it doesn't have the Nino Rota score. Yes, it is luscious and has several fat woman in large hats and a dwarf but the similarity with Fellini ends there. Fellini's films had a logical thread which this lacks. The cinematography is wonderful and the sets are an enticing invitation to visit Rome. I want to stay in that apartment with a view of the Colosseum from its top deck! The cameo of Fanny Ardant as she passed Jep and said ""Bon nuit"" was a real treat. I loved the turn with the priest and the Catholic church. The best part was the send up of Mother Theresa at the end. Hilarious! The film's success lies in its answer to ""What is the meaning of life?"" - a joke.",The Great Beauty

At first, I thought about how empty and frivolous it could be! I didn't understand that the point of the movie was just that! Realize the emptiness and loneliness that we can find in the world. Realize how we easily lie to ourselves. It showed me how even if we are surrounded by the most beautiful things, we have always fear of loneliness; we have fear of true feelings; we have fear of death. So we build appearances and masks because we like to feel ""we have the control"" of our lives, we like to feel that we don't need to share life with someone else, we like to feel that we are independents and self- sufficient. The music, the images, the plot, each word that is said... They are just perfect.

180,williambuckner,Reflection in a Neon-lit Mirror,10,10 April 2015,"It has been a long time since I found myself thinking about a film long after it had finished. That is mainly because I don't think that I have seen a film that so perfectly reflects the subject matter at hand. I mean, there are many films like this such as Iran's ""A Separation"", Poland's ""Ida"", Britain's ""Lilting"" and Belgium's ""Two Days, One Night"" all so brilliantly reflect the directors feelings on a subject matter or social taboo. The Great Beauty decides not to merely identify an aspect of Italy, but instead brilliantly satirises Italy as a WHOLE through a dark yet neon lit reflecting mirror. Thematic elements such as vulgarity, excess, nihilism, a sense of un-fulfilment, religion, and dark humour all woven throughout the film makes it a wonderfully entertaining film, entertaining even despite its almost two and half hour run time.Italy's cinema history has been sketchy to say the least. Despite the Italians actually being the creators of European cinema, they quickly fell down hill after WWII. We both know that cinema either overtly, or even obviously, reflects the political situation of the country but it was in the sixties when many countries underwent a new wave of cinematic design. The French had ""Nouveau Vague"" (helmed by Francois Truffant and Jean-Luc Goddard) and Germany had ""German New Wave"" commonly lead by Werner Herzog. Then in the nineties this all changed when European Cinema lost its borders. Directors moved around from country to country making films so it is quite hard to say that films made in the nineties reflects a certain country in particular, instead reflecting the directors views. For instance, Michael Haneke has directed films in four different languages. This has since changed when Lars Von Trier sparked a change with the Dogma '95 Act (coincidentally, set in 1995...) which started a domino effect of change in European cinema.I wanted to say that last bit as a bit of background as while all this was happening, Italy didn't really do anything spectacular. It has been commonly regarded that Italy has in fact only made six good films. They are in no particular order; Bicycle Thieves, 81/2, Cinema Paradiso, Life is Beautiful , Rome Open City, and finally, The Great Beauty. All the films reflect Italy in a brilliant way. Rome Open City is Italy during WWII, Bicycle Thieves is Rome just after the war during its neo-realism stage in history, Cinema Paradiso and Life is Beautiful are when Italy started to rise again after a period of discontent. However NONE have shown Italy so well for what it really is in a way The Great Beauty did. That is because it fantastically shows Italy under Berlusconi's reign.Silvio Berlusconi enjoys excess, culture and really just anything teetering on the edge of being immoral. Director Paolo Serrentino knows this and decided to make a film that acts as a caricature of Rome. Interjecting the film with stark realism such as a limo driving by with a dead woman in the back and the protagonist's next door neighbour actually being a wanted political criminal without anyone knowing. This gives the impression that in Italy, nothing truly matters as long as you have money and stature. That to me was the most powerful part of the film.But the film revolves around a man who once wrote a book so great, he now 40 years later owns the social scene in Italy, in such a way that EVERYONE knows him. He enjoys wealth, enjoys stature, enjoys fame and enjoys the ability to influence anyone and anything. However, he has a deflating sense that he hasn't done anything with his life. He doesn't seek a quieter life, he instead wants to find ""The Great Beauty"" in Italy. Or so he thinks. I believe that it is down the viewer of the film to deduce that it is not the beauty of Italy that he needs to find, but the beauty of love and life. This is my conclusion as the only time he expresses emotion is when he is faced with the loss of a loved one. I don't believe that he is searching for the beauty of Italy as he owns it all. Being affiliated with Rome's royalty and having a private set of keys to all of Rome's secret treasures in which he can go to visit at any time, the fact that he only shows emotion and gratitude when dealing with love shows to me that this is actually the beauty he is so desperately searching for.",The Great Beauty

To be honest, this comes out a bit dry, but I really cannot put it any better to sum it up.
The greatness of this picture is not in the genius general idea, it is the beauty of the film itself, as well as all the wonderful smaller (but not small) ideas in those well portrayed scenes.
This film changed my view of the world, or, to be more precise, changed the way I want to look at it, at the world around me. All those beautiful, contrasting scenes from peaceful enjoyment of kids playing in the morning sun, to body and soul tangling parties and magic giraffes. Ah, a great beauty indeed, this movie.

184,bsw-26149,Beautiful and unexpected film,8,31 October 2016,"What a beautiful film. As has been written in other reviews, the themes of this movie are quite simple actually: getting old, the difficulty of appreciating the day-to-day, overcoming cynicism and all the beauty that we become numb to. What stands out is the unexpected choices Sorrentino makes in his direction. The ancient saint sitting atop a throne kissing the hands of assorted religious leaders as they approach one by one, only to kick off her right shoe like a little child. The CGI giraffe whose presence in the scene is a 40-foot underscoring of an important point. The blood on the head of an artist who runs headfirst into a wall, to the bemused and bored delight of the high-society crowd.This movie is as classically beautiful as any, but it is not content to stop there, always taking one step further, one risk more, and always in the most unexpected of ways.Highly recommended.",The Great Beauty
