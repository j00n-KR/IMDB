0,TheLittleSongbird,Quite interesting and entertaining,7,7 November 2011,"I do find Schumacher's films hit(Veronica Guerin) and miss(Batman and Robin), but the premise of Phone Booth seemed interesting, so I checked the film out. It was interesting and entertaining, but the script is sketchy with not much development to character, the ending is predictable and the story has several interesting and suspenseful moments but feels rushed towards the end. However, it is stylishly filmed, with some great camera work especially, Schumacher's direction is efficient and the soundtrack is compliments Phone Booth very well. The acting also helps lift, Colin Farell is very good and Forest Whittacker is solid as usual but the star turn was Kiefer Sutherland who was suitably malevolent as the caller. Overall, entertaining and mostly good. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Phone Booth
1,Leofwine_draca,One of the finest single-location suspense thrillers in existence,9,8 October 2016,"Larry Cohen's concept was originally offered to Hitchcock back in the '60s – but the auteur director couldn't figure a reason for keeping the guy in the phone booth for the whole thing, so it got delayed forty or so years until now. With CELLULAR, another hi-concept offering from Cohen focusing, this time, on a mobile phone, it's worth checking out PHONE BOOTH as it definitely stands out as one of the freshest films of the early 2000s, right up there with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy in terms of quality. Short, snappy and extremely realistic, to say much about the plot would be to spoil this one, other than the banter between Farrell and the killer has you on the edge, as well as the small-scale but riveting action and drama. This definitely one of the most suspenseful films I've ever seen, with the gripping story evolving so far that you'll be sweating as you watch this, right along with Farrell.The Irish-born star is top-notch in his leading role, consolidating his place as one of Hollywood's most promising A-list stars. The supporting cast is also great, with Forest Whitaker typically excellent as the detective on the scene, and ex-NEIGHBOURS actress Radha Mitchell as Farrell's wife. Although this film only takes place on one location, I would say it matches the thrills and tension seen in the likes of the DIE HARD trilogy, it's that riveting. A film to be watched more than once, PHONE BOOTH is definitely gonna be a hard one to beat in the years to come.",Phone Booth
2,SnoopyStyle,A gimmick movie that works,7,13 February 2014,"Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a fast talking publicist. Every day at the same time he calls young actress Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes) from a payphone. He doesn't want his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) to see the calls on his cell. Then a mysterious stranger (Kiefer Sutherland) calls the payphone. When the stranger shoots a guy, the cops surround the phone booth. Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) try to figure out what exactly is going on.This is quite a nice little thriller from Joel Schumacher. It's a tight little movie depending so much on the interplay from a faceless voice. It never gets gimmicky. The tension does wear thin even with such a short running time. They do need to update the phone booth idea. Even in 2002, that was already outdated. However, Colin Farrell is supplying tremendous energy in such a confined role. Kiefer Sutherland delivers the right kind of menace. The tension in the first hour is incredible. I think the movie needs someway to release some kinetic energy for the final third act.",Phone Booth
3,claudio_carvalho,"A Simple, But Very Suspenseful Thriller",8,9 May 2004,"Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a publicist, who lies to his clients pretending to be more important than he is. He is married with Kelly Shepard (Radha Mitchell), but he has a sexual interest in his client Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes), a beautiful aspirant to actress. Stu is trapped in a phone booth in Times Square by a sniper and by the New York police, under the command of Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker), accused of killing a pimp who was shot by the sniper in front of the cabin a few minutes ago. The sick sniper wants Stu to confess and humiliate himself in front of the cameras, threatening Kelly and Pamela with his rifle. The police is not aware of the existence of the sniper and believes Stu has a gun. This movie is an excellent thriller, having an excellent director and cast. The running time of 81 minutes is perfect for the plot. On the behind of scenes on the DVD, Joel Schumacher tells that this film was shot in ten days, ten pages of the screenplay per day, in the sequence of the story and without the cast knowing the screenplay. Therefore, the actors and actresses were also anxious to know the end of the story. A simple, but very suspenseful film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil):'Por Um Fio' (`To Hang By a Thread')",Phone Booth
4,kosmasp,Please hold the line,7,22 July 2007,"Spoilers ahead, as indicated above, so do only read, if you're OK with me talking about what happens in the movie! Can a man trapped inside a phone booth be suspenseful for the length of a feature film? It seems that he can! Or better the movie can. The movie is almost completely in the phone booth, but at the end they steer away from it (logically, to get the man responsible). Kind of like Speed meets Hitchcock, but with a bit of a message. A message carried by Keith Sutherland, but still the part of the movie, that in my eyes is the worst! Trying to make the villain human is one thing, but giving him sort of kudos at the end, is another. It almost ruined the movie (experience) for me ... I can't say how that affected your judgement of the movie, but that's something you have to make up for yourself! :o)",Phone Booth
5,gavin6942,Larry Cohen with a Big Budget,7,10 August 2017,"Stuart Shepard (Colin Farrell) finds himself trapped in a phone booth, pinned down by an extortionist's sniper rifle.Unfortunately, with Joel Schumacher directing, this film is just too slick, and has an MTV style. The script is dynamite, the acting is solid, and even the suspense is extremely well done. But the style is wrong, and in the hands of another director this might have gone from ""really good"" to ""great"". (Though, ""really good"" is still really good.) In early August 2017, I spoke with writer Larry Cohen. Although he was generally happy with the film, he felt its biggest flaw was not shooting in New York. That is an interesting point. To those who have never been to New York, this simulated version is probably good enough. But to New Yorkers, it must have seemed really fake.",Phone Booth
6,jboothmillard,Phone Booth,6,16 September 2005,"I was told by a few people that this was good, and I saw maybe a few clips of it, so I was certainly not going to miss the opportunity, from director Joel Shumacher (Falling Down, Batman Forever). Basically New York publicist Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is fast talking and wise cracking, but he is also dishonest because he is married to Kelly (Radha Mitchell) but having an affair with girlfriend Pamela 'Pam' McFadden (Katie Holmes). Every time he wants to speak to Pam he does it in the same street phone booth, as his wife checks his calls, and it is from this same phone booth that he innocently answers from an anonymous Caller (Kiefer Sutherland). Stu is told by this voice he knows everything about him, his business and obviously the lies he has been telling to his wife, but also he is also watching him. But then the danger really kicks in when he says that he will kill him if he hangs up the phone and leaves the booth, he is watching him through the telescopic sight of a rifle. When a man outside the booth demanding him to get out is killed by the psychopath shooting him, Stu is obviously mistaken for the shooter and the police led by Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) soon show up. As time passes Stu tries anything he can while staying on the phone to get help, prove his innocence, and when both Kelly and Pam show up at the scene. The Caller wants him to confess all his lies to Kelly, and obviously point out Pam to her, and while he stays on the phone Ramey, the rest of the cops and technicians are trying to find out what is going on. Stu is forced into doing what he says, but he is shocked then however to see that he has a weapon in the booth in the above light panel, so he is trapped there and could be caught even more guilty looking. After finally coming out with the truth to his wife and the girlfriend Ramey and the police may have found the location of the Caller, Stu comes out demanding he shoots him is desperation to end it, instead the cops shoot him to end it, but the final moment sees the Caller himself say that he must stay loyal, or he'll call again! Also starring Paula Jai Parker as Felicia, Arian Waring Ash as Corky, Tia Texada as Asia, John Enos III as Leon, Richard T. Jones as Sergeant Cole and James MacDonald as Negotiator. Farrell is good as the man tortured with words and trapped on the phone, Whitaker does well as the Captain trying to help the situation, and of course Sutherland with his gravely voice is fantastic as the malevolent Caller, it really grips you with all the words and the tiny twists and tense set pieces, a very worthwhile thriller. Good!",Phone Booth
7,Woodyanders,"A strong, tense and gripping thriller",8,17 July 2007,"Sleazy, smarmy and arrogant New York City publicist Stu Shepard (a bracing and bravura performance by Colin Farrell) finds himself trapped in a phone booth by a cunning sniper (splendidly voiced to skin-crawling sinister perfection by Kiefer Sutherland) who wants Stu to come clean and confess to his indiscretions. Joel Schumacher's sharp, stylish, agile direction maintains a snappy pace throughout and wrings a lot of sweat-inducing suspense from Larry Cohen's clever, concise and witty script. Farrell effortlessly carries the picture with his remarkably brave and dynamic portrayal of a shady and amoral hustler par excellence; he does an especially impressive job of making the initially unappealing Stu more likable as the story unfolds. The uniformly bang-up acting from a fine cast qualifies as a major asset: Forest Whitacker as rational, sympathetic Captain Ed Ramey, Radha Mitchell as Stu's loyal, loving wife Kelly, Katie Holmes as sweet aspiring actress Pamela, Keith Nobbs as naive eager beaver protégé Adam, John Enos III as hostile pimp Leon, and Pamela Jai Parker, Arian Waring Ash and Tia Texada as a trio of sassy hookers. Matthew Libatique's slick cinematography works wonders with a single confined setting, astutely capturing a palpable sense of claustrophobic tension and using split screen with genuinely dazzling results. Harry Gregson-Williams' shivery, rousing score, the often wickedly funny dialogue (""TV brings out the worst in people; you will be fine""), the pleasingly tight'n'trim 81 minute running time, and the gritty, flavorful Big Apple atmosphere are all sound and on the money as well. A very solid and satisfying thriller winner.",Phone Booth
8,ccthemovieman-1,One Way To Get Your Message Across!,8,19 March 2006,"I only looked at this because a friend loaned it to me so, at zero cost, what could I lose? Well, it was a lot better than I anticipated. Oddly, even though it's only 80 minutes long, I think this could have been better with about 10 minutes chopped off. It starts to repeat itself too much near the end. You have to remember, almost the whole film takes place within a phone booth!Colin Farrell does a super job playing a sleazy guy held captive in the phone booth by a threatening sniper-caller. The story, although simple, holds your attention because there is great suspense, innovative camera-work, an involving story that hooks you in pretty fast and some great sound. I hope you have a surround sound system because the caller's (Keifer Sutherland) voice on the other end of the line is something to hear!There is a big moral message in this film, too, about doing the right thing and paying for your sins, which Farrell sure did. It was really refreshing to hear that message, effectively told. Maybe some of us need a sniper to get the message across, but I hope not! Are there holes in this story? Sure, but it's still good and has a cool ending. The only warning I would give readers here is the language: this is a very profane film with Farrell going overboard on the f-word. If that offends you, then stay out of this phone booth; otherwise, it's pretty entertaining",Phone Booth
9,rmax304823,The Godhead.,6,29 August 2011,"A young man answers a public phone in an open space in New York City. A voice tells him that a rifle with a telescopic sight and silencer is trained on him and that he must do whatever he's told or he'll be killed. He does what he's told.It's the kind of dumb idea that sounds as if it might have made a good half-hour episode on ""The Twilight Zone."" But actually it succeeds in generating a lot of tension.The man trapped in the booth is Colin Farrell, a shallow show-biz promoter who is married to the skinny but seductive Radha Mitchell and is, at the same time, boning another girl, Katie Holmes. He's a sinful moron on the hedonic treadmill whose chief interest is in Italian shirts and self aggrandizement.At first, Farell laughs off the pronouncements coming from the phone. (The voice is that of Kiefer Sutherland.) He thinks it's some disgruntled ex client making idle threats. POW. A silent bullet strikes down a burly man nearby. The passers by scream and run for cover, believing that Farrell shot the man. The police, led by Forest Whitaker, are called in and Farrell is soon surrounded by dozens of cops with pistols and assault rifles all aimed at his head. The television cameras are on him and his image is soon broadcast all over the city, bringing his wife and his girl friend rushing to the scene. All this does is add a couple of additional possible targets.What can the Voice of Sutherland possibly be getting out of all of this? I mean -- what does he WANT? The voice hems and haws, enjoying the unfolding moment, cackling once in a while, taunting Farrell in his helplessness.Ultimately, it turns out that The Voice knows just about everything that Farrell has done wrong and this humiliating and fearful trap is part of his punishment. The Voice might as well be that of Yahweh himself, the Old Testament God with the bad temper, who kicked Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden and banished them to the Land of Nod.The punishment really is bothersome too. Farrell shifts abruptly from the smooth-talking snake-oil salesman to a man genuine afraid his head will be blown off at any moment. Boy, does he sweat good.But that formula is limited in extent. Farrell can only sweat and twitch so often, and Sutherland can only shoot so many people without giving the game away.So The Voice becomes that of the New Testament, offering a chance at redemption and, perhaps, forgiveness. All Farrell has to do is lean out the door of the phone booth and shout his sins to the avidly listening crowd. The booth has turned into a confessional. Farrell complies, but not to please Sutherland. Rather, because he wants to get it all off his chest anyway.Ha ha, says The Voice (and the viewer). The voice informs Farrell that he's going to have his frontal lobes removed anyway -- except that the quick-witted Whitaker has figured out what's up, that there's a sniper in one of the windows surrounding the public square.The ending leaves room for a sequel. If there were ever any doubt that this was no more than a successful thriller with commercial aims, that open ending should resolve it. I guess there was never a true sequel. What would a sequel look like? Sutherland traps Farrell in a public phone booth TWICE? And then has him do one hundred demi pliés while the crowd stares and twits him? Then he moons the crowd? So -- no. No sequel exactly. Just an imitation: ""Liberty Stands Still"" (2002) with Linda Fiorentino on a cell phone, handcuffed to a fast food cart in a crowded public square.",Phone Booth
10,Tweekums,"A taut, short thriller",9,16 May 2018,"Stu is an obnoxious New York publicist who lies to the people he deals with and calls a woman, who isn't his wife, from a phone booth so his wife won't find out. One day as he is talking to his other woman a man approaches the booth with a pizza that he says somebody has ordered for Stu... he is rudely sent away. Moments after he hangs up the phone rings and he answers... an unidentified man is on the line. He starts giving instructions to Stu and lets it be known that he has the area in the sights of a high powered rifle. Soon afterwards a man who tries to force Stu to leave to booth and is shot; those around claim Stu shot him and soon the booth is surrounded by heavily armed police demanding that Stu hand over his weapon... which obviously he doesn't have. The voice on the phone continues to goad him, trying to force him to do things that will both ruin his relationships and probably get him killed. Outside the booth police Captain Ed Ramey tries to negotiate with Stu and both women in his life arrive at the scene.At only an hour and twenty minutes in length this film is definitely shorter than most; I didn't feel short-changed though as for most of the film it was incredibly tense despite the fact that it was basically just a man talking on a telephone. There is some early action when a pimp tries to force Stu out of the box before being shot by the sniper but after that it is just a question of whether he will shoot somebody else or whether the police will shoot Stu. Colin Farrell is brilliant as Stu; for almost all of the film he is on screen; the centre of attention. Forest Whitaker is impressive as Captain Ramey and Keifer Sutherland is menacing as the sniper even though we only glimpse him at the end of the film... often poor performances are described as phoned-in but this phoned-in performance is great! Director Joel Schumacher does a fine job keeping things really taut as the story plays out in real time. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good tense thriller but don't want to spend ages doing it.",Phone Booth
11,moonspinner55,Everyone is on the phone in New York City!,4,24 May 2008,"Joel Schumacher's mercilessly overheated ""suspense"" drama has cocky publicist Colin Farrell trapped in a phone booth by a sniper who knows all his dirty secrets. Seems cell-phone addict Farrell uses the public phone to ring his girlfriend, thus his wife of one year won't get suspicious when she sees the bill. Beginning with the caveat this slick, smarmy player is actually married (to a clean-cut good girl!), none of the details in ""Phone Booth"" manage to convince, least of all the psychopath (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) who turns out to be smarter than his victims and the entire New York City police department combined. There's a surprising amount of talent behind this film, but it's a one-trick pony, resting on a mighty thin script which doesn't allow for any spontaneity. Farrell does a good job under the cramped circumstances, but Forest Whitaker's police Captain seems to take an awfully long time to assess this situation correctly. So, the hookers across the street saw a gun in Farrell's pocket? Well, they must be right! Aren't prostitutes the most reliable witnesses in the Big Apple? *1/2 from ****",Phone Booth
12,paul_haakonsen,Would you answer the phone?,5,21 September 2012,"I always put off watching ""Phone Booth"", because it stars Colin Farrell, whom I am not particularly much fan of. But I must take my hat off for him in this movie, because he really did a good job.The storyline in ""Phone Booth"" is rather simple, but quite captivating and thrilling. It is a movie that is based on emotions and really running on how well the actors were able to use the spoken words. And the banter between Stu (played by Colin Farrell) and the caller (played by Keifer Sutherland) was really great, it was witty and sharp edged. And that is what made this movie work well. But the performance by Forest Whitaker was also quite good, as he usually always deliver a good performance.""Phone Booth"" is not the type of thriller that will have you riding high on adrenaline or suspense, but it will keep you entertained in the sense that you want to know what happens next and see the outcome of the situation.And for a movie that didn't make use of a lot of locations and stages, then ""Phone Booth"" pulled it off quite well. I enjoyed this movie from start to end, and found it to be a rather interesting plot.",Phone Booth
13,blanche-2,"Made on the cheap, but it doesn't show at all",8,30 March 2010,"""Phone Booth"" - an excellent, suspenseful, scary 2002 film was made in ten days, basically in a phone booth on a New York City street, and the results are amazing. The film had no luck but because of its quality, wound up being very successful. It was held for release the first time because the powers that be wanted Colin Farrell to become well known. When that happened, it was held up again because of the sniper that ran rampant in Washington, D.C. Finally, ""Phone Booth"" saw the light of day.Colin Farrell has a tour de force as Stu Shepard, a fast-talking, low-level, wheeler-dealer publicist who walks the streets of New York talking on his cell phone and fielding other calls with the help of an apprentice publicist who follows him around. Because Shepard is married and his wife sees his cell phone bills, he steps into a an 8th Avenue phone booth to call a young woman (Katie Holmes) he's attempting to seduce. At this point, he gets a call from a sniper, ""Bob"" (the voice of Kiefer Sutherland) in a nearby building, and the man has a gun pointed right at him. Shepard can see the laser beam right over his heart. ""Bob"" apparently been responsible for several street shootings recently. When prostitutes harass Shepard so they can use the phone, their john comes over, and the sniper shoots him. It's assumed Shephard killed him, and the police are called.Farrell does a terrific job as a man who gradually realizes how bad his situation is and is forced by the sniper to do and say what he's told to do and say - and it's not always comfortable, particularly when his wife (Radha Mitchell) and almost girlfriend show up. Forest Whitaker is very effective as the captain trying to figure out what's going on.""Phone Booth"" was written by Larry Cohen, who after 38 years, is still grinding out excellent product. The company I worked for many years ago used to type his scripts, and I had the privilege of meeting him once in his beautiful New York City home. After writing multiple TV movies and shows for series like ""Columbo,"" as well as low-level independents, this Joel Schumacher-directed film is a wonderful and deserved coup for him. Don't miss it.",Phone Booth
14,wes-connors,Smooth Operator,8,1 January 2009,"Captivating director Joel Schumacher imprisons cocky publicist Colin Farrell (as Stu Shepard) in a Manhattan ""Phone Booth"" for almost the entire length of this eighty minute movie - and, the result approaches amazing. Mr. Schumacher's cinematic sense, and willingness to experiment, is worth of comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock. Most obviously, this film is ""Rear Window"" in reverse. Note how successfully both directors keep you, and their protagonists, is their opposite settings. Of course, Mr. Hitchcock (for a small sample of his ""phone booth"" usage, see ""The Birds"") would have done several things differently in a feature-length ""Phone Booth"". For example, the ""menacing"" toy near the beginning of the film would certainly have been owned by an annoying kid. And, the film's moral compass ends up strangely askew. Still, Schumacher, cast, and crew keep you on the line.******** Phone Booth (9/10/02) Joel Schumacher ~ Colin Farrell, Kiefer Sutherland, Forest Whitaker",Phone Booth
15,michaelRokeefe,When a phone rings...,7,28 February 2004,"Director Joel Schumacher preserves his reputation with a script by Larry Cohen about personal morals and hopefully the truth providing some kind of redemption. This is a white knuckle nerve wrecker about a self-serving publicist(Colin Farrell)making the mistake of his life by answering a public telephone. On the other end of the phone is a self empowered mad man(Kiefer Sutherland) inflicting demands on the fast talking, fast thinking publicity dealer who just happened to be walking by the phone booth he passes every day. The mystery voice on the phone demands the publicist to stay in the phone booth until he tells his wife(Radha Mitchell)and the TV watching public of his cheating, lying and making use of others. Of course behind the demanding voice is a sharpshooter that is not afraid to pull the trigger. The senior officer on the scene(Forest Whitaker)tries to make sense of the situation while fighting back thoughts of his own past personal problems. At least 90% of this thriller is made up of witty, threatening and revealing banter between Farrell and Sutherland. And talk about a clever twist to end this flick. Also of note in the cast are: Katie Holmes, Richard T. Jones and Paula Jai Parker. Think twice about answering that ringing phone.",Phone Booth

17,hitchcockthelegend,Life alteration in a phone booth.,8,23 September 2012,"Phone Booth is directed by Joel Schumacher and written by Larry Cohen. It stars Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Rahda Mitchell, Katie Holmes and Kiefer Sutherland. Music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Matthew Libatique.New York City publicist Stu Shepard (Farrell) is a liar, a cheat and an all round weasel, but that is about to change when he enters a phone booth and finds himself at the mercy of a long range sniper who has him in his sights.In real time and set in practically one location, Phone Booth is not your standard thriller. Held back from its original release date due to the sad Beltway Sniper Murders in Washington D.C., Phone Booth proved to be worth the wait. A simple premise for sure, but for the brief running time of just over 80 minutes, tension rises with each quarter as the stakes get upped by outside forces until the deconstruction of one man is complete. Schumacher and Cohen deftly stitch satire into the narrative, while the director also indulges in some nice visual tricks with his camera. He also garners a great sweaty performance out of Farrell, firstly cocksure and in love with himself, latterly layered with mounting panic and sympathetic yearning. Outside the booth the picture is well served by Whitaker, Mitchell and Holmes. The former a wise cop who tries to grasp the situation and avert Stu's death, the latter two as love interests in opposite wings.It's not all perfect, the first turn of nasty events involving hookers veers too close to comedy, there's a couple of daft implausibilities and as much as I personally liked the epilogue, I understand those that hate it and see why it proved to be an audience divider. Still, I found it riveting on thriller terms and funny as a satire, nifty, neat and not normal entertainment. 8/10",Phone Booth
18,Theo Robertson,A Highlight In The Resume Of Everyone Involved,8,28 June 2013,"Whatever happened to Colin Farrell ? A pretty boy Irishman he seemed to star in nearly every Hollywood movie being released at the turn of the century then he quickly disappeared as quickly as he appeared . Possibly this was down to Farrell star vehicles being the type of movies that are released in to the multiplex then are quickly forgotten . Director Joel Schumacher is another name from yesteryear who to put it kindly has a reputation as one of the worst mainstream directors to have worked in the industry . This reputation is ill deserved and mainly down to internet band-wagonism . It's difficult to defend the big budget mess that was BATMAN AND ROBIN from 1997 but Schumacher's output is no worse than any other journeyman director in Hollywood and PHONE BOOTH is a better thriller than a large number of Hollywood thrillers from the same era PHONE BOOTH works simply because it's not like so many Hollywood thrillers from the same period . The likes of Jerry Bruckheimer was giving gigs to the likes of Michael Bay and demanded light noise , loud soundtracks , explosions and car chases . PHONE BOOTH is in many ways the anti Bruckheimer thriller . It has a single setting of a phone booth in New York where showbiz publicist Stu Shepard answers the ringing of a public phone and finds himself being taught a lesson in respect and redemption by a hidden sniper Somewhat conscious that the screenplay by Larry Cohen might be a bit too static to hold the attention of the mainstream audience Schumacher decides to embellish the visuals with what American film critic David Boardwell describes as "" intensified continuity "" which in simplified terms is MTV style direction but actually works very well and much of this is down to cinematographer Matthew Libatique As bizarre as it seems at the heart of the subtext of PHONE BOOTH is a tale of redemption as Stu is forced to confront his shallow showbiz life as a publicist where careers are discarded on a whim . Cohen's screenplay is more than efficient for the vast majority of the running time but does suffer slightly from a twist at the end which probably isn't needed but for a film dealing with a person held at gunpoint by a callous sniper this is far superior to the almost identical LIBERTY STANDS STILL released at the same time",Phone Booth
19,jotix100,"Large pizza pie, no onions!",8,14 March 2004,"Having missed this tight thriller in its commercial run, I recently caught up with it on DVD form. Joel Schumacher is a director that has given us films that are clever and witty and hold the viewer's interest at all times.In this film, Mr. Schumacher presents us with a New York PR man, who is one of the lowest forms of vermin that populate and manipulate the media. He is ruthless. This is a man with no scruples at all; he is in for a rude awakening!This guy is in for the surprise of his life when he is caught in a phone booth, probably the last one standing in the streets of Manhattan! Of course, this is an allegory, perhaps his descent into hell. This man must think he is the king of the New York newspaper gossip column where he rules over the lives of other people. He is played brilliantly by Colin Farrell. All comes to a head when this character is threatened by an unknown voice on the phone that knows his very move. Is God taking revenge on this scum bag? Could that voice on the other side of the wire be his conscience calling him to a reckoning? Basically, the whole film is Colin Farrell coming to terms with his arrogance and being put down in his place by an unknown force, much too clever for him, or the police. The film has such an ironic twist that just when we thought we had solved the puzzle, we realize how wrong we were!Mr. Schumacher has directed with a sure hand and keeps the film to a frantic pace.",Phone Booth

Unfortunately this runs on for 80 minutes.  It drags ocassionally and has a really bad ending.  But it's well-directed with great use of split screens, Farrell is fantastic (as always), Sutherland's voice is just perfect and it does have some very intense, frightening moments--as well as some funny ones too.No masterpiece but worth catching for Farrell and Sutherland.",Phone Booth

22,poolandrews,Really smart & enjoyable thriller.,7,12 October 2007,"Phone Booth is set in New York where Stu Shepard (Colin Farell) lives & works as a celebrity publicist, Stu calls a girl named Pamela (Katie Holmes) who he is stringing along from the last public phone booth in New York on the north side of West 53rd Street between Broadway & 8th Avenue. When done he puts the phone down but it starts to ring as he is about to leave the booth, curious Stu picks it up only to discover some real psycho on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland) who has a high powered sniper rifle aimed right at him & will kill him or an innocent bystander unless he does exactly what he wants...Directed by Joel Schumacher I have to admit that against all expectations I thought Phone Booth was a great thriller. It's Larry Cohen's smart fast moving & original feeling script which is the films main strength, set almost entirely in one location the premise which revolves around a guy stuck in a phone booth doesn't initially sound that promising but the script is really absorbing & pulls you into the intense situation Farell's character finds himself in which plays out during the film in real time like the TV series 24 (2001). It manages to have a swipe at the media & the police while it makes you question just who is the bad guy, I mean Sutherland's character is obviously doing wrong but he's doing it with good intentions. At less than 80 minutes in length the time flies by, it never lets up for a second & once it has you hooked on the interesting premise it doesn't let you go right until the very end & even then you'll still be thinking about the ending as the end credits roll. The character's are very well written, the situation is maybe a little silly & one could debate that it would be virtually impossible to emulate in reality. A much better film than I had expected & a really smart little thriller that'll pass 80 odd minutes like they were 80 odd seconds.Director Schumacher goes for sped up scenes, split screen techniques so more than one person can be seen on screen at once & goes for a bleached look as the film has a blue washed out tint throughout. There's also a really cool opening & closing sequence which show's what you can do with CGI computer effects if they are done properly. Apparently the film was shot pretty much in sequence & took a meagre 12 days to shoot overall. According the IMDb's 'Trivia Section' the sniper was originally played by Ron Eldrad but was replaced by Sutherland in re-shoots.With a modest sounding $10,000,000 budget (it made something like 15 million on it's opening weekend) this is well made essentially in the same location, shot on location in New York & in Los Angeles. The likes of Will Smith, Mel Gibson & Jim Carrey were all attached to Phone Booth at one point or another but I think it works well with a relatively low key unknown cast.Phone Booth is a really cool fast paced thriller that I enjoyed immensely, it's short, smart, gripping & original. I was impressed, very impressed.",Phone Booth
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Marvelous thriller,8,19 February 2006,"When you hear such a great premise, you want to get to see the movie as soon as you can... but when you hear that such a talentless hack of a director gets to be in charge... we're talking, the man who, until Christoper Nolan came and built a new foundation for it, ruined the Batman franchise, after Tim Burton created two(not equally, but still both) grand entries... you feel, shall we say, less inclined to. Bottom line, I gave up on seeing this at the theaters for that reason, and now that I've finally gotten to see it(on the TV), I certainly wish I had given it a chance to win me over, because tonight, that's just what it did. Schumacher may not possess much talent or directorial skills, but what he's got, he certainly puts to good use here. The film plays like an episode of ""24""(rather appropriate, with Sutherland in a role, one might say), everything happening in real-time and things being inter-cut and such. This, along with some very nice camera-work, keeps the intensity high and keeps the film moving constantly from the get-go. The plot is intelligently crafted and well told. The way it evolves ensures(if the intensity won't) that your eyes never drift off the screen. The characters are credible and interesting. The acting is top-notch, most notably by Sutherland and Farrell. The cinematography is masterful. The writing is magnificent. The villain is terrific, and the idea of keeping him hidden like that works excellently. The voice alone, maybe because that's all it is, a voice connected to a sniper rifle, is incredibly effective and scary. I read that Hitchcock originally wanted to do this in the late sixties... it's really too bad he didn't get a chance to. As good as Joel did, Hitchcock would have hit this one out the park. Very nice execution of a spectacular idea, but could have been just that little bit better. I recommend this to fans of thrillers and of the actors(I'd say of Mr. Schumacher, too, but I strongly doubt he has any). Definitely worth a look. 8/10",Phone Booth

Now they can mean the death of you. I'm sure Cinguverizosprint were behind this some how.O.K., any movie that can utilize the same setting for the bulk of the movie and still hold its appeal is a good movie. Joel Schumacher did an excellent job with this project as did Colin Farrell. Colin Farrell played Stu Shepard, a wannabe hot shot publicist that is caught up in his own image and has desires to cheat on his wife. He eventually gets caught in an elaborate and well thought out trap laid by the unidentified phone booth caller played by Kiefer Sutherland.It is another megalomaniacal movie in which the antagonist takes a holier-than-thou position and forcibly tries to get people to see the error of their ways. In this case, the bad guy tries and succeeds at getting Stu to at least admit his sins and openly repent. Even though you typically abhor and loathe the evil vainglorious characters, they always end up serving some good. Almost like the existence of evil being there so people can recognize what is good.The dialog and flow of this movie was superb. Other characters were introduced into the scene at good intervals to make sure the movie never got stale. The movie continued to hold my interest all the way up to the very end just because I wanted to see the end result. That is the mark of a good movie.",Phone Booth
25,evanston_dad,Hell Has Officially Frozen Over--A Joel Schumacher Film I Don't Hate,7,29 April 2005,"No one wanted to hate ""Phone Booth"" more than me, since I absolutely despise Joel Schumacher and almost every movie he's ever made. I've actually taken the trouble to think about who my least favorite director of all time is, and Schumacher won the booby prize. So blame it on my incredibly low expectations, but I really liked this movie. I agree with the other people here that the script is weak. No effort is made to develop characters--it seems as if the screenwriter began to add dimension to Forest Whitaker's cop and then thought better of it. But do you really want a lot of script in a movie like this? The film makers were wise to keep the running time to a swift 80 minutes, and while I didn't think they were especially clever in the set up or execution, it was competent enough to hold my interest.I was pleasantly surprised by Colin Farrell's performance. He's great, and does much more with what he's given than the material probably warrants. I watched this by myself, but was still slightly embarrassed to find myself moved by his speech in which he confesses all of his sins to the assembled crowd. Even as I'm writing this review, I can't believe I didn't find this display hokier, but I guess I was in the right mood at the time.This movie reminded me of the kind of ""B"" thriller they might have made in the 40's--slick, quick and not especially intended to impress. Frequently, because those films aimed low, they scored high, as does ""Phone Booth"" for me.Grade: B+",Phone Booth
26,AlsExGal,It's slightly obvious...,8,2 March 2019,"...with its snare-drum-tight 75 minutes of actual image-on-screen and 72 minutes once you shave off the opening that tells us a bunch of useless factoids about phones in New York City. Those details didn't matter back in 2003, and they matter less now.And at times its storytelling momentum is a little circuitous - the funny thing about the film is that the Caller tells Stu fairly quickly what he wants Stu to do, which is to confess his lustful heart and fake persona to his wife (Radha Mitchell) and his lover (Katie Holmes).But the movie does put the pedal to the metal once it gets moving. Part of it is that Farrell's performance - one of his first really big showcases - carries a confident energy that slides smoothly into overactive panic and shame. His confession at the end of the film is around two minutes of him declaring every vice in his life, and the way his voice cracks and fades into whimpers... his open-faced shame comes off deeply felt that its stageplay-ready verbosity isn't a strike against it but an opportunity for real emotional catharsis.Kiefer's great, too, and it's funny how his multiple attempts to create a backstory for his sniper trickster play like a pre-echo of Ledger's Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT. Like that villain, this one delights in ""big choice"" moral/ethical tests, and big story turns erupt from how Stu responds to those moments of choice.Joel Schumacher's direction of images isn't a slam dunk. The introduction looks like a Mountain Dew commercial from, go figure, the early 2000s, and a couple of oddball style choices (posterizing a scene's color when showing it from the Caller's perspective, using triple-fades when Stu's delirious) make sense in concept but look more distracting than evocative. But he and his editors and . Matthew Libatique (who lensed almost all of Aronofsky's films) find a strong frenzied look for the film that never tips over into incoherence. And the Brian De Palma split-screens add some extra panache. And he also directs a fantastic performance out of Farrell, so props to him on that.Also, the hookers are annoying, but I assume that's the point, and so... Godspeed, you overacting ladies. Hit me with those nails on chalkboard voices.Screenwriter Larry Cohen deserves some sort of award for writing two pretty great phone-based thrillers - the other is the excellent Cellular.Historical note - this film is probably unfairly remembered as sensationalizing the D.C. Sniper in the fall of 2002. The fact is, the film was done and ready to release when that event happened and was delayed in its release because of that.",Phone Booth
27,ferguson-6,Effective advertising for Caller ID,7,8 April 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Stylish thriller from sometimes brilliant/often mediocre director Joel Shumacher (Good - ""Falling Down"", Weak - ""Batman and Robin"").  Nice eye candy supplied by the beautiful Radha Mitchell (""High Art"") and the oh-so-cute Katie Holmes, still trying to break out of the ""Dawson's Creek"" shadow.  The usually brilliant Forest Whitaker is fine with his small role, but make no mistake, this is the coming out party for Colin Farrell.  Yes, he is the Hollywood bad boy of the moment, but he has proven to be more than capable on the big screen.  Quietly intriguing in ""Minority Report"", Farrell explodes on the screen in ""Phone Booth"".  Great face, great hair and great voice - Farrell has superstar stamped on his forehead, provided he keeps his head screwed on straight. His cocky bravado literally melts away under the pressure of outright fear caused by the creepy voice of the creepy Kiefer Sutherland.  This is a very short film, but the intensity never wanes over the 80 minutes.  Kind of a goofy ending, but doesn't really detract from the body of the film.  Looking forward to Shumaker's film version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" next year, which will also include Katie Holmes. Note to Colin Farrell: Don't blow this.

It stars Colin Farrell as a business man who lies to clients to excel until one day he picks up the receiver of a pay phone and informed that if he hangs up, the gun aimed in his direction will fire. He sees it as a bad joke until details are given regarding his affair to another client unknown to his wife. To complicate matters the caller contacts this client to inform her that Farrell is in fact, married. After a fatal incident, the police arrive on the scene. Interesting setup descends into a series of episodes between Farrell and the police, and Farrell and the caller. Conclusion is clever and director Joel Schumacher makes great use of a limited location. Farrell gives an exhausting sense of energy as an individual whose closet full of skeletons is about to be revealed but not without some redemption. Forest Whitaker does well as police chief in what could have been a mere standard role but he plays it out realistically. Radha Mitchell plays Ferrell's wife who receives a confession. Katie Holmes plays the client who will learn who Farrell is and her bad position. The voice on the phone belongs to Kiefer Sutherland but perhaps a little screen time would have played out more effectively. Strong theme regarding attitudes that eventually entrap us.

I, myself enjoy Collin's work so I enjoyed this film. Not tremendously enjoyed, but enjoyed all the same. I found it to be taunt and a bit suspenseful thanks in no small part to Larry Cohen's writing. That guy hugely under-rated.

I must have picked the DVD up for almost nothing and it has sat with others while I vaguely wondered why I had bought it. Rather annoying and bit off putting at first with video multi screens and flashy effects but once this settles into the phone booth - what a gem! Colin Farrell is so very good but so is Forest Whitaker in another vital role. Between them the two basically run the show but the fantastic script from good old Larry Cohen is a great asset and it was probably difficult to go very far wrong especially as this is virtually a single set film.

The photography around NYC and Times Square was great and that special phone booth drove me crazy. The film started out with a con artist who never stop lying and had everybody completely fooled until one fatal day when he made a phone call as his daily routine at the end of his baloney days work. It drove me crazy when he had to confess his sins to an audience, including his mistress and wife. The con artist turned his complete life around and even helped a NYC detective wish he had told the complete truth to his own wife. There is plenty of deep suspense that keeps you glued to the screen and your seat. Refreshing film and worth viewing.",Phone Booth
34,JamesHitchcock,The Lazy Man's Way of Film-Making,6,21 October 2016,"Alfred Hitchcock made a number of films in which the action is confined, or virtually confined, to a limited area, such as a lifeboat in ""Lifeboat"" or a single flat in ""Rope"" or ""Rear Window"". In the 1960s he had the idea of making a film in an even more confined space- a phone booth(or, as we Brits would say, a telephone box) - but abandoned the project when he could not come up with a satisfactory plot. Larry Cohen, the scriptwriter who had worked with him on that project, later revived the idea, and this is the result.Stuart Shepard, a New York showbiz publicist, has just finished making a call from a phone booth on Eighth Avenue when the phone rings. Stuart foolishly answers it and finds that the caller knows his name. Worse, it turns out that the caller also knows quite a lot about Stuart's private life and business affairs, matters that he was hoping to keep secret. The caller knows that Stuart is planning to cheat on his wife Kelly with a young woman named Pam. (It was Pam whom Stuart was calling from the booth; he dare not do so from his mobile phone in case Kelly checks his phone records). The caller also knows that Stuart has been fooling his clients by pretending to have much more influence in the showbiz world than is actually the case. He wants Stuart to make a public confession of his wrongs against Kelly, against Pam (who has no idea that he is married) and against his clients. Stuart tries to hang up, but the caller warns him that if he does, or if he attempts to leave the booth, he will be shot dead.Things then go from bad to worse. A man named Leon, angry that Stuart is spending so long on the phone and refuses to get off the line, tries to force his way in and starts smashing the side of the booth. The caller, who has a high-powered rifle trained on the booth from an overlooking window in a surrounding building, shoots Leon dead. Stuart still cannot get off the line, even when the police arrive. They suspect Stuart of being Leon's murderer but are unwilling to arrest him immediately as they believe him to be armed, so a tense standoff ensues.The plot is an ingenious one, and director Joel Schumacher manages to generate a good deal of tension. (The plot unfolds in real time; this is one of the few movies which scrupulously adheres to the classical unities of time, place and action). There is a good acting performance from Forest Whitaker as the police captain in charge of the operation. Colin Farrell copes well with the difficult task of working out exactly how Stuart should be played; he cannot be entirely sympathetic, because if he did not have a guilty secret the caller would have no reason to single him out, but he must never be so unpleasant that the audience lose all sympathy with him. ""Who cares whether the hero gets shot or not?"" is not a good basis for a thriller.The trouble, however, is that the plot is too ingenious. I could well understand why Hitchcock became dissatisfied with the basic idea and withdrew from the project. There is no real reason why Stuart, or anyone else, should spend an hour-and-a-half in a phone booth except to satisfy the requirements of a very contrived and artificial plot.Hitch, I suspect, would also have disliked the way in which Cohen and Schumacher treat the mysterious caller. The great man was fascinated by psychology, especially the psychology of the criminal mind, but this film never explains why the caller acts in the way he does. How does he know so much about Stuart? Why is he so angered by Stuart's minor dishonesties and why does he believe that public humiliation is the only fitting punishment? There is no suggestion that he is a friend of Kelly or Pam, and laughs off Stuart's suggestion that he might be a disgruntled former client. Why does he kill Leon, who does not appear to have done him any personal harm? Why does a man so intent on enforcing the commandment ""Thou shalt not commit adultery"" pay so little heed to ""Thou shalt not kill""? The film-makers simply brush all these questions, and others, under the carpet, hoping that the audience will not notice them.The real answer to all these questions is that the caller has to have this knowledge, and has to act in this manner, otherwise there wouldn't be a film. That, I'm afraid, is simply the lazy man's way of film-making. 6/10",Phone Booth
35,StevePulaski,Phone's for you,9,12 February 2012,"The last film I saw that utilized an actor's voice with such passion, fear, and excellence was Ted Levine's character, Rusty Nail, a truck driving psychopath destine for revenge, in the 2001 horror film Joy Ride. Along comes Phone Booth, a superb claustrophobic thriller from a director more than capable of delivering one. It packs all the vital pieces to construct a thriller from the ground up, and most importantly, never feels heavy-handed, slow, or noneventful. It also doesn't feel boastful, occupying a very short runtime of eighty minutes. Anymore and it would feel like a merciless exercise.Apparently, Phone Booth was delayed for several months because of fear it would spark controversy because of the Beltway sniper attacks happening all over Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virgina, acts I remember scaring me half to death to the point of me not wanting to go out in public. I think the perfect time to release this would've been in the eighties or nineties, when phone booths were big. The film knows that the premise is a bit shaky in 2003, mainly because it keeps referencing cell phones and how they're becoming the normal everyday thing, unlike phone booths. While it would've been best suited for a release a few decades ago, it still is perfectly acceptable in the present.What we get is an intense, devious, and relentlessly entertaining flick that works on every level. Our main character is Stu Sheppard (Farrell) a cocky, arrogant publicist who is debating on cheating on his wife with a young actress he has as a client. Because he is aware his wife checks his cell phone for messages, Stu goes into a phone booth to call the woman. Upon ending his conversation with her, the phone in the booth rings and Stu picks it up by a force of habit.The caller (voiced stupendously by Kiefer Sutherland) says he has a sniper pointing at his head and that if he hangs up the phone he will be killed immediately. The man knows Stu, his past, his wife, the girl he's cheating with, and pretty much every detail about him. He wants him to confess to both his wife and the actress that he has been unfaithful, but it's difficult to do that when you're being bombarded with threats from not only a caller, but some loud-mouth prostitutes who soon call over their pimp.Being that this is a film that takes place mostly in one standard setting, screenwriter Larry Cohen had a real challenge on his hands to write as much dialog as he could for Farrell and Sutherland to share. Not to mention, director Joel Schumacher, who already made the excellent Falling Down, had to find a way to direct the phone booth and Farrell themselves without the film feeling like a never-ending exercise of monotony. There are multiple picture-in-picture shots of different angles capturing the New York City, technically Los Angeles, metropolitan area.While the visuals are fantastic, the truly remarkable aspects, besides the writing and directing which never seem boring or cliché, are Collin Farrell's Stu and the caller himself. Farrell has a character that needs to act mainly in subtleties. For example, when Forest Whitaker, playing a cop, tries to get him to come out of the phone booth and piece together the details of this event, he begins to somehow know that Stu is in a lot of danger and that caller may not be the ""psychiatrist"" Stu says he is. Farrell and Whitaker need to communicate almost telepathically, and the result is very favorable.The caller himself is fantastic. Never would I have chosen Kiefer Sutherland to voice an unseen sniper. His voice is calm, fearless, authoritative, and manipulative. He means business and in his world, death is an option.Phone Booth is a terrific film in every sense of the word. The only thing I think it's missing is larger roles for its female characters. The wife and the actress seem to have such a big impact on Stu's decision making, but the downside is we never really hear too much about them or discover the real reason why Stu is cheating. Regardless, that aspect doesn't cloud the evidence that shows this is truly one of the best claustrophobic thrillers in many years.Starring: Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, Katie Holmes, and Kiefer Sutherland.

We do.The same thing happens to New York City publicist Stuart Shephard, when he thinks nothing of picking up a phone on a Downtown street. On the other end is an unnerving voice that tells Stu not to hang up the phone. Stu soon realizes that the man--whoever he is and wherever he is--has a rifle.

If Stu tells anyone who is on the other end of the phone, he is dead. The Caller wants Stu to confess his sins, which includes telling his wife why he uses a payphone every day instead of his cell phone.The reason is because Stu has been having a fling with a wannabe actress. The actress has no idea Stu's married. But when the Caller forces Stu to tell his wife the truth on television, everyone knows. But the Caller still won't let Stu go. He's never going to. Stu will be killed before the day is over.If the cops surrounding the place don't do something about it very soon.""Phone Booth"" is brought to us by Joel Schumacher, a man many hate yet many adore. He is the man responsible for the previous two ""Batman"" installments. Many claim him of ruining a series, when, in fact, the series was ruined by the first sequel. Joel Schumacher is too heavy on the darks in his ""Batman"" films, and his directorial efforts can be very bad. But he also brought us the wonderful character breakdown story ""Falling Down,"" a film I have been quoted as saying is one of the best films of 1993. He also brought us the Brat Pack film ""St. Elmo's Fire,"" the other Kiefer Sutherland film ""The Lost Boys,"" and, among others, the tragic ""Bad Company"" and ""8MM."" But ""Phone Booth"" has some of the attributes of all those films. It has some ""Falling Down"" in it, some ""Bad Company"" in it (shudder), some ""Lost Boys"" in it, and yes, even some ""Batman & Robin"" in it. But it's on the same level as ""Falling Down,"" i.e. it's a very watchable, if somewhat repetitive thriller.
My first impression upon seeing previews for ""Phone Booth"" was that I thought it had some real potential. Given the right dialogue and director, a boring situation can be turned into an intense one. Take, for instance, the scene where Stu is being commanded by the Caller to take a hidden handgun from the phone booth and wave it at the cops. We don't know how he's going to get out of it. But then when he does, we think to ourselves, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" I like thrillers that make a situation seem inevitible, then suddenly solve the problem. Colin Farrell sports a good New York City accent, and Kiefer Sutherland sports a good Willem Dafoe voice. He's creepy, strange, and thanks to the film's technique of Hitchcockian suspense, we don't see him. At least for most of the film.(Spoilers ahead)The ending is a two-bit surprise. It's not just one twist, it's two. When the first twist was revealed, I thought it was the solution to the film, and it fit together more than a film like ""Red Dragon"" where you know the killer's going to come back. But then there's another twist. It's amazing, chilling, and eerie. And when the credits started rolling, my heart was still pounding. And even though some people will think this movie is tremendous and others will think it is ridiculous, it kept me on the edge of my seat and rarely let me down. Give it a chance.And next time you walk down a street, think twice before picking up that ringing phone.**** out of ***** (four out of five stars)John Ulmer",Phone Booth

Mainly because I wanted to know how entertaining a movie can be, when it mainly centers around a phone booth. And it was a lot more entertaining and intriguing to watch than I expected it to be. Colin Farrell put on a good show, but the real star in this is Kiefer Sutherland ""The Caller"", he mainly plays the voice mostly but his character is still charismatic and intimidating to the point he really grabbed my attention with his dialogue. For a movie that was shot in 10 days with a very low budget, it really proves that you don't need a huge budget to make a entertaining and interesting movie. The exchange of dialogue in this is well done and will keep most audience on the edge and even suspenseful at times, even menacing. The story is basically about a antihero playing mind games with a egotistical publicist and it's blended in very well. There are some questions that is unanswered but for a film like this, it's sort of a good thing. The pacing of this is well done as well.7.8/10",Phone Booth

I'm not one to root for the villains in movies, but in this case, the villain flick really put Farrell's arrogance and infidelity in place, which was quite refreshing.The thrills take up much of the movie, but most of the comedy bits lie with the blabbering prostitutes; they were actually pretty funny.

A man (played by Colin Farrell) picks up a ringing payphone and gets caught up in a nightmare - the guy on the other end of the line is a sniper who threatens to kill him unless he stays on the line and does exactly as he's told. So, it's a simple movie - set almost entirely in and around this phone booth. That in this era of blockbusters was quite refreshing. The guy on the other end of the phone also knew a lot about Stu - here the story started to fall down a bit. The movie never identifies who the sniper is or explains the connection between him and Stu. That left me a bit bewildered (and, frankly, feeling a bit empty) as this came to an end. I'm not convinced that this wouldn't have been an even better movie without the obvious (but unexplained) connection between Stu and the sniper. There was a pretty good performance from Forest Whittaker as the cop in charge once the police show up on the scene after the sniper shoots a man but everyone assumes that Stu did it, and you feel for Stu's impossible situation as he tries to convince the police that he didn't shoot anyone and he's not armed, but he can't leave the phone booth (because if he does, the sniper will open fire.) So, even though I thought the story could have been improved, there was a lot here I liked.Here, though, is my biggest problem with this movie. It's all based on the assumption of the sniper that Stu would answer a ringing pay phone. The sniper narrates this with the words ""a ringing phone has to be answered."" Really? Over the years I've seen pay phones ringing with no one answering them. So, this was too convenient a plot device. Frankly - the narration aside - had Stu done what most people would have done and simply not answered the ringing pay phone, there would have been no story! It made the rest of the movie - even though there was a lot of it that I liked - seem a bit preposterous!",Phone Booth
43,sol1218,Terror On The Phone Line,10,3 March 2004,"""Phone Booth"" is a one of a kind thriller even though the movie is under 90 minutes long, a rarity now a days for a feature film, not a minute or even second is wasted in the movie.""Phone Booth"" could have easily been padded with extra and useless footage to make it seem impressive as a feature length film. It's film-makers wisely left it at 80 minutes which gave the movie the unrelenting and heart stopping action and suspense that made it the success that it is. Stu Shepard, Colin Farrell is a publicist who lives like the publicity that he gets for his clients which is for the most part an illusion. Stu grew up in the mostly low to middle class borough of the Bronx but he likes to dress and act like he's from the rich and luxurious Upper East Side and Sutton Place in Manhattan. This is Stu's way of trying to come across as super impressive to those who he works for, and those who work for him, as well as people that he meets socially. Sharp and fast talking Stu spins tales of him knowing and associating with top Hollywood and Madison avenue honchos as effortlessly as if he were ordering breakfast at the local neighborhood diner. This may be OK for Stu, it's part of his job, to BS people in order to get their attention and business. What really irked off Stu's secret and hidden antagonist is his infidelity that he has for his wife Kelly, Radah Mitchell. For some time he's been watching and planing to get Stu into a trap that he set for him on the corner of 53rd and 8th avenue. In a phone booth that Stu has been calling his girlfriend Pamala McFadden, Katie Holmes, so he wouldn't have to use his cell phone. Which Stu's wife Kelly could easily find who Stu has been calling from checking the monthly phone bill. Tense and powerful drama in midtown Manhattan with an excellent cast of characters. As the city is shut down by an unseen sniper who has a personal grudge thats reached public proportions. With the entire media focused on the private life of his helpless victim, trapped inside a phone booth, and forced to spill his guts out not only to those who know him but to the whole world on live TV. The movie is so packed with action that you can't believe that it's under 90 minutes long, it seems more like 190 minutes as your riveted to the screen throughout it's entire showing. ""Phone Booth""is another feather in the cap for Larry Cohen who gave us such low-budget but high quality classics over the years like ""It Alive"" in 1974 ""God Told me To"" in 1976 ""Q"" in 1982 ""Maniac Cop"" in 1988 and ""Ambulance"" in 1990. With ""Phone Booth"" possibly being the best of them all. What works so well in the movie ""Phone Booth"" is how the dialog and the action is synchronized in the movie. Where it practically telegraphs everything thats going to happen and yet still jolts you when it does, even as you see it coming! Strong and hefty performances in this small and modest movie by Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Radah Mitchell, Kaite Holmes, Keith Nobbs, Richard T. Jones and many many more that would take up too much space to mention; and lets not forget Kiefer Sutherland. ""Phone Booth"" is an action suspense movie that stands head and shoulders above all the big budgeted films with multi-million dollar stars that Hollywood has made through the years. ""Phone Booth"" is a powerhouse of a movie that never lets up for a moment of the 80 minutes it's on the screen and with an ending that will literally knock you out cold.",Phone Booth

45,ElMaruecan82,He had him at 'Hello' ...,7,17 February 2014,"Just like Tom Cruise a few years back (is it a coincidence Katie Holmes stars in the film?) Colin Farrel does a great job portraying an arrogant prick you'd love to hate. In fact, the director Joel Schumacher begs us for that as soon as the film opens.Basically, Stu never communicates without a cell-phone, and directs his life like all the workaholic businessmen we'd love to kick their asses once in a while. He's naturally followed by a boot-lick who treats him like God, he's got a wife, a girlfriend, but even these people are only agenda fillers and wouldn't compete with his greatest asset: an ego. In fact, Stu has such a big ego it wouldn't fit in a phone booth and this where his nightmarish journey with a mysterious caller will be trapped in.Right in the beginning the narrator tells us that when a phone calls, someone has to answer. Stu will commit the fatal mistake and as soon as he grabs it, his life would hang on a thread, a little red dot warning him that the caller rhymes with killer. That's the premise of Joel Schumacher's ""Phone Booth"", an interesting thriller superbly combining the claustrophobia of a small booth with the hugeness of a city, New York naturally, where each citizen tries to have one inch of space to breathe in. All through the film, we wonder if we should envy the man in the phone booth or the worm-like population evolving in the Big Apple.But there's no premise without a point, which the villain has to make so we know where he comes from, literally. During his long dialog with Stu, we start emphasizing with the victim in his position but in the same time, we try to understand the caller or killer's motive, and during their long conversation, Stu will make many encounters that will all play a part to the plot. A bunch of whores who need that phone booth to call their client, an immigrant vendor whose toy is shot to pieces (to prove that killer rhymes with sniper) we know there has to be THE fatal bullet, the one that will play a pivotal role by calling the Police, the ill-fated guy who gets it is a Pimp who only got it because his whores couldn't shut their mouths.At that time, I was perplexed; I thought no matter what point the killer was supposed to teach, yeah, the key word was 'redemption', I didn't think it had to cost the pimp's life. If we were to agree that Stu is a worthless human being, well, his life isn't worth more anyone. So with one person dead, what's left for us to root for the killer, except a sort of charisma and some black humor. But Schumacher doesn't leave us much time to mourn the poor pimp, the Cavalry comes, the TV vultures join the party and the fun starts. It's obvious that Stu will be regarded as a killer, but thankfully, the script doesn't turn the Captain into a stupid guy, well he was played by Forest Withaker, that's a good sign.Captain Ramney feels something fishy, if Stu is trying to be killed in purpose, no way, he wouldn't give him that pleasure, now, we're relieved. This is where the killer's behavior gets weirder, he orders Stu to ask the most awkward question to the Captain. Naturally, Ramney understands that Stu is taken in hostage and start looking at the buildings, another good sign. It's also interesting that later, he tells Stu's wife that he divorced and went into therapy. The question is: how can a villain so capable of quickly reading a man's personality in a glimpse of an eye make the hostage say the very words to clear him. This is going way too far but the strength of ""Phone Booth"" is that the plot goes faster than the script. It's a film shot in real-time, and the caller-killer hasn't time to waste. Obviously, the mysterious caller rhymes also with ringmaster, one of a show that can only culminate with a breakdown.Which leads to the obligatory confession, saved by Farrel's emotional performance, he opens his heart, asks for forgiveness to all the people he hurt, and it's with that relief that he can finally shout at the killer, waiting for any bullet to stop him. The Police finally identifying the call get to an apartment and find a man who apparently killed himself before they come: a corpulent pizza deliveryman, the same who was dismissed by Stu, in his prick's days, one hour earlier. I guess no one bought this ending, if only because the killer's voice is pretty identifiable, and no one would value his life lower than a stranger's redemption. The ending comes fast enough to comfort us about our intelligence.Indeed, we understand this is one of these stories where the villain gets away with it. And the film, which can be seen as a 'Dog Day Afternoon' of the 2000's shows how everything gets back to status quo in a city where things run so fast, they're quickly forgotten except that Stu must NOT forget his experience, and the knowledge that the killer is still alive is perhaps the best warning he could have. As far as storytelling goes, ""Phone Booth"" is far and solid entertainment, but it left me wonder if it really deserved the death of two men who had nothing to do with Stu in the first place. If the killer was so concerned by Stu's behavior, he should have question his own contempt for life as well.Apparently, the director wised up and left the film without a second part. But maybe for once, I wouldn't have minded a sequel where the killer would be in Stu's place, and see where it can go, whoever calls him  obviously Stu.",Phone Booth
46,MOscarbradley,One hell of a B-movie,7,10 April 2006,"Colin Farrell is terrific as an obnoxious New York publicist whose sins finally catch up with him when he finds himself trapped in a phone booth by a sniper, (voiced to perfection by Kiefer Sutherland), who threatens to kill him if he hangs up. What develops is a stand-off situation with Farrell caught between the sniper and the police and although the action is confined almost entirely to the phone booth and the street around it, director Joel Schumacher makes brilliant use of that once much over-used and now hardly ever seen technique of splitting the screen to show the action from various viewpoints.The premise isn't particularly new but Larry Cohen's script is a model of its kind and once upon a time would have made one hell of a B-movie, (it clocks in at around eighty minutes). In this case, less is indeed more. Farrell is virtually never off the screen and is fast becoming one of the best young actors of his generation while Forest Whitaker is equally good as the sympathetic policeman trying to make sense of it all.",Phone Booth
47,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A simple premise executed simply brilliantly.,8,30 March 2018,"A simple premise executed simply brilliantly, this taut, tense and genuinely gripping thriller does more with its single location, few key characters and short, concise 88-minute run-time than most pictures of the kind can even hope to achieve - doing so on an independent budget and with a shooting schedule of just ten days (with two days for pick-ups), to boot. On reflection, the narrative and certain character motivations of 'Phone Booth (2002)' may seem a little thin and a few of its bizarrely schlocky and very nineties elements stick out like sore thumbs - including a slightly nonsensical opening and ending which both have no place in a piece of this calibre. It's the in-the-moment intensity that rockets this experience up past most others in the genre, though, as it is an unpredictable, engaging and edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride throughout with a stellar lead performance and a fantastically frenzied pace. Highly entertaining, energetic stuff. 8/10",Phone Booth
48,dromasca,Refreshing,8,27 August 2003,"This film is different from the usual Hollywood stuff. A guy (acted by Colin Farrell) gets nailed in a phone booth in Manhattan by an invisible snipper at the other side of the line. He is far from being a bad guy by our current standards, but he is blackmailed by the snipper open his life and reveal his little dirty secrets first to his wife and girlfriend, and later to the local and national TV which show up on the spot - of course, together with a regiment of NYPD. The story is not fully bullet-proof, and some more logic could have helped. However, it is well acted, and the director Joel Schumacher put into story more artistic logic, which is what counts. Though similar fixed location stories have been screened previously, this film looks fresh and different in the context of the recent seasons. 8/10 on my personal scale.",Phone Booth
49,g-bodyl,"Very Taut, Tense Thriller!",9,16 August 2014,"Phone Booth is a much better film than I expected and what truly amazes me is how this thriller works with practically a single location, which is a public phone booth in New York City. Not only does this film work as a thriller, it also scary. I don't think I'll be able to pick up a ringing phone in public ever, which is impossible to do nowadays. This film started slow, but once the voice chimes in......bingo! Joel Schumacher(yes, the guy who did the atrocious Batman & Robin), directs a very clever film about a man who is obnoxious, self-centered, and a very big liar. But he makes the mistake in picking up a ringing pay phone and on the other side is a voice that will change everything in this man's life.Colin Farrell was excellent in this movie. We can easily see a transformation in his character from start to finish. He seemed to give off genuine fear and despite the person he was, I hoped his character would remain intact by the end. Kiefer Sutherland as the Voice was great, mainly because he has such a menacing voice that really works well.Overall, Phone Booth was an excellent thriller due it's simple premise, but rapid execution. It's very fast-paced so the film keeps rolling right along. With a single location, I never thought the film would be as tense as it is, but without Sutherland's voice, this film would be in the dead zone. I rate this film 9/10.",Phone Booth

53,tabuno,Surprising Suspenseful Movie Shot In One Location,7,26 January 2019,"4 April 2003. What is remarkable about Phone Booth is how the action and suspense can be sustained for so long with almost the entire movie shot in one location. Except the dorky opening music that eventually blends into a much more in sync sound, for two slight but irritating plot flaws, a relatively weak character development of the women in this movie, and a somewhat transparent ending, Phone Booth is mesmerizing with its unscene villian and the intensity and psychological rollercoaster that is presented on the big screen. Colin Farrell's character isn't the most likeable, even towards the end, there's still a question of redemption. The script for this movie and the acting required some tight and well thought out direction to keep this movie interesting and alive. While it bordered on becoming tedious, it never really disappoints. This is a powerful, compelling indepth look in the life of one man who must face the truth about his life.

57,johnnyboyz,"Like a sandwich with awful bread, but a damn good filling.",6,21 May 2006,"Phone Booth is a classic example of a simplistically made thriller which contains an easy plot consisting of uninteresting, two dimensional settings and tight, sharp, un-nerving dialogue. The one thing that springs out in good films in this genre is the characters. Everyone who has seen a Hitchcock film knows that Hitchcock is the master of suspense and thrillers in particular.'Psycho' revolved mainly around a very plain, everyday setting (a motel) and was reasonably simple plot-wise with the dialogue that I've described. The same with 'Rear Window', this time it's an apartment block, but the un-natural traits of some of the characters, most particularly the antagonist but not forgetting Jeff's obsession and persistence also, mixed with unusual activity which is going on behind the 'closed doors' in the film is given to us and the rest of the characters through clever little clues. These are the focus of attention, this is the important stuff. Thus, it is this element of the film that is important in films like Phone Booth and it does deliver rather well.In this thriller, it's a (surprise, surprise) phone booth which is the setting for suspense. The small, tight enclosed setting for the struggling protagonist, or arguably anti-hero, works well in this film and plenty of predictable close ups and fast edits are present. Another strong point of the film is the principle of the antagonist. He's unknown, unseen and is clearly in control of the situation, in fact we're told early on that he's done this sort of thing before. He's delusional, and although he's angry at liars such as our hero, he's not afraid to lie himself now and again about rather sensitive subjects such as difficult childhoods and over one mans struggle and bad experiences in Vietnam. I quote: 'Pigs picking at napalm burnt bodies and hand grenades planted in your boots', in fact there are a number of memorable quips and quotes planted throughout. So, here we have a creepy bad guy which is superbly voiced by Sutherland. This is a tick in the 'good' column.Phone Booth suffers from other things, though, mainly through the principle of the PROtagonist (The good guy). Nobody likes a liar, especially in films and unless the genre is crime and everyone is as greasy and slippery as each other; a liar, a cheat and a full of himself PR is hardly a great list of traits to give a guy we're supposed to root for for an hour and a half. In fact, it's very difficult to sympathise with someone like this, even if his life is threatened.Another thing is the point of attack in this film, or the 'setting of the stage' which is very poor. Character introductions make up a good part of this section, as well as any past trauma our hero has suffered, but no  not here. In fact, the opening fifteen minutes of this film is amongst the worst I've ever seen. Granted, there aren't many characters to introduce but we're given some rather disorientated scenes involving a 'p-in-p' (picture in picture) technique and the entire build up of ten minutes or so is just our hero, the good guy, mouthing off and proving to us what, to be honest, a complete jerk he is. We are shown a little of his good side when we realise he cancelled a meeting to be with the girl he likes, but that is immediately distinguished when we then realise he's using her to cheat on his wife. This isn't how you set the stage.Another problem I had with the film was the final act of the film. Some things are just best left unknown. This is what makes for a good ending, especially in the thriller genre. Some endings I can refer to are 'Reservoir Dogs', and 'Saw'; two films set pretty much in the same place for the duration of the film if you exclude the flash backs, and two films that have endings which although are worked out after time as to what EXACTLY happened, can still leave that question mark feeling over your head when you watch them now and again. This is how a film like Phone Booth should have ended.I'm not analysing the conclusion too much due to risk of a spoiler warning but I will tell you it's weak. The concluding camera shot and SFX merely suggests the film has some sort of 'loop' to it but this is something I've only really seen 'Twelve Monkeys' do with some real effect in the last ten years or so, and as a result  it doesn't work well here.Phone Booth isn't a bad film; it's just let down by a number of things that could have been avoided with better writing. The first fifteen and last fifteen are terrible but the actual battles that happen within the film between Farrell and Sutherland are pretty good. It mixes suspense, good dialogue and reasonably tense situations nicely to create a nice little pressure cooker.Don't worry about the direction or the camera work in this film but the editing and split screen effect does drag on.I'm sure that if Hitchcock was still alive, I doubt he'd be using that effect in his films and look at how well he did.",Phone Booth
58,TheMovieDiorama,Phone Booth dials up its millennial tension through suspenseful confined calls.,6,5 November 2019,"Joel Schumacher is a rather inconsistent director. Unusual, yet capricious. From 'The Lost Boys' to 'Batman & Robin', his career has been considerably scattershot in terms of quality. Phone Booth, whilst quintessentially being a product of its time, happens to be his most simplistic. An arrogant publicist is held hostage in a phone booth by a mysterious sniper who offers him an ultimatum.A hyperbolised exercise in absolution from an absurdist's perspective, Schumacher delivers a nail-biting thriller from the confinement of one besmirched public booth. Unscrupulous sex shops on one side of the grubby New York street, and a religiously inclined series of posters dictating ""who do you think you are?"" on the other side. It may just be a lightning paced disposable techno thriller to many, but if you divulge into the finer details you'll notice it is overwhelmed with morality. The repentance of sins. Cleansing the soul from immorality. The harsh tones of Sutherland's antagonistic voice, likening himself to a higher (or lower...) entity, offering Farrell's Stu a chance for redemption. A surprisingly thematic endeavour for Schumacher, whether intentional or not, the religious symbolism in its subtle visuals or literary narrative were certainly profound.It smooths out the neo-noir roughness that forces this thriller to be nothing more than disposable entertainment. Aside from Farrell's strong performance as the arrogantly unlikeable Stu and Sutherland's menacing tone, the supporting cast were mediocre at best. Whitaker, Mitchell and Holmes rarely had an opportunity to shine within the mucky street and had a tendency to overact. The act of forgiveness, whilst being a pivotal point to the whole ordeal, seemed incredibly vacuous without much deliberate intervention. All too easy, considering how long Stu kept his unfaithful behaviour up for. Cohen's script was sharp and concise, occasionally stagnating in moments of desperation when not knowing how to progress the hostage situation further.Stevens' editing was swifter than Sutherland cocking his sniper rifle multiple times. On screen graphics to display scenes running simultaneously, such as police officers tracing the encrypted phone call, keeping the pace consistently tight. Some of visuals, such as the red dot from the sniper, obviously smelt of fakery as well as the space effects showcasing the satellite sending communications to mobile phone chips etc. Y'know, common tropes from films created in the early naughties.As I said, it's very much a film of its time. Yet despite the rough disposable nature of Phone Booth, it's a much more entertaining call then being on hold for an hour and a half. I can tell you that from experience...",Phone Booth
59,marmar-69780,Phone Booth,8,30 September 2020,"Phone Booth is one very good suspensful thriller that has great use of the said tension and atmosfere that worked in a very good way and it offered me some good storytelling and some important lessons that can be also used in a real world to.Collin Ferrel was very good here and he may give one of his best performances ,he was somewhat cocky in beginning but story progress forced him to change a bit and to treat other people a lot better then he did.Kiefer was also good and he had a very intimidating voice that yelled full of anger and hate in a great way,Phone Booth was a good underrated thriller",Phone Booth
60,Anonymous_Maxine,Can you hear me now? Goooooood.,10,26 April 2003,"The first thing that interested me about Phone Booth was the fact that the whole movie took place on such a limited physical area. A lot of people that I had talked to about it before having seen it said that they thought it would be boring because of that, but on the contrary, a limited set like the one in the movie is a VERY good sign, because you can see from older movies that (with the exception of relatively dull ones like 1999's Deterrence), limited sets not only imply, but REQUIRE good acting, good direction, and most of all, a good story. All of these and more are found in Phone Booth.I admit that the overall message of the movie is a little bit preachy, with Keifer Sutherland playing the part of the God-like watcher who goes around punishing low-life New Yorkers for their crimes, but the thrill of the film is there. Colin Farrell, whose eyebrows are rivaled only by the unbeatable Freddie Prinze, Jr., delivers a spectacular performance as the cocky public relations representative who goes through life feeding lies to everyone he meets, including those closest to him.I loved how the movie takes such a simple premise and keeps it going so well. When I first saw him enter the booth and pick up the phone and start talking to the killer, I knew that, if I learned anything about the movie from the previews, he had to stay in that booth on the phone for the rest of the movie, and I wasn't sure how they were going to manage to keep it interesting or that long, but they definitely managed it.
(spoilers) It's true that the whole situation works out a little too perfectly for the killer's plans, since everything that he wanted to happen happened, but this is a highly entertaining thriller that entertains and delivers a great message at the same time. There is a particularly impressive interaction between Stu (Colin Farrell) and Captain Ed Ramey, as Stu needs to let Ramey know what's going on without letting the killer in on it, which is difficult and exciting since the killer can both see and hear everything that Stu does. It's great the way that the killer has fun with Stu, demanding that he say offensive and disgusting things to Ramey and to his own wife, especially when you realize that Ramey is beginning to realize what's really going on. This is a challenge, of course, because of the excessive oddness of the whole situation (which Ramey sums up as soon as he arrives on the scene  `Let me get this straight. This guy shot that other guy and then hung around to make a phone call?'). The end of the movie is where it falters a little bit, although there is a great twist involving the pizza guy, which was pretty interesting, although if they had left it with that it would have been a letdown because Keifer Sutherland's voice it too well-known to be passed off as this other guy's. It was pretty believable though, kind of reminds me of that thing that Kevin Spacey pulled as John Doe when he dressed up as a photographer in Seven.
But where the movie falters a little bit is the part where the killer wanders up to introduce himself to Stu while he's laying in the ambulance. I thought that was a great turn of events, but it's the point in the movie where it approaches, just barely, but distinctively, the point of being altogether to preachy and cheesy. This is where it introduces the suggestion that the killer is just some guy out to rid the world of injustice and clean the scum off the streets with his sniper rifle. The pimp was just another dirtbag that he purged while attempting to get through to a more complex one, and the pizza delivery guy and the walking and talking robot were both collateral damage. There was some great commentary about the capacity for stupidity of the LAPD (Michael Moore was a little more blunt in this area toward the NYPD in his TV show The Awful Truth), as well as about the greed of the human race in general as the killer taunts Stu about all of the tourists pointing video cameras at him, hoping to see some shooting so they can sell their tapes.
The only problem with the message of the film, about cleaning up the streets of these filthy people, is that if snipers cleaned out all of the sinners from the human population, not many people would be left. Maybe Phone Booth will someday help people to realize that sinning is part of human nature, and that 100% of the human race sin at some point in their lives. The hope is that they can come out and admit their faults, the way Stu does at the end of the movie. Imagine the relief.",Phone Booth
61,jzappa,Cameras Watching Cameras Watching Farrell Being Watched,9,25 October 2011,"Phone Booth drops in on a glib, faithless Broadway media spokesperson who is using the last phone booth in Manhattan when he's entrapped by a sniper. The shooter seems to play either God, calling for a confession, or the filmmakers, taking their voyeuristic vengeance on publicists, and exercising an all-out impulse of the most excited voyeuristic urges and idiosyncrasies. The movie turns out to be a discourse between three very vivid present-tense characterizations, but it's Farrell's to make or break, because he's on screen literally the entire time, and he gives vigor and force to every shot. But every shot puts that pressure on him. We see an utterly ubiquitous array of perspectives, from the magnified sight of a sniper rifle to a screen split into two or more, sometimes way more, to fish eye lenses to news cameras. The shameful skeletons Farrell's desperate closet are being mercilessly forced into a feast of a thousand eyes and ears.The man as whom Farrell explodes with nerves in those cross hairs is Stu Shepard, who we've already seen stomping the streets, fibbing into his cell phone, scolding his miserable minion. Why does he now use a pay phone rather than his cell? Because he's calling his mistress, Pamela, and doesn't want the call to show on the bill his wife, Kelly, will see. The phone in the booth rings and Stu abides by the collective human custom of answering it. The voice is callous, mocking, sounds like it belongs to a man clever and warped, and with a sense of humor.Throughout relentless action that plays out for little longer than an hour and fifteen minutes, Stu will be attempting to stop the voice from pulling the trigger. The voice seems to know a lot about Stu, those delicate skeletons, but also things anyone could see, like the way he impolitely treated a pizza delivery man. He seems to feel that Stu is a blameworthy man who ought to die, and might, unless he can talk or think his way out of his circumstances. Or, and Sutherland's ability to be sinister is so eerie it neither implies nor negates this, he just views these tiny figures down below like insects, vulnerable little things at the mercy of his magnifying glass. Morality could just be his effortless tool with which he toys with this cocky ant. When you were a kid, didn't you sometimes break your toys, kill one, crash one, light it on fire?It's a very modest, efficient film. Schumacher is the director of several runaway successes, like two of the Batman pictures, but on occasion he leaves the big budgets behind. He shot Phone Booth on one set in 10 days. It's more or less a paranoid Twilight Zone-style microcosm, and it's not a shock to discover that Larry Cohen, the writer, created the concept decades ago, when there were still phone booths and morality plays. If the movie had been imagined in today's script development climate, Stu would've had a dose of hero worship in how economical he is with fidelity and the truth. As the predicament swells in pressure, anxiety and suspense, he develops a connection with Capt. Ramey, a cop played with a charming vulnerability by Forest Whitaker, practiced in hostage situations who initially thinks Stu may be the predator and not the prey. The two actors have to interconnect nonverbally to keep the intimidatingly observant sniper from realizing what's going on between them, and it's thrilling to watch them figuring that out.For the voice of his sniper, Schumacher acutely taps the key to Kiefer Sutherland's talent, having collaborated before in The Lost Boys and A Time to Kill, and here takes the mostly concealed role as a fantastically valuable good deed for Schumacher, for if the voice doesn't work, neither does the movie. It does. The way Sutherland teases Stu and just can't help but break into sadistic laughter in that unmistakable hoarse voice is something that will always get under my skin. He is the pure sadist manipulating all we see for his own gratification. ""You know like in the movies just as the good guy is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun. Now why didn't he have it cocked? Because that sound is scary.""",Phone Booth
62,FiendishDramaturgy,Suspenseful mind game,8,1 October 2003,"This movie is fantastic on many levels.While it is highly entertaining, it is just as disturbing. The thought of someone knowing your life, your routine, the most intimate details of your private world...how genuinely perturbing.This production is very thought-provoking, extraordinarily written and the direction is surprisingly coherent, considering it was done by Joel Schumacher, the guy who DROPPED THE ATOM BOMB on the Batman series! (the badly done Batman Forever and the horrid Batman and Robin). The characters were well developed enough to allow the audience to care what happened to the lead, and the talents of the thespians involved were very well used and displayed. Though, in my opinion, Forest Whitaker's was above and beyond any other performance in this entire production.I could go on and on, but I will refrain. I do not even intend to outline the plot here.

64,freemantle_uk,I don't like this film,2,7 August 2008,"When I first heard about Phone Booth I thought that it sounded like a good idea, a indie thriller set in one place. However when it came to watching the film I didn't like it.The basic plot of the film is Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a publicist who lives a very amoral life. He is married to one woman (Radha Mitchell) and having an affair with another (Katie Holmes). He makes his phone calls from the last phone booth in New York. From this a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) who has been watching Stu for a while decides to get attack Stu using mind-games and tricks and if he got out the booth the sniper would kill him. Because of the actions of Stu the media and the police become involved.There are a few reasons why I don't like this film. Firstly I didn't think that this film's script was well written and I didn't believe in it. Secondly there was a likable character in the film so you end up not caring about them. Thirdly this was the start of Colin Farrell becoming a lazy actor and it was not a particular good performance in this film. Finally I just thought that film was boring.It just best to avoid it.",Phone Booth
65,dfranzen70,No dial tone,4,20 October 2003,"It was quite a intriguing premise, really. A man answers a ringing phone in a booth in which he's just made a call. A man's voice promises that if he hangs up or leaves the booth, he'll be shot dead.If you were that man, would you have the nerve to hang up?
What if you further found out what the potential killer wanted, and it wasn't money or anything on your person? What if he wanted you to apologize for something?Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a hotshot New York publicist who systematically walks over everyone he meets and lies to those who can help him. He's been carrying on an affair with a struggling actress named Pam (Katie Holmes, looking cute as a  button as always) while married to Kelly (Radha Mitchell). In fact, he's just gotten off the phone with Pam when the phone rings ominously. ""A ringing phone must be answered,"" we're told as the movie opens, although I'm not so certain that's true. I myself feel no strong urge to answer a ringing pay phone, as it's generally not for me.But Stu does answer it, and the voice on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland) has him in his trap. Hang up, you die. But it's not long before other people are involved - otherwise, it'd be a quick or at least awfully dull movie - and sure enough a group of prostitutes wants to use the phone. Only Stu can't hang up, so they get their pimp Leon to take care of things. Leon smashes in the side of the booth, and the killer - provoked according to his own code of what is bad and what is not - shoots him down from above, although we never know quite where.And that's what really gets things going. Soon the prosties are getting the cops, and there's a big standoff, with Stu still clinging to the phone, refusing to give it up. Of course, the killer is telling him what to say to the cops, warning him that if he doesn't comply, Stu will be killed. In the interests of self-preservation, Stu does comply.Interestingly enough, the killer's complaints about Stu center around his perceived selfishness, his look-out-for-number-one attitude. And yet it's that very attitude that keeps Stu alive. If he were the Good Boy that the killer wishes he were (he wants Stu to atone for his past transgressions, such as lying to his wife), then Stu would have been dead. Life's funny sometimes, ain't it?Of course, the police have no idea there's a killer on the other end of the phone. They're operating under the assumption that Stu killed the pimp, and that he's armed. In most movies where there's a police standoff, the cops might act a little differently, choosing instead to rush the phone booth. But the cop contingent is led here by Captain Ramey, played by an earnest Forest Whitaker. Whitaker is always a treat to watch, with his hangdog eyes and self-serious expression. He's easily the best part of this otherwise tepid film (much as he was in last year's Panic Room).  Ramey instead chooses to talk Stu down, to discern what the actual threat is. His character is thoughtful but tough, choosing to place himself in danger .
The movie runs only 81 minutes, but it's still too long and probably would have been better served as an episode of an anthology series, like the old Twilight Zone or Outer Limits series. It's interesting to see the character development of Stu Shepard, but in the end the viewer still doesn't care too much about him.",Phone Booth

He does his daily routine to call a young pretty actress Pam (Holmes) who he is dreaming of, though he is still very much in love with his wife Kelly (Mitchell). After, someone calls the booth and Stu answers, getting told that if he hang up, he will die. Problems then arises when other people really wants to use the phone, which Stu can't let them, and the sniper who holds Stu hostage shoots one of them. Police is called on to the scene and Stu, who gets blamed for the murder, is treated like one. A very interesting situation arises when police tells him to come out of the booth and the sniper tells him that if he does, he will die. And of course, he can't tell the police what is really going on. The snipers demands is that he reveals and confesses all his sins, as both Kelly and Pam arrives on scene. The dilemma also gets worse when the sniper threatens both Kelly and Pam as well as the police in charge Capt. Ramey (Whitaker).This is a great movie right up to the end. The suspense is very good, the acting is superb, especially by Farell and Sutherland, even if we only get to listen in to Sutherland's voice. He really does the role as the sniper magnificently. Then there is the end. I don't really know what I want instead of what happened, but the end as it is does not come up to the high standards of the rest of the movie. One thing I think would have been better if we never got to see the sniper. Not very funny for Sutherland perhaps, but his great performance by voice only, and the character of the cold intellectual sniper, is somewhat diminished when he appears. I would have liked an end where we never see the sniper better. If that end included the snipers death, Stu's death or Kelly's and Pam's death or not I don't know.Very well, to conclude, a very nice story with a lot of suspense and mystery, masterfully played and directed, cut short by a premature and not perfect ending. Still, very good.8/10",Phone Booth

Just because a movie doesn't have explosions or other typical movie conventions, at least it was well paced and well put together (even if it was in just one location. While Kiefer Sutherland's role got a little preachy near the end of the film, at least it had a somewhat intriguing premise. Colin Farrell showed some actual acting ability, which displays his possible staying power in the industry.

74,Jonny_Numb,"fine exercise in ""confined cinema""",6,22 April 2003,"""Phone Booth"" is a lean bubblegum thriller that knows its audience, and makes the most of its confined setting and split-screen images.  The tension mounts respectably (the use of zooms, fisheye lenses, and different film stock complement the action), and director Joel Schumacher, who has a bad reputation of mucking up his own films, curbs most of his heavy-handed tendencies (namely lots of neon and high-stunt spectacle).  Colin Farrell's big ""confession"" scene is the only moment where the movie smacks of melodramatic schmaltz.  Following in the footsteps of last year's ""Panic Room,"" ""Phone Booth"" is another exercise in 'confined cinema' that's not as deep or endearing, but, at 80 minutes, passes quickly and is never dull. (One complaint: the opening sequence, which indulges in slo-mo, fast-forward, zooms, split screens, and an out-of-place voiceover narration, plays out like a commercial for AT&T.  I almost expected the disembodied voice to ask me to switch my long-distance service.)6/10",Phone Booth

76,rosscinema,Tense drama,6,29 May 2003,"Here's a story that writer Larry Cohen first talked to Alfred Hitchcock about in the 1960's and its taken this long for it to get made. If your a writer and you sold a script to Hollywood I probably wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it to get made! Story is about a man named Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) who is generally not nice to people and uses them as he pleases and suddenly as he walks down the street while using a pay phone he gets a call from a mysterious stranger who some how knows a lot about him. The caller tells him to start doing things or he will kill someone because he has a rifle. After arguing with some prostitutes a guy comes over with a baseball bat and tries to attack Stu when the sniper shoots him. People on the street think Stu did the shooting and they call the cops. The sniper has also placed a gun in the phonebooth to blame him. The cops arrive and Captain Ed Ramey (Forest Whitaker) is in charge of the scene and now they don't know what to do. The sniper makes Stu admit to many things to everyone like telling his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) that he has a mistress named Pamela (Katie Holmes). Director Joel Schumacher does a good job of keeping the story and the film down to about 90 minutes so the action that takes place comes fairly rapidly. The best thing about the script is the way that it makes the protagonist cleanse his soul to everyone around him. The sniper makes him yell to all listening that he is guilty of infidelity. This is Farrells first big starring role and he does a good job of keeping the viewer interested even though 90% of the time is spent in a phonebooth. Story is unusual and unique and even though its farfetched the film doesn't come off as contrived. Rather, its a pretty absorbing drama and it reminded me that Schumacher can be a very effective director. Not a great film, did anyone really believe that its New York? And we get the obligatory side story of cop Whitaker trying to remain in charge of the situation while being berated by another law official to get the job done or someone else will be in charge!

77,nycritic,A Conceit That Delivers,8,19 February 2006,"Man and his relation to a tight space, when caught in an unexplained situation, is the theme of Joel Schumacher's film PHONE BOOTH written by Larry Cohen who would reverse the scene for CELLULAR. A gimmick which could have buckled under its own weight, this short movie takes off like a rocket and for 80 solid minutes proceeds to tell its remarkable, tense story.Telephone booths have been interesting spaces to use as plot devices. In THE BIRDS, Hitchcock enclosed Tippi Hedren in a very British phone booth as a mass of seagulls engulf Bodega Bay and all but dive bomb through. In ROSEMARY'S BABY, Rosemary Woodhouse was seeing her world crack right before her eyes as she awaited a fateful call inside a booth. However, these were individual scenes -- never an entire suspense thriller. PHONE BOOTH begins and ends its story in one. Stu Sheppard (Colin Farrell), not a very nice guy, learns what it is not to have control as he picks up a ringing phone (an action many New Yorkers do as if this were an everyday occurrence) and encounters a voice on the other side.This voice (Kiefer Sutherland) orders him not to hang up or he will kill him. It's that simple. And the point is taken when the unseen owner of the voice shoots a pedestrian inches from where Stu stands, ensuing a progressive chaos on the streets and a battle of wills as both parties try to survive this deadly game of cat and mouse. No plausible reason as to why this man is doing this is given. It just is.Much like the similar CELLULAR the plot in PHONE BOOTH is a gimmick and one that requires a prompt presentation, execution, and conclusion. Schumacher, a director with no autonomous style, is great at building tension and bringing events to an explosive head, and while the final sequence rings a little false, for the most, this is a solid, airtight plot that manages to kick ass. Forest Whittaker, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes also co-star.",Phone Booth

It's a relatively short movie, but it's better this way. You don't want to watch the guy standing there for more than 90 minutes.

79,screenman,Thank Heavens For Mobile Phones,8,23 March 2011,"If Hitchcock were alive today he'd be kicking himself that he never thought of this simple but terrifying premise. Because it's definitely him. The good news is; it's unlikely that he'd make a better job of it.Bizarre psycho murderers have become so common on the movie menu that I'm inclined to give a big yawn whenever they show up. And I made a start with this one. But I stopped.An arrogant young snot walking past a phone booth when its phone starts ringing, steps inside to answer and finds it's for him. The caller is a stranger who knows all about his life. But the real bad news is that he has a sniper-rifle with a telescopic sight, pointed right at him. If he steps outside - he's dead. Moreover, if he doesn't do pretty well anything he's told to do - he's also dead. Terrifying, definitely bizarre, but it's oh so simple.Our schmuck is put through seven circles of hell as all manner of peripheral events impose upon his plight. The psycho at the other end of the line just plays him like a tune.The most disappointing element of the movie is that the only person we get to know well is the schmuck in the booth, and he's a ruthless, two-timing, spineless snot. It's very hard to empathise with him. Everyone else, including his wife, girlfriend, sundry police-officers, hookers, pimps and the like just fit certain predetermined character profiles and nothing else. They're competent, but they're not people we get to care about.The premise of this movie is so simple, and allows for such an economy of scale in terms of movie creation that the idea is a piece of genius. More alarming, however, is that this could actually happen. Even if the loony-on-the-line didn't know all about you and wasn't an electronics wizard; reprising this plot in the real world would be just as easy and economical. All that would be needed would be to know the number of a phone booth within line-of-sight, ring and wait till somebody - anybody - answered. Then give them a real bad day. I'm surprised there hasn't been a copycat.This is tense, suspenseful, often unpredictable in detail, highly original, and dead simple. If character development had been more detailed and sympathetic; it would have been a classic. Otherwise that is its fatal flaw.At least for an interim, I suspect this movie did for telephone boxes, what 'Fatal Attraction' did for one-night stands. I found it ultimately predictable in denouement and a wee bit disappointing, but it was a brave effort nonetheless.",Phone Booth
80,brando647,"Such a Good, Underrated Film with Great Performance from Farrell",8,12 April 2010,"I know I've ripped on Joel Schumacher in the past for his ridiculous treatments of the Batman franchise but PHONE BOOTH is proof that the man isn't all that bad. The entire film is set within the confines of a single location with minimal characters and he has created a tense thriller that keeps you honed in until the final moments. The film focuses on publicist Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell), a fast-talker with a nasty habit of using others for his own personal gain. In the end, it's his complete disregard for others and his attempted infidelity with aspiring actress Pamela (Katie Holmes) that brings him to the attention of a sniper with a love of teaching lessons. On his daily visit to the only remaining phone booth in New York to call Pamela, he receives a call from the sniper who's got Stu in his sights. The course of the mere 80 minute film has Stu pinned inside the phone booth while cops gather to arrest him for an apparent murder while the sniper drives him to confront his over-bearing flaws and promises to end it with a bullet if Stu hangs up.I was drawn to this film for the novel concept of the entire story occurring within a phone booth. With such a handicap, I know some filmmakers wouldn't have been able to accomplish a gripping story but Schumacher does just fine. This was made possible with some great casting choices. Colin Farrell had a lot riding on his shoulders since we was the primary focal point in the film and spends a great portion of the time speaking into a phone rather than interacting with others face-to-face. This was my first real exposure to Farrell (I hadn't yet seen TIGERLAND at the time) and he blew me away in this movie. On the other end of the line is Kiefer Sutherland as the sniper/caller. The man has the best possible voice, creepy and powerfully demanding. It's the perfect voice for a psychopath who has less than two minutes of screen time. Forest Whitaker is Captain Ramey, the officer who takes it upon himself to get behind the situation and find out what's really going on in that phone booth. Whitaker's great, but it's not all that deep a role so it doesn't give him much to work with.This is a great film and it's flaws are few and far between. It definitely requires some suspension of belief, as some of the decisions made by the police and some of the sniper's actions are hard to believe would have gone as they did. Still, this story's focus is the interaction between Farrell and Sutherland and the character transition of Stu Shepard as he's forced to confront what a piece of garbage he's been. In that sense, the film succeeds and it's a great display of talent from both Schumacher and Farrell.",Phone Booth

Why does Stu have to call Pam in a phone booth everyday? Becayse his wife, Kelly check his phone bills so she doesn't noticed that he has been cheating on her.I have to admit it. I did cry a little. The way the film brings out the emotions is just powerful. This movie will also keep your heart pounding. The whole movie takes place in a phone booth the whole time, as you guessed.

This is a very ethic thriller.Good script by Larry Cohen. Very well directed by Joel Schumacher.",Phone Booth

For a movie that didn't stray a block away from the phone booth where Stew stood for the duration of the film, it was intense and caught your full attention, with an urge to know what happens next. It's intense in the way that out shooter talks and takes charge of the situation, with that calm and deep voice over the phone, and the excellent acting of fear and stress and helplessness of Stew by Colin Farrell makes it really deep and watchable. This movie would have been very hard to make perfect, and somehow they got it pretty much as perfect as it could have been made",Phone Booth

86,michaeltrivedi,Top Notch Entertainment,7,16 November 2019,"Yes! Colin Farrell shines in Phone Booth, and I don't think any of his other work compares. He's the cool, Brooklyn accented agent for the stars. He sleeps around with attractive women, and is both loved and hated by the world. He's that kinda guy, the guy you can't help but like. And all of this is uncovered by the audience in only one day of his life.Phone Booth takes place in a phone booth in New York. Poor Colin Farrell is being held up in the booth by a caller who seems to know everything about him, and will kill him if he leaves. All his issues and secrets are uncovered to the world, as the police and news crews get ahold of what's happening.This movie is a real treat. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was popular when it came out, though I don't feel that sense of awe about it. But Farrell plays the cool guy very very well. And the other cast is good too. The mystery surrounding it is also fun to watch. Claustrophobic movies at their best.7 stars! Deserves 8",Phone Booth

The ending would have worked if it was a horror movie.  But it isn't.  So Keifer got away with it...  No storyline to speak of.  It was all suspense. So for the most part this movie surprised me.  I'd heard some really bad reviews.  But it wasn't all that bad and except for that stupid ending.  It was a good moral movie.

88,IonicBreezeMachine,A high concept hook and a strong central performance result in a taut and tense thriller,7,9 January 2021,"Fast talking publicist Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is contemplating an affair with a young actress he manages. He calls her from the titular Phone Booth so he can call her without his wife knowing, however when he picks up a call from a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) Stu finds himself playing a dangerous game that may cost him his life.Directed by Joel Schumacher and written by Larry Cohen, the movie's origins trace back to the 1960s when Cohen first pitched the concept of a film set entirely around a phone booth to Alfred Hitchcock, Hitchcock liked the idea enough, but an inability to find a compelling reason to stick to the phone booth resulted in the project being put on the back burner. Cohen revisited the concept in the late 90s which introduced the plot element of a sniper which began to make the plot take shape. The movie went through a number of development stages with Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Robin Williams, and Mel Gibson were intrigued at one point in starring, and Steven Spielberg even passed on the opportunity to direct which he has come to regret. The final version starring Colin Farrell and directed by Joel Schumacher while flawed still is a great example of high concept suspense.Colin Farrell plays Stu Shepard in a terrific performance as a fast talking publicist who's used to getting what he wants by making empty promises and verbal magic tricks to get people to do what he wants. The early scenes where he's jumping between clients and newspapers on his cell phone serve as good setup as well as character building for when Stu finds himself trapped in the phone booth. Kiefer Sutherland is equally great as the unnamed Caller who plays up the menace to terrifying effect, but also handles so moments of pitch black humor as the Caller plays mind games with Stu dropping ""hints"" to his identity and reasons why he's doing this which may or may not be real.Despite a good hook and script, the movie does have some drawbacks. While the acting from the main cast is pitch perfect including a good turn from Forrest Whitaker as Captain Ramy who tries to de-escalate the situation, there's some moments of overacting that boarder on obnoxious such as three hooker characters whose deliveries are overly shrill and screechy. There are also some editing and directing flourishes used by Schumacher that took me out of the movie because I found them more suited to something like a music video than a movie such as this which I think could've benefited from a more grounded and less stylized approach. But these are minor points in the grand scheme.Phone Booth is a taut, lean, and well made thriller that takes a simple premise and runs with it. Strong performances and decent direction result in a movie that doesn't overstay its welcome and makes for a tense and engaging experience.",Phone Booth

90,blott2319-1,"Far-fetched and a missing something, but still a decent thriller",6,22 September 2021,"Of all the movies I've seen from Joel Schumacher it seems Phone Booth might be the most restrained. The acting is still big and the action is extremely dramatic, but isolating the events to a single street corner keeps this from becoming too wild and crazy. I was appreciative of the tension that they were able to create with such a simple premise. You could sympathize with the protagonist and the fact that he was boxed in with no way out of his situation. Each time you thought he had a chance to escape, you realized the danger that loomed over each decision. I was definitely invested in how it would end, because they had done such a marvelous job of creating this no-win scenario. I can't say that the ending was as satisfying as I would have liked, but at least I wanted to get there.I did struggle with Phone Booth, because it was a tad far-fetched in concept, and the behavior of the characters. There are certain events in the film that I don't think the caller could have predicted, and yet he had completely planned for all of them. However, my biggest problem with the film was the fact that the sins of Colin Farrell's character weren't shocking enough. There's a sadistic quality to the caller that implies there are deep and dark secrets waiting to be revealed, but he had next to nothing that would surprise anyone. I suppose it was a choice that the writer made to keep the protagonist from becoming completely unsympathetic, but it undermines the extreme measures being taken by the one holding him hostage. I still liked the drama in Phone Booth, but it was lacking enough in execution that I can't see myself watching it again.",Phone Booth

92,Stampsfightclub,Taking the concept of claustrophobia even further,9,24 March 2009,"Publicist Stu Shepherd (Farrell) becomes the target of an anonymous caller (Sutherland) when he enters a Phone Booth in a busy New York street.The claustrophobic thriller genre has taken a wild swing in formation over the past few decades. Whether it is David Fincher's portrayal of a Panic Room or Wolfgang Peterson's representation of a crowded Russian invaded plane in Air Force One there maintains a level of high adrenaline soaked entertainment. So with a film revolving around a man threatened at gun point in a telephone box for eighty minutes could Batman and Robin director Joel Schumacher live up to the claustrophobia of the other great thrill rides? What Phone Booth does is take that ideology of guilt and betrayal and put a blackmailing soaked feel of revenge and acceptance on its head and create a bewildering dramatic adventure. When reading descriptions I personally sounded sceptical that this film would not maintain a level of thrilling for over an hour, but somehow it has not only maintained it, but taken the concept of isolation even further.Schumacher's real life shots and exterior portrayals of the location with fast moving hand held cameras help create a feeling of adrenaline and action, with an ounce of drama thrown in to make gripping entertainment.Farrell's character Stu is the subject of a mysterious caller. This apparent assassin blackmails him to stay situated in the booth whilst he manipulates his mind by revealing his own secrets and his powerful knowledge of Stu's own life. Taking on the challenge of acceptance in the wrong and owning up to faults shows how stubborn and proud middle aged men can be and Farrell is in an exceptional position to cease this concept and justify it for the viewers. Sutherland's manipulator is a bizarre creation. Sounding calm and collective we can still feel his anger and be manipulated ourselves, even if his motive is questionable.But the point of Phone Booth is to shock and entertain and though there are some exaggerated drama soap styled concepts thrown in to give the appeal more sustenance, it maintains a gritty realistic portrayal of a sniper situation and significantly, represents that horrible sickly feeling of claustrophobia.",Phone Booth
93,CharltonBoy,Impressive.,8,22 August 2003,This is actually the first film i have seen that Colin Farrel has starred and if this performance is typical of the man then his hype is justified. Phone Booth is a very entertaining film that has a premise that has hardly been used before(the only time i can recall something like this is in Die Hard 3) and that is refreshing to see. 90% of the film is set in a Phone Booth and you would think this would get a bit tedius after a while but this is not the case and if anything the film was not long enough. It's unusual for a feature film to last only 80 odd minutes and perhaps the reason  is that the director thought the audiance would not put up with a longer length of time in one place but in fact the short duration of the film is the film's biggest flaw. Good entertainment. 8 out of 10.,Phone Booth

My favourite film of the year so far and much more entertaining than the blockbusters such as Matrix and X-Men. You actually care about the characters in this film. A request - Please don't do Phone Booth 2",Phone Booth
97,jrarichards,"Not quite as perfect as on the face of it, but still a truly great thriller",9,9 March 2017,"As the name suggests, the action in this film is mostly pared down to one New York street and - basically - to a single phone booth. This is not the way things start out, however, as quite a bit (indeed almost an indulgent amount) of time is first taken allowing us to get to know the ways of the main character: a smooth-talking, relatively small-time but highly ambitious fixer called Stu Shepard (as played by an on-fire Colin Farrell). Being SUPERBLY acted, and entirely plausible-looking, this is a light and surprisingly enjoyable intro-experience that gives little or no clue of what is to follow.But soon enough the film justifies its name as Shepard homes in on the booth and we get to the main story of this 2002 piece by Joel Schumacher. Even at that time, the film was able to acknowledge the rise of the mobile phone, which does also feature, but was clearly still less dominant and life-changing than in 2017. So does ""Phone Booth"" seem hopelessly dated now? Not a bit of it.If one upholds the quaint notion that acting, and the dialogue interaction between actors, matters in a film, well there is just-exquisite and telling interchange to be had here between Shepard - who finds that his power of conversation is all that now stands in the way of his own instant death and that of other innocents, and the hideously sadistic, but also mostly smooth-tongued ""caller"" (Kiefer Sutherland). While engaged in their captivating verbal sparring and duelling, the pair are relatively soon joined (as it were) by Captain Ramey of the NYPD (Forest Whitaker - great as often), whose presence makes it clear to all that this is not really the classic detective story, but much more about the psychological side of things. Is there anything Shepard can do to turn the tables? In a nutshell, the caller has a high-precision weapon and is - literally - ""calling the shots"", playing with Shepard (and to some extent also others) and getting Shepard right where he wants him, taking advantage of high-tech while not eschewing low-tech either. Subtly enough (though as a rather rare commodity in a film), Ramey soon cottons on that something is ""off"" with the whole situation and is determined that nobody else is going to die.As with several other works of this kind, one is entitled to ask if it is mere exploitation to ""force"" the cinemagoer to ""live through"" relatively - or even extremely - contrived situations that probably could not actually happen. The answer to that must relate to the artistic achievement that arises from the device/conceit, and hence revolves around the question: ""Is this a good film or not"".I would say it was actually a great or brilliant one (and I do this despite the fact that the scenario refers to previous cases of the kind, hence the Police ought to have made the connection sooner, and also ought to (would in real life) have deployed a directional microphone, in order to hear precisely what Shepard was saying to his interlocutor, and thus very quickly realise what kind of situation they were dealing with).Such fatal flaws ought to destroy a film's credibility altogether, yet their only impact on me is in fact to reduce the rating I give this film from a 10 to a 9.I guess that speaks for itself...",Phone Booth

The film follows his anxiety of being trapped in this booth and the different things that he does to try to get out. The action of the film literally takes place on the street and around the phone booth where a crowd has gathered. It is everyone's worst nightmare. It's a clever idea, but I do not think it works as a film. The action and events were a cliché, and it was easy to predict what was going to happen. Sometimes, the events were funny when they should have been serious. (They were funny because of the outrageousness of the situation.)

101,raymond-15,Taut tense terrific!,8,9 June 2003,"A very taut production with acting honours going to Colin Farrell who plays the lead role as Stu, a liar and a cheat being forced to examine at the point of a gun every detail of his character and unsavoury lifestyle. Stubborn at first, he finally breaks down into tears and the good side of his character small as it may be begins to shine through.Filmed in a street in New York, the action takes place in and around a public phone booth. Much of the dialogue is in the form of a telephone conversation between Stu and an unknown mysterious but well-informed stranger.Convincing in its detail the film sends a reminder to all of us that we are being watched and our movements monitored by strangers more often than we are probably willing to accept.This is real edge of the seat stuff and will satisfy most thrill seekers. Watch the red spot of the gun sight as it aims at and hovers near the forehead or heart of an innocent victim.Stu probably deserves the fearful gruelling he gets but even so we tend to feel for him in the closing scenes.

As there are other shortcommings: the motive of the killer isn't really clear, the ending is what you always thought it would be (the last scene where Farrell is drugged up is laughably bad) and Kieferson's voice is annoying to say the least. Still it has some things to offer: a nice basic idea, great acting by Farrell and the always good Whitaker, slick camerawork & design.. oh and it's always a plus to have Katie Holmes in your movie :).

105,movieguy1021,Phone Booth: 7/10,7,31 July 2003,"Cell phones are quickly overtaking pay phones as the premiere on-the-run communications device. However, that doesn't stop Joel Schumacher from making a fast-paced 80-minute thriller that takes place inside of a simple phone booth, one of the only ones left in New York. Much like Panic Room in that it takes place in an enclosed space and like Se7en in the motives of `The Caller', Phone Booth almost entirely takes place inside of a phone booth in which Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) enters to make a call to his current fling Pam (Katie Holmes).Stu is a PR man, and he's not exactly the most honorable of all people. He calls Pam from a pay phone because his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) checks his cell phone bill. However, as he's about to leave the booth, it rings and on the other end is a mysterious man, The Caller (Kiefer Sutherland) tells him to stay on the line or else he will shoot Stu with a sniper. Because the MPAA thinks that after national tragedy we can't handle movies that are even somewhat based on the topic, Phone Booth was delayed five months from the Washington, D.C. sniper attacks. Although the hulk of the film is around The Caller, it's also interesting to look at how Stu changes throughout this 80-minute film. It's pretty amazing that we could feel so much for Stu when we don't know much about him, and what we do know was in a brief part of 80 minutes.Not only is Phone Booth an interesting character study, it also is pretty thrilling. There's nothing worse than a feeling of helplessness, and that's what we feel along with Stu. He has to do what the Caller says or else he'll be shot, and he has to do what the police say or else he'll be shot by the police. He has no choices, and has to do what people tell him to do. What makes Phone Booth an interesting ride is how much I liked the Caller. Sure, the movie couldn't work without the police coming into play, but I was just waiting for another scene in the phone booth with the Caller preparing to wreck more havoc. Sutherland was perfect for the role, with his unique voice and his exceptional acting really holding the film together. Farrell, who I liked before he became the subject of tabloids, does a pretty good job.One of the most remarkable parts of the film was its cinematography. Matthew Libatique did an exception job, with varying distance shots and great angles. A few times, when Stu was in the phone booth, it had a rounded shape to it. It's hard to explain but it looked really great. Now, I'm sure you're wondering if I've only said good things about it why I only gave it a 7/10. I hated the ending. I thought that it was just a cheap way to tie everything together. Did anyone not expect it? Also, it wasn't highly thrilling, just mildly. But, if you overlook that, you'll find a big film based on a small idea that really is a small-budget film hiding under the cover of Hollywood.My rating: 7/10Rated R for pervasive language and some violence.",Phone Booth
106,Min111,A thriller movie,6,1 May 2021,"I knew the movie would be good. I'm very much into thriller movies. ""Phone Booth"" is one of these thriller movie. What I liked the most regarding the movie is that it ran for a short time. The main character is a man named Stu who you'll dislike. He's an arrogant man. He uses a phone booth to contact someone (Pam) which he'll soon regret. He finds his life under threat when he answers a ringing phone at a phone booth. The caller tells him that he will be shot the minute he cuts the call. The caller apparently knows who Stu is, but Stu doesn't know who's calling him. The caller threatens to tell Stu's wife (Kelly) that he has been dating someone. The caller warns him not to leave the phone booth. I really liked the part where some prostitutes demand to use the phone. I didn't like them since it was actually Stu's right to use the phone booth. Stu was there first. Those prostitutes were pretty annoying, and it appears they were trying to create a scene. I liked how the caller shoots this violent man, and those silly prostitutes blame Stu, and accuse him of having a gun. The movie gets very interesting as soon as the police arrive. I really liked the police named Ed where he negotiates with Stu in a acceptable manner. The police do eventually trace the call to a nearby building. The caller, though, is the most interesting character in the movie. We don't know anything about him other than he's a skilled sniper. We don't even know why he's doing this to Stu, but we do learn that the caller did something similar to others. I really wanted the caller captured. He didn't had to get away.

He will kill people so they behave morally. Then we get a scene zooming out into space, satellite, and then a phone call, another phone booth. Maybe waiting for a sequel.Here's a suggestion. Write something intelligent. Intelligent! I know there is intelligence out there. Write it. Then produce it into a film. Not some half baked nonsense.I give this 3 stars for Colin Farrell's performance. The writing failed. All the other actors here were crap. Forest Whitaker is crap.

Still the film does keep your attention and works fairly well due to the energetic performance of Farrell.. who doesnt bore you as he occupies pretty darn near every frame of the film.

I was wrong, as he was able to produce not a decent thriller, but a fantastic thriller. Restricting the film down to a single phone booth was a wonderful concept and everyone was able to make it work. Colin Farrell was able to provide a convincing performance and the voice on the phone was just so eerie. Add to that, the wonderful Forest Whitaker and you have yourself a successful thriller which really does make you think. A word of advice though.

There's almost no substance at all, and they're populated by characters we care little about.After the disastrous fiasco of Batman & Robin, Schumacher was forced to turn away from the big budget extravaganzas that were his trademark. Instead he had to make films that were stripped back to their essentials. And in the case of Phone Booth, this minimalist film is actually quite a decent effort. Being a Schumacher film it has flaws, but for once, he doesn't allow his trademark theatrics to swamp the story. He relies on solid acting instead, and draws out a considerable amount of strength in the process.Phone Booth is built upon a very simple premise. A man walks into a phone box, and is contacted by an anonymous caller. This man can't leave the box because the caller has a sniper rifle aimed at him from any one of the windows surrounding the phone box.Its quite a slim idea. But wisely Phone Booth has got a very lean running time. Only 80 minutes. And its a good thing the film is so short. Because otherwise the situation would soon grow to be very tedious. The fact it doesn't shows that for once, Joel Schumacher's direction is right on the money. He keeps things brisk, accessible, and very very edgy.Colin Farrell plays Stu Shepard, the arrogant NY publicist who remains trapped within the walls of the phone booth for the duration of the film.Kiefer Sutherland plays the Caller. We never find out his name. And we don't see him until the very end. But Sutherland's voice is enough to make the Caller a character in the story.A failing of Joel Schumacher is that he usually gets distracted by visual flair and gloss. But because the screenplay by Larry Cohen requires the film's surroundings to be that of a phone box on a city street, it means Schumacher has no choice but to restrain his flamboyant tendencies, and allow the strength of the acting and writing to be the hook to hang the story on.Colin Farrell is at the centre of it. And although I'm not a huge fan of the man, he turns in a nicely modulated performance. The way he goes from a slick, superficial snake to a crumbling, gibbering wreck is quite absorbing. And the way Schumacher slowly brings Stu to his knees over the course of 80 minutes is generally astute and reasonably assured.Kiefer Sutherland has a much trickier part to play. Because he's only heard, and not seen, he has to rely on the power of his voice alone to make him a threatening presence. And Sutherland has a great deal of fun in the part. Taunting Stu. Misdirecting him. Bluffing him. He gets one of his best roles in years.But despite the fact that Phone Booth is very economical and slick, if you look hard enough, the film has some glaring faults. They probably won't occur to you until after the film has wrapped, but they are there. For one, the motivations behind the Caller's actions seem slight. He claims he does this kind of thing to people who really deserve it. Which seems a tad simplistic to me. Stu is picked on generally because he's not a nice person, and because he's having an affair with one of his clients, the insipidly blank Katie Holmes.It means that Phone Booth is a little empty on the surface. And I blame that on Schumacher. A lot of the characters in his films are little more than blank surfaces. Its a testament to Farrell and Sutherland's acting that they convince you as much as they do.And the ending is something that's been ripped off from about a dozen other hostage thrillers. That's not too unexpected since Schumacher's limitations as a filmmaker means he often steals other directors ideas to compensate.Still, for any failings the film might have, Phone Booth is a largely successful endeavour. Its not quite the insightful analysis of the human condition that it likes to think it is. But it does what it sets out to do. It entertains, unnerves and occasionally shocks. Qualities not often found in Joel Schumacher's work.",Phone Booth

118,EthanBJones_03,"A fantastic and tense and nigh perfect thriller which should be more recognised,",9,4 March 2017,"Directed by Joel SchumacherStarring Colin Farell, Kiefer Sutherland and Forrest WhitakerOverall: This is one of my favourite thrillers of all time and it is just an incredible movie which doesn't get the amount of attention it deserves.Good: 1. Colin Farell does a great job as Stu Shephard as does Forrest Whitaker as Captain Ramey.2. The true star of this movie, however, is Kiefer Sutherland as the mysterious caller who, even with very limited screen time, gave a chilling performance and was truly admirable to do so much with just one's voice.3. The actual story itself was fantastic and I loved every single second of it.4. The idea is simple: One man in a phonebooth being harassed by a sniper. So simple yet so genius and incredible simultaneously. It proves that a movie doesn't need to be 'Inception' levels of complex, to be great.5. Perfect ending which couldn't have been done any better.6. I like the cinematography. It's simple and focuses on the phonebooth. It doesn't overachieve which is perfect for the movie.7. The sheer isolation of the movie is very claustrophobic and is such a perfect choice which places you in the shoes of the lead character.8. I love how 'Who the villain is' is open to interpretation. Personally, I see the Sniper's targets to be the villains and him the good guy. Think about it, he kills a Paedophile, corrupt business man, pimp and then threatens a man cheating on his wife. The caller's not a saint and is still technically a criminal but he is closer to the good guy than Stu is.Bad:1. His wife and mistress felt more like plot points than characters and their acting was pretty poor also. 2. His protégé kind of just showed up and left whenever he was needed. This could have been tweaked.9/10",Phone Booth
119,christian123,An Intense and Enjoyable Thriller,7,21 May 2005,"Phone Booth is a thrilling and exciting film to watch that will make you scared. Stu Shepard, a low-rent media consultant who is trapped after being told by a caller - a serial killer with a sniper rifle - that he'll be shot dead if he hangs up. They believe that Stu, not the unseen caller of whom they remain unaware, is the dangerous man with a gun. The senior officer on the scene, Captain Ramey, tries to talk Stu out of the booth. But uncanonized to Ramey, his team, the media circus that has flocked to the site - and Stu's wife, Kelly, and his client /prospective girlfriend, Pamela - the caller has them all in his high-powered rifle sights. Stu must dig deep into his soul, find his strength and attempt to outwit the caller, taking the game to an even more dangerous level. The plot is similar to Liberty Stands Still and Panic Room but the execution it done pretty well. The majority of the film takes place in and around a phone booth. While that may not sound exciting, it actually is a pretty good film. There are plenty of intense scenes and the acting is also pretty good. Colin Farrell is a pretty good actor and he does a good job in this film. Forest Whitaker plays Captain Ramey and he also does a good job. Kiefer Sutherland is actually not seen until the end but he has a good creepy phone voice. Joel Schumacher does a pretty good job of directing and makes up for making the horrible Bad Company. The running time is just 80 minutes long so its not boring to watch. As soon as he picks up the phone it's a fun ride until the end. The films plot is unrealistic though as no one would actually be able to do this and get away. Also you don't really feel for the character so it may be hard to actually care about the film. The movie is also kind of predictable but the director and the cast make it exciting to sit through. In the end, this a nice, short thriller to watch. Rating 7.7/10, defiantly worth checking out.",Phone Booth

121,LivingDog,Utterly BRILLIANT performance by Colin Farrell,9,3 March 2004,"Colin Farrell is unbelievable and undeniably the best actor of our age - I would dare suggest that he is even better than Sir Laurence Olivier. I've seen Mr. Farrell in several movies now and am utterly sold on his solid rock-bottom palpable talent. He and Jason Statham are two giant talents that sell a movie for me. (You *must* see Jason in ""SNATCH."")I have seen Mr. Farrell on a public TV show where actors sit down and discuss their industry. Mr. Farrell is Irish, with a *THICK* Irish accent. His singular ability to put his accent down and speak equally well in a New York/American accent is profound - and that's to mention the least of his talents. During his discussion at this ""round table"" his ability to toss out several vulgarities in one sentence was evident. I dare say he would embarrass a sailor with his special tongue. However, his ability to utterly succumb to the character that he is playing has put him above all the actors currently considered Hollywood's best. (Three come to mind: Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, and Johnny Depp.) Mr. Farrell has raised the bar and I personally don't think they can reach it. Mr. Farrell is in a class *BY HIMSELF*!Mr. Farrell is currently making ""Alexander"" (the Great). I might even see this movie in the theater - a good one - one in Manhattan... and I do not like the city anymore [""Mmmm, I love the City in the summer, it smells like a urinal."" -Billy Crystal on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show (approximately 1 million years ago :)], nor have I been in a theater in ~8 years.Ok, now here's the funny part - I was going to avoid this ""what-a-stupid-idea-for-a-plot-...-a-man-in-a-phone-booth"" movie. Nothing was on cable (as is usual nowadays) and so I tuned this in. First you see Colin Farrell's character wheeling and dealing on 3 cell phones. Immediately you are impressed with the rhythm. From there it all goes uphill!

After watching the movie, it became clear that you can't. Or at least you can't and keep the interest of the audience.This is the story of a man who learns from the fear inflicted upon him by a gunman who makes him admit to his failures as a person or face death.  In order to keep the movie going for a sufficient length of time, the plot starts to feel more and more contrived.  I felt there are considerably more reasonable paths that the movie should have taken, albeit ones with less drama.It is not a terrible movie by a long shot, and in fact, could have been an interesting 50 minute short film.  The acting seemed to be well done.  In all, not bad, but I don't quite understand the high 7.5 IMDB rating.",Phone Booth
127,Silverzero,"Cerebral, high concept thriller plays well on the big screen.",7,29 August 2003,"Intriguing concept isn't it. A film that takes place entirely in a phone booth in which a man will be assassinated if he leaves the area. And then the police attempt to negotiate when he is thought to have shot someone. From the start, you can tell that this will be a good movie. The concept in itself is worthy of 80 minutes of your time. The movie gets all of its power from the long high-octane thrill, which carries on from start to finish in a deadly one act. The premise never wears thin and ends just at the right moment. It is very strange that instead of being a small-scale A grade flick, this is a large-scale summer blockbuster. And that is one of the films downfalls. Schumacher completely overplays the effect, which bogs down, what should have been, plot subtlety.I'm not saying that `Phone Booth' was bad. I'm just saying that it had the potential to be IMDb Top 250 material as a landmark in cinema history. But too often does Schumacher rely on 'outsider' help. The creation of modern era New York is perfectly realistic, but did this really need a narrator? This isn't helped by fast edits, split screens and flashbacks, which do nothing but lessen the effect. It must have been very easy to make. It might have been slightly better had they done the entire movie in one take and perhaps degraded the shots to make them look slightly less Hollywood like.
The small details are occasionally impressive, but others are un-necessary. Case in point is the fact that they fiddled with the 20th Century Fox logo at the beginning. This was a neat idea when directors first started doing so, but here it just seems pointless. And they gave the opening a glossy `Broadway musical' style Barbershop score. But they have a dazzling `zoom in' on New York City. The outcome is accelerated by a shock ending which is followed by yet another shock ending which de-shocks that which we thought was true. That sounds confusing, but watch the film and you'll understand.
Colin `I've been in a million movies this year' Farrell quite frankly overdoes the `look at me! I'm an asshole' act in the opening moments but once he's in the booth, the performance kicks in. They should really have an Academy Award for `Best Voice'. If they did, Keifer Sutherland would be a shoe-in, as the menacing, antagonistic vocals are right on target. It's just too bad they made the inexcusable mishap of putting him on the front cover, as it answers the question of `Will he show up or not?'. Supporting turns are good from Radha Mitchell, Forest Whitaker and Katie Holmes.
Of course then there's all the symbolic, philosophical hokum that just doesn't work. Schumacher shouldn't have tried it out in the first place. You've probably noticed that most of what I've done in this review is complain about the picture, yet I still claim to like it. `Phone Booth' is great high-octane, thrilling fodder, but it had the potential to be a classic.

Yes, what you know is right. But what you think is not right. You can never presume what's waiting for you. Go watch the movie... and in the end you'll come up with an experience that an average Joe Moviegoer is less likely to have.The reason behind I praise this so much is simply that it creates a tension all throughout with just a conversation. No scene change, no location change, no chase sequence, no creepy or gory scenes, no dark thrill... and definitely not an usual eye candy. Yet, it is the one of the most stylish thrillers I've ever seen. Thanks to superb cinematography and director Joel Schumacher. The cult beginning is one of its plus points too. The screenplay contains too much f-words, yet it is the heart and soul of the movie. I liked it very much, with that chilling voice of Keifer Sutherland.Man of the moment Colin Farrell is always nice to watch. He has his special style in full bloom in the first part of the movie. Yet he becomes quite able to portray the rapid change in Stuart's character throughout. I think it is his best work since Tigerland.

Almost every flick now is two hours and too long. But at only 80 minutes, ""Phone Booth"" managed to have all the excitement, emotions, and humour it needed. The screenplay, by Larry Cohen, shows the confidence of a writer who knows he has a terrific starting point and plans to squeeze out every last drop of inspiration.

137,higherall7,When Death is talking on the other end...,8,12 December 2014,"'Phone Booth' is essentially one-act play turned into a movie. Alfred Hitchcock would have licked his chops over this script written by Larry Cohen and the two to three line pitch must have been one of the easiest to sell to Studio Executives of all time. Those of you who have a background in Theater and Playwrighting as I do, I would urge to study this film as it is a primer and a clinic in how to move a drama from the stage to the film lot.Despite the sweeping and suspenseful visual effects supplied by Cinematographer Matthew Libatique, this is a film driven more by dialog than by anything visual. There is the sleazy publicist played by Colin Farrell; walking the streets of New York and making deals on his cell phone in that '-let's do lunch-' manner we have come to associate with his ilk. There is Radha Mitchell as his wife and Katie Holmes as his 'something-something' on the side, filling in the Madonna- Whore complex which seems to be such a fixation and obsession with Western Man. Finally, there is Kiefer Sutherland as the mysterious sniper from on high who turns the phone booth where Farrell's character arranges his lover's trysts with Holmes into a confessional.Now you're good to go. If you are a fan of simplicity as I am, I do not have to intone Scott Meredith to you and his rule for effective storytelling. Farrell's character Stu enters a phone booth and thereafter finds himself in a pickle as whores and a pimp and cops orbit around him and wonder what's taking so long for him to finish his call and why he won't even come out for a cigarette.I remember lines of dialog more than anything else. That is why I am interested in how this would have played out on the stage. It's even more a character driven drama and all the characters are very vivid in my mind. Stu becomes the main character in a Street Theater performance where he is advised to come clean under threat of death and the constant staccato racking of a high powered rifle. The tension and suspense are skillfully accelerated by Director Joel Schumacher and before you know it, you have arrived at the climatic scene where Stu is literally holding his life in his hands before being advised to go and sin no more.",Phone Booth
138,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,the thriller that started it all for me,9,25 February 2006,"After I first watched Phone Booth (I'm a younger guy), I was so impressed with the thriller genre so much that I went back and watched the thriller classics and the thrillers that have come out since. Phone Booth was probably the first movie that I truly wanted to watch in my life, and I got my wish, and it did not disappoint.Phone Booth stars Colin Farrell, who gives a remarkable performance in his first shot at a lead role. A lot of people have knocked Farrell in the past for his wisecracking roles in Minority Report and S.W.A.T., but this is Farrell's best performance. Farrell plays Stu Shepard, a New York publicist who is living a life of lies and deceit, promising clients big things, yet he is unable to follow through on those promises (we glance Ben Foster in the beginning as one of Stu's clients). Stu is also leading a young and beautiful actress (Katie Holmes; Batman Begins, Dawson's Creek) down this deceitful path, hoping she'll sleep with him, forcing an affair with his wife (Radha Mitchell; Melinda & Melinda, Silent Hill).Just when it's getting nice for Stu and his assistant, Adam (Keith Nobbs; Double Whammy), Stu decides to use a phone booth to call Pam (Katie Holmes), since his wife checks his cell phone's calls. After a probably amusing scene involving a pizza man, Stu hears the phone ringing, and he answers it. It is a man, who is simply known as The Caller. Over time, The Caller explains his intentions: Stu must confess that his entire life is a lie, or die. Well, Stu, being the arrogant man he is, blows the guy off. After a showdown with a few prostitute strippers and a pimp, Stu realizes that The Caller is not kidding. From this point on, he is held hostage in his phone booth by The Caller, who could be anywhere....The police arrive, and it's here we see the only person that may be able to save Stu, the police Leutinent (Forest Whitaker; The Shield).Phone Booth takes place in real time, one of the few movies that actually does that well. The Caller's voice is just menacing and evil, and it comes as no surprise that he is Kiefer Sutherland, who has one of the scariest voices I've ever heard when angry. Sutherland is incredible in this movie, because you'll be scared of him without seeing him. He is in total control of Stu throughout the film. Forest Whitaker does well as Stu's negotiator, being a likable character that you also hate when you first meet him. Katie Holmes and Radha Mitchell don't really have a ton of lines, but each performs well, but Mitchell is better. She is the more important character, and her lines are delivered with passion, worry, and emotion every time. Finally, Colin Farrell's Stu Shepard is a phenomenal character, so well-rounded, so mysterious, yet so likable. Stu is a good person, but he's just made some not so good choices, which The Caller exploits.Joel Schumacher filmed Phone Booth in 12 days (10 days of the booth, 2 of other surroundings and other scenes), yet this does not deteriorate the film in any way. I was just ready to trust him after the disasters known as Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, and he delivered a powerful thriller that you'll watch time and time again, and it never gets boring...Have fun...9/10 --spy",Phone Booth
139,Jerique,Chilling and Thrilling!,8,10 April 2010,"From the get-go, Phone Booth pulls you into it's claustrophobic booth of thrilling drama that chills you to the bone. Kiefer Sutherland gives an outstanding performance as The Caller and is unrecognizable until you see his name on screen. Overshadowed by Kiefer is Colin Farrell in the shoes of the audience and his acting is so brilliant that your heart races along with his every second. Underneath the two leads comes an underrated actor in Forest Whitaker (who is such an amazing actor in too many roles to name), as the Captain of NYPD.In a movie of this nature, one set can make the audience feel claustrophobic and closed in. That's exactly what you're supposed to feel and you're supposed to feel like Stu Sheppard -trapped in a Phone Booth in a ride for his life. It's a cheap tactic for making a movie low budget, but the writers and actors were able to go beyond B-movie material and make it memorable and worth while.It's also not your run-of-the-mill ""Hollywood"" happy ending. To a more modern day audience this film will remind many people of ""Saw"" (2004) and The Caller has the likes of ""Jigsaw"". Speaking of audiences, it's got some offensive material and language and some disturbing violence. I would keep this film away from anyone under 14.It's a great film on many levels, but just a small lack of realism takes away from it's ability to be a perfect ten, as well, it's got nearly zero comic relief and is very tense and stiff from the first five minutes and really doesn't let up from there till the last frame. It's a mature film and intended for mature audiences.",Phone Booth
140,fimimix,..things in small packages are very entertaining..,10,5 June 2008,"""Phone Booth"" kept me captive as much as it did Colin Farrell (""Stu Shephard""). No matter what other big stars held this movie up, Farrell was the right guy - I sincerely hope it makes a bundle, no matter how it is released. I saw a trailer SOMEPLACE, and knew that I'd enjoy......lucky me, a friend had it.I guess some folk don't like Joel Schumacher's directing: I'm not overly acquainted with his style, but this film put him high on my enjoyment-list. A lot of today's generation may never have seen this type of phone-booth - wonder what happened to all of them when they went out of use ? What a revel they were ! Those tacky phones hanging on the wall are hardly worth the $.75 required to use them. Try to get someone to call you back, and you'll discover there are VERY FEW incoming calls.Writer Larry Cohen has a very good imagination, and knows how to get it onto paper. How frustrating it must have been for him to see it sit on ""the shelf"", after the short time it took to get it onto film. But, no doubt he had already pocketed his money. Hope his residuals are huge.Keifer Sutherland (""The Caller"") certainly holds your attention, even when he goes-off into his sick childhood. His voice was riveting; I wish I had surround-sound now so I could listen to the effect. I've watched this film 3 times in a week.Forest Whitaker (""Capt. Ramey"") was perfect for his role - some users thought it took him a while to get-onto why ""Stu"" was trapped in the booth. Me, I think he caught-on right away, or else he'd had ordered his cops to shoot and that would have been the end of ""Stu"". The simple reason of this particular phone-booth was right in the middle of New York City is another anachronism......but, gave the hookers (and other creeps) the right place to make their money. This is kind of incident that old-timers in NYC just ignore and hope it doesn't involve them. N ONE mentioned the first object to be shot - the toys.....Radha Mitchell (""Kelly Shepard"") and Kate Holmes (""Pam"") were excellent in their roles. That ""Kelly"" kept track of ""Stu's"" cell-phone calls is another example of how public everything is today, and reminds me of all the gimmickry in ""Enemy of the State"".Farrell was superb in his role. Other users have commented he used every gimmick in his closet, and they are right. If he isn't a huge star, by now, there's something wrong. I can't think of any big star who could have portrayed the role better; a somewhat unknown actor for this kind of role is often refreshing and just what the producers needed. The location/sets were perfect for this genre; quick camera-works kept the plot screeching to the very end. You won't leave the TV for this film - it deserves a much bigger release. BUT, it's not always a mistake to release ""direct to video"". I give it a 20 -",Phone Booth
141,theinaniloquent,"""Your life is on the line""",5,9 May 2012,"Well, I can't really get into much detail, as there isn't going to be much going on. Joel Schumacher is a really bad director in my opinion, albeit a few decent films. When I first heard of this one, I passed it off as just another wanna-be thriller that contains no substance or depth. And the overall film itself looked exactly like a Joel Schumacher film, so that's that.. But you know that feeling you get, where your vulnerable and find yourself wanting to watch anything to at least give you *some* entertainment? This was me, three days ago. I wanted to watch something that would provide a twist, even if it came across cliché or stupid. I was the complete antonym of relentlessness..So I watched it. Can't say I didn't hated it.. But can't say I liked it either...Phone Booth was that kind of film I wanted to get into. Cheap thrills and some comedic moments as well. The acting was cheap and wooden at times, but I was surprised to find that Collin Ferrell's performance wasn't too bad, especially in the scenes where he follows the man beyond the phone. The plot was new, hasn't been done before. But that gives it no reason to be clichéd as points, and also a bit stupid. (the whole hooker part, really?) And the twist? Really? It wasn't expecting that overall ""shock factor"" that some classics give to you, but Phone Booth seemed to be lazy in it's writing. It just seemed a little silly, and also a bit cliché. The man behind the phone wasn't that guy, it was this guy. Fade to black; credits roll. Haven't seen that before. And although I keep bashing it like I mean it, it isn't the worse film of all time. It was entertaining and fast-paced, but should be no way with a high point average such as 7.1! I recommend for the vulnerable feeling I was feeling. If there isn't any other movies to watch, and you're dying to pure boredom, I was suggest watching this; as it provides for your feelings. But the whole film as a whole? As an art? One word: forgettable..5/10.",Phone Booth
142,Shiva-11,One ringy dingy.,7,5 April 2003,"Anyone who doubts that people are as easily programmable as Pavlov's pets need look no further Graham Bell's little box.  While most of us generally don't start salivating at the sound of a ringing phone, few people (unless they work for a software help desk) can resist the urge to answer one. Pray that the darkest force that dials your number is a telemarketer.
For Stu Shephard, sincerity is little more than a fuzzy concept. A shady publicist, his life consists of spinning interconnecting webs of lies to further the careers of clients and raise his stature. In his spare time he enjoys abusing his assistant, and ignoring his wife. Stu is, is also determined to give an impressionable young actress a test run on the casting couch. When he enters the one functioning pay phone in a ten-block radius in the hopes of setting up a liaison, the phone rings. It turns out to be Stu's conscience on the line.  With a sniper rifle aimed at Stu's head.When you take into account that `Phone Booth' was filmed in just ten days, on a limited budget with a dearth of special effects, one principle actor and a single venue you could be forgiven for questioning the potential success of this film. The original November 2001 release date might give one pause - films that sit on the shelf usually do so for a reason - read `straight to video'. In this instance the studio wanted to wait until Farrell was more familiar to moviegoers. He achieved this with a little film called `Minority Report' (the name of his co-star escapes me at the moment...). `Phone Booth's' new release date had to be pushed back once again after the sniping episodes in Washington. Some things are worth the wait.While he stole the spotlight as the maniacal hit man in `Daredevil', Farrell is faced with a different animal in `Phone Booth', an 80-minute soliloquy which lives or dies on his performance (several A-list stars walked away from the project for this very reason).  Reminiscent of his much-lauded turn in `Tigerland', Farrell confirms that he isn't a one trick pony, proffering a wide-ranging display of emotions, from cocky to cathartic without straying into soap opera or comic territory.  He delivers his lines with a solid fluidity rare among his peers, no simple feat when one takes into account that he's suppressing a harsh brogue. Farrell also demonstrates a presence, beyond mere charisma - his good looks can only inspire interest for so long - that draw the viewer into the story.While the supporting cast - Katie Holmes as the naive ingenue and Forrest Whitaker as the good cop - fulfill their purpose, it is Keifer Sutherland who takes up what little slack there is. While the audience doesn't get to see Sutherland, he is amply menacing as the cold, otherworldly voice on the other end of the phone. The audience is never privy to who he is (`Just call me Bob') or what his motives are, but it is inconsequential - he sees all, knows all, and is clearly in charge.  Unlike S&M, there are no safe words. And for a control freak like Stu nothing could be more terrifying.Although tied to a static location, deft camera work provides action, perspective and mood with such techniques as quick pans, compressed zooming, and picture in picture sequences, while careful not to cross the gimmickry line . Enhanced sound editing bolsters the visuals: ringing phones are jarring, Bob's quietly booming voice is unsettling, and the sound of a round being chambered is deafening.`Phone Booth' could easily have been a quirky novelty flick that played well amongst the art house set. Thanks to Farrell's performance it makes for good mainstream cinema (normally an oxymoron) and may actually make a few top ten lists.",Phone Booth
143,Scott_Mercer,"Low Budget, High Quality",9,16 December 2007,"A highly entertaining little psychological thriller.True, the gimmick is what got me interested: a entire movie that takes place in a phone booth. That's a slight exaggeration, but that's the premise that got cult film writer/director Larry Cohen to write this screenplay over 30 years ago, and he reportedly pitched it to Alfred Hitchcock shortly before the Great Man's passing.Since it was first laid to paper, the script had to have a lot of rewrites. In fact, technology almost made this script obsolete. We are told that this phone booth where the film unfolds (of a type first installed in the 1950's) is the last of its type in Manhattan (as of when the film was made, 2002), and is scheduled to be demolished. I wish this film had actually been made in the 1970's, in a world without cell phones. That would have amped up the tension, in my view. But, they managed to do some rewriting and push that problem to the side.It's Cohen's taut writing that is the real motivator here, coupled with searing acting by Collin Ferrell and Forest Whitaker. Radha Mitchell and Katie Holmes don't have much to do. Kiefer Sutherland is perfectly menacing yet not without some layer of rationality, but unfortunately we only hear him for most of the film. Joel Schumaker's direction is fine, but not nearly as remarkable as the writing and acting.For a film shot in 10 days (with 2 days of pickups) for 2 million bucks, the studio got quite a lot of entertainment value for its money. I hope it turned a profit, but with a budget that low the odds are probably good that it did.Well worth your time. No sex, but there is violence, death and plenty of ""naughty words."" Highly recommended.Now, sequel anyone?",Phone Booth

145,springsunnywinter,One of my most favourite films,10,21 June 2007,"At first I thought the film was going to be just a normal thriller but it turned out to be a thousand times better than I expected. The film is truly original and was so dark & sinister that gives the tensive mood also it is emotionally & psychologically thrilling, the whole movie is charged with pulse pounding suspense and seems like it's really happening. It's amazing that how they managed to make an 80 minute movie with just a guy in a phone booth but the full credit goes to Colin Farrell and Larry Cohen the writer not Joel Schumacher because he is a crappy director. Joel Schumacher's films are rubbish especially The Number 23, Phone Booth was shot in 10 days with a budget of $10 million so it wasn't a hard job to make it, that's why Joel doesn't get any credit but the cast & crew did a fantastic job. I also really liked the raspberry coloured shirt Colin was wearing and it was an excellent choice of clothing because the viewers are going to watch him throughout the whole film. When I first saw the movie I fell in love with it and I bought it on DVD the next day and I've seen it about 20 times and I'm still not fed up with it. Phone Booth is and always will be Colin Farrell's best film! Overall it is simply one of my favourite films and I even argued over my friend because he didn't like it.",Phone Booth

The clichés don't stop there but at least the script isn't completely oblivious to its own absurd nature.

147,David_Frames,"""Can I call you back?""",7,20 April 2003,"Phone Booth is the movie that exposes the BT advertising of years ago that told us it was 'good to talk' as a cruel lie as Colin Farrell uses a public phone to call a girl he has designs on so it won't show up on his mobile bill and alert his suspicious wife. Sadly, Kiefer rings him on the same number and is one of those irritating people who just talks and talks and loves the sound of own voice. Hes got so much to say in fact that he'll kill Farrell if he hangs up. Anyone who's had a conversation with my mother will know how he feels. From then on this minimalist thriller grabs the attention and holds it until the end, due in no small part to Farrell's believable turn as the shallow pr guru who realises over the course of his 90 minute chat that he needs to take stock of his life, buy a new mobile phone and be a better person should he survive. Director JS (as hes known to no-one)uses split screens to open the field of view a little and as the psycho on the other end of the line, Sutherland is suitably menacing. If Phone Booth drops the ball toward the end with a hurried and somewhat anti-climatic last 5 minutes then its still worth watching if only to see Katie Holmes as Farrell's would be bit on the side and imagine her naked in 'The Gift'all over again. If Farrell had the guts to have reversed the charges this would be a 10, as it is i'm calling in a 7.",Phone Booth
148,ilovedolby,"`Phone Booth' is that it is tense, taut, and terrific!!!",9,4 April 2003,"Director Joel Schumacher brings us the long awaited `Phone Booth,' which stars Colin Farrell, the ever-growing celebrity of such films as `Minority Report,' and `The Recruit.' This film's release was delayed, at least to my knowledge, at least two times. It was last scheduled for release on November 15, 2002. But once again, due to Hollywood's new campaign of sensitivity' in the wake of 9/11, the release was held back until now. Allow me to begin my review of `Phone Booth' with the following-it was worth the wait! This movie was great. I have to admit that I was concerned that it would be over the top, and perhaps be too sensationalized to feel realistic. On the contrary, `Phone Booth' is filled with nail-biting suspense that will leave the audience on the edge of their seats. 	The premise follows that of Stuart Sheppard (Farrell), a publicist with a penchant for dressing in Italian suits, lying to his wife, employees and the people that he's trying to turn into icons. However, on a particular day in busy New York City, he heads to a phone booth to call his girlfriend, who doesn't realize that he's married. After he hangs up the phone, it rings and he picks up. On the line is an anonymous person who knows every little detail about Stu's life and wants to make him pay for the lies that he lives. The plot unfolds and the truth about Stu's life is about to be told, in a way he could never have imagined. 	I was so impressed with the suspense that this film incorporated. Farrell is great in this role, as he is in almost anything he does-the Irish born actor just has raw talent. He has worked with director Schumacher before on the Vietnam War flick, `Tigerland.' Despite the fact that `Phone Booth' was originally scheduled for release in 2002, it's actual release now in 2003 makes it the third film that Farrell has appeared in this year-and it's only April. Besides playing opposite Al Pacino in `The Recruit,' Farrell plays the psychotic hit man, Bullseye in `Daredevil.' Look for him in three other films due out later this year: `Veronica Guerin,' S.W.A.T.,' and `Intermission.' 	Kiefer Sutherland provides the haunting voice of the man on the other end of the line. Sutherland is a great actor and is often cast as the bad guy. He can be seen in the hit Fox TV show, `24.' He, like Farrell, has also worked with Schumacher on another film, `A Time To Kill,' opposite Matthew McConaughey. Sutherland's role in `Phone Booth' reminded me of Gary Sinise's role in the 1996 thriller, `Ransom,' which starred Mel Gibson and was directed by Ron Howard, in which Sinise played a man obsessed with putting the rich guy in his place. 	`Phone Booth' also holds the great talents of Forest Whitaker, who was last seen in `Panic Room.' Whitaker portrays an N.Y.P.D. captain by the name of Ramey. Radha Mitchell (`Pitch Black') plays Stu's wife, Kelly. `Dawson's Creek' star, Katie Holmes, plays Stu's young girlfriend, Pam.	`Phone Booth' isn't entirely original, but damn, is it good! My heart was pounding at various points in the film in which the tension in the theater could be cut with a knife. The bottom line with `Phone Booth' is that it is tense, taut, and terrific. ***",Phone Booth

Now of course what happens in between are both fascinating and frustrating. This is the type of movie that puts the viewer into the situation and asks ""what would you do?"" Farrell plays Stu Shepard, and ad executive who is married (wife is played by Radha Mitchell) but has a long term fling with a younger woman (Katie Holmes). A man who we don't see takes the fact that Stu is a me-me-me guy personally, calling a pay phone that Stu answers one day and holds him hostage there. The caller is played (voiced is perhaps a better way to explain what he does) by Sutherland as the omnipresent voice from above, showing himself only by way of clues left in the phone booth or by the people he shoots. Forest Whitaker plays the police chief who is trying to piece together what exactly is going on. The movie is very quick, shorter than most animated movies, and had it's theatrical release delayed for months because of the DC sniper shootings in 2002. The primary feeling I had was frustration, especially after thinking about what I would do. I thought to myself often ""Why not do that? Oh yeah, I can't because of (fill in the blank).""

Everyone is gushing about how incredibly well they did by shooting the movie in 10 days (don't independent film makers do this regularly?), and we get to see just how incredible Farrell's performance is before they spoiled it in the edit, and made certain lines seem extremely hammy.The take they show of Farrell confessing all for example is much more powerful without all the cheesy close ups. That scene seems so amazing when you see it raw in the 'making of', that I wonder why they didn't keep it that way. Farrell deservedly gets an ovation after his lengthy deliveryThis movie reminds me a little of 'Dog Day Afternoon', only the way that movie was shot and put together seemed a lot more authentic.

So I sat down to watch it, challenging it to amaze me, thinking it wasn't possible for this movie to be any good. Well, it is. It isn't amazing, per se, but it's a lot better than I feared it would be. Phone Booth actually does manage to keep the viewer interested for a solid 90 minutes, even though the characters might be a bit wooden and stock-like. The suspense is good and the dialogue is good too. My only real problem with this is that it's a bit too short and blunt, trying to be this dark psychological thriller, but only half succeeding. It doesn't go far enough into depth with the characters to really make any big statements about humankind, do anything new or blow anybody away.

The premise of this film is a slick media consultant in New York City finds himself trapped in a phone booth by an extortionist's sniper rifle; seems fairly straightforward. However, it is the enthralling story, superb acting and exceptional camera work that give the viewer an intense, worthwhile experience. This is seriously entertainment at its best.Farrell gives a fantastically convincing performance as a sleazy, New York publicist who bears some semblance to a young Ari Gold. I have always found that this man is painfully underrated and this film really shows off his versatility in a complete starring role. Everything from the thick New York accent to the devolution of his character seemed very natural and perfectly delivered. Kiefer Sutherland, providing the voice of the sniper, delivers a daunting performance. With merely his voice, he displays an intelligent, darkly comical and foreboding presence that makes the movie work. Forest Whitaker also gives a standout performance in his supporting role as captain of the task force.Joel Schumacher uses smart camera techniques, whether it being the use of split screens or fast cuts, to cultivate an atmosphere of sheer intensity and anticipation. It can be difficult to string along a story which takes place in mostly one setting, but the pace seems to never let up from start to finish. The director, editors and anyone else involved in the visual cutting of this film deserve a lot of praise. Phone Booth is creative, entertaining and ultra suspenseful.

156,Pavel-8,High Quality Popcorn Flick.,7,12 April 2003,"**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**The premise is simple.  Man answers phone; will be shot if he hangs up.  But telling a story from that premise is much trickier.  Countless omissions or flaws could have easily dragged down this movie, but the script covers all the outs.  Some of them take longer to get to (one in particular came late in the second act and added another dimension to the tale), but the small twists and turns fit nicely into the flow and pacing of the story. 
The acting in ""Phone Booth"" is solid; the entire cast provides exactly what is needed.  Colin Farrell is very good as the slick-talking publicist, and his transformation throughout the film is both believable and effective without going over the top.  An impressive job considering he was probably on screen 80% of the movie.  Kiefer Sutherland's almost gravelly voice is perfect for his nearly invisible role as the sniper.  Forest Whitaker provides another good performance (""Panic Room"") as a flawed and sympathetic gentle giant.  Everyone else fits in dutifully.  The hookers annoyed me, seeming over the top.  Of course I've never been around NYC hookers, so maybe they do actually behave that way.Technically, ""Phone Booth"" contained more originality than most flicks of this genre.  I loved the picture-in-picture effects.  Not only were they fun and refreshingly different, they were also a plot device, keeping you in the movie by holding you at the dramatic scene, yet simultaneously providing needed glimpses of other characters.  The choice not to reveal Sutherland until the epilogue was perfect.  It maintains tension by veiling the threat, and a hidden threat is almost always better than a visible one. 
Speaking of maintaining tension, the length (80 minutes) of ""Phone Booth"" was a wise decision.  Long movies are not inherently bad, but too many movies seem like they have been stretched out in order to hit the two hour time mark.  ""Phone Booth"" did what it had to do and got out on top.  It set the stage, introduced the necessary characters, then dove headlong into the suspense.  The suspense held up via crisp pacing and the constant logical thinking of each character.  All that led directly to the final act, which was both satisfying and entertaining.  Some will say that ""Phone Booth"" moralizes too much.  I understand the argument, but disagree with it.  What moralizing there is works because of its universal appeal to whatever inherent good humans possess.  While Farrell's smooth yet deceitful character appeals on the surface, when the proverbial push comes to shove, no one truly wants to be that kind of person.  Many people would welcome being forced into such brutal honesty, although preferably not under similar circumstances.  Bottom Line:  A superb popcorn flick, featuring good pacing and smart thinking.  Very enjoyable and satisfying throughout.  Three of four stars.",Phone Booth
157,jake-law123,Very stylish thriller!,8,10 December 2011,"I'm not sure what else Colin Farrell has been in, but I can honestly say that this is his breakthrough performance, very strong, very intense, and very convincing. He was throwing everything into this character, and he did one hell of a job. As for the story, very unique, not the most relate able or typical situation, which makes it all the more exciting. Very stylized with its cinematography, music, and dialogue.The story consists of New York publicist Stu Shepard, (Colin Farrell) making a phone call in a phone booth in time square to call the girl he's admiring, (whom he's hiding from his wife). Afterwards, he gets a call from a stranger who states facts abut Stu's life, which really concerns him. His cocky attitude eventually fades when the stranger says he has a sniper rifle pointed at Stu, threatening to shoot if he hangs up or tries to escape. The police get involved when a person is shot by the sniper, and Stu is the supposed killer.The film immediately gets in the story after a couple minutes of putting you in the New York environment, people using cellphones and payphones for their business. When the call with the stranger starts, I immediately noticed his voice wasn't as if hearing from the phone, but in a studio narrating the situation like Morgan Freeman. I liked this because it kept his presence away from the outside world, letting you know he wasn't really nearby. Colin Farrell is good at playing a cocky douche, because he pawns it off as some loser, and tries to offer him money and fame to leave him alone, then slowly throughout the film, as he's more and more scared, he becomes a helpless weakling.The style of the film really focused on the lighting of the city and cinematography, showing how a normal city immediately twists and turns for a man when he's threatened. A lot of thrillers and horror films nowadays use this style, with the speeding up/slowing down, as well as several shaky cam shots. The stranger is awesome because he acts like a normal person, he doesn't really act like a bad guy, he toys with Stu, and just has fun with it, making him say weird stuff to the cops. Though he is obsessed with exposing Stu as a fraud, not only to the cameras, but mostly his wife. The motive of the killer doesn't make too much sense, he picks out a selfish person, waits for him to use a payphone, then messes with him, like get a life bro, but whatever.Forest Whitaker as the captain tries to work with Stu, and gets very confused with Stu's reaction, as Stu isn't allowed to inform him of anything, which made me want to just jump in there and tell them all. I felt like I was in Colin's situation. Several cops pointing guns at him, one false move and he's dead, whether by the cops, or the killer. The frustrated Colin pulls it off incredibly well though.The whole film kept me on edge from beginning to end. The killer always had something to say to make it more interesting. The conversations between him and Colin are fun as hell. Colin has nothing to do but respond to the killer. I'm always wondering whether or not he's going to kill Colin, because a lot of times Colin pulls stunts where I can't believe the killer didn't kill him. But I guess that's just how much fun he was having with it.I enjoyed this quite a bit. It pulls off everything just right, the performance by Farrell and Whitaker, the style, the fast paced editing, etc. It just all clicked together.",Phone Booth

Colin Farrell, Kiefer Sutherland, Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, Katie Holmes, Paula Jai Parker, Arian Waring Ash, Tia Texada. Incredibly suspenseful thriller about a slick New York publicist named Stu Shepard (Farrell) who is trapped inside a phone booth (the last remaining one in Manhatten), on the line with a sniper (Sutherland, unseen until the film's final minute) who frames Stu for a sniper murder. Highly original film is suspenseful from beginning to end, offers several plot twists, and doesn't drag on like most thrillers do (running time is only 80 minutes). Farrell delivers an unparalleled performance and Whitaker is almost equally as good as the police captain who is determined to negotiate with Stu. Holmes, however, is completely wasted. RATING: 9 out of 10. Rated R for violence and profanity.",Phone Booth
159,skymovies,Let it ring,6,7 April 2003,"The idea of a sniper teaching a lesson to a morally bankrupt sleaze was recently done more convincingly in the Wesley Snipes/Linda Fiorentino flick Liberty Stands Still. While Phone Booth has the edge in terms of continuity and pacing, its characters mostly lack depth and/or motivation with the exception of Farrell's Stu. And the trouble with him is that you care for him as much at the end as when he's introduced, ie not at all.His tormentor goes to ridiculously elaborate lengths to single him out for persecution. Psychotic he may be, but he's obviously very intelligent and could surely find a more deserving target than a nobody like Stu?It all zips along at a fair old clip, so there's not much time to ponder why Stu's wife puts up with the selfish sod and what the animosity between Forest Whitaker and the negotiator is all about. Annoyingly, the moviemakers don't know whether they want to warn or reproach us about the fact that we're all phone junkies. So what if we are? It's called progress.The result is a lean but forgettable thriller that plays like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits but shoots itself in the foot with its underwritten supporting roles.",Phone Booth

Set in a noisy, gritty New York City downtown area, Dennis Franz (Sipowitz) could play the Forrest Whitaker role, supported by all his cast regulars, while a special guest star would take on the Colin Farrell character. The film, featuring unsavory hookers, a pimp, and two lovely leading ladies, easily imitates the classic TV program's style in look and action, also recalling the top=notch ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (1975), which starred Al Pacino in a better, and more developed script for a feature film length.

It didn't ever get boring, and all of the performances were good, especially Keiffer Sutherland, well voice I guess.  The really cool thing was in the theater, the sound was played according to where the character was at, so if Stu was talking to someone on his right ear, then that characters voice came from the right side of the theater.

163,dtb,Hitchcock & Kafka Meet In Times Square Via Larry Cohen's Pen,9,9 April 2004,"Contains Spoiler A tense, taut, darkly funny 81-minute package of Hitchcockian suspense set in New York City (although the scenes specifically involving the phone booth were filmed in Los Angeles, the art direction and veteran thriller genius Larry Cohen's biting script gave those scenes a very convincing Times Square ambience. It really reminded me of the seedy Times Square of my youth! :-), PHONE BOOTH is a film that everyone in front of and behind the camera should be proud of.  In particular, it's a tour de force for Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland.  Farrell, doing a good Bronx accent that also sounds slightly Latino-tinged to my native New Yorker ears, shows why he was long touted as The Next Big Thing even before he finally got some hit movies under his belt. As slippery publicist Stu Shepard, the intense, kinetic Farrell runs the gamut of emotions; he's like Nicolas Cage in dramatic mode without the scenery-chewing! :-) Sutherland has never been more sinister in a mostly voiceover role as Farrell's nemesis/self-appointed conscience. Ron Eldard reportedly did the voice of The Caller first, but maybe after seeing the rushes, PB director Joel Schumacher decided the part needed more star power and/or menace, so he recruited his old bud' and colleague Sutherland. It was a good move, and I'm not just saying that because Sutherland is one of my longtime faves. When Sutherland plays bad guys, he gets this great silky menace to his voice (kinda like James Mason without the British accent :-), and it's very effective in PB.  Sutherland is seen very briefly in the film, too, so I must assume they filmed that footage later, but it certainly blends in seamlessly with the rest of the movie. SPOILER ALERT... I actually found it darkly funny, even Kafkaesque, that The Caller's reasons for terrorizing arrogant married PR flack Stu included his aspiring to lure actress/client Pam (the ever-appealing Katie Holmes) into an affair. Think about it:  The Caller was so twistedly self-righteous and judgmental that he was punishing his victims (or Stu, anyway) for thought-crimes!  How Big Brother can you get?! :-) ...END SPOILER ALERT.  While PB was well worth seeking out in actual theaters, especially since it has lots of cool split-screen shots and inset effects that are especially effective on a big screen, its claustrophobic nature also makes it well-suited to the small TV screen. Check out Schumacher's enjoyable DVD commentary, too.",Phone Booth

However, thanks in no small part to the suspenseful camera work, Joel Schumacher's directing and the excellent performances given by Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland, ""Phone booth"" ends up being an intense nail biter that always knows how to take it's premise to new and exciting directions all the way to it's thrilling climax.",Phone Booth
170,chthon2,I didn't like it.,5,30 July 2003,"The premise of this film is interesting - a man is caught in a phone booth by a sniper - but it just doesn't work.  Like 'Liberty Stands Still', another movie that failed with the same premise, the movie has little action and rather flat dialogue, and this is coming from a guy who really doesn't care for action films.  I feel a bit bad saying that, since I really can't think of anything better, but it's not my movie, so it isn't my job to make it better anyway.Colin Farrell is an interesting person: an actor who is both good and overrated at the same time.  Considering that most young actors his age are practically painful to watch, seeing Farrell display a range of emotions through his facial expression is refreshing and reassuring.  He's not great, however; many people tend to gush about him a bit much.  He's still young, and although he is good, it doesn't seem that he's gotten over that ""I'm trying so hard and it will break my heart if people don't like me even though I pretend I don't care what people think"" attitude yet.  I guess that's not his fault, since he isn't as experienced as other actors yet; it's just that some people say he's going to be the next great leading man, and I say: wait.  I think he has the potential to be, but only time will tell.Also, I have to talk about the film's ending.  So, this is the *SPOILER* warning here.--I was very put off by the ending.  This trend in Hollywood to have bad guys never receive retribution bothers me.  In fact, in many popular films now we're expected to sympathize with robbers and thieves, who are often leading characters.  Farrells character is by no means a good guy, but Sutherland should not have gotten away.  He had no right to do what he did.  I just had to say something about that.Aside from that, the film is adequate.  They didn't do as well as they could have with the premise, so I would say it's an average film.",Phone Booth

It's thrilling, it's interesting and it's not that long. With a shockingly original premise, and an amazing screenplay that lives up to that premise.Pros:""Phone Booth's"" protagonist (Stuart) starts out as an unlikable jerk, but by the end is forced to confront his issues. As before the film, he was a lying, cheating person. But when one of the people he screwed over, takes his own unique revenge, he is forced to tell everyone about his crimes. As the film goes on, we are able to sympathize with the main character's situation more and more.The villain of the film (""The Caller""), is also great, he has the perfect voice for this role. And as he pushes the protagonist more and more to do more drastic things, it gets more and more thrilling to watch. And by the end of the film, he had gotten away with it all.The movie also understands how to build tension, as we start the film with unusual occurrences. Such as, when the main character, Stuart, has a pizza he didn't order delivered to him, in a phone booth. That was weird, but then he gets a call in the phone booth, he picks it up, and it's someone who starts to threaten him. And he events soon get crazier as the movie goes on.Joel Schumacher really knows how to direct the film, giving the film an interesting feel, and the goes for the writer Larry Cohen. The city in this world feels colorful and interesting, even if a little over the top.Cons:I think Colin Farrell is only okay in his performance, he wasn't as good as Kiefer Sutherland in his role as the Caller. He does have some great moments to shine, but some of his reads felt fake. Honestly, other than that, it's hard to find a flaw.Conclusion:""Phone Booth"" is an excellent thriller and unique film, it's one of my most underrated films, and one of my favorite films. The characters are well written, the movie understands the value of build up, and keeps you invested throughout. The movie is only an hour and 20 minutes, so it's not that long.

174,Snake-666,One of the best movies I have ever seen!,8,9 July 2003,"After having finally seen this exceptional and original movie I can now safely say that this is the best movie of 2002 that I have seen so far. Exciting, emotional, intense, genius, brilliant  all these words and more can be used to describe this amazing thriller that is Phone Booth'.Stuart (Colin Farrell), a New York publicist, is at a phone booth after just finishing a conversation with Pamela (Katie Holmes), a young woman whom he is trying to get into bed, despite already being married to Kelly (Radha Mitchell). When the phone rings Stuart picks it up probably believing it to be Pamela calling back, unfortunately for him he has just answered a call from a man with a rather twisted view on morality (Kiefer Sutherland) and now is at the mercy of the caller who proves to the distressed Stuart that he is able to see Stuart's every move through the sight of the sniper rifle he has targeting the phone booth.This movie is pure genius in my opinion. In the space of around an hour and a half we are taken through almost every possible emotion without ever really leaving the phone booth. Phone Booth' is certainly an emotional rollercoaster of a movie and it's surprising that such a simple idea can result in one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion, and now my favourite movie of last year. Phone Booth' is a chilling and intense examination of how far one man will go to keep his secrets. Which is more important  your life or your secrets? Just how much would you try to withhold if your life were on the line? On top of that, would you value your own life over that of those you love? All these questions are tackled in the movie and are dealt with extremely well and with a definite air of credibility. Despite his dishonest traits it becomes easy to empathise with Stuart to the point where you can literally feel what he is feeling. This is a brilliant quality for a movie to have and Phone Booth' manages to immerse the viewer into its world. Morality questions are also asked, is it right for someone to kill someone else on the basis that the victim was morally corrupt? In some ways there is an underlying social commentary on the state of the world today present in Phone Booth' which asks a lot of questions without taking an overly serious approach. Even though it cannot be denied that this is indeed a very dark, and in some ways disturbing, movie there are still some humorous times intermingled with moments that can almost bring the viewer to tears.The acting has to be some of the best I have seen in a long time from almost every member of the cast even right down to the actors with lesser parts. Colin Farrell puts in a performance that in my opinion is worthy of so much more than an MTV Movie Award and he is supported brilliantly by the veteran Forest Whittaker who plays his role as police Captain Ramey with style. Between Stu and Ramey a bond forms almost reminiscent of the bond between McClane and Powell in Die Hard'. Kiefer Sutherland's voice is chilling as the twisted `caller' and certainly helps to create the dark atmosphere that Phone Booth' portrays. This really is a film that needed strong acting to work, and luckily strong acting is what it had. As more than ninety per cent of the film takes place in one area there is no need for rip-roaring action scenes or multi-million dollar special effects but instead a need for a strong cast. Every single performer in Phone Booth' deserves recognition as they are the people who made this movie great. Joel Schumacher deserves some credit too for the way he directed this movie and Larry Cohen for writing such an amazing screenplay but even so it is the cast that made the film what it is.I'm not going to go on and on about how amazing this movie is as I believe I have already said enough. If you haven't already seen this movie I certainly recommend that you check it out. My rating for Phone Booth'  9.5/10.",Phone Booth

Very little action doesn't make it a boring flick. In fact, i only looked at the clock hoping the movie would keep going. Which brings me to my only complaint: it's only 81 minutes.

178,cableaddict,Doesn't deserve the praise. AT ALL.,2,28 February 2004,"Well, a lot of folks seem to like this one.  I don't understand why. 
It's a technically well-made movie, I guess, but the plot has nowhere to go. It could have been an interesting 15 minute short, I guess.There are implausible sequences through the whole thing.  Absolutely nothing in this movie is believable.  The holes in the plot are large enough to drive a house through.  Minor spoilers ahead:For starters: Given the guy's personality, as it is established right in the beginning, there is no way he would have stayed on the line for more than 15 seconds, and he certainly would not have answered again when it rang a second time.  That all happens LONG before the warning shot is fired. It makes no sense at all.  -And he doesn't tell the pimp that he can't leave because there's a shooter? At that point in time, the shooter hadn't yet warned the guy NOT to say anything.  Oh well, no matter....   Biggest problem of all:The police would have learned immediately that the pimp was facing the phone booth when shot, yet he was shot in the back, and this didn't tip them off? Are you kidding me?  (not to mention the hookers who were staring right at the two men and just MIGHT have noticed that the guy in the phone never raised his arms or pointed anything when the pimp was hit.  -But this doesn't seem to bother the director.  Also, I do believe that NYC cops would be able to recognize a wound made by a rifle fired from 200 feet away. Such a wound looks, er, slightly different than a wound made by a handgun at six inches.   duh...-and there are many other impossibilities.  for instance, the supposed shooter-suicide guy would have already been somewhat cold by the time they burst into the room. NYC swat teams aren't quite that stupid. 
-And how exactly did the bad guy manage to end up driving the ambulance? Why would he have had the proper uniform on? There is no way he could have known how the whole thing would end up. The shooter expected either the good guy to walk away humiliated, or dead. Either way, the bad guy would not need to be driving any ambulance.    This movie is so stupid, it boggles my mind that anyone was entertained by it.  I'm so insulted by this directer that I'm actually angry about it.  The whole movie insulted my intelligence.  At least completely implausible B-movies usually don't take themselves seriously.
I watched this because there was absolutely nothing else on, and I had work to do and just wanted noise in the backround.  It was still a complete waste of time.  You've been warned.",Phone Booth
179,matlefebvre20,"Do not hang up, it's a good movie",7,21 March 2007,"After seeing what he'd done with the Batman franchise and Nicolas Cage in ""8MM"", you wouldn't believe that Joel Schumacher could make a good movie, would you? ""Phone Booth"", starring Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland, is a surprisingly astounding film and a near-perfect example of psychological thriller. And I insist on both words because none of them is separable from the other.Farrell is Stu, a NY press agent who oversees everybody and has a wife (Radha Mitchell), as well as a mistress (Katie Holmes). He seems to appreciate his lifestyle but everything is about to change into an unforgettable way.After Stu called up his mistress in a phone booth, the phone rings. Stu answers, only to find himself ear-to-ear with a sniper (voiced by Sutherland).It's now that the twisted mind game begins. The sniper is a typical one, ie. that he knows everything about everybody, including Stu. He claims to be some kind of angel-like figure who wants to force sinners to expiate their faults to the society. And this time, he aims Stu.Rarely have I seen a thriller so exciting, so mind-torturing. These sensations are mainly due to Farrell and Sutherland.Farrell offers an extraordinary performance as Stu. We can feel his fear, his anger, his desperation during the short 80 minutes of the movie. His transformation is real and sincere. We really can feel it.Sutherland's role is as great, but for different reasons. His task is gigantic: to sound menacing, bright, skillful and sarcastic only with his voice. And he fits perfectly. The result is that the Sutherland-voiced sniper becomes as terrifying and frightening as other mind players, such as Hannibal Lecter.Merit should also be given to screenwriter Larry Cohen. The ""Phone Booth"" script is easily his best after ""Carrie"", which he wrote almost 25 years earlier. The story is simple, but very intelligent, very developed.The conclusion is stupendous. At first, I believed that I was watching another one of these thriller conclusions that are half-cooked because they can't render justice to the main part. But then the plot twists and we just can't believe that we've been fooled like that.I also liked the cinematography. Mainly the screen divided in multiple parts, so the viewer can follow many scenes at once. It's nicely depicted by director Schumacher.I deserve great regards for ""Phone Booth"", especially for Farrell and Sutherland. It's one of the greatest thrillers of the still young 21st century and it acts as some kind of redemption for critic scapegoat Joel Schumacher.By the way, would you dare to go into a phone booth after you see this movie?",Phone Booth
180,cmovies-99674,Words can't describe how much awful this movie is,2,19 October 2017,"PROS: COLIN FARREL isn't a bad actor, nor is he bad to look at. But in all seriousness, the acting wasn't too bad. Most of the time the characters were stagnant, even the person on the phone, but they were more good than bad on average. That's why it's a pro.CONS: The movie was wicked boring. When you have a one location thriller it becomes vital that you find something in that one location that could help influence the depth of the story. I felt that the director trapped himself in a corner when he chose this location. He ended up relying too heavily on character development to make the story scary, but that was a poor decision. It was a questionable choice because the actors were mediocre, and a movie that relies so heavily on acting (like the director anticipated) needs to have that something special to propel the movie forward. Since they didn't have this the movie fell flat. To summarize this bit, you had a man standing in a box with nothing really captivating or alluring to keep you watching and the only thing you did have to watch was OK actors waiting to say their lines. If that snippet wasn't enough, the ending was horrific. Not in like horror meaning scary, like horror meaning omg this is awful. The end sort of takes everything that was done in the movie and throws it away, in a garbage can, that then goes to the landfill, then gets squished and incinerated. That was how bad the end was, and that was all to top off a boring movie with a man standing talking with a stranger for 2 hours.www.chorror.com",Phone Booth
181,eamon-hennedy,A Fantastic Thriller!,9,27 October 2003,"***CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS***This is a fantastic film. Eighty minutes of pure delight, it just goes to show that even if you keep it simple, you can create a thriller of sheer suspense. With no special effects, little in the way of locations, Phone Booth keeps it simple and it works a treat. This film does for phone boxes what Jaws did for going to beach and what Psycho did for showers. The film is a fantastic thriller that never outstays its welcome (it only lasts for about eighty minutes) and creates suspense out of the smallest of actions. The nightmarish plot is well thought up and Joel Schumacher delivers his best film since Falling Down.What I love most about this film is how writer Larry Cohen really squeezes every  inch out of his plot. The film starts of slightly humorous, with the whole notion of this plot quite funny and how the main character of Stu reacts to the strange man on the other end threatening him. It is the fast paced development of the script and how this peculiar plot turns into the worst nightmare of a scenario. Stu gets harassed by a couple of prostitutes looking to use the phone, then gets harassed by their pimp which turns physical which results in said pimp's death. Then come the police and then the sharp shooters. This is what I really look for in a thriller. It has what Hitchcock knew that makes up a great thriller. A regular man in an extraordinary situation. Stu finds himself in a waking nightmare that may result in the loss of his marriage and life.The central performance from Colin Farrell is quite frankly superb. His flawless American accent to his on the spot response to the situation right through to the stunning moment where he 'confesses'  his sins truly makes this an enthralling and gripping film. Special mention must go to Kiefer Sutherland for his fantastic vocal performance as the shooter. The dark humor and menacing threat that exudes this performance is undeniably superb and makes, for the first time I can remember, the first instance where a voice is more frightening than a killer with a knife and a mask. Completing the central trio is Forrest Whitiker, magnificent as the cop who must defuse the situation.This is a superb thriller on every level. The direction, script and performances ensure this is as one of the best Hollywood thriller in recent years, made all the more surprising that this is a film as far away from Hollywood that has been made in a long time.",Phone Booth
182,Cephyran,"Oh yes, you will like it...",8,18 June 2003,"I have to applaud this movie. It is strong, vivid, and quite brilliant.Joel Shumacher has given this movie the energy and intelligence it so rightfully presents, which makes it hard to hold Batman and Robin against him. I love this kind of movie. The setting isn't so visually spastic, and stays within a relevant boundary that keeps the characters enjoyable and believable. Colin Farrell is one of those guys who's going to be in everything for the next ten years or so. And who says that's a bad thing? Absolutely saturating his schedule with Daredevil, The Recruit, this and that new historic epic he's apparently in, he doesn't seem to have a lot of free time. But he makes up for it. While some may think him a target for tabloid spam, he's got as great diversity in his character abilities. This role is particularly good, since he goes from a spiffy business man who thinks he's on top of the world to a subdued man with his life spread before him. Keifer Sutherland is an incredible actor. Not only does he have the coolest evil voice, his has set and is the bar for dramatic thriller acting. In this movie he plays the villain, although it is really an extremist vigilantism. I don't want to explain why - you have to see it. And trust me, you'll like it.",Phone Booth
183,acearms,A thriller of merit.,9,10 October 2003,"Before viewing it I was skeptical at now the movie was going to play out. I started out looking for goofs and mistakes to a point, thinking this may be a real dog.  BUT I was pleasantly surprised at the suspense and quality of the filming.  The attention to details was superb down to the sniper rifle with silencer and reloading equipment in the apartment, things a sniper would use.  Collin Farrell's acting is second to none, and Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland are truly great as ever.  One goof I did notice, the sniper claimed to be able to ""see"" the dial on the pay phone, however the angle at which he was looking was 90 degrees to it and therefore it would not of been possible. If you want to view an attention getting movie with some really outstanding acting THIS ONE IS A MUST.",Phone Booth

185,tml_pohlak_13,A surprisingly well-made movie!,9,2 January 2009,"I've never been a fan of Joel Schumacher. He's responsible for a few films down in my ""most-hated"" list, including ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Batman and Robin"". I approached ""Phone Booth"" skeptically. The idea was interesting, but I trusted Joel Schumacher to screw up again. And for the first 10 or so minutes, it seemed I was right.Joel Schumacher has an uncanny ability to play inappropriate or annoying music during the opening credits of his films. ""Phone Booth"" was no exception, as the song grated on my nerves.The movie rarely strays from the phone booth. Boring as it may sound, it is a pleasant surprise, just as ""Speed"" was a surprisingly good movie, although it mostly took place on a bus.The movie begins in the style of a boring documentary produced by Disney. I was tempted to shut it off before we even met the ""last occupant of the phone booth"". But the movie skyrockets as soon as we meet Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell).Stu is caught up in a web of lies, cheating on his wife (Radha Mitchell) with Pam (Katie Holmes), who is not even aware he is married. He calls Pam from a phone booth everyday (although he has a cellphone, he doesn't want his wife Kelly to see any record of his calls). On a day like any other, Stu enters the booth, removes his wedding ring, and calls Pam. After a talk with her, he gets ready to leave the booth when the phone rings. He picks it up.The Caller (Kiefer Sutherland) is without a doubt the most important element of the film. Mostly invisible throughout the film, the Caller reveals to Stu that he is a sniper and will kill Stu if he leaves the booth. Sutherland's voice is bone-chilling. It is the voice of a psychotic person, yet an extremely intelligent and calculating one. The Caller's voice has to work in order for the movie to work, and boy, does it work!Just a last comment. I'm not sure if this was a glitch with the DVD or if the movie was edited this way, but I should mention a problem I had viewing the movie. Whenever a ""conversation window"" was on the right side of the screen, only Stu's side of the conversation was heard. (Thank God for subtitles!) This and the opening few minutes are the only things that keep me from rating the movie as a 10.So Joel Schumacher CAN make a good movie after all...",Phone Booth
186,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Phone Booth,8,14 April 2003,"There are millions of cell phones in the United States alone. Hundreds of millions in Japan, England as well as other European countries are used every day. But when was the last time you used a phone booth to call your wife or to call a client or something like that? Not many people can really say ""Just recently"" in the modern high-tech world we live in today. But the phone booth is the backdrop for the new thriller starring rising star Colin Farrell. The film has been delayed several times due to the recent sniper shootings in the Washington D.C. area but has finally made it to theaters. But will the delay kill the project or will movie-goers rise above the bad memories and catch the flick?The story goes that a man named Stu Shepard who is a big shot New York publicist. He makes many phone calls day in and day out to many clients. But today is different. For once, he is getting a call. Not from his cell phone but from a phone booth. A phone booth that is planned to torn day the next day. Stu does not know the man who is calling him but he does everything the man tells him. Why? The man who calls Mr. Shepard is a man who is aiming a sniper rifle right at him and if Stu does something he doesn't like then somebody has to pay for his mistakes. Stu is forced to face his fears including the thoughts he has had about cheating on his wife.The story for Phone Booth is very well done. Going into this film, you might be a little worried about the film especially after the recent sniper shootings in Washington but the film is presented in the right tone so no one is offended by any material presented within the course of the feature. Another worry is the director, who many blame for killing the Batman film franchise but those worries should be put to reset with Phone Booth.The cast of Phone Booth is very well assembled. There were many A-list actors offered the lead role in Phone Booth. Among those actors were Jim Carrey, Will Smith, and Brad Pitt. But perhaps it was better they did not land the role. In this type of situation, the celebrity playing a character in a phone booth is just a celebrity in a phone booth. You don't actually feel for the character if you know they are an A-list actor. Colin Farrell, who is becoming a rising star being featured in such films as Minority Report, The Recruit, and Daredevil, is the perfect match for the film. Since he is not as big as a star like Tom Cruise, he makes you feel worried for him throughout the course of the film but his rising star power does take some of that feeling away as well. Though you do not see him much in the film, Kiefer Sutherland is fabulous as the voice of the sniper. It is more difficult to convince an audience that you are a certain character just by using your voice then it is acting on screen and the movie audience should applaud what he does for this film. Maybe it was better he was not seen with many recognizing him only for his work on the television series 24 more then anything else. Forest Whitaker, who is the host of the new Twilight Zone on UPN, is pretty good but you don't see much character development from him which is slightly disappointing. Katie Holmes is fine as the girl Stu is interested in but you only see her in a few scenes so her character is nothing more then a small spot within the course of the whole film. Not that her character is not important but you never get to see her full range of acting.Overall, Phone Booth is very fascinating thriller that is highly recommended especially with the large amount of low rate fare that is currently out in theaters. Though the film is wonderful, there are some things to pick at. Such things include the length of the film. The film seemed too rushed at moments. Another thing to pick at is the use of slow motion and fast motion effects throughout the course of the feature. Some of them were well placed but many were unnecessary. This was also a problem in another Colin Farrell feature, Daredevil. Also some of the characters could have used better character developments then they received. Other then those small things, Phone Booth is highly recommended except for those who may have bad memories about the recent sniper shootings in Washington or any terrorism attack for that matter.My Rating: **** out of 5",Phone Booth
187,98nurdinm-1,"""Phone Booth""",7,16 June 2008,"Two names who aren't exactly my favourite names in the movie world: Colin Farrell and Joel Schumacher. The first because I often find him annoying, pretentious, arrogant, and so on. The second because I can never forgive him for ""Batman & Robin"". So its fair to say I had my trepidations for this film in which Farrell is the lead and Schumacher is the director. Thankfully, I was wrong to have doubts. ""Phone Booth"" is a magnificent return to form for Schumacher - a suspenseful, surprising mini-labyrinth of a film, with perhaps even slight elements of Hitchcockian film making. The film is set mainly in the title phone booth and the street it is on, and once Farrell's character of Stu Shepherd gets to the aforementioned telephone we never really leave it again. For this to work properly there have to be two factors that help us to ignore the claustrophobic settings: dialogue and acting. The plot is well written, simple yet effective. All in all its mainly a two-hander between Farrell and his anonymous captive. The latter is played with menacing vigour by Keifer Sutherland, who is never really seen throughout the majority of the film, and so has to pull of a a very convincing voice over gig. It is also a tour de force for Farrell, who takes his character from arrogant, pretentious, self-centred (hmmm...) to sympathetic, redemptive, decent. It's just a shame that there is not much of a role for the always excellent Forest Whitaker, though I'm kind of grateful that Katie Holmes has even less time.Another complaint I would have is the length of the film. Okay, so its short, snappy and to the point, but you do feel a little short-changed towards the end. It's as if the plot ran out of money before you could finish the call. Still, for tense, enjoyable entertainment, you could do much worse than this.7/10",Phone Booth
188,evilmatt-3,A good man is hard to find,9,4 April 2003,"Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times gave what I fear is an alarmingly typical review of _Phone Booth_, calling it a thriller that becomes ""tedious moralizing.""  Oy.  The only thing I can say to you people is to run along and watch _The Core_ or whatever movie is currently making fun of African American culture for cheap laughs._Phone Booth_ is a fantastic film, as well as one of the more socially important movies to come out lately.  The basic idea of the movie is that, while you may not need to be a firefighter to be a hero, you don't need to be a rapist or murderer to be a monster, either.  Stu Shepard is just such a monster.  He's not being punished for his past actions so much as he is reaping the benefits of his attitude towards his fellow human beings.  This is a simple but effective story about humanity and redemption, and to look at it as a moral treatise is to do it a great disservice.Technically, the film doesn't demand much.  This is good, considering that Schumacher has proven himself to be a fairly incompetent director (having inflicted upon the world such cinematic wonders as _Batman Forever_ and _8MM_).  In fact, the beginning sequences of the film led me to believe that Schumacher would indeed ruin the experience; they are the only times he is really given creative freedom and they are so gratingly annoying I actually felt myself getting angry.The film is script and actor driven, though, and it has plenty of both to go around.  Colin Farrell is a knockout and Keifer Sutherland strikes just the right tone for the film.  Forrest Whitaker looks a little confused (like always) but is ultimately satisfactory as a misguided cop who secretly fancies himself a therapist.The main thrust of this film is as simple and powerful as that of the writings of Flannery O'Connor decades before: do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  The right thing is always easy to do when you have a gun pointed in your face.  _Phone Booth_ realizes that the audience members aren't in that situation, but challenges them to be excellent human beings anyway.See it if you're willing to reflect on yourself after watching.",Phone Booth

From the moment your whisked to that first page, your captivated by not only it's content and players, yet it's ability to keep a consistent high rpm pace. And all... from a phone booth. Not only dialed in with a captivating performance by Collin Farrell, Cohen wrote a witty, exciting, realistic and at times humorous film which Batman director Schumacher craftily brings together so effortlessly.

190,eddiez61,Friggin Stupid Premise Made Even More Horrible by a Corny Script.,3,2 January 2011,"There's a good reason many people never use public phones anymore. Is it 'cause a crazed sniper might be aiming a high power rifle at your heart? No, of course not. People don't like to use public phones because who knows what vile contagious filth is there to smear off onto you. And that's how I felt after sitting through this absurd turd, like I had been infected with something foul. I needed a long hot shower to get the horrible stink off me; the stink of shame for having allowed myself to be duped by its promise of something original, something real.A slick, vain, arrogant prick that's cheating on his lovely, angelic wife? That's not so original. Oh right, he hasn't cheated yet, but he was JUST about to. HA!! And his lovely, angelic wife might happen to check his cell phone 'cause apparently he can't be trusted. Wait a minute. If she's so pure and wonderful why would she be creeping on him? Not really explained. And the idea of him not having a secret throw away cell phone for his illicit activity is beyond idiocy. There's just no way around that enormous gaping hole in the story. But it didn't stop the imbecilic writers from trudging on with their tedious odyssey.There's a primal pleasure that this crappy film wants to cater to - the desire to see innocent unsuspecting people exterminated for no good reason - but it retreats from this challenging idea so meekly. Senseless unconditional mayhem is a more honest premise for a movie than the con job this one pulls in needing us to believe that the sleaze ball PR agent might actually deserve to be shot dead. It's so cowardly of the people responsible for this ridiculous film to hide behind this idea. That they must justify their gratuitous mayhem with a moral cause is just pandering to the hypocrites, and that's the definition of depraved. When I annihilate pedestrians when I'm playing Grand Theft Auto I get such a rush. I don't first concoct back stories for each victim of how they have disgraced themselves hopelessly and my mortal violence is an act of divine justice (although that actually sounds like a good premise for a movie). I just love to blow 'em away! That's what a guilty pleasure is all about. But no, in the moral universe of this sad film only the nasty, evil pimp Leon is executed. We all know he was going to hell anyway, right? Stupid premise, stupid script, stooopid ethics. And stupid me for sitting through this slop till the end.

191,vvanpo,Tough to Call,5,24 April 2003,"I don't like the phone.  I refuse to have a cell phone (as if anybody would call me).  When I'm on the phone, I feel compelled to fill the dead air unlike when I'm with someone face-to-face.How would a film maker handle the big problem with phone conversations: actors not seeing each other face-to-face or rather the audience knowing the actors are not face-to-face?  Joel Schumacher gives it a shot.  For one he uses elaborate split-screens to show all the people in the conversation. With the one big exception of course in the antagonist.  But even with him, the audience hears all the voices as if they are in the same room.  None of that metallic sound one usually hears in movie phone conversations.The vast majority of the scenes take place at a phone booth located in a seedy part of Manhattan that I thought Giuliani had eradicated upon the orders of Disney Co.  The booth was Colin Farrell's character's choice to set up his rendezvous that instead became his cage locked in by a menacing Caller.Here's my biggest problem.  Who is this Caller who would threaten not only Colin, his loved ones and kill cold-bloodedly just because Colin is a massive heel and needs to see the error of his ways? And invest so much effort to do so?  No human for sure. Is this caller supposed to be some evil spirit visiting upon us?

The pacing is done nicely, and the film seems to fly by, almost like an advert, and you expect the main feature afterwards. Colin Farrell is the main man in the booth, and he does the best job he could do in that tough role. He yells a bit too much, but the downward spiral of the ongoing situation is very believable, with him provoking enough sympathy for him to care. However the caller's voice (kiefer sutherland)is a little on the bad side. It's not realistic, no-one talks like that, and it's through him that the weak dialogue shines through. It didn't need to be brilliant, but some of the lines are just too bad to forgive.

Considering his passion for explosions and fast-cutting, he made good use of the claustrophobic setting of the phone booth. Suprised at the decent level of acting which made the characters believable; Colin Farrell basically had to carry the film because he's on-screen nearly all the time, and it benefits from his presence, he's going to be huge, good luck to the guy.

It took a strong performance by Colin Farrell to make this a super movie. Basically, he's in a phone booth talking to some nutjob who knows more than he should. Some hookers bother him because they want the phone. He won't let them, and they get their boss, and the boss gets shot by a sniper rifle. The police come and think Stu (the character, not me) shot the guy, so Stu has a sniper aimed at him from the nutjob in a high-rise and guns pointed at him from the police. He can't leave the booth, or the sniper will kill him, nor can he tell the police why he won't come out for the same reason.

203,loogenhausen,Let It Go To Voicemail...,7,9 November 2011,"Most people don't know it, but Joel Schumacher is actually quite a talented director. He'll never live down the embarrassment of 'Batman & Robin' but since then he has had two films that are top notch productions. 'Tigerland' is one. This is the other. Schumacher and Colin Farrell re team for the second time (Farrell also starred in 'Tigerland', his breakout role) and really ratchet up the tension with a free-fall thriller that goes for broke at a breakneck pace. The story moves incredibly fast at a brisk 80 minutes or so, stopping a scant few times to try to develop some character moments. There's no time for silly subplots or excess narrative, which is one of the film's strong points. The performances are at the very least pretty decent. There are some ham-fisted moments among the tension, mostly from Farrell, but he does do a nice job of carrying the picture since he's in virtually 99% of the movie. Keifer Sutherland is sufficiently menacing and acerbic as the mysterious sniper/caller, although he sometimes sounds like Jeremy Irons' character Scar from 'The Lion King.' The ending is well done and doesn't lead to a silly action chase or dumb set-piece where the hero goes after the bad guy, which would have blown the whole movie completely. Congrats to Schumacher for making a small, claustrophobic film with some nice acting. It does have some silly dialogue at times, as well as a few lapses of logic, but it doesn't overstay its welcome and will remain known as a fast, cheap and rather effective exercise in small-scale suspense.",Phone Booth
204,amraampk,gr8 and f9,10,25 April 2009,"a very very impressive and gripping kind of psychological thriller i have ever seen in my life. Colin Farrel was great in his role while on the other hand kiefer Sutherland did the most best tremendous job as the unknown hidden caller who never showed up until the end comes. The real movie starts at the time when Colin Farrel is held hostage at the phone booth by the unknown hidden kiefer Sutherland but before he also puts the curtain away from the secret life of Farrel on the other line by calling his girl friend and Farrel was listening but wasn't able to do any thing then he demonstrate to Farrel that he has got an eye on him , a telescopic view through a 50 caliber rifle and if he tries to walk away he ll be shot at point blank range. and now the chase begins when Stu Shepard is forced to tell the truths about his life which he hided form his wife , girlfriend, his secretary and colleagues. Forrest Whitaker plays here the police detective who arrives at the scene when a crime is committed and Farrel is considered as prime suspect but he is amazed by the ongoing situation , he really wants to know who s on the line with Farrel , what conversation they are having how can he make Farrel out of the booth and surrender. In this scenario of the movie the shooter in fact is a person who hates lier's , deceptive and hypocrites , his main purpose is to punish them by his own and expose their mysterious double standard lives with fraud attitude.

Stu is annoying, but we do understand from the very first sequences he's just a deluded prick... to be honest nobody an actual serial killer would bother stalking. The killer himself... who is he? His messiah complex isn't explored oor explained, so it's hard getting into the story when the two main characters are so lifeless and forgettable. The rest is kinda there just to make it to the end... The troubled detective, about whom we found out nothing at all.

209,billcody,Not bad!,7,7 April 2003,"A friend of mine got me to break one of my cardinal rules and actually go see another Joel Schumacher film. And you know what? It wasn't half bad. In fact it was pretty good.A variation on one of the most difficult films to pull off - i.e. a movie where all the action takes place in one location (one of the reasons so many stage plays fail as effective cinema) - Phone Booth is a tour de force for Colin Farrell and whatever the merits of his over inflated price tag he's up to the task with some considerable help from Forrest Whitacker and Kiefer Sutherland. A fun movie that at 80 minutes long does not overstay it's welcome. Why can't more flicks end when they are obviously supposed to - instead of tacking on 20 to 30 minutes of garbage that was so obviously inspired by the inane notes from a bunch of agents and studio suits? Those unbelievable ""twists"" that most studio movies end with only inspire the audience to leave the theater muttering in disgust and annoyance.   
One more quick note to any studio hacks that might be reading this (and I know that's a bit of a stretch - movie hacks reading fan posts rather than gumming  up the message boards with fake comments) - this film was successful at the box office (the first week anyway) and it was written by a man who is over 60 years old. It played young and hip - and was written by a man over 60 years old! It played believable and it was written by a man over 60 years old!!!",Phone Booth
210,Joseph_Gillis,"You're not supposed to like a Joel Schumacher film, but...",7,1 July 2017,"I could see myself watching this again, although that's mostly for Forest Whitaker's alternately balletic and swaggering performance (the best big-screen fat man since Jackie Gleason's 'Minnesota Fats?), and the dialogue that Kiefer Sutherland gets to speak, and his demonic cackle.The phone booth of the title is located in mid-town Manhattan, and it's special for being the booth that fast-talking, lying, cheating publicist (Colin Farrell) uses for making motel dates with his girlfriend, because he knows his wife checks his cell-phone bills. Kiefer's an embittered crack-shot tech-wiz ex-Vietnam vet. psycho who's set himself up as some kind of moral arbiter (versatile, isn't he?); he's privy to Farrell's work and play mis-steps, and decides he's fair game for atonement (His previous targets - ultimately, victims - were proper criminals, which would cause one to question his basis of target-selection, given small-time Farrell's inclusion on his list. But at least he claims that he's prepared to set Farrell free, if the degree of his atonement warrants it.)Given that the movie is set almost entirely in and around the phone- booth it's something of a high-wire act to maintain a viewer's interest. That's partly overcome by Kiefer's frequently hilarious demands, and the almost staggering incompetence of the small army of cops that descend on the scene, 'Dog Day Afternoon'-style. But once Forest Whitaker arrives, you know you'll not want to take your eyes off the screen for a split second.Colin Farrell's is a somewhat thankless task, given the character he portrays, and the confined space he has to operate in - in contrast to the wide open spaces available to Whitaker - but I think he pretty much wrings every last inch out of his dialogue, and his reactions to Kiefer's demands. Which frequently cut me up; credit to him for keeping a straight face, throughout. And, given that he's playing a liar and a cheat, there's always the possibility that those tears, and those cries of anguish, are fake.But despite Farrell's tour-de-force performance, Forrest Whitaker bestrides this film like a colossus, in more ways than one.Of course, once you see Larry Cohen's screenplay credit you know it's going to be chock-full of implausibilities, and no little black humour, and it didn't disappoint. But the much-maligned Mr. Schumacher must bear substantial credit for pulling all the strings together, without you seeing the joins. Watch, and enjoy - without prejudice.",Phone Booth
211,grumpyass,Very Very Good,10,14 July 2003,"I thought Phone Booth was an excellent movie.  though I wish it wasn't postponed but I understand why they did it.  I liked the concept of it shot in one area and didn't move at all.  I also like they shots with in shots that you see on screen.  I think that idea was great so you don't have to cut back and forth you see all the action that goes on at the same time.

Phone booth started that way but didn't end that way.

214,tohu,Not as good as it should be,6,21 May 2006,"This film is about a young guy who gets trapped in a public phone booth where he is menaced by a maniac sniper on the line who is watching him. And it's OK. My disappointment is that, for various reasons, I thought it was going to be much better.I loved the basic premise, and I thought the casting was interesting. I'd also heard positive things about it. But in reality, far from gripping me as I thought it would, I found my mind wandering a bit by half-way through - and it's the kind of film where that shouldn't really happen.Colin Farrell is good, as is the disembodied voice of Keifer Sutherland. The director tries a number of innovative techniques like split screens etc. which give it a curiosity value. Personally, I found the constant music soundtrack intrusive after a while but I commend them for trying it as something different.So see it by all means. Just don't expect too much. All that's wrong with PhoneBooth is that the tension is just that bit more slack than it needs to be in films like this, and that's what makes it a decent film rather than an excellent one.",Phone Booth
215,Nolamoviedude,Keifer is Ghostface,7,30 June 2020,"Remember the opening scene from Scream? Where there is a faceless caller calling Drew Berrymore and telling her that he's watching her? Well basically they took that concept and put it into a movie. I was half expecting Keifer Sutherland to ask Colin Farrell what his favorite scary movie was.Anyway, Colin plays a con artist like publicist/casting agent using his position to get it on with a naive young actress (Katie Holmes). He uses the same phone booth to call her each day in order to not have a record on his cell phone of the calls for his wife to see. A faceless caller (Sutherland) watches him each day and acts as some sort of psycho moral police. He's got a sniper rifle pointed at Colin in some unknown window and wants Colin to tell on himself. He wants him to make amends as the entire NYPD and media watch this all unfold. The media and NYPD have no idea of Keifer's existence and think Colin has a gun and is suicidal.The concept works as the film keeps you on the edge of your seat and is only 81 minutes long.",Phone Booth
216,illegal_alien51,Nice but irritating,2,29 April 2004,"*spoilers* I've kinda started to get quite fed up with movies where the bad guy knows everything about his victim - just to create some thrill in the movie. There is no originality to it that the bad guy just knows all stuff! In silence of the lambs the bad guy is a skilled psychiatrist who arrives at his detailed conclusions in a rather logical manner - he doesn't just know everything. In Phone booth the bad guy has ""followed"" the victim and gotten to know him through time... well, it's plausible but really irritatingly tiring that that has to be the method of the day to create some excitement. Sadly there are so many other movies where that kinda trick is used, like in an otherwise very good movie like Insomnia - there too is a plausible explanation, but its the same cheap trick! In phone booth tho all that is kinda pushed to the limit. The bad guy is so godlike that he has forseen every little thing... but since that is unrealistic (if for one would have chosen the next possible moment whenever the door was open to run like an idiot into the next building - show over and it'd become a short movie!) the victim has to clearly follow the movie script in order to keep within the limits of what the bad guy could forsee - and that shows! SAD thing.You don't need a new and modern movie to get a similar feeling from a movie. Just watch the classic called ""Rear window"". It's about a billion times better, more thrilling, more hair-raising and will definatly make you chew your nails down to the bone!Phone booth: 4/10",Phone Booth
217,morrowmmm,Enthralling,8,16 August 2003,I guess it is easy to make observations as to plot and what is wrong or bad. The fact is that the film holds you throughout which is a salute to good direction and Colin Farrel is very convincing.,Phone Booth
218,MacTheMovieguy,Don't hang up this phone.,7,12 April 2003,"I must admit that I was skeptic about watching a movie that failed to change locations. Not only that, but I was skeptical about watching a Joel Schumaker movie, since he tends to ruin a large majority of the films he directs. But, I'm happy to report, that Phone Booth surpassed my expectations. The film starts out with some background on our main character Stuart, played wonderfully by Colin Farrell. Stuart, is a cocky New York publicist, who goes to the same phone booth everyday and places a call to his girlfriend (Katie Holmes), at the same time. Of course, this repetitive behavior has made him a prime candidate for a stalker. Today, when Stuart goes to make a call, he won't be able to hang up. Phone Booth was an amazingly well done film, however still flawed. I found it to be interesting, yet predictable. Shocking, yet typical. However, compared to most of the films you could be watching, Phone Booth comes out as a winner.",Phone Booth

Even if the thrills weren't that strong, the plot was still original enough to keep you right in the movie.The only down side, I thought, was the performance of the two women, especially Katie Holmes. She gives an emotional performance equivalent to a hand puppet. I wish I could blame the script or the director, but unfortunately, she's like that in many of her other movies.Whether you think the villain, Sutherland, is crazy or sane in this movie, I think you'll agree he pretty much steals the show - as a character and as an actor.",Phone Booth
220,kmberger,"Great set-up, disappointing finish",6,14 April 2003,"'Phone Booth' was shelved for months in the wake of the sniper attacks in the DC area last year.  Now it's in full release, and since it was made, Colin Farrell has become the hottest thing in Hollywood.  So here's a chance to see a rising star in a film he made before his big breakout.  It's interesting enough for that - and its strong setup - but unfortunately not enough else.The hook for the film is outstanding. Farrell plays Stu Shepard, a conniving press agent who manipulates everyone he knows to get marginal gains.  His phone is his lifeline - it defines him.  Every day, he uses an old-style walk-in phone booth in NYC to call a young ingenue that he's heavily flirting with (played by Katie Holmes).  After making his daily call, the phone rings - it's a man who tells Stu not to hang up, since he's got a rifle aimed right at him.  That's it - the rest of the movie plays off of that tension.The good:  Farrell gives a paper-thin role everything he's got.  Stu is the kind of guy who thinks he's a player, and maybe on some basic level, he is one.  But he's just one of a million faces in New York, and isn't given any depth by this script.  We know he's married (to Radha Mitchell), and for all his sleaziness, apparently hasn't cheated on her. Yet.  But his story is incomplete.  We don't know where Stu comes from, how on earth he got into this situation, or most importantly, why we should care.  Despite all that, Farrell almost pulls it off by portraying Stu's false bravado and quickening panic - it's easy to empathize with his plight.Keifer Sutherland is used brilliantly here as the voice of the sniper.  He has the perfect voice - great pitch, distinctive sound, and puts just the right emphasis on the sinister and the nearly-psychotic.  He's very threatening.  However, the character of the sniper is a problem.  He has way too much information about Stu (from what, bugging the phone booth?  Does he do anything else but follow Stu around?), and is shown as the all-powerful, all-knowing villain who can't be beaten because he sees everything.  Even the cops become wary of him.  A voice like this definitely creates tension - he could do anything! - but there's no rhyme or reason here.  Thin motives are suggested rather than offered - it's clear that this isn't a script designed to get in the head of a sniper, but one designed to make everyone watching nervous as hell.  Does it work?  For a while.  Then it becomes repetitive and even silly.On the downside, we have Forest Whitaker misused as an earnest-beyond-belief policeman who seems to have read the script - he realizes Stu's predicament from what seems to be pure intuition.  Radha Mitchell cares way too much for a guy the movie spends a lot of time turning into a superficial jerk, and Holmes is nothing more than window-dressing.After a promising start, 'Phone Booth' doesn't seem to know where to go.  It gets wrapped up in false finishes and teases, but works itself into a corner, and doesn't seem willing to commit.  If Stu was supposed to be a jerk that gets redeemed, then what's the problem with *really* making him a jerk, and giving this a real payoff when he sees the error of his ways?  If the tension is to pay off, we need to have real emotional investment, and it just isn't there.  Without giving spoilers, there's even a hedging on the sniper himself near the end of the movie, regarding his motivations. 
I would rather have seen this with a tighter script, trimmed down to about 45 minutes, and aired on TV as part of an anthology series.  Whitaker's 'Twilight Zone' would have been a better home for this.  Rating: 6/10, based on the strong hook and the performances of Farrell and Sutherland, who carry the whole film on their backs.",Phone Booth
221,gillman11,Don't even pick up the receiver,3,18 August 2003,"****SPOILER ALERT**** I liked the premise of this film and I'm a big fan of Colin Farrell so I figured I'd check it out, expecting a low key sweaty claustrophobic thriller (from the director of Batman & Robin??? What was I thinking???) The opening sequence gave cause for concern - a flashy CGI intro tracing a signal from the communications satellite down into some guys mobile phone circuitry. All in all it was a disappointment - I never really felt that Stu was in any kind of mortal danger and it really felt like it dragged - quite an achievement for a film only running circa 80 minutes. And just what the hell had Stu done that was so wrong?? He'd lied to a few people in the course of his job and he wanted to sleep with another woman (not just any old woman either - Katie Holmes for Gods sake) - bow down sinners for we are all going to hell!!!",Phone Booth

My heart was pounding the second Colin Farrell picked up the phone and we heard the killer's creepy voice. The story is about an agent named Stu who helps make aspiring actor's famous. Well one day, he takes a wrong turn into a phone booth to call his mistress. Before he has a chance to speak to her, a pizza guy interrups him from dialing, saying someone called him and told him to deliver pizza's to that phone booth. Stu rudely tells him he didn't order pizza's, but gives him money anyway. The pizza guy leaves. He then calls his mistress, but soon after, a madman with a rifle threatens to kill him if he hangs up. Stu dosn't believe him, until a man is shot. Witnesses claim Stu was the killer, and the Sniper says if he tells them the truth he will kill him.  This movie was so scary! The acting was excellent. Colin Ferrall was outstanding, and truly deserves an Academy Award for his role. Every character in the movie acts excellent as well. You get scared of the killer the moment you hear his voice.

226,gimili3979,Phone Booth is one of the best thrillers,9,5 May 2019,"There is something to be said about a movie in a phone booth. In order for it to work and not turn off the audience it is going to rely solely on the dialogue. So what is the movie Phone Booth about? It is about a publicist named Stu Shepherd who finds himself the target of a sniper who chooses victims based on their own indifference towards society. The dialogue is some of the best I have seen acted out in a movie.The tension in this film comes from the fact that nobody other than Stu or the sniper know what is going on. And it is the conversation between Stu and the sniper that makes this one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. For example, there is a bit of dialogue between Stu and the sniper about why killers in the movie never have their guns cocked and ready to go that is just brilliant. The way the sniper taunts Stu over the phone gives the viewer the same sense of isolation as Stu has in the phone booth. The sniper never spoils the situation. He teaches his lessons through action. His victims are forced to be real and genuine with the truth. They have a choice.The film never strays from answering the realistic question of how talking on the phone in a phone booth could be dangerous or how a sniper shooting a gun just has to be noticed on a crowded street full of people. How could anyone set something like this up and make it realistic? It takes on these questions head-on.Other than some unrealistic and risky decisions by the killer at the end of the film, this is truly one of my favorite pieces of movie dialogue. From what I read, the movie is based on a student's short story, but this is not one of these artsy films where there is no action. At only 81 minutes long, the movie flew by. And both Stu and the sniper seemed to have learned from their long conversation.The movie's action and the brilliant and scary delivery of the dialogue will leave you satisfied.",Phone Booth

230,callaway76,Pre-Mature Climax,6,22 July 2003,"The normal mainstream scury of the New York streets gets a rude interruption when a man gets singled out and held hostage in a phone booth by an unknown sniper. It's understandable why this movie was not released on its original date due to sniper shootings in the D.C. Metropolitan area. What I can not understand is why this movie wasn't released on HBO or DVD instead of the big screen.The movie is not horrible, in fact it is well done. Suspenseful with a 'Dog Day Afternoon' humor (and split shots). I just feel that with the extending movie prices (don't make me say I remember when...) the audience should be getting at least 90 minutes of footage, even if it's a 15 minute close-up on Colin's eyebrows. Currently, today's prices cost us a little over ten cents a minute for a 90 minute film. Films such as 'The Pianist' cost about 6 cents/minute. 'Phone Booth' costs us 13 cents a minute to watch and presents no considerable evidence of why we pay extra.There's my rant. Other than that the movie hits home to many I'm sure, though I never have been appreciative of 'the bad guy teaching us good morals' plot, the falicy lies there within. The movie's main focus is the 'what would you do' factor in which the newest Ausie Sex Idol, Colin Farrell delivers an amazingly emotional performance. There are tense moments abound as the swat team surrounds the area and constantly cocks their guns (ironic to the caller's earlier statement). However, the final confrontation comes unexpectedly and fizzles off to the credits too soon, there was plenty of room for more movie (even if just a close-up of Colin for the ladies). The split scenes as well were random, distracting, and no help to the mood of the movie.Bottom Line: Sorry to those who saw it at the theaters, maybe worth renting, but better when it comes to cable. Good movie for the short attention spanned ADD television addicts.",Phone Booth

Stu Shepard is a successful publicist who works the job of deceit living with it all in complete comfort disregarding those who are not valuable to his wallet and style. On a very well moving day, a trip to the nearest phone booth becomes a tiring battle for survival as he is held hostage by an anonymous sniper with the intent of punishing him for his sins and endless roads of lies. Collin Farrell leads the scene away into movie in his most groundbreaking performance to date, along with a great matching supporting cast of likeables such as `Forest Whitaker' and the chilling `Mr. Kiefer Sutherland'. `Phone Booth' is almost as good as the tension can get these days with Hollywood rapping up any half decent story they can find and throwing it at us with the hope that we'll actually pay to go see it. Fortunately, for us all, and with my intentions of laying my cards on the table, this is not one for those films. It is mind-teasing break into the world of suspense using very crafty plotting and camera work. Director Joel Schumacher has finally struck gold in this modern piece of entertainment by involving us into the feelings of the movies protagonist. We get our grins and edge of our seat moments by really beginning to care for our character and the ordeal he is going through. The whole movie gives a great sense of real time clockwork that adds up to the whole thing as the audience is thrown in to the situation of the whole `gun-point' scenario with great front row tickets. Topping it off with a cute twist along with a neat non-stretched time frame and were given a satisfying piece of filmmaking that's not attempting to be more than it is. `Phone Booth' gives us all the goods and I like the fact that you don't really have to go looking for something personally entertaining when you watch it. Sit back and enjoy the flick because finding a movie these days that really does put you on the edge of your seat almost throughout the complete feature time is pretty darn hard to dig up.",Phone Booth
234,Schnayblay,A Unique Thriller That Would've Fallen Into Mediocrity Had It Not Been for Collin Farrel and Kiefer Sutherland,8,30 July 2012,"I had been told that ""Phone Booth"" was a movie I just had to see. It had been shoved down my throat so much, I almost didn't want to see it for a while. But when I finally saw a copy for rent, I didn't hesitate to grab it and finally see what I had been missing out on. And I have definitely been missing out.""Phone Booth"" is about Stu Sheppard, a Public Relations agent who is the smoothest in his business. He knows exactly how to pull everyone's strings and how to work his way around everything. But everything comes crashing down on him one day when he picks the wrong phone booth, and now he's being held captive inside the booth by a sniper who want's Stu to be punished. Now, Stu must find a way out of this crazy hostage situation without getting himself or his loved ones killed. It's a simple and also very clever premise, and those are always some of the smarter ones in my opinion.Collin Farrell headlines as Stu, the suave businessman who knows all the tricks. Within five minutes, we know this character and you're laughing along with how well this guy can play people. He's a master of lies and you love to watch him work his art. The only thing that sucks is that it's confined to the first five minutes of the movie. After that, he becomes a nervous and frantic wreck. Collin Farrell completely knew how to do this character, and this is my favorite performance I've seen him do yet, aside from Bullseye in ""Daredevil"". But this truly is Collin's film and he carries the entire thing. He really gets to shine, and I find it kind of sad that he hasn't gotten the status I think he deserves until now, with him starring in the remake of ""Total Recall"".Kiefer Sutherland plays the anonymous sniper holding Stu captive. He talks to Stu through the phone the whole movie, and he has such a smooth and villainous voice. He's one of those classy, intelligent villains that have thought of every scenario and are completely in charge. Those are the villains that I find really intimidating and intriguing. Another great thing about the sniper is you don't know his motivation for doing this. It gives him a good level of mystery that really makes you think during the film.Katie Holmes and Forest Whitaker are also in this movie. Katie Holmes plays Kim, a client of Stu's, who Stu wants to sleep with. Her character could've been played by anyone else, because she only gets about three minutes of screen time, but I guess the studio figured they needed more big names in the movie. And that's also where Forest Whitaker comes in. He plays a police captain. Nothing special here at all. Shallow, uninteresting, and I really don't care about him at all. There's also a younger Richard T. Jones in the movie as a cop. I will never forget him as Agent Ellison from ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"". Just a funny little side note.""Phone Booth"" is a great thriller. While some audiences may think that the whole thing being confined to one space is a negative, in my opinion, it's the most wonderful thing about the film and really helps the film have it's unique place in cinema history. The film is well paced and well-acted, with a sinister villain and a great lead. It's not even an hour and a half, but I don't think the writer could have put anything more into the film than there is without making it feel like there's too much going on. The film is a great time and I will definitely be buying it.",Phone Booth
235,jryan-4,let it ring,6,16 July 2003,"What is the why in this film? Why exactly does the voice of Kiefer Sutherland want to humiliate and murder Stu? Why does the negotiator have to tell us about his intimacy problems and why does he have them? Why do the two negotiators seemingly hate each other so intently. What's the story with the pizza guy or da pimp or da hose or da intern or da wife or da mistress or anybody or anything in this film up to and including the ""ending"".   So much back story has been left out of this film that yes we sadly do end up with ninety one minutes of a guy in a phone booth along with the truly irritating why.....why has the backstory of my life led me to place where i can waste an hour and a half watching an actor playing a guy sweating out his transgressions in a phone booth. Six is generous for this rip-off. Furthermore,I don't feel a need to answer the phone every time it rings and if this film calls I advise everyone do not answer.",Phone Booth
236,vivalarsx,Not a Wasted Second,8,18 April 2003,"**WARNING:  SPOILERS (FOR A DIFFERENT MOVIE): The best thing about Phone Booth is its brevity.  It is a short movie, but in this case, ""short"" translates as succinct, to the point.  There really isn't a wasted second.  As characters are introduced, we are given a very shorthand version of their personalities and their place in this particular tale (though it is amazing how intricately cult screenwriter Larry Cohen manages to work in threads of their pasts in order to give us a fuller view of the person).  I saw this two days after seeing The Core, and it is interesting to compare the two.  The Core, while fun-ish, is really a bloated and overloaded contraption with one crucial flaw:  the crisis gets solved, but the movie doesn't end.  When the earth-drilling vessel ended up trapped on the ocean floor, the movie just stopped cold; the crisis was over, why add an anti-climax?  Phone Booth, on the other hand, gets to its point, and then--bam, bam, bam!--the plot just catapults along, the central issue gets resolved (I won't say how), and the movie is over.  It's so quick even uber-hack Joel Schumacher doesn't have a chance to destroy it.  What a fun movie; it moves so fast, it's embarrassingly bracing.",Phone Booth

OK, the story is horrible, fine. OK, Colin Farrell does one of the worst accents ever, fine, OK, nobody else in the film gives an even remotely realistic performance, fine. All of these things on their own would make this a bad film. But put them all together, they make the dumbest movie ever formed. This unrealistic guy gets a phone call in a telephone booth. he answers it for some dumb reason. He carries on an inane conversation with an all-knowing voice that can do magic. Meanwhile, characters that portray the most ridiculous stereotypes ever introduced on the screen pester him. It is as if a 7th grader wrote it, a 7th grader with a limited education. Man, I don't know what to say, this is acting and writing at its worst. Just thinking of this film makes me want to puke. 0 out of ****.",Phone Booth
238,deltajuliet,One of the greatest thrillers ever made: Farrell's best,10,2 March 2006,"Phone BoothI don't care much for superlatives, but this is one of the best thrillers ever made, if not ""the"" best.The simple plot of a man held hostage in a phone booth by a sniper seems a bit dry in retrospect, but the duo of Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland dazzle the screen with a fiery electricity that burns throughout the film.Director Joel Schumacher uses bits of flashy camera-work here and there, but in no way does the film try to rely on it. No, the film is fully supported by the engaging dialogue and Oscar-worthy acting. Colin Farrell graces the screen with his finest performance, nearly bringing tears to me at one point. His performance is the best of the film, his career, and in my opinion, of the last several years.Still, Sutherland works wonders in his seemingly limited role. He doesn't in any way get tied down by not being seen. In fact, it's as though he took the quality from his acting and added it to his dialogue to make some sort of super-hybrid voice. Listening to him is mesmerizing, and Sutherland and Farrell play off each other so extremely well.Forest Whitaker also provides a solid performance, one of his best. Still, the bulk of the kudos go to Sutherland and (mostly) Farrell; again, this is easily Farrell's best performance, and he gives any other actor in any other movie ever made a run for their money.If you are a Sutherland fan, a Farrell fan, a thriller fan, I strongly encourage you to see this movie. If you are not.... I still strongly encourage you to see this movie. Be ready for some profanity, but also be ready for a thriller that puts all others to shame.",Phone Booth

242,quincy-white,Intense,8,30 April 2003,"Al Pacino is one of the actors Colin Farrell is often compared to, so it is appropriate that Phone Booth remind me so much of Dog Day Afternoon.  In both cases, we see a man break down over the course of a really difficult day.  Phone Booth takes things a step further by having events occur in real time.Farrell is awesome, particularly in the end, revealing complete vulnerability.  Keifer Sutherland's voice also adds a great performance. He is just as apt playing the bad guy in this as he is playing the hero of 24. His motive in the end is better than the usual 'I'm someone you barely remember from your past.'Joel Schumacer does a good job directing, keeping the intensity up.  In my book at least, he has finally lifted the stigma attached to him since Batman and Robin.One final note:  I really enjoyed the mean hookers, a nice break from all those prostitutes with hearts of gold.",Phone Booth
243,what3v3r,Gosh! And 10 days was all it took to be filmed!!,9,19 April 2005,"Colin Farrell is a self-professed star publicist with an attitude to boot. Watch 81 minutes of gut-wrenching nerve-wracking dialog reduce a pretentious ""kiss my ass"" punk into an enervated and regretful reprobate. Farrell is simply awesome in portraying the gravity of the situation. ""The Caller""'s voice is absolutely worth a mention. Calm, creepy and authoritative! Something different and the movie would have fallen flat on its 'flab less' anterior. Sutherland plays 'The Caller', manning a high profile sniper rifle, while he thrusts honesty upon Stu Shephard (Colin Farrell). Frankly, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen for a second. Ebert himself was marvelled by the creativity of ""Phone Booth"". Why! It wasn't without good reason! A gaudy character stuck inside a phone booth in a busy locale, some good camera work, bunch of apartment windows, a psycho sniper and 10 days of excellent filming supported by a 'worth a mention' cast easily will manage to get into a good bundle of ""top ten"" lists. Fabulous entertainment and a good display of creativity. Graham Bell is still aiding marvels, I guess!",Phone Booth

I have to say that I have, like I always do, read up on some of the comments on Rottentomatoes and I was really surprised that the fresh rating wasn't higher.  I tried my very best to avoid all the trailers and radio spots just cause I knew this movie was short and I didn't want to get too much just from that.  And, when I finally got the chance to actually see this movie (yesterday) was was blown away.  I thought it was amazing.  I thought Colin Farrell was phenomenal (I really give propers for folks who have thick accents that take on different ones for their roles: Rene Zellweger in Bridget Jones, Nicole Kidman in a handful of movies, and Colin over and over).So there isn't much to add to the trailer though.  A guy picks up the phone in a booth in Manhattan and it turns out to be a twisted killer who is picking people who are jerks and tries to make them better.  Nothing like using a little bit of scare tactics to get your point across.  I tell you I would love to see how the whole thing changes Stew.  Can he change?  Who knows.  I know that I'm never gonna pick up a ringing phone.In its simplicity, Phone Booth really has a lot going on.  Its got one setting, a handful of characters, and lots of action and drama for an 81 minute long movie.  I say, Thumbs up!",Phone Booth
245,JessicaBrandy,Good evening...do do do do do do do,10,10 July 2003,"Phone booth was one of those movies where I really felt that all is not totally lost when it comes to new movie making.  Now I realize that this is no original idea, Hitchcock wanted to make a movie like this in the past but funny enough, was unable to come up with a reason to have the main character have to stay in a phone booth.  Well, even though the reason used in this movie isn't one to gasp at, I still found myself enjoying the suspense, drama and thrill. A jerky agent has finally met his match when a man with a I-have-to-punish-people attitude, not unlike Mr. Nameless from Se7en, targets him while making his daily call to a promising mistress in a phone booth.
I liked Phone Booth a lot.  It was super suspenseful, and if your one for 2nd chances then you will surely find yourself rooting for Stu (Colin Farrell).  Forest Whitaker played an awesome Captain that tried his best to understand the situation and not just jump to conclusions even with adversity.
Colin Farrell has been someone I've been keeping a look out for ever since Tigerland, and he's done nothing but please the mind and eye (even in my guilty little pleasure DareDevil).  The only thing that I will askno, not ask, beg of HollywoodPLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT MAKE A SEQUAL.  The end is fine, we do not need to see what will happen to our characters.  Just leave it as it is.  With that said, I bid you all adu.",Phone Booth

If he wanted to make a heart change of Stu, why he had to kill two innocent people? This is somewhat akin to movie ""the Game"" I saw on video last weekend.But still, the movie has sufficient thrill to keep you on edge seat for 1 hour. Another thing I could not understand was if Stu was inside glass booth, the red dot should pass through glass. As a result, there should be offset in position. So we should be able to see two dots. One on glass, another on his body.",Phone Booth

The stroyline is quite simple. A rich smart- looking man named Stuart Shepard who answers a ringing pay phone in New York, and on the phone is a sniper who tells Stuart that he'll kill him if he hangs up. The sniper can see him and he knows everything that Stuart is doing. Police and newscrew come. This film is great! Great acting, great plot,great actors, and great cast. The film wasn't long but it packed so much into it. This film is also tense and exciting, I enjoyed all of it. The film's ending was great too! I'm writing this review a day after I watched it. I was so eager to write a review. But I can't decide whether this is a 4-star film or a 5-star film. But this film is dam thrilling and great!",Phone Booth
250,basemnt-dwellr,Great Film,8,30 April 2003,"I just watched phone booth and I found it really exciting. During the whole movie I wanted to know what would happen next, in what kind of situations the sniper would put Stu Shepard next. First, Stu only has to somehow send away the hooker who needs to make a phone call. Then he has to deal with her friends, then with the pimp who wants to beat him up with a baseball bat, finally it's the police, so it's getting worse and worse.Colin Farrell really does a fantastic job here, he is really convincing as the man in distress. He goes through a whole lot of emotions from being arrogant till breaking down in tears, and you really believe him. Although Stu is not a very likeable character, you can imagine how he must feel being trapped in this phone booth and you start rooting for him. Also the other actors are first class. Kiefer Sutherland's calm and controlled voice (as the sniper) is quite eerie and makes a good counterpart to Colin Farrell's character, who after having spent quite a while in this phone booth is totally stressed out.The cinematography is also great. I mean, what can you do when a movie is shot in only one place, namely a phone booth? So when Stu is making his phone calls with his mobile phone, the picture gets divided so that you can see him and also the people he is talking to.The film was shot for about 13 million Dollars, but you don't see it. There are no special effects and stuff, but you don't miss them at all. The whole atmosphere of the movie is so enthralling that it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Definitely worth watching.",Phone Booth

The psychopath manipulates Colin Farrel into confessing some of his 'sins' to his wife and public. Eventually, the police get involved and news people show up as would be expected. The police are under the impression that Colin Farrel is the bad guy at first but figure out there's someone else involved. It was interesting that we don't see the psychopath until the very end of the movie. I was disappointed by the use of the warn out cliche of two police detectives with different ranks clashing. On the positive side, there were some good twists and turns that set it apart from similar movies, but not enough tension and originality to give it more than 7/10.",Phone Booth
252,kat_777,Best message in a movie ever!!! (especially for this generation),8,15 August 2012,"DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILMI saw phone booth in bits and pieces, whenever it came on star movies. I became curious. My mom always commented about the intensity and Suspense this movie was bringing up. So my dad and I bought the DVD Later. Dad was reluctant to buy it because; it was a onetime watch. Then I finally saw the film a lot later. The movie was fantastic in a way, because of its message, which is completely necessary for the present generation. That is ""Don't you dare cheat on your Partners/spouses. Especially if he/she loves you madly"" I felt like applauding at this idea. This film was about a man, a Publicist names Stu Sheppard (Colin Farrell) who makes up a life by Selling out lies. He keeps mentioning that he has world famous actors For friends and keeps lying to colleagues and add more lies to hide the Others. Thus he looks pretty cool, rich and expensive before everyone that even his assistant wanted to step into his shoes. The worst part of his life is that he is an having an affair with another woman and the fact that he is married is unknown to her. Things were going as he wanted until he answered the phone that rang in a booth where he always visited to call his girlfriend Pam(Katie Holmes).The caller(Kiefer Sutherland) puts him in a position where he has to offer special obligation for Stu to even breath normally.The movie is unique in every way. I didn't feel like getting up even for a second until the movie was over. It has the suspense that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The movie takes place within a single locality so literally I am not surprised that they have managed to finish the whole thing within just 12 days. I even wondered if Colin Farrell got tired of standing the whole time. It was pretty confusing on whether the caller was really a super villain. He is and he is not. He is because he caused a lot of problem to the people, police and damaged the property. He killed the pizza guy at the end. He is not a super villain because in a way Stu deserves what he got. He was lying to everyone about him, especially his poor wife and girlfriend, so this caller whoever he is cured him of this weakness. And the people this man killed like the pedophile and the business man deserves to die. Then there is Leon, he deserves what he got as he was a pimp.I was not happy with the fact that there was too much swear words used though. But yeah i am pretty this film will highlight on how terrible it is to be in the big circle of lies.Joel Schumacher's direction was really nice. He had a nice vision about the whole thing. He managed to show the seriousness of the situation. I can't imagine anyone other than Colin Farrell in the place of Stu Shepard, the guy who initially shows off and then falls on his knees begging. He has a great talent and should actually do better films than substandard ones like Alexander, Swat etc. Forrest Whitaker shines really well as a frustrated police officer who himself went through a divorce. This was the movie where I actually started noticing him followed by panic room. Radha Mitchelle's character was very nice as Stu's wife. She loved him so much that she had absolutely no hesitation in forgiving Stu for cheating on her. She was also worried about him during the whole episode. Katie perhaps became famous after phone booth. The real crown was Kiefer Sutherland's voice. My dad and I were confused on who's voice was the best among Kiefer Sutherlan, Liam Neeson, Sam Worthington, Morgan Freeman and Harrison Ford.He had the creepiness, the humor and evilness in his voice as he talked thought the phone. He performed basically with his voice alone. He hardly appeared for three minutes at the end. That is another attraction of this film.I hear mixed reviews, Some find this film silly, other stupid, some say that it is epic, then some loves this film. My best suggestion is that it is definitely worth a watch. You will be in the edge of your seat. Afterall it highlights a good message on relationship with your spouse.",Phone Booth

254,jerrywilson,Left me wondering what happened to the rest of the flick,6,6 April 2003,"I like Colin Farrell. And he didn't disappoint me by his performance in this film. But when the entire movie takes place in and around a NY City phone booth, there's only so much one can accomplish with good acting alone.We got to know Farrell's character, Stu Shepard, pretty well. But what about the caller, voiced by Kiefer Sutherland? Sutherland appeared as a character for only about 30 seconds of the movie. And except for some vague clue that he's a deranged psycho who sits in his NY window and watches the phone booth from his perch every day, getting to know the people who frequent it, we haven't a clue as to what drives this character. What was his real motive?I also thought the ending was shallow. It left me scratching my head and wondering where the rest of the movie went.My most fervent complaint about most movies is that they are too long. It is unusual that a director can't tell his story in under two hours, so if a movie goes much beyond that, it invariably has far too many superfluous elements. Not so with Phone Booth. It lasted only 80 minutes and could have benefitted from the addition of a couple of intriguing sub-plots.But alas, it had but a single, shallow story line. And it played out much the way you might expect it to if you were watching it on CNN. Yes, it was a morality play, and yes it was successful in bringing out the ""real"" Stu Shepard. But it amounted to nothing more than a short film that was drawn out to almost feature length without the addition of any plot elements to justify its increased length.I gave it a 6.",Phone Booth
255,fcasnette,interesting let down,5,21 May 2006,"Do not read if you have not seen this movie! Interesting failure let down by plot failures: For me the voice of the sniper was so obviously added in a sound studio after the movie was finished it spoilt the whole suspension of disbelief, he was supposed to be at the end of that phone line after all.The Farrell character's redemption at the end did nothing for me, he was such a sleaze-bag you did not really feel any empathy or sympathy for him.The sniper was far too God like through the first 90% of the movie, a common failing in Hollywood. He knew everything about Farrell's life, he was an expert marksman, he was an electronics bugging expert, he was a phone system expert so his calls are untraceable, he was an expert at predicting police tactics etc etc etc... and then lets himself be found just at the right time in the plot by previously phoning a traceable call from the apartment which is to be the scene of his crimes.The ending was a cop out, I saw the pizza guy denouement a mile off without seeing any reviews or hints, who kills themselves by hacking through their own throats when police are running up the stairs outside the door and you have a gun available?

257,WriConsult,Moving and gripping ...,8,7 August 2003,"A few flaws, including the introductory voiceover and a couple of minor and fleeting lapses in plausibility that don't affect the overall premise or plotline.  Biggest problem for me, though, was the use of fast motion (not time lapse, which can be OK) in a couple of instances.  To me, fast motion is unacceptable in a quality film, but at least the sequences were short enough not to kill the buzz.(Unlike others, I'm not bothered by the cops discussing the wiretaps though - c'mon guys, it's a standard plot device.  Get over it.)That aside, it's very well scripted and acted.  I thought that for the most part Farrell played his character perfectly, including the obnoxious jerk at the beginning and the somewhat altered character later in the film. Powerful stuff.  I was absolutely gripped and at the edge of my seat, which doesn't happen on my couch cushions very often.  Not groundbreakingly original, but still quite fresh and no one is just going through the motions here.  A good story, well told.  What else do you want?Ordinarily, I would not be able to rate this movie movie any higher than 7/10 due to the flaws mentioned above.  But because of how exceptionally well it grabbed me personally (which is absolutely THE primary reason a movie in this genre should exist) I'm bumping my rating up to 8/10.",Phone Booth
258,Mappyman,Ring Ring Ring Bananaphone,8,2 January 2005,"Story: 8/10 Very good. Also very simple. A sniper calls a phone booth he watched and stalked for quite awhile so he knows what he's doing. This isn't your typical ""Whats your favorite scary movie"" type killer/caller. He loves to mind f*ck the guy too, which is just eerie! The victim, Stu also has his own mess of troubles and turns out being a lot less than he shows off to be.Acting: 9/10 Strong! At first Stu could give a crap about everything but ends up going near insane with anger and confusion and most of all fear of getting himself and everyone else killed by the sniper/stalker. The police chief also does very well in playing out the concerned role. I guess Stus girlfriend(s) would kind of count off on this.Sound Mix: 8/10 Sniper loads his rifle ""KA- CHUNK!!!"", heart beat ""Thump thump thump"".... its very gripping. you'll jump when he actually shoots something. you wont expect it at all.Camera-work / Lighting: 10/10 As measly as it sounds, there's only one REAL location; the phone booth. but oh so many angles and shots you can have on it. All of the camera-work was brilliant in this. Itll cause fear because you're not sure where in New York he could be hiding. Anywhere, and the camera swerves to show the excitement. During all of the intense scenes, the camera almost works like something on Cops with swerving and uneasiness all over the place. It really sets the mood.Editing: 8/10 Great. Going back from the plans the police force has to find out what the hell is going on with the phone call, to Stuwart stuck in the booth with no way of hanging up without getting shot, to the killer's sight scope dancing around with the red pointer laser aimed at people's heads.Uniqueness: 8/10 If anything Scream had a similar concept with phone stalker/killers but this really intensifies it. Being able to mind f*ck a guy into confessing everything he's done wrong in his life to save the lives of his loved ones; or watch them die... you don't see that very much.Worth: 9/10 Watch this! Its definitely a movie that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, trying to figure a way he can escape the sniper and the police and make it out alive with his balls intact. The movie is a bit short tho.Synopsis: A slick weasely New York publicist Stu gets a call in a phone booth (after he calls his cheating new girlfriend) is told that if he hangs up, he'll be killed... and the little red light from a laser rifle sight is proof that the caller isn't kidding. Any attempt he makes to outsmart the sniper ends up getting other people in the mix. Not even the police can help him.Overall Score (Not an average): 9.0 The movie definitely has a lot of grip to it. Something you'll be afraid to take a bathroom break through if you're at the theater because you might miss another sniping or chance/attempt for the guy to escape the booth. Reviewer's Insight: Get your Jujubees and Popcorn before the movie! missing one minute of this hour, 45 min movie could mean the end of somebody! The voice of the sniper is definitely much more freakier than the Reaper on Scream and boy does he know how to mess with this guy's mind. Heh, he makes him ask the police chief if he jerks off. That or sniper guy blows his head off. Wow!",Phone Booth

260,driffma,This is an excellent thriller,10,28 May 2003,"Joel Schumacher directed Phone Booth, but don't let that scare you away. It is true he has made some truly awful films.  Batman and Robin, Dying Young, 8mm,and Bad Company are just a few that spring to mind.  But occasionally he forgets his track record of pure drivel and makes excellent movies.  This is the director after all who gave us such fun fare as, Lost Boys, Flatliners, Falling Down, and the compelling Tigerland.  In between his attempts at excellence, and his successful forays into brain-dead filmmaking sits much that is mediocre.Phone Booth, is one Schumacher can happily add to his not crap efforts. I think this is very nearly a perfect thriller.  I say nearly because the antagonist is, maybe, just a bit too perfect.  That is a minor complaint though.  Moreover Kiefer Sutherland's performance makes the complaint one all too easy to ignore.Phone Booth tells the unhappy story of Stuart `Stu' Shepherd, an unlikable, cynical, small time publicist with big time ambition.  His chief skill as a publicist is his ability to lie.  It also seems to be his chief skill in most other areas of his life.  As the film opens we see him working his gift to everybody, his assistant, his clients and to various magazine personnel. The sad thing is that he is really good at his job.  And we in the audience think it is pretty cool the way he wheels and deals to achieve his ends. Every day at lunch he goes to a specific phone booth, on a specific corner, in New York City.  He has a cell phone, but he needs this booth.  From this booth he calls a woman with whom he is quite taken.  That is why he calls from the booth, to avoid any dangerous questions his wife might have about certain recurring phone numbers on his cell.  As he is leaving the booth, the phone begins to ring.  He does what many of us would do and picks it up. What happens after that I will not say.  I worry I have revealed too much as it is.Phone Booth is a slick movie with a lot of substance.  Its script is all wit and anger.  This is an angry movie.  It is critical and observant and I hope some of the laughter it generates is uneasy.  That rifle is pointing at the viewer as much as it is pointing at Colin Farrell's lying cynic.  But the movie succeeds in doing what I thought would be impossible.  It keeps the tension up.  Maybe that is not so impressive.  There are a lot of tense, thrilling movies out there.  But how many of those movies take place in a phone booth?If the script is good, then a movie like this hinges on the talent of its actors.  Colin Farrell is up to the challenge.  He plays Stu Shepherd perfectly.  This is a complex character, not exactly good and not exactly bad (pay close attention to his rationale for even being in the phone booth).  Fear is the big thing we need to see in a performance like this. Big old believable fear.  And Farrell delivers.  The other big performance has to come from `the caller'.  `The Caller' is just a voice on a phone. Kiefer Sutherland has the perfect voice, the perfect delivery.  We never see him but because of his skill we don't need to.  We know what he looks like. We can hear everything in his voice.The supporting cast pushes this film over the top.  While their parts are certainly much smaller, Forest Whitaker, Richard T. Jones, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes give performances that help ground the experience in reality. My verdict, this one's a 10.  Go forth and enjoy!",Phone Booth
261,mjg32,excellent thriller crammed into a nice little package,6,18 March 2007,"Phone Booth manages to put pretty much everything you want into a thriller in a short space of time. It is a thoroughly original idea - a publicist, who has been lying his way to success, is held inside the phone booth he has been using to cheat on his wife by an unseen sniper on the other end of the line, who wants him to confess to his wife. It is very well acted, with Colin Farrell portraying the desperation of his character really well, while Kiefer Sutherland, while only seen for a few seconds, plays ""The Caller"" very well. His character is a very good and original one, as while he does kill innocent people without remorse, his real victims are chosen well. He uses threat to try and force them to come clean, and stop cheating in life. It is one of the few films where you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. His voice on the phone is also chillingly brilliant. Without that voice, the film wouldn't be nearly as effective in achieving the suspense generated. Forrest Whitaker also puts in a nice performance as the detective trying to resolve the situation.The camera-work is also fantastic. The shots rotating 360 degrees, looking up at the tall buildings give you a feeling of claustrophobia, like you are also stuck in the phone booth with Stu. Interesting dialogue, a thrilling situation, a couple of nice twists and a completely fresh idea make this a top film, and is one of Joel Schumacher's best achievements.",Phone Booth
262,gvf,Awesome!!!,9,13 January 2005,"I had thought about renting this movie for some time but never got around doing it until now. As some of you may know, Colin Ferrell is scheduled to play no other than Detective James ""Sonny"" Crockett in an upcoming big-screen adaption of the 80s cult TV show ""Miami Vice""-- potential sacrilegy for die-hard ""vice"" fans like me who would be more than happy to see Don Johnson take up his old role again. So my objective here was to see whether Colin Ferrell is ""worthy"" at all to begin with - but I got lots more than I had bargained for :-))**spoilers** At a first glance, the premise of this film may not look like something you can wrap a good thrilling story around - Stu Shepard (Colin Ferrell), a young, slick, self-absorbed, narcissistic, uppity (insert similar pejorative expressions here) PR agent answers a coincidental phone call in a phone booth, only to find out that there's a sniper on the other end who is pointing his rifle at him from one of the countless windows on 53rd street in NYC. The sniper threatens to kill him if he doesn't do exactly as he says.But from then on, the movie evolves into an an all-out, edge-of-your-seat, mind-blowing thriller. It turns out the sniper has been watching him for some time. Stu uses the same (bugged) phone booth every day to call his ""make-out interest"" so his endearing, unsuspecting wife won't find out through his cell phone bills that he is cheating on her. Stu suddenly has to realize that the sniper is for real when he shoots and kills one of the disgruntled bystanders who want to use the phone. Police rush to the scene because everybody thinks Stu did it. The whole thing turns into a real spectacular when news people and bystanders (as well as Stu's wife and his ""girlfriend"") gather around, and the sniper really gets into the game of pushing Stu's buttons and having his way with him, the whole time threatening to kill him if he doesn't obey him (in Germany, this movie is aptly titled ""Don't hang up"" for this).The film really is somewhat innovative in its own right: An entire movie shot from the inside and outside of a downtown telephone booth, creating an air of fear, paranoia and suspense that will keep you glued to your seat until the final minute (and you'll be rewarded with quite a twist at the very end, which really puts the film right up there with some of Hollywood's all-time thriller masterpieces!! If Hitchcock wasn't dead, I'd seriously wonder if he masterminded this movie!).Much more can be said about the many different aspects of this film (such as the morality play of Stu being forced by the sniper to spill his own sinful guts in front of his two women and rolling cameras)... but that is for you to find out as you go and rent/buy ""Phone Booth"" - you'll definitely enjoy it! And if you're anything like me, you may even feel a bit uneasy the next time you use a phone booth ;-)As for Colin Ferrell, now that I've been able to witness his way-above-average acting talent, I'm comfortable knowing that he'll be chasing bad guys through Miami next summer! My vote: 9 out of 10 phone booths",Phone Booth

Kiefer's voice is recognisable and convincing. Camera angles show the real panic in Kolin's eyes. Second roles augment the effect.This movie kept me going... And when it was over, i felt a little bit disapointed because it was only around 80 minutes.Nevertheless!!! The whole movie provides opportunities for a sequel, something new...

267,ninja_superstar-1,This film accomplishes all that it can.,7,23 April 2005,"There are only two things that this film has to do to keep its audience's attention: 1) Make the audience believe that a man has trapped another man in a phone booth with the threat of death, and 2) create a victimized character that the audience sympathizes with. With these forces in place, the audience is mostly (not entirely, of course) distracted from the film's ridiculousness. The rest of the film writes itself, and the dialogue is fairly believable.Keifer Sutherland phones in a decent voice performance, and Colin Ferrell is quite convincing as the emotionally wrought man trapped in the phone booth. Forrest Whittaker is not challenged by his role, and so plays the straight man as only a veteran actor can.The film is essentially a one-act morality play staged in an urban landscape and with modern props. Yet the behaviors the film wishes to correct are as old as human existence.",Phone Booth
268,Bobzilla85,Excellent Thriller.,10,16 April 2003,"Although some have ridiculed this film for being too long, or too rushed, or the fact the characters arent given much time to develop, I must disagree whole heartedly.  This film is about a straightforward situation:  a man enters a phone booth, and is held hostage by the scope of a sniper. Thats all you need to know, for that is the essence of the film.  Character development is a great plus, and I could feel for Farrel because he MADE the character of Stu.  Sutherland is great as the omnipotent, psychotic caller on the other end of the line, and Whitaker gives a great preformance as the cool-headed policeman in charge.  As for the pace of the film, Schumacher actually manages to make a good film in this case, it is neither too fast nor too slow.  You can feel the tension throughout the whole 81 minutes, and the story works perfectly.  I also loved the twist at the end of the story (warning - SPOILER! Do not read ahead if you dont want the end to be spoiled for you) in the fact that Sutherland escapes to continue on his self-richeous snipering spree, he planned ahead for everything.  I was afraid of him in the same manner I feared Hannibal Lecter at the end of Silence of the Lambs.
Of course there were some plot holes or points in the movie that could have been done better, but thats to be expected in any film.  All in all, this is an extremely well put together film, and I highly recommend for all prospective viewers to go out and see the film for themselves, on its on merits, rather than the views of a few on this board who dislike the film.8.5/10",Phone Booth
269,MadiZone,Thrilling!,9,5 June 2003,"This movie is a thriller, whose job is to thrill, and it is thrilling because I was thrilled. Picture a random person, filmed while talking in a phonebooth for over an hour. Sounds boring, doesn't it? Sounds like your mom or your wife, doesn't it? Well - this is the exception. It's about 80 minutes of razorsharp thrilling. The movie evolves around Stu, a young publicist who is lying to himself, his clients, his wife and his mistress. A random day in his life, he is doing a phonecall from Manhattens last phonebooth to his mistress, just after hanging up the phone rings. Voice is calling him. Voice wants him to confess, confess his sins. If not, Stu will be a dead man. Voice is sitting somewhere in a building near stu, pointing a telescope rifle at Stu. Obey or die - it's as simple as that. The movie will keep you stuck to the screen every minute. It's not predictable, it's not something seen before.Watch it - it's thrilling.",Phone Booth
270,ChrisMIN43211,Worthy of the hype,7,18 June 2003,"At the beginning of Phone Booth, it is mentioned that the particular phone booth of the title is set to be removed. After all, in the city of New York, millions of people use cell phones.One of them, Stu, played by Colin Farrell, seems to live and die by his up and down the streets of Manhattan.  In his everyday routine, though, Stu stops to make a call to a young woman(Katie Holmes) who isn't his wife from the phone booth; there is a reason for that.After refusing a from-out-of-nowhere pizza that he didn't ask for, Stu answers the call that will change his life. Still in the phone booth, a stranger on the other end of the line informs Stu he will be shot to death if he leaves and/or hangs up.And so finally, we get the performance from Colin Farrell that is worthy of the hype that surrounded Phone Booth, whose release was delayed due to the sniper shootings in the fall of 2002. The similarities to the shootings and this movie, whatever they may be are purely coincidental. If anything, a man stuck in a phone booth with a police force AND the sniper(a very creepy sounding Keifer Sutherland) is like a blip on a screen compared to the real-life sniper shootings.While I recommend Phone Booth for its use of split screens to illustrate phone conversations, the ending bothered me slightly.",Phone Booth
271,saska-3,Not so much wrong as not right...,6,27 July 2003,"PHONE BOOTH is an interesting film-school exercise adapted for the big screen with a big star.  Its short running time is merciful, although my complaint is not with the performance of Farrell, who is required to carry the movie entirely on his shoulders and manages admirably.My major issue is that the film's hook - that of spending 84 minutes watching Stu talking on the phone with a madman - calls for irritating split-screen and picture-in-picture execution, which is used continuously until we're accustomed to it. Then, for no reason that I can discern, the director abandons the device for long stretches of time - 45 seconds, a minute - during which the protagonist, as near as I can tell, does nothing.I could overlook how fast and loose the story plays with police procedure (no photographs taken of a body at the scene before it's carted off in a coroner's van, for example), but not how fast and loose it plays with its own supposed theme.  (Potential spoilers follow.)  We are supposed to believe that Stu is in the same league with other victims of this sniper, who seem to have deserved their executions; however, Stu is neither so nice as to gain our sympathy nor so bad as to deserve what he's getting.  The point of the film, therefore, seems to be that ""everyone is guilty of something and will hate themselves for it if enough pressure is applied."" I'm not sure I needed to spend 84 minutes of my life being told that.This may be worth watching for Farrell's performance, depending upon whether you're a fan, but I don't recommend it as a great film. 6/10.",Phone Booth
272,Rash,Don't answer the damned thing then!,8,25 November 2004,"Just to start off, I thought this movie was very good. Good acting, good plot, some suspense (which is nice in a suspense movie). Probably Colin Farrell's finest moment. There wasn't any single actor (apart from Farrell of course) who tried to overdo their part and take away the focus from the situation at hand.Its a story about morals and trying to deal with them in the face of a single barrelled sniper rifle and the whole of America watching.I give the movie 7.5 out of 10, which let's face it is pretty good for a 'Hollywood' movie nowadays.Recommendation: Go watch it, you won't be disappointed.",Phone Booth
273,stimpil,Behold the unbelievable acting prowess of Katie Holmes!!!,8,13 September 2005,"The release of Phone Booth was delayed by Fox until April 4, due to the DC sniper attacks, because evidently everyone in the country forgets about such incidents after 6 months. But boy, had they released it within 5 months, I'm sure people would have been fuming. Phone Booth tells the story of Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) being pinned down in a phone booth by a sniper because he's a sleaze. Despite his marriage to Kelly (Radha Mitchell), he's been trying to get in the pants of Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes) pretty hard, but she's not interested because she's a prude. When he is blamed for killing a pimp, Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) and a bunch of police show up because Colin Farrell is obviously a pretty dangerous super-villain; they must have seen Daredevil. Katie Holmes once again gives a stunning performance. How any actress can pull off so much with a repertoire of three different facial expressions is amazing. Here's a little sample of her academy award potential: Stu calls Katie: crooked smile. Stu says something nice: bigger crooked smile. Stu is about to be shot by a sniper: distraught look (known to the laymen as 'just standing there').Joel Schumacher directs, the man who takes credit for cinematic feats like putting the nipples on Batman's batsuit, and film atrocities like Bad Company. Even though he pulls off Phone Booth rather well, Schumacher is kind of hit (Falling Down) or miss (most of the rest of his films). At least he never fled the country to avoid rape charges... Despite a limited set and cast, the movie is pretty good, and hey, if you don't like it, it's only 80 minutes long, so go get a pretzel or some popcorn.",Phone Booth

The only thing I felt bad was the use of flashy editing.The writing was terrific.  Both major and minor actors performed incredibly well.If you can look past the short flaws, which do happen often in this, you'll see the story and acting are great, and will hopefully give you something to talk about a few hours after watching it.",Phone Booth
275,adam_evans14,Top film,9,1 February 2009,"I don't know whether its just me or are the films in which situations are presented from the beginning of the films to the end spark more interest. Speed, Saw, and Phone Booth all present situations where you cant help but become intrigued to how it'll pan out or be solved.Phone Booth as you may have guessed is set within a phone booth. Coline Farrel enters the booth a cocky,confident man, and leaves it with a very different attitude. So how can a film which is primarly set in a phone booth keep you hooked for 80 minutes. Well early in the film a man is shot, in public and witnesses and evidence suggest its farrel thats the culprit. Farrel cant do anything about it, because he'l be shot by a sniper viewing the booth if he hangs up or leaves. So now you've got the police on hand as a second outfit and another dilemma for farrel to face. They are trying to bring him out of the booth, but if he does come out hes to be shot. You can see how the writers expanded a simple situation ad blown it waaaay out of proportion. Its great. The films offers sharp dialogue and fine acting (only from farrel, but hes all that matters really). Farrel displays all emotions humanly possible throughout the film. Mostly fear. By Hollywood standards this film is relatively short running time, but this works for it, as perhaps 2hours would have been to long to keep the dialogue from becoming tedious. To some up, this is a top film. Watch it. It wont take long.",Phone Booth

While simply through its setting and plot it will never be able to reach the heights of a massive blockbuster, for what it is and its budget it is the greatest achievement filmwise i have seen in a very long time. The storyline is well worked out and builds to a nice climax, and without realising it you will be tense and on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. Twists and sudden turns in the movie make it unpredictable and hence keep the interest levels high.

This review contains many spoilers, but to spare those of you from losing 80 minutes of your life, I will share as follows: When the sniper  shared that he had wired his phone call so that it couldn't be traced and he's bugged the booth, why didn't the plot follow up on that?  The sniper appeared to know a lot about electronics.   What was the deal with that?  The plot explained nothing. The pizza delivery guy's throat was not slashed as the police were heading to the sniper so it should be apparent that he'd been murdered before the hostage taking had started.  (Kiefer Sutherland's character's attention was uninterrupted during the standoff).  It would be obvious that the pizza delivery guy didn't slash his own throat by the angle  of the  blade.  These two observations can't be overlooked during a time when people are conscious of `CSI"", which is topping the tv ratings. Who was this sniper?  Why was he taking this guy hostage? The plot did not evolve to reveal any information about him.  He explained that he'd been watching Collin Farrell, but why did he choose him?  A legitimate reason was shared only to be trashed within minutes of the captivity.  I'm refering, of course, to him being an out of work actor, which he claimed in the initial minutes. It seems that Joel Schumacher, who honored us with `Batman Forever' and Batman and Robin,'  wanted to try and experiment.  He wanted to make a film in ten days -- forget the gaping plot holes.  The plot of this film seemed to be, let's taunt and torture someone for an hour and that will be entertaining.  There wasn't even a decent resolution at the conclusion of this piece of crap.  The sniper walks away, only to say he'll be watching to be sure Farrell stays honest -- WHY?",Phone Booth
284,acinemafan,An awful Film,1,13 July 2003,"Warning:  The following contains spoilers:  Skip this movie if you haven't seen it already. Why didn't the plot follow up on the sniper's ability to prevent the phone call from being tapped?  Was he an electronics expert -- should that have tied into why he was angry with Stu?  Who was this sniper, anyways?  Are we supposed to accept that flimsy vigilante reasoning for why he chose Stu?  Shouldn't it be obvious to us that the pizza delivery guy had been murdered before the standoff began (the sniper had no conversation with anyone other than Stu during that hour). The script went nowhere with no development of who this sniper was even though he was the antagonist in the film.  Worst of all, that was the most dissatisfying ending I have ever seen.   Talk about anti-climatic.  It seems Larry Cohen and Joel Schumacher just wanted to torture audiences for an hour and twenty minutes.",Phone Booth
285,sthapns247,Different...,7,22 July 2003,"I really have never seen a movie like this before.  Technically it should be boring because it all takes place in one area, but it isn't boring.  In fact, it is one hell of a suspenseful movie.  The beginning is kind of cheesy, but it sets up a story that most of us already know anyway.  This guy named Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) has to get to this phone booth in New York City.  Well, he gets to that phone booth about 10 minutes into the movie and leaves that phone booth once after he is in it and that's like 7 minutes before the movie ends.Between those times so much happens, yet so little changes.  This is probably one of the best psychological thrillers I've seen since John Carpenter's ""The Thing.""  You really fell like you are the one in the phone booth, but not like your life is threatened, but for some other reason that just makes your heart race.They managed to put Colin in the booth for and hour and a half and still found things for him to do.  To tell you the truth he could have been in there longer if they wanted to make that happen.  While the twists are kind of predictable, they make what could have been a ""Everyone lives happily ever after..."" ending into something more.  I think the movie would have been a lot better, suspense wise, if they didn't give Kiefer Sutherland a box cover credit.  Other wise,",Phone Booth
286,soymaid327,Wow,10,15 August 2004,"I first saw a preview for this movie on TV. My sister, in the room at the time, said the plot looked ridiculous. I thought of the hero-villain interaction in Speed that, in my opinion, really made that movie great, and wondered.Both of us found what we were expecting.My sister saw a segment of it and disliked it -- she didn't like watching something like that happen to a person, she said; and of course, she still thought the plot was ridiculous. I watched the whole thing. Many times. In fact, I taped it (an honor rarely accorded). I got exactly what I was hoping for.Farrell's acting in this was exceptionally good. He has a way of presenting a reaction so authentic that it is startling to watch. ****SPOILERS An example of this is when he first sees the gun near the light in the booth, he has this moment of surreal terror that was so effective, it gave me and my brother chills. And the way in his climactic scene he goes for broke, and you can hear the pain when his voice cracks and he tries not to start sobbing. Also, when he reaches for the gun the first time, he has an expression of please-don't-let-what-I-think-is-gonna-happen-happen that increases the audience' sympathy almost suddenly. END SPOILERS**** Sutherland's performance reminded me of Anthony Hopkins' in Silence of the Lambs... smooth, and evil. Even Whitaker gives us a realistic police chief, even with those irrelevant, unnecessary and really quite irritating lines about his marital difficulties.But what a film that takes place entirely in a phone booth boils down to is dialogue. This was a good script -- as I mentioned before, the most interesting part of any action movie is the hero/ villain interaction (tragic, considering that most movies now are reduced to horrible pre-fight cliches). This movie took on not only themes of morality and sin, but also had an interesting subtext with isolation in such a connected/ wired society. of course, I pondered the ""issues"" on my third and fourth viewing -- the first and second were all about the conversation itself, not the meaning. the first time there's suspense, but even after that there is the joy of Sutherland's lines, the way the Caller toys with Stu... there is a streak of wicked humor, and Stu's clever (increasingly desperate) attempts to worm his way out. ""I know just the spin to put on this!"" he says of publicity he has frantically offered his captor; the Caller replies drily ""How your terror inspires your creativity?""9/10, demerits for the sub-plot involving Ramey and the extraneous attempt at irony with a negotiator with a grating personality.",Phone Booth

Main character is a sleazy, unfaithful guy who out of nowhere is held hostage by a sniper for no reason other than to seemingly have him repent for all his wrong doings.

291,Dax-8,Surprisingly enjoyable..,8,1 November 2004,"Prior to seeing this film, I had no less than 3 separate people tell me that it was "" stupid"" "" boring"" and a ""waste of time"". When you hear that, you just have to make your own opinion. I sat and watched ""Phone Booth"" with a mild sense of sceptism, and came away at the end of it, thoroughly impressed with Colin Farrell's acting ability. Sure, the plot was a little flimsy, but it zoomed along quite nicely with a little twist at the end. Forest Whitaker again a nicely understated performance, and a few characters like the pimp and negotiator to mix it up a little. I know I will my friends will look at me in disbelief when I tell them that I thought the movie was ""good"", but hey, diversity of taste is what makes the world go round.",Phone Booth
292,Ackbar-2,"Excellent, short suspense",9,14 September 2003,"A surprisingly good movie, and also unpredictable. I spent almost all the movie time gripped to the chair. The movie is a big dialogue between a common guy with a sin, being it falsity and artificiality, and a bullying psycho with a sniper rifle pointing at the former, kind of blackmailing the former. The whole movie is shot at a single New York street, which makes me think this script could even be a theater play. Also, this movie is an excellent sample of a lost art these days: a less than 1:30 hour movie, worth every minute, in a time in which all directors make the corniest movies stretch up to 3 hours. Joel Schumacher is definitely still one of my favorite directors.",Phone Booth

Everyone seems to believe that Colin Farrell is the next huge thing in movies well he disappointed me in this for sure, I reckon Kiefer Sutherland and Forest Whitaker were loads better.In the end it had some good parts but it did drag and the weak finish really didn't help me give it a higher score, wish I could have a voice like Kiefer though.",Phone Booth

I kept my mind open until the end..well, until the confession scene which has to be the most painful scene I have ever seen in a movie. It is a waste of time.

296,bldsimple2,"Fast, Cheap, and Totally In Control.",10,5 April 2003,"Because ""Phone Booth"" is a super-fast piece of cinema, I'll make this is as brief as possible.  Joel Schumacher finally reminds us of what made him such a successful filmmaker in the late 80s/early 90s.  His claustrophobic camerawork never allows us to stray out of the confines of this one section of New York, even the surrounding buildings mirror the confines of titular booth that Colin Farrel finds himself trapped inside.And let's give a big hand to Farrel, who after some showy roles in ""Daredevil"", ""The Recruit"" , and ""Minority Report"" gets to pull off what is almost a one-man performance as the con man who gets his just desserts.If I had any complaints, they would be these: 1.) Farrel's accent does waver a bit.  For those who don't know, his natural voice is thick Irish.2.) Katie Holmes was horribly miscast.  Sure, she's pretty but she has less to do in the film than does Radha Mitchell who plays Farrel's wife.  In fact Holmes literally disappears from the action at some point...as if she was never important to begin with.3.) Forrest Whitaker's character brought with him one of two things: either too much unnecessary backstory that was never fully examined, or not enough necessary backstory to fully explain where he's coming from.Phone Booth clocks in at less than an hour and a half so don't get too comfortable.  The events play out in real time which is ironic since ""24"" star (and long-time Schumacher cohort) Keifer Sutherland gets the unshowy part of the voice on the other end of the phone.  we do get a look at him near the end, but his screen time is sadly limited.",Phone Booth
297,TheGreenSaga,Delivers much more than expected,10,17 April 2003,"Why did I give this movie a ten star rating?  It's not Rear Window, and it's not this year's Memento either.  So why?  Well, to be honest with you, I couldn't find anything in the movie that I didn't like.  I expected to see a movie about a guy in a phone booth who is told by a caller that he can't leave or he'll be shot.  It must mean that I consider these types of premises good, or I would not have spent $8.00 on a ticket and $3.00 on Raisinettes.  When I left the theatre, I was completely amazed.
The movie never lets you down, not even for a second.  The movie can be qualified as an action movie even though there's really not that much action.  Instead, the director chose to use the ""24"" style edit.  This means that instead of breaking the movie down in post-prod scene by scene, the director and the editor chose to show all things that happen simultaneously together at the same time.  The result is a ""real time"" movie, where we never leave the phone booth.  Everything else comes up in side boxes as it happens.  Brilliant!At first I thought this wouldn't work, but as the movie progressed I realized it was necessary.  There is a scene where there is nothing happening but pure gooey emotion.  The director realized that this was one of the most vital parts to the script, but it seemed out of place given the pace of the film.  Things were done so when this firstly-conceived emotional scene takes place, you're still biting your nails and on the edge of your seat.  At the end of the movie I was actually disappointed.  I wanted to go back in the phone booth.  I didn't want it to end.All in all, I was very shocked with the newest from Hollywood's ""let's make an independent film which can't be called independent because it was made in Hollywood"" genre.",Phone Booth

I think this is due to some overacting or unrealistic action on the sniper's part.For the most part, though, this is a very tense and moving film. I highly recommend it.",Phone Booth

301,Juansmith,Slick direction and great performances,8,6 April 2003,"(minor spoilers within) The screen debut of this relatively simple concept, delayed first by a lack of notoriety on the part of its main stars, and again by the Beltway sniper shootings, probably will leave a lot of 2nd year film students wondering ""Why didn't I come up with something like this?""While the film derives the main idea of its plot from the 1996 indie film ""End of the Line"", Schumacher's direction (reminiscent of TV's '24', with real-time, split-screen shots, as well as numerous looks through the sniper's point of view, complete with crosshairs) gives a very entertaining cinematographical look to what is, with virtually no exception, a single-scene piece.Farrell delivers the latest of a long line of excellent performances (along with the latest of his seemingly endless bag of accents). His performance only wavers once or twice, particularly late in the movie during a rather emotionally overdone monologue scene.Sutherland's voiced character ends up as something of a vigilante, although his motives aren't made wholly clear as we're made to believe that he was almost justified in his actions. While this unresolved and inadequately explored ""morality play"" aspect of the film is what may prevent it from becoming a true classic, the film was still quite well done as a thrilling piece.8 out of 10",Phone Booth

This movie, despite it's lack of pure action, makes up in some truly heart-pounding situations always hinging on life and death. It's frightening in that the sniper locked himself away from being traced by cops and can see Stu's (Farrel) every move within the booth. The story become fast-paced and will grab your attention and won't let go until the end. It's funny that until the very end you only hear the sniper's voice, but when Stu is waiting in an ambulance Sutherland walks up and talks to him. Then the last scene is Sutherland walking down the street with a large case. As he passes the phone booth he give it a glance.

305,natport19,a sure-shot enjoyable theatrical experience...,9,6 April 2003,"The documentary Lost in La Mancha focuses on ex-Python Terry Gilliam's vision of transferring the classic story of Don Quixote to the screen. Directing the movie in his head for the past ten years, Gilliam thought the production would turn out to be `terrible and beautiful.'  He was right (with the former at least).  The film shows the inevitable decline of the project during its pre-production and early production stages.  Phone Booth suffered from another case of misfortune.  Director Joel Schumacher managed to shoot the film in only ten days on one set, but, with all of the consistent troubles in America, it seemed highly illogical to award it a release date amidst the current terrorism, war, and other acts of violence.April 4, years after the film's completion, this remarkable picture finally received its release.  And even now is not the best time to release the film, but, nonetheless, it clinched Colin Farrell's third consecutive movie opening in the number one spot this year-and it is only early April.  For over an hour of Phone Booth, Farrell's character is pleading with the voice on the other end of the telephone to spare his life.  Dead on with its use of suspense, intensity, and morality, Phone Booth is the continuation of a human spirited thriller to the likes of last year's Changing Lanes and Panic Room.At well under ninety minutes, the film manages to be short, gripping, and entirely complete.  Unlike The Life of David Gale or Basic, Phone Booth does not try to trick the audience.  It offers a highly frightening situation, tremendous acting, and an amazing screenplay with an appropriate ending. From fans of Rear Window to Speed, Phone Booth is quite possibly the most sure-shot enjoyable theatrical experience of the year.

311,paulbrec,A great story based on a simple concept.,9,10 April 2003,"I have always enjoyed Joel Schumacher's work. The same goes for this great piece of work. I was amazed at how well one could build a whole story around a man in a phone booth. Points in the film had interesting presentations. Such as, displaying four different scenes at the same time. Plus, the sniper's voice is non-directional, as opposed to just a voice on the telephone. The only drawback with this film, is the rather slow beginning, but once the lead character steps into that phone booth, that's it. This is an excellent film with a great story, and excellent acting.",Phone Booth
312,kevinmanf,"An entertaining roller coaster ride loaded with morals, some plausible others far fetched.",7,5 March 2006,"Joel Schumacher's The Phone Booth is an entertaining roller coaster ride, a fast paced thriller loaded with morals, some plausible others far fetched.Collin Farell as Stu Shephard is the main character in a film that is practically set on one scenario: a phone booth, the last one in Manhattan. In the world of public relationships, business, change of credit cards, you name it, a man like Shephard is the king. He represents the inter-medium between half truths and public lies. He is a man without compassion, able to not pay his colleagues, lie at any price and sell his soul to the devil of public relationships. He is the perfect guy to threaten for truth He removes his marriage ring for a couple of minutes very mid day from the same booth to talk to his young (Katie Holmes) woman who is aspiring to be an actress, giving her false hopes about becoming a star. But someone seems to be aware of Shephard's ways. This guy is cold minded, capable of putting into great difficulties a man with a growing feeling of guilt, a fact perhaps overly underlined by Larry Cohen's screenplay. The phone booth of New York rings. Somebody must pick up the phone and Shephard is to close to ignore it. The guy behind the phone is the sniper, and he wants Shephard to confess his sins or get shot.The plot almost belongs to a short feature film but Schumacher does a great job of conserving the only scenario (with the exception of some scenes where we see the police) without ever being dull. This is partly due to the great verbal exchange between the victim and the sniper. The sniper's voice suggests a strong presence, a sadistic but mesmerizing tone. ""Do you see the tourists with their video cameras, hoping the cops will shoot so that they sell the tape?"", he says in one of the film's best moments. Collin Farell offers enough fast talk, gestures of fear and regret to bring his character to life, which is all the more compelling considering he is basically talking to a mouthpiece for the most part. The ever tightening camera work does a great job of increasingly adding to the tension.With this film, I can see what Schumacher was trying to do: to criticise without pity a society filled with adultery, racism and hypocrites (everything Shephard represents) who do not see that they are the deciders of their own destinies. The film's weakest point is the sniper's motive which is closer to morality than the ethic of behaviour which united with some fancy words, reduces some of the film to some very basic moral objectives that even a five year old could understand. But as a whole, this is a film worth watching just to have a good time.",Phone Booth

Colin Farrell is spectacular as a sleazy New York publicist named Stu who is trapped inside a phone booth on the phone with an anonymous sniper who says he'll shoot Stu unless he follows his demands. The timing in this movie was really brilliant- the whole thing with the strippers and the poor cop (Forest Whitaker) who tries to negotiate with Stu to find out what is really happening is very interesting and clever. Colin Farrell proves that he is a true star, he is really quite amazing and shows a great range of emotions, going from sly and cocky to his raw, heartwrenching ""breakdown"" at the end. I think his ""breakdown"" scene is incredibly powerful. If he doesn't get nominated for an award it would be a shame. Also, Kiefer Sutherland does a great voiceover as the creepy sniper.

The plot is simple, which isn't necessary bad, but in this movie it is. At first I thought it'd be interesting to know how everything gets resolved, but I soon realized it wasn't really interesting - it was so unreal! The actors (well, mainly just one actor) didn't strike me either. But the ending is clearly the worst part: the bad guy gets to escape from a highly-controlled-by-the-police hotel and he visits the 'hero' and talks to him and nobody notices it, and finally the bad guy escapes! As you can see the end is absolutely stupid, but I can't say I did really expect something better since the full movie was awful and boring.

318,fugacity2000,Fantastic movie! (SPOILERS),10,19 July 2003,"""Phone Booth"" is finally a psychological thriller that gets it right, something not seen out of Hollywwod in a long time.  I was completely engrossed in this movie from the opening sequences onward. I could not turn away even for a second, and that is saying something about the story and the performances, which are stellar.  Colin Farrell is great as the phony publicist who is confrtonted in the booth by the sins he's made in his life.  Kiefer Sutherland, despite being on screen for only a minute or two near the end, is absolutely wonderful as the psychotic voice on the phone, toying with Stu; kind of like a prosecutor from hell, outlining the wrongs that Stu has done and threatening retribution.Some might say the end is a cheat, but I think not.  I have issues with people who seem to think that every movie has to be a downer, that major characters have to die, in short, everything has to be a tragedy to be good. Not so.  I thought this ending was good, and I liked the way that Forrest Whitaker's character was able to sense something strange going on and not just assume Stu was an insane jerk.This is a movie woth watching, multiple times.

320,jigshaun,"Taught, Original, Daring, very entertaining",10,20 September 2002,"I saw the premiere of ""Phone Booth"" at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival, and I LOVED IT!  It's unusual for a feature like this to even show at the TIFF, which should say something about it.  I know it sounds like a hard sell.  The whole thing takes place outside a phone booth in Manhattan, and it was shot in 10 days for less than 2 million dollars.  But this movie is electric.  It BLEW ME AWAY!  Stuart `Stu' Shepard (Colin Farrell), a sleazy publicist, uses this phone booth to call his girlfriend, because his wife checks his cell phone bills.  The phone rings, and when he picks it up, all hell breaks loose.  The voice on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland is just terrifying) warns him that if he leaves the booth he will be killed.  At first Stu doesn't believe him, but we find out pretty quick that his life is in real danger, and the stranger on the other end of the line knows EVERYTHING about Stu and his life.  Then the police show up, (Forest Whitaker is wonderful as always as the cop in charge) and order Stu out of the booth.  I spent the next hour on the edge of my seat.  I don't want to give anything more away, but it is one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in a very long time!  You should go see this movie!  I don't think it's going to get a very big release, even though it's directed by Joel Schumacher (St. Elmo's Fire, Flatliners, Batman and Robin, 8mm, Tigerland).  Schumacher was at the screening, and he talked about how a number of different actors (including  Mel Gibson) and directors had been attached to the script, and it had taken years to get it to the screen.  He was able to do it with Colin Farrell after 20th Century Fox exec's saw him in `Tigerland' and decided to take a chance.  But he's still not considered a `big' star.  And Kiefer only came to the project at the end (though Schumacher said he was the only guy for the role, and I agree), and you don't see him much.  So the movie may not get much of a push when it comes out.  Don't let that dissuade you.  If you like a good ride, you should go see this movie.",Phone Booth
321,tarryrob,An innovative suspenseful thriller!,8,6 November 2003,"Schumacher's latest outing PHONE BOOTH takes a familiar formula and applies some clever new spins.  We begin with a stereotypical `Scream' like psycho killer (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) who loves to taunt and terrorize his victims via the telephone.  However, Schumacher deviates from the standard psycho killer fare in intriguing ways. Firstly, our primary victim is male (Colin Farrell) not female. Rather than being trapped helpless and home alone, the victim is duped into answering a phone call in a busy New York City telephone booth.  The killer then threatens to open fire with a high power rife unless Farrell (playing a New York City publicist) stays on the line and does everything he's told.  Schumacher takes pains at the beginning of the film to paint Farrell's character as a lying, manipulative self-centered lowlife.  Again, the director breaks with the stereotypical formula in which the killer's victims are innocents who draw the audiences' sympathy, by painting Farrell as a worm, Schumacher cleverly inverts the formula so that the audience actually enjoys watching the victim squirm.   The killer tells Farrell he has set other victims up in the same manner and has killed before.  To prove to Farrell he means business, he kills a bystander.  This acts as a reality check both for Farrell and the audience  it's one thing to see a low life being made to squirm but quite another for the sniper to open fire on a crowded New York Street. The audience now expects Schumacher to start running up the body count.  But the director again dashes audience expectation and turns the film primarily into a psychological thriller rather than the action suspense or slasher fare we've been led to expect. The camera and action focus almost exclusively on the phone booth (reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE) and the publicist's agony and humiliation as the killer forces him to stay in the booth, now surrounded by police, and carry out his twisted wishes upon threat of death. Unaware of the sniper's presence, the police think the publicist has the killed the bystander.  Farrel's character must continue playing the killer's deadly game in hopes he can somehow tip the police before either they, or the killer, end his life.  Schumacher caps the film with a nice (though not totally unpredictable) twist ending.  An innovative suspenseful outing!  I gave it an 8 out 10!TarryRobWpg, MB Canada",Phone Booth
322,suntorytime10,"Don't touch that dial...no, don't.....NOOOOOO!!",8,27 February 2003,"Stu Shepard (Farrell) thinks he has it all: great job as publicist to the stars, a beautiful wife (Radha Mitchell) , lively lifestyle and fancy accessories. Until one fateful day with a seven foot giant. That of course, is a local phone booth. Stu uses this same phone booth in the heart of NY to call his mistress (Katie Holmes)so that his wife cannot trace the calls to her on his mobile. On a seemingly normal day, Stu heads for the booth and calls her. As he puts down the receiver and leaves the booth, the phone begins to ring. And, as human as Stu is, and as the film astutely points out, that any ringing phone will be at some point be answered. Stu answers the phone, only to be greeted by the voice of a man who is aiming a sniper rifle directly at him. This begins the longest morning in Stu's life, having to bow to the callers every demand in order to keep his, and others lives intact. Before he knows it, Stu is entangled with the caller in a game of bluffs, deceit, betrayal and the fight for survival, with nail-biting results. The film, directed by the overly criticised Joel Schumacher, is a superbly crafted, original and tense tail of peoples obsession not just with phones, but with fame and taking things for granted. With the films original and high-tech plot, Schumacher superbly collaborates close-ups, point-of-view shots and fast-moving pace to fantastic effect, and his use of the now infamous split-screen format used so effectively in ""24"" is also a standout joy. But this type of standout film requires a standout cast to support it, and although I have my reservations about Colin Farrell, here he proves his ""Next Big Thing"" status fantastically with a superb performance, which is not only charismatic and captivating, but is also poignant and powerful. Mitchell, Holmes and Forest Whitaker also add there own terrific, powerful performances, Whitaker in particular again proves his worth with a tremendous turn as the mixed-up cop trying to help and ultimately save Stu. But the film belongs to the invisible man, and that man is Jack Bauer himself, Kiefer Sutherland. His menacing, malevolent and all together nasty performance as the caller is truly outstanding, only heightened by the fact that we never see him, relying on a malicious, ill-natured tone of voice, which doesn't disappoint, being both terrifying and vicious. (Don't worry, this won't influence the producer of ""24"" into turning Jack Bauer to the dark side! At least I hope not!) Aside from the ""24"" fanatical quibbles, the film really is a treat from beginning to end, and although it does take itself slightly too seriously at times and at times seems a little far-fetched, these are only minor shortcomings. All in all, it is still a stunning film, superbly crafted, brilliantly scripted film with some super performances from the ensemble cast, ""Phone Booth"" well worth 81 minutes of anyone's time. Fantastic. ****",Phone Booth
323,shadownlite,Pass On This One,1,12 July 2003,"""Phone Booth"" was not worth the rental fee. I was hoping to like this film due to the good reviews that friends had given it and the presence of Colin Farrell, whom I like as an actor. I was very disappointed.I was confused by the beginning because it was all Colin Farrell talking on a cell phone about deals with magazines. It was not fast paced and very slow. It also looked like it had been filmed on poor quality film. I got used to the look but, cringed as the story just went nowhere.It was 81 minutes of Colin Farrell in a phone booth...and even he cannot make that interesting. I found myself fighting the urge to get up and walk away to do something else. It was a movie that made me want to walk away and not bother with the rest of the story.I never felt the sense of unease or suspense in his character's situation since only one person was killed with the sniper gun. Really, it took away from the urgency of the phone call and Farrell not hanging up to not have more danger. Yes, the sniper killed someone and caused Farrell some pain by shooting his earlobe...but I never worried about the situation or got caught up in it.It was also very ""anti-climax"", or as my brother told me, ""The ending is a cop out"". It just ends...nothing is really resolved except that Farrell is gotten out of the situation and then threatened by caller for the future. It left me thinking, ""That's it????"". I was so disgusted that I turned the movie back into the video store so I wouldn't forget about it and have to pay overdue charges on such a terrible movie. I say pass on this one, save your money, and rent something else. I have to give it a 1/10.",Phone Booth
324,tkchess,This isn't an original movie...,5,14 May 2005,"If the Wesley Snipes movie with the same premesis didn't do it for you, this one will. Something about this type of story makes you want to scream, since (WARNING: SPOILER) the bad guy doesn't get his due. You REALLY want to see the bad guy (Keifer Sutherland) get his due after this crazy stunt this guy pulls. If a guy wants to cheat on his wife, let him...hehe. Let the woman find out herself and cause some trouble!!! If you want to see a movie where a bad guy you really learn to hate (in the movie of course...heh) gets his due go see Stalag 17 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046359/)...great movie from 1952...one of my favorites.But yeah, the Wesley Snipes movie called Liberty Stands Still was the first to do the ""guy-makes-person-his-pawn-with-a-sniper-rifle"" theme. Sure, they were both in 2002, but the Wesley Snipes movie was first.Both movies are exactly the same. Some person has some kind of ""issue"" that this crazy guy with a sniper wishes to make this person admit to on TV and such. And while holding this person in the sniper's scope, the person is unable to do anything that would attract the attention of anyone, namely the law enforcement. And of course in the process there are innocent bystanders who are killed, as they interfere with the person talking to the sniper.The nice thing about these kinds of movies is that its all shot in one place and the number of actors/actresses are minimal. So there is little chance that viewers will get lost in the movie...and its not that hard to jump into the movie half-way through. And, if you have to take a bathroom break while you are watching there is really no need to hit the pause button...hehe.I'm not a big fan of these movies where someone is playing a game with some other person...well then again, the movie The Game with Michael Douglas was a game, but the idea of pulling a game of life that was so serious yet fake made the movie fun and interesting. But these movies, I just don't like the fact that (WARNING: SPOILER) the bad guy doesn't get his due. At least in The Game, they make it seem like the bad guy gets his due when Michael Douglas starts to realize its just a game and he decides to do something about it...There is no replay value with Phone Booth or Liberty Stands Still.

326,Misanthropic_Disease,"Empty, anemic and unmemorable : Small in every way",4,22 April 2006,"I must admit that I'm impressed to see how high rated this movie is so far, as I sure do not share that opinion. And guys, please, how amateur can you be! Stop rating everything 10 stars, PLEASE, use that opportunity to make a mature, precise and well analyzed rating, alright? It gets annoying for those who take the time to think... Well, anyway... A few days after seeing this film, I heard a colleague almost yelling to everyone how GOOD, how breathtaking and loaded of suspense this movie was, he was almost sweating, just talking about it... pathetic. Well, I remained silent; thinking to myself how fool this guy was anyway.No, really, although I'm glad to see an American movie breaking the usual linear scenario recipe, and being confident enough to keep it that short, in the end; it still left me somehow in a state of confused emptiness. I mean, OK, I'm alright with short movies, I'm okay with sad endings, or whatever most people dislike to see in a regular rental. So the problem isn't there, I guess the lenght has more to do with the inner limits of the ""Phone Boot""'s concept, as a longer production would quickly turn in circle.Problem's neither about actors, which most are established talents delivering convenient performances. In fact, the hiccup isn't about what the movie got right or wrong, it's not about what it does, but more about what it does not. It doesn't innovate in any artistic way, nor in any psychological way. The way the subject is shown doesn't match the way it intended, pretended or wanted to be. This story sure was better on paper than on screen, no doubt about it. The strenghts aren't shinning enough, all of this 'cause of the boring and standard technical execution. Oh, yeah, and it's in New-York, wow... almost impressive, but especially original, really... Oh, and main characters HAD to be well known actors, yeah, sure... it wouldn't have been attractive enough for the middle American customer, of course, of course... A lot of these kind of stupid details would have made a much better piece of work. Some scenario bits should have been changed, like seeing the ""mysterious"" sniper guy, at the end, wasn't necessary, it was even cliché (and everyone knew it was Kiefer Sutherland from the first time you hear him anyway). And the ending could hardly be worst and more uninspired. The spectator needs to leave, at the end, with something still working his mind. Otherwise, you get the ""emptiness syndrome"", and ""Phone Boot"" is the best example of its kind.The unusual scenario stepping is a slippy way, and it hurts. Focusing on a single element like this ""selfmade -playing god- justice"" doesn't leave enough meat around the bone, and quickly blow itself. The rest of the movie will or will not succeed, depending of your naivety and impressionability. It personally didn't bring me on the edge of my seat at all, it just seemed cheesy and repetitive to me, and maybe 1h20 was short, but it still felt like a waste of time, as it left me deceived, unsatisfied and, EMPTY.",Phone Booth
327,lafilmgroup,better line coaches necessary (spoilers inside!),7,17 September 2003,"I must say that I did like the movie, well made, there was quite some suspense even  though it was obvious in a lot of ways what was going to happen (the pizza guy, the  wife, the good cop). Colin Farells acting was quite superb and really believable. So was Forest Whitaker  (who's just a great actor!) but Radha Mitchell (the wife),  who coached her? She didn't translate at all! I thought it was a bit short, even though I do agree that it couldn't go on the way it was.. Whatever, still enjoyed it!",Phone Booth
328,LordElfstone,strengths and weaknesses alike ***spoilers***,8,12 May 2003,"I read a lot about the plot holes and I have to admit, there are many of them in such a short movie. I can't believe that one guy with no visible weapon is surrounded by police forces like this. With half a dozen snipers on the roofs, cops with shields and two or three dozen at gunpoint. Yes, that's stupid. Given the obvious evidence of a sniper on the other end of the line, that's even more so.But try to forget about this for a while and you will have fun and you will laugh a lot (I did) cause the psycho shooter played (well, sort of) by Kiefer Sutherland has a load of good lines. He is really funny while commenting the sometimes pathetic attempts of his victim. The dialogue is the main strength of this movie. Those who are complaining about the length should keep in mind that the story is based on a short film. And tell me how to keep tension in a phone booth for any longer than they did?
The outcome is not very intelligent I might say, but it at least works well enough. This is an unusual situation we're facing here. It's not easy to make a good movie in a phone booth with a super-plot hole-proof plot. You can always say that they tried to keep it low budget as possible by filming in and around a single phone booth and in less than two weeks. That's what it is about, yes. I don't mind it. Joel Schumacher delivered a very bad Batman, but you forget about Flatliners, Falling Down and Lost Boys. Those are far from being bad.This movie is a good example of sacrificing a well-rounded plot for the sake of dialogue and to that extent it works perfectly well for me.8/10",Phone Booth

All I have heard about this movie is praise, but I just don't get it.  The only saving grace for this film was colin farrell's acting, which was done well enough to be convincing, but still felt empty.  Though it was nothing next to the hollowness of the chemistry of the characters.  from Stu Shepherd's aide, to his wife, Pam, even the sinister voice, there was nothing.  And to me, this is what brought this film down, I sat through the movie bored, because I couldn't care about any of these characters, and I didn't believe it.  Not to mention the retarded idea of bringing in the police chief's personal problems, boy was that awkward.  and ugly.  Throw in the hasty ending that seems to have no thought behind it and you have yourself 81 minutes of a flick that is worth a watch, but certainly won't be going anywhere, or resurrecting Joel Shumacher's career.",Phone Booth

Should have been nominated for best actor in leading role.  You could feel the drama unfold watching him.Great edge of your seat flick,Phone Booth
331,leroux,The movie stinks...of awesomeness,9,28 August 2003,"Well, I was going into Phone Booth expecting a good movie to kill an hour and a half with. Instead I ended up watching a great movie that seemed alot longer, but in the good sense.I was completely unsure of what was gonna happen, and found myself starting to actually care about the characters which is a pretty rare occurance in today's films.Colin Ferrel gives a great performance in his role, truly showing that he has incredible range. On an unrelated note, I only found out he had an Irish accent about a week ago. He completly captures the character in his deliverly by at least looking like he's trying to not look scared.Kiefer Sutherland's job with his role should be etched in the mind of every voice actor on the planet. I don't think any other actor on the planet could of pulled this off so well.Every other performance in the movie aren't really memorable (with the possible exception of Forest Whitaker) but are solid and keep the quality of the film up.My only real complaint with the movie is the ending. It just took a lot away from Sutherland's character, showing his face took away alot of the mystery surrounding him.Regardless the movie kicks ass, probably the best movie of the year that doesn't completly cater to the Academy. It deserves at least a rental so go do so.",Phone Booth
332,Nearstars,Don't hang up!,9,16 November 2003,"This one was a real hit with me.From the unique and bold idea (events are all depicted in real time, and there is basically only one scene throughout the film), and the excellent performance of Farrell, to the accomplished pace and tension courtesy of the script and Schulmacher's direction, this film scored all around for me.I don't need to say too much about the plot, for fear of spoilers, and the fact that you can read them elsewhere, so I will largely deal with the character interaction.Farrell's character is a master study of both scripting and acting performance. Here we have an obnoxious, deceitful, self-centered, and apparently self-confident publicist introduced to us, and through the film, this character's is broken down morally and emotionally, to reveal a fragile man underneath, and one who appears ultimately repentant for the sins he is being judged upon by ""the voice"" on the other end of the phone. Amazingly, at the end of it all we end up sympathising for this obnoxious yuppy.Sutherland, as ""the voice"" brings a remarkably black humour to the whole proceedings, and achieves his task well of manipulating Farrell's character like a puppet through ""moralist terrorism.""A daring film venture - extremely well executed by all concerned, and highly rewarding to experience.Score: a (rare) 9/10 from me.",Phone Booth

Well, if you think like that, then you missed the entire point of the movie. Phone Booth is an internal conflict between Stu and hsi own sef-image. Stu is both the antagonist and the protagonist. While, the sniper being confounded with the ""bad guy"" is really the catalyst trying to help the main character ""change"".

If we start with the plot, and this isn't a to heavy spoiler. Why doesn't the police just arrest the guy? I mean, yeah they think he has a gun, but they are like a million cops there. Surely they would have arrested him without a problem if they had to. This is actually the only problem to the movie. The acting is good, and the movie is well directed, and has a good morale to it.

But trust when I say that this movie was just great! The film stars Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Katie Holmes, and Radha Mitchell, and is about a man who is held hostage in a phone booth by a sniper. Without spoiling anything, I will say that this is definitely a comeback for Joel Schumacher, after making Batman & Robin. It is a well-directed, well-acted, fast paced, solid flick which I wasn't bored with for a second. I thought that Colin Farrell was great as the lead actor in the movie, and I'm sure that whoever is interested in solid thrillers will most likely like this flick.

Never mind the lingering questions (How DID the sniper get all that information on him? Just by bugging the phone booth?) the film was a great ride. Sutherland, like his father, has such a wonderful and menacing voice andappearance. He was perfect. I didn't know he was in the film and throughout the thing I was wondering where they got the great voice talent... I didn't recognize him.  Colin Farrell did a great job of taking his character from a thoroughly unlikable lout to a truly sympathetic character. I'm still thinking about the use of the last phone booth in a world of cell phone ubiquity as a vehicle to force the confessions of a man who exemplifies the duplicity and mendacity that themodern world takes for granted.",Phone Booth
337,citizengotto,could've been better...,7,4 April 2003,"Spoilers Ahead....
Phone Booth is Colin Farrel's first ""leading man role"" since Tigerland a few years ago. Or I should say, its his first Hollywood Leading Man role, as Tigerland was a small independent movie that didnt get a wide release. For those who know him only as Bullseye, the villian in Daredevil, it should come as a surprise that he's talented enough to carry a movie on his own. And Phone Booth is a movie that quite literally requires just that, as he's on screen for 99% of the runtime, save for a few shots of the scared crowd, Katie Holmes and Forest Whitaker. Its unfortunate, then that his best peformance in years comes in a film bogged down by its director, Joel Schumacher (The Lost Boys, Falling Down and most memorably...for all the wrong reasons...Batman and Robin). Schumachers More-is-More approach to film-making makes what should be a tense, Hitchock-ian thriller into a Bruckheimer knock-off with so many flashy techniques its like watching MTV on 3 different screens. But even Schumacher's style cant totally ruin the movie, it does have a few gripping, ""whats-gonna-happen-next"" moments. However the last fifteen minutes becomes a yuppie-redeeming-himself movie with a message which, while not entirely bad, kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 6/10",Phone Booth

But I want to praise it for what it DOES give.  It gives you a good 1hr 20 mins show that only slows down to let you catch your breath before you're back off to the races again.The film was advertised correctly.  What they hint at in the trailer is what you will see in the film.  Nothing p***es me off more than a movie that promises to be one thing in an ad but in reality turns out to be something different.  This movie held up its end of the bargain.I cannot praise Colin Farrell enough for his performance.  He does a wonderful job.  There is one scene in particular where he absolutely shines and you'll know it when you see it.Keifer Sutherland phoned in this role (ba dum boom ching).  Actually he did do a good job considering he had to sell the audience on his voice acting for them to buy him as a threat.  Good job Keif, glad to see you back in form again (cause as much as I dig it, ""24"" will run out of gas eventually so here's hoping the movies start rockin again for ya)The ending did leave some to be desired.  But when you look at it.. why would this seemingly omnipotent sniper REALLY want to spend so much time and effort on a guy who is as tame as Farrell's character anyway?
Anyway, it was a good film.  Not great, but good.  Kudos also to Schumacher for somewhat redeeming himself here.  This is a good date film and one I'll add to my DVD collection.  I give it an 8/10.",Phone Booth
339,Stryder-56897,"""Come on, Stu! Don't you get the game yet?""",10,22 November 2020,"Phone Booth has always been my favorite film directed by the late Joel Shumacher, I know a lot of people hate him just because he made Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. People say that he's a bad director, I can't agree when he made films like this, The Lost Boys, 8MM, The Client etc.Released back in 2002, Phone Booth follows Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) who's a real jerk who is a publicist who cheated on his wife (Radha Mitchell) with his client (Katie Holmes). Stu usually calls the latter from a phone booth so his wife won't find out. One day while using a booth, Stu get's a call from a mysterious caller (Kiefer Sutherland), who has a sniper planted on Stu from a window. Now there's conflict and stuff happens that I won't spoil.This a great movie and I wish it got more love and recognition. Granted a lot of people like it but I wish it was iconic in most people's eyes. Colin Farrell absolutely nailed this role as this guy who thinks he's on top of the world until this experience, Kiefer Sutherland's performance as the ""Caller"" was absolutely perfect, his voice alone was so creepy and menacing.

341,TheEnigmaticMrKurtz,Amazingly Apt for a Single Concept,10,13 April 2003,"Joel Schumacher's ""Phone Booth"" is clearly his best work short of ""Tigerland"", and one of the few films I've seen in recent memory that actually had any merit as a film. For the director who almost destroyed Batman, he has fully redeemed himself with this virtual masterpiece. Colin Farrell landed one of the most interesting film character roles in a long time with that of Stu Shepherd, an agent with a young wife and a younger mistress. Stu has taken life for granted, and has refused to accept that he is morally corrupt, but is soon shown the error of his ways when he picks up a ringing phone, and the caller on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland, in an excellent role) tells him he will kill him if he hangs up. For approximately 76 minutes afterwards, Schumacher takes us on a real time, gripping journey of the life of a man and a modern morality tale with a strong message, albeit using violence as the guidelight. Colin Farrell plays Stu with a desperation that perfectly captures Stu's fear and anxiety. He makes you care about the character and his fate, a challenge that not many actors can pull off. Forest Whitaker, excellent in ""Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai"", plays Captain Ed Ramey with such sensitivity that you can't help but feel for this poor man, who has lost his marriage and his life with his devotion to his job. *SPOILER* In a scene when the caller forces Stu to ask Captain Ramey if he masturbates at night, the sadness that overcomes Ramey's face speaks volumes more than any line could do. *END OF SPOILERS* Moments of great tension fill this movie, and they immerse the audience. Throughtout the movie, you feel for Stu Shepherd and fear for his life. Schumacher in this film demonstrates why he is considered a directorial talent, The cinematography in the film is also commendable. Tight, claustrophobic camera angles that surround Farrell in the phone booth add to the tension, and make this film one of the greats. Hopefully enough people will agree with me as to vote this film into the Top 250 because unlike other films with similar concepts, ""Phone Booth"" hits a homer out of the park and doesn't break stride while running the bases. 11/10",Phone Booth

I am the first one to lose myself in a movie, let reality leave me and accept plot lines that make no sense or scenes that just would never happen.  In real life this scenerio of Colin in the phone booth would have been over 5 minutes after the NYC cops showed up.  I mean, he is surrounded by cops all within 30 feet of him. His hands are obvioulsy free and not holding a gun.  There are riot police with the steel sheilds - how fast could they just storm the booth and tackle him, even if he did have a gun in his pocket.  That is just one of dozens of examples of this nonsense movie.  That red dot from the lazer on the gun - come on, did you see how ig and bright that was.  It was so fake.  No matter where it shined, nothing got in it's way, it was so badly done.  Then when they realize there is a sniper somewhere, what do they do?  Nothing, they leave all the citizens on the street, all the cops stand around... Come on, they would have cleared the street in a second.  They made some excuse in the movie about why they wouldn't clear the street, but it made no sense. And his dopey wife - 1 second she is in the cop car, then she gets out, then she goes in, then she gets out...  And the Keifer voice over... How come all the other people he spoke to on the phone sounded like they were on the phone (sort of), but Keifer's voices boomed over everything like a god.This movie is beyond words, it was horrible.  Colin was fine, but the plot line sucked.   They must have spent about 2 million total on the dump of a movie and we got suckered into seeing it.

Schumachers depiction of street life is god awful and full of early 2000s stereotypes, and the beginning is a bit long and is pretty clearly stretched out to get the movie over a allotted time, and the ending isn't fantastic.

My only gripe was the sound mix for The Caller's (Sutherland) voice, youll see what I mean once you see it. Aside from that, the movie really shows what kind of film-making can be done with a small budget.Its tight and manages to keep you in the edge of your seat for the duration. I was specially surprised at this, because being a fan of Kiefer Sutherland, I was already well aware of his voice and who he was, which sort of spoils a certain aspect of the film, and the movie was STILL able to maintain my attention and the tension in me, i can only imagine what someone that might not recognize the voice might feel when watching it!

350,harpoonz37,"Not as good as they say, or as bad as it could have been.",7,26 April 2003,"From some of the first comments that were written here that I read on opening day, I thought this would be a masterful piece of cinematography in an unusual setting.**** SPOILERS ****Sadly, there were several things that were not exactly as advertised.  The main character (Colin Farrell) is not evil.  He's a sleazeball, sure, but no more than any other fast-talking salesman.  By the end of the movie, he's been 'reduced' to that of a typical movie hero.The protagonist is, however, much more evil than first shown.  Of course, he's also superhuman (the angle of the laser shots that he takes varies throughout the show, meaning he is moving all over the scene, and he makes shots that are solely the realm of movie-land.  Shooting out the Stu's ear? Umm...right.) Again, the angles shown in this movie are beyond belief. Even disregarding all other factors, how do you target (supposedly from the upper floors of an apartment building) the west ear of someone from the east side? Answer?  Its not possible.BUT, technicalities aside, this was an enjoyable movie.  The characters are good, and the plot line is neither too slow, or too quick.  Kiefer's voice was perfect for the slot that he is in.Overall, 7/10.",Phone Booth
351,lschow310,a taut thriller but also thought-provoking,9,16 June 2003,"I first saw this movie back in April, and it really drew my attention.I found the movie to be a taut thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.I didn't like Stu Shepard that much at the beginning, but after he entered the phone booth, I was hooked.The movie also gave me a lot to think about in regards to forced confession, repentance, unconditional love (from Kelly), and sacrifice.SPOILERS  BELOW:  Kiefer Sutherland's appearance at the end scared me.  Just when I thought that everything was okay now.  :-)The only thing I didn't like were the prostitutes.  I found the scene with the prostitutes and later with Leo to be annoying.I was also a bit disappointed that this movie wasn't just about anyone answering a public payphone and therefore being trapped into being a hostage.  Instead, Stu was targeted because he wasn't exactly a nice guy.Other than that, I really liked this movie because of its entertainment value and because it really got me to think.",Phone Booth
352,displacedbeatnik,"The Best Reason Not To Pick Up A Phone Since ""Scream""",9,9 September 2003,"Any movie that combines the plots of two of the greatest films ever, ""Rear Window"" and ""Taxi Driver"" can not fail to be a great film itself.This is a bold contention to be sure, but one I'm willing to make for this film.  If Alfred Hitchcock were still alive today, this is the kind of film he would be making.  Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece of suspense (in my opinion) was ""Rear Window.""  The reason for this particular Hitchcock film's greatness was that the entire movie took place within the confines of one inquisitive newspaper photographer's apartment.  Yet in this limited setting, Hitchcock managed to build suspense in ways that some of his other movies could not.  The only shortcoming of ""Rear Window"" film (and it was a minor flaw) was that this voyeur's life was only in real danger for about five minutes and that it was his snooping that got him into the mess.Perhaps it's because the villain ""Rear Window"" was not someone with a mission, merely someone who wanted his wife gone and then to hightail it out of town that this danger element never showed its face as much as it could.""Phone Booth"" is not constrained by this villainous motivation.  Keifer Sutherland (although only seen at the end) plays a man with a Travis Bickle (from ""Taxi Driver"") complex in more modern times.  He wants a rain to come down and was the scum away and he wants to be the one seeding the clouds. His victim on the day of the movie, shot in real-time (although there are others in the past) is an up-and-coming publicist played by Colin Farrell (whose character, Stu Shepard may not have an honest bone in his body).
Match these two characters up for a fast paced 80 minutes and you have a heart pounding drama all in the confines of less than a city block.  This is a one act play (so kind of fitting that it was set in New York City) filmed for the big screen and losing none of its drama with its budget. 
This film was philosophically sound although there are a couple of holes in the plot (i.e. the police not being able to figure things out much sooner).And it's scarier than ""Rear Window"" because it was not Colin Ferrell's character's spying that gets him in trouble, but just living his life. While we are all not wheeler-dealer publicists, who does not have their flaws?  And, what would happen to any one of us, if someone decided we should not live for those flaws?  What would happen if we were faced with death's metaphorical angel?  Could we face our flaws?I can see how action fans would hate the film because there's not a lot of action.  I can see how cinematography snobs would hate the film because it's all shot in a phone booth (although I do admit that some of the real-time split screen work is a little iffy).  But, this movie has all the elements of what drama used to be but with a flair and sensibility that are modern (read the ability to show more gore and grittier situations).Hitchcock was actually offered this film before he died and he turned it down.  I'm almost glad it was made now and not then since this is a gritty story that needed to have no punches pulled (and who better to do gritty drama than the director of ""8MM""?  Once you've tackled snuff films, snipers are hardly more shocking).  It's drama of the highest caliber. 
Possibly the most underrated movie of 2002 due to its mixture of a Hollywood cast and director and non-Hollywood plot (it's a movie both critics and fans are able to hate).",Phone Booth
353,Bjork-is-God,"""He sounded like mid-thirties""",2,11 January 2006,"Stu Sheppard (Farrell) is a fast talking, charismatic, businessman who is forever making deals on his mobile phone. He is cheating everyone; is awkward, eager-to-please assistant, his clients and his wife. Stu stops at an antiquated Manhattan phone booth to chat to his mistress (Holmes). But their planned get together is foiled by a mysterious caller (Sutherland, in an almost unseen role) who is holding Stu captive in this cramped phone booth and threatens to kill him if he doesn't come clean about his sins. After the caller shoots a pimp from an unknown location, the people around believe that Stu himself has shot the man. Things escalate from there; dozens of police and TV crews are eager to know Stu's motives, but little do they know that it in fact an angel of death, brandishing a high-tech gun, which has their fate in his hands. There is pretentiousness and self-indulgence about the caller which I found extremely irritating. The irony that he is cleansing people's sins by committing far worse ones, I found incomprehensible; was it deliberate or just a discrepancy? This is not the only element of the film which I found unconvincing, Stu's wife's motives for example. After she has seen her husband distressed and surrounded by police, she decides to go and chat to the media. Not only that, but she apparently checks Stu's phone bill, what does this say about her? Another plot-hole we are supposed to believe, is that the caller has supposedly set up dozens of microphones throughout the phone booth, in the middle of a Manhattan street, the busiest city in the western world, but no one noticed. Also, we are meant to believe that the gun the killer owns can fire from so many different angles. Notice as the pimp is close to the phone booth how the little red laser pointer is hovering over his heart when he is facing the phone booth, and the caller is apparently aiming from behind and from the other side of the street. How can a gun aim around corners? This film is also quite misogynistic. All the women in this film are foul mouthed street prostitutes, bimbos or complete idiots. Stu's wife is incredibly thick, ""He sounded like mid-thirties"" need I say more. As for Stu's mistress, she is obviously just using his publicity skills to get her in the out of cattle-calls and in to the spotlight. Joel Schumacher, I've never been a fan of. From the clichéd TIGER LAND to the sentimental VERONICA GUERIN. But PHONE BOOTH succeeds in disappointing me the most. He uses novel split screens and the like, which just amounts in run of the mill, pedestrian and generic Hollywood crap. For me, the only (and I do mean ONLY) redeeming feature is Colin Farrell's performance, which proves that he can act, but just has awful taste in scripts.",Phone Booth
354,hanik_1999,Excellent,9,7 April 2003,"A great movie all around.  Very good acting by Colin Farrell and the entire cast.  Kiefer did an amazing job as the voice of the stalker.  Suspenseful from beginning to end, this movie never lost my interest.  The only negative was that the ending came just a bit suddenly, but the FINAL ending was VERY good--no spoilers, but let's just say that I'd say it leaves room for a sequel.  Farrell looks to become a major star.9/10",Phone Booth
355,betterthancantona,Short but a success.,7,17 April 2003,"The first thing that strikes you about this film is the length. I couldn't believe it had finished so quickly at first, but glad in retrospect it used such a style. Farrell is great in this role, I expect to see him in lots of roles like this in the future, (good looking guy in suit, business man, etc) and Sunderland has a perfect and distinctive voice to match. The pair battle it out over the phone, and it looks continually the killer has the upper hand on Farrell. I thought its humour helped the film, and as another reviewer states, 'Is this situation so impossible, in today's modern age?' I think not. Finally, I think the film leaves us with one important notion; Are we grateful and appreciative of what we have and the people around us, and how do we treat other people? All of which, could be taken in a bullet, in a second, if we undervalue them. Keep up the good work in the community Kiether.Overall; Short, but intense and worth a watch. 7/10",Phone Booth

Strange audio (e.g. the god-like deep relaxed  voice of the rifle shooter ... on the phone !). American-style happy ending (yeah, he made it ! yeah !). Overuse of stereotypes (""the corrupt executive"" ... ""who got out of a stock before the little investors"" ... oh how sad.) Crazy sense of right and wrong (a sniper of high morals ...). Big ado just because of an immanent affair of the protagonist (well, very puritan, i guess). Implausible story (how and why did the sniper guy know all this detail about a very insignificant person living his odd little life?) Unconnected camera and film sequences in the beginning (more like a product placement for a certain US phone company.)Gave it a 5 but probably should have given a 4, thinking again.",Phone Booth

It made especially good use of the single location used during the entire film.What really lets it down though is what I consider a pointless and lame ending. When it reaches it's grand finale, I felt thoroughly cheated and as if I had wasted nearly an hour and a half of my life. I was waiting for either the promised ""twist"", maybe something original I'd not seen before, or at least a bit of emotional melodrama, but all I got was a wet blanket. It's a real shame because the project had a lot of promise and with a decent climax could have been really memorable, but this is one I will forget very quickly and goes down as a major disappointment in my book.5/10",Phone Booth
358,actionman133,Colin's great in this very relevant film,8,8 June 2004,"This is definitely an unusual film. It doesn't even run for 80 minutes, the cast can be counted with your hand, and Colin Farrell is on screen for almost every single shot in the movie.That being said, I love this film. As someone who was isolated in the school ground as a child, I often see things with a different perspective. When a kid punches another for calling him an idiot, I thought he was over the top, but the kid thought it was justified. This is the same view taken by our beloved Sniper.Stu Shepherd (Colin Farrell) is a greasy publicist in a flashy suit. He has never made anybody famous, but his clients still follow him because they believe his life of lies. He is trying to get in the sack with Pam (Katie Holmes), his client actress, despite being married to Kelly (Australia's Rahda Mitchell). He calls her from a phone booth each day, but today he has a surprise. He receives a call from a man who constantly threatens to expose him and even kill him if he doesn't co-operate. Stu doesn't even understand why he's targeted, but our caller does, forces Stu to work it out for himself.Stu constantly lies, cheats and weazles his way out of situations. But he accepts this as okay, as does society, but the caller knows that it is never right to do so. Is Stu an innocent victim being terrorized by a maniacal sniper? Or is the sniper his angel trying to get the lying Stu to redeem his sins? I like to believe the latter.We all have a little bit of Stu in ourselves. We all lie a little and think that there will be no consequences. Each time the lies get a little larger, until we lose it.Colin Farrell is amazing to watch in this. He has such an incredible depth and we see him play cocky, paranoid, tragic, comedic and destroyed. All this in 80 minutes; no easy feat. *** SMALL SPOILER *** Kiefer Sutherland does play the sniper well, although I did not find him as menacing as the critics or other viewers ****. All the other characters in the film seem to be quite two dimensional, but the actors playing them give them a sense of grounded reality. Whitaker gives the best supporting performance with the worst character (his marriage-divorce sub-subplot is unnecessary and unresolved).I think this film is a must-see, as it is most relevant today as we hide behind our public image. It boasts a very strong performance from Farrell, a very taut story and some solid direction by Joel Schumacher.8/10",Phone Booth
359,DFG1916,"Vaguely entertaining, but ultimately a waste of time.",4,23 March 2006,"I'll say one thing for this film: it holds your attention. Unfortunately, I found myself regretting that by the time it was over, as the plot line is so stupid, pointless, and utterly implausible that I would really rather have got bored and switched it off early. Most action films require a certain amount of suspension of reason. That's not the problem. The problem is that there is virtually nothing believable in the entire film - from start to finish. The premise is flawed from the outset, and descends into the realms of absurdity from the moment Stu answers the phone. If the sniper had been Godzilla it wouldn't have been any more believable. It exceeded my ""oh come ON"" quota several times over.Furthermore, not since ""Flatliners"" have I seen a film dress up a facile moral message - in this case, basically the Golden Rule - in such ludicrous clothing. I felt afterwards as though I had sat through a(n extraordinarily convoluted) sermon.If you're bored at home and this is on the telly, there's no reason not to put it on.

However, I am a real fan of minimalist movies with single locations or contained thrillers. This one created its containment via the story and it did it so well.I looked at the trivia and could not believe they filmed this in ten days! It has pace and has a story that is credible. Things I didn't like relate to why Farrell didn't find a way to help the cops more? I really did like that he played a sleaze ball and that the sniper had some morals.. great twist.Strong performances all round that keep you glued to the seat.

This film has the most brains I have seen in a thriller since The Silence Of The Lambs. Okay, the language really starts to annoy you, but thats a typical Colin Farrell. Also, the scene where Stu and his wife look at the body of the pizza guy, Stu should have realized that the voice of the pizza guy doesn't match Kiefer Sutherland's husky voice. Colin Farrell's acting is as usual: an arrogant fella who needs a head exam, and Kiefer Sutherland is playing his role as the Caller to his utmost evilest and should be commended, but Forest Whitaker should have been replaced by a talking plank, and that would have been better. That fact aside, this is a great movie and should not be missed by anyone.",Phone Booth

I couldn't identify with the Caller's motivations (so, ok, I guess he's a bit crazy, but perfectly mindful of his actions) and, although the movie did a decent job of developing the characters within the short time afforded, I still didn't care much about them.  Also, there were too many seriously unrealistic scenarios in the movie.  I think this especially hurts a film whose specific theme, filming and acting perspective is ""reality"". 5/10",Phone Booth

I was unfortunate enough to catch this at a friend's house after a BBQ.  The only thing that saved my viewing from being an utter disaster was that I had already heard from another buddy of mine that it was such a terrible movie.  Keeping that in mind, it was fairly entertaining to watch among friends over a few burgers.  I am somewhat surprised to see that the user rating for this movie is so high... of the 9 or 10 people that I watched this with(and discussed our collective disappointment with afterwards), I don't think anyone there would have rated it over a 3 or 4. The back story was nil (of Kiefer's character, in particular); the delivery of about 90% of the dialogue seemed like it had come from the first reading of a high school play, where most of the actors were there only because they had to be to get their fine arts credit; the trim 75 minutes or so (thank goodness it wasn't any longer) seemed like 2 1/2 hours...and the ending was a total let down.  Any hint of suspense was quickly dissolved by the total lack of caring for any of the characters (I found myself hoping many of them would get picked off by Kiefer's character, just to shut them up--or to at least make the story more interesting).  At any rate, I wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone; you'd be better off watching most anything else (except, maybe, for Hard Cash)",Phone Booth

This is not due to some amazing ability, more like learning from repetition due to a lack of original thought in Hollywood.  So many movies have been made it is difficult to spin something original.  Phone Booth, however, has kept to the old standby of KISS.  Keep It Simple Stupid.  This movie is a one stage deal.  Apart from a couple side shots of nondescript locales, the entire movie takes place in a phone booth and the immediate surroundings.  Now this may sound boring to those of us so used to the latest greated special effects but this is fantastic movie.  It is gripping and highly entertaining.  I was shocked that a movie with such little eye candy could capture my attention like it did.  The acting is good, the story is good and the idea is superb.

Well, I did watch anyway, and I loved it :) The good side: As I have said, most of the movie is based inside a phone booth but that didn't get in the way of anything or sounded boring for the least bit...Can't say that it was busting with action, but it had it's thrilling moments. The thoughts expressed in the movie were quite well from all actors (except maybe some of Kelly's remarks). I just love that 'caller guy'. I'm a bit sad about the fact that not much is revealed about him - but oh well... And he survived!! Forest Whitaker did a great job - as in all of his previous acting :) Kiefer Sutherland also acted well enough (in the very short bit he's seen), but I'm not quite sure that did quite match his profile - according to me...The bad side: Certain concepts of the movie were somewhat unrealistic... The police were quite slow and unresponsive... The fact that he's locked up in there for the whole movie - I'm not sure about that either. Furthermore, what do Stu Shepard's crimes have to do with the other crimes of the previous mentioned victims... The porn guy and the executive's motives were very much different than his... I'm not sure one would target Stu for such little crimes - but I must say that I loved the part where he admitted to his 'crimes'. Ohh, and one more thing... I DID NOT like the beginning and the ending of the movie... It should have started without that strange-and-unrelated song, and it shouldn't ended with all the calls being made... What if it ended with 'caller' guy moving away and Stu crying 'help'...A great movie! I really recommend watching :) A well-planned and executed movie...

It's only saving grace is Colin Farrell's game performance, while the rest of the cast look like extras from a bad episode of Kojak, including the most cliched police captain ever.

They both have that unique visual look. The very beginning reminded me of Unbreakable. The best thing in Phone Booth is that it actually has nothing wrong. It's perfectly done, actors look and sound realistic and the set looks as real as it could really exist somewhere there in Manhattan (and actually it does, right?). The movie gives you two plot twists in the end. Just when you thought it was over... Look again. And again. Hard to believe it's the same director as in Batman & Robin.

I thought that there would be no way that the entire film could take place in a phone booth without it dragging on. I was proved wrong. I liked this movie a lot. It was not at all boring how I first assumed it would be.This is actually a very good movie. The story kept me interested throughout the whole film. It was very suspenseful. It seemed the further the movie progressed that yet another dilemma would arise forcing the main character to make a difficult decision that his life depended on.The story was good but a story alone cannot carry a movie if the acting is bad. I feel that the cast could not have been more perfect for this movie. Colin Farrell did an excellent job as the main character. He flawlessly portrayed the wide range of emotions that his role demanded. Forest Whitaker was great as the police captain that had to maintain control of an escalating situation while trying to discover the real reason behind it. Kiefer Sutherland was perfect for the voice on the phone. He sounded determined and in control and came off as truly chilling at times. Radha Mitchell did a good job as Farrell's wife. She truly seemed very concerned and loving throughout. Katie Holmes had a minor part but was great as a sweet and innocent girl that was oblivious to Farrell's intentions.

He pumps the public image of his clients in order to make it appear that he is doing a favour to venues when they decide to host his clients. I have no sympathy for him. The rep enters a phone booth to make a call to his mistress. He only calls her from this specific phone booth because he doesn't want a paper trail. I have less sympathy for him. What we have is a MAJOR break in logic. Mr. sniper-man decides that he must teach Mr. Sleezeball a lesson about fidelity while having no qualms whatsoever in shooting completely innocent bystanders.

I have several gripes about this flick but I'll stick to one more at this time: A handgun fired at the chest of an individual will not leave a similar wound as a high-powered sniper rifle fired at the back of an individual!

378,patoguru,Simple but Effective,10,22 April 2003,"I gave this movie a perfect score.  I am convinced that, at times when successful movies seem to be closely correlated to special effects, Phone Booth breathes some fresh air as a very simple - yet effective - movie. I have a hard time looking back and finding memories of movies built around such a simple concept as a life threatening situation going on during a public phone conversation, relying on nothing else than an acute sense of characterization.  Farrell is magnificent as a wannabe-scam-artist ... and the voice on the other end of the line is at times terrifying and at times frighteningly real. Farrell's ""Stu"" goes through many changes throughout the story ... from arrogance to guilt to fear, all masterfully portrayed. As a final comment, I'll say that the underlying logic of the plot is the fear - that we all have felt at some point - that we're being watched and followed.  That alone is a very strong argument for creating a chef d'oeuvre as this.  Don't miss it!",Phone Booth
379,exnzz,Artfully done,8,23 July 2003,"Warning possible spoiler This is a thrilling drama for adults who can handle the mature subject matter... This intense drama, which takes place in and around a single phone booth in New York City, a man who is being watched by a killer with a sniper rifle must use the phone to save his life. The Caller with his god complex was out to force Shepard to repent and redeem himself of his sins against all those to whom he had lied, especially to Kelly and Pamela. Redemption of our sins is possible only through the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ, but at least it is a choice [Heb. 5:9]. Redemption, as vain as it might be, at gunpoint is not. This film was artfully done...in addition to being gripping and artfully done, the film makes moral statements that reflect Scriptural truth.Your sin will find you out (Num. 32:23). What a man sows he shall reap (Gal. 6:7). Marital fidelity means being faithful in thought as well as deed (Matt. 5:27-28. I liked the scene where the Caller blows apart a street small toy robot near the base of the phone booth. Stu picked up parts of the toy, making it appear Stu destroyed the toy. The vendor demanded Stu pay for the toy. To avoid the vendor getting involved and possibly killed, Stu paid for it. Though he did not have to pay for he wasn't the one who shot the toy. He did for the vendor's sake, not his own. Much like Jesus paid for our sins without ever having sinned Himself. Jesus did not have to pay the price of our sins, but He did [Matt. 26:53]. For our sakes, not His own.",Phone Booth
380,flick_p,Wicked,10,8 May 2003,What a film! I must admit i wasnt too optimistic when i realised it was going to be set in a phone booth throughtout the film but hey it suprised me! The suspense is quite intense and i did hear a few people in the cinema gasp along with me - the twist at the end is also fantastic! A start performance by all involved especially Colin Farrell! 10/10,Phone Booth
381,lfl,Quite average..,7,15 May 2003,"Not a scintillating film by any means but an interesting enough idea.. There is some tension that gently builds as the film progresses but  the tight scenario eventually becomes a little monotonous. However it is quite a satisfying film that leaves one feeling a little wary about any phonebooth. I'm glad I saw the film but would have reservations recommending it to anyone especially as the dialogue had a little too much bad language. I can't help thinking the producers nearly got there, but missed an opportunity to make this quite average film outstanding.",Phone Booth
382,Dante_Incarnate441,Alot better than it looked,9,13 August 2003,"I was reluctant to see this film the first time i had the oppritiunity to watch it, mainly because of the trailers inability to grasp my attention. The concept of a man stuck in a phone booth seemed shallow to me.
however....I did eventually watch it, and I have to say that I was tottaly impressed. In short, it was alot better than it looked. The film turned out to be a gripping suspense thriller, and in no way shallow. The caller turned out to be a beter antagonist than I could have imagined, and Collin Ferrel delivers a powerful performance as he is whittlled down by the all knowing Caller.
The only negative points are the over use of curse words, and the occational continuity problem (you'll notice it, trust me) But those points aside, this movie is without a doubt a must see.9/10",Phone Booth
383,cbeamer-1,AMAZING MOVIE -- Farrell and Schumacher Should Make All Films Together,10,20 March 2003,"An out of the ball-park thriller, with Joel Schumacher knocking this one past anything he has ever done.  Colin Farrell is beyond amazing, and it's about time he has a movie worthy of the talent this guy has.  Absolutely, edge-of-the-seat, nail-bitting, thriller, and this is how movies should be made.  Like they used to be without garbage, without fluff, and with brilliant directing, a solid script, and SUPERB performance by Colin and supporting cast.  Cannot say enough good things about this movie.  A 9 1/2 and that is hard for me to say.  Most movies this day mult-task, they both stink and bore.",Phone Booth
384,lewiswill,A terrible terrible movie,1,24 November 2004,"Phone Booth really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen - one of those ones that leads to resentment due to having paid for the ticket. Had I known what Phone Booth would actually be like, I would have required payment to attend the movie. Phone Booth's plot is simplistic and involves unnecessary and boring violence and cruelty. It is clear throughout that those who created the movie thought that its ideas were very interesting and thoughtful - really this is an example of indulgence of the worst kind, akin to Matrix II and III (dare I say it) - fun for movie-makers but painful for audiences. None of the characters are endearing and there is no subtlety or anything remotely attractive or memorable. The voice of the ""baddy"" is that ""scary person"" voice used in so many American movies (such as Scream etc) - very tacky. I strongly discourage people from watching this movie - 0/10.",Phone Booth
385,TKgamer5000,A smart and intense thriller!,9,8 April 2005,"Being a fan of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Birds"", followed by M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"", the idea of thrillers had taken on a new logic in my mind. The idea is that the victims are trapped in a small claustrophobic atmosphere and the impending doom is right outside; its no wonder that I was drawn right into Joel Schumacher's ""Phone Booth"". What really sets this movie apart from the many thrillers like it was that the impending doom itself comes right into this claustrophobic booth and torments Colin Farrell's character to the point of pure unsaturated fear. The cinematography captured my eye as well, that when showing multiple shots at a time, it displays all the observations and thoughts of a person in a situation like that. These thoughts transform into the paranoid vision of this person trapped by a verbally sadistic gunmen with a rifle barrel focused right at his head. The dialogue is witty and suspenseful, especially in Kiefer Sutherlands character, that with every line it becomes more and more intriguing, and therefore the duologue itself becomes an element of terror which builds and builds throughout the movie. Colin Farrell delivers an incredible performance, he captures perfectly the realistic and natural reactions of any type person stuck in a death threat dilemma. All in all, a great, intense and addictive movie to watch.",Phone Booth
386,bostonboy,Entertaining and full of suspense!,8,7 July 2005,"This is the kind of movie that is rare these days. It didn't cost an arm and a leg to make, it stars some good actors and the story line was plausible.The Hitchcock influence is obvious and the pacing of the film was just right. This is the best work of director Schumacher. The lead could have been played by any yuppie looking actor but Colin Farrell does a good job anyway in a role that puts you in his character's place.It's hard to make a movie work when it takes place in a confined space with few characters, but when those movies succeed, it shows.

It gets you interested when it lasts but leaves you wondering what it was all about. I mean the plot wasn't very original, so as pure entertainment the movie isn't too exciting. As for its possible ""message"", well... There are self-centered cynical men who like women. I knew that before. There are psychopaths who like to play God. I knew that before. You can have a mistress on the side and still love your wife. I knew that before. In some circumstances you may be very sorry for all pleasant things you've done.

I will only say that this movie may please some of the people (as evidenced by all the PR puff reviews placed on this site) but it has story holes you could ride an elephant  through.

Their isn't really a lot of killing in this movie and it doesn't need that. What's entertaining in this film is the caller taunting stu through the whole movie. Stu tries to find away to get out through the whole movie which is also very entertaining. It's amazing that the whole movie takes place in a phone booth and is entertaining.

395,francy1983,a breathtaking experience,10,21 April 2011,"This is one of my favourite movies ever: a pretty simple plot that gets really exciting. Thanks to the great job of director Joel Schumacher, who manages to glue the audience to their seats by turning a potential tedious situation into a ticking bomb, ready to explode. Thanks to the great job of the actors: Colin Farrell, whose performance is so intense that it makes you feel like you share the space of the phone booth with him (one should be so lucky!); Forest Whitaker, who brilliantly gives life to a troubled character who saves the day; Radha Mitchell, the poor unaware main character's wife; last but not least, the screen-filling voice of the sniper: the actor's ability to keep it warm and ice-cold at the same time makes it impossible to turn your eyes away from the screen. Very interesting is the fact the the plot develops in real time and the extensive use of the split screen to show us what happens not only in the phone booth, but all around it. The combination of all these elements makes of ""Phone booth"" a breathtaking movie: just put yourself in a comfortable seat, watch it and savour it!",Phone Booth

The acting was great, but it is difficult to have a full length feature film with a single location.  You see, in Speed, even though most of the movie was on the bus, the intro and finale were in other locations, and there were flashes to other primary characters throughout the film.  The stagnant nature of the setting made the movie a little tough to watch, but, all in all, a positive experience.

Sure, it took guts to make a movie that's mostly all dialog and takes place in a very small location, but you still have to make a good movie too.  See My Dinner with Andre if that's what you want.I feel the movie totally abuses the soundtrack to add suspense with the beating heart crescendos.  And if you are the kind of person that finds yourself yelling at the screen when dumb characters miss obvious solutions, I wouldn't see this movie.For example (***SPOILERS AHEAD***) if you hear the shooter has to pump the rifle, then run after he shoots something.

My wife asked me the same thing when I told her I had just seen an amazing film. I said it was based on a phone box. Of course, if you haven't seen this film or know about it your first question would probably be the same. ""How can this film be about a phone box for over an hour?"" Its doesn't transport you into a matrix, nor will it have flashbacks that take vast chunks of time. Its very simple its a carefully well constructed script that took just under two weeks to film.This film gets a perfect 10 from me simply because the careful way the story is told and unrolls.The Director knew EXACLTY (yes in caps) EXACTLY (I'll say it again as this point needs to be highlight) what they were doing and how it should be done.Suspense ?! Damn I think I lost circulation in my legs from not moving a very rare thing in films these days - it will have you wondering whats happening next or how.You will find your mind playing out the situation and trying to next step the plot.This film, cast, director and script are truly what films are about.",Phone Booth

I couldn't care less what would happen to arrogant Colin Farrell. So the reasons behind it all ""would be a sausage to me (dutch joke)"".Also the famous voice on the phone told me right away ""that's mister Kiefer Sutherland"".

When I read what the movie was about, it told me this, 'guy trapped in phone booth' after watching the trailer, 'guy trapped in phone booth because of sniper'. Now what kind of storyline is that? That was the whole movie, there is no action whatsoever, whole -->1<-- hour (really, a cartoon is longer than that.) movie based on a (1) guy that is pinned down by a sniper. same location, for 80 minutes. it wasn't thrilling, it was BORING. ya, the only thing that was good about the movie is the some-what boring conversation. (all the movie is about.) there was no more point to watching it after you see it for 20 minutes, you will KNOW what it will be still. all the police that was there was standing around looking like idiots, i mean common, at least one guy should point out, ""maybe it is because he is trapped there"" well after 79.9 minutes of total conversation, the sniper is finally kicked out of the building by SWAT.

Just stating my opinion. Okay...I'll state it for the record...I'm not a huge Colin Farrell fan. I didn't like him in the Recruit. He didn't have much of a role in the first Daredevil, so nothing really bad to say there, just kind of a boring role. He also didn't do much for me in Minority Report. Kiefer Sutherland was incredible in this movie. It's easy to show emotions on the screen when you have an audience to play it up for, but to only be a voice on a phone line makes it so much more difficult. Now, don't get me wrong...I saw some emotions from Colin Farrell...as opposed to his normal hurt puzzlement (that's what I call his one and only emotion), but Sutherland was incredible. And, regardless of my feelings, I did think the movie was better than average..well worth a matinee price at a movie theater, but not worth the evening $8.50.",Phone Booth

It's not the worst film I've seen by far, though you can only really expect to take a limited idea so far before it levels out and turns to boredom and frustration.Highlight of the movie? It's got to be the hilarious hookers harassing Farrell at the start.One other thought, this must have been the cheapest Hollywood movie to film ever, seeing as it's all literally shot in a phonebooth...",Phone Booth

foul-mouthed junk of a movie. Made no sense from the beginning such as when the prostitutes desperately wanted to use the phone booth that the character Stu was using, when in NYC there were plenty at that time. Then the women got their pimp to get Stu out of the phone booth, the latter gave the pimp over a hundred dollars but that wasn't enough to appease him, and so he subsequently went to physically assault Stu anyways. During the course of that whole interaction with all the characters involved dozens of expletives were liberally thrown around for no reason.

The movie is 80 mins long, but they didn't take more than five minutes to develop his character. Anyone that has seen People I Know has seen a publicist live a fast paced life that leaves little room for caring for other people, etc. At least in Al Pacino's case he still made a somewhat endearing character.Some kind of twist at the end, perhaps Stu's evil past would have made this a better story. The caller was supposed to be a crazy vigilante, but he just kills an innocent guy on the street so Stu would eventually tell his wife that he is a loser. At least kill a guy for some good reason if you are trying to pass moral judgment.Phone Booth was a unique film, but overall didn't quite give me what I was looking for, 6/10.",Phone Booth

The movie starts out with an unlikely PR guy (Colin Farrell) who cares about no one but himself getting stuck in a phone booth talking to a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland).  The movie's attempts at suspense are continuously interrupted by corny one-liners in Sutherland's script, which effectively leave viewers bored out of their minds.

Colin Farrell really does make you feel nervous for him, so that is why the movie gets some stars. BUT, the ending is just awful. To bring in some unknown character who is the bad guy, and have him walk away is disappointing. the movie leaves you guessing what his motive was, and the part of the pizza guy is just plain stupid. I was also disappointed by the way his wife so easily forgave him. She seemed to have no problem with him cheating on her. Need some more character development from people not named Stu.Just another thing to add, the hookers in the beginning are just flat out annoying. People don't act like that. If you see someone making a phone call, and at the time he had only been in there for a few minutes, you don't get annoyed and attack the booth. That just made no sense. So to sum up, it was at time exciting to watch, but the ending was so bad, and the movie was much worse than the trailer made it seem.",Phone Booth

You wouldn't want to devote a second of your time during the course of this movie to make a trip to the men's room, or refill that $8 coke bottle you guzzled down during the previews. Joel Schumacher did a magnificant job keeping you glued to your seat by focusing the cameras on that single phone booth and its surroundings. Though there are some obvious flaws during the course of this movie, it surely pleased the heck out of me. Colin Farell delivers a strong and at some point, sensative performance which may not be an oscar contender, but I must sure as hell give him credit for it. Equally, all the other actors are mediocre and above.If you have nothing to do on a friday night, go spend the $10+ and catch this flick, you sure as hell won't regret it.7.5/10",Phone Booth

And when I went to the cinema yesterday, I wasn't disappointed.'Phone Booth' was, in my opinion, good from the beginning (despite the annoying song played in the start). The facts about using telephones in NYC was interesting. And when Stu Shepard appeared, my first reaction was a big sigh and a thought filled my head ""I'll be able to look at that guy for the next 1½ hours"".And the movie just got better. I was actually horrified about the killer, and when Stu told all his secrets to all the people, cops and TV, I (though I'm pretty embarrassed to admit) started to cry.The movie ended well and the plot didn't have any flaws.

It is full of beaten clichés, poorly acted, and technically mediocre. The leading character's obnoxious personality is so over-dramatic and over-done, it is practically embarrassing to watch. All characters behave completely histrionically, it is tiring and silly. I was excited when reading the reviews about this movie and dragged a friend to see it with me. Let me tell you, I was never quite so embarrassed in a long time. The mediocrity's broad strokes didn't even spare the little technical details - like the omni-present red laser aiming spot - I mean, practically everyone known what a laser pointer spot looks like, and it definitely doesn't look like a maroon paint spot with low luminance, which doesn't even shake in the movie.",Phone Booth

I was a little curious as to how 81 minutes in a phone booth could be exciting, but this movie definitely help my attention.Colin Farrell as the lying publicist Stu Shepherd is absolutely AMAZING! If anyone had any doubts as to whether or not he could act, GO SEE THIS MOVIE! He does a brilliant job of transforming from the cocky, self-absorbed publicist to a desperate guy breaking down. Everything, especially the part where he is confessing and breaking down, seems completely real and not scripted. Prior to seeing this movie, I wasn't sure if Colin Farrell was just another pretty face, but now I can see that he is most definitely an extremely talented actor.  Kiefer Sutherland, as the Caller, was also amazing. His voice is perfect for the part and almost makes you shiver when you first hear it. Forest Whitaker, likewise, was very good for his role. However, it was Farrell who stole the show - which is good, since he's the one alone on the screen for the majority of the movie. SPOILER ALERT The movie was not ALL suspense and sitting on the edge of your seat. There were a fewhumorous moments, especially with the hookers, which were good to ease a little bit of the suspense. *SPOILER ALERT* I thought that the ""pretend shooting"" at the end was a very good thing to add - it took some predictability out of the ending. *END OF SPOILERS* While the ending was slightly disappointing, it was also a pretty good way to end the movie. It seemed to leave it open for a sequel, but I have no clue how on earth this amazing movie could be followed up.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE IN SEARCH OF A GOOD THRILLER! 10 out of 10!",Phone Booth

Some have criticized it for a lack of creativity (though I don't know if they have on this site), but i think it's an original idea with a deep meaning that I wont give away. Joel,the director, also uses some really cool techniques to show several actions at the same time. Also when someone is making a phone call we see the the person they are talking in a small rectangle on the screen. I love this movie it is the best! Go see it when it comes out!

There were so many police procedural problems that I had to laugh. How does his wife keep getting out of the back of a cruiser? (if she can do it, so can a suspect) Why would they allow her at the scene? Why does Forrest Whitaker immediately offer to disarm himself? After all is said and done, why are people allowed to roam freely through a crime scene?
Colin Farrell's acting is fair but his accent is horrible. Keifer Sutherland provides a great voice for the sniper, but his character's motivations should have been developed more. I like the idea of a man pinned down by a sniper that can't hang up the phone. It's just almost everything else about this movie that I don't like.",Phone Booth

Every time you think you see a loophole in the story, it is explained.  The only problem I had with the film was the ending, but because of the general story, I suppose the writers painted themselves into a corner, and however the movie ended, it would disappoint some people.Oh, hell, all in all, I strongly suggest you go see it, it's great, but don't expect any big action flick cliches (fast cars, explosions, boobies...)",Phone Booth

The movie itself was excellently put together and you think Colin Farrel would have some kind of higher impact on the female viewers. That's my shallow reasoning, but even so, the movie was believable unlike many movies that put average people in intense situations, and the dialogue was written and played well enough that had the rest of the movie been weak it would have been worth seeing. No doubt in my mind this movie is a keeper for DVD and getting a high recommendation for theater goers. A+",Phone Booth

At first I thought that it wouldn't be able to hold my attention for too long, but surprisingly enough, I stayed focused and connected to the plot throughout the duration of the movie. I thought that this movie was casted very well, in that I believed that Colin Farrel portrayed the role of the arrogant publicist who realizes the truth about himself. On a similar note, I thought that Forest Whitaker's part as as the cool and composed police chief was a good fit for him. As always, Kiefer Sutherland provides the movie with its share of yelling and intense drama. *FINAL REPORT* I give this movie a 8.5/10.",Phone Booth

While you take your time to go through them, here, the villain, keeps you busy watching the film. He only has a voice in the film, except at last where he shows himself up, still I'd say, his acting is GOOD! Mysterious, killer voice, perfectly suited for the role. The main role is also portrayed very well, and as the film advances, we get to know each and every ounce of his character, both bad and good. His acting deserves a praise. A good mystery.

I thought it was great filmmaking, and it was a superb thriller.  The arguments I've heard for why this movie isn't good is: 1)It's predictable 2)There's not enough character development 3)There's too much swearingFor #1, I agree that it is somewhat predictable, but I didn't think the predictable part was really the significant twist or crux of the movie or the ending.For #2, this movie is not about Stu's wife or love interest, so their characters don't need developing.  This is all about Stu and the life he's been leading, so it needed only introduce his lifestyle, give it history and a dramatic change, and it did just that, quite well in my opinion.For #3, It's a movie set in REAL New York, not a Hollywood-style New York that families can sit down and experience it together.  There's cussing (lots), there's hookers, and there's unwholesomeness.  It helped make the movie seem much more real and gave it an edgy style.For me, this movie is #4 on my all-time list, and I easily give it an A+ grade.",Phone Booth
433,hhmrsm,Just Saw This Last Night...,7,1 August 2006,"I have only recently become a Colin Farrell fan not initially based on his movie performances but recent interviews - my favorite being the interview on the Today Show where he calls Matt Lauer ""glib"" in reference to Lauer's interview with Tom Cruise ( I will refrain from commenting on Mr.Cruise at this juncture). I have seen At Home at the End of the World and Minority Report. I bought Phone Booth after reading several reviews here and I really liked it- not never ending love- but a strong like. My impression of the movie is that it was supposed to be a tight suspenseful story that kept you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. If I am right, it did its job. Other reviewers mentioned a twist at the end, but it didn't feel very twisty to me. It was entertaining, very effective escapist stuff. Definitely made me forget about my day at the office. And does Keifer Sutherland have the perfect psycho nut job voice or what? I loved Colin Farrell's performance, I really believed that he was the integrity impaired PR person that he played, and I really believed that the experience in the phone booth made him want to mend his ways- for a couple of hours at least.",Phone Booth

Now, it's one of my favorite thrillers. A lot of people I know avoided it because it seemed like a non-starter, like you couldn't go anywhere with it, but because of the razor-sharp directing and clever script, it goes more places than most Hollywood thrillers can ever hope to. Colin Farrell is incredible (watch for his monologue, it's spectacular) and Keifer Sutherland, whose voice is heard throughout, provides an exceedingly charismatic villain. See it, you won't regret it.",Phone Booth
435,leaper8757,SAW for the thinking man,9,28 October 2011,"Without giving too much away, this film has parallels with the SAW series of movies, in that it deals with people owning up and taking responsibility for their actions. Where it differs is that it doesn't rely on gratuitous gore to get the message across and hold the audience's interest. Instead, it is a taut, tense psychological thriller that draws you in and holds you. The confines of the phone booth which constitute almost the entire setting would at first seem to make for a dull movie, but in fact it adds to the atmosphere to the extent that it almost becomes another character in the story. When it comes to movies, I am pretty easy to please. I am content to check my brain at the door for a couple of hours and be entertained. But I am very hard to impress. Sometimes, I like a good movie that will make me think, and make me want to watch it again. This movie impressed me.",Phone Booth
436,DaveBlanchard59,You Got Stu,9,16 November 2007,"The movie is extremely well-crafted (beginning with the perfect foreshadowing of Colin Farrell's way of answering his calls), extremely well-acted (Farrell's performance is indelible, and probably overlooked by the Academy), and relentless in its harrowing irony of inhuman killer as avenging angel. Or is it guardian angel...has Farrell's character been given a second chance, for some reason? Stuart at least proves himself worthy of that second chance, in chancing with his life, finally offering it, for others. Roger Ebert called it a morality play; perhaps it is, one on steroids--Judgment Day, midweek, Manhattan. The movie is a minefield, leaving nothing, and everything, to the imagination.",Phone Booth
437,rastachucker19,A movie that proves that a good story makes a movie not the locations,8,30 May 2005,"Phone Booth: This is one of those rare movies that proves you don't need a ton of locations to make a good movie. This movie has one main location which sounds like it would be boring except the exceptional camera and acting keep from this. Stuart Shepard play by Colin Farrell is the guy pinned down in the phone booth by a sniper play by Kiefer Sutherland. Without giving anything away to those who have not seen it is gets more intense from there. I think the fact that this movie only had one main location added to the intensity of the movie which moved along quite nicely. Some have told me they thought it was slow in pace but I thought it move along quite well. Now it is not one of my top movies,but it is one that I would watch again after it had been awhile. I think the movie is one that shows you don't need anything more than good acting and decent story to make a good movie.Which is why I liked it. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for something different than your normal thriller. The reason I gave it an eight is that it does not have rewacth ability which is typical of these kind of movies. The suspense factor is in the not knowing what is going to happen next which fades when seen a ton of times. These are not the kind of movies I would buy unless it was something above and beyond or super cheap like on VHS.",Phone Booth

The ""Voice"" of the caller the other side, given by Keifer Sutherland impresses much. Its a different kind of a movie and that's what I love to watch.The movie grows all the more interesting with time and keeps you hold fast to your chair. Excitement is always at the apex and you are always wonder what will happen next. Definitely a must watch! Acting of Colin Farrell and voice of Keifer Sutherland makes the scene alive.Acting performances by all other characters in the movie is also good and Katie Holmes looks pretty in the movie. The entire movie is taken at one place just like 12 Angry Men and Locke. I love this kind of movie and its always a pleasure to watch something new like that.",Phone Booth
439,Photo-3,what a strange little film!,6,19 August 2003,"What a strange little film this is!  I cannot decide whether or not to like it or hate it.What you have is an amoral publicist, Stu, (played EXCEPTIONALLY well by Colin Farrell) who, one day, finds himself sighted by a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) when he calls a woman from a phone booth to have an extramarital affair. Kiefer Sutherland decides that force must be used to correct the amoral peoples walking the street.What conflicts me about this movie is that it is not clear what it tries to be and how to resolve it.  This movie is packed with suspense, yet the ending leaves the viewer dissatisfied on many levels.  It is very hard to empathize with the sniper who wants to correct Stu's behavior in an, albeit, misguided way.  Yet, it is very difficult to empathize with Stu, whose only fault is the interest in having an affair.  It is never established if he actually intends to carry through with this.  As such, the viewer is left wondering who the real good guy is: the sniper who wants Stu to become honest with people? or Stu - who never has actually had any moments of indiscretion?  Perhaps it is the Officer (Forrest Whitaker) who gets emotionally victimized by the sniper, in some ways, more so than Stu?If you want to see a really well done movie where good guys go on random murder sprees to kill bad men, then i would strongly recommend ""The Boondock Saints"".  The suspense of this movie will entertain you for the 1hr 30 min run time (which is more like 1 hr 10 min without credits.)  My lingering question is this: It is a shame that Hitchcock is not alive to have seen this film.  I can't help thinking that he would have done a phenomenal job touching up the story...and am intrigued to guess at what scene he would've had his requisite cameo in... :)summary: For mindless suspense, thumbs up.  For anything else, thumbs down. I give it a 6/10.",Phone Booth
440,mpcd,"Nothing special, mildly entertaining at best",5,6 April 2003,"I'm not sure exactly why so many IMDB user comments are praising this film. It was entertaining at times and had potential to be quite gripping, but I found it to be typical Hollywood mediocrity. Nothing was particularly inventive about the film, although the premise certainly should have been adequate enough to make a good B flick out of. I wasn't expecting much when I went to see this movie, but I got even less. The attempts at suspense were noble, but left much to be desired. There was nothing particularly wrong with Colin Farrell's performance, although he needs to stop doing Schumacher films if he wants to go somewhere with his career. Forest Whitaker's performance was dismal and disappointing (I normally like him). The dialog was ok but the concept was just plain stupid. I have no idea why Stu had so much trouble admitting his ""sins"" to his wife and to Pamela (Katie Holmes), especially at gunpoint. I also have no idea why Whitaker's character was so feeble and easily manipulated by some guy who is sweating profusely in a phone booth -- I thought he was supposed to be a New York police captain.
Overall this movie had very few suspenseful moments or clever lines, I don't recommend it to anyone until it comes to home video rental.",Phone Booth

There were no surprises, and every move was carefully telegraphed well ahead of time. The characters were all based firmly on very old, very tired cliches, so I suppose the filmmakers didn't feel the need to try to make them more than one-dimensional. To describe the movie as ""predictable"" would be generous. In the hands of a Hitchcock, this could have been an excellent film. In the hands of Schumacher, it's just dreck.",Phone Booth

This is a nicely crafted piece of moviemaking. A different approach than your average thriller makes it worth seeing. You never know which way the story's going to turn. Moreover, it's kept this unpredictable all the way to the end.

The acting by Colin Farrell and Keifer Sutherland was great, and what scenes the movie did have where done well... It just needed more. 5/10I would not spend $9 to see it.

Then again, with only a 10 day film shoot, you can't have much time to think through whether this is a film that should actually come into existence. even the cast doesn't boast any superb acting ability (Forest Whitaker can be perfectly amazing and at times perfectly horrible). for anyone to think that you could make a good movie out of a lousy plot such as a man being made to stay in a phone booth and such a quick film shoot can't believe in good film-making of any kind. all in all it wasn't surprising how flat Collin Farrell's acting was and certainly wasn't surprising that a plot with a man stuck in a phone booth turned out to be 80 minutes of nothing but a man stuck in a phone booth. now if you like watching guys in phone booths then this is your movie, if not, don't bother. the betrayal this commits against thrillers is a crying shame, the sad truth when a movie is brought into existence in such a hurried fashion is that it cannot be of any true noteworthy value. film making takes time and effort, something very lacking in this attempt at film.",Phone Booth

He put it in, and I watched. Never in a million years did I expect what I got. It was tense, deep, and relyed on the dialogue to continue the story, and by god, there was a story. Unusual for a modern Hollywood movie. Sutherland is a great bad guy who keeps sweet talking Farrel on his toes as he flings him reason after reason for him to end his life, not have I seen such a great performance of a voice since Jeremy Irons in Die Hard with a Vengeance, playing Simon the bomber.

Best I could tell he was deceptive and was thinking about fooling around on his wife (but never did) - he gets the daylights knocked out of him by the pimp, but amazingly there are no marks on his face when he is done! - The voice over for the sniper - sounds like he is speaking through a stereo, not on a pay phone - The pizza guy as a killer?

457,RoxyInc19,Phone Booth does for payphones what Scream did for home phones,10,17 February 2003,"Set entirely within and around the confines of a New York City phone booth, Phone Booth is a quick paced as you're going to get. What sets this film apart from anything I've ever seen is that the audience is constantly on the same page as the main character, Stuart and much like Stuart the audience feels the chill as the caller on the other line omniously warns Stuart not to hang up.What is most effective about Phone Booth is that the audience never sees the caller on the other line which is brilliantly played by Kiefer Sutherland. As the voice of the sniper, Sutherland adds a level of intensity and angst that makes the viewer feels as if they themselves are on the phone. Colin Farrell delivers a remarkable performance as the movie's tortured hero who finds his life at a standstill the moment he picks up that phone. He goes through a transformation from an introlerable jerk to a nervous, complacent to a distraught man who is watching his worst nightmare come to life.
Phone Booth works particularly because of Kiefer and Colin who are, simply put, engaging in this film, but with an original premise like the one planted here, you'll think twice about answering the phone on the corner.",Phone Booth
458,Brobert2,A real psychological thriller,10,12 April 2003,"SPOILER!!!! If seeing human emotion really sways you, you'll love this movie. It's light on the action side, so if that's what you need, don't bother with this movie. Granted, there is some action, but for the most part its talking.Phone Booth is about Stu Shepard, a publicist who gets into a phone booth to call one of his clients, whom in truth Stu only helps so he can cheat on his wife with her. However, after hanging up, he gets a call from a man who seems to know about his toying with the client, amongst other things. When Stu tries to leave, the caller tells him he has a gun and will kill him if he hangs up. Soon, a local pimp, enraged that Stu will not let his hookers use the booth, tries to smash down the booth. Just as he is about to get to Stu, the caller shoots the pimp, which is interpreted by the unknowing crowd as a shot from Stu. The police soon arrive and the caller twists with Stu's head while the police try to figure out what is going on.This movie really plays with your emotions. The caller is not your typical psycho, he is really a good man out on a mission. Each moment becomes more suspenseful and the end is really impactful. This movie, in my opinion, is the best display of human fear ever to hit the screen. Everything feels real and not scripted. 10/10.",Phone Booth

This is the first movie that ever really put me on the edge of my seat. I mean seriously I was on the edge of my seat in the car at the local drive-in, it was really that good. And I stayed in suspense, stayed on the edge of my seat until the credits started. Colin Farrell was amazing in this, and should be remembered when it comes time for Oscar nominations. Also I believe they got the perfect person to be The Caller. His voice was perfect for it. This is a must-see for anyone who enjoys a good movie!",Phone Booth

It was truly a delight from beginning to end. The tension was heightened by the ""real time"" of the film. The cast was great-I loved the unrehearsed feel to the movie. The writing was superb. But the high light of the film had to be the direction which was excellent. I tell you, the premise is soooo simple. It is the direction which keeps you on the edge of your seat. The use of the picture in picture technique gives the film a rare quality. It feels like a very small film but it packs a very large punch.",Phone Booth

I left the theater as satisfied as I could be. Colin Farrel did a stunning job as Stu Shepard, a publicist living it up in New York, who basically makes a living by lieing. He finds him self in the worst position possible as he is now trapped in a phone booth on 8th avenue with a man pointing a sniper rifle at him. Now this movie has got its twists, and its turn. But I just had one problem with the ending... I predicted it. Right from the begining with the pizza man, I had a feeling the end would involve him. But I knew it couldnt be him, being as home his voice and the man on the telephone had different voices (sure maybe he couldve had a voice changer thing..but no). When they lift the blanket to show who the killer was, and when it shows it the pizza man, your going to know it wasnt him. I wasnt suprised at all to have the man show up outside the ambulance, saying good bye to Stu. However, all in all, I thought this was actually one of my top 5 favorite movies of the year. 8/10",Phone Booth

I will say that i am huge fan of Colin's, i think he is an amazing actor, and in this movie he really shows what he can do. The accent is a little weak, but you have to forgive him, the guy's Irish. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. It doesn't feel short because it moves in real time and so it would ruin the movie, i think, had it not run in real time, it adds a lot to the movie. By the end of the movie you really feel for colin's character, even though Katie Holmes character and his wife, kelly, aren't that great, Colin really carries the movie. The style is creative and really fits the movie and even if you think the story is a little far fetched, it'll probably suprise you for how good it really is.

This movie is so tense and captivating, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.The acting is top notch, the direction is wonderful, the camera use is spectacular.  Multiple windows not unlike ""24"" show different angle of the same shot or multiple characters at the same time.Colin Farrell is extraordinary in this role.  He shows a wide range of emotions as the film progresses and each of them is completely convincing.Kiefer Sutherland is the only person with the voice able to pull off this role.  He was fabulous, despite his visual absence from the film.If you have a chance to see this movie, take it.  It is definitely one of the year's best.",Phone Booth

A freakin guy in a phone booth being held hostage by a sniper (that's cool) Listing to him talk on the phone for an hour was annoying.

I was hoping for twists (SPOILER i.e. the wife had done something bad and was the real target, and the whole film was a send up to that act; I mean come on - was his character really that flawed to warrant this action against him... he lied to people?

469,NietzscheStudent,Stellar Performances Across the Board,10,5 April 2003,"Joel Schumacher's film 'Phone Booth' is truly unique in that the film unfolds nearly entirely in or around a New York phone booth.

Mix this with a rather unconventional ending and fans of suspense (And Sutherland's psychotic voice!) will certainly not be disappointed.",Phone Booth

He is a publicist, isn't it your job to fabricate and lie?) (2. So he fantasized about being intimate with another woman, we all do, as long as he did not act on it there is no problem).Kiefer Sutherland definitely made this movie, his voice is truly haunting. My problem with Collin Farrell is that he is an Irish man with a strong Irish accent.  I could not get over his accent in this movie, sounded like a cross between Antonio Banderas and a drunk Benicio Del Torro; Why not just use his regular voice?All in all, I would not recommend this movie, instead check out 'The Pianist' if you want to see a truly remarkable movie.",Phone Booth

Colin Farell does a great job at convincing the audience of his suffrage. And no matter how much of an A-S-S he was during the first 10 mins of the movie, by the end you can identify with him on many levels.

479,Pepstar,"""Hot Shot"" almost gets shot...",9,6 May 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** My personal rating to this movie: 9What an original movie this is! In the style of the famous TV series ""24"", we can also discover the influence of Kiefer Sutherland in this masterpiece.
The originality of this movie is the foundation of my high rating. For more than 90 % the movie is settled in a phone booth, but nevertheless this movie doesn't irritate at a single moment. That's a remarkable fact on itself.
The story of this movie can be told very shortly. Stu Shepherd (Colin Farell) is a so called hot shot, who's lying to everyone (his wife, his girlfriend, his ""colleague"" and lots of persons that hope to start a career as an actor) just to make a personal profit out of it. This doesn't stay unnoticed. When Stu picks up a ringing phone in a phone booth (""somehow you know it's your call"") he doesn't know that this will be the longest and most confrontating conversation he ever had by phone. The caller (the voice of Kiefer Sutherland, who has the perfect voice for this!!) makes him confess all his lies to anyone that is close to him by keeping a sniper rifle pointed at him. At first Stu doesn't believe the caller, but when a local pimp is shot down, just before his eyes, this suddenly changes. Stu becomes the main suspect for this murder, and in no time he is surrounded by policemen, interested people and TV stations. Almost every movement of him is now being watched by millions of people nationwide including the caller. The turning point in this fascinating movie is when Stu knows to open a second line with a mobile phone, not noticed by the caller. The police can know hear the input of Stu in the conversation that he must keep with the true murderer. They can now trace the call, and in the final scenes everything comes to a happy end, which is according to me the only unsatisfying point. The movie gave me the idea that this wouldn't have to end like this with a moral. The impact would have been even bigger when Joel Schumacher created another end.But everyone that likes original movies must go and see this movie. To me it was too long ago that we could see one.",Phone Booth
480,thetruth2oo4,One of the best in 2003,9,17 May 2003,"Phone Booth is one of the top movies of 2003, for the simple fact that it's an original. Every movie out there is about things blowing up and fighting (matrix an exception) drug dealing, but it's not everyday you see a movie like Phone Booth where the majority of the movie takes place in one spot but it does give you an outlook of how people are in this world. Farrell played an excellent role of Stu Shepard, who's a very egotistical, cold-hearted person who cares about him and him only and gets confronted by ""The Caller"" Sutherland, who's voice is so dangerous that I could not have picked anyone else for that part. Even though it's a short film (88 minutes) Phone Booth does stick out as one of the tops in 2003.",Phone Booth
481,Viljar_01,Tight,8,3 June 2003,"Phone Booth is a short and snappy movie. I assume you already have the plot outline available, so I'll cut right to the chase:Phone Booth relies almost entirely of the performance of the actors, and then particularly on those of Colin Farrell and Forest Whitaker. They do a very solid job here, the former especially so. There is a particularly crucial moment toward the end, a moment where you're likely to either stay in the movies grasp, and then walk away five minutes later feeling you got your money's worth, or fall out it, and end up with a faint nauseous sensation as you leave the theatre. Phone Booth kept me, barely, believing in the protagonist. But barely is enough, I was impressed by the end of it, and had gotten food for thought. That is more than I mostly get, so for anyone after a thrill and some reflection, I can safely recommend this movie.Viljar",Phone Booth

Funny thing is, even though it was short at 81 minutes, the movie just seemed to drag on forever.Why did this guy pick on ""Stu""?  Because he isn't truthful?

In my opinion, and you know what they say about opinions, this movie was a rip off.  It marketed Colin Farrell as some type of action figure, a role he plays well, but instead delivers a low budget, poorly written, well acted, piece of garbage obviously designed to lure in the public with sexy advertising and then give them nothing in return for their time and money.

489,kenneyja,Intense...inspiring...unbelievable.,10,30 April 2005,"I watched this film not knowing what to expect. What started out as movie watched on a whim turned out to be one of the most rewarding film experiences I can recall.Many viewers of this film would say that it's a great thriller. I agree, but I think it's more than just that. It's a story about reconciliation, realization, and change. It's a theatrical metaphor for the changes people go through in life.Colin Farrell plays the role of Stu Shepard, a cocky and rather dishonest Manhattan publicist who finds himself in the struggle of a lifetime. While making a routine phone call from one of the city's last remaining phone booths, Stu receives a phone call from a sniper who claims to have Stu in his crosshairs. The sniper has only one demand: for Stu to come clean about his corrupt way of life.What ensues is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that you won't forget. But it's not the thriller aspect of this film that you'll remember. It's the symbolism of the phone booth that will remain in your memory. The phone booth represents the time in one's life when a person has to choose to carry on the path of right or wrong. It symbolizes Stu's re-birth as a new man.I would recommend this film not just to those who are in the mood for a great thriller, but also to those who have experienced great change in their lives. This story fully encompasses the journey of human experience.Watch this movie with an open mind. Try to see the story from the allegorical point-of-view. You won't forget it.",Phone Booth
490,daryanparab,Takes you to the edge of your seat - and holds you there,9,29 March 2015,"Meet Stu, a publicist. He is full of himself, full of lies and good at talking. When he picks up a call at a phone booth, he ends up with a sniper laser on pointing on his chest. The man at the other end of the line clearly means business though we don't yet know what he wants. Most of the entire movie takes place around the phone booth. Yet, there is hardly a dull moment. The movie does exceedingly well at maintaining the tension throughout. It takes you to the edge of your seat - and holds you there. Kiefer Sutherland is the perfect choice for the man at the other end of the line. The role requires a powerful impact only with the voice, and Sutherland couldn't have done better. Colin Farrell does his part well, and we are convinced by the transition from insolence to helplessness and eventually desperation. Joel Schumacher has really risen well past his Batman movies and gives us a truly breathtaking thriller.",Phone Booth
491,atsharim,Overall average film,7,13 June 2016,"Overall I felt that Phone Booth left me wanting just a little bit more. The thing that really drives this film forward is its suspense. The constant suspense of wondering how the situation will play out. Collin Farrell gave a solid performance and was very believable. It must be hard acting on a phone when no one is on the other end.Every one in this film was solid except for the black guy with the weird eye, I could not stop watching his eye and destracted me the whole time. The twist ending was predictable and could be seen from a mile away. I only wish that the shooter had shot more people to keep the story more interesting.Also the hookers looked gross, could they not have got better looking chicks?",Phone Booth

But I'm no weapons expert, maybe that's possible, someone said something about that somewhere below.Also, doesn't the media have good enough microphones to listen to at least Stu's part of the conversation?Anyway, I loved the movie, plot weaknesses put aside. Great performances, lots of tension - my hands are still trembling. 'Nuff said.",Phone Booth

I thought at first that I would be disappointed and bored with the concept of a man stuck in a phone booth talking to a psycho. But with the cinematography, the details, and the great acting, it kept me in awe of the entire spectrum. This movie left you thinking about the little things you do and how you might consider it just part of life that everybody does, but how others see our actions differently than us. Keifer Sutherland is so talented to keep you so enthralled with his character when all you can experience is his voice. Collin Farrell did a great job with his character Stu there was so much emotion and passion in his performance. I truly recommend this movie to anyone who can sit down through five minutes of something without satirical comedy, something blowing up, or so much CGI that you wonder if they even use sets in Hollywood anymore. I think in a time when everything is shock value and special effects, Phone Booth was a breath of fresh air. It reminds us that there are some people out there who still act for a living, and they do it with such an air of dignity. I hope everyone takes 2 hours out of their busy, putting on heirs and keeping up with the Jonses life, to truly admire and respect what this movie does in its simplicity of telling the story.",Phone Booth
494,bartmancallum,A man gets trapped in a phone booth by a sniper and must do what he says,8,5 September 2014,This a very suspenseful movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat the movie has nice pace and seems very realistic this is because of multiple reasons such as the acting which is great the voice of the sniper is very chilling and the movie doesn't rely on jump scares like some movies do there aren't any plot holes ever and if there are well you would have to look pretty hard for them you can also relate to the victim because he's just a average man put into this situation and once you know the true reasons it kind of like saw there however there are some problems for example when he gets trapped in the booth three woman want to get in and are very annoying and demand to get in even getting one of there boy friends (a muscular man) to get him out with the unseen sniper killing him the girls then blame him for it even though he has no visible gun and being there the entire time so how could he have done it think but other than that the movie is still very solid,Phone Booth
495,williamdmoulton,One of my favourite movies to date.,9,26 April 2014,"Phone Booth is still one of my favourite films to date. The main reasons for this is due to how for the majority of the film being in single location. I am still yet to see a film that can keep me interested for the entirety of the film when the location remain constantly in a single location. The intensity of the situation ""Stu"" (Colin Farrell) is put in keeps me constantly on edge even after multiple viewings, especially with the Sniper ""Kiefer Sutherland"" as his voice is perfect for the job. Even now when I'm watching the TV Series ""24"" I still think of this film. Which I assume is the same reason that Metal Gear Solid V is using him as the voice of Solid Snake.Overall, this film (in my honest opinion) is one of the most unique films to date due to the single location aspect.",Phone Booth

Just like the movie mentioned, the phone booth was the last man used. After the movie was take more than ten years, the movie recorded some memories about what a phone booth looked like in an urban area in North America. Although I live in Toronto not New York, I know many movies were taken in Toronto instead of New York. However, I saw this movie again. I still think the movie told a very good story,although fake (I believe) but almost flawless. The story was described by thrilling way, and I cannot pause just wanted to know what would happen in the next minute. Therefore, 9 out of 10 is from mine.",Phone Booth
497,gskimu33,Give a second thought before answering that payphone,8,11 July 2005,"Collin Farrell an excellent star for the role of a cocky publicist gets greedy and has to have more then just a wife. This gets him into trouble when he has been followed day after day to make it to a payphone where he must call his ""side project."" We see his cocky attitude gets him into trouble in many ways. We get the feeling of this cocky attitude when we see him striding down the streets of New York City in the bright light, checking out every attractive female that walks by. Keifer Sutherland, another great actor plays the role of a sniper/enforcer. He has complete control in the film and has the power to do anything he wants from the birds eye view. Forest Whitaker, plays the role as the head cop in charge of the crime scene. His role is almost as this is normal for him and does this on a daily basis. He is trying to make the calls but due to the snipers power, we see Whitakers power accomplish nothing even though he is a NYPD officer. The city is full of people all over the streets and everything is going as normal, until it comes to a complete halt when we have the situation of Collin Farrell answering the phone. He is cocky on the phone and does not want to take any orders until it is proved that he is being watched and the sniper is not messing around. We get this as well when the hookers are heckling him for taking up the payphone as well. We don't really see Farrell's cockiness end until we see his wife show up along with the ""side project."" He now realizes that he has made a mistake and is looking out for the best of his wife so she too is not shot. This is a great film full of action and suspense even up to the last minute when we see Farrell in the back of the ambulance. His cockiness is injured and has almost cost him his life. He realizes this and maybe now will make some wiser decisions.",Phone Booth

499,uclamanboston,Not a bad movie...,6,10 September 2005,The movie could have been a lot better without all of the profanity. It was an extremely original and well-directed and written movie. But the profanity just got out of hand at times. I don't even hear prisoners talk like that and I do chaplain work at the prisons.Forest and Colin were amazing in this film and the director's commentary was very good by Joel. Great cinematography as well. The film was shot in 10 days and really should give encouragement to so many struggling filmmakers to do the same.The script is the key to a great movie.You should also check out 'Breakfast Club' as this was also filmed on one location.This would have easily been a '10' except for the enormous foul language that brought it down to a '6' in my humble opinion.,Phone Booth
500,lobich,Ugh... can I have my time back please?,1,10 January 2006,"This waste of celluloid... this thing called a film... this C- TV movie of the week seems to have been written and directed by the bottom of the barrel film school wanna-be's.Having to watch Colin ""what's his name"" on the phone for 80 minutes was, as others noted, gut wrenching. But gut wrenching as in if you were lactose intolerant but just had a big, cold glass of milk. This has to be his best comedy ever.I have to admit, I found myself hoping that Keifer's character would just shoot everyone on that street and put the audience of it's misery. The most memorable character was the cop that shot Colin ""what's his name"" in the gut with the beanbag. He was cool! Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest watching this movie unless you care to learn not how to shoot a movie. And oh yeah, don't even get me started on the narrator that seemed to have disappeared by the end of the film.If you really want a good crime drama, follow the producers of this film... they took the studios for quite a chunk of change.",Phone Booth
501,Knightchild,Great movie,10,21 September 2006,"A thriller with great suspense. The whole movie will keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire 81 minutes. You feel the roller-coaster emotions of the character. The film incorporates all the qualities such as suspense, thriller, comedy, sadness and any other emotion you can think of. The film does not drag at all and is very to the point and easy to follow. Its a very straight forward plot and is entertainment at its best. One of the best movies i have seen. Mulitple activities take place outside the phone booth to keep the storyline going. There is great range to the film and the director did a fantastic job with it in the end. You start with hating the main character and at the end you really feel his emotions and really feel sympathy with him which each event that takes place and actually feel sorry for him. By the end, you feel drained and he actually feel what he has been though...which is very rear in todays movies. It has a great soundtrack to go with it and the music makes you feel the ambiance and seriousness of the scene.",Phone Booth
502,wsbi2002,A Film To Boot,1,25 December 2005,"By far among the worst and most forgettable film I've ever watched with a poorly written script and disappointing acting that even Colin Farell's rising star is not able to save. 15 minutes of the ""drama"" would've already been too much for any homo sapien...The plot is unbelievable, the story incoherent and there is absolutely no character development. Keifer Sutherland could have spared us the agony and shot Colin Farell 15 minutes into the movie.Wait... I take it back... this is not among the worst films I've ever watched. IT IS the worst. 1 outta 10 is already way too good a rating... nuff said...",Phone Booth
