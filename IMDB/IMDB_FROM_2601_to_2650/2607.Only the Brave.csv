0,TheLittleSongbird,Brave doesn't even describe it,10,11 November 2017,"With such a harrowing and inspiring real-life subject and a talented cast and crew, 'Only the Brave' had a lot going for it and the potential was enormous.Potential that was more than lived up to. No other film this year so far has affected me emotionally as much as 'Only the Brave', even 'God's Own Country'. 'Only the Brave' is to me one of the best films of 2017, one can argue thus far but the end of the year is near so will leave out the thus far, considering that 2017 has been a very inconsistent year for films this is saying a fair bit. Like what was said in my review for 'Paddington 2', another highlight film of the year, after seeing my fair share of overblown big-budget blockbusters with little soul, films that waste great premises and films that attempted laugh-a-minute laughs and doing it in a way that came at the expense of heart, 'Only the Brave' was a much needed refreshment. Having said that, it is also a wonderful film in its own right.'Only the Brave' is exceptionally made on a visual level. The cinematography in particular is done beautifully and the practical effects will leave one spellbound. The music drives the action well and fits the film's tone, while the direction has both a hard and sympathetic edge that allows the drama to have full impact while not going over the top either way of overblown or anaemic.The writing is intelligent and poignant, really making one think. The story is particularly good in 'Only the Brave'. It captures the full harrowing impact of this tragic event, without ever getting excessive and the action is certainly the opposite of trivialised. The final act is one of the most earth-shattering and emotionally devastating of any film in a long time to me, it really hit me hard. Underneath all the emotion however, it also pays tribute to these courageous individuals, doing it in a way that's honest and inspirational.Another truly impressive component is the acting. Josh Brolin and Jeff Bridges are especially perfectly cast, while the support from Miles Teller and Jennifer Connelly is similarly on point.In conclusion, a brilliant, incredibly powerful, moving and exceptionally made and acted film and one of the year's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Only the Brave
1,Leofwine_draca,Surprisingly weak,5,15 October 2018,"ONLY THE BRAVE is a true-life firefighting drama following a team as they strive to battle a massive, out-of-control wildfire in the Arizona brush. Truth be told, so-called 'worthy' dramas like this leave me cold a little; they always strive to include interesting, all-star casts but then waste them on the usual scenes of bonding and bravado. The characters here feel very ordinary, not really worthy of note, and actors like Josh Brolin and Jeff Bridges do their best but don't really add much life to them. The cinematography is okay; the film's realism is spoilt by the odd dodgy bit of CGI (that darned burning bear, for instance) but generally sound. The slow pace means that the running time gets filled up by the usual family melodrama and the like. However, things suddenly make sense at the end, where it becomes powerful and moving stuff; a pity it didn't have the same strong writing earlier on.",Only the Brave
2,SnoopyStyle,sincere and well made,7,4 March 2018,"In Prescott, Arizona, Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin) is frustrated that his firefighters are kept from the frontline as elite Hotshots dismiss them. He and his wife Amanda (Jennifer Connelly) have a volatile relationship and a horse ranch. Brendan ""Donut"" McDonough (Miles Teller) is a young recruit struggling to deal with impending parenthood. It treats the story with respect and the formulaic telling with competence. I'm less compelled by the individual relationships. I don't really care about the conflict in Marsh's marriage. Donut has some cute moments although the baby stuff is too cute by half. While there are some heartfelt scenes between the frat bravado, the firefighting is the epic heart of this movie. This would work better with them fighting the fire while flashbacks fill in the spaces in between. The structure of the film needs some more imagination. Overall, the subject matter is sincere and this is generally done well.",Only the Brave
3,Prismark10,Only the Brave,6,15 October 2020,"Based on a true story. Only the Brave adds a little Backdraft with a story that is a little cheesy at the beginning.Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin) and his crew are known as Deucers in the wildfire firefighting community in Arizona. When the heat is on the Hotshots are sent in who are experts at fighting these wildfires.Marsh wants his crews to be upgraded to Hotshots and they have to prove themselves by going to fight wildfires anywhere and at anytime. He is aided by his supervisor Duane Steinbrink (Jeff Bridges.)There is also another story involving a new recruit. A burnout, Brendan 'Donut' McDonough (Miles Teller) who has been to jail, does drugs, gets into fights and his girlfriend is pregnant.Donut has to learn to bond with his sceptical colleagues and then prove himself as a Hotshot.The story is very much by the playbook in the first half. The female characters are secondary. Jennifer Connelly and Andie MacDowell are wasted. The firefighters are stock characters and are very hard to tell apart. One new recruit along with Donut is played by an ex Eastenders actor who then disappears. Maybe he got a drumming gig.It does take a darker edged turn by the end. This reflects its true story origins. By this time it reminded me of the movie The Perfect Storm.Directed by Joseph Kosinski who made Tron: Legacy, I thought the CGI fire was a bit poor. I was surprised to discover how young the fire crew were, many of them were in their early 20s. Maybe this reflects why the characters were never fully developed.",Only the Brave
4,nogodnomasters,It's all fuel,7,29 January 2018,"The film is based on the true story of the Granite Mountain Hot Shots fire brigade. It starts with the group working on their certification. It concentrates on 3 characters. Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin), the leader of the group and his wife Amanda (Jennifer Connelly). The third person is Brendon McDonough (Miles Teller), the rookie with a child who wants to try the right path for a change. Yes, it is a story of heroes, and it was well cast and well acted. The family drama which occupied much of the film was for the most part boring, written as a Lifetime type script and inferior soundtrack for the faux drama. I guess there is only so many fires we can watch the men fight. There was disagreement as to how to fight the fires...these groups starts backfires, as it seems there is more art than science involved, even though they use charts and wind direction. We got to see airplanes mess up and drop their load on the backfires by mistake and misjudgements caused people to lose their homes. In spite of all the hero talk in the film, hot shots in general. were not presented in a good light. This is more of a tribute film, which should have been shorter.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Only the Brave

6,zardoz-13,"A First-Class, Forest Fire Film!!!",9,1 November 2017,"A top-notch, true-life, tale of tragedy, ""Only the Brave,"" starring Josh Brolin, Jeff Bridges, Miles Teller, Taylor Kitsch, and Jennifer Connelly, salutes an elite team of ill-fated firefighters immortalized as 'the Granite Mountain Hotshots' who died in the line of duty battling the disastrous 2013 Yarnell Hill blaze in Prescott, Arizona. ""TRON: Legacy"" director Joseph Kosinski with ""Black Hawk Down"" scenarist Ken Nolan and ""American Hustle"" scribe Eric Warren Singer have fashioned a first-rate, inspirational film about the lives of the nineteen men who died in the inferno as well as the sole survivor who miraculously escaped. Imagine watching a synthesis of a boot camp training movie and a contemporary western, and you'll have a good idea what happens in this memorable movie about a maverick team of underdogs. Ordinary, blue-collar, middle-class guys, who drove trucks, drank beer, danced with their wives and girlfriends at country hoedowns, and pranked on each other made up the Granite Mountain Hotshots. Initially, this struggling company of firefighters, who fought fire by starting other fires to avert bigger blazes, gained little recognition. Comparatively, these firefighters resemble the 'smoke jumpers' from epics like ""Red Skies of Montana"" (1952) and ""Firestorm"" (1998) who bail out of planes and parachute into the worse spots to set fires to stop fires. The gung-ho Granite Mountain firefighters found themselves pushed around like minor leaguers at every fight until they earned their certification to be 'hot shots.' This certification enabled them to advance from the rear echelons to the front ranks. The sacrifices that they made to attain 'hot shots' status is comparable to the rigorous regimens that U.S. Navy SEAL teams must master. At times, ""Only the Brave"" ladles out more than enough sentiment to elicit tears no matter how imperturbable you count yourself.""Only the Brave"" doesn't dwell on the tragic Yarnell Hill fire. Instead, the filmmakers save one of the deadliest conflagrations for the grand finale followed by a funeral. Meantime, they trace the origins of these heroic firefighters, introducing the main characters as go-getters, and they provide us with glimpses of the supporting characters, primarily the rank and file firefighters and their families. A sense of camaraderie unifies these stout lads as they vow to become 'hot shots' so they can play a greater role in vanquishing timber fires. Veteran firefighter Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin of ""Gangster Squad""), who started out as a Prescott, Arizona, fireman, lives and breathes to battle blazes. This bespectacled but brawny fellow with a macho handlebar mustache assembles the men and forges them into a well-oiled outfit, rather like a drill sergeant shapes raw recruits into disciplined soldiers. Former Prescott Fire Chief Duane Steinbrink (Jeff Bridges of ""True Grit"") serves as March's worldly-wise mentor who counsels him about how to achieve his dream. Steinbrink delivers the best line of dialogue when he warns the men after a few setbacks about 'sympathy.' ""You want sympathy, you can find sympathy in the dictionary somewhere between s#&t and syphilis."" Meantime, Marsh follows his instincts when he takes his men to wild land fires, and he talks to an approaching fire as he tries to guess what will happen next. Marsh can see beyond the obvious when sizing up applicants for his crew. When a former junkie, Brendan McDonough (Miles Teller of ""Whiplash""), approaches Marsh about joining his outfit, Marsh gambles on giving this loser a chance. Admittedly a sorry specimen of a man, McDonough wants to reform because his estranged girlfriend has given birth to his daughter. Initially, Nathalie (Natalie Hall of ""Pretty Little Liars"") wants nothing to do with him. Everybody in Marsh's company has nothing but contempt for McDonough, especially Christopher MacKenzie (Taylor Kitsch of ""Savages""), who loves to humiliate McDonough every chance that he gets. Ironically, MacKenzie and McDonough wind up becoming close friends. Shrewdly, Kosinski uses McDonough to acquaint us with the rank and file members. Later, McDonough and his girlfriend get married. Meanwhile, Marsh doesn't have it easy himself because his own wife Amanda (Jennifer Connelly of ""The Rocketeer"") have a marital squabble when she insists that they have a baby.Naturally, director Joseph Kosinski and scenarists Ken Nolan and Eric Warren Singer have taken liberties with their depiction of the Granite Mountain Hotshots to create emotion-laden, dramatic impact. Specifically, the real-life McDonough didn't tangle with a rattlesnake, but the cinematic incident cements hid friendship with MacKenzie. Sometimes, two characters must be compressed into one character. For example, Kosinski and company compressed Fire Chief Duane Steinbrink's character with former Deputy Chief Darrell Willis, too. The people who made ""Only the Brave"" didn't want to clutter up a story already crowded with too many characters, no matter how essential those individuals were. The point is to make a movie where audiences don't have to maintain a score card because too many characters are in it. At one point, the cinematic Eric Marsh chews out McDonough because the latter wants to settle down with his wife and work as a city firefighter. Marsh reprimands him for wanting to abandon the crew. According to a USA Today article, the Granite Mountain Hotshots experienced a lot of turnover. Rather than shaming McDonough into sticking with the team, the real-life Marsh supported his decision to leave. Nevertheless, despite these discrepancies, ""Only the Brave"" is still a genuinely enthralling actioneer, with sterling performances. Josh Brolin is appropriately cast as the sturdy leader of the gang, with Miles Teller, Taylor Kitsch, and James Badge Dale standing out as Brolin's men. Jeff Bridges steals more than one scene with his quirky personality, and he appears on stage in concert during one scene strumming a guitar. Earlier, Bridges won his Best Actor Oscar for ""Crazy Heart"" where he portrayed a singer. Altogether, if you can tolerate some of its dramatic contrivances, ""Only the Brave"" emerges as a tribute to the courage and defiance of those 19 firefighters who looked death in the face.",Only the Brave
7,neil-476,I was not prepared for this,8,8 May 2018,"A group of Arizona-based wildfire firefighters have been working for 4 years to get from trainee to frontline ""hotshot"" status. Their superviser Eric is avoiding discussing the issue of children with wife Amanda. And new recruit (and ex-junkie) Brendan is doing his best to make the most of the chance he has been given as he strives to become the person his new daughter deserves.The trailer sells this as a well-made but fairly routine, and rather soapy, action/adventure and, as it gets under way, this is what is delivered to the audience. Anyone who has seen a few films acquires an unconscious appreciation of how films convey information, and this comes into play in a big way here: we are twice shown the drill whereby the guys climb into/under insulated bags to increase their chances of living through a sudden rush of conflagration - ""Aha!"" we say, ""we can expect them to be doing that at the climax, then!"" And, as our two main characters encounter significant personal issues towards the end, we say ""So X helps Y to get under his bag in time, but loses his own life - how pitifully we can see them try to manipulate our emotions!""Yes, we all understand the grammar of films.There are two groups of people - those who have seen this film or who have read something about it, and those who haven't. If you are one of the second group, then don't do any more reading about this film, just go and see it. If you are one of the first group, then you will know why I said that.This is a film worth seeing, and seeing it completely cold will make it a remarkable experience for you.",Only the Brave
8,HotToastyRag,Remarkable and moving,10,28 July 2019,"If you remember the forest fire in Prescott, Arizona in 2007, you won't be nearly as surprised by the film Only the Brave as those who don't. If you want to flow through the movie and experience the events as they unfold, don't read any plot synopses, because depending on which ones you read, the entire movie could be spoiled by the first sentence.Josh Brolin plays the head firefighter in charge of a hardworking group of young men who aren't certified Hot Shots, which means when there's a fire, they have to take the backseat to other firefighters. Early in the movie, Josh has a plan to curtail a fire so an entire town won't have to get evacuated, but since he's not certified, he has to obey someone else's orders. His plan would have saved people's homes, so he decides to get his group certified. Included in his group are James Badge Dale, Taylor Kitsch, Geoff Stults, and newcomer Miles Teller. Miles plays a former junkie trying to get his life on the right track after his ex-girlfriend has his baby, and even though he's far from ideal firefighter material, Josh gives him a chance.Most of the movie takes the audience through firefighter boot camp, educating them as to the details of the profession, the dangers, and the strategies of how to contain a raging fire. There is a fair amount of backstory for the main characters, and you'll get to see Josh Brolin and his wife Jennifer Connolly arguing about whether or not to have children, as well as the other men with their various love interests. Jeff Bridges plays Josh's close friend who isn't involved in the first-hand action but helps with the administrative red tape of the certification. If you blink, you'll miss seeing Andie MacDowell, who plays Jeff Bridges's wife, and Ben Hardy, one of Josh's firefighters, so keep your eyes open.Director Joseph Kosinski shows remarkable talent in only his third film, combining incredible special effects with immersive framing. This doesn't feel like a special effects extravaganza the way some comic book action flicks do, making the audience awestruck but not really invested. Instead, the audience is right in the center of the action. We feel the heat of the flames. We smell the smoke. This is an intense movie, and also very realistic. If you've never seen Josh Brolin in a movie before, you might think Hollywood found a fire chief who could act and stuck him in front of the camera. He's his usually subtle self, creating a character so believable, you'll think he can't be anyone else-until you see him in another movie and realize that yes, he can. Miles Teller also transforms into a completely different character. If you've only seen in That Awkward Moment and Two Night Stand, you'll think you misread the opening credits and that the blond dramatic actor in Only the Brave has to be someone else. Even if you've seen him in the same year's Thank You for Your Service, you'll see the necessary and distinct differences between the two characters. Where he was tough, he's now vulnerable. A confident, macho soldier with deep bonds of friendship is replaced by someone afraid, alone, lost, and constantly trying to do and be better.Get out a box of Kleenex for your movie night. This is not the type of movie you think it is. It was shamelessly ignored during the 2017 awards season, but the social climate of the year wasn't in the mood to honor this type of movie. It preferred indie, quirky flicks like Ladybird and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. After you watch Only the Brave, you'll realize how ridiculous those choices were.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to frightening situations and an upsetting scene with an animal, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Only the Brave
9,phd_travel,A riveting and different movie about real heroes,9,19 October 2017,With the recent fires in Napa & Sonoma this movie is even more involving and relevant. It's well made and filmed. And the story is firstly interesting then exciting and tragic. It doesn't feel like it is over 2 hours long.There have been many movies about fighting fires in buildings in cities but not many about tackling wildfires in the country side. What is different to see is they actually stop fires by controlled burning. and use portable bags as fire shelters. There is quite a lot of back story about some of the characters mainly Josh Brolin the head of the unit and his quest to get the team certified Hotshot. His lovely wife played by the mesmerizing Jennifer Connelly. Sometimes she is so slim on the horse she looks like she is in a photo shoot. Glad they gave her a large role. Miles Teller's character as a reformed drug addict also has a pretty wife played by Natalie Hall. Miles is quite different looking here and acts well. Taylor Kitsch is the comic relief. Could have done with a some more background about the others in the team though. There are a couple of small faults. The words on screen to show the locations was in small white letters and hard to discern. The dialog wasn't always easy to make out. Some of the accents were a bit thick. Jeff Bridges always had sketchy diction. There isn't too much lingering on the tragic deaths but would have been better with a bit more shown about how they got actually got trapped. The part about getting certified as hotshots could have been swapped for more of this.The reaction of loved ones is handled in a straightforward way.It's good to see a movie about heroes that are just pure heroes without any question mark of war or politics hanging over their actions. One of the better movies about firefighting.,Only the Brave
10,deloudelouvain,Maybe for fire geeks but to me it's not that great,6,22 July 2018,"The amount of reviewers that find this movie stunning, the best movie they saw this year, incredible etc..., that's just the stunning fact to me. I don't say Only The Brave is a bad movie, because it isn't, but making it the best thing you ever saw is a step too far for me. I can get that you want to honor the memory of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, and I'm sure they deserve every single attention for their bravery, but the movie itself is just a bit slow. It's fine to show the camaraderie they had, but not for almost the entire movie. A bit more action would have made this movie better. The cinematography of the landscapes made it for me worth watching. I never heared of this story, as I'm not an American, so to me it was a complete surprise. It's a tragedy, their bravery should be honored and they should never been forgotten, but that doesn't make it the best movie ever. Maybe for fire geeks, I know they exist, this one will be in their top ten.",Only the Brave
11,Hellmant,"A really passionate, emotionally charged tearjerker!",9,27 October 2017,"'ONLY THE BRAVE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) An action drama biopic based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots; an elite team of firefighters that fought to control the Yarnell Hill Fire, in June of 2013 (the film is dedicated to their memory). It was directed by Joseph Kosinski (who also helmed 'TRON: LEGACY' and 'OBLIVION'), and it was written by Ken Nolan and Eric Warren Singer. The script is based on the GQ article 'No Exit', by Sean Flynn. The movie stars Josh Brolin, Miles Teller, Taylor Kitsch, James Badge Dale, Jennifer Connelly, Jeff Bridges and Andie MacDowell. It's received mostly rave reviews from critics, but it's also disappointed at the Box Office so far. I really enjoyed it.The film tells the story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a team of firefighters granted the status of 'Hotshots', who heroically fought the Yarnell Hill Fire, in June of 2013. It focuses on Eric Marsh (Brolin), the leader of the team, and Brendan McDonough (Teller), a young father looking to get a new start on life. Each firefighter deals with his own personal issues, while also risking their lives to protect their surrounding communities. The movie is dedicated to the real heroes that inspired this film too.The movie is a really passionate, emotionally charged tearjerker (I think almost anyone could cry watching the climax of this film). It's also a really well acted and directed character study too, and at times it's pretty suspenseful also. The movie is just a totally involving look into a firefighter's life (it's a superior film to 'BACKDRAFT' in my opinion too), and really who's more admirable than a firefighter! There's no politics or prejudices involved, they just do what they do to protect others. It's just a really well made and inspirational film, that almost everyone should see (in my opinion).Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/eoAny_TuUM4",Only the Brave
12,FeastMode,my notes,2,24 July 2019,This movie is garbage. the good reviews can only be explained by the sympathy to the real life story. but this movie is really boring and poorly made. lots of cheesy moments. most of the comedy didn't work. the relationship drama was really annoying and did not add to the story at all. i was not attached to the characters.

13,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Sets its sights high, but emerges as little more than a leaden movie of the week",4,2 October 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe true story of Miles Teller (Brendan McDonaugh), a young man in a small town who's coasting off the rails. Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin), the head of the local department responsible for putting out forest fires, takes him under his wing, and trains him up with a group of other recruits to become a member of the specialist team. Against all odds, Miles overcomes all the obstacles thrown his way, until fate lands him as the only survivor of a deadly blaze.There are many sunny, palm tree placated spots in the United States that would seem ideal places to live, or retire to, if you had the right money, but many would probably do so without considering the wiles of nature. For all the sun, sea and sand somewhere like California has, it is beset by earthquakes, but also, with a dense forested area, forest fires. Even in England, this phenomenon has made headline news recently, with the outbreaks on Saddleworth Moor, which just goes to show what a big issue it is, and yet not much has been done to highlight this life. Joseph Kosinski's Only the Brave certainly sets its sights high, but is just dreadfully over-ambitious, and far from the sum of its parts.It seems marketed more as a rescue adventure type thing, but early on reveals itself to be a reality based drama, and saddles us in for the long haul. Despite strong performances from the lead cast, it just goes through the motions, trotting out the clichés as it goes along in a movie of the week fashion. At 124 minutes, this is a lot to bear, and the whole thing is somewhat overlong. Kosinski seems focused on drawing everything out, giving us slow, lingering examinations of these people in an effort to get under their skin, but failing to really make them more than cliched caricatures.It's only at the end I found out that it was based on a true story, and the film does deliver an unexpected emotional wallop that does lift everything that's been established before it up a notch. But still, on the whole, it's one that Only those Brave enough with their time to tread old ground will step up to. **",Only the Brave
14,ThomasDrufke,A Team for the Ages,9,22 October 2017,"There have only been a few movies in which the theater I was in went completely silent as the credits rolled. Only the Brave tells the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots who risked their lives to stop wildfires across the country. It's films like this that always move me the most. A group of people who you grow fond of during the course of a film band together in the most dangerous of circumstances for a common cause. When done right, they can be extremely powerful.Directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Josh Brolin, Miles Teller, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Connelly, and Taylor Kitsch among others; all of them do a great job of creating a chemistry and realness between each other. In order to feel anything when these men are entering the flames, there has to be real friendships and relationships built between the actors as these real life heroes. Perhaps more than anything else, Only the Brave completely nailed the bond between the team of hotshots.Going along with the bonds they have with each other, the film focuses heavily on a few of the men's personal lives, which is where the real emotion lied for me. Jennifer Connelly had the biggest supporting role, as the wife of Brolin's character, but that was far from the only character's personal life I felt attached to. As much as this a tribute to the men on the team, it's also a great film to honor those lives who were affected by the team in any way shape or form.Kosinski's directing, the team of writers, the ensemble of actors and actresses, and of course everyone else doing the dirty work should be commended for the work here. Only the Brave is a deeply moving film that never takes advantage of the fiery source material to bombastic results, instead only using it to honor the lives impacted. Truly one of the best films of the year.9.4/10",Only the Brave
15,cricketbat,A touching tribute to these real-life heroes,6,28 December 2018,"Only the Brave is fairly predictable most of the time. Even with the impressive cast, you can guess how the characters are going to act and where the story is going to go. However, the finale packs quite an emotional wallop that I didn't see coming, and the visual effects make it look like the actors really are in the middle of a wild fire.

16,851222,Great movie,10,26 April 2018,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Only the Brave"" (2017) is a heartbreaking and amazing achievement. As the one who just kinda heard a bit about this true event and watched this movie open minded i can safely say - this is a great movie.Performances were great by simply everyone involved. Directing and script were first rate. But the most important thing is here the true story about these men - heroes. When you see a poster of this movie telling ""Experience it in IMAX"" you kinda shake your head in disbelieve - sure the movie looks amazing, but when you talking about true story and its devastating outcome, its just not a thing you can mess around.Overall, ""Only the Brave"" is a great movie about great heroes.

17,paulclaassen,"Yawn, is it over yet?",2,16 June 2018,"This was my most anticipated film of 2017, and also the biggest disappointment. The film has your typical American stereotyped characters with typical American stereotyped back stories. I also found the character introductions typical American and dragged out. Couldn't they have skipped the petty crap and jumped right into the action? Uhmmm, then again, the film is almost entirely made up of petty crap and silly character confrontations. They are so annoyingly American. The film is also overlong for no reason. I found myself wanting to hit the forward button more often than not to try and move the film along. By the time the real action started, I've lost interest. The action also comes and goes in the blink of an eye. Also - and here's a spoiler alert - the firefighters move toward the flames, but when they get too close, they lie flat on the ground under their 'fireproof' blankets. The result is them burning to death. Uhm, duhhh!!! What did they expect? Lie there and wait for the flames to subside? How did they think they would survive by just lying there??? This was a big yawner.",Only the Brave
18,Thanos_Alfie,Bravery...,8,6 March 2020,"""Only the Brave"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow a group of firefighters and their lives from the start of their group until the time they became an elite firefighters group with the name of the Granite Mountain Hotshots. We also watch them fight and risk everything to protect a town from a wildfire.I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations or hopes from this movie since I didn't know the story behind it but after watching it I have to say that I will remember this movie for a long time. It's an amazing movie which is based on real events and has many action scenes that make you understand how difficult is the job of a firefighter and what these men or women face when they are in front of a wildfire. The direction which was made by Joseph Kosinski was exceptional and I liked the way he presented our characters and built the connection between the audience with them. I also found very interesting the way he showed us what a firefighter face when he is in a wildfire, their training and the difficulties in their lives outside the work. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that the interpretations of Josh Brolin who played as Eric Marsh, Miles Teller who played as Brendan McDonough, Jennifer Connelly who played as Amanda Marsh and Taylor Kitsch who played as Christopher MacKenzie were simply excellent.Finally, I have to say that ""Only the Brave"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. This movie is a life lesson for everyone and I believe that every person has to watch it in order not only to learn more about firefighters and their work but also to understand the difficulties of their everyday lives and what they risk.",Only the Brave
19,cruise01,An intense emotional roller coaster film about the firefighters that battled the Yarnell Fire.,10,20 October 2017,"Only the Brave is a great emotionally driven drama film about the Granite Mountain Hotshots firefighting crew that battled the Yarnell Hill fire. Well, the film is great. Director Joseph Kosinski did a great job in keeping up the pace from the intense fire battle sequences. Joseph Kosinski tackled the big budget visual effects flicks like Tron Legacy and Oblivion. Seeing him take on a smaller budget drama film was well handled. The film follows Eric (Josh Brolin) who is trying to get a crew of firefighters together. He convinces the town mayor to help get them evaluated. He recruits a young pothead Donut (Miles Teller), who gets high all day and finds out his ex girlfriend is pregnant. Then, there is Eric's former crew of Jesse (James Badge Dale) and Chris (Taylor Kitsch). Donut is trying to take responsibility and wants to better himself by supporting his girlfriend by giving her baby supplies with the money he makes. Meanwhile, Eric's wife Amanda (Jennifer Connelly) has been struggling with their marriage, as she wants a family. But Eric is too focused on his fire crew and away all the time battling fires. But the event that will test them is when a wildfire in Yarnell storms out of control. It is a great film. Yes, if you know the story you will know how it will end. But the build up with every character that are so distinct from each other. Seeing them bond and form a family friendship is what hits really hard with the film. You see rivals form a brotherhood friendship. Characters making a life changing decisions to better themselves. The character development is well done in the film. The plot is one of those inspirational stories of seeing these heroic firefighters crew battling through hell with these wildfires. They are like the brute force that goes in with only certain amount of gear with their chainsaws, digging tools, and their safety gear. It has a huge cast ensemble. I am sure, there are familiar faces with the fire crew and some that wont have enough screen time. Josh Brolin, Miles Teller, James Badge Dale, Taylor Kitsch, and Jennifer Connelly all did great. The director managed to keep the intensity on the fire sequences. When the climax arrives. The ending does become a little emotionally difficult to watch. But it does pay a great tribute to the hardworking firefighters that battled the Yarnell fire and all the firefighters around the world. Overall, Only the Brave is a great drama action film. The cast ensemble was great. The plot and characters were great and inspirational. It was never slow or boring. The direction was great as it captured the intensity of these fire crew battling with the wildfires.I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend seeing the film on the big screen.",Only the Brave
20,Floated2,Overlooked real events drama,7,17 August 2019,"Only the brave didn't do too well at the box office and didn't receive too much press for award season, so it turned out to be not much of a success in both categories. However as a film, this is quite quality and overlooked. Based a a true story, with intriguing characters and an intriguing plot, there is a real pull within its story.Josh Brolin is great as the lead in charge of the firefighter crew, though it is Miles Teller who shines in his role. These last few years, he has proved to show range in several different roles, yet he seems to be quite underrated in terms of the general perception.",Only the Brave
21,eddie_baggins,A powerful true-life drama,8,6 March 2018,"For a director whose debut was the visually fabulous Tron: Legacy and whose follow-up was the equally visually oriented Tom Cruise sci-fi Oblivion, Only the Brave is a surprising and effective change of pace for filmmaker Joseph Kosinski, who shows a side of himself we'd not yet seen and in doing so has crafted one of last year's most assured and polished true-life drama's.Telling the true story of American firefighters the Granite Mountain Hotshots and their ordeals they faced to become certified frontline warriors and their dealings battling some of America's hottest and deadliest fires, Brave is an effective and engaging cinematic firefighting experience that's arguably the greatest film yet made about the serviceman (sorry Backdraft).While visually as proficient as we'd expect from Kosinski, Brave shines most in its humanity and character portrayal's that combine to create one of 2017's most grounded and charismatic ensembles.Lead by Josh Brolin in the best turn his had in year's as fiercely determined leader Eric Marsh and backed up by refreshingly on point performances from young stars Miles Teller and Taylor Kitsch, Brave spends a solid amount of its runtime establishing the comraderie and relationships of this unit and while there are ample scenes involving the Granite Mountain crew in the heat of battle, Brave balances the small-scale with the grand-scale to great effect making our emotional connection to this story really kick-off.As the film draws on and the relationships between these group of friends/colleagues and their relationships with their spouses grows, Brave builds towards an emotionally charged and highly effective finale that makes the most of Kosinski's groundwork as well as giving its cast a chance to shine with supporting turns from Jennifer Connelly and Jeff Bridges becoming great supporting anchors for the film when the focus shifts away from the Granite Mountain crew.Final Say - Unfortunately overlooked by many last year, Kosinski's well-filmed and often powerful true-life drama is an engaging experience from start to finish and with a collection of noteworthy acting turns, Only the Brave becomes the quintessential feature film based around firefighting and a lovingly crafted tribute to a very special group of men.4 fire bears out of 5",Only the Brave

For petes sake it was released in IMAX. WHY? There is not a single shot worthy of blowing it up to a big screen. The first shot is of a wildfire. Wow, looks promising. But the second long scene unfortunately is about a firefighter packing his bag. For an entire minute, we see him packing his bag. I tell you this in detail, because this second BORING scene is exemplary for the rest of the movie, meaning: nothing much happens.Marketed as an action movie, BUT it is merely a relationship movie with lots and lots of talk. Jeewhiz, I aint interested in that.And when finally near the end, of the over 2 hour long movie, there is some real actual firefighting to be seen, the action is quite dull.Good acting performances from great actors, whom I all like in other pictures, but the general mood of this picture is a tedious, slowburning one. What a ridiculous title: Only the Brave. It should have been titled: ""Only the Sleepy ones"", because it works quite effectively as a sleeping pill.",Only the Brave
26,paul-allaer,Wild fire disaster movie packs an emotional wallop,8,21 October 2017,"""Only the Brave"" (2017 release; 133 min.) brings the story if the Granite Mountain Hot Shots fire squad. As the movie opens, ""Based on True Events"" we are reminded, we get to know Eric Marsh and his gang, as they are trying to get certified as Hot Shots, allowing them to combat wild fires in the front line. We also get to know Brendan, a doped-out loser whose girlfriend just got pregnant. Realizing he needs to turn his life around, Brendan applies to join the fire squad and for reasons unknown until much later in the movie, Eric decides to give Brendan a shot. In a parallel story, we also get to know Eric;s wife Amanda, a horse whisperer. But not all is well in their marriage... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from up-and-coming director Joseph Kosinski, who previously directed ""Ton: Legacy"" and ""Oblivion"". In his latest, he steers away from sci-fi and instead brings us the incredible story of the Prescott, AZ wild fire squad, nicknamed the Granite Mountain Hot Shots. I expected a disaster movie, and there is certainly that too, but the movie does much more than that: it brings the story of a group of people in a way that you are completely emotionally invested in those people, and you CARE. Kosinski directs an all-star cast, headed by Josh Brolin as Eric. Is it just me, but Brolin only seems to get better as he is getting older. That guy is just solid and authentic. Miles Teller plays the role of Brendan, an unlikable character at first. Jennifer Connelly is outstanding as Eric's wife Amanda. Taylor Kitsch is one of the guys in the fire squad. In much smaller roles, Jeff Bridges is Duane (Eric's superior), and the ageless Andie MacDowell plays Duane's wife. The movie's photography is eye-candy, and the wild fire scenes, which I imagine are mostly CGI, look very real to me. Last but not least, there is a very nice musical score, courtesy of composer Joseph Trapanese (who has worked with Kosinski before).""Only the Brave"" opened wide this weekend, and I was really looking forward to seeing it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended only so-so (less than half a fairly small theater), somewhat to my surprise, given the stellar critical acclaim this movie has been getting. I can only speak for myself, but I found this to be an outstanding wild fire disaster movie that packs an emotional wallop I didn't expect. I encourage you to check out ""Only the Brave"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Only the Brave
27,jtindahouse,"Safe, long and uninteresting",5,30 December 2018,"At the beginning of 'Only the Brave' we are told that the film is based on a true story. At about the 4/5 point of the movie I had to ask myself whether the true story was simply that fire fighters exist. The reason for this was that almost nothing happens for the first 2 hours of the film. It just plots along, slowly developing characters and skipping from one drama-less scene to the next. By the end of the film you find out why they were taking the time to make you care for these characters, but there certainly had to be more exciting ways to go about it.The film plays it very safe. There is no explicit language, very little in the way of violence and even the drug implications near the beginning are played very safely. At times 'Only the Brave' feels like a film designed for children to watch. I think that's why the 134 minute runtime drags so much. The filmmakers were afraid to be daring in any way and that often makes for a difficult film to watch.I didn't hate 'Only the Brave'. It's actually a very well made movie technically. I just know that films like this based around true events can be done so much better. Don't be fooled by the 7.7 rating on IMDb. There are much better films out there worthy of your time.",Only the Brave
28,stevendbeard,Heroic & Emotional True Story,7,21 October 2017,"I saw ""Only the Brave"", starring Josh Brolin-Everest, True Grit_2010; Jennifer Connelly-Noah, The Rocketeer; Jeff Bridges-Kingsman:The Golden Circle, True Grit_2010 and Miles Teller-War Dogs, Footloose_2011. This movie is based on a true story about 19 firefighters that lost their lives fighting a forest blaze in 2013. They were called the Granite Mountain Hot Shots-there were other Hot Shot teams across the country but they were the only certified Hot Shot team to work for a municipality. The fire was headed towards Yarnell, Arizona when the tragedy happened. Josh was the leader of the team and Jennifer plays his wife, who worries everyday that he goes to work. The team's personal lives are shown as a tight nit family-they would do anything for each other. Their main jobs were to go into blazing fires-when most people are running in the opposite direction-and save lives. Jeff is Josh's boss and Miles is the last recruit to join the team. Out of the 20 man team, only 1 survived. It is a heroic and emotional story. FYI: I do remember hearing some good music in the soundtrack; Metallica, Pearl Jam, ZZ Top and AC/DC-and they actually played my favorite AC/DC song-and Jeff Bridges even sings a song on stage, as his character. As the end credits role, pictures and names of the the actual Hot Shots are shown.

31,rannynm,Incredible Practical Effects and Character Development,10,30 October 2017,"The film takes time setting up each of the characters, making them feel very well developed. The use of practical effects makes the movie seem more real, because real fire is used instead of CGI for the fire. The characters also act like true heroes and seem very real.The storyline is about a group of firefighters who want to become 'hotshots,' which are the elite group of firefighters that work in the fire itself. When it comes time to assess them, their Chief doesn't agree with the assessor's opinion on not burning the wood and takes his own path which risks having their certification taken away. But the chief thinks it's better to do it that way so they burn the logs, making the correct choice in the situation and, as a result, they get their certification. After that, they go into many dangerous wildfires to protect nature and homes. One day when the Yarnell Mountain fire comes on June 30, 2013, they are especially challenged.Josh Brolin portrays Eric Marsh the fire chief. He has proved his skill in many movies including Thanos in Guardians of the Galaxy and as Beck Weathers in Everest. Miles Teller, the actor for Brendan Mcdonough, the protagonist, has been in Footloose and The Divergent series which were both huge hits.One interesting thing about this film is its timing. I live in Northern California where huge fires in the North Bay have left many people homeless and injured. Another interesting thing is that Only the Brave is one of the movies in the 21st century with the most practical effects.The message is to get awareness for the firefighter community, which it got 100% loud and clear. Kids will be influenced to save people's lives. There isn't much reckless behavior except when someone falls asleep while driving. I recommend this for ages 12 to 18 who will understand the shear force of the message of this film, although I think it was intended more for an adult audience. This movie is fantastic and I am happy to give it 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Abraham F., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",Only the Brave
32,moviexclusive,"Brimming with heart, spirit and emotion, this character-driven portrait of real-life bravery is a deeply moving tribute to its ordinary heroes",8,20 October 2017,"The elite group of firefighters known as the Granite Mountain Hotshots came into national prominence because all but one of them perished in the deadly Yarnell Hill Fire of June 2013, thus marking the highest death toll for US firefighters since 9/11. But this portrait of a fraternity of men who risk their lives day-in and day- out containing fast-spreading wildfires is much, much more than just that fateful incident alone. Oh no, as adapted for the screen from a harrowing GQ article by Ken Nolan ('Black Hawk Down') and Eric Warren Singer ('American Hustle'), it is a celebration of ordinary, sometimes- flawed men doing extraordinary things that pays homage to their indomitable courage and self-sacrifice, but never does turn reverent to the point of idolatry. These are men with real struggles and issues of their own, and in portraying these alongside their heroism, this well-rounded tribute becomes all the more compelling and poignant.When we first meet these firefighters, they are no more than a municipal squad doing Type II fire mitigation duty, viz. clearing brush and burning firelines relatively far from the danger itself. That diminished status is a sore point for their superintendent Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin), who implores the division chief and close confidant Duane Steinbrink (Jeff Bridges) to get them certified as 'hotshots'. That journey to cherished Type I status will see Eric recruit a bunch of newbies to augment their numbers, including the local screw-up Brendan McDonough (Miles Teller) looking for a chance to straighten his life out – not only will Eric have to ensure that Eric does not end up becoming their Achilles heel, he will also have to manage the dynamics between Brendan and fellow hot-blooded member Chris MacKenzie (Taylor Kitsch). Thus sets the stage for a good number of scenes which show how the men train – committing rules to memory, conducting deploy drills and creating control burns – which will pay off in unexpected ways in giving context of what the men will be doing in the heat of duty.That they will be recognised as top-tier firemen is no surprise, but it is how the relationships between these men evolve that is truly engaging to watch. There is plenty of camaraderie to go around, built up over months of training together and fighting fire alongside each other, such that Brendan and Chris will just overcome their initial enmity but become best buddies in a way that feels completely authentic. Due focus is also given to the families of these men, in particular Eric's fierce but loving relationship with his strong- willed wife Amanda (Jennifer Connelly) as well as Brendan's strained relationship with the girl whom he got pregnant and their baby daughter. In fact, the film is as much homage to the men as it is honouring their wives and children who endure long stretches of their absence and persistent anxiety over their safety and wellbeing. Deserving of special mention are the emotionally charged scenes between Eric and Amanda, which not only portray the complexities of being in a marriage with someone so consumed by a profession that may one day claim his very life, but also later on underline the unavoidably profound grief felt by his subsequent demise.Just as he does with the characters, director Joseph Kosinski keeps the firefighting footage real and authentic. Unlike other such genre films, there is no attempt to inflate or sensationalise the scale and intensity of these conflagrations; instead, each one is approached by the crew in an almost routine fashion – a call for help, a long ride out in their vehicles where they sing songs and trade jokes, and an equanimity on the ground borne out of skill, confidence and professionalism – much in the way that any one of us would our day- to-day work, with the notable distinction of course being how extremely dangerous each one of these missions is. Combining actual fire, special effects and CGI, the five different blazes we see on screen showcase the stunning and terrible beauty of fire, each one magnificently captured by Oscar-winning cinematographer Claudio Miranda.But more than the visual spectacle of the blazes is the brotherhood of the unit, the bonds between the men forged over sweat and soot. It is their camaraderie, their true-to-life challenges and their bravery, determination and perseverance that will stay with you long after the lights come on. Each one of the actors that make up the stellar acting ensemble portraying these real-life heroes puts in some of his or her best work we have seen, no more so than Brolin, who anchors the film as the strong-willed leader with dignity, gravitas and pathos. You'll already know right from the start that there is no happy ending for these men, not even the only one among them who survives out of pure luck and is therefore saddled with a profound sense of guilt, but their eventual fate still hits you like a blast. This is as befitting a homage as it gets to these ordinary men, deeply moving, immensely affecting and thoroughly realistic.",Only the Brave

36,Troy_Campbell,"Honourable tribute, but unmemorable film.",6,2 December 2017,"Ostensibly to fire-fighting what Deepwater Horizon is to deep sea oil rigging, this ode to the heroic Granite Mountain Hotshots lightens the action load in favour of no-frills drama that simmers in the salt-of-the-earth Arizonian lifestyle. It's a bold move by director Joseph Kosinski, one that doesn't always pay off. For every scene that effectively portrays the dedication these men (and their families) had to one another, there's another scene in which the sentimentality skyrockets to unpalatable levels. A quiet moment at a work BBQ between lonesome rookie Donut (Miles Teller) and the popular Mac (Taylor Kitsch) highlights the sort of subtle, affecting film this can be; whilst an excruciatingly prolonged sequence with Jennifer Connelly tending to an injured horse demonstrates just how easily you can fall off that emotional tightrope. Although Kosinski admirably grounds the movie as a character study, he also fails to fully convey what this perilous occupation entails; a deeper exploration of the job's intricacies could have added a level of interest to match the heart. Considering they're real life people it's uncanny how these men fit into cinematic stereotypes—the grizzled vet, the joker, the playboy, the one who always reads his bible, etc—yet the talented ensemble cast adds profundity, not least Josh Brolin as team leader Eric Marsh. Brolin portrays Marsh like a near-mythical figure, an expert that not only understands the science behind wildfires, but senses the pulse of a fire as if they were linked by an unseen connection. It teeters on absurdity, but Brolin is good enough to keep it from tipping over. Visually stunning and wonderfully acted, but lacking the necessary control over the romanticism of its topic, Only the Brave is a honourable tribute but an unmemorable film.",Only the Brave

38,jon.h.ochiai,The Hero Legacy,8,22 October 2017,"""Only the Brave"" captures spectacular imagery of the grandeur of the mountain forests of Arizona, and the beauty and ferocious nature of fire. In its most personal Director Joseph Kosinski's ""Only the Brave"" does move us. Beautiful compassionate Jennifer Connely as Amanda, wife of Granite Mountain Hotshots supervisor Eric, played by solid Josh Brolin, consoles Miles Teller's Brendan, who breakdowns in tears. Her Amanda tells Brendan, ""Don't you dare"" think of your life as less than. In the midst of melodrama and raging flames, ""Only the Brave"" is about the legacy of Hero. This ultimately works and inspires.Ken Nolan and Eric Warren Singer wrote the screenplay based on the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots firefighters, who fought the historic forest fire in Arizona. Brolin's Eric is the leader of the tier 2 firefighters who become Hotshots and heroes. Brolin embodies the passion and nobility for what he does as a firefighter, protecting the community. As the movie opens that passion is the source of conflict of his marriage to Connely's Amanda, who raises horses on their ranch. Apparently Amanda sacrificed having a family to be with Eric. That secret is the melodrama that mostly lands as authentic. Brolin and Connely's poignant chemistry eases some of the predictable narrative. It's nice to see Jennifer Connely back in the movies. Teller's Brendan is the lost stoner, who discovers that he is going to be a father from his estranged girlfriend Natalie, smart sweet Natalie Johnson. This is Brendan's wake-up call that he has to make something of his life instead of smoking dope with his buddies. Brendan applies for a slot on Eric's crew. Eric immediately outs Brendan as drug addict, and offers him the challenge to make the team. Miles Teller has this gentle spirit that enrolls us in Brendan. His vulnerability is powerful. This is his chance for redemption in life. He turns his life around. In the heartwarming scene, grubby Brendan sheds tears as he holds his baby daughter Makayla in his arms. ""Only the Brave"" is at its best in the quiet moments. Eric and Brendan's relationship is the heart and soul of ""Only the Brave"". Through rigorous training and firefights Eric and his crew earn the Hotshots rating. But the work takes its toll on all, especially new Dad Brendan, who can't spend time with his baby daughter. Eric knows Brendan so very well, and his past. Eric eloquently tells him, ""I am you"" It's about love. Love breathes greatness in others. This is how heroes are born. ""Only the Brave"" inspires. Kosinski respectfully pays homage to the actual brave men of the Granite Mountain Hotshots. Heroes give their all and use their powers for good. The heroes' legacy expands in the telling of their stories. ""Only the Brave"" does this in great understatement and more.",Only the Brave
39,RforFilm,"Though it's not perfect, Only the Brave does manage to tell an interesting story about wildfire firefighters",7,24 October 2017,"For those that live in heavy forest or near one, how often are you worried that a wildfire could one day wipe it all out? The darker side of nature is found within the ashes of former trees and bushes that have been consumed by a fire. It's tragic too see a favorite landscape burned to a point that makes it fit in with a post-apocalyptic Mad Max world. Though some are man made, many wildfires seem to happen by forces of nature. In fact, before mankind, fire seemed to be the dominant land maker, shaping the world based on how much was burned. Now that everything is more occupied, it's up to us to keep it out.Any firefighter will tell you that it's not as easy as using a fire hose. A wildfire is unpredictable and could go from ten acres to a hundred thousand should wind pick up. Wildfires requires a strong defense to keep it boxed so that the offensive can charge at it easier. Sometimes it's doing seasonal burns to block future fires. Sometimes it's digging around areas that could slow down a fires progress. The true life story in Only the Brave centers around these firefighters that are in that battle with the elements. Eric Marsh (played by Josh Brolin) is the superior of a firefighting team that's in charge of dealing with a lot of the aftermath of wildfires, cleaning up after the first responders come in. He's trying his best to work with his boss Duane Steinbrink (played by Jeff Bridges) to get his crew promoted by the state while being a perfect husband to his wife, a horse trainer Amanda (played by Jennifer Connelly). The rest of the crew seems like most men's group, with a lot of joking around, but prepped for the job when another fire strikes.Young slacker Brendan McDonough (played by Miles Teller) has no ambition or plans for a future that is until he finds out that a girl he dated if five months pregnant with his child. This, along with his mother kicking him out, prompts him to apply for Eric's fire team for one of the open slots. Though he's not as fit as everyone, he's accepted into one of the open slots as he doesn't give up. Throughout the year of 2013, he becomes a vital part of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, but then a voice during the Yarnell Hill Fire. This you'll have to find out why. You may notice that firefighting movies are not made too often. This is because fire is hazardous to the actors and crew and takes a crew of skilled special effect artists to keep everyone safe. Only the Brave not only looks impressive, but I found myself getting into the story more then I realized. While it could have focused on the Yarnell fire, filmmaker Jospeh Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) clearly wanted his audience to get to know these guys. While I can't say it all worked, it certainly gave me a good idea.The winning actor here is Josh Brolin. In the day and age where most men still want to look like boys, Brolin has embraced time, and this role rewards that, but letting his look of ruggedness work in favor of a fire superintendent who has clearly been doing this for years. I'll say that Miles Teller was surprisingly sympathetic as the slacker who is trying to do better. I would have thought this story would have wanted to included a moment of him getting back into old habits, but this story understands we've seen that cliché several times.It could have been one of the best movies of the year had it knew how to focus on the rest of the fire crew. The movie does try that, but it already isn't easy considering there's about nineteen of them, so it's going to be difficult to tell who even which one is. Perhaps they could have landed on five other firefighters and make them interesting characters. Whenever it cuts away from Josh Brolin, Miles Teller or Jeff Bridges, everything just halts to a slow bore. That's when I'm actually hoping for another fire to start, to at least give these guys something to do. I'll give this seven signs into Yarnell, Arizona out of ten. Only the Brave is interesting, if not focused on some of the wrong things. I'm glad I saw this, though I'm not sure if this will have a lot of rewatch value. Go take a look and see what I mean.",Only the Brave

Although it may feel a little slow at times, here is why I believe this is a film that's pretty much for everyone. When you're trying to tell a possibly tragic story about people that may or may not have to give their lives in the wake of danger, it really does require some powerful and devoted performances in order to get the audience to emotionally respond to the events unfolding on-screen. From Josh Brolin to Miles Teller, to even Taylor Kitsch and Jennifer Connelly, I honestly thought this ensemble was one of the best of the entire year, with the standouts obviously being Brolin and Teller. Each and every one of the supporting roles gave their very best as well, making this a very believable and realistic team.The premise of this film is relatively simple. A crew of firefighters is out to become the next crew of ""Hot Shots,"" and they will do whatever it takes, which also entails hiring some fresh and willing talent. The film dives into their lives outside of work and really invests you in each one of their jobs. I was quite riveted throughout each one of the fires, and I loved how it didn't take it too seriously to the point of depression. With a nice blend of bickering and action, these characters were more fleshed out and likable than I was expecting them to be, which really added a level of intensity to the overall movie. It really is the fact that this film has a terrific cast that really makes you feel for them when the climax occurs in the third act. I was not familiar with the events that occurred in real life, so I wasn't sure what to expect from the finale of this film. Although I feel there are some abrupt aspects about it, I feel as though it was handled with care and respected the families involved in the actual events. The final act of this movie is surprising in multiple ways and it did have me shedding a few tears by the time the credits started to roll. In the end, Only the Brave is definitely a slow watch at times and its run time is slightly longer than the material needs it to be, but when it's slow it also takes its time to emotionally invest you in its characters, so it's sort of a catch-22. With terrific performances all around, direction that seems to be inspired, and sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat, this is a very well-made a memorable film that I can confidently say will be one of my favorites of this year. This movie is well-made in every regard and I highly recommend it to everyone.",Only the Brave

Without the opening 20 minutes not one word of English spoken by the central characters was distinguishable. It wasnt clear, other than the fire fighting what was actually going on. This could have been such a good film but the dialogue, even at a very high level of volume on our TV set made for cancelling our viewing. You may be able to sit through this. We decided the off switch was the better option, sad, given its based upon a true story......sorry folks, shocking dialogue which makes this suitable, in my view, only for an american audience that would be able to understand what is going on",Only the Brave

48,trinaboice,Serves up piping hot emotional tribute,9,3 November 2017,"Grade: A-In a Nutshell: Based on a true story and an article written in GQ Magazine, this is a timely film that spotlights true heroes who fight fires. More specifically, it honors the real men called the Granite Mountain Hotshots in Arizona. Uplifting theme: Brotherhood, unity, loyalty Courage Family Second chances and forgiveness ""Doing something that's never been done before takes time."" - Duane Steinbrink (Jeff Bridges)Things I liked: Wow, how did they film some of those scenes? The fire looks very real. Great job. You get to see pictures of the actual men who served in the Granite Mountain Hotshots team at the end of the movie.Jennifer Connelly makes a gorgeous cowgirl and gives the best stand- out performance in the movie. Her emotional range was stellar. She spent time with the real Amanda Marsh to prepare for her role in the film. Jeff Bridges sings in a band called ""Steinbrink and the Rusty Pistol"" in a bar scene!I thought it was interesting that the famous travel empire, Conde Nast, was involved with this film. You see some beautiful Arizona landscapes. In terms of emotion and exciting fire action, Only The Bravereminded me of the 1991 movie Backdraft, which I loved. Congrats to Miles Teller for having two movies in theaters at the same time! He's currently also starring in Thank You for Your Service I liked Dierks Bentley's featured song Hold The Light Things I didn't like: There are several other movies also titled ""Only the Brave"", but they are not related to this movie. Seems like they could have picked another title, right? There were some scenes that were annoyingly dark, as in, I couldn't see the expressions on people's faces when they were talking in a dark room. I'm sure it was an artistic choice, but it still bugged me. Sometimes you can't quite hear the dialogue, because there are so many other sounds going on. I like Jeff Bridges, but lately he only plays the same old character in all of his movies. This is the first time he and Josh Brolin have worked together in a film since True Grit, another fantastic movie where Jeff Bridges plays the same kind of character. Don't get me wrong...he does it very well! Lots of spitting. ha haTips for parents: Some profanity, trash talk, and 1 F-bomb. Someone gets a rattlesnake bite.

54,akcenat,"Pleasant surprise, far better than expected",8,17 August 2018,"In an era where the words ""based on a true story"" can give seasoned filmgoers a sinking feeling, however, this is a film where the complications and messiness of reality add genuine heft to the drama. Only the Brave is a slow build that follows a group of fire fighters in Arizona where the surrounding forests are susceptible to wildfires. Despite its inevitable conclusion, you will follow this story every step of the way and be crushed when the final scenes play out. It will held your attention and got you in the ""feels"" on more than one occasion. The movie has a superb ensemble cast of actors in pretty much all of the roles. Highly recommended.

55,stevenrotherforth,A movie that will leave you as a smouldering wreck,8,19 September 2018,"Only The BraveOnly The Brave is a stunning movie to look at. Cinematography and special effects are handled with expertise.
However there's much much more to Joseph Krosinski's film than startling visuals.
With a dynamic cast of some true Hollywood heavy hitters, Only The Brave is at its best when just simply telling its story. 
The entire cast pull together as a tight unit and deliver one of the most emotionally driven movies of recent memory.
Based on true events about the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a group of elite firefighters who risked their lives to protect a town from a historic wildfire.
This movie is about real heroes not the fictional superhero kind that lead star Josh Brolin has become accustomed to playing in 2018.
Brolins portrayal of Eric Marsh is both heroic and very human as he struggles with his marriage and the inner demons of his past.
Jennifer Connolly plays Brolins onscreen wife (Amanda Marsh) and also gives a strong performance.
Miles Teller is good here too. He's never really caught my attention before but with this performance his star quality is all too apparent.
There's also a great turn from Taylor Kitsch. Once a burning talent in Hollywood, he now seems condemned to supporting roles.
But with roles like this he should soon be back on the road to stardom.
It is the performances in this movie that allow the story to ignite as Director and cast handle each character development with mastery.
When events do build to a perilous climax, the audience is compelled to care for those on screen because time has been devoted to their growth.
Many a lesser movie would skip on this and by the time credits roll not a soul is left in the cinema seat.
This film however leaves you mourning the loss of its heroes in silence as end titles scroll by.As a technical piece of film making as aforementioned, Only The Brave looks amazing. CGI flames have never looked so authentic.
The sight of Arizona landscapes ablaze is a mesmerising spectacle and I can only assume that this movie would have looked grand on an IMAX screen.
Still this movie transfers on to all digital platforms with a crisp and blistering image quality. The 5.1 soundtrack is equally impressive.
A good use of rear surround speakers help transport the audience into the blazing wilderness and bass is handled tightly.
Only The Brave is a hugely enjoyable film that will grip you, set your pulse on fire and then leave you as a smouldering wreck by the time credits roll.",Only the Brave

Josh Brolin never disappointed me in anything I've watched, I knew this was going to be good with him as leading man.The type of movie you can watch over and over again, the type to make you feel something with the uproarious peformances that are shown, I honestly felt like I was there with how powerful and energetic these actos were. Miles Teller was a great addition to this movie I felt him and Brolin really worked well together.A true engaging movie, definately has spread awareness of the true story, not many may have known about this, its always good to show truth within cinema, an exact cinematic masterpiece.

58,kaptenvideo-89875,Only the Brave is amazing. Best that Hollywood has to offer.,9,31 January 2018,"The current wave of the movies based on recent historical events relevant to modern American continues. Many of them have been good, but ""Only the Brave"" feels clearly like the best one yet.It's about about the work and personal lifes of forest fire-fighting crew in Arizona, everyday heroes who do important work that most of us would consider too exhausting and inconvenient.""Only the Brave"" has been aimed for awards season, of course, but it is a quality movie in its own right. Literally everything in it is done extremely well. It has suspense, variety, a multifaceted approach to the lives of its main characters,In addition to some magnificent-looking great fires, it's a real actors' movie, which means that enjoying the performances is big part of the thrill.And the cast is exemplary: Josh Brolin, Miles Teller, Jeff Bridges, Taylor Kitsch, James Badge Tale, et al. As you can guess by the names, the acting is really solid all around.The best surprise was to see Teller in refreshingly different role, from low-life addict to responsible young man. I almost wished that he wouldn't change, the performance is that enjoyable.There's even room for small but well-written female character, and Jennifer Connelly attacks it with fire and conviction, so another Supporting Actress Oscar (or at least nomination) following ""A Beautiful Mind"" shouldn't be out of the question.What looks like decorative character on paper has been turned into a beautiful and strong person who feels very real and really stands out among all the goodness the movie has to offer already.Basically, ""Only the Brave"" is 133 minutes of competence porn, Real Men and some Real Women doing What's Necessary for the good of everybody.But it's done in a way that feels always real, gripping and emotionally relatable, so we can call it the best Hollywood has to offer.And there's not gonna be a dry eye in the house when this ordinary heroes epic reaches to its end. Go see it. It really is that good.",Only the Brave

60,ivanmessimilos,Amazing true story drama,8,3 December 2020,"I was expecting a film about people who put out fires, ie firefighters. How wrong I was. People are literally fighting big fires. They look death in the eye on every task, and the bond they create with each other is too strong. I didn't like the beginning of the film because it seemed quite strange and unusual to me, but later it made sense to me. An exceptional and strong cast so I'm actually weird that the film didn't get a better commercial. In my opinion, the film is very well made, although lately there are a good number of films on similar topics, I did not like them because they looked a lot like documentaries, unlike this, which is a real film drama. It follows a true story, and most of it revolves around two characters. The older is Eric Marsh played by Brolin, and Teller played by McDonough, both real characters. We have a well-built story around them where the people around them help. I experienced them as real characters with their problems in everyday situations. The supporting actors are also great and have helped a lot in the overall construction and the whole situation and drama. Marsh has no children because he decided so, but he has given himself over to his work and views his squad (literally) as a family. Connelly was great as his wife showing what kind of work he was doing and the subsequent conflict with her husband. McDonough is in an unenviable situation, his life is in disarray and ruin, and by coming to Marsh's squad he was given a second chance and seriously decided to take advantage of it. Taylor Kitsch plays McKenzie, an ordinary asshole you can find in almost any environment. He immediately takes McDonough to the top because he is new to the team, but he is by no means a one-dimensional character and that's why I liked him. By connecting a bit through work and privately, he has become a very good friend who will immediately jump in to help when needed. Later we have another confrontation, this time between the two main characters and here you can absolutely understand those sides, neither is wrong. I expected some things to happen in the end, but I didn't expect it to even hit me emotionally and do it twice in a short amount of time. For the first time, just one sentence (Nineteen confirmed.) And McDonough's emotional reaction, a combination of anger, sadness, and despair, were enough. The second time no dialogue was needed, and that is the moment when they find out that only one survived and when McDonough enters the hall where everyone has gathered and then they actually realize that their husbands, fathers, friends have definitely died. All of this would not have been possible if the characters had not been excellently presented and presented as true layered human beings. Brings that literally fight fires and thus save many other lives",Only the Brave
61,gregeichelberger,Granite Mountain Hotshots: Ultimate sacrifices honored,7,26 October 2017,"There has been a spate of films lately that chronicle disastrous events within recent memory (i.e. post 2010). Such movies include ""Patriot's Day,"" ""Deepwater Horizon,"" ""The 33,"" ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi"" and ""Lone Survivor,"" among others. In fact, ""Battle Of the Sexes,"" based on an exhibition tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973, seems almost prehistoric by comparison. And while this Joseph Kosinski (2015's ""Oblivion"")-directed vehicle is deliberately-paced and fairly formulaic, the script (by Ken ""Black Hawk Down"" Nolan and Eric Warren Singer, ""American Hustle"") is based on a book (""No Exit"") by Sean Flynn, and is nevertheless quite affecting and the story stays true to the events which led up to the fatal fire which took the lives of many of the Granite Mountain Hotshots (no real spoiler alerts needed, just Google it) in 2013. Of course, with all such large cast films, little character development is offered, except for the group's supervisor, Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin, ""Hail, Caesar!"")and outcast firefighter, Brendan McDonough (Miles Teller, ""Bleed For This""), as the fledgling Hot Shots struggle to be certified and therefore become a legitimate organization. This takes nothing away from the rest of the ensemble, but there is only room for so much narrative. A few other supporting characters appear, including the fire chief Duane Steinbrink (""Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"" Golden Globe winner for ""Crazy Heart"") and Marsh's spunky wife, Amanda (Jennifer Connelly, ""American Pastoral,"" GG winner for ""A Beautiful Mind""), but it's Brolin and — especially — Teller who steal the movie. McDonough, nicknamed ""Donut"" by the rest of the firefighters, is a drug addict, hustler and just plain loser who somehow impregnates a casual girlfriend, Natalie (Natalie Hall, ""Shades Of Blue"" TV series).Basically, he was just another Southern California skater kid who ran with the wrong crowd, skipped school and smoked marijuana. Not allowed to see the baby, he is (finally) determined to straighten his life out. Since he has some emergency medical (EMT) experience, he applies at the Prescott Wildland Firefighters to save his soul and himself. Seeing a possible soulmate, Marsh gives him a chance when no one else would. Of course, like any fish out of the water production (or any World War II picture from ""From Here To Eternity"" to ""Hacksaw Ridge""), Donut is hazed and harassed and almost drops out, but manages to stay the course while the gang awaits certification. After all of that, however, Donut got straight, got fit and after a rocky start with the crew, was fully accepted as a member of the team as they traveled from Colorado to Idaho fighting fires. In the wilderness and on the job, they pulled pranks and put on skits to entertain themselves. We the audience get to see a few of these scenes, but soon its the conflagrations that take center stage.Meanwhile, we're in Arizona where the average summer temperature seems to be in the high 100s and wildfires are breaking out all over. Here, the cinematography of Claudio Miranda (""Tomorrowland,"" ""Life Of Pi"") takes over, with wide screen shots of the blazes licking and scorching everything in sight as well as tight shots of sweat and soot- tracked faces. Not since Mikael Salomon lovingly photographed Ron Howard's ""Backdraft"" has there been a more respectful filming of fire throughout. The results are both beautiful and terrifying. After a year of working to improve their hot shot status, the Granite Mountain boys are called to struggle against the wind-driven Yarnell Hill Fire on June 28. A lightning storm ignited in the high desert northwest of Phoenix. Two days later, the brush fire that covered a few hundred acres exploded across 13 square miles and chaos ensued. The fire wasn't contained, radio problems hampered crew communications and the smoke was too thick to see clearly. The blaze the turned on the 19 men (Donut was ordered to be a lookout and barely escaped with his life) forcing them to duck and cover under supposedly safe thermo blankets, which offered no help in the end. McDonough's book, ""Lost Brothers,"" makes no new revelations about why his friends didn't make it out alive. Without passing judgment, he says they acted on the best information they had at the time. He doesn't know why the crew took the path that led them down from safety atop a blackened ridge and into a trap they would not walk away from at the front of the wind-swept inferno. The movie ends with a heart-tugging scene in which Donut arrives at a junior high school where families of the deceased are gathered. All they know is that one survived, but they did not know who. Donut's arrival confirmed the worst news possible. McDonough suffered a severe case of survivor's guilt, but now does what he can to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their fellow man. The men who died, included Marsh, 43, Andrew Ashcraft, 29; Robert Caldwell, 23; Travis Carter, 31; Dustin Deford, 24; Christopher MacKenzie, 30; Grant McKee, 21; Sean Misner, 26; Scott Norris, 28; Wade Parker, 22; John Percin, 24; Anthony Rose, 23; Jesse Steed, 36; Joe Thurston, 32; Travis Turbyfill, 27; William Warneke, 25; Clayton Whitted, 28; Kevin Woyjeck, 21; and Garret Zuppiger, 27. Kosinski then brings the waterworks flowing by showing pictures of the actual men who were lost in the tragedy next to the actors who played them. Those who do not feel the impact of this conclusion probably never had a soul in the first place. Bare bones direction and filmmaking, but a deeply emotional experience nonetheless.",Only the Brave

Their families pay for their sacrifices for the rest of their lives; a burden to bare that nobody wishes for.Josh Brolin does what I can only imagine is an incredible job at honouring Eric Marsh. He is brutally honest, but totally fair to his guys and expects their absolute best. In return he has their upmost respect and trust.Taylor Kitsch and Miles Teller also do a great job at showing the bond between members of a team where their lives literally depend on one another. Teller's journey from rock bottom loser to family provider is a fantastic story of redemption and is an emotional one all by itself.Joseph Kosinski has quickly become one of my favourite current directors. Everything he has done so far has been gold, and I very much look forward to all his future projects; cough 'Top Gun: Maverick' cough. He made the transition from science fiction to a realistic true story film seamlessly, and in my mind without flaw. It would also seem that actors enjoy being in his films as there are quite a few that end up being in multiple movies directed by him.I felt that that all who participated in this film completely nailed the overall feelings of the journey to becoming certified Hotshots, the strain on the families, and the stress of the job. This is a wonderful tribute to them specifically, but of course to all those in these jobs who put their lives in peril to keep cities, towns, homes, and families safe from dangerous wildfires. Also, an important reminder to be fire smart and not be a fire starter that leads to so much loss.",Only the Brave

If I use THE PERFECT STORM as the benchmark for a film of this nature , this fell short on too many levels . This is the type of film that should make you feel emotional and cry . The only characters and relationship that I felt any attachment were the Eminem looking chap and Jenifer Connolly . Jeff Bridges looked more like Beau Bridges ! Ultimately it spent too long getting to the finale - the build should have engaged you more , the final half hour was the strongest part of the film but it was an uphill struggle to get there But the good news is it has got the story out there and shows the debt of gratitude owed to those who put their lives on the line to protect others .

The fire scenes are well done, though there is no technical explanation of what they are doing, so it is hard to understand in a little how it works, but as this is about the people, not the fires, that doesn't detract too much from the film.

Follow-up reports indicate that the supervisor's decision to leave the safe area and try for the ranch was an unnecessary risk. It is hard to think about heroism when the needless and horrific deaths of these brave men were the result of the ego and bad judgement of the man who they trusted and who was supposed to take care of them. Rather than doing this, he sentenced them to death by being air-fried at a temperature of 2000º. The supervisor ignored the basic math in a misguided hail mary play.There's a reason why the authorities were reluctant to certify the crew beyond the rating of hand crew.

I know that there have been other movies based on firefighting stories, but none of them have tackled the issue of fighting and controlling a wildfire in the countryside. ""Only the Brave"" does that, which makes it so special and outstanding.Josh Brolin plays the role of the team leader of this brave group of firefighters. Mr Brolin has definitely given one of the finest, and perhaps one of the best performances of his career in this movie. Apart from him, there is the legendary Jeff Bridges (""The Dude"") to add to the star value of this flick. The rest of the star-cast have also given commendable performances.The director, Mr Kosinski , has done an excellent job to depict this true story of firefighters on screen.

The performances were excellent, and the cinematography was superb as well. Only the Brave is the kind of film that will please most people and tug at their heartstrings.Although the movie is based on a true event, I couldn't help but feel that the script's structure was a little clichéd or predictable. What happened is clear, but the film's portrayal of the events felt a little generic.However, that is the film's only major flaw, in my opinion.

75,Amthermandes,Ouch My Heart,9,21 October 2017,"Not everybody has heard the true story this movie is based on. I went into this movie only based on what I saw in the trailer. Since it's nonfiction, I knew it wouldn't be your typical cookie-cutter type narrative, but I still expected it, and was blown away by the tragic events, and the extraordinary way it was presented on screen.This is the story of a special group of trained firefighters in dealing specifically with forest/brush fires. Their primary goal is to save as much land and lives as possible, as well as homes, from massive fires. These men train for years and when they meet certain requirements, are given qualifications to be labeled as ""Hotshots,"" which seems to be the equivalent of an actuary obtaining their Fellowship, or a boy scout achieving his Eagle Scout, or a junior varsity becoming varsity (or a varsity obtaining their Letter). Hotshots also literally fight fire with fire, opposed to regular firefighters who fight fire with water. This is based on an actual crew, their lives and relationships with each other and their families, along with the work they bear, the hardships they endure, and the fires they face. The most efficient aspects of the film are the acting, storytelling, and cinematography. The movie focuses more on their lives and relationships than the actual firefighting, but it does contain a fair amount of action. Beautiful Arizona scenery surrounds the key players and their fellow crew members as they battle an only-slightly-predictable threat. Only cons I have are ones I had to nit-pick. The film in an effort to reach out to a wider audience, should have toned down the profanity, which is heavy even for a modern PG-13 movie. A few of the relationship dramas/arguments seemed contrived, and while they did a great job explaining the countermeasures they take to battle the fires, there still is some confusion to their methods, and it would have been nice to know some of the other members of crew better. Phenomenal film, however, and was a tremendous memorial to these men and women.This isn't just a story about specific men and women in history who made sacrifices to protect one state, this is about all emergency responders. Just like how most stories about the military focus on certain groups and individuals, but remains a tribute to ALL who make a living from defending other people's lives and liberties. God bless our emergency responders, as well as our military, police, city firefighters, paramedics, so forth.",Only the Brave
76,eparazak,A well-told movie about true events.,8,26 October 2017,"Only the Brave is a movie directed by Joseph Kosinski and stars Josh Brolin, Miles Teller and Jeff Bridges. The movie is essentially a biography about the the rise of the Granite Mountain Hotshots and how they come together to put their entire lives at risk to protect their town from a dangerous wildfire.This managed to be a very interesting movie that brings you in very quickly when the movie starts. It is very well acted from beginning to end with interesting characters and motives. It's interesting to see how the members of the Hotshots' lives have changed as the organization forms and grows big. The movie isn't fully character driven, fortunately. The movie does have a large focus on dealing with the area's large wildfires, which are also highly engaging. It's admittedly hard to critique the execution of certain scenes like the firefighting scenes in Only the Brave when it's based on true events. If I would like to point out an issue that I have with the movie, it's that I thought the story structure was a bit all over the place, but again, it's hard to properly critique a biography movie due to the fact that it is based on true events.8/10",Only the Brave

This is a biographical action drama film based on the GQ article ""No Exit"" by Sean Flynn. This is the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots who fought the Yarnell Hill Fire in June 2013. It is dedicated in their memory. It has a stellar cast, including Josh Brolin, Miles Teller, Jeff Bridges, Taylor Kitsch, Jennifer Connelly, and Ben Hardy. Despite performing poorly at the box office, it received generally favorable reviews from critics and high praise from audiences. It has received some award consideration for its special effects.

That having been said...Acting: A+ all around from the veterans to the newer faces. Brolin stands out.

Overall, the movie feels flat and the acting is quite weak. The characters are not developed naturally and their relationships and interactions feel faked and forced. There are opportunities and angles in the plot that could have been exploited and better executed on but those were missed.

That way it would have been an epic tale instead of a forested version of Top Gun. This follows the Top Gun Maverick wing man narrative to a tee. You almost expect Val Kilmerto pop out of nowhere. Once you're through with all of the myriad av plot cliches and youve digested all of the lame shirtless volleyball macho stuff you might end up enjoying 1 out of every 10 minutes of the .film.

A wall of flames is about to lick up their neighbors, so these trees pay the ultimate sacrifice.The men chisel and saw into the timber martyrs in hopes of establishing a unmovable Line. A miniature trench forms in the loose soil, and brush is doused with liquid fire. The wildfire has reached the checkered flag, and these men will have the best seats on the track.Superintendent Marsh has been chasing the flames since before his crew's existence. A man that has surrendered all ambitions of fatherhood, now the great father figure of a rowdy pack of men. His wife, Amanda, has signed a contract with him, and together they pursue their respective work with insatiable vigor.Marsh's ultimate goal is to become Hot Shot certified. His would be the first municipal crew to achieve this accreditation, and many risks have been made to open the door. His intuition trumps protocol, and his superiors stubbornly acknowledge his genius. Working the crew harder than any of his contemporaries, Marsh pushes expectations out of sight. Giving absurd opportunities to deadbeats and giant heads, his kindness almost levels out his brutality. A man without a family of his own has the lives of over a dozen families hovering above his hardhat.Jennifer just might be the only woman that could love Marsh the way he requires.

87,cschultz-2,A Fitting Tribute,8,22 October 2017,"A ""hotshot"" is a firefighter whose specialty is working the front lines of a forest fire. And the new motion picture ""Only the Brave"" is about the Granite Mountain Hotshots, an elite crew of forest firefighters from Prescott, Arizona who established a remarkable record of success in their specialty but collided with fate and tragedy during Arizona's Yarnell Hill Fire in June of 2013.Written by Ken Nolan and Eric Warren Singer and directed by Joseph Kosinski, ""Only the Brave"" is one biographical picture which doesn't gild the lily, or idealize the subject of the drama. The firefighters depicted in the movie are human, and have flaws and weaknesses: Three of the leading characters are recovering substance abusers, and some of the picture's best acting is screamed between actors Josh Brolin and Jennifer Connelly, playing the Hotshots' commanding officer and his spirited and independent wife.If you're unfamiliar with the story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, ""Only the Brave"" is a genuinely effective real-life adventure picture which does justice to not only that famed battalion but also to firefighters and emergency responders everywhere.

There's a lot of male bonding, hazing and the sort. But at the same time, it exists to connect you to these people.

With the help of a slight breeze, a tiny grass fire becomes an auncontainable monster in minutes. Fortunately for me I have great next door neighbor's. The husband and wife duo acted with valor and urgency in helping me save my house and most of my 5 acre place.

100,metztex,In a word: Powerful!,9,26 December 2017,"Spoilers are relatively minorThis is the first film I have seen in a very long time that is truly powerful in the story it is trying to tell. This story of the Prescott AZ, Granite Mountain Hotshots (a term used by the forest/wild fire community to distinguish the elite status of a crew) describes the rise of a group of men dedicated to protecting not only the town they are from but also anyone that is in the way of a forest/wild fire. This film nicely describes the humanity of the main characters, their struggles and loyalty to each other (which was earned!). Additionally, it also shows the struggles and unwavering support of the wives who lost them and the incredibly important role they played in their lives (just wish the film would have been more aggressive in showing their important role). The film does not go too much into the nuts and bolts of how forest/wild fires that are fought (this film does not need to), but focuses more on several of the members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, their struggles in life and how they met and overcame them. This film also seems to tread lightly with very little 'artistic license"" in the final tragic scene and tries to stick as close to what likely happened based on what was heard over the radio before the end (thankfully the director knew this and kept it to a minimum).If you like true stories of the human spirit, you will like this movie and should see it if you have not yet. If you don't like to see sad stories, then don't see this one. While there is plenty of comedy, this film will tear at your heart in the end! The theater was by far the most solemn and respectful when everyone left. I have not seen that from any theater crowed since I saw ""Saving Private Ryan."".",Only the Brave

This one tells the tale of the brave volunteer firefighters known as The Granite Mountain Hotshots, who risk their lives to protect their remote community. Josh Brolin (No Country For Old Men) stars are Fire Chief Eric Marsh, a grizzly old man who loves both his job and his men. Miles Teller (Whiplash) is the young new recruit who finds the support he needs in the tight fraternity of firemen. Jennifer Connelly plays Teller's wife, Amanda, who keeps the home fires burning while her husband is out putting fires out.Only the Brave does an excellent job of showing the danger that the volunteers have to endure and it also shows the bond between the tight group of men who put their lives on the line each day. The movie also goes out of its way to show the stress that the job puts on the men's home life. The movie is based on an actual incident where 19 firefighters lost their lives defending their small town against a wildfire. Director Joseph Kosinski, who's directed a couple of Tom Cruise's action films, puts you at ground zero of the raging wildfire and, using CGI effects, gives you the incredibly scary feeling that the men must have faced while running to the raging fire instead of away from it. That is an amazing feat of courage.The movie has many quotable lines. My favorite among them was, ""We don't see things as they are; we see things the way that WE are."" This movie is a fitting tribute to the brave men who died, from their perspective, doing what they were only thought was right, because it was their job.Only the Brave runs a little over 2 hours and it's rated PG-13.

Being from Nevada, I was familiar with the tragedy and I have visited Prescott several times, so I was eager to watch the movie. What I didn't expect was the fine acting in the film. Brolin really played his part well and the other characters are certainly those you will begin to care about and relate to. This movie was not about fighting fires it was about brotherhood and courage. I learned that confronting a fire is similar to being in a war zone and the comradery among the men just as strong. It's a seriously emotional experience, but worth every one of the 134 minutes. See it.",Only the Brave

124,sksaathi,"A movie for the braves, dedicated to the braves.",9,4 February 2018,"Every day firefighters risk their life to save others and so the braves of Granite Mountain hotshots did in 2013. Great movie is the movie that succeeds on every level possible, and this is one of them. I really loved the movie in every aspect.
Joseph Kosinski really made the movie so sentimental and made sure that the climax will make the heart of the viewers to melt. The cast of the movie Josh Brolin, Miles Teller and others did really well. The plot of the movie was already great and it just needed some polishing which was done by Joseph Kosinski really well. The movie is too addictive in it's own way that you don't wanna leave your screen for a minute or two, if you like biography kind of movies.
This is a must watch for viewers who are really into movies and are mad for great movies.",Only the Brave

In addition, the film manages to characterize nature as something fantastic (when the hotspots see the beauty that the nature transmits) but also shows the monster that it can be (when the fires spread, and destroy everything in its passage).
The photograph of the film deserves to be highlighted due to the good use they give of it, as well as serve as a demonstration of the situation in which the firemen meet.
And the end result is a GREAT TRIBUTE for those who lost their lives in the fire of 2013.",Only the Brave

138,The_Shawshank_Inception,"A perfectly told story, and an amazing achievement in Character and Emotion.",10,27 October 2017,"I didn't know that there was such a thing as a Hotshot before I watched this film. Taking a look at the premise of Only the Brave, I unfortunately knew how it was going to end. However, that did not hinder the quality of the film. I was blown away by Only the Brave, because it took a little known tragic event and made it one of the best character-driven and emotional films ever.The characters in this film are nothing short of perfect, and the casting was spot-on. Josh Brolin gave the best performance I've ever seen from him. Miles Teller, Taylor Kitsch, James Badge Dale and Jeff Bridges were also flawless, and completely dissolved in their characters. And Jennifer Connelly is back! Anyway, Back to the characters. All of them have qualities the audience can relate to. Any clichéd dialogue or events that occur are pure human moments, and don't feel out of place or too predictable. Brolin and Teller's characters have true arcs, and are fleshed out extremely well. My point is, you CARE about these characters and sitting in the theater, you feel like you are with them doing this incredibly dangerous yet heroic job that adds a whole other level to this story about them.As the film progresses, we start to see that Teller has his own subplot trying to connect with his new family. At first I was skeptical about this and wondered why this character was getting way more screen time than the other members of the crew, and why he had his own backstory. This works for the film all because of the resolution. I will explain this later.The visual storytelling in this movie was phenomenal, because we see how mighty and powerful these forest fires are, and truly realize how brave these men are, getting so close to the fire. Even though we do not individually know all 20 members of the crew, because that would obviously take too long to go into full detail on, we still connect with all members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots watching them work, interact, and celebrate. Two thirds into the movie, we are aware that they are all heroes, and therefore people we care about. The film realized this concept excellently, and added so much to the emotional side of the story. And oh boy, did I feel some emotions towards the end of this film.Watching the incredible visual effects, and listening to dialogue throughout the movie, I knew something bad was bound to happen. The Yarnell Hill Fire happened. 19 of 20 Granite Mountain Hotshots died. Deadliest wildfire since 1991. One single lightning strike caused all this havoc. It's cruel. Here's what this film presented:It's the night before the fire. Brolin is angry at Teller for wanting to leave the crew so he can feel safer and be closer to his family. Brolin goes home with his wife, they connect, and he realizes what a dick he was to Teller. Now we're in the Yarnell Hill Fire, and right before Brolin assigns Teller to lookout, he redeems their relationship and says he will support Teller's family in any way and respect whatever decision he makes. Thus, Brolin's arc is complete. Then over the next 15 minutes, some unfortunate events lead to a windy storm coming in, Teller barely being rescued, and the fire overruns and kills the other 19 members of the crew. Once Teller realizes this, he drops the phone, and you can feel the pain his character is experiencing at this moment. Fast forward to the scene of all the families of the Hotshots, knowing that only one of those families is going to be relieved when Teller walks through the door. At this point, I'm tearing up. After Teller reveals that he is alive, and he looks around the room, and he storms out, and Jennifer Connelly confronts him, I start tearing up again. We all deal with unjustified guilt in our lives, but I've never seen a scene in a film that dealt with that theme so brilliantly. I felt so emotional at that moment because I spent an entire film watching real people develop into uncompromising heroes. The sudden death of these men led to not only Teller's character feeling guilty, but us audience members as well. And in realizing that our guilt is completely unjustified, we feel an emotional connection with everyone still in the picture. We learn that only the bravest men can be Hotshots, and they are not afraid of any tragedies that may occur. And in this moment, we know that these men should deserve our fullest amount of respect, for they have saved countless lives and are the actual heroes we all dream of becoming.What made this heartbreaking ending scene work was that we were given an entire subplot devoted to Miles Teller's character. Since he is the only one of the crew who survived the event, this section of the film pays off. Based on his arc throughout the film, we know he will feel the guiltiest because his life leading up to this was probably very different than the other crew members. And having seen his journey unfold, we know he will feel the most guilt about the tragedy. Because of this, we can see all the families in one place and still feel the same emotions as if every Hotshot member's family life was fleshed out with their own subplot. We still connect with these other families we know nothing about. This is very hard to do, but the filmmakers knew exactly how to pull it off, and I must give it my highest praise for that.This film connected with me on a deeply emotional level, and I hope it does for many others as well. Everybody should see this film, it is one of the best of the year.10/10!",Only the Brave
139,caradryanmusic,Criminally overlooked movie in Europe,9,14 August 2018,"What an impressive movie. This is the best movie I've seen this year. Unfortunately it looks like I'm one of the few that saw it in theaters in Europe. The movie came in under the radar and no one I know has ever heard of it and that's a crime. It's one of the best drama's I've ever seen and one of the few movies that choked me up at the end. The acting is just top notch and you really get to love the team and their problems and friends and family, making the outcome of the movie a very bitter pill to swallow, especially when you know this really happened. In my opinion it's Josh Brolin and Miles Teller's best movie to date.",Only the Brave

144,e-jos,"Spectacular, tragic, boring",5,17 December 2020,"Let me be honest, so you can judge if you want to see this movie or not. Despite the spectacular and thrilling, but very tragic events of the last 30 minutes, the rest of the movie offers no more excitement than a bad soap. Of course this is done to get to know the people involved, but more than 1.5 hours spent on walking around, drinking beer, being tough and family problems is way too much. Of course I only reviewed the movie itself hereby and not the true sad story of these heroic firefighters.",Only the Brave
145,matthewwalker66,An Emotionally Charged Ride,9,11 February 2018,"Straight from the opening music, I knew this had a certain heroic feel to it and throughout the story, the Granite Mountain Hotshots are portrayed as exactly that. The structure always seems fairly basic for a movie based on a true story but it has an impressive dedication to promoting strength in heroics and community throughout. While it is about a large group of characters, the two main ones are the ones really to stand out, and it's thanks to great performances from the always reliable Josh Brolin and Miles Teller that the core of the movie really work. The characters are almost complete opposite, one being an experienced and the other being in need of guidance which allows both characters to grow throughout the story in what becomes a time of happiness for them. Every bit of the story is very well told with the combination of strong acting, outstanding cinematography, and most of all, squeezing every bit of emotion it can out of this movie. This movie is the saddest I've seen in a while and achieves something absolutely remarkable.",Only the Brave

153,janburn007,This film is so much better than I expected,8,3 December 2017,"I went to see this film, when I was at a bit of a loss for something else to do on a quiet Sunday afternoon. I had seen previews of this film when I had gone to see another film at the cinema a week or so earlier. I was fully expecting this film to be a fairly typical, run-of-the-mill ""disaster"" type of film & did not hold out high hopes for the quality of the film, nor did I know much about the actors in it.The previews I had seen seemed to indicate that it was based on a true story - but that did nothing to allay my pre-conceived notions as to what the film would be like. I also knew nothing about the ""true story"" on which the film was apparently based - so knew nothing of the story at all, & had not bothered to research it prior to seeing the film.I was quite surprised then, when the film turned out to be so much better than I had expected. It wasn't exactly a star-studded cast, but there were a few recognisable faces there - the likes of Miles Teller, Jeff Bridges, Andie McDowell, & I scarcely recognised Josh Brolin, whom I had not seen in a film for a long time. The actors all played their roles well, so that we got a real idea of what their characters were about.The film shows a group/squad of about 20 rural US fire-fighters going through their paces in training & real life scenarios, as they were trying to gain their accreditation as a ""hot shot"" group of fire-fighters. One of their training exercises involved the prompt deployment of their individual ""fire shelters"" (part of each fire-fighter's standard equipment) - specially designed shelters which one presumes were designed to shield them from the fire, as a last resort, if worst came to worst. I felt somewhat relieved knowing they were equipped with such special shelters for protection - because I was previously unaware of the existence of such shelters.However, over the years as we watched this particular group of rural US fire-fighters in action, through several different fires, fortunately they'd never had to use them. Because of this, I found the film's ending particularly sad - it was quite a tear-jerker - so I'd recommend taking some tissues with you if you go to see this film. You might also want to do some reading about the true story on which this film is based. I only did that after I actually saw the movie - but it does sound like the film follows the reality of what happened quite closely -which is rather unique in the world of film-making.I give this film an 8 out of 10 star rating.",Only the Brave
154,mankind-photo,If you're a very emotional person that doesn't question anything you see this is you.,4,4 November 2018,"What happened to these brave men is tragic and worthy of a documentary to tell their story, not a movie for entertainment.This film understandably portrays everyone in a positive light, their flaws are shown but in a very sympathetic way.There isn't much of a story arc, we're introduced to and shown glimpses of some of the Hot Shots so that we feel an attachment to them and then we are shown their tragic demise.The fact that something like these events actually happened gives the film some poignancy, however, trying to base a movie on a one-hit emotional response leaves you feeling like someone wasted over two hours of your time with a cheap attempt of to manipulate your feelings.Just watch Oblivion again, and hope that Top Gun 2 is given a better treatment.",Only the Brave

I expected a totally cheesy, forgettable movie but what I got was a superbly acted, emotionally engaging film that left me in tears in the end.

166,ebmocnip,Australia has the worst fires in the world but this true story...it broke me.,9,4 July 2020,"I've seen fires which would destroy other countries. Fires which would consume entire foreign countries and then some. I've lived with years of drought and bushfires which have devastated my state and my country. So many brave firies have laid down their lives over the years to protect homes and towns and people.
Watching this movie added a layer of personality to this narrative. A 'human' nature. The multiple stories of the friendships, the camaraderie between the members of the Granite Mountain crew gave this movie depth. The relationship of the elder statesmen and the hierarchy of the fire services rang true with most beaureucracies.
I admit....I wept for the last ten minutes of this film. It was impossible to stop. The firefront hitting those men was awful and caused me to hold my breath (aside from the sobbing) while watching 'Donut' hearing the radio calls. I knew the movie would show us the families. Those faces......The despair and anguish on every face was challenging to watch. I applaud every actor in this scene. The eyes told more than the cries and wails. The collapse of bodies showed the futility of hope.
I hope many more people watch this movie. I hope that Australians will watch this movie and understand the risk and commitment made by the volunteer fire service members in my country. Our bush firefighters are not paid. They leave jobs, families and risk everything to save homes, livestock and people.
I will watch this movie with my children so they understand the bravery of firefighters and the legacy of their dedication to keeping others safe.

I think this movie leaves a beautiful memory of some fun and amazing men. Very impactful. I've researched these men and hotshot teams since this movie. This movie made me want to learn more.
I also love the theme song 'Hold the light' by Dierks Bentley, so beautiful I play it over and over again.
This is one of my favourite movies that I watch often.",Only the Brave

I can't say enough good things about it. I loved the way the story was told, the writing, the cinematography, the score, the acting.. It is a good judge of a movie when it moves you in this way emotionally. My first thought after the movie was, I need to go see this Juniper(you'll know what that means after you see it)Joseph, I'm a 33 year old father and wanna be filmmaker at the peak of my wanna be, and you just made me wanna be a hot shot more than anything.Go see this movie tonight.",Only the Brave

The story closely follows Eric Marsh and Brendan McDonough in whom Eric sees a lot of himself.
I found the cast very interesting, although I had my doubts at the begging with the casting of Miles Teller , I think, he once again proved he is a very capable actor.
Also, I found cinematics, areal shots and cgi to be very well made , music was on spot as well as dialogs. Also, I'd like to point out I don't often write reviews and it's been a while since a movie made me shed a manly tear.Definitely worth watching, 10/10 from me; wish more movies with real life heroics where filmed.",Only the Brave

It has a fantastic character development, very deep and three-dimensional human story, all accompanied by great and thoughtful writing. You will not just be driven by the sheer excellence of a real and true story, but with the careful and amazing structure of said story, which deservedly belongs to the art of cinema.If there was a film when it's justified to say ""This story should be in a movie!"", this is the one. It lived to the hype of this catchphrase, because both the director and the screenwriters made the hell of a job to tell us the story we need to know, and which these brave men truly deserve.Without any doubt, one of the best movies that I've ever watched.",Only the Brave

Movie sets out a terrific work from Joseph Kosinski. The acting from each stars including Josh Brolin, Miles Teller, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Connelly have been phenomenal.

I didn't know it was based on a true story. Second, I thought it was well written. It has a deliberate slow build up and the pay off to me was well worth it. Third, I enjoyed watching the rapport grow and play out between the guys on the team and the goals they were working towards. Finally, the story telling of the last 30 minutes or so was eloquently done and made me cry so hard that I still feel that pain a year later. I thought it was excellent story telling and I'm glad I had the opportunity to watch this movie. I also like any movie with Josh Brolin, Jeff Bridges, and Jennifer Connelly, and I think they played their parts amazingly well.",Only the Brave

Even though the story is spanned a couple of years, yet it still stayed dynamic and doesn't felt staled. The movie also successful in creating a strong ending by building up emotional investment and raised stake for the final conflict.Unfortunately that the movie isn't without fault.

209,alexing,Incredible,10,4 August 2018,"""Only the Brave"" for lack of better words, hit like a kick to the groin. It was not a magnificent display of cinematic talent I admit, but I felt immensely invested in the characters I got to know over a very short course of time, the way I would usually feel invested in a good TV-Series protagonist after multiple seasons. I felt the acting was a big part of me becoming so close to them, and the story itself is even more powerful. As a non-American I have never heard of the incident and fate of the Granite Mountain Hotshots prior to watching the film, and therefore my reaction to the story unveiling and the bitter end were completely genuine and non-biased. The film does make use of some very popular and familiar clichés- the coming together of a team, the new guy getting a hard time, but I found them less off putting than I usually would. Joseph Kosinski managed to give me, the feeling of disorientation and complete panic through his directing and the cinematic direction he chose to take. As someone who has experienced similar event in life to those shown on the screen I have to admit it was extremely genuine, I felt the hair on the back on my neck stand and my palms getting sweaty on multiple occasion, I could almost feel the heat and breath in smoke, as ""Donut"" stumbled through the smoke looking for a break in the fire, a clear path to safety. It was my favorite scene in the movie and in many ways it summed up the power behind brotherhood, and was the second time in his life he was shown how a brother would never abandon him and will give him a chance at survival.This is the focal point of the film in my opinion: Brotherhood. Not sacrifice, not bravery, but the selflessness of a bond between brothers. The lucky ones among us get to experience it, as I did and I suspect that was the reason I felt I was on the receiving end of a bolt of lightning on a clear day as I watched the events unfolding on the screen. Death is but a single event in course of one's life, but a brotherhood lives forever. 
This film is a must.",Only the Brave

The cinematography of the mountain scenery and vistas is stunningly beautiful. I didn't know the story or anything at all about the film and saw it on a pre-view screening before general release in the UK. Josh Brolin had a stand out performance and was totally believable. The film was patiently put together to show the camaraderie and emotional struggles behind the heroics, but this dragged the film to a pedestrian pace when more action shots would have had more appeal.

I found the acting in Only The Brave to be superb in that it is often unnoticeable - it's as though you're watching real people live through their day to day lives. The story methodically engages you with the characters so that it does justice to the real-life heroes that are being portrayed. If you haven't watched this yet, do yourself a favor and go see it.

But don't expect to see much blaze in this film. Any action scenes are over quickly. It's predominantly a slow moving study of the characters, inspired by true life - however cringe worthy and macho / childish / country yokel like they were portrayed. And here lies the problem with fictionalising a hero story. The characters tend to either be put on a pedestal or not portrayed as well as they could be. I think what hit me so hard overall, is how they managed to turn what is really quite a compelling true story, into such a snore fest, for all but the last 20 minutes or so. Perhaps the source material would make for a more interesting hour long documentary instead. Particularly for those, like myself, for whom this story is completely unfamiliar.
