0,TheLittleSongbird,One of the finest anime films of all time,10,29 March 2012,"I very much enjoy and appreciate anime, and Ghost in the Shell is no exception. In fact Ghost in the Shell is not just one of the finest anime films not to have Studio Ghibli's name on it, but also ever. The animation is breathtaking to watch, ethereal, fluid and very detailed. The score is one of all-time favourites, I love music(especially film music, classical and opera) and from the enchanting melodies and vocals Ghost in the Shell is no exception, really drawing you in. The script is one that really makes you think, it's a very ambitious and thoughtful one with its scientific and philosophical elements. The story is unique and compelling right from the start to the end, the characters engage and the voice work(more in the subbed rather than dubbed version) is very dynamic. I can understand why some may be underwhelmed by the ending, first time I saw Ghost in the Shell I was, but now I don't have a problem with it, and even if I did it would not stop me from loving this film any less than I do. Overall, amazing, one of the best of its kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Ghost in the Shell
1,SnoopyStyle,looks cool,7,28 April 2016,"It's the near future. Major Motoko Kusanagi and Batou are cyborgs and part of Section 9 fighting futuristic cyber crimes. Their case leads to an unknown Puppetmaster. There is the mysterious Project 2501. Section 6 had created a body to trap the Puppetmaster ghost. In the end, the Puppetmaster's goal is procreation itself.The animation looks really cool. Its visual style is influential. The story is short but the cinematic world is a bit overwhelming. The short running time gives a functional first glimpse into this world and enough exposition to suggest a vast compelling future. Motoko is a great character. There are solid animated action. The final reveal and conclusion is thought provoking.",Ghost in the Shell
2,jboothmillard,Ghost in the Shell,7,8 April 2017,"I saw the trailer for the Scarlett Johansson live action movie, that looked like a Blade Runner style movie, it looked fantastic, and then I found out it was a remake, this is the original Japanese anime movie, based on the popular manga comics. Basically in the year 2029, in Japan, advancement in cybernetic technology have allowed the human body to be ""augmented"" or even completely replaced with cybernetic parts, a significant achievement is the cyberbrain, a mechanical casing for the human brain, with access to the Internet and other networks, the consciousness is referred to as a ""ghost"", and the body is referred to as the ""shell"". Major Motoko Kusanagi (Mimi Woods) is an assault- team leader for the Public Security Section 9 of ""New Port City"", she successful assassinates a diplomat of a foreign country, following a request from Chief Nakamura (Simon Prescott) of Section 6, to prevent programmer Daita from defecting. The Foreign Minister's interpreter is ghost-hacked, the perpetrator is believed to be the mysterious Puppet Master (Abe Lasser), Kusanagi's team trace telephone calls to investigate the virus, but they end capturing a garbage man and a thug who were ghost-hacked and have no clue about the Puppet Master. The investigation is at a dead end, but ""shell"" manufacturer Megatech Body, with suspected close ties to the government, is hacked, and a cybernetic body is assembled, the body escapes, but is hit by a truck. Section 9 examine the body, they find a human ""ghost"" inside its computer brain, it may be the Puppet Master himself, the body reactivates and requests political asylum, it argues what constitutes being human, then a camouflaged agent creates a diversion that allows the body, with Nakamura, to escape. Kusanagi's team suspected foul play, they prepare and immediately pursue the agent, ""Project 2501"", mentioned by the Puppet Master, is investigated by Section 6, a connection with Daita is found, Chief of Section 9, Daisuke Aramaki (William Frederick), concludes that Section 6 created the Puppet Master itself, and are trying desperately to reclaim the body. Kusanagi follows the vehicle carrying the body to an abandoned building, she is anxious to face the Puppet Master's ghost, she is nearly killed engaging with the walking tank protecting the body, her partner Batou (Richard Epcar) is in time to save her, and connect her brain to the Puppet Master's. The Puppet Master explains to Kusanagi that he was created by Section 6, wandered various networks, became sentient, and contemplated his existence, deciding the essence of humanity is reproduction and mortality, he wants to exist within a physical brain that will eventually die, he downloaded himself into a cybernetic body to escape Section 6's network. The Puppet Master sees that he and Kusangi have a lot in common, he believes she also questions her humanity, he proposes merging their ghosts, Kusanagi would gain all of his capabilities in return, she agrees. Snipers from Section 6 approach the building, intending to cover up Project 2501 by destroying the Puppet Master's and Kusanagi's brains, the shell of the Puppet Master is destroyed, but Kusanagi's head and her brain is saved in time being shielded by Batou, Section 9 closes in and the snipers retreat. ""Kusanagi"" wakes up in a new cyborg body in Batou's safe house, she tells him that the entity within her body is neither Kusanagi nor the Puppet Master, it is a combination of both, she promises Batou they will meet again, before leaving the house, and wondering where to go. Also starring Christopher Joyce as Togusa, Michael Sorich as Ishikawa and Bryan Cranston as Dr. Willis. The breakthrough movie based on manga was Akira, this follows with a an equally hypnotic experience, if you really concentrate, you can just about understand what is going on, the traditional hand-drawn animation is magnificent, especially surprising with the amount of nudity, gory violence and exciting action sequences, and accompanied by great music by Kenji Kawai, a most worthwhile animated science fiction. Very good!",Ghost in the Shell
3,Tweekums,Great science fiction that just happens to be animated,9,15 March 2009,"Set in a not to distant future Ghost in the Shell is an impressive science fiction film that just happens to be animated, so don't be put off if you think ""cartoons are for children"". The film contains plenty of action and a plot which is up there with films like The Matrix, in fact this film was a major inspiration for The Matrix.In this strange, almost dystopian, future some people have been augmented with cybernetic implants and other people are in fact fully cybernetic. One such person is Major Motoko Kusanagi, an officer working for Section Nine. They are a tasked with finding ""The Puppetmaster"" a mysterious computer hacker who has been hacking into people's implants to control them and even give them false memories.While on the case Motoko questions the nature of her existence; while she may be artificial she is has both self awareness and emotions and is thus to all intents and purposes alive.The animation is of a high standard and is filmed in a way that makes it feel more like a live action film, for example characters don't show exaggerated facial expressions like huge smiles that are impossibly large as one tends to get in animation. If fact the animation was such that I often forgot I was watching an animated film and enjoyed it as a great sci-fi thriller along the lines of Blade Runner or The Matrix. Some people might be put off by the nudity early on in the film although this is desexualised and is given some justification in the plot. If you like sci-fi I'd recommend giving this film a go even if you don't usually watch animated films.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",Ghost in the Shell
4,Quinoa1984,about as visually striking as futuristic/sci-fi anime can get; possibly Oshii's finest achievement,9,17 August 2006,"This has been counted by some as one of the best anime films, particularly out of the Manga group, of the 90s, and even by some die-hard cultists as one of the all-time great science fiction films. I might argue that not to be so; it's too short to really take its full-on effect, and at the moment my view on the film is slightly taken aback by having seen the dubbed version- about as talky, if not more so, than A Scanner Darkly and even more loaded with exposition. But nevertheless I do recognize for certain Ghost in a Shell's total strengths, which are combining the elements of traditional hand-drawn animation, computer effects, and some kind of extra futuristic element that perfectly corresponds with the story. All of the sights that go by in the city-scapes and big electronic machines and weaponry and so on and so forth are about as close to being the anime equivalent of Blade Runner. It's a triumph, in that sense, of production design and technical grandeur. Even the musical accompaniment, especially the fairly chilling opening theme, is quite keen. If sometimes the plot becomes convoluted, it's not too much to bear; as long as you pay attention- not like the sci-fi that might whiz past you in its dumbed state- it's not much of a stretch. It does leave off on a sort of open-ended note (see other running anime series and sequel for possible details), and one that puts a lot of philosophical contemplations to go alongside the techno-wizardry, violence, and cyborg-nudity. But as it stands, Ghost in the Shell is worth it to check out, even just regular casual observers of anime. It doesn't leave the immediate wallop of a classic like Fist of the North Star, but it also doesn't leave you disappointed either. It has me anticipating the original Japanese language version far greater now that I know the dubbed-version's limitations.",Ghost in the Shell

6,grantss,"Intriguing, action-filled animated sci fi drama",7,7 May 2017,"It is the year 2029. Technology has advanced so far that cyborgs are commonplace. In addition, human brains can direct to the internet directly. Major Motoko Kasunagi is an officer in Section 9, an elite, secretive police division that deals with special operations, including counter terrorism and cyber crime. She is currently on the trail of the Puppet Master, a cyber criminal who hacks into the brains of cyborgs in order to obtain information and to commit other crimes.Entertaining movie. Intriguing plot with decent development. Good action scenes and great CGI. Covers some interesting themes too, including the theme that always comes in cyborg/robot movies, sentience and what it means to be human.Not brilliant though. Many scenes feel like your average action- thriller at times, with the conventional car chases and the like. The whole sentience theme is nothing new (see Blade Runner, for example) and feels underdeveloped here.Moreover, the ending is quite open-ended and anticlimactic. I was hoping for something more profound, or, at least, conclusive.Good, but not great.",Ghost in the Shell
7,view_and_review,Cerebral and Action Packed,7,11 July 2021,"""Ghost in the Shell"" takes place in the future where just about everybody has been augmented in some fashion. Rare are the people who are 100% organic and tech free. Then you have those creations like Major Kusanagi Motoko who is an android with very little human tissue.In this metropolis with different sectors a person or thing called The Puppet Master is wreaking havoc. He is hacking people and robots and causing some serious problems. Major Kusanagi and her team are desperate to find out the true identity of The Puppet Master and put an end to his antics.The ""ghost"" referred to is synonymous to the soul in many ways. It's referred to obliquely and with an inference that it is similar to the soul or maybe consciousness. In any case, the movie frequently circles back to the meaning of being human and the differences, or lack thereof, between cybernetic beings and humans. It is some tasty food for thought and is more than just a mindless action movie with spectacular action sequences... although it has that too.",Ghost in the Shell
8,Mr-Fusion,Leaves its mark,6,6 August 2015,"There's some chilling stuff going on in ""Ghost in the Shell"" - dark themes, terrifying dystopia, even some imagery - but I confess I like this movie mostly for its visuals. Between the gun porn and all the cool tech these characters are playing with , there's plenty to lay eyes on. There are also naked chicks, but that actually falls into the creepy column in this case.On a story level, when you compare this to ""Blade Runner"" and ""Akira"" (it's a common comparison), ""Ghost""'s story is a bit clumsy. Not hard to follow, mind you, but it lacks the impact and whacked-out thrill of the others. For me, at least. But the animation is superb, the action (occasional though it may be)is riveting, and I still can't get the opening Japanese chorus out of my head. And who can forget that left hook of a final scene? 6/10 6/10",Ghost in the Shell
9,cherold,decent but overrated,6,5 June 2004,"I watched this before reading the IMDB reviews, so I had no idea it was considered some sort of classic, and never could have guessed that from the movie itself.  It's a watchable movie.  The animation is good, although I've had more moments of wonder and awe from the animation of a single episode of Cowboy Bebop than from this whole movie.  It does a good job of combining the three favorite components of anime: nudity, savage violence and contemplation on the nature of self.  The concepts feel a little underdeveloped, but you get the idea.  The story also feels a bit lacking.  The ending is especially weak, not for what happens but for the lack of preparation.  Motoko is a decent stock character but nothing more, and for the ending to resonate one needs a better sense of who she is.  The end result left me with a so-what feeling, and I give this 6/10.",Ghost in the Shell
10,ericstevenson,"Yeah, this version's better",10,14 May 2017,"I am glad to say that this was the best film I have seen for Anime Month so far! The best part is probably how gorgeous the animation is. Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anime that looked more realistic than this. They got the facial expressions and body movements about as authentic as you can get. The colors and everything else are so beautiful in this. I saw a dubbed version, but am glad the one I saw didn't omit any Japanese writing or anything. Yeah, it's not much, but I can always appreciate versions like that. This movie tells the story of a cyborg woman on a police force.I have always been fascinated by this film if only because on the surface, it seemed to be the most adult oriented animated film ever made. It's hard not to notice the sexual overtones. I mean, the main character is in a robot body resembling a naked woman! I guess there's no reason for this, but it creates perfect atmosphere. I saw the live-action version and I'll cut it some slack because it would be impossible to make any other version on the same level as this film. We get great dialogue all the time. The film is fairly short, but the pacing is simply fantastic.My favorite part is probably when she's trying to rip the top off of the tank, but her metal tendons actually burst through her skin and even off her body. It's so powerful to see the diligence in her. I love hearing the conversations about the idea of creating a soul and what it means to be truly human. It's pretty unique for the genre and it has a really nice unexpected ending too. It certainly felt epic even with its short running time. It's still based on a manga, but feels original. ****",Ghost in the Shell
11,Irishchatter,It's OK but you would immediately get lost in this...,3,29 November 2015,"I decided to watch this movie because it seemed to be the only anime film that I've never seen before so I decided to watch this for entertainment. I wouldn't call this the best movie I've seen, it's not that brilliant or good but rather, confusing and has alright action. I have to say, the action wasn't that bad, it's just the film itself didn't appeal to me. I haven't a clue who the characters were because the storyline seemed to be all over the place. I didn't understand why the woman didn't normally wear any clothes? Is this a sex or a nudist movie? It seemed to be like a pornography film, maybe?I just don't even know why they had to do remakes or sequels, you nearly have to understand what's going on, I just couldn't pick up on what they were saying!",Ghost in the Shell
12,CuriosityKilledShawn,Ghost of a story,5,21 January 2001,"I tried to get into GITS way back in 1999 and it just didn't wash with me. I thought it was because the material was perhaps above me and that this kind of sci-fi was outside of my comfort zone. Now, all this time later, I decided to revisit the movie hoping that my older, more refined judgement would let me see the movie in a different light. Nope. It's still as impenetrable as it always was.In light of more recent sci-fi such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Transcendence, and even RobocCop when you think about it (all of which have a strong thematic connection), GITS does have some relevance and an intriguing idea in a world that is evolving digitally far, far quicker than it is evolving socially or ethically. The story has so much to offer in that regard, it's ripe for satire, commentary, and allegory but nothing becomes of it. The credits roll at the 78 minute mark leaving you feeling that you've been short-changed. There is a lot of potential in the set-up but it's mostly squandered on techno-babble and overwrought, pompous dialogue that is rife with exposition.The movie was followed (and its universe expanded) by a sequel in 2004, an OVA, and a TV series, but this original venture feels more like a truncated TV pilot instead of a completely stand-alone movie. I am glad I gave the movie another go but the adoration mystifies me and the fans don't convince me.",Ghost in the Shell
13,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Cyber Punk,8,27 August 2021,"It was a very interesting anime. The subject is perfect. A real cyberpunk. The music is great.Watch it without hesitation, it will be one of the best anime you will ever watch.",Ghost in the Shell
14,tabuno,"Creative, but Not Spectacular Anymore",5,20 January 2019,"16 December 2008. Oddly enough, this movie may have been innovative and visually stunning, but its visceral, textual, and intellectual presentation have been badly dated resulting in a stunted experience. Robocop (1987) eight years earlier did a better job of the climatic fight/combat scene, while Aliens (1986) eleven years earlier presented a much more compelling action sequence and mechanical/combat machines. As for the animation, there is a disturbing discontinuity in overall photography that transforms and not smoothly between an almost exquisite animated moving drawing and a more bland, simple lifeless caricature. Final Fantasy (1991) four years earlier had produced the technical competence to realize what could be the best production/photographic technique to capture the essential premise of this movie - the fusion of man and computers, between the human brain and the electronic one, between human life and a new form of life. The dialogue was extended and lengthy, talking down to the audience that nowadays, such subject matter is almost taken for granted. The lack of the more controversial and interesting component of emotion was lacking in the animated voices, further disconnecting the audience's empathy - it sounded more like two talking robots attempting to talk existentialism. The music and the soundtrack were interesting efforts of creative explosions that didn't always work, especially with the tracking/following scene occurs with the musical flow not really effectively capturing the mood of the moment. This movie if it had been made in the 70s might have been a fabulous breakthrough, but by the time of its American release in 1995 it had already been superseded by other movies. Five years later The Cell (2000) would provide the amazing potential of the immersion of two minds while The Outer Limits, the television series (1995) would provide a superior look at the electronic mind and the number of more intimate issues without the exotic trappings of government conspiracies and military and technological gadgets and one episode in particular ""Caught in the Act"" its R-rated nudity scene as well as later was able to capture the emotional connection so much intensely. The most glaringly oversight, especially in the design department is the inability of the animation to really approach the layered look which in some instances appeared to be copied from Blade Runner (1982) that was shot more than a decade earlier. It is really Blade Runner that set the bar for set design that animated drawings could not approach.",Ghost in the Shell
15,The-Sarkologist,Exploring the nature of the human soul,8,16 February 2012,"This movie takes on some of the themes that Dark City explores, namely the nature of the soul (or ghost as this movie refers to it), the nature of who we are and sentience in general. Like Dark City, this movie deals with the ability to program human memories and thus change our identity. In this movie, the programming is done through computers by hacking into the person's brain and then rewriting the brainwave patterns. This movie also looks at technological advancement and questions its morality. Will we advance to a point where technology will become sentient and turn on us? Ghost in the shell is based around a group of officers belonging to an organisation known as section 9. These cops are heavily enhanced through cybernetics and deal with cyber-criminals. They are chasing a criminal known as the puppet master, who has done everything from terrorism to theft of information. He is a threat because he seeks to undermine international security. The puppet master is very dangerous because he hacks into people's souls (ghosts) and rewrites them and thus uses them to further his gaols. His goals are never really quite clear but this is not what Ghost in the Shell is looking for.The title of the movie suggests the theme of the movie. Can technology reach a point to where we can transfer our bodies and retain our soul? And is the soul something that can be programmed and manipulated? This movie seems to suggest that it is, and it is our soul that makes us human, everything else is simply a shell. We are focused on the cyborgs and they are contrasted with a police officer who has only a phone installed in his head. Yet we notice that the cyborgs are as human as the police officer. They still enjoy the pleasures of life and seek to experience more. The drawback is that their body is owned by the government and thus they have less freedom than those with a flesh body. Even so, they are still human.Sentience is another theme. It questions the structure of our soul and raises the idea as to whether such souls will develop through rapid technological advancement. In an evolutionary way, with the creation and development of cyberspace, the possibility of cybercreatures appearing is theorised. This movie jumps straight to sentient cybercreatures who have no form but a program, though they are very dangerous for they can manipulate the outside world through technology. Such a creature is generated in Lawnmower man, but he was first a human. Ghost in the Shell suggests that such a creature arose out of our ignorance of what we were developing.Ghost in the Shell is a brilliant manga movie. At first I thought it was slow, but the second time I realised that though there is good action, the ideas that are prevalent throughout make it a top rating movie.Favourite Quote: Just your standard issue big gun, borrowed it from section 9 armoury and decided to keep it. Sorry that I'm a bit late, had to go home and get it.",Ghost in the Shell
16,briancham1994,High-tech world with a lot of thought,9,31 May 2020,"This movie is a good example of a science fiction film that shows a unique future world but also has a lot of thought in it. As digital technology approaches and surpasses humanity, we will question what is a soul and what is the future of our species. We can see a clear influence on The Matrix. I also can't deny that I enjoyed the inclusion of Hong Kong.",Ghost in the Shell
17,tomgillespie2002,Still one of the best examples of the genre,8,19 February 2014,"Upon Ghost in the Shell's release in 1995, the Western world was still largely unfamiliar with manga, but had already had its head turned by Katsuhiro Ohtomo's Akira (1988). Blending philosophical musings with blistering action, Ghost in the Shell captured the imagination of it's new audience, helping kick-start the Japanophilia that runs so blatantly through most modern Western cartoons and lines the bookcases of many a teenager. While it certainly has its flaws, this was the first time that casual Western audiences who were new to manga had seen a cartoon be as meditative as is explosive. And for those that didn't catch it, no doubt they would have watched The Matrix (1999) four years later, a film that arguably 'borrows' a lot more from Ghost in the Shell that it lets on.In the future, technology has become so far advanced that all aspects of life are interconnected through an electronic network. Major Motoko Kusanagi (Atsuko Tanaka), a soldier working for government agency Section 9, is a cyborg, and is able to access this network through plugs in the back of her head. She and her team are assigned to catch an elusive 'ghost-hacker' known as the Puppet Master (Iemasa Kayumi), an intelligent entity created by the government, who they lost control of when it became self-aware. When the Puppet Master surfaces in the mangled body of an artificial human shell, Kusanagi faces a crisis of identity.Disappointingly, the film begins with gratuitous nudity, showing off the fine female form (with giant breasts, of course) of Major Kusanagi just before she takes a plunge off a building to nail some bad guys. Manga caters heavily for its audience, be it sexually-frustrated, highly- stressed businessmen or horny teenagers who have no doubt been bombarded with images of giggling, short-skirted school girls throughout their young life. Thankfully, these moments are brief, and prove to be not much more than a mild distraction from the stunning animation on show. Things are grim in the future, but they're certainly beautiful to look at.The sexism aside, Kusanagi is an interesting character. When a man realises his wife and daughter are nothing more than an implanted memory, he fails to comprehend it. Kusanagi, with her mixture of organic and mechanical body parts and uploaded memories, struggled to define what it is to be human. Her hunt for the Puppet Master, who is seemingly a new kind of being, becomes a hunt for identity. Is it enough to be aware of what and who you are? The philosophy, although provocative, is heavy-handed. Conversations about humanity between Kusanagi and her second-in-command Bateau (Akio Otsuka) are delivered with a monotony worthy of a whiny emo teen, and I found the film's first half quite a head-scratcher. But things thankfully do become clearer, and the film is still, almost twenty years later, one of the best examples of the genre.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Ghost in the Shell
18,leplatypus,Cold as a shell (DVD),1,13 May 2010,"As a great fan of U2, maybe I picked up this movie because it features a track from Passengers (""One minute warning""). Unfortunately, I didn't hear this in the movie and worst, the movie is boring.The plot of a robot having human feelings and asking for its identity isn't news in science-fiction. As the masterpieces already exist (""Blade runner""; ""IA""), the subsequent movies must truly find something specific to gather attention. This one fails: The animation is slow which is anti climatic for the action sequences and dull the rest of time. Colors are sad and the story a bit complicated to understand.In conclusion, prefer Myasaki for poetry and ""Akira"" for science-fiction.",Ghost in the Shell
19,TheMovieDiorama,Ghost in the Shell is one of the most heavy philosophically themed films ever.,8,29 November 2019,"There are many many many MANY themes to take away from this cinematic experience, perhaps it is abit too heavy for its own good. The story includes a cyborg agent investigating ""The Puppet Master"" which is a virus capable of infiltrating human hosts. So already we are presented with questions such as: What is reality? Could everything be a simulation? Do memories define us or do we define memories? We have creationism, ideology, afterlife...this is not for your average moviegoer. In fact films like The Matrix took inspiration from this, bear in mind this wasn't entirely accessible to western audiences at the time of its release. It's very heavy going and the script doesn't help. It feels mechanical, which makes sense considering it's a techno thriller and that our protagonist is an emotionless cyborg, but it's so mechanical that it just doesn't flow.The lead characters are memorable, from the no nonsense cyborg Major Motoko Kusanagi to her fellow agent Batou. I loved the fact that many of the humans have cybernetic enhancements and is something that could easily be real in many years to come. I adored the computer systems, it was very green and rather cyberpunk-ish...perfect for a film from 1995. The animation was fluid, although not Studio Ghibli, and still has aged well. There are some scenes with just background music and images of the cityscape, this really drives the technological style at its core. The English dub was good apart from Major's voice actress...didn't really work for me. This is a good hard sci-fi anime, although hard to follow it's themes and style pushes this above your average animation.",Ghost in the Shell
20,digitalbeachbum,One of my top 10 animated movies,9,3 May 2020,"Originally printed in 1989, this 1995 movie is the one which really turned in to a classic movie for anyone who was already in to Japanimation/Anime or what ever you want to call it back from back then.First, The story is awersome! and the idea of a ""puppet master"" hacking in to the cyber brains of other people is thought provoking. What makes a human a human? Where is our consciousness located? What happens if you are copied and then put in to a cybernetic body? with a cybernetic brain?The animation is awersome too! I remember seeing this for the first time on a wide screen format with 5.1 in a big theatre at a movie festival. The score really puts the production over the top and when you mix it with the cinematography it really becomes a masterpiece.There are some issues though and I've never seen it corrected, but some of the scenes seem to be cut wrong or missing. I've never seen a version of this movie with any changes. I'm not sure what happened. One scene is when they were chasing the guy through the market. It seems like something is missing. There are two other scenes where it appears like part of the movie is missing. It is the only real flaw I see in the production.Overall, top 10 instantly. A must see movie for people who are in to Anime.",Ghost in the Shell
21,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Dubbed American version zaps the meaning, but not the strength of direction",6,13 June 2011,"Some films lose something in translation. ""Ghost in the Shell"" pushes a lot of philosophy, and sadly when you're stuck with a dubbed version streaming on Netflix, the wooden ""expression"" behind the dialogue fails to truly communicate these sophisticated ideas. The artistic and almost meditative direction of Mamoru Oshii comes across without interference from cultural boundaries, but ""Ghost in the Shell"" is tough to follow from the American perspective and its potential for poignancy shut out thanks to bad voice acting and general language translation.As far as how one would animate a futuristic film steeped in technological references and with a story populated by cyborgs, Oshii quite honestly nails it. Masamune Shirow's manga clearly focused on the question of what makes us human and Oshii's direction so perfectly captures the combination of human and mechanical elements. From the captivating title sequence as we see the ""birth"" of our hero, Kusanagi, there's an immediately striking contrast and blend of natural and manufactured beauty. Almost all the settings and directorial choices reflect that balance as well.Kusanagi is a cyborg police officer in a future where most people's brains and souls or ""ghosts"" exist in mechanical bodies. She and her unit are on the case of a renowned hacker called ""The Puppet Master,"" who ultimately challenges what she believes in. I wish I could explain with any depth, but most of it was lost on me.Kusanagi draws you in as a cyborg protagonist. Oshii paints her as this fragile doll of sorts, with lingering shots expressive of deep thought which we might not normally believe a cyborg capable. Although her behavior outside of that deep dialogue is mostly mechanical, we care for her rather instantly.She can also kick some ass, which is important in this film. The action is much grittier than usual anime fare but with the same artistic flair you'd expect from the genre.Occasionally some long scenes without dialogue and just music come into the picture to allow focus on the well-animated world of Section 9. The pause doesn't help matters of focus, but it does highlight the undeniable strengths of the film: the technical aspects and the animation.I would honestly have to watch this film again to understand it, so perhaps a higher score would come with a second viewing as it warrants this many stars on art and direction alone.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Ghost in the Shell
22,Vartiainen,A hallmark picture,8,20 June 2017,"One of the first anime feature films to gain a foothold in the Western world, Ghost in the Shell has since gone to influence a whole generation of science fiction with its sleek visuals and heavy themes of machine versus humanity.And yeah, the film definitely holds up even today. The animation, groundbreaking on its day, is still really impressive and near flawless. The characters are identifiable and varied, with no unneeded soul to be seen. The music and storytelling are both professional and haunting in quality.But it's the story that people talk about and what made this film such a hit. And the story is... complicated. Personally I do think it jumps around a bit too much and ends more then bit abruptly, but I can also see that its themes and style have more than enough depth to pull people in and make this into a cult classic. What it means to be human? Can someone at some point stop being a human and become something more? Or something less? Are we defined by our memories or the other way around?Personally I have the problem of already having examined most of these questions through other films and stories, many of them drawing influence from this very franchise. Thus the original film itself didn't have as much to offer. Nevertheless, it's still an impressive film by any measure and well worth a watch for all.",Ghost in the Shell
23,Polaris_DiB,From an American perspective...,9,11 November 2005,"When this film was released in theatres in the US, it was denounced by some critics for being ""too philosophical."" It's amazing how often that term comes up around great works of art. Socrates, Jesus, Ayn Rand... so many people denounced for being ""too philosophical."" Honestly.Anyways, I am relatively unfamiliar with most Japanese animation, but I am a great fan of cyberpunk films and this one fits the ticket well. In the future, when the information age has grown to the level of cities and structural definitions of separation between machine and human are breaking down, a feminine cyborg is hunting down a mysterious hacker called the Puppet Master who's history and purpose remains completely unknown.The animation here is really beautiful and contains magnificent imagery. One of the great things about going with animation as opposed to filming sets and the like is that every shadow, light, and body is completely controllable, even if it's just added in as an afterthought. Nothing in this film seems just ""added in,"" though, as everything from the city to the nudity is of symbolic import.It's also clear that this film is yet another of the many various works that culminated inspired the Wachowski brothers. A lot of the imagery of this film is very much reminiscent of The Matrix (or, to put it more accurately, The Matrix is very reminiscent of this film).It's not actually much on the action side of things (though it has it's moments), but it certainly is worth the watch, especially to see mostly the imagery and how the characters live and interact with it.--PolarisDiB",Ghost in the Shell
24,dee.reid,It found a voice... and a following,10,5 August 2004,"""Ghost in the Shell"" is an intricate masterpiece of cyber-punk fiction and storytelling, successfully melding intriguing philosophical ideas with a coherent, well thought-out (albeit) confusing plot.Even more, it's a nightmarish vision of a society that's dominated by cyberspace and looking back now, is eerily prescient of today's computerized times. Many of the characters in the film are enhanced, someway or another by machines, to help them get the advantage in a vastly changing society.I'll avoid going real deep into the plot simply because there's a whole lot to grasp and even I got more than a little confused trying to follow it. The story is that a team of high-level government operatives are hot on the trail of a notorious computer hacker called the ""Puppet Master,"" who is wanted for various crimes in cyberspace and has taken a particularly fond interest in the team's tough, female cyborg leader.Not surprisingly, as with the stigmas surrounding Anime', ""Ghost in the Shell"" is not short of nudity and graphic violence. But it's far from being gratuitous, and does not slow down the movie at all.""Ghost in the Shell"" was one of the first Anime' films to skillfully blend traditional drawn animation with computerized imagery. This helps to give the film a surreal, yet beautiful look. And the dialogue helps sometimes too, with helping to sort out the confusing plot and many of its mythical ideas about personal identity and human evolution.This film is also even more revered today, in 2004, since some of this film's core themes helped to develop the plot basis of the insanely popular ""Matrix"" films, and some scenes from ""Ghost in the Shell"" were even homaged to in the first ""Matrix"" movie. The Wachowski Brothers certainly do owe a lot to this movie for the success of their work in America.I think that to understand ""Ghost in the Shell,"" it would help to accept that Anime' is much more complex and daring than traditional American animation. Most Japanese animation films, like this one, ""Akira,"" or Mayazaki's ""Spirited Away,"" are on a level of sophistication that will never be matched in America. It has been said that the majority of American audiences would be afraid of Anime' because of the many stereotypes surrounding it, but that's why it's boundless - it's been given free reign to use those stigmas to its advantage in developing truly remarkable pieces of art that have gone largely ignored here in the U.S. ""Ghost in the Shell"" could very well be a mere reflection or a parable of a doomed society that's probably already accepted its dark fate. Most American animation would never touch up on this sort of subject matter.""Ghost in the Shell"" is my #3 choice Anime' film (behind ""Spirited Away"" and ""Akira"") because it's so full of ideas and is masterful in telling a dark story about our times.10/10",Ghost in the Shell
25,drqshadow-reviews,"A Tantalizing, Timeless Blend of Art, Music, Philosophy and Suspense",9,15 March 2017,"Deep dives into the nature of consciousness with a side platter of police action, gunplay and high-speed pursuit. At first glance this may come off as stiff and impenetrable, but like the thematically-similar Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell offers untold rewards to repeat viewers. The nature of our memories, how they define us, and the dangers of nefarious interference upon them; these are some pretty heavy topics, and it should come as no surprise that it takes some time to really let it all sink in. Reflective and immersive, the film spends a lot of time ruminating on the meaning of life - both in conversation and in the long, lingering glances of city still-life it indulges upon between bursts of action. In these scenes, Kenji Kawai's magnificent score really gets a chance to shine; haunting and alien, it's a strange beauty and a perfect pairing for the uneasy-in-your-own-skin themes explored by the film. The art direction is a similar brow-raiser, effectively bringing the residents and landscape of New Port City to life in a style that remains loyal to Masamune Shirow's original work while also carving out a bold, fresh identity of its own. It's rare for a twenty-year-old film about technology to still remain relevant in a modern light, but this one somehow seems even more appropriate today. The advent of smartphones and tablets alone has brought the essence of human interaction up for debate, and this lonesome vision of a near-future Japan now seems hauntingly prescient. A conceptual powerhouse, it does have faults - far too many stationary talking heads, breathlessly spouting plot points - but inarguably deserves its status as one of eastern animation's cornerstones. I fear its subtlety and nuance will be lost upon Hollywood's forthcoming live-action adaptation.",Ghost in the Shell
26,kirbylee70-599-526179,Before Watching The Remake,10,8 April 2017,"There are a number of films making their way to the big screen these days that are either remakes or sequels to other popular films. Most become franchise films, movies that can turn into a series of films based on consumers being familiar with the title and thus ensuring that there are people ready to line up and buy tickets. Some view this as a good thing, others hate it. It all depends on how familiar you are with the original and how much it means to you.Such will be the case when GHOST IN THE SHELL starring Scarlett Johansson comes out soon. Some will be drawn to it seeing the visuals on display in the trailer and some will come because they are fans of Johansson. But a certain number of those patrons will be there because they are fans of anime and the original telling of this story that was released in 1995. If you are unfamiliar with it then now is the time to pick up the original as Anchor Bay is releasing the original film with special packaging this week.For those unfamiliar with the term anime it is a Japanese animated motion picture that is geared towards adults more so than children, often based on manga or Japanese comics, again aimed at adults. GHOST IN THE SHELL was one of the most popular at one time and ranks highly among the fans of the genre.The story revolves around a counter-cyberterrorist group known as Public Security Section 9 and its best agent, Major Motoko Kusanagi. Major is not an ordinary agent though. She is a cyborg, mostly machine but part human as well. The term ghost refers to this as it refers to what others would call her soul, the human part of her that has been integrated into this body she now uses, enhanced with biomechanics.This first story revolves around Section 9 trying to track down and capture someone known only at the Puppet Master. The Puppet Master essentially hacks into various people who have been cybernetically enhanced and then using them to commit various crimes, most often connected with stealing information and secrets from the government. Once he finishes with them he drops his connection leaving behind someone with no clue what is and isn't real in their minds any longer.As Major and Section 9 track down the Puppet Master they think they've caught their man, sort of. What they have is the remnants of a cyborg that he has transferred his ghost into. But before they can discover just what is really going on another section moves in to retrieve the cyborg. Even then things change as the Puppet Master finds a way to avoid capture and reach out the Major at the same time. Whether she will reach out to find what is really going on or not isn't revealed until the last portion of the film.The movie is a visual feast for the eyes with so much to look at that you'll never want to take your eyes off the screen. Displays of the world of the future mingle with non-stop action sequences that make you wonder how the live-action film will be able to repeat what you see here (though clips so far look like they may have it down). The closest I can come to describing it is to suggest the film BLADE RUNNER and the cityscapes found in that film.While watching the film you find yourself so caught up in the story that you'll soon forget the fact that this is an animated feature. It draws you into the story that well and holds you there, rooting for the good guys, trying to figure out just who the real bad guys are and wondering when it comes to robots down the line will they possess a soul or not? Since they are created by man, can that be a possibility? This is one of the best science fiction films in years because it isn't just about the technology on hand but what lies beneath as well.As I said it is geared towards adults to expect nudity and extreme violence to be found. Nothing lewd but it is there. For this reason I wouldn't recommend it for children. But for adults this is a movie worth seeking out and for science fiction fans one worth adding to your collection.",Ghost in the Shell
27,truemythmedia,A Masterpiece,10,29 May 2019,"This is the third time I've seen this film. The first time I saw it, I didn't understand it. I was still young in my film education and watched movies the way most people do, passively, as if it was music on the radio in the background of whatever I was doing.The second time I watched it, I was very tired but I grasped a little more of it and was impressed by how ahead of its time it was. It still blows me away that this movie came out before the Matrix made certain ideas about the connectivity of technology commonplace amongst the general population.This third viewing, I realize that this is one of my favorite Anime films, and animated films in general, which I have ever formed a relationship with.

28,TheOneThatYouWanted,Boycott whitewashing and watch this instead,8,4 February 2017,"I am boycotting the upcoming Ghost in the Shell film because it is whitewashed for no reason. In this day and age whitewashing isn't necessary. Whatever, it gave me a reason to finally watch this anime classic. I never felt like watching this or any of the Ghost in the Shell films because in the world of anime lovers Ghost in the Shell comes off as too mainstream. After watching, I can see why it has a following, and I think it should only be a standalone film because the world-building involved is literally 75% of the plot. So sequels to this film must play off as filler, not that I would know or would want to know. Regardless, the upcoming live-action film looks like garbage. I'm not going to watch it. If you really, really really want to watch the live-action Ghost in the Shell, just watch this film instead. You'll save yourself time and money. But more importantly, you'll send Hollywood a message. That message being to get out of the stone age.",Ghost in the Shell
29,Samiam3,Animé-zing,8,14 June 2009,"Starting from that brilliant title theme over those digital, Matrix-style opening credits, Ghost In The Shell is a hauntingly mystical and stunning experience. Despite an occasionally confusing plot and a certain lack of closure to the ending, with this film, director Mamoru Oshii could rival Hayao Miyazaki(Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away) for the best artistic creativity in Japanesse animation. This is one not to be missed.It is tricky to summarize this elaborate story, I can't say I've heard of anything like it. Our protagonist is a cunning young police officer who with the help of her comrades has to stop an international hacker called the Puppet Master who has worked his way into some of the government's most advanced technology in the super city where the movie is set. In this version of the future, man has the ability to not only separate a soul(or ghost) from a body, but also the ability to manipulate and program people's ghosts, which among other things is the key to being in the ideal physical form. As a consequence, people in this world have become biological-cyborgs.Ghost in the Shell is so unique in its vision and advanced in art that we the viewers cannot help but be drawn into every minute of the film; art, action, animation, amazement, Ghost in the Shell has it all.",Ghost in the Shell

31,eric262003,Excels In Many Fascinating Elements,10,10 October 2021,"There is a lot to like about this Japanese anime film, I could talk about for hours (but I won't). ""Ghost in the Shell"". Though not played for cheap laughs or super climactic action battles, it's a cyberpunk story that raises a lot of questions concerning our future and has a more intellectual and philosophical side to it. ""Ghost in the Shell"" is one of the most successful anime movies to make its way into the Western society and may have been the inspiration for the ""Matrix"" films that came out in the late 1990's and early 2000's. At a running time of only 85 minutes long, the film never wastes a single minute going over the details and right away take you on a wild ride.With limited anime films to ever cross the Western borders, ""Ghost in the Shell"" is far from being an animted film for the younger age demographic. Disturbing subject matter like violence, nudity and vulgarity takes place in this movie, plus you don't find adorable cartoony characters featured here. But rest assured, ""Ghost in the Shell"" has many memorable scenes, your heart will stop beating but your memories will linger on. Such memorable scenes have our leading protagonist Major Motoko Kusanagi (Atsuko Tanaka) showcases her talent by perched on top of a skyscraper, strips off her clothing, leaps off and at midway point, makes herself invisible.Set in the year 2029, technology has become so advanced that humans now have the ability to augment or even have their bodies replaced using cybernetic parts. The story is that a hacker simply known as the Puppet Master has made his way to Section 9 in ""New Port City"" in Japan. But then government forces make their way in, passing it off as global conspiracy to conceal that the Puppet Master even exists. Now it's up to Kusanagi to put a stop to this Puppet Master and stop his reign of terror.Sure this movie has often been labeled as the brain-child of the highly popular franchise ""The Matrix"" in terms of ideas and themes, scenery and shots. But what the Wachowski siblings missed the point on was their ""Matrix"" movies lacked the philosophical elements that was provided in ""Ghost in theShell"".The big struggle our hero has in this movie is that Kusanagi is conflicted by her own idenity and her own true self. While ""The Matrix"" plays it safe by replacing the philosophical teachings from this movie and playing to a more blockbuster route with more kung-fu action and gunfighting and that the cyberpunk story is more in the background.The reason that ""Ghost in the Shell"" is much shorter then ""The Matrix"" is because we get exposed to the characters right away. We see cyborgs consuming beer which may not seem flashy or visually stunning, but effective in what world we've entered. These characters try to merge with both the human world and the cybernetic ones and grappling of who they are is both amazing and also very conflicting at the same time. The movie itself understands what cyberpunk is all about, creating a fantasy atmosphere by blending human and machines into one generic universe.Kusanagi spends a lot of the film in the nude. Not because she's there to arouse perverted men who gravitate to cartoon flesh. There's no time or need for her get romantic or seductive, when you think about it, she can barely even function as a human anymore. To her, her body is nothing more than an apparatus used to take down criminals. And sure on the outside her flesh may appear to the beauty and allure, but underneath it's all steel making her feel like a machine going incognito as a human.The animation featured here is simply complex meaning it's way ahead of its time before 3D animation took over. It's right up there along with other animated greats in the anime community like ""Akira"" and ""Spirited Away"". It showed that hand-drawn animation can still be amazing by putting your heart over your head into it and the details feel more advanced like a graphic novel coming life as opposed to silly comic strip like animation we are mostly accustomed to. The way the machinery operates has a more realistic edge to it and knows when to limit itself from being over stylized.""Ghost in the Shell"" is truly a remarkable animed film that's original in content, while also makes you consider if humans will become this way in the near future. It's both exciting while at the same time a very scary thing to think about. The characters and the settings seem more real than compared to most animated films and a lot of heart was put into it.",Ghost in the Shell
32,lewiskendell,A slightly flawed anime classic.,7,24 August 2010,"""And where does the newborn go from here? The net is vast and infinite.""Science fiction can often make you feel like you're in a philosophy class, and sci-fi anime usually does that as a rule. Ghost in the Shell is no exception.Questions of what makes an entity a human being and the ramifications of increasing artificial intelligence on what we define as a ""person"" are all woven into an action story about conspiracies in a near-future Hong Kong and a world where human beings connect themselves directly to the Internet and each other. This opens people up to the danger of having their minds hacked by outside influences, and it's just such an incident that sends the cyborg Major Kusaragi and her team of government agents on the trail of a mysterious hacker known as The Puppet Master. It's really a simple story, but it attempts to go quite deeply into some of the areas I mentioned previously. The writing isn't quite up to the task of adequately communicating the ideas that are being presented, but if you like to think along with your sci-fi anime action, you'll be comfortably at home, here. The animation is quite good for 1995, the plot and characters are interesting, and it all moves along at a brisk clip that makes subsequent viewings anything but a chore. I still prefer the two series that were spawned by Ghost in the Shell to the original feature, but it's nice to revisit this from time to time.",Ghost in the Shell
33,Lady_Targaryen,It Found A Voice... Now It Needs A Body,7,9 August 2006,"''Kôkaku kidôtai'' well known as ''Ghost in the Shell'' is a manga series created by the excellent artist Masamune Shirow that was adapted in two movies and an anime series. Even being far from the deep world from the manga, this film is a classic to people who enjoy the cyberpunk genre and who loved movies like Akira and Matrix.(''Matrix'', by the way, would be the best example of a movie who was inspired by ''Ghost in the Shell'', with their plugs at the top of the spine, the existentialist and philosophical questions the characters pass through, among other things.)The sentence that maybe fits this movie better is:''Where is the boundary between human and machine when the differences between the two become more philosophical than physical?''It is interesting to notice that in Motoko's world, even humans are a little cyborgs, since everybody has mechanical parts to enhance their bodies, like an upgrade to a human's debility.

I know I'm gonna get a lot of flak for this one.""Ghost in the Shell"" is without doubt an incredible achievement in animation, and stands as a classic of its genre. An adaptation of a beloved Manga source material, director Mamoru Oshii's 1995 film is often a powerhouse of keen visual design, true-to-life motion and subtle, heady themes. And it most definitely deserves to be celebrated and beloved. It's a pretty great film, with a lot to enjoy both on the aesthetic surface and in the provocative ideas below. And it also deserves special commendation for being one of the first true breakout anime hits for many Western audiences, paving the way for Anime to take the world by storm. I remember being blown away by it the first time I viewed it about ten years ago, and I hold it in a pretty high regard.I just don't think it's quite as perfect as it's oft made out to be.Please! Put down the torches and pitchforks and hear me out, because I know that statement is going to anger a lot of people who hold this film high as an example of perfection. I'm not saying it's a bad film. From from it. But in the grand scheme of anime and the Science Fiction genre, I do think this type of story has been done a bit better on several occasions, and that the film does have a small handful of wonky moments that don't quite work, mainly pertaining to a few minor weaknesses in the writing and storytelling. It's a great film. Heck, I'd still call it a classic myself. But it's also a mildly flawed one.In a near future where technology has so advanced that the human body can be augmented or even replaced completely by cybernetic material, an entity known as Section 9 operates to protect key secrets and eliminate potential threats, without having to be constrained by corporate or political red-tape. At the head of it all is a cyborg known as Major Motoko Kusanagi, who serves as the leader of Section 9's assault team. When a mysterious cyber- terrorist known as the ""Puppet Master"" shows himself in a serious strange and bizarre incidents, Section 9 is on the case. However, probing into the matter, Major Kusanagi comes to find a treacherous web of political deceit and morally ambiguous circumstances that will leave her questioning her loyalties and just what it means to be alive...One of the greatest things about the film is also the source of one of its more noticeable weaknesses... that being the story. It's a very well thought out and generally solidly structure tale that lends itself well to analysis and deeper pondering. With complex and very rich themes of sexuality, gender identity and the concept of what constitutes ""life"", the film has many great talking points, and there's also plenty of fascinating twists and turns along the way to supply entertainment for those who are looking more for a traditional film. That being said, I can't help but feel the movie is fundamentally trying to do too much, too quickly and that it's pacing and handling of key dialog can be suspect from time to time. It's strange... the film often alternates between two key issues that I have with complex story lines... those being that it often holds the audiences hands a bit too much with blatant exposition dumps, while also being needlessly vague at other times. In a way, I'd compare it to the original entry in the ""Matrix"" franchise for that same reason. It wants to be a cryptic and masterful philosophical exploration piece... but every couple scenes it grinds to a halt so they can dump about five minutes of expository dialog that comes out and states what we should be thinking about instead of just letting us think it. But it doesn't do this consistently, and sometimes the ideas at play are vague to the point of being almost completely lost without frequently repeated viewings. It's a good story with great ideas... it's just a bit too... uneven to rise to the level of perfection.But beyond the story, the rest of the production is pretty much a top-notch affair all around. Characters are well-established, generally quite likable and lend a lot to the story being presented. I could just watch 90 minutes of Major and her friend/Section 9 accomplice Batou shoot the breeze, they have such a good dynamic. The visual design of the film is absolutely spellbinding and holds up incredibly well. It's beautifully conceived and expertly realized. The action, though limited, is very well-choreographed and very much leaves you on the edge of your seat. The bizarrely (and bizarrely good) experimental musical score will stay with you long after you turn the film off. And the animation is absolutely gorgeous. It's smooth. Fluid. Nails the right balance between realism and stylization. And has left its mark in the worlds of both Science Fiction and anime.""Ghost in the Shell"" is a phenomenal film that's held just shy of perfection, and it's OK to admit that. Admitting its minor flaws does nothing to tarnish its outstanding legacy or its generally exceedingly high quality. It's influence is still felt to this day and it remains one of the most widely beloved works of its genre. And you can't deny that.I give it a fantastic 9 out of 10.",Ghost in the Shell
35,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Compulsory viewing for any anime fan and newcomer.,9,4 October 2016,"Ghost in the Shell is a beautifully directed, well-written, complex look at an all-digital-world where being a human or android is basically a blurred line. Are we our shells, or is it the ghost (our spirits) inside that defines us? Mamoru Oshii directs this film like Ridley Scott would have directed Blade Runner back in the day; it's got a similar sensibility but Ghost in the Shell becomes its own beautiful sci-fi experience that is one to be remembered.Japan has always been among the very best countries to give the world innovative cinema. Ghost in the Shell, like Akira before it, broke new ground in the field of Japanese animation and combined traditional 35mm-filmed cel-animation with occasional computer animation used to assist the whole cyberpunk aesthetic that still stands out today, even after the craze in the 90s.Ghost in the Shell is a smart, wonderful film to look at, and its director gives us an experience that is still a science fiction classic.",Ghost in the Shell
36,blott2319-1,Flawed but still solid,6,2 June 2020,"My thoughts on Ghost in the Shell are split right down the middle, so I feel the need to break this review up into the pros and cons. Let's start with the bad news so we can end on a high note. I hated the fact that these cyborgs could communicate without speaking. It meant there were a number of long sequences where nothing was happening on screen, to the point that I thought perhaps I was having trouble with the streaming of the film because it looked like they froze on a still image. This also meant I had to be well acquainted with the sounds of the different voices, so I'd know who was ""talking."" Thankfully, most of the time the words were supposed to be coming from the person on screen, so it didn't take as much deduction. There were several sequences where it felt like the film stopped in order to just show us some visuals, and that was kind of obnoxious as well. Finally, at times it felt like the movie went overboard with its existential thoughts, which threatened to take away from the mystery plot.That being said, I did enjoy some of the headier thoughts that are brought up in Ghost in the Shell. The exploration of consciousness and what amounts to a living being (or even a soul) is intriguing. I appreciated that the entire sci-fi plot kind of boils down to a more traditional detective story. In some ways it had the tone of a film noir, and I liked that aspect. Ghost in the Shell is a good-looking anime film. There were a number of gorgeous shots that would be winning cinematography awards if they were done in live-action. I was carried along for the ride by the film, even when I didn't totally understand what was happening. It's the kind of movie that doesn't explain every detail of the plot, and at times that made it hard to follow. But I appreciate when they allow the audience to puzzle through some things, and I think that gives a film greater rewatchability. In the end, I came out slightly more positive on Ghost in the Shell and will consider watching it again, but it was riding the line enough that after a rewatch I might decide it's not for me.",Ghost in the Shell
37,Stephen_A_Abell,Humanity Has Underestimated The Consequences,10,29 March 2017,"I had quite forgotten how wonderful, inciteful, imaginative, and beautiful this film is. Since Hollywood is making their own version of this film I thought I would revisit the original itself.America will ruin this movie.What writer, Masamune Shirow (Manga Author), and screenwriter, Kazunori Ito, give the audience in Ghost In The Shell is a deep and thought- provoking story of a world on the edge of great change. It's the year 2029 and most of the population have been augmented with machinery and computerisation. People are able to send thoughts through the wires and electronic ether to each other as well as verbally. Cyborgs are used to help to police the civilisations.Major Motoko Kusanagi is one of these cyborgs. She works for Section Nine who are on the trail of The Puppet Master; a hacker who can infiltrate his way into a person's shell and use their ghost to assassinate officials. Though, The Puppet Master is not what he seems.As the story progresses and the truth is revealed we asked a question... What actually represents life? This looks to be a simple question, however, in the context of the story it expands to absorbing and provocative magnitudes.This is a story with heart and thought.What makes this movie and story even more substantial is the animation. Within this film are some great shots and scenes. I love the way that even the backgrounds are so detailed and add to the feel and atmosphere of the film itself.This is a visually stunning piece of work that should be viewed for that fact alone. In addition, the musical soundtrack of Kenji Kawai is superb as matches the artwork and feel of the film. In one montage Kawai music and the accompanying images emote a feeling of sadness, despair, and hope in the viewer.If you haven't watched this yet then do yourself a favour and find yourself a copy to watch.

While the animation is of course top-notch, it tackles some philosophically heady material that sets it apart from what I've seen before. The year is 2029, and in this future world technological augmentation of the human body has become a normal thing. There are also ""ghosts"" (basically disembodied consciousness, I think) which can operate independently of cyborg bodies, or ""shells."" The plot is about the efforts of a government department trying to catch a villainous hacker known as ""The Puppetmaster."" Like the other two anime I saw previously (AKIRA and PAPRIKA), GHOST IN THE SHELL deals with human's relationship to technology and how it can positively or negatively affect the our collective experience. In this one, however, the primary philosophical concern is the nature of consciousness and what it means to be alive. In a world where artificial intelligence can exist independent of a physical form, would you consider it to be ""living""? That's just one of the many thought-provoking questions the film asks, and attempts to answer. From the technical side of things, I thought the hand-drawn animation was absolutely spectacular and the world-building was amazing as well. There was so much attention to detail that it made this future seem believable. I also liked the score which struck the right tone, kind of a BLADE RUNNER-esque futuristic noir. The only things I can find to complain about are really hardly complaints, though. First, a few of the voice actors in this dub were kind of awkward-sounding, and second, some of the computer animation/graphics date the film somewhat. Outside of that, however, everything here was exceptionally well-done. Overall, GHOST IN THE SHELL tells a fast-paced, intelligent story that has influenced science-fiction in so many ways (without this film, there'd be no MATRIX). If you're an anime fan, you've probably already seen it, but this would make a good entry point for those just getting into anime (like myself).",Ghost in the Shell
39,emasterslake,Mamoru Oshii's masterpiece.,8,9 September 2006,"I just saw this movie recently. And it's a classic.Taken place in 2029 A.D. Computers are very advance, and more people are connected to the computer networks than before.Human Cyborgs have advanced to look human, act human, and have memories like a human. They're so advanced that sometimes they don't know they're not real. Most cyborgs resemble those who died.Major Motoko Kusanagi is a female cyborg who works for the Section 9 cyborg police. She often wonders if she ever was a real person or just an A.I. Her past is unclear, but she does have great cybernetic skills to keep the peace around the net and the city.Her partner Bateau, is also a cyborg who has some skills of his own. He's always there to help or calm Motoko down during any situation.A hacker has been roaming about hacking into cyborg's computer brains. Goes by the ""Puppet Master"". Section 9 has no info on whether they're dealing with a human or a cyborg. It's up to Motoko and Bateau to investigate this crime.Ghost in the Shell is way past the average anime. It even broke the limits to Japanese animation, with it's computer animation and extra smooth cell animation mixed into one movie.It even has some similar elements you'd find in an average Mamoru movie with Basset Hounds and Guns. The story is pretty good. The characters well drawn, and the visuals are just excellent. Any average anime fan would consider this a masterpiece in most ways.Those who liked Mamoru's Patalbor movies will like this one. It's available in 6 different languages including original Japanese on the Special Edition DVD. I recommend it for 17 and up. Due to it having strong violence, strong language, and a lot of nudity.",Ghost in the Shell
40,rainking_es,Quite entertaining,7,27 September 2006,"I was curious about ""Ghost in the shell"" because of all those people who said that ""Matrix"" was a plagiarism of this animation movie. As for the movie itself I must say it's so entertaining, full of futuristic philosophy, the animations are just OK, and the script has such rhythm (although is a little bit confusing and hard to follow -or maybe I'm getting too old for this kind of products-).Regarding to the accusations of plagiarism, well, there are many points in common with ""Matrix"": the titles, some characteristics of the characters (the way they're connected to each other with those receivers in the nape).In short: quite entertaining and much more serious than most of nowadays futuristic cinema.*My rate: 7/10",Ghost in the Shell
41,swilliky,Intriguing animated cyborg story,6,30 March 2017,"The future is strange with robots and brain-hacking in the animated Ghost in the Shell. The film that sparked a life action update over twenty years later begins with Motoko Kusanagi jumping from a building to assassinate a diplomat. She put on a mission to hunt down a hacker known as the Puppet Master. She finds that this hacker is using garbage and other criminals through trickery and mind-hacking to do his bidding. Motoko also copes with her identity as a robot while still trying to do human things like scuba dive. The action of the chases seems pretty cool and I can only imagine what a live action adaption will look like.The artwork in the animation is stunning capturing the look of a manga comic. The English dubbed version I purchased did have some weak voice-acting and an odd look common in these adaptations, which is why I usually try to see these things with subtitles. Questions of humanity and existence are brought up as the Puppet Master claims to be a sentient being with rights despite not having a sole body. Even Major Motoko isn't sure if she is a human with a body bought from a tech company and brain cells input into it. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Ghost in the Shell

43,tomimt,A disappointment,6,4 July 2006,"I don't actually know what I really was expecting but after hearing so much positive things about 'Ghost in the Shell' I was really disappointed of what I finally saw.The marriage of flesh, mind and machinery. Can the machine, or artificial intelligence become self aware? What makes humans human? Can a self aware entity become human if it can live, give birth and finally die like everyone else. These are the question and the holding theme of the movie. And it brings nothing new to these questions. Philosophical babble flings left and right among pretty imaginary yet I was left more bored than amused. I felt nothing for the characters, thus their existence became secondary for me.'Ghost in the Shell' has a couple of effective and well directed scenes in it but overall, after considering all the great things said about it, I really couldn't see why this film has been chosen as a marker of sci-fi anime of this genre. Maybe people settle for lesser things than I've thought or maybe I'm not japanned enough... yet.",Ghost in the Shell

And once you finally get it, keep watching.",9,4 August 2020,"While it can often feel rushed or too dependent on hard to follow exposition due to its unfairly short runtime, Ghost in the Shell is a movie that rises above almost all of its problems thanks to the sheer scope of its ambitious themes and ideas, gorgeous animation and fantastic world building.It definitely requires repeated viewings. I'm pretty sure that by the last time I saw it years ago I had finally gotten it, but rewatching it now I was lost again. But that's great, because now I get to re-rewatch it, which is always a treat.There's a sequence towards the middle of the films that ranks amongst my favorites not just in animation, but in cinema as a whole. It's a three minute long sequence of almost nothing but shots of the city, and it (accompanied by the incredible soundtrack) creates an almost transcendent atmosphere that perfectly encapsulates the grace and beauty that lies beneath the surface of this film.That beauty is what keeps me coming back to it, even when I have trouble keeping up with it.",Ghost in the Shell

Cyberbrains of some humans and mainly cyborgs have a subconscious called a ""Ghost"" but some of their ghosts can be hacked in by cyber-criminals especially of the most infamous of them all known as The Puppet-Master that can manipulate humans like puppets in their ghosts. Female cyborg cop Motoko ""Major"" Kusanagi and partner Batou hunt down this mastermind to find out what schemes this person is hatching.Absolutely brilliant and visually stunning work of animation from Japan! based on Masamine Shirow's popular comics, this Mamoru Oshii directed cyberpunk Sci-fi action thriller offers such amazing anime that broke the anime mold like it's cousin ""Akira"" which this film is from the producers of. And like ""Akira"", it became a phenomenal movie that got the public into anime when it hit US theaters as well as Hayao Miyazaki's work and even Voltron on TV back in the 80's.What i also like about this movie is that it's a cerebral and intelligent work of art that deals with what it's like to either be human or machine, it questions the nature of humanity. There is a lot of nudity in this picture from Kusanagi who is quite sexy but not as sexy as her TV show/Manga counterpart, i really loved this back in 96 when i bought it on video when i was 14 years old after being blown away by ""Akira"" as i had an anime addiction since then. You can tell this influenced many filmmakers over the years including everyone from James Cameron, Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg, Guillermo Del Toro, Zack Snyder and more who praised this work of art and inspired The Matrix big time.Also recommended: ""Akira"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Total Recall"", ""Avatar"", ""Minority Report"", ""The Island"", ""The Matrix Trilogy plus Animatrix"", ""Serenity"", ""Terminator 1 & 2"", ""Armitage III"", ""Project A-Ko"", ""Ninja Scroll"", ""Surrogates"" and ""The Fifth Element"".",Ghost in the Shell

The story is filled with thought-provoking ideas about sentience and life that will keep you pondering long after the credits.

49,blackmamba99971,Mind blowing tale,10,9 February 2017,"One of the greatest achievements since Akira. Ghost in the shell had brought forth a stylized, but terrifying aspect to our human condition. Motoka or Major is a female cyborg thrust into a world of construct, and technology to stop cyber-terrorists from attacking the human race using computers as weapons. Although done by technology there are scenes with a good amount of physical, as well as weaponry for those who do not abide by the laws of cyber-life.The major tracks down a life form by the name of The Puppet master because of its innate ability to sway or change conditions while on the internet. It's reasoning is simply to extend its own life by merging with the major so that he, can live on even if he died by the hands of his own creators at Section 6. Needless to say many others who were corralled into such a situation were also puppets although they did not know the real world from their own, which helped conceal the master from prying eyes.The story is fantastic with imaginative sequences through out as characters or extras had their own parts to play among environment characters. It gave a more life like aspect along with the haunting soundtrack provided by Kenji Kawai who has been recalled in to do a new live action inception where Scarlett Johansson takes the lead role as the Major. The soundtrack is also included with some new additional percussion, which adds a remarkable flavor to this classic genre.Ghost in the shell has been a fan favourite for over twenty years, and right now will be again when it is released in march of 2017. Highly recommended for adults. Story, plot, theme, and exquisite scenes makes ghost in the shell a long lived tale of technology in a world where it could do without. Also this movie was the template for the mega-hit series trilogy The Matrix by the Wachowski Brothers before they decided to change their genders to female.

50,PyrolyticCarbon,"Fantastic story, amazing ideas, stunning soundtrack, praise, praise...",8,24 November 1999,"Like many Manga films I feel this crams a lot of story, past and present, and incredibly inventive ideas into an extremely short space of time. The character development is extremely rapid and rips you straight into the story so you find yourself really listening and trying to understand each scene. I don't necessarily think these are bad points, it forces you to think and become absorbed much more than any other film.The storyline, and ideas hidden beneath it, provide a great insight into life, and what consider actually constitutes the label of ""being alive"".This is an extremely intelligent piece of work, yet there seems to be no real conclusion, it stops short of completing any claims it made earlier in the film and seems to end in the middle of its story.The sound is unbelievably stunning on DVD Dolby Digital, with some of the most haunting music sequences I've ever heard, you really feel the music is around you! The visuals are of an amazing calibre with realism being high on the film makers agenda.I just feel that there's been too much fired at the audience too quickly. I definately wouldn't have minded this film being longer, allowing it to make more of the story and build the characters more, especially that of the Puppet Master.Still, it's stunning.

These classic characters are well written and the dubbing is great, the voice over actors that took care of the dubbing does a great job and can be commended. But a warning to parents, the type of parent who went to see Gremlins without paying attention to the trailer.

52,avik-basu1889,The search for an identity !!!,9,17 October 2015,"'Ghost in the Shell' is a Japanese animated film based on a manga of the same name. Directed by Mamoru Oshii and written by Kazunori Itō, it is based in a dystopian future where a major section of the population has been cybernised. We meet Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg who works for the government in Section 9 and is called upon to do their 'dirty' work along with the other cyborgs. The major plot of the film revolves around the pursuit of a powerful hacker named 'The Puppet Master' by Motoko and the other cyborg cops on the order of the government. The extent to which every human being is cybernised varies. But Motoko is almost completely artificial. But like other cyborgs, she has been provided a 'ghost' inside her which effectively is equivalent to the soul of a human being. Thematically, the film explores all the insecurities and dilemmas that Motoko faces regarding her identity. In spite of the presence of the 'ghost' inside her, at a deeper level she knows that she can never be humane. She thinks she will always remain a government product which is supposed to carry out their orders without having an identity of her own.'Ghost in the Shell' is a film that strongly belongs to the cyberpunk genre. The influence of other artistic works belonging to this particular genre like Blade Runner and Neuromancer can be easily noticed in this film. Like other Cyberpunk stories, this film's storyline also thematically revolves around identity. Motoko's psychological struggle to find a singular unique identity for herself gets conveyed through blatant verbal conversations and also through beautiful metaphoric visuals. There is a beautiful scene where Motoko dives into the sea and goes deep inside. But when she swims back up to the surface she watches a reflection on the surface of the water and gradually merges with the reflection. She later said that although diving isn't something which is advised for cyborgs, but she still does it because that makes her feel vulnerable and scared like a human when she is in the water. But when she comes up she looks at the reflection and feels like she becomes a new individual. So the diving is a way for her to feel like a human. She has an identity inside the water. Outside the water she is again a government property. There is another masterful sequence where Motoko takes a ferry ride through the grim, dark cityscape. The sequence is rich with beautiful moments where Motoko just quietly observes the city and its people. She watches the mannequins in the stores. Reflections are used very often by Mamoru Oshii. These reflections again drive home the point of questioning your own identity. Monoto looks at her reflection and thinks about what she sees. Is she looking at a living being or is she looking at a machine? Like 'Blade Runner', 'Ghost in the Shell' also explores the idea of life and what it means to be alive. 'The Puppet Master' after he arrives also questions the right of his creators to undermine him by calling him a programme containing a set of information. He argues that the DNA in the human body consists of nothing but information too, which makes them not too different from cyborgs or other forms of artificial intelligence.The themes in the plot can be interpreted in various ways. In a literal sense, the film shows a cyborg trying to find herself in a dark and menacing world. She questions herself. She wants to become something more than just a tool for the government. I see it as a metaphor for female struggle in our world. A woman always gets labelled and is expected to carry out specific duties and obligations and very few women all around the world truly have the opportunity to live the life that they want to live and pursue their own dreams. Men suffer due to similar pressures too, but maybe not as much as women do. The film ends optimistically. The character of 'The Puppet Master' is used as a god-like figure that gives Monoto the strength to become more powerful. She starts her life again both figuratively as well as literally with a new body which is of a young girl. This might well be an optimistic note to end on by using a new cyborg body that symbolises a female representing the next generation who is powerful and confident about herself.The script is good when it comes to the themes it conveys. When it comes to the plot in a literal sense, it is maybe a bit predictable and you can certainly see the influence of William Gibson's 'Neuromancer'. It is directed very well and the film looks gorgeous. Every still is ornamented by spectacular and awe-inspiring artwork with intricate details. 'Ghost in the Shell' is a very intelligent piece of work. It is thought provoking and I believe requires multiple viewings and introspective discussions. It not only is a great anime film, but also a great film period and deserves its place in the category of other masterful Sci-fi films like '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Blade Runner', 'Gravity' etc. that evokes emotions and intriguing questions about the society as well as the individual.",Ghost in the Shell
53,LivingDog,Excellent,10,27 March 2005,"Japanese story as one of its best. Emotional intelligent maudling yet not depressing. The animation for its time (1995) is excellent as well. (Today we have computer animation which cannot be imitated by the finest pen and pencil 2D animator.) But as always it is the story which matters and not the technique. But this story is action packed with a well rounded story that has plot twists which enhance and do not detract. (I've seen ""Aeon Flux"" and ""Spawn"" (the unedited animation) and ""GITS"" is the best - hands down.

An extremely complex and difficult to understand script, at least at the beginning, it is necessary to sit in front of the TV and not blink a second, even short, we have a reasonable development of the characters, and outcomes that cause pure passion to the viewer and a sense of admiration to history and climate of the film. This climate is pure responsibility of the photography of the film, with an extremely dark, rainy color palette that creates a climate in the best style ""Blade Runner"", is a future that although it is Cyber ​​ Punk, it is not yet lost or depressed , he is still in the process of deconstruction and loss of values, we can not fail to mention the gore and violence that is used only when necessary, and in this perhaps the film leaves the chance to ally the shock of the plot with a shock in the graphic, but on the other hand the concept of allying nudity to invisibility is new and very interesting, and is extremely beautiful on screen, the film has an animation only ""Ok"", resisting today it is impossible not to realize how the same is Dated, at least in terms of animation. The quest to humanize the machine is not something new, but it's always interesting, and ""Gosth In The Shell"" is no different, one of the icons of Eastern pop culture, it's still a great film that brings extremely punctual reflections in a cliché way, and with much charm and elegance.",Ghost in the Shell
55,tankace,My Personal Favorite Anime Movie!,9,26 September 2016,"Ghost in the Shell is one of the most influential anime movies and even non animated films have taken inspiration from it with Matrix been the most well known imitator. What amazes me with that film apart from the great detail in the animation, the story and the mix between cop and science fiction ,is the philosophy in the film ,which focuses to what makes your personality real.This fits perfectly with the story, in which we follow a cyborg policewoman and her team in their latest operations to find the Puppet Master, a master hacker ,who is as elusive as an eel and the computer skills which has, are in a level of their own. Now you are thinking, OK this person is the guru of all the hackers, so what? Well, in this future robotics and computer science have advance so much that is common practice for people to add on them artificial components and download their mind in robotic bodies and this bodies are so realistic, that is close to impossible to distinguish them from the regular Joe. And here is the issue with this hacker. He or She (No spoilers here) has such a skill set that he can hack the people with artificial bodies in order to do the dirty job and this has as the result the persons memories to change and he or she isn't even known it. In short this cat can mess with someone's identity and the poor fellow can't even remember what he or she was before. So then what makes them more human the our cyborg ,who speaks, socializes and has genuine existential talks about if she is real.As she said herself "" There are countless ingredients that make up the human body and mind, like all the components that make up me as an individual with my own personality. Sure I have a face and voice to distinguish myself from others, but my thoughts and memories are unique only to me, and I carry a sense of my own destiny. Each of those things are just a small part of it. I collect information to use in my own way. All of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience. I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries"". In short she maybe artificial in structure, but the rest of her characteristics are hers alone. So can you say ""she is a machine, just program and 0 and 1, the real humans have real emotions and personalities""? Really with a hacker like the Puppet Master you may have to rethink that. Over all for any sci-fi fan is a must watch, don't show it to your kids it isn't for them at all and of course with the modern-day technology advancing so quickly this two decades old film, maybe a great warning for the dangers of robotics going to far.",Ghost in the Shell

58,renegadeviking-271-528568,Ghost in the Shell,8,25 January 2020,"In the summer of 2003, I picked up a magazine from a local newsagents'. This magazine (since loaned to a friend and therefore lost) introduced this crow to the works of Hideshi Hino, the recently-released Oldboy, and Ghost in the Shell (a promo for the English release of Innocence graced the cover, and it contained a review of said movie). One could say that the magazine represented a significant turning point in my life.Some weeks later, I came across an episode of Stand Alone Complex on the telly. So, I started following the show. And once I'd caught up via the magic of re-runs, I was hooked.I immediately went looking for what other things Ghost in the Shell there were to be found. At the time, there were two feature-length animated movies, three manga collections, and the anime series - all of which belonged to different fictional universes, mind you, but more on that later. And oh, how long I've wanted to talk about the franchise.Recently, with trailers dropping for the upcoming Hollywood live-action movie, I've been meaning to do an analysis on everything Ghost in the Shell; however, no matter where I start, the road gets rocky. So - this crow thought - why not go back to the beginning and build from there?Leading up to the release of the live-action movie (which I intend to thoroughly preview), The Corvid Review will do a complete breakdown of the series.And we're going to start with the first movie as our access point. After all, it recently became 21 years old, and I'm a bit ashamed I never managed to do this in time for the anniversary.For now, I'll keep things light, but as these posts start to pile up, I'll start analysing and interpreting the many facets to this franchise.So, let's not wait around any longer. My ghost, it whispers to me. Let's dive in.Ghost in the Shell opens with a meeting between Section 6 chief Nakamura and an American diplomat who has been working to help a programmer defect from Japan. Major Motoko Kusanagi stands above the building they are in, listening to their conversation. When the diplomat, faced with charges, claims immunity, she takes off her overcoat and drops off the roof.On the way down, she assassinates the diplomat and turns invisible (a future projection of therm-optic camouflage) as the security detail and SWAT team equivalent look on in disbelief.
Most people miss the importance of this scene. This isn't just showing off how much of a badass the Major is (this is just not the sort of woman you want to cross), but it's a small plot detail that I recommend paying attention to.From here, we segue into the ""making of cyborg"" sequence (otherwise known as the ""shelling"" sequence). Set to an orchestral backdrop conducted by the master Kenji Kawai (who himself plays some of the drums on occasion), we get to see the creation of Major Motoko Kusanagi.In the world of Ghost in the Shell, technology has advanced far enough that prosthetic body parts and organs are commonplace, and the net is far more interlaced with our physical reality than we can even think about today.The Major is a full-body cyborg. The only ""original organic"" parts of her are her brain, and possibly some pieces of spinal column.Following the ""making of cyborg"" scene, the Major wakes up in her apartment (a scene that has since become one of the many iconic scenes of the movie over time).Throughout the movie, we see Kusanagi wandering. First, she takes a journey across the very Hong Kong-inspired Tokyo of 2029; and later, we see her diving in the ocean. These are both beautiful scenes (especially the first), but I'll get to their relevance later on in this post.During this time, Section 9 (the public security outfit the Major works for) is hot on the heels of a master-hacker known only as the ""Puppetmaster"". In the world of Ghost in the Shell, technology and society have become so interconnected that you can literally ""ghost-hack"" people. And so, all Section 9 have come up with so far are proxies being played to some ulterior motive or the other.As the investigation continues, and Section 9 comes upon dead end following dead end, a mangled female body is brought to Section 9. A few hours ago, a prosthetic body factory was hacked, and the body was put together autonomously. After exiting the factory, the body was run over by a truck.Section 9 discovers that there seems to be a human ""ghost"" inside the ""shell"" (see what went on there? See it?). Section 6 shows up, and it is uncovered that the ""ghost"" inside the body is the Puppetmaster itself (or himself, as some of the characters gender it). The Puppetmaster is the product of one Project 2501, a venture masterminded by Section 6 to create a system which can ""ghost-hack"" people and use them as proxies for espionage (and to otherwise act in Section 6's interests), despite Section 6's initial claims of Project 2501 being built to capture the ""elusive"" Puppetmaster.During its ventures on the net, a part of Project 2501 gained a ""ghost"" (i.e.: became self-aware), and has since formed its own goals. Section 6 and other involved parties, have since been trying to trap the Puppetmaster, fearing the consequences of a rogue machine consciousness. And they've finally succeeded, by luring it down to a single body. Since Section 9 usually handles the ""dirty work"", they've been made part of the process as well.Section 6, however, raids Section 9 and makes off with the Puppetmaster. Section 9 gives chase, and it ends in a scene where the Major squares off, one-on-one, with a tank.Following the battle sequence, in which Batou arrives to provide a much-needed assist, the Major and the Puppetmaster have a conversation.The Puppetmaster is frustrated with its status as the 'Other'. Unique as it is (superior, even), its immortality and its inability to reproduce make it feel an outcast, and so, it has used those very inadequacies to give itself a purpose.And it's purpose? To seek out someone who can be the bridge between it and humanity. And the perfect bridge, it has found in Motoko Kusanagi, since she is like it - only from the human side of things.
During the movie, the Major's disconnection with the world has been driven home. The scenes highlighting this are the ""wandering"" scene and the ""diving"" scene. Even Batou - the closest person she has both in terms of cyberisation and friendship - is far, far more human than her. Kusanagi simply doesn't feel human enough. All that makes her human is others' treatment of her as one.Batou tries to stop the ""dive"" (the interlink between them), but is hacked by the Puppetmaster. The two stare into each other's ghosts awhile, and just then, Section 6's snipers blow their heads (literally, in the case of Kusanagi, despite Batou's attempt to save her) off.At the very end, Kusanagi wakes up in a child's body, which is the best Batou could do at short-notice from the black market. She reveals to him that while she is now something new - a new consciousness born of the merger between her and the Puppetmaster, but who is neither of them.She decides to leave alone, and Batou reminds her he'll always be around if she needs him.She stands at the edge of a hill by Batou's safehouse. Contemplating what comes next, she stares out across the vista and says:""The net is vast and infinite.""SOME OF THE GHOSTSIn this section, we'll be taking a quick look at the craft of the movie, as well as touch on the concepts it deals with.CRAFTGhost in the Shell is a marvellously made movie, and while some might prefer the ""updated"" CGI-aided Ghost in the Shell 2.0 remake, I think the original is vastly superior. After having watched so much Ghost in the Shell over the years, every time I rewatch the ""making of cyborg"" sequence, I'm surprised to how quick things move. It's perfectly paced, but something about the scene - the visuals, the music, everything - puts me in mind of a much slower pace.The art is stunning, and the few minutes that we spend wandering around the city with the Major are a stunning achievement. Pictured above is a similar scene, but from a different point in the the movie. The above is the location from which Batou and Ishikawa start narrowing down one of the proxies' locations while relaying information between Section 9 Chief Aramaki, and the Major and Togusa, who are also on the move.The detail put into the scenes is amazing, and the way in which the ""camera"" glides through the city makes for one long spectacle.And the music of the movie, oh my dear ghost! Is it ever lush. The soundtrack drips with strings and chimes that line up perfectly with the visuals. Better soundtracks are rare to come by. Just sitting and listening to it with your eyes closed puts you in exactly the frame of mind that the movie conveys.THEMESGhost in the Shell involves far too many concepts for me to talk about all at once in this post. I'd have to turn my iek mode onsniff-sniff! and yammer on for hours, arguing this and that (and possibly drop a ""dirbty joke!"" for good measure); but I promised I'd touch on all those things at some other date. For now, I'll just list some of the major points the movie raises out:What makes one human is the primary question running throughout the movie. It's explored by both Kusanagi and the Puppetmaster, as well as by Batou, Togusa, and others. Now that you have a general idea of what happens in the movie, you can probably guess to what ends this question leads and how.The most significant supporting themes are replication and mirroring, variety, identities in posthuman environments, virtual memories, real memories, and emergence (I'm going to leave this term on this loose note). Ghost in the Shell has its own answers to some of the questions the concepts raise, and briefly argues the others as and when they come, but we don't live in its universe. So, the movie closes its own loops where it can, but we're left with the prospect that in the future",Ghost in the Shell

The urban backgrounds are beautifully rendered, and I think that they had a long lasting influence in our visual culture, even 25 years later.
The story is just ok. The themes about identity, existence and humanity are a bit forced and underdeveloped, but whatever.

It's fundamentally about artificial intelligence and how human can be an individual that is mostly synthetic. At slightly over 80 minutes the movie is rather short and the story is rather simple, more of a short philosophical comment on what means to be human and life form, not a simple machine.The film follows a cyborg, major Kusanagi, which works for the police to track down an international criminal, which is initially though to be an American hacker but soon it is revealed to be something entirely different.

61,Darkjak007,What truly defines Humanity,9,14 November 2021,"One of the most iconic anime of all time Ghost in shell was directed by Mamoru Oshii and adapted from the manga by Masamune Shirow. In a world where most humans have become equipped with cybernetic enhancements and even cyberbrains that allow access to networks. We follows the story of Makoto Kusanagi Major of section 9 a division that deals with cybersecurity and counterterrorism. Their most daring case to come arrives in the form of the puppet master, a hacker with the ability to takes control/Alter the body(Shells) and minds(Ghost). Being used without any recollection whatsoever and over the coarse of the film Makoto struggles with concept of want is life true about. Ghost in the shell has been praised to death if your an anime fan it's impossible to not have heard of it. Either this movie or the sequel, The live action, manga or the various show spin-offs. It was an international sensation it help further bring the genre into the mainstream of the west, and not only change The perspective anime, but also animation as a whole. Animation for the longest time was always belittle and seen nothing more as children content not to be taken serious, not seen as real art. Ghost in the shell philosophical themes on reality and where does the line draw with the concept of humility's Existence. Does humanity have a limit? Do your memory and thought really define you? Can they be trusted, and if they can't where does that leave you as a lifeform? Questions like those the movie makes you think on. This sort of Dystopian world where so much of humanities reached a point where it can combine with machines, can connect to various networks hack networks, enhance the body even make replicants shells . Does life take on other forms? Though even with the films themes the movie still bask in it artistic style from it's city to the design of machinery, it gives off a style that alway seems probable it never seem to otherworldly from our world. The shot of the slums over the chorus Buddhist chant adds this scope of complexity. The scene where Makoto rises from the water and she looks at the sky nothing is said at all it's just done through visuals and interpretation. When her and batou are on the boat talking about how much of them is still them it's more or less the turn point of the theme of the movie because Makoto starts to feel conflicted about her existence, while. Around more 50/50 he more confident in who he is, but still understand where the majors coming from. It also also offers a perfect mix between drama and action those action is fast pace energetics and violent in some instances it doesn't overshadow the overall concept of what the film is trying to accomplish. The film's overall a masterpiece it something that entices you though also it doesn't come off as just all film to just watch. It does leave you thinking on some of the concepts and as a film that is worth multiple viewings to analyze not only the dialogue, but the tones and setting of the characters of how they all fit in this new world.

Because that's honestly what I thought.I might also suggest that maybe this was because I watched the English dub because I couldn't find a subbed version, and good bloody god is the English voice acting dreadful at times. So maybe I wouldn't have been as harsh on the narrative if this wasn't the case, but even then, it wouldn't have made it any better. I just wouldn't have noticed it as much.But for the most part, over the course of this film's way too short runtime, the majority of it is police investigation/anime martial arts, and occasionally, the characters stop to have a little natter about what it means to be human, or at what point technology has gone too far, and christ the dialogue in those scenes is clunky and spits the themes right into your face.It's only at the very end of the film that I feel it does something different to Blade Runner, and I do mean the very end. Like, the last five minutes.But this could all be different if I watched the subbed version. I don't know, but I'm sure the voice acting will at least be better.But I certainly didn't hate it. Even if I didn't think much of the story, it's not exactly bad, just not very original in my opinion. It's directed pretty well, the animation is amazing, especially for the time, the soundtrack is great, and the characters are...okay. They have solid personalities, at least.Soooooo...I don't know.

69,TheOny13,Apparently this is what good entertainment was back in those days...,4,25 September 2019,"Soo many people have praised this movie for being a masterpiece and an inspirational movie for so many other movies that I gave it a shot to see what's so special about. And I was terribly disappointed and bored by this movie and I will rant now and try to deconstruct everything people praise about this movie:1. Philosophical deepness; while there ar a couple scenes in the movie in which a character explains or at least tries to explain some differences between humans and robots they come like vague throw-ins because the rest of the movie never builds toward that, these moments never feel earned or like the movie was always going there. The are just thrown in, in a rather convoluded mess of a movie.
2. Conflicted character: while that may be true in some way, the female main character (whose name I don't even remembered or at least I don't even remember hearing it in the movie) is very poorly developed. You don't know who she is, what she is and why she is this way, or at least I never noticed how she became what she became. So by the end I didn't give a cent about her story and how it all turns out in the end. She sometimes says things that maybe could hint at her conflict between her human side and her robotic side but she is never developed as a character and that's mainly due to the script in which I'll into in a second.
3. The story: man this script is a total and gigantic mess. I didn't understand a thing in this movie. Sure it was all fun when the story went to the piu, piu moments (action scenes) but aside from that there is no world building, I never understood where the story takes place, why should I be invested, who are the characters and why should I care about them. This movie has no plot! It even seems at time just like a patch from different scenes thrown in together without much connection between them. So by the end I didn't give a cent about the ""Puppet Master"" or about the female character or whatever they were trying to achieve.On short this movie is garbage... there are only 3 good moments in the whole movie and those are some interesting dialogue or monologue involving the ""Puppet Master"" and two other action scenes, but when the story is so convoluded and these moments don't feel like they were being builded up towards they seem like shallow attempts at making a great movie with philosophical concepts.

Anyway, it was on the other day so I thought I'd give it a viewing - man, was that a waste of time!I can understand why some users would say that The Matrix ""ripped this off"", and if indeed, it did, it at least did so a million times better. What was wrong with this feature was that the dialogue was so damn awful! The dubbing - spoken as if everyone were a robot - added to the pain tenfold and, with so much dialogue going on to try to explain the plot and universe it all takes place in, it all soon becomes pretty unbearable.I actually turned over not long after the lead character explained why she likes to go diving even though her body is built to sink - they couldn't get drunk because their bodies breaks down the alcohol before it can affect them, but listening to their mindless spiel left me punch-drunk in the corner, reaching desperately for the controller.Verdict: dull, massively over-rated and untenably so.",Ghost in the Shell

72,robotbling,Darker and grittier than the Comic,8,12 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell, a sci-fi manga originally published back in 1989, was the inspiration behind the 1995 anime film directed by Mamoru Oshii. He and his Patlabor alumni take the Gibson-esque cyberpunk aspects of the setting they enjoyed most, ditching the humor and much of the character of the graphic novel. Interestingly, Shirow's first experimentation with digital media was mirrored by that of the film's production, which utilized what were at that time revolutionary digital visual effects. The result is a stark, more realistic vision of the future than that presented by Shirow, but one still over-run by problems emerging from society's new interconnectedness with technology.What could be called the internet 3.0 is ubiquitous. The main character, Major Motoko Kusanagi of Public Security Section 9, is a cyborg who's body is on loan from the government. She connects to the network through wires in her spinal cord, accessing information directly with her consciousness – her ghost. Like a computer program, ghosts can be hacked turning otherwise normal or modified humans into walking puppets. Simulated experiences - implanted false memories for example – are used as a template to control whole patterns of behavior so a hacker need not take direct control. The story centers around the exploits of an enigmatic hacker pulling strings on a multinational scale known only as the Puppet Master who may or may not be human.GITS-001 The film made an impact when it was released, not unlike that of Akira when it hit the international film circuit. It's a difficult science fiction film of the sort Hollywood cannot make: dense without explanation; and much too hard to follow for the average movie-goer. For those well-versed in cyberpunk lore there isn't anything too new or groundbreaking. It's the excellent art direction based on the gritty, overcrowded streets of Hong Kong and Kenji Kawai's haunting musical score that lifted this above the typical cyberpunk fare, putting to shame its contemporaries like Johnny Mnemonic. It so redefined the cyberpunk aesthetic that many consider it the primary source of inspiration for the Wachowski Brother's sci-fi blockbuster The Matrix (an assertion with which I'm inclined to agree).There can be no question that Ghost in the Shell is an important film, a kind of spiritual successor to Blade Runner, which thankfully stands apart from Shirow's graphic novel. The two are quite different, and can be enjoyed for their own quirks and qualities. Unfortunately, there is a GITS 2.0 (renewal) version of the film made to take advantage of advances in CGI. Scenes from the original have been altered or outright replaced with computer graphics. As a fan of the original film, I see this renewal as completely unnecessary.",Ghost in the Shell
73,toqtaqiya2,Has a pace that makes even the most pulse-pounding action scenes seem dreamlike.,9,22 August 2010,"Ghost In The Shell is unquestionably one of the best anime ever. It's notable for being the first anime to incorporate computer animation, thus it's also a milestone in animation. Much has been said about its look. The visuals are awe-inspiring. There are abundant details, making just about every scene worthwhile. New Port City, with its futuristic capitalism, is a well-designed combination of advanced technology and urban decay. For science-fiction, and especially for cyberpunk, fans the story will be a treat. Others may find it complicated. But the complexity only makes the story more serious, more realistic. The music score fits the film perfectly. Composed by Kenji Kawai, it was influenced by old Japanese folk music. I'm actually not a fan of director Mamoru Oshii's work, but Ghost In The Shell is certainly an admirable effort. This is his best film, and it will probably remain his best. It will be understood and enjoyed more by adults. Most anime fans are teenagers. Some of them will find the film less interesting than it actually is. While it is very much a Japanese film it still has mass appeal for non-Japanese audiences. Its ideas and its look have been influential, reaching even Hollywood.

80,blazesnakes9,Anime does it again,7,9 November 2013,"Japanese animation has been known on the eastern side of our world, where the film-makers and animators put in all of their ideas and create enough to move the story along. The first anime have ever made an breakthrough was in 1988. That year, an science-fiction action animation called Akira was released in Japan, bringing in a lot of money there, but not here in America. Ghost in the Shell, an anime film that was released in 1996, tries to do the same thing. The movie takes place in the futuristic year of 2029, where the world has becomes interconnected by a vast electronic network which permeates every aspect of life. An assault team leader is assigned to track down an hacker called the ""Puppet Master"". When a facility is hacked and is programmed to assemble a female cyborg, the cyborg becomes entirely programmed and escapes from the facility. The team soon investigate the robot after it is hit by a truck and realize something. Inside the robot, there is a human ghost, possibly the ""Puppet Master"" that the team is trying to capture. One of them goes into the robot and soon finds out that there's more than a ghost living inside this cyborg. Ghost in the Shell is probably going to be described as another anime science-fiction film like Akira. But, that is where I beg to differ. The difference between this film and Akira is that Akira was more based on the characters and the setting that they live in. Here, the characters aren't living in a world of chaos, but the story dwells on the plot of what the ghost in the shell really does to people. The technology behind the robot is very interesting to see and it does it best to tells us a lot about the robot. But, what lacks in Ghost in the Shell is the energy. That is why the movie isn't up there with Akira. When I reviewed Akira, I thought that the action in that movie really worked and to a degree, you can make a solid anime film with a lot of special effects and a lot of intriguing ideas that can take over the movie itself. In Akira, the energy never slows down. In Ghost in the Shell however, the energy isn't up to beat. Sometimes, I thought the energy really drags and eventually slows the movie down. That doesn't mean it's all bad. What fascinates me is that the science-fiction behind the story stuck out to me. There are a lot of technical aspects that the movie focuses on. In the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell, I was reminded of a movie that came out 4 years later after this one. That movie was The Matrix. In comparison, both The Matrix and Ghost in the Shell focuses on the characters and the technology that affects them. Another film that also did the same was 2001: A Space Odyssey. I like what Ghost in the Shell did for the science and the futuristic setting of the story, but I really wanted more energy and more action sequences that pushes the story along. That's why Akira was a much more better movie than Ghost in the Shell. It's not a bad anime movie. It just doesn't match with a great anime film. Nevertheless, the movie does work and does deliver the science-fiction story at its best. ★★★ 3 stars.",Ghost in the Shell
81,MattBirk,Great Animation but a Predictable Story,6,15 March 2016,"Ghost in the Shell is one of those movies that I really wanted to like more than I actually did. While I enjoyed to animation (greatly detailed and knowing no bounds but the illustrators imagination), the story itself was a bit too predictable for me. Normally that's not always a bad thing, but this story seemed to rely very heavy on the reveal of the villain and his motives (both of which I saw coming a mile away, unfortunately). But leading up to the revelation there were some interesting ideas floating around about the mind/soul of a human being. What makes us human? Do people really care about their 'souls'?That being said, my biggest gripe with Ghost in the Shell had to be the Puppet Master itself. I knew exactly 'who' it was and what his goals would be. It felt way too familiar from a cyber-heavy-narrative standpoint (but the big thing is the movie was released in 1995, so the ideas were a bit more original back then). Both how he came to be and what he wanted felt all too familiar. Again, that might be a bit unfair to say when watching this two decades after its release but the fact still remains. But if you can get past this aspect of the story, there is a lot to like.The action scenes are great, particularly the ending scene involving the spider-tank. A quick burst of action followed by a few shots of the rain falling down on their tiny battlefield really created a unique, tranquil feeling. There is something eerie yet poignant about the scene. Also, the idea of 'ghost-hacking' and the camouflage are two very interesting ideas that gave Ghost in the Shell some more memorable moments (it'll be interesting to see how the live-action version handles the camouflage idea).You can easily see the importance the movie played in the science-fiction genre, specifically involving The Matrix or any movie involving cyber-science vs the human soul. Had I seen this movie years ago, I'm sure it would have been a more enjoyable experience, but the story seemed too played out for me. And as for the age-old question that gets asked (not really that old, but often brought up), which is better Akira or Ghost in the Shell? I'm definitely team Akira.",Ghost in the Shell
82,unclesamsavage,A Powerful Application of Descartes' Timeless Philosophy,9,8 September 2019,"After a discussion on Descartes' 'Meditations on the First Philosophy', I sought out this anime film that I have long heard praised. The story is a bit of patchwork, assembling exposure to a futuristic Asia and the story of government agent Major Motoko Kusanagi. We follow her and this world through a sinister plot by a consciousness called the Puppet Master, lost in cyberspace, to uproot society. The animation here is gorgeous, some of the best world-building shots I have seen outside Studio Ghibli. I watched the original Japanese version with subtitles and found no problems with the voice acting though I have read others' complaints about the English dub. From a production standpoint, the film is outstanding.Yet, what I found most compelling is the philosophical undertones throughout the movie. The separation of mind and body is something Descartes seeks to flesh out in his 'Meditations' ultimately to try and find the essence of humanity. Some people will call that one's soul or spirit or man, but I suppose writer Shirow Masamune would call that one's ghost. Perhaps we all are just consciences occupying human forms or maybe identity is self-constructed. If you are curious about any of these points, this movie will help you navigate the weeds of the discussion and hopefully make you more informed. This has instantly become one of my favorite animes and will surely continue to be relevant for decades to come. A future such as this one may soon be approaching.",Ghost in the Shell
83,Criticman12,The anime film that inspired filmmakers.,10,5 February 2011,"Like, ""Akira"", that movie did have an influence on filmmakers. But the film that had an influence on sci-fi filmmakers was the 1995 anime film, ""Ghost in the Shell"".The story is about a female cyborg and her sidekick trying to track down a hacker known as the puppet master.The story is great, the animation is great, the action scene's were pretty cool, and what make's this movie interesting is that almost every citizen in this movie is a cyborg.Overall, ""Ghost in the shell"", is an anime masterpiece that is definitely worth watching.",Ghost in the Shell
84,DonaldDooD,Interesting Themes Mean Nothing Without Proper Execution,3,20 July 2014,"Ghost in the Shell seems to be as lucky as Blade Runner and Akira, blindsiding its audience with novelty and a false sense of depth. Its one of those films where people love to talk what its ""about"", but have little to say on how it portrays its themes. They say its ""about"" conscious, identity, and our dim future...but why should we care?For me, a film must have strong characters to anchor you to the story. They must be realistic and relateable, so you can understand and emphasize with their experiences. But to call GitS's characters two-dimensional is stretching the definition. The story is so focused on the case, we rarely spend any time with the cast, and thus I couldn't care about their interactions or fate. The main character is especially uninteresting: when she supposedly undergoes a great change at the end of the film, she's just as wooden as before.The sacrifice of character isn't even worth the sci-fi, cyber mystery thrills. The plot is so bloated with techno-babel its almost incomprehensible. This isn't depth that requires multiple viewings to understand - this is just bad writing. With little emotion attached to the scenes, I barely maintained attention. Only a few action scenes are scattered through the film, and none are worth the wait.I will concede the animation is pretty good, especially the backgrounds. They're cartoons, but dark, detailed, and realistic. You get a decent sense of this advanced, yet dismal world. If only this quality were in a better film! Its easy to deride those against this film as people who ""just don't get it"". I'd say there's nothing important to take away. Its world is barely explored outside of the premise, and the lone conflict between the main character and villain is so bizarre it has no bearing to reality. Imagination and presentation does not equal depth. Ghost in the Shell felt like it needed another 30 minutes to explain things and develop its themes and characters. Its easily one of the worst films I have watched in terms of writing, but at least it looks good, and is a short burn. With the large amount of sci-fi we have access to these days, I wouldn't recommend GitS to anyone.",Ghost in the Shell
85,Adele666,A Great Futuristic Film,8,12 April 2020,"Ghost in a Shell is ,vaguely, about where the future is heading and how easy it is to control people.It does a great job of explaining the basics of the futuristic technology and it visuals are stunning.The Dialogue is very thought provoking and you will be very interested in their conversations.It is a great film that is calming and action packed - go watch it!",Ghost in the Shell
86,MrVibrating,Pretty much spectacular,9,15 January 2007,"Ghost in the Shell is a cinematic gem of considerable carat. Blending over-the-top action, fantastic imagery, thought-provoking philosophy and suspense is not easy, but it seems Japanese animation is quite good at it. I imagine pitching this would have been hard in the west.As cool as Ghost in the Shell is with it's many gadgets, gunfights and futuristic settings, it is actually an almost talky(the right amount and level, thankfully) philosophic exploration. Individuality, memory, personality, intelligence and the definition of life are some of the issues the film discusses, without giving a definite verdict on any of them. Not even the supposed villain of the movie is singled out as the source of all evil, which happens all too often in movies.There is a good amount of action and a complex plot to rush your drifting mind, however. For example, the ""weapon design"" credit was an early one, and there's a lot of futuristic hardware and technology used on screen. The people of Ghost in the Shell are technophiles, no doubt about it, and some take it to almost absurd levels. Ironically, it's also all the tech that makes them so insecure and thoughtful.Then, at point, the movie takes time to be just beautiful. The never-named city(we can assume it's Tokyo or neo-Tokyo, it always is) is a contrasted entity, mysterious and great to behold. Scenes with the rain, people in the streets, and a hauntingly beautiful score are probably the best parts of the entire movie.Keep in mind, that this is probably not the best movie to watch lazily. Although it's action, it's far from van Damme, and you have to make an effort to keep up with the plot and the philosophy. Another tip: Try to watch it subbed. Dubbing takes away a lot of the wonder of unfamiliarity. Oh, and it usually sucks.A side-note: Try to count the things the Wachovski brothers borrowed for the Matrix!",Ghost in the Shell

People of the future with robotic enhancements. Cyborgs. With all the automation going on why not? Some people are full on robots and they are vulnerable to being hacked by this unknown person or consciousness. Anyway it is abstract and there is little combat action compared to any other action film but it is more realistic that way. That being said there is some intense action in the beginning otherwise it is kind of a slow but with beautiful visuals.",Ghost in the Shell
90,jake-179,Inspiration for THE MATRIX?,6,4 March 2002,"I don't normally get in to ""anime,"" but this movie was pretty entertaining. The animation is this movie is some of the best I have seen.  Not only is the artwork fantastically done, the movement of the characters is very realistic.  It almost looks like they rotoscoped some scenes, although I doubt they did that.  The plot, as you might expect, is a little thin and takes a while to develop fully.  But there is a good amount of action and violence.  At the beginning of the movie, a guy gets shot in the head and pretty much his entire upper half unzips like a water balloon hitting a windshield, exposing internal organs, a shattered spine, and plenty of blood in gooey detail.  The guns are extremely cool in this movie, and some are depicted with shocking destructive power, which I thought was really neat. Not to mention, you get to see some really sexy cyborgs, who have to take all their clothes off and fight naked all the time.  Thats always a bonus in my book.I rented this movie because I had heard that some of it had inspired the making of THE MATRIX.  I was surprised at just how much similarity I found. The green, full screen numbers of computer code are there.  The idea of existing inside an internet world controled by computer.  People logging in to the computer world with electrodes in the backs of their necks.  The silent, ominous ""agents"" with their powerful guns and sun glasses.  People with super-human abilities, jumping impossible distances and cracking the concrete they land on.  And of course, the entire concept of debating our own existence.  I have no idea just exactly how much inspiration the Wachowski brothers took from this movie, but there are certainly plenty of similarities.  However, there is also a lot of differences.  Enough that if you are a fan of THE MATRIX, you will definitely enjoy watching this movie.And, if nothing else, you get to see a very well drawn, anatomically captivating cyborg chick run around naked.Major complaints:  Some of the writing was very soap opera-esque.  (In other words, the plot is explained to the audience in very obvious dialogue which is not well written.)High point aside from the naked chicks:  The battle at the end with that super cool Spider/Tank thing.  When that thing was shredding the concrete pillars that the cyborg chick was hiding behind, that was really cool.One other similarity I noticed is, I watched the version with the English over dubbing, and by coincidence or not, the voice of the mysterious Ghost/Hacker character that is a lot like Morpheus in THE MATRIX, even sounded like Lawerence Fishburn.Too bad the plot was a little muddy.  I don't know why those anime movies always have problems with their plots.  Seems like the writers are trying too hard to make things complicated.",Ghost in the Shell

I'll be honest here, I'm not a big anime fan but there have been some
I like. My first time seeing Ghost in the Shell was when I ordered it through the
library back in July, and ever since kept re-checking it out.
I just can't get enough of it, I love it.
The characters are cool, Major Motoko Kusinagi is my favorite out of
the characters she is very,very sexy and cool. When I first seen
her birth sequence in the opening credits I was like this is cool,
I love how they show off her sexy naked body in a beautiful way.Batou is my second favorite, he is cyber-inhanced and second in charge
of the anti-terrorist unit of section 9.I'm getting off point here, but Section 9 must stop some kind of
computer entity from hacking and controlling government property.
I don't want to say more with out ruining anything but I hope you get to see
this I just love.Overall a cool little film that is made for adults with mind teasing
philosophic questions and cool action scenes.

93,mighty_pickman,A true classic,9,23 July 2003,"A true classic.  Set the bar in quality animation back in 1995 & to this day few is any films have matched it.Many films that try to merge traditional 2-D animation with CGI find that the two don't sit comfortably but in Ghost in the Shell, 2-D & CGI come together very nicely. why? CGI still struggles with fluid human & animal movement, so it was good that in Ghost that the CGI was left to the backgrounds & solid objects & the human/cyborg characters are left to 2-D.The musical score is easily the best yet seen in anime & one of favourites of all time.Plot could have been expanded upon, only going approximately 82 minutes, running time was not an issue.",Ghost in the Shell
94,Jeremy Bristol,"Great examination of what it is to be human, but minus emotions.",7,1 June 2001,"Ghost has some of the best animation I've ever seen, and the character designs really fit the story better than the usual big-eyed beautiful girls that typically are found in anime (Akira excepted).  Unlike most animation, the scenes where computer animation is blended with cel look right (was anyone really impressed with the magic carpet ride in Aladdin?).Also, it is very thought provoking and philosophical, even quoting from the bible (the ""through a glass, darkly"" bit, also used in a film by Ingmar Bergman).  However, it doesn't have much emotional punch unless you're one of those people who thought The Matrix wasn't just possible but likely. Even liberals are far too conservative and unwilling for change to feel comfortable with having whole parts of their body replaced to become superhuman (there are already a lot of paranoid people at my college worried about how the government will use the human genome project to control their lives or clone them, despite the fact that there won't be any major advancements for many years).  The views of individuality are a bit strange, too.  Basically, the movie says that we are who we are because of the information stored in our minds, but gives no creedence to the individual ways people process that information (look at autistics).  Think of it this way: a robot can have all the information a human can, but when given a choice between equally good things (such as which kind of ice cream to have or which of the seven urinals to use in an empty bathroom), it would prove itself incapable of this simple human trait.  Sure, the movie understands that (a ""ghost"" in this movie is a soul-like entity), but it doesn't really ""show"" this--the human and partially-human characters feel as unemotional as the computers around them.  Still, that's traditional in science fiction--in the Blade Runner director's cut, the replicants (especially Roy Batty) seem more human than Harrison Ford's character.7/10 for the subtitled version.The dubbed version is another story.  This is absolutely the worst high-budget dub there is--practically on par with the Skuld episodes from Oh My Goddess (""We've--got--to--help--Belldandy!"" with very hard and pronounced iambs).  On top of that, the sound is so flatly recorded and mixed that you can't understand what's thought and what's spoken (which is very important in this movie).  1/10.",Ghost in the Shell

96,maxastree,"Sophomoric, derivative, conceptual",6,2 January 2017,"This film is not cool, so if you think ""cool"" is cool, this is not the picture for you.The film appeals to a certain fantasist mindset shared by 19 year olds that think that mouthing unwieldy bits of dialogue about politics, science and philosophy = great writing. In the future, allegedly, advanced cybernetic humans are involved with counter-terrorism, and they have their own security issues because evil computer hackers can break into their own brains. A lot of large (ripped off) scenes from Bladerunner scroll by in Anime style also, amid the shoot outs and tension-less action sequences.Some nudity also, and bits of ""adult"" political banter. The film doesn't seem to match tone to soundtrack well, and there is zero relatable human drama anywhere in the picture. The combination of sci-fi pretense, earnestness and complete fantasy make the film intriguing, but not welcoming at all. I'm aware, also, that film reviewers call the film a ""masterpiece"" regularly. Here's the thing though - the criteria that drives positive reviews from mainstream media is not always accurate. In my opinion, the critically panned Japanese offbeat comedy Funky Forest: First Contact is a hundred times more entertaining that G.I.T.S, which is really just a tech-heavy, soulless Bladerunner wannabe at heart.",Ghost in the Shell
97,jaysshukla,Does not disappoint,8,20 September 2021,"I decided to watch this movie after noticing how similar the poster looks to some of the clips of LaMb, which came out in 2008, 13 years after this movie. Even though I had a mixed feeling for LaMb after watching it but the hype I felt back then was real.The best thing about the 80s or 90s futuristic anime is that the efforts put in art and animation are clearly visible. The animation of Ghost in the shell is on par with even some of the recent anime. That only adds to the enjoyment.As expected the first 15 minutes of the movie were bit dull but the fun starts soon after. The kind of action scenes or chasings or the backgrounds we witness really suits to this theme and genre. However, I feel that in this 1.3 hours of movies, lot of time was taken to show the discussion on individualism and there was only a little focus on the storyline. As a result, it ended up looking incoherent.If I talk about the OST, it is scary and cool at the same time but somehow lacked the impact it should have.If you don't mind watching old stuffs, I wouldn't mind recommending this.

The main character (Kusanagi) presents issues with an obvious existential burden. I am always struck by the fact that this is one of the few movies where the emotional relationships are in the background or does not exist.

I wish there were more movies like this that weren't afraid to attempt serious art with characters that do more than athletic violence.Of course the central character Motoko Kusanagi is a perfectly formed super-female. It isn't made clear (is it ever?) why a ""cyborg"" like this needs to be female, and have a desirable shape with breasts and nipples but no genitalia. (Yes the footage is there to show this, but not as much as some reviewers are making it out to be.) Her sidekick/subordinate Batô makes much more sense, he's a competent buff post-human with most of his original parts replaced with hi-tech and swimming-goggle type devices where his eyes should be. He follows her orders but also has clearly developed a deeper attachment to her -- perhaps that's what the designed-in pulchritude is all about. He goes the extra kilometer to save her, even from herself if necessary.The plot is a bit threadbare, but that doesn't matter, really. It is just a backdrop for Motoko's journey.One recommendation I would make is if you rent the DVD, try watching the Japanese audio with English subtitles (assuming you don't understand Japanese already). The voices are much more believable in that version. The English version often sounds like high-school students reading out loud in class.",Ghost in the Shell

Cyborgs and cybernetically augmented human bodies are an everyday appearance in the near future. A virus-like entity becomes aware and tries to become a sentient being through hacking into people and cyborg's brains. This is basically the premise for the story that involves a lot more than this basis.The animation is absolutely breathtaking and very natural. The SFX are very very cool, especially the thermoptic camouflage. The mood of the picture is very well established through the backgrounds and the music, anime never looked so cool. Voice talents are good enough both in the Japanese and the English version.Over all a very good movie with an intelligent story that will keep you thinking for some time.10/10",Ghost in the Shell
101,Onderhond,A benchmark for anime,9,24 October 2003,"Movie: Ghost In The Shell (OV - English subtitles), 82 minutes, 1995 Director: Mamuro Oshii Writing Credits: Kazunori Itô & Masamune Shirow (manga) Soundtrack: Kenji Kawai Rating: 9/10The year is 1995, and anime isn't very popular among film critics in the West. Sure, there was Akira in 1988, but although it got a lot of mainstream support, the critics weren't at all convinced of the merits of anime. They considered it a violent cartoon for rebellious teens, nothing more. In a way, they were right too. Wings Of Honneamise never made it to the big public, and the critics disregarded it as another violent Japanese cartoon. Things didn't look to well. Along comes Ghost In The Shell. The golden trio from Patlabor 2 is present again, who thus set out to give their view on the popular manga from Masamune Shirow.Director Mamuro Oshii, who already claimed fame with the Patlabor franchise, and was already an established director in Japan, got back together with Itô and Kawai to bring one of the most popular mangas alive. The film became immensely popular, especially outside of Japan, and convinced the brighter critics that anime for the thinking man was not a utopia. Ghost In The Shell was the first arthouse anime that made it big in the West, and it would prove to be a pretty big influence for Western cinema in the future. When, in 1999, The Matrix was unleashed unto the audience, the Wachowski brothers openly admitted they were more than just influenced by Ghost In The Shell. With the coming of the final installment in the Matrix trilogy, it's a good time to take a look at where it all started.Not to say that The Matrix and Ghost In The Shell are similar films. In fact, the approach of both films is radically different. Ghost In The Shell is a slow brooding philosophical film, with only sporadic moments of action. The movie is reassembled from scenes coming from the manga. The film does tell the same basic story as the manga, but the scenes are often put in a slightly different context, to tighten things up. Not surprisingly, Oshii and company made it their own, disappointing quite a few fans from the manga, but ultimately making it a better work.The film follows the doings of Section 9, a special clean-up team that solves political problems in not so political ways. Aramaki, Kusanagi, Batou, Togusa and Ishikawa are all present again, and set out to catch the notorious Puppet Master. As a sidetrack, the film delves into the character of Kusanagi, and her struggles with defining and accepting herself as a living creature. Very little time is devoted to fleshing out the characters, and for those wanting to know all the background story, the manga is the only place to find it. Instead of focusing on character development, Oshii chose to create a world that is vaster then the operations of Section 9. A lot of time was spend on exposing scenery and outlining the possible future society.Visually, Oshii continued to explore the techniques he used to great effect in Patlabor 2. Overlaying 3D models with traditional 2D art to get smoother background scrolling and using filters to enhance certain scenes, are used to it's fullest potential in Ghost In The Shell. The traditional artwork itself is gorgeous too, with mature and detailed character designs, beautiful cityscapes and, considering the time and the complexity of the drawings, very fluid animation. Both styles are mixed seemlessly and will set the standard for many years to come.Equally impressive is the score for Ghost In The Shell. Kenji Kawai really excelled himself, and produced, arguably, his best work to date. More than just fitting the scenes, it defines them, and often forms the base of some of the better scenes. The making of a cyborg scene, the trip through the city, the car chase with the chopper and the battle against the tank are all classic scenes that are constructed on the soft ambient rhythms of Kawai. On many occasions, it feels as if the visuals were tailored to the score, instead of the other way around.The story progresses at a typical pace, with lots of dialogues and monologues, scenic shots and scarce but involving action sequences. Once the Puppet Master is caught, the film reveals it's themes, discussing AI, cyborgization and the line between technology and human life. For those who aren't really familiar with the manga, or sci-fi in general, it might be a bit much to take, and as in many of Oshii's films, there are no answers, only questions. The ending is nice, but might leave some of the viewers disappointed, as it doesn't end with a big bang, as is expected from a film.All in all, it's a typical Oshii film. Lovely atmosphere, gorgeous visuals and soundtrack, and plenty of time dedicated to exploring the theme, instead of developing the story or the characters. It's not the best anime around, although it's a much better ambassador for anime than Akira. It's not even the best Oshii film, considering the length and the fact that the end is a bit rushed. But it remains a true classic, that immerses the viewer in lush and slightly depressing future, and serves as the ideal entry piece for those willing to explore more mature anime. A must watch.",Ghost in the Shell
102,Speechless,A softly poetic masterpiece of science fiction,10,4 April 1999,"A great many people enjoy this movie simply for its violence, technical quality, and nudity.  And yes, while those are indeed very important factors, they have nothing to do with the film's real point.  What very easily could have been a meaningless, fast-paced, ""sexy"" action movie comes out as a shockingly reserved and poetic look at the future of humanity. Personally, I think this is probably the most accurate prediction of the future in the history of cinema; Blade Runner came very close, but failed to see the full civilizational importance of computer technology.  Masamune Shirow took the next step.  He realized that the world of the future will be every bit as grimy and unpleasant as that of today, except computer technology will have taken over every aspect of human life.  Indeed, Project 2501 represents the ultimate achievement of technology--a type of life form which can exist, reproduce, and evolve without ever inhabiting an organic body.  This is the third best sci-fi movie ever, behind the Star Wars films and 2001: A Space Odyssey.",Ghost in the Shell
103,Speechless,A stunning and complex cinematic warning,10,12 November 2000,"Ghost in the Shell is a masterpiece.  I would go so far as to say that it's the second best science fiction film I've ever seen (behind 2001, of course), but no one knows about it.  I find it terribly unfortunate that the only American viewers familiar with Ghost in the Shell are anime fans, many of whom overlook the film's complexity and see only its nudity and violence. The movie kind of gets in its own way-- within the first five minutes we see the heroine's nude body as well as a very messy head-exploding scene, and many of the viewers who would otherwise end up enthralled by the film's abundant style and intelligence immediately dismiss it as exploitative anime trash.  Every time I show this movie to non-anime fans I have to explain beforehand that Ghost in the Shell is a serious work of science fiction and that everything in it, including the adult content, is part of the point the movie makes about where our society is headed.The film is stylish, artistic, and beautiful.  Masamune Shirow's stunningly believable vision of the future makes the jump from manga to anime remarkably well.  As brilliant as the comics are, I really prefer the film version, which eliminates the nearly pornographic T&A (the film has nudity but it's clearly not meant to be titillating) and all of the exaggerated comic relief which only detracted from the manga in my opinion.  The film's action sequences are strikingly different from the overly stylized symphonies of destruction seen in most action films.  Gunfire, martial arts combat, and car chases are depicted exactly as they would occur in the real world-- without fast music or Armageddon-style hyper-editing or any of the needless cinematic baggage we've come to expect.  But it's the movie's ideas that make it great, particularly in the last half hour, when thoughtful viewers learn what this story is all about-- the emergence of a new kind of life form, an intelligent and self-aware intelligence that can live indefinitely without ever inhabiting a physical body.  The film argues that this will occur within the next thirty years, and the superbly ambiguous ending inspires us to come up with our own ideas of what will happen to humanity once this new life form begins to reproduce.  This is filmmaking that should be seen and discussed.And now the disclaimer.  All of the above comments refer to the subtitled Japanese version of the film, NOT the English dub.  Simply put, the dub ruins everything.  A good example is Kusanagi's wry comment at the very beginning of the film.  An officer who is communicating with Kusanagi through a kind of electronic telepathy tells her there's a lot of static in her brain.  In the original Japanese version (as well as in the manga) she replies that ""It's that time of the month,"" but in the dub her comment is inexplicably changed to ""Must be a loose wire.""  It's completely insane-- do they think that, in a film with considerable nudity and graphic violence, people are going to be offended by a PMS innuendo?  The whole movie is filled with such intelligence-insulting changes; please do yourself a favor and watch the subtitled version.",Ghost in the Shell
104,steve.schonberger,"It's ""cyberpunk"", and I liked it anyway!",8,19 July 2000,"This was one of the first animated Japanese movies I've see; the only other was the mythical adventure Mononoke Hime. I can only compare it to live-action movies with science fiction themes.The movie is set in a future Hong Kong where cyborgs are common enough that even some of the garbage men have computers linked into their brains. The title refers to the distinction between the ""ghost"", the conscious mind that makes a person human, and the ""shell"", a person's natural or artificial body.At the beginning, the ""Section 9"" internal security agency has its best agents investigating computer crimes linked to the mysterious individual known as the Puppet Master. His (or possibly her) nickname refers to the Puppet Master's criminal specialty, mind-controlling people by way of their own brain-implanted computer links.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs ""Section 6"" is also interested in the Puppet Master, who has apparently attempted to manipulate international diplomacy. Sections 6 and 9 soon come into conflict over how to pursue the Puppet Master, although it appears that a hostile internal rivalry already existed between those branches of government.Section 9's top agent, ""Major"" Kusanagi is a cyborg who is mostly machine. Her investigative partner is Tosuga, a married man who still has almost all of his natural body. She has doubts about how human she is when she has almost nothing of her natural body left except her brain, and finds a mostly-natural partner reassuring. As she learns more about the Puppet Master, her doubts about her human ""ghost"" deepen.The main plots are the pursuit of the Puppet Master, the government in-fighting, and Kusanagi's self-doubt. The interlinked plots are complicated enough to confuse an inattentive viewer. But watching closely, one can see that everything in the movie was leading toward the conclusion, although I could only managed to see that after I had seen the conclusion.The characters all seemed to have motives that rationally explained their actions. In many movies, they would just do whatever the screenwriter needed them to do. The movie was good science fiction, with a lot of mystery and action, and a little politics and philosophy -- not just cyberpunk technobabble. Unlike so much science fiction, worst of all cyberpunk, the story isn't just a carrier for special effects, the story is the soul of the movie.The animation was good, comparable in quality to mid-range Disney, but far short of masterpieces like Mononoke Hime. The artistic design was very good, with lots of depth and atmosphere, in the style of Blade Runner relocated to Hong Kong. The weapons and armed combat showed clear attention to realism. Overall, the movie was very good visually.I watched the movie twice, in part to compare the Japanese and English voices. The Japanese voices were very expressive, although I couldn't understand the dialog without the subtitles. The English voices varied between competent and lackluster. The two versions are somewhat complementary -- the Japanese voices bring much more emotion to the movie, but the English sound track is often clearer on details than the somewhat-condensed English subtitles. Best of all is probably the Japanese sound track, for those who understand Japanese.The music was excellent. The sound effects were very good. The overall sound quality was good on my modest sound system. I don't know how much better it would be in fancy surround sound.Overall, the movie is very good.",Ghost in the Shell
105,jtwcosmos,Ghost in the Shell (1995),7,28 August 2011,"""Overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death.""This is the story of a cyborg cop and her team, on a mission to catch a thief. The animated movie has interesting direction, good animation, great music but a weak script.Director Mamoru Oshii goes old school, in this movie. His technique reminded me of Tarkovsky's movies. There are moments when the camera simply stops in place, lost in a long contemplation, as people go in and out of the picture. There is also the use of water. Water is a mirror, reflecting the reality above, around and beyond it.Other than that, the action scenes are well done, and during dialogues the camera has a way of focusing on the person who listens, not on the one who is talking, which may be confusing, at first, but then it becomes quite interesting. The camera moves a lot, and the director makes a point out of filling in the entire space around the characters.The animation is good, a bit dated by today's standards, maybe, but still very well done. The characters are interesting, and the surroundings are full of small, fine touches, of which some may seem like overkill, at first, but they all add to the atmosphere of the movie.The music is great. The leitmotif is haunting, it is surprising and quite stirring. It also complements very well the images on the screen.The script, however, is the weak point of the movie. It it too short and it fails to explain just what is going on in this movie. It starts well, it has great pacing and it builds nicely, but then it grinds to a halt about midpoint and it never gets going again. The main premise of the movie remains unexplained: just what is a ghost and how does somebody hack into it? Are all humans cyborgs? Do they all have artificial bodies? Or just a few?On a deeper level, the script tries to touch on a more interesting problem: what exactly do humans feel, if you take away their body? Are they still humans? Or something else? Are they still capable of love and devotion?Ghost in the Shell. A good action anime, that develops a midlife crisis. 7/10.",Ghost in the Shell

But the characters are poorly drawn , even for an anime, and their voices, with dull B-movie American accents, undermine the impact of the soundtrack. The plot is convoluted and confusing, with gaps and discontinuities which suggest substantial cuts and boring speeches which try - and fail - to excuse the plot's inconsistencies. It was more subtle than most animated science-fiction films - but this is a reflection less on this film than on the general run of SF on film. Overall, disappointing after all the hype about it.",Ghost in the Shell
107,i_ianchev,Perpetuation,10,5 February 2014,"If you'd like to see what life was, is and will be - watch 1995's ""Ghost in the shell"" by Mamoru Oshii...A long time ago I watched an animated movie titled ""Kōkaku kidōtai"" and it blew my mind. It seems that it impressed the Wachowskis and James Cameron the same way. As a fan of animation and anime in particular I have always been fond of this cinematographic masterpiece. It has long been a milestone with both its strong visuals and plot. Using digitally generated animation and digital audio Oshii's work is not only ahead of its time, but ahead of our time as well. We may be more technically advanced than back then 1995, but most of the current productions lack the vision embodied in ""Ghost in the shell"".The story of the movie (which is based on the manga of the same title by Masamune Shirow) revolves around the main character Major Motoko Kusanagi's (a perceptional cyborg) hunt for the elusive Puppet Master. Her team of professionals from Public Security Section 9 is also a nice set of characters (especially Batou). For me it is important to tell you that I fell in love with the story from the very first night scenes of futuristic Tokyo. But it is even more important to contemplate on the rhetorical questions which linger in ""Kōkaku kidōtai"".Many people around the world have found their meaning in this anime. For me it is an art piece about the meaning of human life. We all life in an era where technology and communication are an integral part of our lives. Now we question the value of life even more than before. Humanity searches for the answer of the ever valid questions ""Why are we here?"", ""What is the meaning of our lives?"", ""Are our souls immortal?"" and so on. In this anime the director doesn't give us answers, but rather shows us the right questions which consist of the answers. And let me emphasize on one quote to show you what I'm talking about. When confronted by the ever doubting Kusanagi, The Puppet Master says: ""I refer to myself as an intelligent life form because I am sentient and I am able to recognize my own existence, but in my present state I am still incomplete. I lack the most basic processes inherent in all living organisms: reproducing and dying."" And continues: ""Life perpetuates itself through diversity and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system."" What is this all about? It is about the meaning of life. The answer we all seek. And we first see it in the entering scene where Motoko's body is created by machines, not by ordinary reproducing means. The main character has identity issues throughout the whole movie and they originates in ""her"" post-human body which ultimately cannot reproduce, but rather copy itself. And the whole odyssey of Kusanagi finds its conclusion at the end of the film when she is united with the Puppet Master in one sentient being. Evolution in a new form...Is this the meaning of life? Evolution? Is this the future of human life? I cannot be sure about that, but this is what Oshii shows us. In our hectic modern life we are very much frustrated with the means of reproducing and the juxtaposition of the sexes. This in fact is the main issue of today's society. And this is why art works such as ""Ghost in the shell"" push us a step further in the evolution of our minds.",Ghost in the Shell

110,AW_McGOWAN,Japanese Ghost In The American Action Movie Psyche,7,16 December 2020,"Truth be told, I am not incredibly versed in the world of Japanese animation. I've seen some of Hayao Miyazaki's work, watched a few episodes of Pokémon as a kid, and in 2018, accompanied some friends to see ""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" in theaters. Coming from outside the culture, I liked what I saw, but left feeling quite puzzled.Nevertheless, I sought out Mamoru Oshii's ""Ghost In The Shell"" for its famed reputation as well as its hefty influence on Western cinema. Allegedly, this 1995 Japanese cartoon was one of the Wachowski siblings' main inspirations when creating ""The Matrix."" Aesthetically, I can see the similarities, but narratively, it seems to fall more in line with Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner,"" or even more so with Denis Villeneuve's ""Blade Runner 2049.""Based on a manga of the same title, ""Ghost In The Shell"" takes place sometime in the digitized future, ""where corporate networks fill the Earth with electronic and optical communication lines, but society has not yet been too computerized to erase nations and races."" The plot focuses on cyborg government agent Motoko Kusanagi (Atsuko Tanaka original, Mimi Woods dubbed) tracking down an infamous hacker known as ""The Puppet Master"" (Iemasa Kayumi original, Tom Wyner dubbed). This elusive menace has worked his way into the consciousness of cyborgs-human hybrids, jeopardizing their free will. In her pursuit, Motoko faces philosophical questions about human nature that, as a full android, she never before considered.That is the boiled down version of the story. Having only watched the film once, I cannot say that I fully grasp all of its intricacies. It's hard science fiction mixed with dystopia, creating endless avenues for universe exploration and deeper contemplation. Meanwhile, its parallels with American live action films are ubiquitous. One could perhaps trace the whole domestic interest in cyberpunk back to this Japanese cartoon.While watching, however, I paid more attention to the film's visuals than I did to its plot. Like most foreign animation, the medium is used differently here from what we might expect in America. For the most part, ""Ghost In The Shell"" could emulate a Saturday morning cartoon, but it distinguishes itself with some pretty graphic images (blood, guts, and nudity) that commercial American animators would probably shy away from.Still, the movie looks pretty slick. The character designs are original and neat, and I especially liked the futuristic cityscapes in the background. I won't judge whether it's better or worse than the American animation put out in that same year - ""Toy Story"" and ""Pocahontas"" in theaters; ""Gargoyles"" and ""Batman: The Animated Series"" on television. All I will say is that it is of an entirely different style.That style might estrange some American audiences. Also, pairing a high-concept story with the medium of animation could feel drastically unfamiliar. This is probably why ""Ghost In The Shell"" retains but a cult following in the United States, even though it inspired so many of our mainstream filmmakers. Therefore, the film itself is a ghost, invisibly dancing in the shell of American action iconography.",Ghost in the Shell
111,mjensen-3,This is one of the best movie of the 90'S,9,17 May 2002,"""Ghost in The Shell"" is one of the best movies ever. Mamoru Oshi's Animated Thriller has become one of the greatest films of all time. This is a stunning work of speculative fiction and the first truly adult anime film to reach a level of literary and visual excellence. But the idea of this movie could have never been created without the help of ""Akira"". Katsuhiro Otomo was the guy who originated the idea of making an animated movie with a message.""Ghost in The Shell"" tried to give the same hard-hitting message as ""Akira"" had but it failed. It tried to give the message through biblical references, not action.  Much of the action in Akira showed government officials standing about and discussing ideas  about what they were going to do the civilians as if the civilians were lab mice. ""Ghost in The Shell"" attempted to question our existence and it did but to me unsuccessfully. In my opinion ""Ghost in The Shell"" will never equal the movie ""Akira."" ""Akira"" was the first and only anime film to truly question our existence.I do congratulate this movie for it's stunning 3D effects. The effects show that anime has grown to a new level. ""Akira"" started the new anime 3D effects, ""Ghost in The Shell"" took it to a new level, and the new Anime film ""Metropolis"" completed the trilogy. I would also like to say something to people who complain that this film has to much nudity. Look, if you want to see an anime film  with no nudity, go see a Walt Disney movie. This is an intelligent and challenging science fiction film  aimed at smart audiences.I recommend this film to anyone who likes anime movies. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",Ghost in the Shell
112,Quag7,Excellent.,10,25 October 2001,"I liked everything about this film.  Much has been made of the artwork, and with good reason.  Voltron, this isn't.  I am not an anime fan and haven't seen a lot of anime films.  Most plot descriptions of anime films sound boring to me.  I'm not into monsters and tentacles or cute wide eyed little girls fighting evil.  (Not that cute wide eyed little girls shouldn't fight evil, I mean, I'm all about fighting evil, aren't we all?)  Ghost in the Shell, on the other hand, represents the best of its genre and the best of any genre is worth a watch.  This movie ought to appeal to anyone who enjoys cerebral films.  It addresses interesting philosophical questions about identity, some of which we will no doubt be pondering in the not too distant future.  (I'm perhaps foolishly optimistic when it comes to AI).I should add as well that this is definitively in the cyberpunk genre.  If you liked the old Max Headroom television series or movies like Wargames, this will no doubt appeal to you.  Even the English dubbing isn't bad, even if it is a little bit fast (to keep up with Japanese).Darken the room, sink low in your chair, turn the volume up (the soundtrack is spectacular), and fall into this movie.  I wish there were more like it. The artwork is incredible (if you don't consider animation art, you should take a look at Ghost) and the plot and dialogue are three dimensional and thought provoking.  Two thumbs up.  As I say, best of genre.",Ghost in the Shell
113,kmberger,One of the master's best.,10,26 September 2000,"Very few people can do well what Masamune Shirow does all the time - make beautiful, intricate animations that are pitch-perfect in tone and style.Shirow is best known for his high-tech science fiction, which is exemplified perfectly here.  The blending of humanity with machinery, and its effect on the soul, are themes that are treated with delicate reverence.  It's easy to throw something out there that's simplistic in its ideals, showing nothing more than a babe with big guns.Ghost in the Shell is nothing near simplistic.  Its storyline is complex, yet comprehensible.  Even with all the scientific jargon and sometimes confusing imagery, the flow of the story is maintained, with haunting visuals and a soundtrack that is incredibly evocative.It's a beautiful film, one of the very best, and if you're a long-time anime fan, or someone just looking to peek into this new genre, or a fan of high-quality film-making, this will have something to show you.",Ghost in the Shell

Granted, the original Japanese audio may work better for some viewers because the English dubs are a bit of struggle to keep up with. The structure also jumps around quickly, making the plot feel somewhat disjointed.As for its technical flair, the visuals are amazing with animations that are slick - especially during destruction heavy shoot outs. The music is also fantastic and creates a euphoric and heavenly use of atmospheric pads/drones which really stands out in sombre moments. The overarching plot themes are thought provoking and intelligent with likeable characters and it manages to keep you entertained for its run time but you can't help but feel cut short.",Ghost in the Shell
116,ajrcvr,"Average anime & action, way too complex a story, too much philosophical talk",5,3 August 2016,"I think my summary pretty much says it. I watched this because I like the better anime out there as a sci-fi and fantasy writer of many books myself. This story absolutely had the potential for a great movie, and some of the futuristic ideas are very cool, which is why I gave it the rating that I did. Unfortunately, most of the ""science"" presented is suspect, at best, as to whether it would ever be possible, and certainly not as it has been presented here; what we see here is fantasy, which is fine, if it's done well. This isn't. That aside, there is entirely too much talking in the movie where more action would have been appropriate. And way too much philosophy about what it is everyone is supposed to be doing. I don't care. Show me! It' a movie, not a philosophical treatise.As to the quality of the film, the animation itself is average for this type of thing, while the graphics have some good scenes and some schlock scenes. More disturbing than that is that Motoko, the main character, is not consistently presented in all scenes. She is supposed to be this beautiful cyborg, and who knows for what reason, but sometimes she is, and sometimes she isn't. That consistency problem holds true for the other characters also. You won't see that in the better anime. Giving you 2 productions that get the graphics right, there are ""Gargantia on the Vedurous Planet,"" which is spectacularly done in backgrounds and characters, and ""Expelled from Paradise,"" which has the same high standard. ""Ghost in the Shell"" simply doesn't measure up, either in its first or second version. More problematical is never telling us what ""the ghost"" actually is! They talk about it a lot, but never specify what it actually is. We have to guess, from Koestler's ""Ghost in the Machine, "" (& Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke) from which this film draws its inspiration, that it is a sentient being's mind within its body, or shell, and from some machines' mysterious evolution to becoming more than they were programmed for, having emotion and motivation.Unfortunately, the characters, regardless of how well they are written, are blandly portrayed in this movie, and they don't improve in the remake, ""Ghost in the Shell 2,"" which is essentially a duplicate of the first one with a few insignificant variations. What Motoko's motivations are we never learn, right to the confusing ending, and it seems they robotize her far too much when she has an actual human brain. Okay, she's a Major, so she can be tough and cool and collected, but not insensitive and cold, which is how they present her. It would be a better story if she were warmer and just a little more humane. Why make her a beautiful woman if she's going to act like a piece of furniture that moves! The tachikoma robot tanks have more personality! As for the story, well, except for the government agency Section 9 fighting terrorists and other bad guys, there really isn't much more. The characters don't really develop, we don't go from point 'A' to point 'C' with a firm resolution, just many little vignettes, which would be okay, if they did the whole thing better. They didn't, and so although this could have been great, it becomes rather average as the writer mauls us with mostly nonsensical philosophical gobbledegook.",Ghost in the Shell

Watching this movie requires the audience's full attention so that it can be understood. That complexity isn't a bad thing. It depends on the audience whether they'll appreciate this movie or not. In my case, it was pretty hard to appreciate because things happen very slow.

The debate around this theme is done with mastery, leaving anyone to reflect on it for hours.What Ghost In The Shell does is take our hands and throw us without any support in that world, and as much as we are lost with so much information in front of us, at no time does the film treat us as unable to understand, the only thing that he asks is our attention and deduction.And speaking of the world, what a wonderful setting, the cities, despite being technologically evolved, are still rustic, full of slums and dirty alleys, showing that even with so much evolution in the field of science and engineering, the human being will never leave misery, especially involving the ordinary citizens, a society that is beautiful and full of rich details, is claustrophobic and threatening due to its crowds and lack of privacy, the film to reserve good minutes with its setting is a hit.The animation is impeccable, the scene of the open-air fair and the boat ride make this very clear, I have never seen a world so alive in an animation as before, and I still haven't found another one to compare (besides its sequence of course) Also worthy of mention is the fabulous lighting work, clearly visible at night, with car panels and building lights that illuminate the city.The ambience is also due to the work of Kenji Kawai on the soundtrack, once we hear it, it will not leave our heads, both in relation to the main theme that brings a choir of traditional Japanese music along with traditional female vocals from Bulgaria, as well as dirty but smooth industrial trail.Ghost In The Shell is about the search for being, the search for free will and taking the reins of life itself, navigating the possibilities of the world without restraints or surveillance.""Who we are? Are we who we claim to be or are we limited to being what we think of ourselves? Perhaps we have no sense of our own being until we find it and show our true identity to ourselves."" that's the question that gets in my head every time I review this movie.

120,madonnawb,Very Cool Anime,9,18 September 2007,"I saw this movie last night I can understand why it's such a cult film in the realm of manga- first of all, the computer graphics and the animation is amazing: such attention to detail and really bringing scenes to life.Then the binary sequence code at the opening scene strikes such resemblance to matrix, well vice-versa actually, including the connecting place through the back of the neck. Combined with that is the philosophy of self awareness: I am aware of my existence because I feel it, but how do I know I really exist and how do I define and prove it; can there be different forms of existence (especially when it comes to artificial intelligence) and how do we explain them and what complication can it bring.The only thing is I wish it was a bit longer- it ends rather too quickly (it's only 80 min long), right after the Puppet Master and our heroine do ""the merge"" and create a so-called offspring, leaving us wondering what does its future hold. Also, I don't know if it was just my edition I was watching (it had a different cover than this one) but some of the characters including the lead character Motoko Kusanagi sounded like they were just reading their lines without actually giving emotion and real life voice- unlike other characters. I don't know if that was the point since she is a cyborg, but it sounded so off it almost killed the appeal of the character.Other than that, I really enjoyed it, especially considering it came out in 1995... wow....",Ghost in the Shell

122,Lepidopterous_,Cerebral and Groundbreaking,10,14 November 2012,"Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell is a science fiction anime film that raised the bar for Japanese animation. Its complex woven narrative is set in a society where being a full-flesh human is no longer the norm. Is humanity losing its existence or is it loosely defined? Cyborgs are part human, part machine, and a continuation of a previously ""whole"" human entity. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a full-replacement cyborg in the national security division Section 9, is investigating a mysterious hacker who goes by the name ""The Puppet Master."" It may be apparent throughout the film that many of its aspects and ideas have been borrowed for other films such as The Matrix (source code; plugging into the network) and Inception (diving into another's conscious).Ghost in the Shell's portrayal of the significant role of networking in society appears strange and exaggerated to us but carries with it a strong familiarity and subtle message. Our reliance on networking is similarly demonstrated in The Matrix, but GITS takes it beyond questioning the basis of reality by turning to the self. The dualistic nature of mankind's existence is so prominently explored that it is reflected by the film's title itself. Physical vs. metaphysical mind vs. body the ghost vs. the shell. Cartesian dualism is a theory that the mind and body interact yet remain distinct from one another. Major Kusanagi contemplates what determines the identity of an individual. What defines life? Almost entirely artificially constructed, she questions her own existence. Is the ghost distinct from the shell? When someone is ghost hacked, they no longer have memories. So is the ghost (a loose metaphor for mind) what defines the self? Her resolution is reached as she merges with the Puppet Master, who suggests that life is simply a component of the network of all things. After the merge, the major and hacker share one entity with a blueprint for regeneration and become an integral part of the network by achieving a higher consciousness. The chief of Section 6 refers to the Puppet Master as a self-preserving program to which the hacker objects that by that logic, the human genome is no different. The Puppet Master claims to be a ghost born ""within the flow of information"" and goes on to define life from a person's memories. Ghost in the Shell manages to mix seamlessly integrated CGI and hand drawn animation, a complex but fitting plot, a resonant score, intermittent action sequences (complete with thermoptic camouflage!), and heavy philosophy (without being preachy) into an 82 minute runtime to make for a profound experience with loads of replay value.",Ghost in the Shell

And then goes on during the entire length of the movie. For some reason, she has to get nude to become invisible, but - how convenient! - a male character doesn't. Any attempt made at being ""deep"" gets lost in the excess of what detracts from the story and the complete lack of what should be in it. The final culmination scene is a huge letdown and feels completely tacked on, especially given its puzzling short duration compared to the rest of the forced artsy and philosophical writing. I feel like this could have possibly been something, but it turns into little more than bad dialogue and an eyeroll-inducing ""Would you like to see more boobs while we try to unironically describe the excess of humanity?"" real quick.",Ghost in the Shell
124,cinema_lover97,A high point in Cyberpunk genre,8,20 October 2020,"I know what this film has done for the Sci-Fi and Cyberpunk genre. How many movies and tv shows it has inspired. This film is definitely an experience to soak in through your visual and auditory senses.I saw this film 3 years back for the first time, and I didn't like it much then because I was expecting an action film, a result of watching the trailers. Today I watched it for the second time, and I liked it much more because I knew what to expect and the film is also seriously well made.The two standouts for me are obviously the visuals and the score. I mean it when I say that the look and color palette of this film beat any Pixar animated movie. The world and characters in those movies look too glossy and superfluous. In this film, the images show a world that feels alive, breathing like an organism. The images are gritty and amazingly detailed. Every time I heard the vocals on the main theme composed by Kenji Kawai, I got goosebumps on my skin. The vocals sounded like a call from the past, telling the mysteries of life in my ear.If I were to talk about the cons, this film only has two, in my opinion, that is the plot and character writing. The plot of this film felt like I jumped straight into the middle episode of a 5 episode long series. Most details related to Section 6 and their motives went over my head. I liked the philosophical dialogues, but it stopped me from relating to the characters or understand them. The ending made a lesser impact on me because of that.

The main character, Motoko Kusanagi, is a cybernetic human detective with an entirely artificial body. The plot follows Kusanagi and her team as they try to take down a terrorist hacker.With an extremely deep story and amazing animation, Ghost in the Shell is fun for any adult audience. The concept is thought- provoking and fascinating; the inevitable extension of life using technology. The personality of an individual can be uploaded into an artificial body, and is referred to as a ""ghost"" in the movie, hence the title, with the ""shell"" being the body.Despite the amazing story and writing, there are times when the story seems to drag on with exposition. At these times, you marvel at how the movie can be so fascinating and yet so boring at the same time. You want to explore this world more and are left wanting. Another criticism of the movie that can be made is the over-the-top use of nudity. Yes, we know that teens love breasts, we get it. Giant, bouncy, robot bosoms for everyone.

They stripped the ENTIRE story into a paper thin version of the Puppeteer background in the manga, filling in the spaces with watered down parts from the manga, added material that sucks etc. One of the time fillers was a boring 12 minute scene of Kusanagi just looking around while they were on a boat with music that's not bad, but it really downs your mood. The animation is great, but unfortunately the movie is way to overrated. Skip this one, for the love of god, SKIP IT!!! Go out and buy Kôkaku kidôtai by Masamune Shirow, he needs more recognition!! This movie totally tarnishes the graphic novel!!!!!!!!!",Ghost in the Shell
127,bscrivener-50810,A visually beautiful sci-fi anime- with a deep philosophical message.,9,12 June 2016,"At a time during the late 80's and early 90's when anime was mainly finding it's fan base worldwide, a spree of now classic traditional Japanese cel animation films were released beginning with Akira in 1988, followed by Ninja Scroll in 1993 and two years later, Ghost in the Shell. Set in the year 2029, when technology now has made major advancements and is essential to everyday life, the most prolific forms of crime come in the form of hacking and cyber attacks. Major Motoko Kusanagi and her assault team are assigned to capture an elusive hacker known only as The Puppetmaster with the aid of a rival agency, Section 6. What is most impressive about Ghost in the Shell's story are the philosophical, subliminal messages that are questioned, with queries and themes based around the meaning of life, understanding existence and the perceptions of being human. These deep layers give us insights into our ever changing world as we become more and more demanding and dependant on our technological advancements. Our introduction to the world in the opening credits with the beautifully haunting and hypnotic scores of Kenji Kawai, a mix of an ancient and contemporary sound working with the gorgeous visuals of the cyborg creation of Motoko, help enforce these themes right from the start almost playing out like an illusion or dream. The gritty, dirty and realistic cel animation as always looks magnificent, even by today's standards, the animation is smooth and crisp and the plot flows well with a distinct first, second and third act. While the film is visually and audibly near-perfect, The plot can seem a little bit confusing and unfortunately left me scratching my head and having a hard time comprehending what is actually happening away from the main story. The movie also seems to rely on some exposition, which may have been better explained through scenes therefore leading us as an audience to have a better understanding of the rivalry between Section 6 and Section 9 and the world issues as a whole. As a summary, Ghost in the Shell is visually stunning, audibly enchanting as well as both eye-opening and thought provoking and definitely one of the better anime films, however it's complex plot and heavy exposition just slightly hold it back from being one of the masterpieces of animation. 9/10",Ghost in the Shell
128,Sneaky_Pete_XXVII,One of the Best Science-fiction films.,10,1 December 2003,"This is one of those films, that someone is going to have to make a REALLY good film, in order for beat it. And I think for many reasons, that won't be for a while. And its already been 8 years!  The main reason I believe this is the combination of imagination, story, dialogue, and music. And what a great mixture it is.  The imagination amoung this film is beyond comprehension. Both Kazunori Itô and Masamune Shirow, must of went insane after coming up with such a grand idea! The ideas of ""diving"" into ""ghosts"", ""ghosthacking"", etc, are like nothing I've ever seen in cinematic history.  The story is really really fantasic! My god...I enjoy how this move has the plot of an on-going chase, along with the minor problems along the way. The great thing too, is that later on you realize that the minor problems are only a fragment of the grander issue.  The dialogue(like the imagination), is something so unheard of. And I'm glad its here in ""Ghost in the Shell"". As the story moves on, here and there we grasp interesting conversation of philosophy and psychology.  And finally the music. Kenji Kawai emotionally sets this film up perfectly with music. And the whole film gives off the feeling of a depressing society that continues to drag to and endless future. Whether or not that's what they were aiming for...I enjoyed it.  Truly a perfect film.",Ghost in the Shell
129,antialias11,Unbelievable,10,23 January 2005,"That anime could be this good. I'd thought I'd seen good anime when a friend brought me 'Akira', but this one is just awesome.It has everything that one could want. An interesting plot, deep thoughts, nice dialog, hot chicks, cool action, neat tech, and animation that puts everything to shame which has ever been produced in the western world.Now when I watch anime I usually expect (and dread) the scene which will explain something about the fundamental nature of life, the universe, or whatever. This is (the only part) where 'Akira' failed. This is where 'Final Fantasy' went down the drain. But 'Ghost in the Shell' shines here brightly. While watching it for the first time I had always this nagging feeling that some such scene would turn up and ruin the truly stunning visuals. Not so. After the '2501' monologue the story really comes together and you start to be eager for story development instead of just looking for the many details and extravagant action sequences.A word on the story: No, you will probably not 'get' the story the first time around. Especially in the English version you will have to make the connection between MoFA, MF, MFA and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that is easy to get confused over. The whole storyline might not be quite as complicated as understanding some 'Aeon Fluxx' episodes, but you have to rewatch the story to get a feel for the interconnection of the different players - especially if you are not familiar with the Ghost in the Shell literature. The story,thank god, is not dumbed down for the average viewer. This is what makes rewatching it so enjoyable. It has also some nice reflections on what it means to be human - things you may ask of yourself after the movie finishes ('Who knows what's inside our heads. Have you ever seen your own brain?').The animation is superb, and used to unusual effect. The details are exquisite - especially cloth effects and character motions. There are a few scenes that only have music or an accentuating sound effect in the background while the animators show off their full artistic talent. But it's not just show-off time, the visuals are tied in with the subject and leave the viewer time to reflect on the philosophical/sociological messages (like showing the cybernetic heroine look at tailors' dummies)In short: This is a must see for anybody who likes anime. Definitely a movie for grown-ups, though, because the graphic violence may disturb kids and the philosophy will go right over their heads.10/10",Ghost in the Shell
130,rolfesam,All soul and no heart makes Ghost in the Shell an interesting discussion on what it is to be human,9,16 December 2016,"Ghost in the Shell is a movie that is practically drowning in its own philosophy and style. the latter of which has been taken to other films in the West such as the Matrix which lift certain looks like the green falling text and the green overtone. Style can be lifted and stolen from film to film with varying degrees of success but it is important to note that style does not make a movie great. While some movies can pull this off like how studios are making more and more 3D animated films in the style of classic Pixar other times it can feel like a cheap imitation or knock off. the philosophy of a movie on the other hand is something that can not be stolen with little thought like a superficial styling and that is where you can start to separate the great movies from the cheap imitators. And if there were one area that Ghost in the Shell excels it is in its presentation of its many philosophies. In a lot of ways this movie is entirely made to express certain philosophies with each of the main cast of characters. (Note: if you are reading this and haven't seen the movie I am going to be going into some spoiler territory on the film so be warned)The Major is a cyborg that works for the police crew known as section 9 that spends the movie wondering what, if any difference there is between cyborgs like her and normal human people. Her ideas that there is an intrinsic difference between a person who faces mortality and those that don't in how they view the world around them. Bato is another cyborg working at section 9 that holds the opposite philosophy. He claims that everything is the same and has equal effects on people regardless of his cyborg parts. Really he very rarely refers to himself as a cyborg and thinks of himself in the human population. where the major has lost touch with a lot of her emotions and indeed the notion of sexuality where she has no problem being nude around people where Bato constantly covers her with his own jacket or shirt. He also makes a point that artificial memories are just as valid as real ones which once again shows his ideals towards retaining his humanity.The last character I'll talk about is the main antagonist of the movie known as the Puppet Master. The Puppet Master (which I'll call PM from now on) is a fully functioning AI with no trace of a human soul or 'ghost' in it, yet he/she feels that they can attain a form of humanity through the act of combining with the major to form a new being which is thought of in the movie as almost the same as creating a child through the lose of the parents. where as the major sees herself drifting away from humanity and Bato firmly standing by his humanity the PM is as far away from it as you can get but believes he/she can attain it through their own actions. These characters and their opposing ideologies are what makes the film stand out as more than a pretty looking piece of animation. It's what makes the slow and methodical action feel tense instead of boring and makes our investment in the characters more concrete. Go see this movie if you want to learn how to incorporate philosophy into characters or if you want to see an anime with more grounded action than what we are often given. I will say if you do not like blood or nudity then this movie will make you uncomfortable but is still a movie worth checking out for the reasons stated before.",Ghost in the Shell
131,sherbetsaucers,"Man, I Missed The Bus With This One",7,6 February 2007,"I must admit I do not know much about animé. When talking to an animé buff recently about this project and my comparative lack of knowledge of the genre, the conversation of what I had seen and what I owned rolled around. I declared that I did own a few things, one of them being Ninja Scrolls. 'Which version?' I was asked. Blinking for a moment I thought Luckily I realised I had the box set with two versions on it, the Japanese and English versions. I told him this, also pointing out that I had only watched the Japanese dub. That kind of thing always goes down well with geeks. (We can smell our own). However I was looked at with a mixture of pity and despair. No, that was the wrong version of Ninja Scrolls. I was ashamed.So it was with some trepidation I dipped my toe into the hugely complex world of animé That feeling was off-set however with a certain amount of anticipation. I'd always been told how great Ghost In The Shell is, by many people whose views I respect, and so I looked forward to this movie. Unfortunately I'm still trying to work out what is so great about it.Set in a cyberpunk future where the whole world is connected by a vast network of electronic data, the hero, Motoko Kusanagi Atsuko Tanaka - or 'The Majour' as she is known - is part of Section 9, a high-tech crime fighting unit. The plot itself involves concepts such as AI and 'Ghosts', a term meaning a persons consciousness. We are asked to consider ideas such as what constitutes life, humanity and death itself while Section 9 deal with a hacker known as The Puppet Master, who is wanted by the highly suspect Section 6. (Hmmm 9, but reversed) Needless to say there are layers of intrigue and suspense and we are also given the chance to watch some pretty impressive animation. The core of this movie, what Shirow really seems to emphasise, are the ethical and philosophical questions raised by this brave new world.With the title itself clearly referencing the term Ghost In The Machine - a phrase first used by Gilbert Ryle and a concept later expanded on by Arthur Koestler (basically a refutation of Descartes idea of dualism) - I expected a large amount of philosophy. I have no problem with large amounts of philosophy. Unfortunately the philosophy I was given wasn't (to me) all that exciting. It is important to realise that I am watching this now in 2007 and the concepts may have seemed new in 1995, especially to an audience not overly familiar with the works of people such as Koestler and such. Yet for me the ponderings of the cybernetic humans are vaguely reminiscent of the kind of conversation had at about 10.54 down the pub, when people often say things like 'Yeah, I know what you're saying, but you're not thinking about it like this'. The most interesting concept was the idea of reproduction as a form of immortality, and that a computer program may want to do this. The further idea of two different beings creating a new life, one that links human and AI consciousness and creates a new and different being, perhaps the next step of evolution, was also interesting. Sadly the fact that these concepts and ideas do not occur until the end of the movie meant that I found the movie difficult to really enjoy.The director spends a lot of time between scenes simply showing us the city this is all set in. There is much use of simply driving by the landscape. Again this was very beautiful but as I personally had been unable to invest myself in the movie, I didn't really enjoy these parts, and instead found them distracting, wanting to get onto the next bit of something actually happening.The realisation of the cyberpunk world is outstanding, the art fantastic and attention to detail something to revel in. Although as I am not the biggest cyberpunk fan that the world has ever seen, this wasn't enough to make me fall for this movie.So I was left with the action scenes. Having now watched this movie I can see just how much it inspired The Matrix visually as well as stylistically. The action scenes are amazingly well conceived and directed, the feeling of movement on screen is particularly well done. Yet they are few and far between, not really allowing me to enjoy this movie on a purely action-based level either.So I am left feeling vaguely disappointed, not just in the movie but with myself as well. When mentioning this movie to a friend a few nights back he nodded enthusiastically and told me ""Yeah it's great!"" When I simply asked why, he seemed a little confused. I want to like this movie more than I do, but I simply cannot. I know that it is part of a series of movies, and that there is also a television series based within the same universe, and as is so often the case, this is all based on an original graphic novel. Perhaps I'd find one of these to be great?",Ghost in the Shell
132,Bioweapon,A movie that should be mandatory to watch in any Science/Medicine/Engineering/Computing School,9,6 June 2010,"This is a modern art masterpiece, from beginning to end. It is eye candy and food for thought. All of your senses (except smell and taste) will be delighted.Where do I start?An outstanding soundtrack by Kenji Kawai makes you feel immersed in what society might be in 100 years from now (although plot is set earlier, I believe technology will not be so advanced until the 22nd century).Artwork is simply sublime. It is hard to believe that such animations were drawn one at the time. This movie puts CrapVatar to shame. Don't believe me? check the intro only.Insight into science and society is awesome. It is hard for me to explain, but as a scientist I believe that trends in science and computing are guiding us in a complex society such as the one depicted in the movie, where each individual is a key part of the whole. Information/Computing becomes so complex and huge to comprehend by a single person, yet it is also so simple that anyone can make use of it (for better or for worse). One final thought. When you get to the end and you see what Project 2501 is, think about this: what is a life-form to you? is it necessary for a life-form to have a real-world existence? is it necessary to be carbon-based? would the actual definition of ""life"", that is: - an organism that has a molecule capable of storing information - an organism that grows and reproduces - and organism that keeps a balance with the environmentaccurate enough for the times to come?",Ghost in the Shell
133,Efenstor,Cyberghost wants a cyberchild,6,13 September 2006,"This movie has only one strong side: the very idea of virtual entity dwelling in a network, moreover revolutionary because the movie was made in 1995 when the Internet had only started to evolve. The rest is simply a boring gunpacked action with futile attempts to create a kind of ""bladerunnerish"" atmosphere, futile attempts to develop a kind of cyberphilosophy and as result no character attracts our sympathy as well as any other emotion at all. Still we must thank this anime for inspiring Gabrielle Salvatores to create his truly atmospheric masterpiece ""Nirvana"" which borrows a lot of cyberworld details from the ""Ghost in the Shell"". I must confess that I tried very hard to catch a cyberpunkish vibe in the ""meditative"" parts of the ""Ghost"" but it was barely possible, too much action around these sections totally swiped the sprout of atmosphere away. In Nirvana I got it from the first frames.Conclude: mediocre script with a great core, mediocre direction, tasteless beefy characters, tons of unnecessary nudity, nice visuals and amazing soundtrack. 6 of 10.",Ghost in the Shell

135,josephmpapp,A shell,4,25 February 2017,"The animation in this movie is really good. I've read other commentators who say it isn't good, but I think that's wrong. It has a lot of memorable visuals and beautifully executed animations. The design of the movie is similar to the design of ""Blade Runner."" Where the movie fails is in its story and dubbing. The voice actors for this film aren't as good as what you would get from other animated series like ""Kabanari of the Iron Fortress"" or ""Batman the Animated Series"" It's a little closer to the Animated X-Men Cartoon of the 90's. That doesn't work so well in the film and its hard to ignore.The story is the other issue. There are a lot of jump starts to philosophical questions that never get answers or consideration. The movie throws these ideas out to make the film seem profound. Unfortunately, that doesn't pan out. You don't get answers. Opinions on the subject aren't addressed and it comes off about as deep as the conversation between Neo and the Architect. It's drivel used to make the cyberpunk universe look deep when it's nothing more that an action flick with pretty colors.If you like to see great animation, this movie does that.

138,SteveRaccoon,Disappointingly lacking in content,5,24 February 2004,"Having owned this movie on both DVD and VHS, I have to say it remained one of my least watched movies until I admitted to myself that I didn't want to watch it again - sell!Whilst watching this movie for the last time, I tried to link up the plot devices to make a tangible journey, and failed. On top of that, the parts of the film which are supposed to add flesh to the characters and suck you into the oppressive atmosphere just don't WORK.The visuals are gorgeous, yes, but then the same could be said for most modern console games, I wouldn't want to sit and stare at those for an hour and a half either. Talking of visuals, the film makers seem to have an obsession with disrobing the main character at every verse end. That's a pity, since it lowers the tone of the movie needlessly. The Major isn't exactly anime totty either, miserable monotone cyborg as a pin-up? Naaaah..Technology has a major part to play in this film, probably more so than any individual character. That's unfortunate, since the flat dialogue between the characters doesn't bring any of it to life. (That's a strange sentence, but it's a little difficult to put into words). Perhaps this is a better way: It's like sci-fi buffs who rant on about fictional technology in series like Star Trek. At the end of the day, the technology isn't what it's about, it's the characters who make the entire thing worth watching. Worrying about what warp-factor 5 or whatever actually 'is' means that you've missed the point entirely.So with that in mind, we have all this business about what defines a human being, what defines life and what ethical problems are created by scientific advances. In this case the internet, IT and artificial intelligence are all bundled up and thrown at humanity's slow-to-adapt ethics. Great, wonderful, lovely... if you were faced with a script which can deliver that whilst getting to know the characters, keeping the film interesting and leaving you satisfied with the outcome - GITS fails quite miserably on those fronts.The conversations between the two main players delivered nothing more than a couple of minutes worth of brain-tickling. They struck me as simply being miserable as opposed to 'deep'. At these points of the film I've been sorely tempted to hit F-FWD.The action sequences are well done, but there's only a couple of them and they're short-lived. Then we're stuck with another long sequence of events which add-up to little.The ending hit the buffers rather than wound down the movie. Either an uplifting final note or something chilling would have been .. nice? Instead I found myself gawping at the credits and wondering why on earth nobody came up with something better.Most of the above thoughts have come around after actually mulling over the goings-on in the film some time after last watching it. At first I enjoyed watching the film, but after digging deeper and looking at what the message was the whole thing just unravelled. Going deeper with the anime medium is great, but it shouldn't get in the way of the film's flow. Couple that with a message which is neither original or particularly valid at this point in time, what could've been a corking film is instead boring and disjointed. Less talk about electronic gimmicks (who cares? How did it add to the film?), less monotone self-pity from the lead chara and a few more action seens would have gone a long way.More anime thrillers, horrors and sci fi like this would be most welcome. In my opinion though, this film has had too much praise nailed to it and is one to rent and enjoy a few times before the flaws begin to bug you.",Ghost in the Shell
139,roundtablet,beautiful and deep,10,10 June 2018,"Ghost in the shell tries to show a realistic depiction of the future where humans are able to modify their brains and connect them in a huge network, pretty much like the internet, and like the internet nowadays it becomes mandatory for everyone living in this world to be able to connect to each other. The world around GitS is very complex and interesting, and will fascinate you in its own way, showing you not only the bright ideas of this future, but also its dirty sides, the hacking of another mind, the deleting of someone's memory, things connected to hacking-problems people face today and exactly that makes this movie so relatable even over 20 years of its release.
And besides presenting you this futuristic world in this movie many fundamental questions appear, which go deeper into the thematic of what is life itself, since it is possible to create artificial intelligence. The movie also has a lot of well-made action scenes. They are not really the main focus of the movie but succeed in creating tension.
The soundtrack of this movie is as well phenomenal, with a combination of traditional Japanese instruments and voices, the music in this movie is so unique and gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.
The Art style of Ghost in the Shell impresses its audience with one of the most detailed backgrounds with very beautiful drawn skyscrapers, technical detail of the machines, weapons and especially the robots are amazing. The artstyle was influenced very much but movies like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Akira"", which both look gorgeous as well.
So in conclusion GitS gives you a whole package of a very dark and mature futuristic world and its ideas. Its based on a combination of very deep and meaningful conversations, dark and very beautiful art style and entertaining combat, doing a great job in all of these.",Ghost in the Shell

141,yv_es,"A visually stunning, albeit rather empty, anime classic",6,4 January 2021,"There is no doubt that Ghost in the Shell is an anime classic. However does Ghost in the Shell still hold up in the distance future of 2021? Well, I guess it depends.The visual design most certainly does. The background art is especially stunning. Its futuristic yet gritty city feels alive and tactile. The entire film a is great example of the Cyberpunk aesthetic, and watching it today you can clearly see its influence on many later directors. My only criticism of the visual design is that it definitely reflects a male gaze in a way that does not seem self aware.Compared with the design however, the animation leaves something to be desired. There are drawn out still shots that linger for quite a long time and long sequences where only a character's mouth moves. This of course is not uncommon in older anime, but it feels cheap even by 90s anime standards. Thankfully you'll usually be busy enough looking at the amazing background art and other design that you can overlook this.For me, the larger disappointment was that the plot and characters are rather basic. The film touches on a number of interesting philosophical topics, such as the nature of consciousness and what it means to be human, without exploring them in any depth or offering any real insights. I find that even bad cyberpunk films, such as 1995's Strange Days, to be much more intellectually interesting.I was also disappointed by how underdeveloped the characters are. Major Motoko has pretty much one line where she talks about herself and doubting her identity. Her partner is basically just the muscle. This underdevelopment makes it difficult to care about them or what's going on in the film. Even the ending feels very low stakes.All told, Ghost In the Shell is undoubtably an anime classic. Visually it more than holds up today, although adult viewers may find it disappointingly shallow in terms of exploring larger concepts and developing characters. Compared to other anime work from the mid 90s, such as ""Memories"" or many other OVAs, I don't think Ghost In the Shell is quite as revolutionary as some make it out to be, although I do love its cyberpunk aesthetic and do appreciate how influential it was.Part of the problem with watching Ghost in the Shell today is that anime has evolved a lot since 1995. While this film once passed as a groundbreaking work for adults, today I can't help but feel it is not an entirely mature work. All of which is to say that while Ghost In the Shell isn't a bad film by any stretch, in my opinion it's been somewhat eclipsed by the universe of anime it and its ilk helped spawn.",Ghost in the Shell

143,Richie-33,Not your average anime,9,18 January 2001,"This thoughtful anime is a meditation on the meaning of consciousness disguised as action sci-fi. The checklist of futuristic Japanese animations is dutifully adhered to, however the requisite guns, tanks and robots are used sparingly and provide a backdrop to a more cerebral storyline.In a futuristic Japan, cyborg augmentation is commonplace, leaving many questions concerning what is the definition that qualifies humanity. What starts as an investigation into a mysterious computer wizard hacking into peoples electronically enhanced brains quickly escalates into political intrigue between government sections and a race against time to discover exactly who the hacker is before he is killed. The quality of the animation is superb throughout and is combined with computer graphics to great effect, with the optic camouflage brilliantly realised, notably in the two spectacular action scenes which bookend the main story development, one involving a chase through a crowded market and the other a tense standoff between the lead character and a typically insectoid tank.There are nice touches throughout (look out for the director's strange predilection for beagles), especially the scuba diving scene laden with rebirth symbolism. The plot is overly complicated at points (in fact I needed a repeat viewing to sort out exactly what happened), several characters seem to be mentioned in passing and later become important and I found I initially lost track of who was being referred to. If you aren't paying attention right from the first scene, you may well find yourself (like me) getting a bit lost towards the end. However, I think the premise of A.I. and consciousness was a fascinating one and found the film pleasantly deep. Credit must also be given to the writers for imbuing the lead roles with depth and in Major Kusunagi providing possibly the strongest female character I have seen in film.",Ghost in the Shell
144,knoxfan2008,"Good, but nothing too special",5,30 April 2017,"I, (I guess) controversially, don't think this film is that great. The dialogue is pretty stilted, same with the shots and characters, the music is experimental and interesting but not used appropriately at times (there are moments that would be so effective, if only they cut out the music and allowed the scene to be silent, something they accomplish well during the last fight of the film). Certain shots are gorgeous, but it doesn't take advantage of the medium as well as so many other Anime. The themes are interesting, yet the delivery of them is all in an exposition monologue dump at the end, so it doesn't provoke much of a response throughout. The Blade Runner similarities are really heavy and blatant, and not just the style but the story as well. Side Note: I couldn't find the original language version with subs, so I had to watch the English dub, and the voice actors they got were really bland . Good film, but not sure why it's considered one of the best Anime ever. I think it's because its one of the first Anime to get a lot of western attention since this was '95 and all.

Focusing on the near future and questioning what it means to exist in a world where computerization was becoming more and more prevalent and capitalism was dominant, cyberpunk found its voice early with the works of Phillip K. Dick, but would really shine with the novels of William Gibson and Neal Stephenson. Cyberpunk is a genre that is less explored than certain other ""-punks"" if only because the main themes have been done to death and the entire genre focuses on tropes that can go over the heads of the general movie-going populace. Smart science fiction isn't exactly what audiences are pining for so even when we are given a rare cyberpunk film in this modern age, they tend to be overblown blockbusters focusing more on action and style than actual commentary or philosophizing.Ghost in the Shell is an animated film and one of a handful of anime films that have showcased that the medium is not just about the more sexually exploitative or comedic cartoons being released every year, but can also be used to produce high quality mature entertainment. It's a critical darling in the United States, something rare for a non-Ghibli release.While the film gives in to philosophy and the plot is heavy on the technological mumbo-jumbo, at its core Ghost in the Shell is an action film. We are focused on Section 9, an elite group of counter-terrorism agents in Tokyo around the year 2030. The assault team is led by a fully cyberized woman named Motoko Kusanagi and she's backed up by a number of individuals of various levels of cyberization. She faces off against a mysterious hacker known as the Puppet Master, a person with the ability to erase the memories of cyberized people or even take over their bodies for himself.The action is quick, fierce, and extremely well animated. The vast majority of the action comprises of shoot outs, with the final battle against a bipedal tank being the standout scene of the film. Through it all we're given moments of quiet reflection, long sequences of Motoko looking around the city or discussions about whether she died after she became a cyborg. The questions of who we are and when we cease to be human are poignant and add a psychological horror element to the affair. Toward the end of the movie, as Motoko battles the tank, there's a misstep, in my opinion, in the use of an genealogical tree motif on the wall of the battleground. I understand what they were going for in using this, but it feels quite overt in comparison to the rest of the philosophizing.The final fifteen minutes are focused on Puppet Master and Motoko conversing, discussing becoming one and death. It's a fitting, thought provoking finale.Of course, I've skipped over quite a bit of story elements. There's a departmental feud between Section 6 and Section 9 that plays a huge role, as well as some broader politics, all of which enhance the world-building. This is a meaty movie, and though I do categorize it as an action flick in many senses, it is action with a purpose. While this site will continue to showcase action films that are seemingly purposeless aside from displaying violence, Ghost in the Shell is one of the rare instances where both action and inaction work together to tell a story that all science fiction and action fans need to see.",Ghost in the Shell

It is a Japanese Anime but plays out as if it is a live action movie. The production values are top-notch, the action is intense, the story intricate, and the characters complex.*** Possible Spoilers ***The only drawback for this movie is that some of the concepts are so advanced that the average user won't be able to grasp all that is going on in one viewing. At the same time the director spends too much time lingering on the animated breasts of the main character which lessons the credibility of the film. At points the genious of the film is cheapened by the gratuitous soft-core T and A content.This is an R rated film that will appeal to young adult male computer hackers and sci-fi fans who accept that, in the future, it will be commonplace for people to be mentally and physically augmented, that your brain can be hacked, and that computers can become self- aware.There is one scene where a criminal is apprehended by special law enforcement agents. The agents comment on how sad it is when someone's brain has been hacked and they no longer know who they are and that they have been used as a pawn by the real criminal behind this person's actions; The Puppet Master. The plot is intricate and requires the viewer to pay attention or you'll end up wondering what it's all about. Overall an excellent effort and a must-see for anime/sci-fi fans.",Ghost in the Shell
148,rafael_jaramillo_avellan,Sci-fi Anime and Cyberpunk meet again to create an absolute masterpiece.,9,14 April 2017,"A must-see film for Sci-fi, Anime and Cyberpunk fans. Even though you are not a fan of any of those, I can assure your curiosity will let you enjoy it. I will dedicate this review to recommend the 1995 film, and why I don't recommend the 2017 remake. Both movies are aesthetically visual, but the difference between this two beautiful ""shells"", is the very ""ghost"" within. I'll try to be brief, but with enough content about both. So, let's go:1995: (9/10)We were presented to a thought-provoking and question-rising plot, where there are intrigue and political complot; it takes us on a tour about the relationship between environment and character (aspect-to-aspect sequences). Motoko Kusanagi is the center of the rising questioning about humanity, identity, and memory. What means to be human in a world were human functioning has become more mechanical and technological (read: ""Ship of Theseus"")? If our brains and conscience (ghost) can be ""hacked"", how do we know if we are living in the real world (direct influence for ""The Matrix"" - 1999)?Also, our main ""villain"", the Puppet Master: A self-aware Artificial Intelligence (AI) whose desire to evolve and be impermanent is the engine for this story. One of the most complex and well-developed characters ever, he is the reference for philosophy, Buddhism and transcendent questions that made this movie, an instant classic.2017: (5/10)We are presented to a plot that follows one direction: vengeance. As the trailer shows us: it is about identity theft and making the responsible pay for it. After that, there ain't much more to it. Our main character's only question is why she feels something has been taken from her. Our main ""villain"", Kuze, follows the same formulaic goal of taking revenge against those who made him what he is. For real, that's basically it: no depth, American clichés, even the action feels flat.",Ghost in the Shell
149,peamorrortu,Impressive and nuanced science-fiction exercise.,10,28 July 2020,"I won't extend too much on this one, since I think it is better for anyone that is interested in the movie to go and watch it themselves, but I will say that Ghost in the Shell lives up to the expectatives and ends up being a very solid science-fiction movies. I am not familiar with the manga or the anime series, but I hadn't any problem with following up the story, so the writers did a pretty good job and achieved a movie that stand on its on feet. The film presents us with a grim, somber future, which doesn't seem so far from ours anymore: massive industralisation and technological developments, AI and climate change have driven civilization to a future that isn't overtly distopical, but it ends up being an scenario that leaves the viewer with an uneasy sensation of incertitude (the music really helps out hear, and the panoramic shoot work perfectly for setting the mood and expanding world and atmosphere alike), and sucessfully rises many questions.The open ending and the nuanced and ambigous approach the movie takes towards the themes it chooses to tackle (which contrasts with the more conventionally explotational elements like nudity and violence, that, even if may be out of place sometimes, don't end up tainting the movie as a whole and adequeately integrate in the general picture) leaves everyone wondering about the consquences the future the movie presents has for humanity as a whole, for life, death, identity, and a long etc. Many viewers would probably relate to the protagonist's feelings of lack of identity and emptiness, setting aside the fact that she is a superhuman cyborg. Overall, a good example of how you should present a sci-fi, gradually revealing plot elements to keep the reviewer interested, slowly expanding on its premises, hinting at ideas but with rubbing them on one's nose (which many animes do in the form of exposition) and leaving room up for reflection and intepretation. Would certainly reccomend. I was doubting between a 9 and a 10, but I must hand it to the film creators here, they did a pretty good job.",Ghost in the Shell
150,theowlofthegame,This movie is art,10,4 December 2012,"Well, where do I start? Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art.I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going.At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it: I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind :-) Enjoy the movie!",Ghost in the Shell

Now, an unknown hacker called the Puppet Master has found a way to break the firewall and hack the human mind.Strengths: One of the few pieces of Anime to come out of Japan that doesn't involve ninjas or space-monsters. Crisp, detailed drawing of a quality rarely seen in animation (I've watched the scene of the heroine riding the ferry in the rain a dozen times, and I swear each raindrop is unique). It's good sci-fi and great action.Weaknesses: There's this running theme about identity in the movie, which has potential to make it a deeper story than an action flick. However, like much anime, you can't help but feel much was lost in the translation. The combination of the characters talking really fast (a by-product, I assume, of trying to express concepts that take more words in English than Japanese) and somewhat literal translations of complex ideas makes me really wish I spoke Japanese to get the full effect.Still, a strong and fun piece of animation.

Wake up, folks, film is a visual medium.As visually stunning as this film is, the animation looks about like it did when they made ""Speed Racer.""  There's a lot more detail per frame, but the characters' mouths do not match the dialog, not by a mile (yes, I watched it in Japanese).  It's also very choppy (10-12 frames per second).

The setting and theme of the movie is really cool, and is excellent sci-fi, but the pacing of the movie leaves a lot to be desired.
The movie moves really slow in the beginning, but gets really fast by the end, so much so that around 80% of the plot is in the last half of this film. The pacing issues probably come from the fact that this is an adaptation of a longer manga, so the movie feels like a rushed, high production version of what could be an entire season of a tv show.That being said, the acting is pretty good, even in the dub, and if you don't mind a lot of nudity, its a great watch.",Ghost in the Shell

It isn't fair to compare a book with a film, as they are different mediums and we should not compare the two, because of the difference in strengths and weaknesses. In this case the idea of the story is close enough that you can't keep your mind off it. Ghost in the Shell is not structured to be able to keep up with the depth of the portrayed concepts. Either, you would need to have more screen time (83 minutes is not enough) or have different volumes of one story rather than sequels. The other option would be to simplify the story, which in this case Mamoru Oshii tried to do and failed to an extent. But, I loved the atmosphere and the music in the film.

A visually very amazing movie. The action scenes were brilliant, the artwork well done. And the plot was very good too. All in all it was like watching a James Cameron movie.

The setting and concepts were developed beautifully as well. The storyline was engaging, if not confusing at times. This is a movie that is action-filled but also makes you think, much like the Matrix (which was heavily influenced by it).It has some sore spots, though. My main problem with it was that the plot was too short-- not much happened over the course of the movie. It was as if the movie gets us excited and interested but doesn't carry through by developing the plot further. I plan on watching the sequel to it, because I think that may be the only way to get satisfaction from the storyline. If I were to watch this film and not watch its sequel, it would be like watching the introduction and some of the body of a movie without ever getting to see its conclusion.I didn't much like the soundtrack. It didn't seem to match the setting at all. Rather than be intense and futuristic, it was a simple high-pitched instrument of some sort, fit more for a horror or thriller film than a futuristic action anime flick. The Matrix's soundtrack was the right type of sound for a film like this, not annoying string arrangements.Overall, this was good, though.

159,Ryuji-2,A beautiful masterpiece of ironies,10,29 April 1999,"GITS is a storm of ironies.  First, the plot criticizes the very advanced computer technology used to create the film.  Its mature themes (nudity and violence) all have relevance, yet draw hordes of immature viewers who end up disappointed by a deeply thoughtful social critique.  And as high-tech as it is, the science it probably explores most deeply is anthropology.Cinematically, it's a masterpiece.  The alliance of Kawai's music (Blue Seed), Kawamori's mechs (Macross Plus), and Oshii's directing meld to create stunningly beautiful work transcending their ""Patlabor"" movies.  Its quality and detail make Disney's best look like laughably tasteless scribbles, even though GITS cost a scant $4 million. Oshii's political themes and ""still life"" sequences are trademark, but to those with no stomach for his tastes, I argue his creative license is a fair compromise for compiling a LONG-running manga into a gripping, self-contained movie.  ""Akira"" is a lot less successful in this aspect.Watch this movie subtitled.  The emotion-starved melancholy Tanaka tastefully infuses in Motoko's voice cannot be replaced with a third-rate American voice actress.  Anyone smart enough to understand this movie is smart enough to read, anyway.

161,Luke-Walker,The manga for the masses.,10,30 July 2002,"This is the most beautiful film i've ever seen.There, i've said it. Watch it and be awed at how amazingly detailed and fluid the whole film is. Never does it falter in the art department. The colours are just right, the peoples movements are so real its scary, and sometimes the strong story of the film cant fit all this beauty in and so it releases it entirely in a magical scene in the middle of the film with no dialogue and no plot progression, just marvellous panoramic followed by marvellous panoramic shot. This is my favourite segment of the movie. It shows the nameless city in which the protagonists exist as a cluttered, enclosed, claustrophobic world, yet terrifyingly familiar. This film is full of such themes which subtly make their way into your mind and you dont even realise they're there until afterwards.So lets talk about the story. Its an amazing monster of a tale, squeezing it all in barely in its short running time. It does sometimes feel a little rushed, a little convoluted so that it bears repeat viewings to get the whole thing, but it is still a strong story none the less. In fact it is a very mature story. The creators could have so easily gone the typical manga route and thrown in some invading demons or mega-destructive internet monsters. But no, the whole thing restrains intself to a realistic view of an extra-ordinary situation. it all feels like this is exactly how it would happen in real life, and that is what makes it so engaging, and so scary.This film deserves to be seen, not just because the heavenly beauty warrants it, but because the deep issues it raises needs to be questioned. If you want to be entertained without thinking, watch Wicked City or the countless millions of other mediocre mangas out there. You want to be entertained and be made to think and question the film?

There's a reason Spielberg said it was one of the most imaginative speculative fiction worlds he's ever seen on screen.The first 15 minutes are hard as heck to follow, but stick with it. The story throws you in with a bunch of sci-fi concepts and terms unique to its universe, but you'll learn them quickly (like a Gibson novel).The film has very unique expository dialogue: many times the characters explain concepts to each other that they should already be familiar with, but you realize quickly it's really just unique 4th wall breaking style to help the audience understand and dive into the universe more easily.Feels infinitely rewatchable due to complex plot, themes, and stunning drawings. You can set your home speakers to something ambient and just sit back and chill and watch scenes of the city and be mesmerizing by the art direction and care taken on each frame. Love how there was a 7 minute sequence in the middle devoted to just this. Great directing that soaks us into the universe and acts a well deserved plot break from all the complexity.Perfect finale conversation... when the singularity comes we will undoubtly react like the police woman, who clings intuitively to wanting to keep her 'self', but as eastern tradition has known for centuries, and as the omniscient AI understands here, we don't have one to give up in the first place.

163,haarryi,Extraordinary,10,15 November 2015,"One of the best movies I have ever scene. The philosophical and existential dilemma the main character is going through in the movie is superbly developed. The way the whole plot unravels and the lack of inhibition shown in portraying nudity was a refreshing change. All the main characters are well developed and rounded. The things that fascinated me the most were the philosophical undertones, background score/songs and the city. The background score and songs bring in a haunted feel to the whole movie. A sort of savoury depressing, haunted feel. That gelled very well with the overall feel of the movie. It also complimented the city the movie is set in. I would say the city is one of the major characters in the movie. It's enormous, old, decaying, alive and filthy. It is a representative of the ugly face of the world, that everyone would rather ignore but it refuses to go away. The city is so overwhelming that at times you even start smelling it.

164,nbarlow,Manga at it's very best,8,28 March 2005,"I'd heard the Matrix borrowed several elements from this movie - having seen it now i would say that's something of an understatement. Both films are highly stylised action movies that attempt to cram in some philosophy. But while Ghost In The Shell also addresses the main question asked in the Matrix (""what is reality?"") it also asks some more interesting questions( ""what does it mean to be human? to be alive?""), and though it is occasionally heavy-handed, it is more successful in making you think.To be brutally honest, most Manga i've seen (with the notable exception of 'Akira') looks kinda cheap due to the somewhat jerky animation. However, though the style of animation is the same here, the artwork is breathtaking - in the evocation of a rain-soaked futuristic city, the choice of camera angles, and the stylised use of light and shadow. The music is also superb, and the sometimes languid pace of the movie feels like a benefit rather than a problem.As with virtually all movies, watch the non-dubbed version if possible. However, the occasionally clunky translation and second-rate voice acting in the dubbed version can't spoil a classic piece of animation.",Ghost in the Shell

The movie is not so much a sci-fi action thriller, but more of a intelligent, phsycological thriller! And too be honest, I didn't completely understand the movie (because believe me, ITS CONFUSING) but I still found the movie excellent and a masterpiece of the anime genre! But lets talk about the other good aspects of the film! The animation is great (especially for a movie from 1995!), and the CGI! ITS B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L-! And kicks modern CGI's ass!

It's like an adult sci-fi philosophical picture book, only the pictures have lips that move and occasionally something blows up. There are long periods where you're just looking at a still picture with flapping lips. I personally don't mind this too much, but at least in that other movie Akira they bothered animating people's faces completely when they talked. But the actual story, that is the thing that these pictures are flapping their lips about, is really quite good, but it's pretty much impossible to follow the first time through, particularly if you're just listening to the dub. There are some really striking sequences, many of them involving the main robo-girl wearing very little, and at least one five minute stretch where nothing happens plot-related and we just get to look at stuff, and unfortunately none of it belonging to the main robo-girl. For an 80 minute movie, I think it feels too long and too short. Too long because it seems to feel the need to just show off its detail and bring whatever momentum there is to a standstill a few times, and too short because it's freaking AWESOME!Yes, in spite of whatever qualms I have listed, the movie is, frankly, pretty awesome. The only thing that really sucks about it is that I can't fantasize about the main robo-girl without remembering she has no sexual organs. It's the most philosophical movie to ever have naked girls making people's heads explode within the first five minutes--which in itself is pretty philosophical.",Ghost in the Shell
169,mbficas,"A Beautiful, Unique and Philisophical Masterpiece of Cyberpunk Animation",10,3 March 2021,"Ghost in the Shell is brilliant in all the ways that matter and a few that don't.The animation is top of the line, with gritty backgrounds that make a grungy cyberpunk setting come to life. Every backalley, garbage truck interior, luxurious dwelling, and secretive government office feels distinct from everything else while also being grounded. No place is overly dirty, but rather wears its burden of neglect. Everything has character, and the character everything has is believable. There is a special attention paid to put immense amounts of detail into every bit of technology shown. Car designs look futuristic but plausible for a world quite similar to ours in many ways. Guns are shown very similar to those of our time and reality, which makes the crazier, high tech weaponry used towards the end of the film believable. The cinematography is masterful as well, from a breathtaking opening shot to an imagination capturing end shot. Certain shots have special artifacts to represent digital distortions or the perspective of a character looking through their own augmented zoomed in vision. These are used infrequently enough to make the filters notable and special when used. It is not a technique that wears out its welcome, although it does take some time to grow accustomed to. Every scene wears the impressive effort and artistry of masters of animation. Nothing is lazy. Everywhere are there new things to notice on successive watches of the movie. Personally, after ten or so times watching Ghost in the Shell through, I've noticed multiple unique details within the art that heighten the sense of the world being real and lived in on my most recent viewing.The pacing ensures the film is never boring. Every scene shuffles your attention neatly onto the next wonderful thing the film wants to show you, or the next philosophical idea it wants to broach, or the next action sequence it wants to pay off on the tension it has built. With a runtime of one hour and thirty minutes, the film is short by modern standards and it wastes not a single moment of the audience's time. This is despite the fact the film takes time to build ambience. At the halfway point of the movie, there is an intermission of sorts. No dialogue, just a journey down a canal as a rainy evening fades into the depths of night. The main character, Mokoto Kusanagi, takes a ferry home and spies an exact copy working in an office nearby. Garbage floats in small islands in the waters. Schoolchildren run along a nearby street beneath yellow umbrellas. Out of use cyborg shells, again identical copies of the main character in appearance, display clothing in storefronts. It's a competent and unorthodox decision to trade time that could have been spent on action or character building, and use it instead for building up the world of the film to a further level of realism than most films ever achieve even with longer runtimes or the benefit of being set in our real world.The characters are all likeable. The main character is very capable and elite, but internally conflicted. Her two government agent partners both get a pleasingly balanced amount of time spent on them to ensure they don't feel left out of the plot after being introduced. The head of Sector 9, the government office Mokoto works for, has a unique and strange role in the story that is on a completely different trajectory from the main character's arc, and serves to bring international and national intrigue into the film. Then there's the villain, who I won't spoil. Suffice it to say, despite being in only half the film, he has an overwhelming buildup and presence that ties the entire movie together from start to finish.To keep the audience interested, the film has great action and pleasing nudity. This sounds cheap, like a writer lazily wanted to explore philosophy with his philosophy degree but also wanted a screenplay that wouldn't dive and so threw in the bare minimum of filler. This is far, far from what is on display in Ghost in the Shell. The action is a core part of the narrative. The main character and her colleagues are cyborgs built to do combat specifically to handle dangerous threats like the ones they face in the film, so it makes sense, but more than that, it helps the pacing rather than hindering it or overriding it. As for the nudity, uh, I think the main character's camouflage requires her to be nude or something, or maybe it has some further meaning I'm too dumb to understand. The movie's maybe a little dumb with the nudity but that's fine because it looks pretty and it doesn't actively hinder the movie. It walks the line between boring-smart and dumb-fun to be the sort of film that really fills your head with a few new ideas while you have a great time.All in all, Ghost in the Shell has no fundamental issues, except for being hard to follow for the first watch. I plead with all my heart for you to watch it once, and if you don't understand it enough to enjoy it while watching it, to watch it again so you can follow it easier. This is a film that truly does reward picking it apart, and its complexity is not all for show. With each viewing, the twists become bigger, and the action scenes gain a new sense of weight as the ending becomes legendary in its implications for the characters involved. There is a line I'm particularly fond of from the film. ""All the information we accumulate in a lifetime is just a drop in the bucket."" You will only be able to watch so many films in your lifetime, and I assure you, you will be glad this was one of them.As a final note, watch the subtitled version rather than the English dub. It's a much better experience.",Ghost in the Shell
170,pipin_ferreras,Thought provoking film with superb visual style and music,10,4 January 2017,"Ghost in the Shell (1995) is one of the best manga to anime movie transfers of all time and director Mamoru Oshii had great material to work with from the original artist, Masamune Shirow.It is Shirow who came up with a rather complex, but accessible and rewarding story about the emergence of AI in a future world of extreme interconnection and cyborgization. GitS deals with what it means to be human when your very conscience can be uploaded or high-jacked, and your body is 100% machine except for your brain. To that end, it takes a cue from eastern philosophy and the result is probably the deepest meditation on the subject ever put to film.However, the movie is much more than that. The world building is phenomenal and Oshii takes his time to present the city through the use of a few exquisite silent sequences that only use music. There are also strong action scenes to satisfy anyone who likes mecha.Obviously, the anime cannot address all the various themes and subjects of the manga, but it gets the main points right and it does the most it can. It is a creative transfer that does the material justice and together with the fantastic eerie music by Kenji Kawai, it constitutes a solid 10/10 rating from me.",Ghost in the Shell
171,smccallister,"the bridge between ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix""",9,24 October 2004,"from the curtain of green zeros and ones out of which the credits emerge, to the cyborgs and mirage of implanted memories, ""Ghost in the Shell"" is a vital link in the chain of the best science fiction films, linking ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix"". The smart, fast moving plot, philosophical undertones of what it means to be human, and the stunning animation of urban scenes add up to a great film. There's a lot of action here, but the plot is complex enough that it keeps your mind working, too. The film was released in 1995 at the beginning of the Internet boom (albeit well into the cyberpunk era), it would be understandable if the film hadn't aged well over the last decade. But it looks, if anything, better today.",Ghost in the Shell
172,harmony-8,A meditation on personal identity.,9,20 July 1999,I was captivated by the main character's musing on her personal identity: who am I?; am I human or merely a machine?; what makes an individual an identifiably individuated person?

174,AThames,"A beautiful, hypnotic movie with an original plot",9,24 July 2013,"When you look up animé movies, two movies will repeatedly get mentioned - Akira and Ghost In The Shell. And with good reason. This movie was a lot better than I had anticipated. I was expecting something like a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider kind of movie, but this was something else, thankfully. The year is 2029. The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth.This movie (directed by Mamoru Oshii) was the movie that was supposed to bring the animé genre to the western audience, it failed at that, and I can understand why. Like the movie Cloud Atlas, this movie quickly becomes more complex than your average action flick and I think that this turns a lot of people off. The movie starts of as an action movie, but it quickly turns into a more philosophical piece. I was actually pretty intrigued by some of the movies philosophical questions, which I am not going to analyze in this review, but the main topic is; What makes a human? and more importantly, what makes a human an individual? The animation was good, though it is funny to see how much animé styles change for each decade. You can just compare Ghost In The Shell (1995) with Ghost In The Shell 2 (2004) to notice the difference.The voice acting was also very good (I watched the Japanese version as I hate dubs, but some say that they also like the English version) I would also really like to give a shoutout Kenji Kawai(the music composer), this guy is awesome at making soundtracks. The cinematographer (Hisao Shirai) in this movie also does an awesome job, though I am not familiar with any of his other movies. Kenji Kawai and Hisao Shirai really elevates this movie to something else. The shots of the post-apocalyptic city along with the very haunting soundtrack was very intense. My only complaint about the movie is that I don't think it was long enough. It runs for 1:22 including credits, and there is definitely not any time wasted. The plot moves very fast, and so does the dialogue, which I thought was a shame because some of the dialouge really needed to sink in (for me at least), but it then quickly moves on to the next scene. Imo, this movie could have been a lot better with a running time of ~2 hours. Where we could have seen more of the city, and learned more about the status of the world which the movie only covers briefly. I don't know if the short running time is a deliberate choice made by the director, or if it is a matter of budget issues. I believe it is the latter, it is a little bit like (though not nearly as bad) as the new Berserk movies, in which they really amped up the animation quality, but they have also slaughtered more than 50% of the story that was in the original manga and anime. Overall great action, great animation, great voice acting, really great soundtrack, very nice cinematography, but a little too short imo. I highly recommend.",Ghost in the Shell

Someone known only as the Puppet Master has been hacking into peoples brains gaining control of them; allowing him to commit crimes, using his victims as drones.There's a number of quotes that the viewer must think through before continuing on with the movie.

176,kylehaynes31,Quick and short mini-review,9,29 June 2013,"Both of Oshii's main GitS movies are extremely stylish and enjoyable, but there is a LOT of really uncalled for nudity in this one. The GitS movies revolve around the concept that there are very human-like robots and cyborgs that inhabit the earth and that they have souls, called Ghosts, that inhabit their outer robot shells. These Ghosts can not only communicate with each other telepathically, but can switch shells, go on the equivalent of the internet, and be hacked, thus changing the reality that they experience. This movie follows a team of the once-organic female Major Kusanagi and the male Batou cyborg/robots as they track down a Ghost hacker called the ""Puppet Master"". Good times are had by all, the visuals have aged very well and still look better than a lot of what's currently out there. A must-see for anime movie fans.",Ghost in the Shell
177,Hopper-2,Important science fiction,10,30 March 2001,"Ghost in the Shell is a visually stunning animated masterpiece. Japanese animation has always been in a class of its own, so I won't even attempt to describe the incredible attention to detail and beautiful imagery in this movie. In this case the animation is merely icing for what is one of the most important works of science fiction in recent years.Every generation has had books and movies that have contributed to our collective understanding of reality. Prior to World War II this included books like Yevgeny Zamyatin's ""We"" and Huxley's ""Brave New World"", and later Orwell's ""1984"". Today most warnings about the future fall into the category of science fiction. Science fiction began to fill this role when Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001"" warned us of the potential for humanity to create intelligent, even sentient computers that could murder their human creators. ""2001"" envisioned computer intelligence imprisoned in the physical body of a computer. Where ""2001"" left off, Ghost in the Shell begins.Ghost in the Shell tells the story of a future in which a computer program, Project 2501, becomes self-aware and begins a quest to fill basic needs it feels are qualifiers of being alive by controlling computers and people to achieve its ultimate goals. Whereas the HAL-9000 computer was relatively harmless, owing to its confinement in the Odyssey space ship, Project 2501 is a recognition that the global internet could have dire consequences for all of us. By comparison, this new villain is virtually invincible. But is Project 2501 a villain?Most people who have told me that they didn't like this move said that they didn't understand it. Indeed, the story and concepts are very complicated. I have watched it several times and still get new things out of it every time. Roger Ebert called Ghost in the Shell, ""Unusually intelligent and challenging science fiction, aimed at smart audiences"".Ghost in the Shell is full of fascinating dialog, such as this diatribe about the cycle of life and death by Project 2501. ""A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems, and copies do not give rise to variety and originality. Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.""Thus Ghost in the Shell goes beyond simply a prediction or warning for the future: it attempts to contribute to our understanding of reality by breaking existence down into biological terms and making us question, along with the characters in the movie, whether or not any of us has a soul. The characters in Ghost in the Shell are unusually deep and are a refreshing change from the one-dimensional stereotypes we've become numbed by in modern media. Ghost in the Shell would be required reading in many high school and university courses if it weren't for the fortuitous fact that it can be enjoyed in this beautifully animated feature film. This is one of the few movies ever made that everyone should watch at least once.",Ghost in the Shell
178,Yojiro,Oshii does it again!,10,21 June 1999,"I would highly recommend this animated thriller. Kokaku Kidotai (aka ""Ghost in the Shell"") is a breakthrough in animated cinematography, this film has an excellent storyline, high quality animation, and the sound is wonderful. What really makes this film interesting is the realistic characters. By saying this I mean that this kind of animation genre, known as Anime is usually filled with super-hero guys and big breasted girls. Those are the stereotypes of Anime. I think Kokaku Kidotai is right up there with Akira. This film maybe hard to understand at first but you have to keep an open mind and have a sense of imagination. As I said I would recommend this film, even to those who think animation is for kids. I think you will be seeing alot more animated films oriented for an older audiences, I hope at least one person who has read this review will go rent or buy this film.

But, seriously the animation isn't the biggest part of the review, it is the over all story and pleasure taken from watching the movie that is the biggest piece of a review.

However, when I thought about it afterwards, and re-watched it, I realized what people were saying.This movies make you question what is the difference between AI and human.

See the movie and you will see what I mean.There's not just the sex appeal by the way.  There is also a plot of sorts (though that takes second place to the sexiness) and, being Manga, a ""philosophy break"" (you know those bits where they stop the action so someone can get all philosophical or moral, normally at great length), this one thankfully not too long.I love this movie.",Ghost in the Shell

The film shows also the problems with developing a large scale dependency on computers and technology.

Since Ghost in the Shell is one of the titles I had heard the most about, I picked it up.I didn't quite expect the kind of movie I saw. I expected an action movie full of violence, but the movie is mainly calm, pensive, and thought-provoking.You see, in the world of Ghost in the Shell, people have totally embraced ""cyber-additions"" to their bodies.  They upgrade themselves to become smarter, faster, stronger... almost invincible.  But how much flesh must you still have to be considered human? What distinguishes humans from machines now is their ""ghosts"", or souls, which machines can never hope to have.So what we have is a heroine almost completely machine, trying to stop a hacker so good, he can hack into the ghosts of his victims. Who is this mysterious hacker, and why does he seem to pursue our heroine?Lot's of philosophical questions are raised here, and I liked the way the author(s) drew a parallel between the cybernetic evolution and the biologic one.The score is fantastic, although I'm not used to oriental music.  The characters' voices seem a little detached, unfortunately.  Still, I consider myself lucky to have discovered this good a film. I definitely recommend it. 9 out of 10.",Ghost in the Shell

This proved for an amazing picture, and the direction was very much like that in ""Blade Runner"".  However, people who have also seen this that didn't like it didn't seem to know what the plot was, which is why Ebert says what he says about this film.  ""Ghost in the Shell"" is the second greatest Anime ever, with ""Akira"" being the first, and ""Princess Mononoke"" being the third.  However, it was just too darn short.When a man who calls himself the Puppet Master unleashes a virus among cyborgs, a lone ghost in a shell is to stop him.So what does ""Ghost in the Shell"" mean?

In my opinion, ghost in the shell is one of the most over-rated of all over-rated anime, and unlike other over-rated anime like Gundam and Dragonball, it doesn't even have any fun parts that make it enjoyable even if you can't stand the plot!  The problem is, apparently, those that made ghost in the shell thought that by having the movie try to be everything, it would make up for the fact that none of its attributes were all that spectacular.   You want to see weird philosophical anime?  Watch ""Serial Experiments laine,"" at least that presents a few semi-original points here and there. You want big gun martial arts action?  See a Chow Yun-fat movie, or any action oriented anime that does it right (robotech, gun smith cats, cowboy bebop, etc.)  The other major problem, I found, was that the movie was WAY to much like William Gibson's ""Neuromancer.""  While I realize that all cyberpunk stories are going to sound like neuromancer until somebody does something to get it a bit more mainstream, I still wish cyberpunk movies like this would do a bit more to be original.Instead of watching this, watch Cowboy Bebop or Serial Experiments Laine.

Yet, the political and social scenario is similar to today's. There are cyborgs who have an artificial/technological body ,human in appearance and brains made like human's.They are physically and mentally more capable and can be plugged in to receive and analyze data. The story follows Major Motoko Kusanagi ,a cyborg working for a national security agency , as she and her team pursue the puppet master a hacker of formidable ability who seems to be planning a crime concerning foreign affairs ,thus involving other departments of the government.It is highly inaccurate to call this an action movie. Though it involves a national security agency it has very little ""action"". The story unfolds like a well paced thriller but that is a very incomplete description. It is a movie for the patient. The scenes in the movie take their time but with good effect. The story and themes are very mature and intellectual but they are well explained .At the same time it is entertaining not the fun kind but the sort that holds u in awe.After seeing this movie i see anime as an art form and this as a masterpiece. The future is well imagined and appears realistic and the cinematography is so creative exploiting the freedom provided by this medium.Layer after layer is added to the story and slowly a cyber-meta- physical aspect enters it staying in the background at first and becoming significant with time.This movie hooks you to story of the future where scenarios similar to present day conditions are handled by advanced technologies but as the story progresses it digs deeper and deeper into the future.This is one of the best movies i have seen but i wont recommend it to everyone, only those who seeking novel mature content.",Ghost in the Shell

Unfortunately, Ghost in the Shell can't.The biggest flaws of Ghost in the Shell are the pace of development and the rushed ending, which pretty much go together hand in hand.  It seems as though the first 70 minutes are devoted to the premise, whereas the heart of the story and the resolution are thrown into the last 10.  Personally, I didn't like the end, but that is more of a matter of taste as opposed to quality.However, these problems shouldn't overshadow the fact that GitS is indeed a good movie worth watching.

Anyway, I cannot truly express my most grand satisfaction and respect for the production I'm feeling now. Maybe it's the way I watch most of the movies, but this time, I've actually scanned through each important fragment that a movie production, an anime in particular, should possess. From the most basic things, like script, dialog, sounds, graphics and the idea - not only does it keep its freshness through all these years but still it enchants by what is most important in a good movie. Those who think it belongs to some underrated category just because it's an anime should be scorched by the wrath of the Alimghty. Anyhow, what's really interesting and essential in this anime is its story, very original and awesomely developed, it's a pity that some countries (including Poland) have some kind of cultural barrier that shallows their artistic horizons and so they do not embrace and glorify the really good pieces of animation art. Instead, we blindly follow primitive fashions brought from the USA.

195,stjones01,A sleek and sexy cyber-punk classic,9,3 April 2012,"Ghost in the Shell (GITS) is an iconic and influential anime (adapted from the manga series). On the surface, it's a sci-fi action flick, but underneath this cool exterior lies a deeply complex storyline, rooted in philosophical ideas such as the relationship between man and machine, the insecurities of mankind, and the things that make humans human.The storyline for GITS is fresh and original. In the year 2029, the world's craving for information is more ravenous than ever. The biggest crimes now take place within the interactive network, where hackers attempt to take control of individuals in the network. The main character, Major Kusanagi, (who bears a resemblance to a more voluptuous version of Luc Besson's ""Nikita"") and her partner, Batô (... Duke Nukem?) hunt the most dangerous hacker in cyber-crime: ""The Puppet-master"". From the first frame to the last, the animation is fluid and stylish, and the artwork focuses on a dull blue color scheme, creating a moody and cold atmosphere that the cyber-punk genre is known for. Character designs are very articulate, particularly Kusanagi's. Half the time, her flawless body is drawn completely naked, or with her skin-tight therm-optic camouflage suit. A lot of thought went in to the creation of her character, and this is not solely concerning her physique. In other animes, characters are drawn blinking in order to humanize them, but throughout GITS Kusanagi will stare off, unblinking. Mamoru Oshii intended to portray her as a ""doll"", and the blank stare conveys that persona. Batô is her loyal sidekick in the story, and serves as a light-hearted character, who seems to be more of a human than a cyborg. To add to the relationship between these characters, they were given names that carry an interesting mythos. ""Kusanagi"" is the sword of the eight-headed beast, Orochi, and ""Batô"" is Mandarin for ""eight-headed"". This added fluff behind the character design gives insight to how seriously Mamoru takes his storytelling. Mamoru is very tasteful in his utilization of intense action sequences. He realized that if he had bombarded the viewer with non-stop no-holds-barred combat and violence throughout the movie, he would have dug himself into a hole--a hole in which he would be incapable of providing an emotionally satisfying climax for the audience. He progresses GITS at a gorgeously slow pace, meticulously placing each intense action sequence in the film's sweet spots. GITS is definitely a thinking man's anime film, and not a mindless fast-paced slug- fest. It instead takes a less conventional approach to it's pacing--an anime of this sophistication demands a tasteful, slow ride up the plot ladder. Music adds substantially to the atmosphere of the film. The mix of the synthetic sounds and the tribal drums help darken the mood. In particular, there is a recurring choral song that seems to haunt Kusanagi in her pursuit of the Puppet-master. This is the core song of the film, and has likely haunted audiences as well--it's gorgeously arranged and repetitive. The English voice-overs are fairly decent for an anime film. Some are appropriately stoic and cold, with the cyborg characters taken into consideration. There are some points when the delivery of some important dialogue ought to be a little more emphasized, but this is a minor complaint that will otherwise go unnoticed with the positives of this film in consideration. While a little rough around the edges, this film is a landmark achievement in the anime world, being one of the first anime features to appeal to non-anime fans. Just like the lovely Kusanagi, GITS is a thing of beauty, from the outside in. 4.5/5",Ghost in the Shell
196,maciek-05892,A masterpiece,10,31 October 2020,"To me it is the best Sci-Fi movie of all times. Surely a breakthrough for the cyberpunk genre, an inspiration to many later classics (I read green letters in the Matrix as tribute to GITS) and a great movie in general. It is not long, hence the plot is rather dense, so you need to stay focused not to get lost. But it is surely worth your attention.
The universe is worked on in finest details and presented in a visually beautiful way, accompanied with magnificent music. Direction keeps balance between action, emotion and universal philosophical questions that are greatly composed into the plot and seem to correspond to spiritual traditions typical of Japan and Orient.
Watch it more than once!",Ghost in the Shell
197,SantiagoDM1,Just a whisper in my spirit.,10,27 May 2019,"Ghost in the Shell tells the story of Major Kusanagi, a member of Sector 9, a private defense organization of the Japanese government to investigate cybercrime. Most of all members of sector 9 have altered their bodies, and have cybernetic augments. Our protagonist has only his physical human brain, the rest of his body is synthetic, what could be considered an android. Other comrades like Batou have cybernetic eyes, with multiple uses, while almost everyone has intracranial radio implants to be able to speak without using a microphone.The post-Third World War society that presents us with the world of Ghost in the Shell, combined with the use of this cybernetic improvement technology of the body for all of society, generates a new vision of humanity. These improvements range from simple implants, entire limbs or improvements to productivity. As for example extendable and quick fingers for the secretariat or stronger arms for weight jobs. These improvements generate the concept that human consciousness is ""bottled"" and refers to it as the ""ghost"", the spectrum.The story itself narrates the investigation of a cyber pirate, called the puppeteer, who is wreaking havoc on section 9 and the government, assaulting the bodies and memories of the people. Without going too far into the spoilers, Major Kusanagi, in her quest to know who she is, develops an intellectual fascination for him.This is the starting point for the reflections that the film proposes later, especially those focused on what defines humanity. Where the barrier between the synthetic, the virtual and the real diffuses. Everything that makes you be you may not be yours.Kusanagi spends the whole film wondering who she is and, in the end, reborn between angel feathers and symbols of resurrection. We find nihilistic metaphors in the motif of the reflections, where Kusanagi tries to glimpse what the real world is and who she is. The film's own presentation is replete with these symbols. Kusanagi emerging from the water and merging with his reflection. This symbology reflects our inability to perceive what is real. Oshii gets the viewer to interpret the abstract as a possible world that appears as real to our eyes, the world we inhabit. As the puppet master explains to Kusanagi that only she can see him through a crystal, but with his fusion She will be able to see clearly. The crystal and the water, the reflections, are poetic expressions of the idea ""we can not know what is real"". They are visual symbols of the epistemological nihilism that appears continuously throughout the film...Ghost in the Shell has left an indelible mark on our cultural history, planting the seed of many ideas in different creators. Perhaps the most important and well-known is Lana and Lilly Wachowski's Matrix, the number lines in green when entering the system, the puppet master can be compared with Agent Smith, with his existentialist reflections, aesthetics and especially the fact of that our minds can be part of a world made entirely of data and consequently stop feeling the ""reality"" that we supposedly perceive.It is truly a feature film that is a visual marvel, but the best way to enter into symbiosis with Ghost in the Shell is to watch the film and be predisposed to our mind merging with the delightful images and transport us to another reality.10/10.",Ghost in the Shell

Ghost in the Shell does what few movies can, it weaves complex characters into a story where no dialogue is pointless and no image is wasted. While the Characters are from a manga, Mamoru Oshii created the film from his mind's eye and is not simply recreating the manga through film. The thematic material is mainly existentialism and evolution, however Oshii dabbles (as he usually does) in religion. Ghost in the Shell is a film that requires multiple viewings to truly be appreciated because of its subtle characters and fairly complicated story. Watching it once is hardly enough. It should also be noted that Ghost in the Shell has influenced an array of directors and films, most notably The Matrix.",Ghost in the Shell

The most important dialogs are spoken too fast and it's a big likelihood that at first time you won't be able to catch point of some dialogs(some scenes should be viewed several times). However, huge number of philosophical scenes(mainly with Mjr Motoko Kusanagi who often considers her humanity)is an important and stunning part of the movie(showing major's self-consciousness and gripping,animated, futuristic Japan). They are amplified by music which stimulate our imagination and is a great supplement to movie. Mayor(resembles girl from Blade Runner)is not only a cyborg but also developed form of live which desire to connect with Puppet Master. Although he has never been in touch with him, she instinctively feels this need. Puppet Master(originally Project 2501) is precursor of new revolution(created by man demands to be treated like a human, not like something controlled which is sentenced to being damaged). I have to admit that movie forced me to thinking. If we look at the human progress in movie, we will realize that we loose our humanity and self-conscious(memories, feelings can be removed or added without any problems, borderline between AI and human between true and false can no longer exist). What is more, AI is more powerful and might supersede humans. As I mentioned before the only disadvantage are prompt turning points. That's why my rate is 9.",Ghost in the Shell

Each of those things are just a small part of it. I collect information to use in my own way. All of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience. I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries."" - Major KusanagiThe 1995 cyberpunk film by Mamoru Oshii made a splash for anime in Western markets. On top of its stellar animation, character and world design, much in the tradition of the cyberpunk genre, GITS presents a philosophical look at highly cyberized highly bureaucratic highly oligarchic late capitalist society.Major Kusanagi, we're informed is equipped with a fully cyberized body. None of what can be physically identified as ""her"" is organically her. Nothing but her consciousness, or ghost, remains inside of a mechanical shell.There is a particularly compelling scene where the Major ponders if she can even be called really human any more. Her reflection provokes thought as to what it means to be human, and as to where and how much technology as a capacity to augment our reality has eroded our humanity. This philosophical pondering of self leaves us open to many ways of answering what it means to be a self in an age where all things and even people are becoming commodities in an increasingly bureaucratic & autocratic society.It's the axiom of impersonal market forces, high tech-low life culture that speaks to the immediate critique of the social relations and warped view of self that liberal capitalism puts us through. GITS offers no clear answers to the deep philosophical & social questions it raises but it does however offer a multifaceted critique of our future if current social systems and ways of thinking continue to plague the planet. For that reason, on top of some of the best animation I've ever seen, easily the best animation of the '90's right up there with Cowboy Bebop, I think it's important that as many people as possible experience this film.",Ghost in the Shell

208,mike-1038,Prejudiced against anime? Then watch this film.,10,11 May 2000,"Violence? Check. Complex narrative? Check. Heavy philosophical undertones? Check. Full frontal nudity? Check. From a personal viewpoint this film fulfills all the criteria to be an absolute masterpiece. Imagine if Blade Runner had been written by Kafka and directed by Francois Truffaut; the end result is probably quite similar to Ghost In The Shell.There are those who say that anime (or Japanese adult-orientated animation to be more precise) is nothing more than a silly gorefest, packed with irrelevant sex and violence. Not even the intelligence of Akira or the social commentary of Angel Cop can divert them from this view. Looks like Ghost In The Shell is just the right film for them. OK, there are some (ahem) rather disturbing scenes, but these are weighed down by the sheer scale of what this film is actually trying to say. Y'see, it's not just about cyborgs and hackers but the question of life and what it actually means to exist. Sounds ambitious? Sure is.Ghost In The Shell doesn't pull any punches in terms of presentation either. The animation is seamless and mesmerising, making the average Disney flick look like the doodles of a ten-year old. The whole film just oozes atmosphere - not since Blade Runner (there's that name again) have I seen a movie where music and picture work so perfectly in sync. It really is quite moving at times. A surprise plus point is the English translation. Admittedly, the dialogue is often drab and one-dimensional but I expected MUCH worse after Akira. At least they got professional voice actors to do the job this time.

210,A person who will always like films,It's a movie that's worth the effort,9,9 October 2001,"Firstly, every good thing said about this movie in the other reviews is pretty much true. Every bad thing said, is said by someone who really didn't 'get' this movie. And this is understandable - many people aren't going to get it - but believe me when I say I got it, and am still getting it, because with every repeat viewing there is something new to catch - something that slipped past the last time I watched it.Try and get a hold of the DVD if you can, since that has both the English and Japanese language versions. I'd suggest watching the English language version first, simply so that you can actually watch what's happening without having to focus on the subtitles at a cost to the beauty of the animation and atmosphere. This will let you really get a feel for some of the scenes in this movie - scenes that I feel are timeless. I'm not going to go into spoilers, but some parts reminded me of that other superb film 'The French Connection', simply due to the fact that both share the same dedication to certain 'set' pieces that operate almost independently of the film, really hooking your interest.And as for the delivery of the more philosophical ideas in the film [minor spoiler warning] please bear in mind that 2501 is a machine. Machines are precise and calculated. The way it rattles off constantly more complex truths is mechanical. It doesn't need to explain it slowly like a human would, it JUST states facts. And this puts them into your head. And with repeat viewings they start to grow. And this is how this film becomes deep - in an entirely relevant, impersonal mechanical way.Ghost in the Shell is a ten star anime, and probably wouldn't work in any other medium.

214,danieljameslearmouth,"Believable, yet unbelievable at the same time.",9,26 November 2011,"I was born the very same year this film was released - 1995. And is one of my favourite films from 1995, alongside Goldeneye. In fact, Ghost in the Shell by Mamoru Oshii is perhaps one of the greatest anime films to have ever been produced.In the year 2029, Major Motoko Kusanagi (Mimi Woods) of the Sector 9 Security Service is a cyborg with very human traits. She eats, sleeps, breathes, and even talks like a human, but in a society where cyborgs are replacing humans for government work, cyborgs are being repulsed by the masses. As such, anarchy breaks out. The Puppet Master - a master hacker who is a cyborg itself - breaks loose and starts to hack the humans' 'ghosts'; their minds which carry their memories and thoughts, and the Puppet Master manipulates these thoughts and memories as he sees fit. However, it is caught in a road accident, with the appearance of a nude woman. Because of this, the Puppet Master is incomplete, but still alive. It is up to Major Kusanagi and her right hand men Batou (Richard Epcar) and Togusa (Christopher Joyce) to stop the Puppet Master's terror and save the masses from the ghost hacks.This film was highly acclaimed by James Cameron himself, saying that this film was ""the first truly adult animation film to reach a level of literary and visual excellence."" I agree with his comments, as the film was one of pure genius and passion. Even the directors of The Matrix said that this film was what inspired their film.The plot it unlike most anime plots for the time. It's generic now, but at the time no-one had thought of something like this. Now, cyborg-cop plots are incorporated in The Matrix, or Deus Ex. I guess it could be said this IS Deus Ex.The animation, for example, is so fluid, you can barely tell when the frames are passing, it is that smooth. And unlike most anime, where the body is anatomically changed for the anime stereotype of cuteness, this film breaks this concept of that by having everything anatomically correct, from head to toe. Though, there are some characters in the film whose fingers split up into multiple prongs to type faster.Ghost in the Shell does have a tendency for the main character, Major Kusanagi, to strip down naked during some scenes, though most of these are for what missions she is undertaking. These usually include the stealth missions. Her cybernetic body allows her to use equipment which changes her in ways, such as making her invisible, enhancing her muscles, etcetera.The music is magical. It's on the level of Akira, with its score. It was composed by Kenji Kawai, and features female chanting and vocals, and percussion used in Shinto prayer (taiko drums). The lyrics of the intro song 'Making of a Cyborg' are sung in ancient Japanese, and are pretty much different to what Japanese now (the movie isn't even set in Japan). Even so, the soundtrack is still amazing.This is one of the first anime films to successfully cross anime with computer graphics (the first being Macross Plus), and was one of the first successful attempts at doing so. There is nary a problem with the CGI/anime crossover here, and it's great that it tried to mix the two together. In fact, I'm willing to say that the two complement formats each other brilliantly.Despite it winning some Academy Awards and being nominated for some as well, this film didn't popularise anime as a genre. I assume the reason for that is because it was too un-Western and too alien to most Western places. Sure, Akira kick-started the engine of anime popularity in Western nations (and it was released 7-8 years before Ghost in the Shell, too), but it still fell slightly short of popularising the anime genre. However, Ghost in the Shell itself is one of the more popular anime films out, so while it failed to popularise the genre, it was still pretty popular, and has a good fan base.The film was based loosely off the manga, by Masamune Shirow, and featured a lot of key scenes from the manga excluded from the film. As such, this spawned a TV series called ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"". The series sticks a lot closer to the manga, and the film itself got a sequel - Innocence - as well as a remake, called ""Ghost in the Shell 2.0"", which reused the voices, but also remade the entire movie, by upgrading the computer graphics, and bettered the quality of the characters' designs. However, the remake was lesser favoured than the original, so it may not be worth seeing, unless you want to.Usually, English dubs in anime are hit and miss. Examples of good dubs are Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Azumanga Daioh (different genre, still anime). Examples of bad dubs include the original English Akira dub, and One Piece (again, different genre but still anime). Ghost in the Shell is a great dub, and the voice acting fits most of the situations better than some other anime, although there is a little vocal hyperbole at points, where the voices are a little too deep, or exaggerated to make it look as though they were the tough guys. It's a good dub, but a little too exaggerated. Strangely enough the voice actor Mimi Woods, who was Kusanagi's voice actor, appeared in almost nothing after this work.Overall, I give Ghost in the Shell 92% - it's a thrill from start to finish, and has that undeniable classic feeling to it that you don't really notice in other anime. It's great, and it's pretty great to watch. Just don't go getting your ghost hacked.",Ghost in the Shell

(which claims himself as a live thing, how original) And it merges into a female cyborg who is confused about her identity. (of course, there is absolutely no scene that actually represents her identity crisis - just some vague scenes and her self-descriptions) It is the all plot we get. The anime ends there. Just throwing us some unsolved, not-too-brand-new questions about philosophical ideas and it is over. I just cannot believe why this thing is called a masterpiece.",Ghost in the Shell
217,passassin,An interesting philosophical aspect ruined by a mediocre anime,3,29 July 2013,"Before I start this review, remember I DID watch the subbed version, I did not watch the supposedly inferior English dub with supposedly worse dialogue and voice acting. Right off I get what is good at of the way. The action, as sparse as it was (About 4 violent scenes that last about 2 minutes each max), is amazing. The opening is one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. The anime is incredibly well animated, and the character designs are fantastic.However, the anime has a multitude of problems in its writing. Characters are poorly written, and overly blunt. Ironically, this makes them seem almost robotic. The main character is a great example of this. She has a fitting voice actor choice, but has so poor dialogue it doesn't even matter if she is well voiced or not. It also helps that the lack of emotion in the main character (which is clearly intentional with her character design) would likely be pretty easy to voice act. Many of the scenes drag at far longer then they should, surprising in such a short movie, and fail to convey the philosophical discussion with any kind of subtly. The important scenes that drive the plot however seem to go so fast (and their not action scenes) that its like they made them last and ran out of budget right before beginning them. Then there is the random scenes with the amazing music showing stills of the cyberpunk world. While the music here was awesome, it seems the only reasons for their existence was to A. Extend the anime long enough to be considered a movie and B. Force feed you that this is an ""Artsy"" anime that's trying to be deep and meaningful, something it fails at both.The ending is the worst part in a fairly boring anime. While it ends after an extremely awesome scene, it feels like its has been setting up the anime for an interesting plot twist...only to execute it so badly and explain so little that it feels like that it wasn't even the twist and that actual twist will be reveal in 5-15 minutes...at which point the movie ends. And I am left stunned that this anime was ever considered a masterpiece. Especially since so little actually happened. I could explain the entire plot in three sentences without skimping on details. (Which I don't of course since putting spoilers in a review ruins the point of writing one)The poor writing and pacing of the story, and the way it tries to force feed the philosophical nature of the movie's themes causes the movie to be an utter disappointment and laborious experience. Its like they thought ""We want to make a movie with philosophical themes, but we don't want to write a good story"" causing it to feel like 'Babbies first philosophical movie' instead of 'Interesting and complex cyberpunk movie with philosophical undertones' like it should have been.",Ghost in the Shell

The characters Motoko and Batou were very interesting characters and very likable. It's also too bad that there were some scenes that were a bit exposition heavy.

Main drawbacks are confusing dialog filled with techno-cyborg-babble,  two government agencies called section 6 and section 9 and it takes half the movie to figure out which one is which and who works for whom.

225,darwinelmolon,Not impressed,4,4 July 2021,"Cult film based on the manga, with a very different aesthetic, by Masamune Shirow. Undoubtedly ""Ghost in the Shell"" has two virtues that it is fair to highlight: its later influence and its zero aging. Let's go into his soul.As some of you already mentioned, the technical section is quite remarkable. A purely nineties classic animation, in 2D, which I personally prefer to the digitized rigidity of the 2000 era. The accompanying soundtrack is delightful and the moments of both pause and action are well inserted and carried. The theme around artificial intelligence may not be completely original but it brings seriousness and a certain message about the robotic evolution of Man. In this sense, it is fully in force despite the past twenty years and in fact the technological flood that is expected here has been completely true. In addition, only by looking at the credit titles we realize that the very ""Matrix"" was inspired, or copied, from it.So it seems that there are no hitches but, oh my friend, there are quite a few. The main one: ""Ghost in the Shell"" has no plot. The plot is very poor and, what is worse, it seems that it is a lot without being so to mislead the viewer from the true subject: what the Puppet Master (Puppet Master in English) is and what he wants, a dangerous hacker who is persecuted by the police. Don't be fooled by the political, scientific, philosophical and police elements that fill the hour and a half of footage, because none of this leads to anything solid or coherent. If we omitted the first sixty minutes, the last story would remain intact. Lots of straw for a clear and simple idea. Perhaps too clear and simple.Overrated.",Ghost in the Shell
226,scott_m,Setting the bar very high,10,30 December 2001,I have seen Ghost in the Shell (GITS) many times and would still watch it again if someone else suggested it. It is the anime I would recommend to anyone interested in getting into the genre. The only problem is that GITS sets the standards for anime so high that most other works of the genre will disappoint. GITS is just the right length  but will inevitably leaving you wanting to see more like it. It is certainly the Blade Runner of anime and a must see.,Ghost in the Shell
227,Don Armageddon,Let's set the record straight once and for all...,8,20 February 2002,"Anime is not for everyone.  No...wait, let me rephrase that: anime IS for everyone--you have your porno anime, your kiddie anime, your historical anime, etc.--but the very good anime, which, of course, Ghost in the Shell is a part of, is meant to be watched only by cereberal people or film buffs.The undisputed kings of anime cinema--Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Jin-Roh, among others--are complete and total headf***s.  The imbecile who insinuated that this calibre of anime is meant for kids (tedg, I believe) is completely wrong.  Pokemon is some of the stupidest trash I've ever watched, and while Dragon Ball Z has its merits (those beam attacks are AWESOME!) it's still a tire to sit through.  But they're bright, colorful, and have childish dialogue, so appeal to a younger demographic.  Ghost in the Shell is not within this category.I was first introduced to anime films with Ghost in the Shell, as a matter of fact, and before then I thought it was a retarded, low-animation soft-porn flick.  Hell, the cover of the video alone displayed Kusanagi, a gun-toting naked cyborg with massive robo-breasts, and that is certain to turn a few heads.Boy, was I wrong.  The few times you even do see naked female chests are not meant to be sexually arousing (note that I'm 16, at the peak of my horniness) and the philosophical questions brought up in the third act are incredibly intense, and obviously wouldn't appeal to the weak-minded.  Some parts of the dialogue were unnecessary, expository bull**** (every time I watch the boat scene, and Kusanagi rambles on to a fellow robot about how they metabolise alcohol quickly, I cringe) but the rest is pure gold.And sure, the animation is not as stunning as in, say, Tarzan, but if you look closer you'll notice that the characters move more realistically than in any Disney movie, from the most subtle shrug of their shoulders to putting on a coat.Ghost in the Shell is NOT the best anime film.  In fact, of the dozen I've seen (I don't care for TV series like Neon Genesis; I don't have the time) Akira takes that prize hands down.  But Ghost in the Shell deserves at least an 8.5/10 on any critic's scale, if not a 9.  If you're too fucking restless to sit through twenty minutes without a chase scene or a shotout (and GITS has plenty anyway) then stick to Segal and Van Damme.",Ghost in the Shell
228,Blue_TigerCub,There's more than you'd expect to this flick: there's poetry alongside the action.,10,14 February 2002,"If you're looking for great sci-fi action, ideas, images and effects, you'll definitely enjoy this one.But be prepared for a convoluted plot - if you're like me you'll be rewinding and watching the film again to make sure you didn't miss anything...and it's well-worth your time to do so; the rich, soulful atmosphere of this cyberpunk world deserves to be explored for more than the film's relatively short duration (under 100 minutes, I believe).Not unlike most Manga, it's the world that these people inhabit more than the story that really stimulates the senses.  This can also be said about the other category that Ghost in the Shell fits, that of cyberpunk, which Ridley Scott's classic Blade Runner first rendered so vividly almost 20 years earlier.Like the replicants and humans in Blade Runner who ponder the meaning of life in a world where technology can do anything we can do better, our hero this time, Major Kusunagi, finds herself debating the significance of real and 'artificial' existence, in a gorgeously-drawn Hong-Kong-like city in the future.You see, she herself is neither a human nor a replicant.  As an employee of a high-profile law-enforcement agency, she's been fitted with an entirely mechanical body, or ""SHELL""; all that remains of her human self is her soul within it - her ""GHOST"".(SOME DISCUSSION OF THE PLOT IS COMING UP!  BE WARNED, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, THIS MIGHT SPOIL A LITTLE BIT OF IT!)The mysterious appearance of the PuppetMaster (who we are led to believe is a hacker who can control people's minds by hacking into their ""Ghosts"") troubles the Major.  It triggers reminders of the conflict between technology and humanity that goes on inside of her - and she's becoming painfully aware that the technology is winning.So she goes swimming in the harbor at the mercy of her flotation devices, realizing that her metal body would sink and kill her if they failed (the look in her eye hints that she secretly wishes they would).  Heck, technology has even taken the fun out of drinking, she laments, her cyber-body can sober her up in seconds at the mere thought of it.  It's details like these that give Ghost in the Shell an eerie sense of realism and seriousness, one that plays off neatly with the high-tech action sequences that pepper the plot as it rolls along.There's a particularly dazzling scene - one of the most BEAUTIFUL scenes in any movie I've EVER seen - a montage of people going about their lives in this urban landscape.  It really drives the point home:  the imagined future of the film is one that has lost its soul.  And further into the montage the images look less like an unfamiliar nightmare-future and more like a very REAL present-day.  It's a haunting warning to the viewer that the Major's world may not be too far off our own horizon.The Major meets her exact counterpart in the 'Puppetmaster': it is not a hacker, but in fact a ""Ghost"" unlike any other.  ""It"" (neither a he nor a she) was ""born in the sea of information"".  For the first time, technology has actually created a soul - something that is alive.  It's fitting that an engraving of the Evolutionary Tree of Life on the wall is destroyed just as the PuppetMaster, an artificial soul born without a body, and the Major, a soul who gave up her body for an artificial one, finally meet.This is not just another ""Blood, Tits 'n' Guts"" cartoon for adolescent ravers.  It feels more like, ""Stanley-Kubrick-meets-The-Matrix"".Try watching Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell side-by-side, you'll probably find that it holds up well - which says a lot, considering that Blade Runner ranks in the 'Top-100' on this site (it ranks #67).",Ghost in the Shell
229,tim-devisser86,"Ghost in the shell is difficult, but still a fix for the intellectual adrenaline-junkie",8,8 August 2009,"As I see it, Ghost in the Shell is difficult. This is partly due to the subject matter, partly due to its style, and I suspect also because of language barriers (the Dutch subtitles are horrid, but even the English dub seems awkward sometimes). Suffice to say that few movies have challenged me as much as GITS has. I had never seen anything like GITS when I first saw it years ago, and I have never seen anything like it since. It is an exploration of the effects technology could have on the human condition: on crime, global politics, identity, and death. True, the Matrix attempted to emulate its visual style and explore similar themes, but it is in many ways a more superficial and commercialized product. Ghost in the Shell portrays a realistic, near-future Japan, wherein cybernetics have become commonplace. Experiences and memories can be digitized, and therefore manipulated. Reality and fiction, as well as human beings and robots, become difficult to distinguish as a result. Section 9 is a top-secret task-force consisting mostly of cyborgs, whose main purpose is to pro-actively pursue hackers intending to manipulate the minds of others. Throughout the movie their commander, Motoko Kusanagi, is forced to question what defines her identity. The story allows for gorgeous action scenes animated in brilliant detail, subtle character-development, a very complex counter-terrorist plot that is somewhat difficult to follow, and extensive, sometimes long-winded reflections on post-humanism, philosophy of mind, and the nature of identity. Although the result is uniquely interesting, the movie sometimes explains to much, and sometimes explains too little, to maintain the interest of casual viewers. In my opinion, the movie is slightly too complex and short for its own good. It is still a beautiful anime, an audiovisual delight for any intellectual adrenaline-junkie, but... difficult. Worth it, though... The series, ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"", takes more time to develop its characters, its storyline and its fictional and philosophical context context, and is an all-round improvement, although fans of a more purist or artistic stripe might disagree.",Ghost in the Shell
230,JimDaBoff,Give it a chance - you wont regret it,10,13 February 2008,"I first saw Ghost in the Shell at a friend's house, on a dodgy copied DVD, on a dodgy DVD player. The whole film had a green tint and scuppered the viewing pleasure somewhat, but I still came away realising I had seen a milestone in animation.I now own the film myself and can't stop coming back to it. When you watch it the first time, you'll be torn between watching the glorious visuals, trying to follow the complex cyberpunk police investigation storyline, and trying to find where you stand when the film dabbles in philosophy and the nature of self. With each subsequent viewing, you'll get more out of it. It's one of those.I like to think that GitS tries to ask the same questions as Blade Runner ie. How human can a computer be? Will humans be considered inferior and obsolete if computers can develop emotion and self-awareness? Except, of course, where Blade Runner was concerned with the destruction of Replicants/androids, GitS shows us a society where ""cyeberisation"" or the augmenting or our bodies with machines is the cultural norm, which makes for refreshing and compelling viewing.The shift in technology has of course seen a shift in technological crime. Enter our heroes, Section 9, an elite technological crime-fighting unit let by Major Motoko Kusanagi, a soul-searching android.To people not familiar with anime (and there are clearly quite a few, having perused the message boards) GitS will be very different to anything else you've watched. But open your mind to the possibility that animation can be so much more than a cartoon. And if you wont, stick with it anyway - the 5-minute dialogue-less scene halfway through the film and the climactic battle scene are two of the most beautifully animated and directed sequences I've ever seen, backed by a soft but very effective score from Kenji Kawai.All in all, a brilliantly executed vision of the future.",Ghost in the Shell
231,Aldran-X,"A Beautiful Shell, but Needs a Better Ghost",6,8 March 2005,"I believe one of the hardest things in reviewing this anime today is trying to determine what made it so popular when it was released. As beautiful as it looks and how compelling its story is, I find that Ghost in the Shell lacks a personal touch that could have made it far greater.Oshii's vision of the manga is dark, serious and uses some amazing cinematography that, while no longer as amazing by today's standards (and even the film's sequel), still offers a groundbreaking look at the efforts to merge art and animation. The story is very smart and engaging as well, offering a wide range of metaphysical concepts that have gone so far as to inspire another philosophical (and more action-packed) phenomenon, The Matrix. If anything, the film makes you think a great deal about the ideas it produces (or pulls from the manga), possibly producing your own questions or theories in regards to what is real, who and what we are, and so on.But while the art and intelligence of Ghost in the Shell is powerful in itself, I would have gladly sacrificed a chunk of it to give the film a little more heart. The characters - even good-humored Batou - feel bland and unimportant in the film, offering little more than an outlet to spew plot points and keep the story going. The movie also relies heavily on waves of philosophical monologues that, while interesting, slow the movie down to the point where you're basically watching a still screen with the voice track playing over it. Compelling as the film is, I've had actual lectures that have kept me interested longer than some of Ghost in the Shell's more ""spiritual"" moments. If you have a short attention span, you probably won't last through this film; other than a few brief bursts, the film lacks the energy to keep the restless and fidgety glued to their seats for long.Oshii deserves credit for his efforts, but Ghost in the Shell is still a film that relies too heavily on its look and not enough on its personality. It truly is a beautiful Shell, but the Ghost within doesn't do it justice. FINAL SCORE: 6/10",Ghost in the Shell
232,Hyathin,erratic and lacking,5,1 August 2004,"Though this movie does have a few good moments and pretty good animation it is overall a grand disappointment. I dare say that the only people who will like this are those who never read the manga. The movie is seriously lacking so many of the elements of the original story line presented in the comic. Normally you can excuse it because they can't put it all in, but the result is a movie that makes very little sense by comparison, at times is tedious, and left me going ""What!? they screwed this all up!"" The manga is worth good out a reading (if you can find it) and to me is a classic in a way.

The fall-from-window scene in matrix:reloaded is a tribute to this movie. That is saying something. This was one if the first (now of many) anime movies I saw, and it sold me. The Japanese have their own style, and even though i like Nemo and IceAge, this is something special. I recommend Japanese sound with subtitles (that may be just me), the English dubbing doesn't quite get into the story as much.

Its aesthetic style is unrivaled, its themes are eyebrow raising, and it plays with heavy topics that people had seldom questioned back in 1995. This visually stunning movie plays with large philosophical questions like consciousness, identity, and ego cast against large technocratic corporations. I have no problem calling this film required viewing for any sci-fi fan. Everyone should see this movie once.The problem with it is, it doesn't have much watchability after the first viewing. Sure, you may want to watch it a second time to make sure you understood everything, but certainly not for its entertainment value. The movie is very slow paced, almost 90% dialogue, only having a few action scenes peppered throughout. It hardly has any actual storyline outside of the philosophical questions it poses. The conclusion is open ended, without providing the viewer with any satisfying sensation of conflict resolution. It just sort of... ends. No trumpets, no thunder, just cut to a cityscape and roll credits.So definitely give it a watch, think on it a bit, and move on. The film is good for what it is, and I can see why people call it a work of art, or even ""Masterpiece"".

You should actually watch it more than once to understand it fully.
It is japanese animation from a manga, just don't let prejudice prevail and watch the friggin movie.
Let me explain my vote:Direction. Vote 9/10. Mamoru Oshii chose a very slow paced narration, very different from the manga. The atmosphere is heavy and dull, very not anime-like.
Screenplay. Vote 9/10. Kazunori Ito picked a narrative arc from the Masamune Shirow original manga and adapted to a more serious tone. All the comical relief and fan service disappeared. They went deeper into the character's psyche and posed some ethic and philosophical questions.
Mecha design. Vote 9/10. Shirow is very famous for his mechanical designs but Shoji Kawamori took them and made them more realistic and ""adult"". They fit perfectly with the rest of the more mature aspects of the movie
Art and Animation. Vote 9/10. The color palette is very dull, many scenes are dark, the backgrounds are aged and dirty. Just a thing of beauty. Animations are still good after 24 years. Not ultra spectacular for today standards but still very good (keep in mind at that time they still handpainted every cell).
Music. Vote 9/10. Very unique but somehow it blends very well with the moviePlease watch this movie, especially if you've seen the hollywood transposition and you feel it could have been deeper.",Ghost in the Shell

The doubts that are placed in Motoko let you think about the use of AI (and it's consequences on the programs) and at the same time you start wondering about your own feelings.

The major is a cyborg, which in many an American movie or TV show would mean ""The major is a human being with great strength and special abilities.""  However, Ghost in the Shell (or GitS) is not a movie to make such a simplification.  A central issue in the film is the question of her humanity.  Who did she used to be before her body was rebuilt?  Was she ever a human being at all, or was she ""made from scratch"" as a cyborg?  Is she a real person at all?  Such introspection, one of the movie's main focuses, is handled in a masterful and thought-provoking (though occasionally dialog-heavy) way.GitS's action scenes provide the other focus.  Cinematic use of camera angles, jaw-dropping animation, incredible stunts, and clever symbolism make these (short) sequences memorable and exciting.  GitS has often been compared to The Matrix in this sense, and I found the comparison to be quite favorable.  The choreography and detail put into GitS's animation achieves the same stunning result as Matrix's special-effects magic.A serious, philosophical, action-filled science fiction movie, Ghost in the Shell is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.

252,souradeep_sarkar,Highly ahead for it's time...,10,11 May 2020,"I just want to start off by saying that ""Ghost In The Shell"" loves to asks it's audience questions. What is it that makes us human? Is it the soul (referred to as 'ghosts' in this film)? Or is it flesh and bone? What happens when your memories can be erased and replaced like music on your iPod? If your body is entirely mechanical, can you still call yourself human? If your consciousness is active, yet your body is nowhere to be found, do you still exist?Okay. Let's get to the review.Story
Cyborg cops battle an anonymous super-hacker who takes control of people's computerized brains and forces them to do his bidding. It's a wicked sci-fi thriller, yet it's also so much more. Not only is it a refreshingly original take on the standard Cops vs Criminals plot, but it manages to do it in such an intelligent manner. At it's core, the movie asks the audience ""What is it that makes us Human?""; Although it never truly finds an answer (can anyone?), it gets closer to it than any other film has yet dared to go. The best part is, with all the philosophical, existentialist and technical chatter, it never really tries to beat the audience over the head with it. Many of the ""big questions"" are handled in subtle ways that keep the pace of the film going, while still making the audience think. ""Ghost In The Shell"" is cyberpunk at it's best.Art
GitS came out in 1995 and still the visuals can compete with current animation standards. This film has aged extremely well. The action is wicked, every scene is full of atmosphere thanks to well detailed backgrounds, and the limited CGI is well integrated, even in such an early stage of CG animation. Yet the most astonishing part of the art is not the quality of the animation, or the artwork. It's the level of thought and polish that went into creating the look and feel of this film. As an example: There is a scene where the heroine, Motoko, is fighting a criminal while wearing a suit that makes her invisible. Even though she is invisible, we can still see her shadow. This is because her invisibility is only an optical illusion. There is still a solid mass blocking the light. It's little details like this one that make the visuals so incredible and, more importantly, believable.Sound
The sounds of the film remain on the same high level as the art. Gunfire, ricochets, explosions, and even all the little computer noises are crisp and well implemented. The music is also quite fitting and original ('Making of a Cyborg', played during the opening credits, is one example). Make sure you watch it in original language.Character
Though all the characters had aspects that made them interesting, Motoko is really the star of the show here and is the only character who developed over the course of the film. Of course, the direction in which her character went more than makes up for this fact. Throughout the whole film she is struggling with the thought of losing her humanity due to being a cyborg, and it all leads up to an incredible finale that just leaves you in awe.Enjoyment
Now, I'm giving it a 10 for enjoyment, but with an asterix. I personally loved this movie to death due to just how intelligent it is. Unfortunately, it is not an easy film to get into. Very little time is taken to explain how the GitS universe works. For example: The opening scene has Motoko speaking telepathically with Batou, who's nowhere to be scene. The film never really takes the time to explain how this is done, but you do manage to draw your own conclusions once you get your first glimpse of a cyberbrain. Unfortunately, much of the film relies on just how quickly the audience can put together the little details of the world and storyline. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can make things needlessly complicated and actually alienate viewers who may not have the patience to put together the pieces of this techno-puzzle. Luckily, the principle story is simple enough, and the action is good enough so that viewers can still have fun with it. Basically, it can leave you feeling pretty stupid, but you still pat yourself on the back for seeing it through to the end. And don't be surprised if you want to watch it a second time.Overall
With great action and an intelligent narrative, ""Ghost In The Shell"" is a classic. It inspired ""The Matrix"" and anyone who has seen that film will know how great of a compliment that is. If you're into philosophical discussions about the soul and the consequences of technological evolution, see this film. If you just want to see a bunch of cyborg cops shooting stuff up, see this film. You will not be disappointed.",Ghost in the Shell

254,cynewulf-20361,A Ghost in the Shell and a Diamond in the Rough,10,30 October 2020,"Ghost in the Shell is a piece of cinematic genius.1. Animation was amazingThis is the pinnacle of animation in the 90's. As time goes on, animation gets more and more realistic, but nothing I've ever seen matches the aura and feel of The Ghost in the Shell's art style. It is timelessly beautiful. An unquestionable testament to the animator's artistic skill and vision is the nearly 3 and a half minute interlude in the middle of the movie. This actionless interlude contains 34 panoramic views of the life of this futuristic city. This animation truly explores the setting and almost characterizes it through its development and presentation.2. Language BarrierThe only complaint I have about the film is the english version, like many animated films and anime, is not very good. The english translation is alright overall, and gets the story across slightly better than the english subtitles on the japanese version, but it does not compare to the original voice actors. The original voice actors put much more life into the characters than their english counterparts, and it really shows in the final result. After watching the film in both English and Japanese, I have come to the conclusion that the japanese audio is a better experience even though the nuances of the plot are slightly harder to follow.3. Themes and SettingThe themes and setting of the story have aged very well. The futuristic computer-focused atmosphere is even more relevant now than it was in 1995 when it was originally released. The story emphasizes bad scenarios that come with technological progression. These include obvious things like powerful weapons and gadgets, for example the cloaking devices or tanks, but span all the way over to more complex issues like the self-actualization of an Artificial Intelligence. The scene and themes work hand in hand to make this a very deep piece of cinema that has held its own for 25 years and will continue to hold its own for 25 more.",Ghost in the Shell

257,jekone,One of the best Japanese Manga productions I've ever seen.,9,31 December 2001,"This is one of the best Japanese Manga productions I've ever seen.Ghost in the Shell is a very good Japanimation made with different animation techniques. For most of the time you'll see traditional cell animation, most cell animations are imposed over beautiful hand-painted sceneries. And a some 2d cgi and 3d cgi techniques are also used, most 3d is not that obvious to see, it's only obvious in some cutscenes. One of the best scenes to look at is a ride trough canals in a city that looks like Hong-Kong with nicely hand-painted backgrounds cgi rain and other cgi effects, but only the cell animation on top of it doesn't blend that well in the whole look of it. But what really completes this scene is the Japanese music.The storyline is good, but not the best of what I've seen in other Japanimations. It's a pretty straightforward storyline about hacks being made into cyborgs. The are not that many surprises in the story, the end is somewhat predictable but how when and where it happens is very nice.I can be breef about the sound and music: very good. The music is very nice. The English voices are okay, but I prefer it in Japanese.I've you've seen the Matrix (1999) you can see where some of posses in the Matrix are borrowed from.And if you like Japanimation, you've got to see Ghost in the Shell.",Ghost in the Shell
258,chancesilvers,"Great movie for a select audience, not a mainstream blockbuster.",7,26 October 2021,"Ghost in the shell is a movie made for only a few types of people. The die-hard anime or SCI-FI fan, or the deep thinkers and the more philosophically inclined. I think that the movie was a great example of how underlying messages and really good storytelling can be done in a piece of cinema that is not even 90 minutes long. From an objective standpoint, I am not too sure that the movie is for the mainstream audience as it is relatively slow-paced, a little hard to follow at times, and has at this point a slightly dated look to it. That is not to say that the movie is boring, however, as die-hard SCI-FI fans will love the story elements seen throughout the movie and its innovative ideas that truly revolutionized the genre. Many works that came after this would not have happened or would have been drastically different than what people know today such as The Matrix or James Cameron's Avatar. Another negative to the movie that may make people turn away from this movie that must be mentioned is the gore and nudity. While the gore for me is relatively minor and can be easily overlooked and did not affect me whatsoever the nudity was jarring, for me at least. While I understand the emphasis on it from a story standpoint, one example being that Kusanagi was made to be a nearly indistinguishable copy of a human being so it made sense that she would be a copy through and through, I felt that the nudity was mostly just thrown in as fan service and was made to appease the target Japanese audience at the time. What made the movie for me though is the deeply philosophical undertones throughout the whole movie and how the two characters reflected modern, real-world philosophers' thoughts and concepts. The philosophical debate of Ghost in the Shell spreads from the identity conflict of the main character Kusanagi and how she deals with that and finds her place in the world. She is always questioning through the whole movie who she is and just where does she stand, going so far as to multiple times bring up the ""Ghost"" concept, this movie's symbolic term for a soul, and how that we as humans see that as a bug in their programming. Throughout most of the scenes where she debates this concept with her partner Batou they stand on conflicting sides of this, Batou stands more on Descartes's form of thought which is "" I think, therefore I am."" To Batou, the mere capability of having their own thoughts and being able to act is more than enough for him, Kusanagi however, Sees things in a darker sense. Kusanagi takes the thoughts of Nietzsche into her life more so, questioning that if it is just enough to be able to think, how can we be sure that we are the ones coming up with the thought, or did the thought come up with you? Now I know that can be a confusing idea to wrap your head around, but the movie drives home that concept in the scene with Kusanagi and Batou on the boat after she got done diving, and the voice of Kusanagi can be heard by both of the characters and it was lead to be believed that she did not consciously make that thought. Leading us to believe it sprung out on its own accord, meaning she did not have the thought herself.Ghost in the Shell is a wonderful, philosophical masterpiece that for me will go down as one of the most thought-provoking movies I have seen in a while. The mainstream audience may not appreciate the movie for what it is truly conveying though.",Ghost in the Shell
259,ligertiger,A hollow shell of a movie,3,21 September 2010,"Being both an avid Sci-fi and anime fan, I was very eager to see this movie. An animation focused on the close future, where cybernetics and androids thrive, sounds fun.However unfortunately that is exactly what this film lacked... fun. Firstly we're thrown into some disorientating scenes, of which there is barely any explanation of what is going on. When you do start to get a very slippery grasp on this film, you'll find yourself simply sliding off again, as the movie throws in terminology and conversations which you don't even know the basis of. I would've preferred to have been told what a ""ghost"" or a ""shell"" is, and a clear description of the technological world the inhabitants have created for themselves, without having to guess, and without trying to piece together the various fragments of information that are lazily and carelessly thrown out at various intervals.And, I'm guessing these action scenes are supposed to be riveting yes? Well, personally they were as interesting as watching the grass grow, no emotion, no passion, I just got the sense they were lacking in something so deeply. In all seriousness, I think Pokemon has more interesting action scenes than this.The plot of this film (plot? there was a plot to this?!), was immensely hollow, not to mention hard to follow. The emergence of an artificial entity known as the Puppet Master causes Major Kusanagi to question her existence, showing as much emotional distress and depth as a slug. At the end, she combines herself with this 'Puppet Master'(after a harrowingly dull fight scene with a tank), with no adequately explained reason. And thus ends this dreadful dreadful movie.The only good merits I can put on the film are the concepts within it, notably the advanced use of technology, such as, being able to connect with a world wide interface via implants in the brain, which with our ever growing advances in technology could be a reasonable scenario for the future.However I'm afraid this movie has almost completely destroyed my interest in Sci-fi Anime films, and it frustrates me to hell that this movie has so many positive reviews. Personally, I'd prefer something with much more consistency, than this complete garbage.",Ghost in the Shell

265,cytrs0,Ghost in the Shell is a well-executed and substantive film worth both watching and thinking about.,9,15 February 2012,"Ghost in the Shell was and is a great example of both sci-fi and anime, and is widely regarded as the film which opened western audiences up to the concept of a ""serious"" anime. This is an excellent movie which expects something of its viewers and gives much to those willing and able to meet the challenge.This film explores what it means to be a person in a post-cyberpunk near future where people and technology have begun to meld. For the most part, this is done with esoteric, fast-paced dialogue between the main character (the Major) and her companion (Batou). It may feel to some as though these conversations were inserted not for the betterment of the work, but rather the reception thereof. At times characters give somewhat long philosophical and/or expository speeches; one should keep in mind the difficulties of explaining a universe and expressing thoughts so complex as those in this film -- contrived monologues are often necessary.There are brief sequences containing nudity and/or violence. These are spaced out and well-done, with no scene featuring either being at all gratuitous and an in-universe explanation of why what nudity there is is present.There is much artistry in the film's presentation. Even the beginning credits are beautiful just as they serve a purpose. Not only was the visual style thoroughly enjoyable, but so too was there the mark of a great craftsman on Ghost in the Shell's audio; during the climax there is beautiful audio-visual dissonance which uses the uncanny valley to great effect. The score lends itself to the piece's mood etc and could stand apart from GITS and still be regarded as good. One would be hard-pressed to find unnecessary material in this film, though this may contribute to a vague feeling of the story being rushed and, perhaps, unfinished.The main characters are somewhat angst-ridden, a fact evident in their questioning of their own humanity along with their other musings. This is likely because the director attempted to establish a very particular mood, using dialogue to that end. Some viewers will become lost in the rapidly shifting world set twenty minutes into the future in which the story takes place; references are often made to concepts from advanced sociology and philosophy. Nietzche was not unknown to the writers, this much is clear.Western audiences may be bothered by the ending of this film. In American cinema it is considered bad form to leave any ""loose ends"" or major questions at a piece's close. This is a Japanese film and their different opinion on the matter is evident. Some criticize Ghost in the Shell for its ending not expressly answering the existential questions posed throughout the film. However, this movie was not meant to answer, but rather ask. The ending of GITS leaves an emptiness meant to be filled by the viewer's ruminations on what was said and, more importantly, what wasn't.One should watch the subbed version rather than the dubbed one. There were certain script changes which were in bad taste.9 out of 10",Ghost in the Shell

267,andy-429-893828,Cyberpunk masterpiece. (no spoilers as far as i am aware),9,4 January 2014,"Story- 9/10 (This is the same review that i wrote and posted on ''MyAnimeList'', my account name is 'KingFlabadingdon')Puppet Master: ''And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?''The story and themes present in Ghost in the Shell (GitS) are both striking and very relevant. GitS takes place in a more than possible future world where cybernetics and AI have become a social norm. The amazing detail given to the universe and the true to life reflection of today's society makes the themes in question incredibly applicable. The different opinions in GitS are argued with a certain potency and precision. The maturity and skill of the characters in putting across their arguments will encourage the viewer to contemplate these 'philosophical' issues from a very serious stance. The 'main' story (when I say main, it is really just an excuse to bring up these themes, which are the focus) isn't so revolutionary in terms of originality but is definitely very intelligent. A mysterious master hacker, known as the puppet master has been causing some negative repercussions in the political world of GitS. Section 9 has thus been asked to investigate. This can be seen as nothing more than the story of an extended and very standard TV episode. And to an extent, you can't argue with that. But rather than witnessing the usual, ''-enemy is introduced, -enemy makes their move, [*good guys then find a way to defeat this enemy*], -enemy apprehended'' sort of arc, the story unfolds in a very intelligent manner. The movie uses this particular case to initially explore interesting notions in the GitS universe, such as social inequality, the soul or 'ghost' of a robot and corrupt politicians. The story's themes will then take over and the resulting dialogue leads to some very interesting ideas. Overall, it is a very smart and engaging version of what would've otherwise had been a standard plot. The only 'flaw' in the story of the movie is that it assumes you to have at least a basic knowledge of the GitS universe. Whilst there isn't anything vital you need to know, the huge amount of detail and history can be too much to take in at times. If anything, (if you are a fan of cyberpunk/ sci-fi) this should just inspire you to learn more about the complex universe. Do not worry about being new to the universe; just have your thinking cap on. Sound/ art- 10/10The art and soundtrack in GitS are ground-breaking. A new method of animation at the time used for the film was basically designed to create a sense of depth in the different levels of animation. This resulted in some amazingly detailed backgrounds and city views. Beauty is in the detail, and with so much detail, you are really able to become fully immersed into the universe before you. The art style is basically a timeless example of how to animate a mature and intelligent film like GitS. For example, the opening credits was just converted computer code used in a creative way. It was lovely to see this clear, harmonious language between the universe and the media used to portray it. The art and soundtrack was so inspiring, that in the film are a series of scenes that are entirely composed of visuals of the city backed by a brilliant OST. I couldn't help but smile in awe at the level of detail and beauty. Characters- 8/10This is an unfair section to mark a single film on, when in reality GitS just follows on from two whole series of character development. In reality, you can watch the film without watching the TV series'. This is sadly due to the fact that you never really see the characters personalities in the film. They just operate as speakers for the themes in the film. Despite this, the cast are able to deliver these arguments with great effect because of their own maturity and strength of character. Enjoyment-10/10 Ghost in the Shell is an all-time classic. As mentioned, I absolutely love the detail in the universe. I want to become immersed, and I can very easily become immersed thanks to the soundtrack and artwork. You cannot help but admire what you are watching. In terms of action, GitS certainly knows how to deliver. Although not an action led film, the two action scenes actually featured are nothing short of masterpieces. There was a mixture of technology, well-choreographed combat and intense build ups. All backed up by a great atmosphere. Having all of this done in such a mature style enabled me to take everything that much more seriously which made the arguments far more engaging. Overall-9/10Although released in 1995, the ideas presented in GitS are becoming more and more pertinent. The ground breaking media and level of detail in GitS has and will continue to inspire many films for years to come. I thoroughly recommend you to watch this film and I encourage you to look into the other GitS films and TV series' that are equally as stunning.",Ghost in the Shell

269,mark200789,"Misogynistic garbage, even for anime...",1,11 June 2004,"I revisited a ""classic"" recently. I'm a pretty big Anime fan and I lie pretty much in the norm concerning my tastes. I enjoy all the most revered of the genre: Akira, Gundam, Evangelion, Princess Mononoke, etc. These are all more than just ""cartoons"", they are films with all the baggage that label entails. But there is one highly rated Anime that I don't understand all the fuss over: Ghost in the Shell. Supposedly this thing influenced the Matrix more than anyother source. I remember seeing it several years ago an not being impressed, so I decided to see it again hoping that it would have a better effect. It was worse than I could have imagined.This is a bad, bad movie on so many levels. First, and foremost, it is the most unapologetically misogynistic piece of crap I've ever seen... And not in a good way. There are certain kinds of misogyny that no man can help but enjoy, like girly magazines or Rolling Stones songs. Juvenile, but entertaining. Well, Ghost in the Shell makes ""Stray Cat Blues"" look like a tribute to the strength of the female of the species.While its true the two main antagonists of the film are both very powerful women, they are mistreated in such a way that is so grotesque I can't seem to find a funny metaphor. First of all, the main character is nude throughout most of the film for no reason, especially during combat scenes. Supposedly she has to be nude to use an invisibility device, but a male character uses the same device fully clothed. This is a silly kind of fanboy misogyny that they could get away with little more than a chuckle from me, but then they had to get into mutilation.You see, both main characters are robots that only look like humans, so they can take quite a bit of abuse without dying. Both characters are horrendously mutilated throughout the movie, losing limbs left and right, and usually being naked while its happening. In the end their upper torsos are dragged around like trash and put on display - their faces and breasts still intact. I guess those are the only parts that are important to the director who seems to want to make the titillation of the nudity and the violence if the dripping entrails into a single arousal. This is a new form of low in a movie that actually wants to be taken seriously. This could only come from the mind of someone who viscerally hates women and wants to see them humiliated in the worst possible way.To top it all off, like most pseudo-pornography, the plot is nonexistent. People will have you believe that it's all about the line between sentience and mechanism, but that's been done to death since Pinocchio. Dialog is purely scientific and lacks any humanity. Characters are purely two dimensional and never grow nor bring out feelings of sympathy from the audience. That's the worst problem about this film - it's all about the science and not about the humanity. Akira wasn't about human evolution, it was about two friends in a disproportionate relationship. Evangelion wasn't about giant mecha, it was about a semi-autistic 12 year old learning to trust others and love himself. Ghost in the Shell is all about computer viruses and disembodied titties, and that's why it sucks. It's nothing more that an technological version of Baywatch - that is if Pamela Anderson was ripped to shreds by a shark and her carcass was hung on the wall as a trophy...",Ghost in the Shell
270,Zekk-1,Cyber Punk at its finest,10,27 April 2005,"Mamoru Oshii (Avalon, GITS: Innocence) has taken the finest work of Masamune Shirow (Appleseed, Dominion Tank Police)and turned it into something so artful and inspiring that just about every sci-fi to come into theatres since 1994 has pulled from it in some way or another. My favorite scene takes place near the middle of the movie. It is an introspective look deep into the mind of a cyborg who feels lost in the new age of mass digital information. Her personal freedom is restricted due to the fact that her mechanical body belongs to the department she works for.When an entity claiming sentience comes along in the form of a computer virus it starts our Heroin on a journey that will push the boundaries of our conceptions of what makes a person human and what defines us as sentient beings.Ghost in the Shell is more than just a cyber punk shoot em up.

271,koryanpiora,Highly over rated.,1,30 November 2004,"For some reason, anime has become increasingly popular in the past few years. Perhaps in their unending search for ""cool"", American teens have decided to settle on the strangest form of film and television they could find. Whatever the reason, it's well past time for this fad to end.""Ghost in the Shell"" represents everything wrong with anime. It attempts to be far too philosophical while not really answering any of the questions it half-heartedly asks. It's take on the evolution of man, as cyborgs with souls, is a sad Sci/Fi rendition of Burgess's ""A Clockwork Orange"". Simultaneously, the action attempting to keep this travesty afloat is slow, boring, and all together unbelievable.There's a scene where a cyborg babe is fighting a tank. The tank has the ability to demolish the pillars the girl is hiding behind with its main cannon, instead it fires a stream of bullets that merely wear away at the stone. I find it very difficult to believe that in a age of cyber-cameo and machinized people that targeting computers would be so bad that a person, however enhanced, could still outrun bullets. This isn't ""The Matrix"". This is bad cinema. Of the dialogue, most is forgettable. However, one line involving a pressure sensor has stuck with me. Apparently, all the characters are clairvoyant and on the same page of any crisis that may be going on. Why people enjoy this movie is beyond me. The majority of anime is terrible. Normally, I'd feel bad about making a blanket statement like that, but in this case I'm right. There are several animes that are more than amazing (""Akira""), and so it boggles my mind why the subpar ones would gain so much attention. The worst part is, the movie starts amazingly. A feeling of high tensions fills a room as an invisible assassin slips in. Gun fire, exploding bodies, a short chase, it's all here. From that point on the audience is only presented with dull, superficial action, a plot that really has no context in its own world, and a philosophy a high school student would find elementary.",Ghost in the Shell
272,CorruptPolitician_187,"Visually impressive, muddled execution",7,14 April 2016,"I really thought I was going to like this one. Let's begin with the positive. The animation is stunning even 21 years later. It's masterfully done and the scene that lets us simply appreciate life in this strange new world is amazing. I loved it. As you can see, I was completely entranced by the world and concepts. So I was really disappointed when the film ended without barely exploring this amazing new world. Not only that but I was also disappointed with the plot and writing. The plot of this film is just an afterthought made to expose us to all the interesting philosophical questions poised by the characters. While I did find these questions quite interesting and the filmmaker gets across his line of thought - even if it is through clunky exposition sometimes - the film itself never stops to let us ponder what is being discussed. Besides, with all its technical future mumbo-jumbo and references to things and people we don't know it all becomes muddled and unnecessarily complex. Due to this, Ghost in a Shell appears to have a complex plot but the plot is simple. Cyborg looks for criminal and at the same time searches for answers about her own existence. I will give it another chance though if only because I unknowingly obtained a dubbed copy of it. I found the English dub quite awful, so maybe the Japanese version will do the trick instead.",Ghost in the Shell

The Animation:This movie is hyper-stylish for it's time, in fact The Matrix borrows from this movie a lot. The action is amazing, the amount of effort that went into making this movie seems painstaking, as it completely hand-drawn, with none of your fancy pants see-jee- aye with your computermachines.

It splits the movie's pacing for me into two halves as it dwindles in comparison to the pacing in the first half, where the second has the same solid pace.Other than that it's amazing If your not into anime or think animation is a load of b*******S, this is one you should watch. To anyone who only wants great movies, This is for you. Watch it Just watch it",Ghost in the Shell
275,petermay13,"A cannibalisation of better stories, but a truly beautiful feat of animation",7,14 May 2015,"Ghost in the Shell lives in the shadow of better stories: the 80's saw the birth of Cyberpunk with Gibson's smash hit novel ""Neuromancer"", the spirit of which looms over Ghost in the Shell like it's a lawyer clutching a book on copyright law. It's tone, aesthetic, setting and even some plot points are almost directly lifted from the novel, although you will never hear an anime fan admit as much. It's inspiration is not just drawn solely from Neuromancer, which could be excused seeing as there has never been a film adaptation as of the time of writing: a spiritual successor to an acclaimed novel would have been wonderful. But as it is, it feels like a mash up of popular 80's sci-fi, whether it be Neuromancer, Blade Runner or, a parallel more obvious for Japanese audiences, Akira. The soundtrack may have moments of brilliance, but it mostly feels out of place and wasted. The juxtaposition created by the tribal drumming and chanting with a neon dystopia may be intentional: it just flat out doesn't work to my ears.That being said, it adds a few interesting dynamics to the story with regards to memory, although the characters are anything but memorable: the protagonist feels like a busty love-child of a replicant and a razorgirl, whose boobs the animators can't stop cutting to for no reason other than apparently for their own pleasure. Many people who may have already condemned or downvoted this review will have come to the conclusion that I simply didn't understand it. I assure you, I understood this film fully: it's just I felt throughout that I'd seen it before, that it was nothing special. The exception to this is of course the art design. While the CGI may not have aged well, the backgrounds and characters are things of beauty: I may not remember the protagonists name or personality amidst a sea of similar bad-ass, moody cyborgs, yet I'll remember how she was crafted. A shame that the animators appeared to have felt most comfortable drawing her naked, as I see no other reason for the constant nudity. Problems with the dub (of which there are many) have been excluded from my review, and on the whole the characters are well written, although they do sometimes stray off into exposition, as thought- provoking as it may be. As it stands, this is a fairly well done anime, but with annoying problems. And only the most die-hard weeaboo's would contend that the story is original in any way, shape or form.",Ghost in the Shell
276,jamesralong,A true classic,10,26 June 2015,"This film is regularly listed as an action sci-fi adventure because by Western animation standards the violence is gratuitous and the nudity is overt. However this is a huge injustice against a film that is staggeringly beautiful and brave enough to pose questions it knows that it can never answer.With the current rise of interconnected personal communication the ideas of complete identity theft, memory and record falsification and how governments monitor their citizens electronic behaviours are some of the most contentious issues facing the developed world today. Ghost in the Shell is not some dystopian nightmare but an exploration of the uncertainties that face our societies. Its genius is evident by the fact it predates many of the issues it raises.Do not watch this film expecting an action packed hour and a half of semi-clad cyborgs firing machine guns, you will be disappointed. Watch this film to be astounded and applaud a bravery that made a titan of science-fiction that never seeks to congratulate itself. The film and its creators have a permanent place in my heart, if you let it envelope you for an evening it will reward you for life.In fact I created an IMDb account just to praise it. After finding it on netflix and watching it despite promising myself I would go to bed. Although I own it on DVD and have seen it a dozen times. And I own the sequel (which is also superb), and the enthralling two season boxsets of it TV show spin off.",Ghost in the Shell
277,electronic_jim,"Yes, this movie rocks.",8,8 October 2006,"Just watched it dubbed last night. Absolutely fine.Movie was OK, better than most of the crap coming out of Hollywood, certainly more depth to the concept than 'Click', (just for instance, of course).Beats pants off 'A.I'. Nice to see where the Wackowski's sourced much of their material from.OK, so I was really quite drunk last night, and I'm gonna watch the movie again soon to enjoy it sober.Everything the other guy says about the scenic montage, that's true. These scenes reminded me of Myung-se Lee's Nowhere to Hide and the amazing shots of falling rain. It's a great opportunity to relax from the intense plot for a moment and just feel immersed in the characters world.On the other hand, and it may be the booze that experienced this, the concept of a 'ghost' is never defined (as far as I could tell at least), and it's up to the viewer to define this aspect for themselves. At least it's clear the characters understand what each other are talking about ! All in all a great movie and one I'd be happy to recommend.",Ghost in the Shell
278,wesbrown25,"Beautiful, philosophical, ahead of its time",9,10 April 2006,"I remember loving anime when I was about 13 and I especially loved this film. I watched it again recently and I have no idea how I understood it back then. To be honest I probably just liked the fact that it was a cartoon with violence. The second time round the film blew me away. Every part of it has been crafted beautifully, the animation is second to none, the futuristic city scape's are absolutely awesome and the computer sequences look like live action computers. The story is quite confusing, but like the best films it becomes much clearer the more you see it and each viewing offers new perspectives. The underlying themes to the film are what makes this film so good though. Clever usage of monologues delivered by cyborgs convey some deep philosophical thoughts on the nature of human life, things which I think we all wonder about sometime (well at least I hope we all wonder about). I'd recommend you watch this film in Japanese with the subtitles because I've watched both versions and some of the English dialogue is completely different to the subtitles (I think you should always watch a film as the creators planned it to be seen)some may find this a little difficult but it is well worth the extra effort. The only down point is that the film, at about 1hour 15minutes, is so short. But what is in the film is near perfection.",Ghost in the Shell
279,raptors_revenge,Visually stunning and incredibly deep masterpiece,10,13 May 2006,"It's not often that I see a film and straight away want to watch it again, but that's how I felt about Ghost in the Shell. As one of the most visually stunning anime movies for its time (and to date, in all honesty) and with an incredibly thought provoking story and world, this has to rank as a true masterpiece. Following the story of Motoko Kusanagi and Public Security Section 9 as they search for a criminal known as the puppet master, the film runs through a philosophical gauntlet that makes us consider what it is that actually makes us human.The superb characterisation in this film, especially of main characters Motoko, Batou, Togusa and Aramaki, makes it a real treat, as you really care about what happens to them as the movie progresses. Also, with a superbly atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the questioning nature of the film, it is a total experience, not let down by any aspect. As I said above, the animation in this film is beautiful, and I considered it the finest blending of conventional animation with CG animation I'd ever seen, until GitS 2: Innocence and Appleseed, though Appleseed is a different style altogether. Oh, and I know I've accentuated the thought provoking nature of the film above, but it is not simply a philosophical meander, instead being a tightly paced sci-fi thriller, with several intense action sequences that are superbly choreographed.As you might guess, I absolutely adore this film, having voted it my favourite movie of all time in more than one poll. If you haven't seen it, then do as soon as possible, because I guarantee that it'll blow your mind. A definite 10 star film.",Ghost in the Shell
