0,TheLittleSongbird,One of the year's biggest delights,9,10 November 2017,"Loved the first 'Paddington', was not sure whether that would be the case but it turned out to be one of that year's biggest surprises and delights. Was enthused about hearing that there was a sequel with the same crew returning, always a plus when it comes to sequels, but there was the concern as to whether it would fall victim to ""sequel-titis"".Very luckily, 'Paddington 2' does not fall victim to that. It is one of not many sequels to actually be equal in quality to its predecessor and come close to being even better. It maintains all of 'Paddington's' heart, fun and charm, maintaining everything that made that film so good, and even builds on that appeal. For such a hit-and-miss year and seeing my fair share of overblown big-budget blockbusters with little soul, films that waste great premises and films that attempted laugh-a-minute laughs and doing it in a way that came at the expense of heart, 'Paddington 2' was a much needed refreshment. Not saying at all that it has been a completely bad year, actually there have been very good to great films, just that 'Paddington 2' stood out in the best of ways in recent weeks.Maybe it could have been ever so slightly longer and would have again liked to have seen more of Mr Curry and his acrimonious relationship with Paddington. Everything else is magic.'Paddington 2' once again looks great. It's beautifully shot and vibrant in design with a little bit of grit and Paddington as to be expected couldn't have looked more perfect. The music score is suitably soothing, rousing and whimsical, while the direction keeps things moving at a bright and breezy pace. A pace that never slows down but doesn't ever feel too hasty either.Scripting is also spot on. The comedic moments are incredibly funny, the best of it hilarious, with rapid-fire wit, endearing quirkiness, clever gags that don't feel like pale retreads of before and perfectly pitched misunderstandings and physical comedy. Underneath all the humour and the darker and more suspenseful mystery/action-oriented elements of the story is a big heart and strong emotional core, with some lovely inspiring messaging and values that are very much current and some touching parts. It's also incredibly intelligent, not many films this year have treated its audience with the amount of respect that 'Paddington 2' has, and has such an endearing innocence.A large part of that is the character of Paddington himself. Can't fault his design or Ben Whishaw's beautiful voice acting, nor can one fault his truly adorable personality, absolutely love how he tries to still remain even in the grimmest of situations and he is easy to root for and love throughout. The story may on the slight side structurally but has a lot going on, without being cluttered, that makes it very much eventful and to me there weren't any tonal issues.Every ounce of the heart, charm and fun seen in 'Paddington' is here and everybody gets a chance to shine, especially Mr Brown and Mrs Bird of Paddington's family. The new characters are great additions, with a superior villain and the character of the cook Knuckles being one of the film's nicest surprises. Only Mr Curry could have been done better.Performances across the board are great. Hugh Bonneville balances comedy and drama with ease, Sally Hawkins is compassionate and Julie Walters is a hoot. Jim Broadbent is always a welcome presence and the younger actors are appealing. Brendan Gleeson excels in a departure role, a dramatic actor in a more comedic role in a family-friendly film could have gone wrong but Gleeson brings a curmudgeonly charm and great comic timing. Hugh Grant is also cast against type and brilliantly sends up himself and the world of acting. This is Paddington's film though.Overall, an absolute delight and refreshing. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Paddington 2
1,SnoopyStyle,sweeter than marmalade,8,11 March 2018,"Paddington is living happily with the Browns (Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville) in Windsor Gardens. He is beloved by most of his neighbors. Antique shop owner Samuel Gruber shows him a beautiful pop-up book of London and he has the idea to gift it to his beloved Aunt Lucy. Villain former actor Phoenix Buchanan (Hugh Grant) steals the book and Paddington is falsely imprisoned for the theft. Prison cook Knuckles McGinty (Brendan Gleeson) is taken with Paddington's marmalade sandwich and the bear is befriended by many of the prisoners. With the prisoners and the Browns' help, Paddington escapes and attempts to retrieve the book.The bear is adorable. It's just a joy to watch him. He has an undeniable sweetness that is sweeter than the amount of sugar in his marmalade. His quirky adventures are fun. There is a delightful visual touch. The live actors are terrific. It's fun for the whole family.",Paddington 2
2,Hitchcoc,Intelligent Children's Movie,9,26 December 2018,"I didn't see the first one, but was brought into the fold with the family at Christmas time. I wasn't expecting much. What I saw was a children's film that didn't insult one's intelligence. I remember Paddington from when I sold the books at a bookstore and the little bears (at exorbitant prices). The principle character is kind and believable. The supporting cast carries on in the world of Paddington. The scenes in the prison are hilarious, but he is always directing his efforts at being cleared of the crime for which he is accused. The plot is sophisticated without being maudlin or predictable. I will take an opportunity to watch the first one.",Paddington 2
3,Horst_In_Translation,About as entertaining as the first,6,7 December 2017,"Here we have ""Paddington 2"", the recent 2017 sequel to the 2014 film ""Paddington"". It runs for a bit over 100 minutes, which makes it slightly longer than the first and has Paul King return as director and one of the writers too. The original title character is by Paul Bond of course and he died not too long ago, so this film is dedicated to him. Like the first, nothing here is animated except the title character and he is voiced by Ben Whishaw again, in the German version by Elyas M'Barek and I must say I am positively surprised by his voice work here because honestly I am not a fan of his other stuff at all. Many actors from the first film return such as Gambon, Staunton, Walters and Hawkins and the latter is really having an amazing year with this one here, Maudie and the upcoming ""The Shape of Water"". Hugh Bonneville is back too and even he was tolerable despite me not being a fan of him at all, probably because of my strong dislike for Downton Abbey. But he has one of the funniest scenes, namely the yoga moment between the trains near the end.Anyway, after some attempts at finding a job that suits him, Paddington even ends up in jail where he meets Brendan Gleeson's character and quickly makes friends with him and some of the other inmates after initially things aren't looking too good when Paddington messes up everybody's laundry. This is also another comedy moment that turned out pretty memorable. Others were the hilarious quote by the old lady about how rotten actors are. Amazing self-mockery and the Casino Royale reference near the very end was brilliant too. The main antagonist this time is played by Hugh Grant and I like him a lot these days, also due to his recent performance in a film where he was clearly better than Meryl Streep. He was fun here too, even if I must say that overall his story line with the drama and crime references was not as convincing as I hoped it would be. But Grant still comfortably elevates the material. This film is at its very best really when it is all about the (situational) comedy, during these little moments full of wit and creativity that may not have a whole lot to do with the key plot, but add so much charm to this one.As a whole, you can certainly feel the heart in here. It is not emotional to an extent that your eyes will get wet, but you will be entertained from start to finish. You won't need to have read any of the books before checking this one out. I didn't do so myself before seeing this one here and the first film before that. Both are a success. I am glad a third film is already planned, but I would be surprised if they stopped it after this one I must admit. It seems just too big of a success. This is a good watch during the holidays, but don't mistake the animated main character as something from a film only younger audiences would enjoy. This is for the young ones, the old ones and everything in-between. A movie for all ages that succeeds with its clumsy title character as much as I hoped it would. Best-of-year material it is not, but without a doubt it is worth seeing and as a consequence, it gets a thumbs-up from me of course. Go check it out.",Paddington 2

5,jboothmillard,Paddington 2,9,30 November 2017,"The first movie, based on the books by Michael Bond (who sadly passed away), was a huge success, many were hoping that another outing with everybody's favourite furry friend would turn out as well, from Harry Potter producer David Heyman. Basically Paddington Brown (Skyfall's Ben Whishaw) has now settled with the Brown family in London's Windsor Gardens, and has become popular in his community, but neighbour Mr. Curry (Peter Capaldi) still distrusts him. The Browns have changed in many ways: mother/wife Mary (Sally Hawkins) wants to be an Olympic diver; father/husband Henry (Hugh Bonneville) misses out on a promotion at work; daughter Judy (Madeleine Harris) has started a newspaper; and son Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) has become a classic teenage boy. Paddington's Aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton) is due to celebrate her 100th birthday, she has never seen London, so Paddington finds the perfect present, a unique pop-up book of the city in the antique shop of Mr. Gruber (Jim Broadbent). The book is expensive, so Paddington tries to save money, doing various jobs, including a hairdressers, he finds a niche as a window-cleaner. The Browns go to the opening ceremony of a carnival, there Paddington meets egotistical actor Phoenix Buchanan (Hugh Grant), Paddington shares wit him the existence of the pop-up book, Buchanan recognises it. One day away from having enough money, Paddington witnesses a bearded thief, Buchanan, stealing the book from the antique shop, but Paddington is caught by police, he is presumed to be the culprit, and wrongfully convicted and detained. Whilst in prison, Paddington causes mishap with the laundry, the inmates are initially hostile towards him, including short-tempered chef Knuckles McGinty (Brendan Gleeson), but after tasting one of Paddington's marmalade sandwiches, Knuckles hires the bear to assist him in the kitchen. In the meantime, Buchanan follows clues in the pop-up book, the Browns are trying to prove Paddington's innocence, they meet the carnival fortune teller Madame Kozlova (Dame Eileen Atkins), she reveals the book has clues that will lead to a hidden fortune of the author, once the carnival's biggest star, killed by Buchanan's grandfather, but he never reached the treasure. With Paddington's efforts, the prison has become much more lively and comfortable, but he struggles to stay positive about his family proving his innocence. The Browns are convinced Buchanan may indeed be the culprit, being a master of disguise, Henry and Mary try to lure him out of his house and find the book, they find it in the attic, along with various costumes. Henry and Mary are caught by Buchanan, they manage to bluff their way out, but they realise they have missed the visiting session at prison, Paddington is left heartbroken, convinced the Browns have forgotten him. Paddington decides to join Knuckles, and some other prisoners, in a prison break, Knuckles promised to help Paddington clear his name, but promptly abandons him to leave the country, Paddington refuses the invite to join them. On the streets and avoiding the police, Paddington uses a public telephone to call the Browns, they eventually answer and insist they have not forgotten him, they tell him they know Buchanan is the real culprit, in order to catch him, they arrange to meet at Paddington Station, where the carnival train carrying the supposed location of the hidden fortune is due to leave. Paddington reaches the station and boards the train as it is leaving, the Browns pursue in another steam train on the opposite platform, Buchanan has boarded the train, the clues he found at the various London landmarks are musical notes, he finds the treasure inside the carnival organ, using the musical note sequence to open it up. But Paddington takes the pop-up book back before he can take the treasure, the Browns catch up to try and rescue Paddington, with Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters) and the children confronting Buchanan, he overpowers them and tries to escape, but he is knocked out by Henry. The trains are eventually parted, with Paddington trapped in the train's rear carriage, it crashes into a nearby river, Mary tries to swim down and save the bear from drowning, but cannot open the chained doors, but Knuckles and the other inmates show up, having had a change of heart, and help rescue Paddington from the water. Paddington becomes very ill following these events, but he recovers the day of Aunt Lucy's birthday, the book has been taken as evidence by the police, Paddington is upset not to have a present for his aunt, but he discovers the Browns and various people in the neighbourhood have worked together to give Aunt Lucy a great present, bring her to London to experience it for herself. In the end, Paddington and Aunt Lucy are in various photos enjoying the sights of London, Knuckles and the other inmates are pardoned, Knuckles opens his own tea room, and Buchanan is sentenced to a decade in prison, but he still stages an entertainment show for all the prisoners to lighten the mood. Also starring Sir Michael Gambon as Uncle Pastuzo, Joanna Lumley as Phoenix's agent Felicity Fanshaw, Tom Conti as Judge Gerald Biggleswade, Richard Ayoade as Forensic Investigator, Simon Farnaby as Barry the Security Guard, Sanjeev Bhaskar as Dr. Jafri, Ben Miller as Colonel Lancaster, Jessica Hynes as Miss Kitts, Robbie Gee as Mr. Barnes, Meera Syal as Prosecutor, Tom Davis as T-Bone, Noah Taylor as Phibs and Aaron Neil as Spoon. Whishaw is still perfect as the voice of the troublesome but adorable bear, Bonneville and Hawkins are still likable, Grant makes an amusingly flamboyant villain. As before, the special effects to bring the lead character to life and create many slapstick sequences are amazing, the story is really good fun, the script has many fantastic joke, it makes you laugh a lot, but is also charms and delights both the kids and the adults, I think it is even better than the original to be honest, a very British and highly enjoyable family comedy adventure. Very good!",Paddington 2
6,Quinoa1984,The definition of delight,9,15 January 2018,"So why should you see Paddington 2, whether or not you've seen Paddington from two years before? Two reasons immediately go to inspired casting - you think these should be too on the nose, but they take hold and revitalize these types: Brendan Gleeson plays a prisoner named 'Nuckles' (with an 'N') who gets persuaded in one swift stroke to start making marmalade sandwiches and Hugh Grant plays an egotistical over-the-hill actor who is a master of disguise (he goes from Alan Moore hobo to a nun). In other words, go see this bloody thing post-haste! It's a complete delight and it amps up the comedy in magnificent ways (a couple of set pieces are worthy of Harold Lloyd) while being wholly sincere, heartfelt (oh that ending) and about kindness and treating others as you would want to be treated. We so so SO need this right now in this world, for many reasons. I'm sure there are things about Paddington 2 that one can criticize it for as far as things one comes across in sequels -a familiar and somewhat predictable plot (what you expect happens when your protagonist gets framed and thrown in jail happens, up to a point, though everything has such a sweetness to it), and our family from the past movie, except maybe Hawkins, is now reduced more or less types (and then in that case there's good set up and pay off with them, albeit one has to suspend disbelief a couple if times)- but everything how the filmmakers are about this story is what counts. It's so difficult to have entertainment for kids or adults to be timeless, geuine and not talking down to any one group. This is that and then some. Paddington also ultimately works in a similar way as to why the Captain America movies (Winter Soldier and Civil War I mean): the hero is so good and decent and (frankly) square that everything he's reacting to, how those around Paddington make an impact on him or him on them, and that others get the arc even as Paddington stays steadfast in who he is. Characters like this almost give me a guilty conscience. After all, who wants to get the hard stare all the time?",Paddington 2
7,studioAT,Welcome back Paddington,7,22 December 2019,"The first 'Paddington' film was so warm and charming, not to mention a huge hit, that it was no surprise at all to see this sequel pop up.And in the best possible way it's much of the same, with all the returning faces helping the lovable bear as he gets into scrapes that this time see him in prison.The whole film though is stolen by a wonderful turn from Hugh Grant as the villain, showing once again he can do more than just rom-com's.A wonderful family film overall.",Paddington 2
8,writers_reign,"Trouble, Bruin>",3,17 December 2017,"For once I'm in accord with every account I've read here on imdb. This is a sequel that actually eclipses the original, making Paddington a really rare bear. There's a definite feel of 'real' England about it, evoking movies like Millions Like Us, Quiet Wedding, Brief Encounter, The Holly And The Ivy, all quintessentially English. Although very much of the age of cgi - in fact take the cgi away and there's no film - the technical and the live action merge to a fare-thee-well and from the above-the-title 'names' to the smallest cameo the 'live' actors complement a leading character that lacks only an ear adornment to be top-of-the-range Steiff.",Paddington 2
9,grantss,"Wonderfully funny, charming and entertaining",9,7 February 2019,"Happily living with the Browns in London, Paddington Bear is looking for a gift to give his adopted mother, Aunt Lucy, for her 100th birthday. He discovers the perfect gift but cannot afford it and is framed when it is stolen.Wonderfully funny, charming and entertaining. The first Paddington movie, from 2014, was great. At first glance a children's movie, it was great no matter what age you are. Solid plot and very funny, with a wonderful English whimsicalness and quirkiness.Paddington 2 takes that formula and improves upon it, ending even better than the initial movie, a rarity. Even funnier, even more emotional and the warmth, innocence and charm are all there too. Interesting, entertaining plot that moves at a brisk pace.Another factor in what makes Paddington 2 so great is the performance of Hugh Grant. He absolutely steals the show as the villainous Phoenix Buchanan.Superb movie, and suitable for all ages.",Paddington 2
10,oscaralbert,There's a lot more to this movie than might initially meet the eyes . . .,7,24 January 2018,". . . of those viewers unfamiliar with the humanitarian work of the studio that released it--the always prophetic Warner Bros.--which historically has served the dual role of entertaining the world with some of the best flicks ever made and warning Mankind--particularly its home nation America--of upcoming Calamities, Catastrophes, Cataclysms, and Apocalypti. Sometimes these cautionary story lines comprise the backbone of a movie, as was the case with the essential classic HEROES FOR SALE. However, much of the time Warner's warnings are seemingly buried deep within the fabric of a film, not unlike DVD or Video Game ""Easter Eggs."" In such cases, it's helpful to have the assistance of a trained specialist to interpret the fine points of a Warner movie's underlying messages. But it should go without saying that if Warner suddenly acquired the rights to churn out another Barney or Teletubby sequel, their effort would speak directly or peripherally about some major crisis facing our planet. Therefore, as you watch PADDINGTON 2, be sure to watch for the newspaper headline about 40:25 into this tale which reads something like ""Kushner accused of Putin's money laundering."" Certainly, the theme of PADDINGTON 2--""If we're kind and polite, the world will be right""--totally refutes the USA's Putin Administration, most particularly the so-called ""Tweet Storms"" from Vlad's Oval Office puppet, Jello the Hutt. One can glean at least 47 other Warner Bros.' warnings embedded into PADDINGTON 2 from the major Warnology web sites; the ones highlighted here are among the most telling.",Paddington 2
11,neil-476,A nearly perfect film,10,8 May 2018,"Small Peruvian floppy-hatted bear Paddington, now comfortably and lovingly ensconced with the Brown family, is looking to send a book to his Aunt Lucy. Unfortunately it contains clues to a treasure and Paddington ends up in prison, framed for a crime he didn't commit, while the real criminal is on the treasure trail. Can the Browns (and Paddington's fellow prisoners) obtain justice for the loveable little fellow?Well, no prizes for guessing the answer, but the journey to get to it is sheer delight from start to finish. The story, if improbable, is beautifully textured and works perfectly. The visuals are carried off peerlessly and the editing, particularly transitions between scenes, are imaginative and cleverly executed. The script, as well as telling the story well, is warm, witty, very funny (both verbally and sight gags), full of jeopardy and memorable characters: it is an object lesson in what a script should be.The cast are excellent. Ben Whishaw's voice acting is superb (there is an almost inaudible sigh at one point, touchingly subtle). And Hugh Grant is a revelation in an hilarious performance where he manages to spoof himself as well as demonstrating unsuspected versatility. His song and dance routine over the closing titles is hysterical.This is not only a wonderful family film, it is a wonderful film full stop, and I recommend it highly.",Paddington 2
12,ferguson-6,the kindest bear,8,12 January 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. The sequel to the hit 2014 PADDINGTON movie reunites most of the cast, as well as the director Paul King and his co-writer Simon Farnaby. Unfortunately, Michael Bond, Paddington Bear's creator and author of more than 150 affiliated books passed away in 2017, and was not able to see this most charming follow-up. The beloved little bear first hit UK bookstores in 1958 and has been part of the childhood of every generation of kids since. Now the movies have given life to the little bear with the red hat, blue coat and tiny suitcase.The entirety of the Brown family returns: Sally Hawkins as Mary, Hugh Bonneville as Henry, Madeleine Harris as Judy, Samuel Joslin as Jonathan, Julie Walters as Mrs. Bird, and Jim Broadbent as Mr. Gruber. Also back are Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon as the voices of Paddington's ""aunt"" and ""uncle"", and of course, Ben Whishaw returns as the familiar voice of the adored and oh-so-polite bear.Most notable among the new faces are Brendan Gleeson as Nuckles (that's with a capital N), and Hugh Grant as Phoenix Buchanan, this story's two-faced (and maybe more) villain. You've likely never seen the usually reserved and proper Mr. Grant in a role quite so colorful and flamboyant. He seems to be having a devilishly good time. As the movie begins, we are quickly assimilated into the community where Paddington has made such a difference. The core element to this bear is that he treats all with kindness and finds the best in each person. The results of this approach are clear in how his neighbors enthusiastically greet him each morning ... it's a reminder of the power of kindness. Only when Phoenix Buchanan's dastardly deed and actions catch Paddington in the crossfire does the film take an abrupt left turn from his blissful life.If the film has a flaw, it's in a story that is likely too complex and intricate for the youngest viewers to follow. However, it's that story that older kids (and grown-ups) will most appreciate and relate to. Younger kids may be lost at times, but there are enough visual pratfalls and bear hijinks to keep them oohing and aahing and laughing - I witnessed these reactions in a theatre that was about half-filled with kids.This sequel will probably be viewed as an improvement to what was a pretty entertaining original. There is enjoyment for all ages, and it's a rare combination of cuteness and charm with a strong message of kindness. If that's not enough for you, stay for the credits and take in the Bollywood-style musical number that will erase any doubts you might have had about Hugh Grant's commitment to the mission.",Paddington 2
13,JamesHitchcock,Paddington Does Porridge,8,1 December 2017,"The world created by the late Michael Bond in his ""Paddington"" books is much the same as our own except for one thing- bears are intelligent creatures who can talk and interact with humans. The books follow the adventures of one such bear, Paddington, who, although he is originally from Peru, now lives at 32 Windsor Gardens, London as part of the middle-class Brown family. The 2014 film about him was such a success that a sequel became inevitable. The films do not, however, use Bond's plots but are based upon original stories.In the first film, Paddington narrowly avoided being stuffed and turned into an exhibit in the Natural History Museum. In ""Paddington 2"" he finds himself in trouble with the law when a valuable book is stolen from Mr. Gruber's antique shop. Paddington falls under suspicion because he had expressed interest in purchasing the book as a birthday present for his Aunt Lucy. He is arrested and sent to prison. Can he establish his innocence and expose the real culprit, a vain and arrogant actor named Phoenix Buchanan, who has his own nefarious reasons for wanting the book? In the Bond universe, bears are not only intelligent, they are also (if Paddington is representative of the wider ursine community) endowed with many other admirable qualities. He is friendly, warm-hearted, loyal and generous and lives by a code of trying to see the best in everyone else- even the hardened prisoners he meets in jail. He manages to win their hearts when he gets a job as assistant to the prison cook and begins making them his delicious marmalade sandwiches. About the only people he is unable to win over are Buchanan and the Brown's unpleasantly arctophobic neighbour Mr Curry (played by former Doctor Who Peter Capaldi), but then every film these days- even family comedies- seems to need its antagonists. (Even the cast of ""My Little Pony"" divide up into heroes and villains).The film is an example of ensemble acting with several well-known British actors, including Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent. I felt that two contributions in particular stood out. One came from Brendan Gleeson as Knuckles McGinty, the outwardly thuggish but inwardly actually quite soft prison chef who befriends Paddington during his spell in jail. The other comes from Hugh Grant, although his is not a performance which will necessarily endear him to his fellow-members of the acting fraternity, as he plays Buchanan as a wildly over-the-top caricature of the actor as arrogant and self-indulgent luvvie. (This particular stereotype of the acting profession is by no means an uncommon one among the British public).Following the success of the ""Harry Potter"" series, there has been something of a vogue for British children's and young-adult fiction in the film world, and Paddington, with its lovable ursine hero, looks like becoming the next great British franchise, even though it is set in something much closer to the real world than the fantasy worlds of Rowling, Tolkien, Lewis and Pullman. 8/10",Paddington 2
14,lasttimeisaw,"PADDINGTON 2 amps up its aesthetic flair while cleaving to an unashamedly family-friendly tenet like its antecedent, a rare case of a sequel outdoes its predecessor",7,4 August 2018,"As a rule of thumb, like gold dust that a movie sequel can top its predecessor apropos of quality since it is disposed to rest on the latter's laurels, Paul King's PADDINGTON 2 is an exception, although if truth to be told, the first one doesn't necessarily set up a rather insuperable grade, itself is a passable family fare targeting audience of lower age group with a predilection for animated, fluffy anthropomorphic bears, still, this sequel manages to amp up its aesthetic flair while cleaving to an unashamedly family-friendly tenet like its antecedent. Paddington (voiced by Whishaw, proffering soothing cadence to a jaded ear), now lives harmoniously with the Browns, and buckles down in earning enough dinero to buy a pop-up book of London for his auntie Lucy's (Staunton) upcoming centennial birthday, only is summarily sent to the prison under wrongful conviction of pilfering the said book, whereas the Browns are concertedly combing through clues to sniff out the real burglar, a narcissistic has-been actor Phoenix Buchanan (Grant), who believes the book will lead him to a hidden treasure which can resurrect his dead-end career from debasing dog-food commercials.Apart from several endearing comic skits (including one about Paddington working in a barbershop) and a stupendous passage in the pop-up book with cut-outs, it is Paddington's penitentiary adventure inducing most amazement from disbelief-suspending spectators, not just for its knowing emulation of Wes Anderson's THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014), in particular, the cliché jail-springing sequences, interlaced with a homage to Chaplin's MODERN TIMES (1936), but also the candy-striped tableaux, the epicurean revamp of the ghastly prison menu and Paddington's new-found friendship with a fellow jailbird, the rough diamond Knuckles (a disarmingly huff-and-puff Gleeson in a cook's hat), all bundled together to melt our hearts with its salutary if saccharine condiments.The original cast returns with upgraded fervor to right any wrong standing in their way, Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Brown is submersed into another waterlogged scenario to rescue a beloved one, and a starchy Hugh Bonneville is tasked with a split leap to bowl audience over, but the spotlight is resoundingly cast upon the newcomer, Grant's delectably cutesy antagonist, burlesquing away in full throttle, and belatedly, ludicrously finds his feet and audience when being cooped up, please stay put when the closing credits roll.Apparently, Paddington's bearish otherness is a thinly veiled metaphor of an immigrant of any persuasions, PADDINGTON 2 reinforces the benign message of inclusion and acceptance that propitiously, may sow its seeds in any labile young hearts of its core audience, a beneficial indoctrination by way of fairy-tale artifice, that ought to summarize its universal appeal and grant a pardon for its blatant wanderlust endorsement suspiciously bankrolled by London's tourism bureau.",Paddington 2
15,Hellmant,"It's hard to say anything negative about it really, but it's not as good as the critics say it is.",7,24 January 2018,"'PADDINGTON 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the 2014 hit kids' film 'PADDINGTON', which is based on the classic 'Paddington Bear' children's book series (by Michael Bond). In this adventure Paddington has adapted to living with the Brown family, in Windsor Gardens, and is framed for stealing a unique London pop-up book, that he was saving up to buy for a family member. Actors Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent, Peter Capaldi, Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, Imelda Staunton and the voice of Ben Whishaw all reprise their roles. Hugh Grant and Brendan Gleeson join the cast this time around as well. It's gotten unanimously positive reviews from critics so far, and it's also another hit at the Box Office as well. I mildly enjoyed it.Paddington (Whishaw) has now adapted to living with the Brown family, who all now accept him for who he is. He's still extremely clumsy though, and he's always causing messes because of it. Paddington is also doing a lot of extra work, in order to save up money to buy a unique pop-up book of London for his aunt. When the book is stolen, Paddington is arrested for the crime and it's up to the Brown family to find the real culprit and save him. The movie is good old classic family movie fun. It's hard to say anything negative about it really. At the same time though, it's not as good as the critics say it is. I don't really think there's much to it. It's cute, funny and sweet, and kids should definitely find it amusing. There's not a lot more to it than that though. I also didn't think much of the original film either.",Paddington 2
16,Lejink,Grin and bear it,5,7 January 2019,"A second, fun romp for Paddington Bear, let loose this time in London although he manages to lose his freedom for a time too. He still belongs to the eccentric Brown family, pines after his soon-to-be-centenarian Aunt Lucy back in the jungle and still craves marmalade sandwiches. The point is cleverly made that his good deeds have endeared him to the family's neighbours apart of course from Peter Capaldi's crotchety old Mr Currie, underlying the morals of the film that no good deed goes unnoticed and that to love thy neighbour is a decidedly good thing, indeed the travelling calypso band even co-opts the theme tune to the same-name 70's TV series at one point to push home the message.
This time the capped and coated bear's scrapes take him to a revivalist steam fair, a spell in jail and a finale involving a steam train racing a contemporary passenger train, before there's a happy Bears Reunited conclusion just as you'd expect.
The cast all fling themselves happily into their parts, with Hugh Grant sending himself up as the pantomime villain of the piece as a greedy old-fashioned luvvy-actor type, never dressed without a cravat, in thrall to his gods Larry and Johnny and there are several other identifiable cameos from British cinema and TV, amongst them Tom Conti, Joanna Lumley and Eileen Atkins. Nice to see Jessica Hynes sharing the screen again with her old W12 boss Hugh Bonneville too.
Some of the animation is very imaginative, such as Paddington's pop-up book tour of London, the flashback circus sequence and the chase at the end but I found this sequel slightly less entertaining than its predecessor, with less laugh-out-loud gags, a less exciting conclusion and perhaps just over-familiarity with the main characters and even the bear himself.
Still, it was pleasant family viewing although I'm not sure there's quite enough marmalade left in the jar to eke out one more edible sandwich next time around.",Paddington 2

The difference between this and the first is that these skits are strung together with more of an actual story. It's quite a bit funnier, too. Though it's still light on specific plot-points and unsurprisingly plays it pretty safe, this more focused narrative allows the title to retain the good-natured charm and breezy flow of the original while feeling like there's more of a fluid through-line that eventually brings its expected themes of friendship, family and just being downright decent to one another together with a final moment that is much more emotionally impactful than you'd perhaps expect it to be. Yet, for all the film's general improvements, least of all its entertainingly self-absorbed and avant-garde villain who's portrayed knowingly ostentatiously and is a true highlight, the feature does oddly sideline most of its core characters (even if they do all get a similar amount of screen time), to the point that most of them just aren't developed nearly enough. Even the eponymous polite protagonist doesn't really have an arc, leading to a sometimes dragged out piece that could maybe have benefited from being trimmed slightly to just include the bare necessities. Still, it's wonderfully wholesome. 7/10.",Paddington 2

Better yet, I'm not sure I can even imagine a film that more deftly balances adventure, comedy, and touching drama. Paddington 2 is as close to a flawless film as I can remember over the last few years. Sure, I'm never going to compare it to say a film like The Dark Knight or The Lion King (two perfect films in my opinion), Paddington 2 succeeds the same way those films did, by knowing their audience and making a film that benefits the entire crowd. Sure, Paddington 2 may have been made for children, but it can be enjoyed by people (and bears) of all ages.Now comfortable in his human home, Paddington now set his hopes on buying his Aunt Lucy the best birthday present. To do that, he must make some money and pick up a series of jobs to raise the $. Window Washing and barbery are among the jobs he takes on, and as you can imagine, these make for some hilarious physical gags from Paddington. Something the first film was no stranger to either. However, the book he worked so hard to get was stolen and Paddington was in turn framed for stealing in. And so begins his stint in prison. A bear in prison with a bunch of criminals? Yes, that's also a perfect opportunity to create some fantastic slapstick humor. Even with all the humor, the film never loses sight of its heart. As Paddington spends his nights in a cell, his human family works their hardest to get him out with the help of the neighborhood that has learned to love him. Sweet, charming, innocent without becoming childish, Paddington 2 is a heartwarming delight.

Both visually and in the dialogue, there are countless little details to delight the observant viewer, which undoubtedly helps it appeal to all ages.

It truly is one of the best movies of all time. It's the best movie I've seen in theaters in 2018! Granted, it's the only one I've seen in theaters in 2018. What makes this movie so amazing is that it completely avoids so many traps bad movies fall into. There's no attempt at all to change anything to be relevant in modern times, nor are there any fart jokes or songs about big butts. I've seen all the bad stuff Yogi Bear has gotten himself into. Some bears just have more dignity. What's great is how amazingly happy this movie is. Unlike a glurge, it doesn't hide a darker hidden meaning with its happiness, but instead gives us a truly heartwarming experience. Most of the movie actually features Paddington in jail, which isn't mentioned in most plot explanations of the film. There's tons of great, light hearted jokes too. I feel bad for not crying in certain moments, especially this one scene at the end I won't spoil. Paddington truly looks like he's right there and not just a special effect. The voice is amazing and the entire cast is giving it all they have. The length is perfect and so is the pacing.

24,lesleyharris30,"An Incredibly Pleasing Sequel,",9,14 January 2018,"Paddington 2 is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is one of those rare instances where the sequel lives up to the expectations of its inpressive predecessor. This is just as delightful and funny as the first Paddington, in fact, I would say it is even better, the whacky slapstick is still there, with many brilliantly comedic sequences, while also never forgetting to have heart and meaning. The only problem I really had is that the Brown family felt a little pushed to the side this time around. While they are still in it quite a bit, their dialogue felt a bit more throwaway and more so serving as plot development. The cast is absolutely fantastic and fit in to this wonderfully flamboyant world perfectly. Ben Whisaw still shines as Paddington, a casting so perfect, I find it hard to believe it was made at the last minute, Hugh Boneville and Sally Hawkins make a splendid return as Henry and Mary Brown, respectively. However, the newcomers really steal the show here, Brendan Gleeson is thrilling and has a terrific presence as Knuckles, while Hugh Grant, the highlight for me, delivers what is honestly my favourite performance in his entire career thus far. Grant has an irrestibly delightful confidence as Phoenix Buchanen, and his costume changes were the best part of this film for me, he surprised me from beginning to end. A great romp for the whole family. Funny, thrilling and heartwarming, Paddington 2 does not disappoint, and I would highly recommend it to the whole family.

Go see it NOW NOW NOW,10,16 January 2018,"In London, Paddington Bear (voiced by Ben Whishaw) has fit in nicely with the Brown family after they rescued him in the first film. Mother B (Sally Hawkins), Father B (Hugh Bonneville) and the kids adore him, as does their lodger, Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters). Not only that, the neighborhood loves him, too, as he keeps businessmen from forgetting their keys, matchmakes for the lovelorn, and so on. Friends give him rides on bicycles and garbage trucks so Paddington can visit his favorite antiques store, run by Mr. Gruber (Jim Broadbent). The only one who seems to treat the wee bear badly is aging actor Phoenix (Hugh Grant), a neighbor who, if truth be told, only loves himself. This changes on a fateful day. Paddington happens to mention to Phoenix that he has found the perfect birthday gift for his Aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton) back in her home in deepest, darkest Peru. Its an old pop-up book about London and its so valuable that Paddington is working many odd jobs to pay for it. ( What a treat to see Paddington flounder at a hair salon and a window washing company). But, ho ho ho, Phoenix knows about this book and HE STEALS IT, in an actor's disguise even though Paddy is a witness. Police don't believe the little bear's description of the true thief and send P to prison for ten years. Soon, Paddington is transforming the gruff fellow prisoners with his kindness and the Brown family is trying to find the real crook for they believe their beloved adopted ursa minor. Can they find the real culprit? This absolutely darling film is one of the best family movies in the last 30 years. It has everything, a stellar cast, a tremendous script, a visionary art direction and a strong direction. Special mention should go to Grant for his fabulous turn as the jaded Phoenix! What, you don't think this could be as good as a Disney or Pixar film? Think again, ITS BETTER!",Paddington 2
26,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,25 April 2018,"Paddington 2Bears make great house pets until they wake from hibernation bloodthirsty.Fortunately, the Ursa Minor in this animated-comedy can be easily overpowered.Entrenched in the fabric of the Brown family (Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins), domesticated bear Paddington (Ben Whishaw) hopes to show his appreciation to his human hosts by buying his adoptive aunt (Imelda Staunton) an antique pop-up book for her birthday.
 
But when the tome turns up missing from Mr. Gruber's (Jim Broadbent) shop, Paddington is sent to prison, while the real culprit uses the manuscript to locate lost treasure.Charming as ever, this delightful sequel to the pleasantly surprising original adaptation of the kid lit favourite is as brilliant as the first. While the computer rendering of the titular character remains hyper-realistic, the family friendly storyline is even more thoughtful while the supporting human cast is hilarious.Moreover, incarcerating bears is a surefire way to solve prison overpopulation.

27,westsideschl,Weak Effort,5,11 May 2018,"First, it's a bland formula storyline. Lost treasure to be found in old book found in, of course, an antique store. 
Second, blandly bad were the characterizations especially Hugh Grant putting in a weak effort to semi play himself as a self-centered washed up actor which judging from his acting here isn't that far off. 
Third, lots of stereotyped characters in stereotyped roles e.g. prisoners as Paddington foils. 
Fourth, the worst part was the unimaginative unwillingness to spend time & money to upgrade the CGI animation quality i.e. compared to, let's say, Peter Rabbit. 
Fifth, also unlike PR, the song & dance, a mainstay of such animations, was a weak half-hearted effort.

28,tabuno,Entertaining mystery thriller along with some nice creative special effects,8,28 January 2019,"Instead of the cute and funny introduction of Paddington to the odd ways of humans from his first movie, Paddington 2 introduces him to a comical mystery thriller. With his usual innocent bear charm and grace and naivete, Paddington brings his seemingly gracious personality and his touch of innocence to his neighbors and even to a prison. Hugh Grant (in place of the nefarious character of Nicole Kidman) gets to strut his stuff in various guises and even gets to end the movie with the closing credits. Peter Capaldi (of Dr. Who fame) gets to be the irritating odd neighbor out in his distinct distaste for the little bear. And Sally Hawkins claim to fame as Paddington's adopted mother is her role in her Oscar nominated best actress portrayal in The Shape of Water released the same year. Paddington 2 is entertaining along with some nice creative special effects with the various set designs, especially the moving three-dimensional pop-up scenes. The storyline holds together pretty well though the prison elements at times border on a rather questionable portrait of prison life and its inmates that could be taken as offensive by some. What really shines through on the screen is Paddington and how he touches the heart of the people around him and the humor comes not from some odd sense of screw up but rather from his innocence.",Paddington 2

It has more adventure and is a more ambitious project, but a lot less substance. This film is purely comical and a lot more slapstick, with the absence of emotional depth I so enjoyed from the first film. I also did not enjoy Hugh Grant as the antagonist, who was much too lighthearted to be considered a villain. 'Paddington 2' will definitely be more enjoyed by a younger demographic.

33,tomgillespie2002,"A charming, hilarious and superior sequel",8,18 March 2018,"Paul King's Paddington was one of the great surprises of 2014: a re-imagining of a world-famous character beloved not only to children, but to the adults who grew up reading Michael Bond's stories or watching the various television incarnations since the 1970s. Aesthetically, it shared very little in common with the charmingly old-fashioned and quaint little adventures penned by Bond and illustrated by Peggy Fortnum, but shared much of its heart. Most who saw Paddington fell quickly under its spell, which was a wonderful amalgamation of Wes Anderson and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's proudly artificial visual splendour and the stiff upper lipped playfulness of Ealing Studios. This sequel's arrival is more than welcome, if not only to make us forget what's happening out there in the real world, but to allow us to spend more time in the company of Ben Whishaw's endearingly clumsy yet optimistic bear.In almost every way, Paddington 2 is an improvement on its predecessor. The return of King and his co-writer Simon Farnaby is a no-brainer, and they have not only grown in confidence and in their willingness to push their kooky boundaries even further, but they have fixed what was arguably a weak link first time around - the villain. Nicole Kidman had a ball as evil taxidermist Millicent Clyde, but here they have tried something less terrifying for kids in Phoenix Buchanan, a washed-up thespian who dreams of bringing his one-man show to the West End, but finds himself in humiliating dog-food television adverts instead. Casting Hugh Grant was a stroke of genius, and it's no stretch to say that this is the finest he has ever been. He's pompous and full of himself, but takes pride in his ability to disappear into his characters. His desire to spark his festering career back to life leads to the theft of a valuable pop-up book from the store of Mr. Gruber (Jim Broadbent), which holds clues to the location of a treasure chest hidden somewhere in London.Phoenix Buchanan may steal the film, but the attention rarely strays too far from the titular hero, who is once again voiced pitch-perfectly by Whishaw. He was Colin Firth's last-minute replacement first time around when the Kingsman actor's efforts didn't quite feel right, and it's difficult to imagine any other actor behind Paddington's soft features and wide-eyed curiosity. When we first meet him, it's clear that the charming little bear's community wouldn't quite function without him. The Brown family, again played by Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Julie Walters et al, are happily getting on with their lives, although dad Henry is experiencing a midlife crisis at work and with his ageing appearance. With Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday coming up, Paddington finds the perfect present in the pop-up book of London in Mr. Gruber's store, which he hopes will compensate for the elderly bear never being able to see the big city for herself. He starts to work odd jobs to save up for the pricey gift, but all suspicion falls on Paddington when Buchanan steals the book for himself.He is sentenced to ten years in prison for the crime, and if that seems unnecessarily harsh, you'll understand why when you see the film. This may seem like a somewhat grim direction for a family film to take, but thanks to a mishap involving a stray red sock in the laundry room, the scenes within the jail are some the film's funniest. This is also thanks to the character of Knuckles McGinty, the fearsome chef played brilliantly by Brendan Gleeson who Paddington naturally befriends over some marmalade sandwiches. Paddington 2 is unashamedly fanciful stuff, presenting a fantasy vision of London where the sun always shines and people on the street always greet you with a smile. It's an image many foreigners will no doubt have of the capital, but there's nothing wrong with playing up to this, especially when the film's fantasy sequences are quite as wonderful as they are. Production designer Gary Williamson and animation director Pablo Grillo are a crucial part of this, and King, who always displayed a flair for the fantastical in his early TV work, surely also had a hand in Paddington 2's overall magical feel.",Paddington 2

I personally wasn't expecting that much from this film but I found it quite entertaining, and the storyline was well put together. I also enjoyed the first movie but I didn't think that they could have done anything interesting with a sequel but now that I've watched it, I have to say that I surprisingly found it refreshing and quite funny in parts. If you have seen the first movie, this film see's Paddington settled with the Brown Family, and he has become a popular member of the community. He picks up odd jobs to try and buy a pop-up book for his Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday present but the book gets stolen, and he gets accused of the crime. All of the evidence points to Paddington, and he ends up serving time, while his family try and find the culprit who stole the book. Whilst in jail, Paddington becomes friends with the scary cook, Knuckles McGinty (Brendan Gleeson), and they soon realise that the only way that Paddington can prove his innocence, is by breaking out of jail. Meanwhile, the Brown family delve deeper into the crime, and they find out that the book is actually a map to priceless treasure but when they workout who is causing the crimes, they have to fight against time to try and stop him. There is definitely something for everyone in this film, and all of the performances were top form, especially from Brendan Gleeson and Hugh Grant. The CGI was also top form, and it really did seem like the little bear was in the room in every scene. The dramatic ending was pretty unrealistic but still enjoyable, if you don't take it seriously, so it's definitely worth a watch if your in the mood for light-hearted fun. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Paul King, who also brought you the first Paddington movie, along with Bunny and the Bull and many projects with the Mighty Boosh comedians. Judging by the profit of this movie made at the box office, I think that the audience was happy with this sequel, and I personally haven't heard a bad word said about it, so for a director who hasn't worked on many movie projects, he must be happy with this franchise. He is currently working on a movie about a young Willy Wonka and how he met the Oompa-Loompas, which should be interesting but there isn't any talk about a 3rd movie Paddington movie yet.Budget: $40million

Its predecessor took me by surprise and is an excellent British family flick. Here we are, with a sequel that I didn't see coming but thankfully...we have one. In this chapter, Paddington is framed for robbery and must adjust to prison life. Meanwhile, the Brown's attempt to prove Paddington's innocence by searching for the real culprit. I can safely say, without a doubt, equally as likeable as the first film. I had a smile consistently on my face throughout its entire runtime. Bear plus marmalade plus British mannerisms equals magnificent family flick. We all know Paddington as a character is hugely entertaining. His clumsiness and curiosity create many adventurous scenes that are filled to brim with smart witty humour that everyone can enjoy. That is what is so great about these, highly accessible and watchable for all. Very difficult to find these days. The array of British talent is overwhelming. The Brown's are perfectly cast and perform just as well as last time. Small supporting characters were fantastic, particularly Brendan Gleeson. The stand out though...get ready...Hugh Grant. The perfect pantomime performance. Who knew he would make for such a hilarious antagonist. The accents. The costumes. I could tell he was having fun, and it was contagious. Solid direction yet again with various creatively shot sequences. The blend of animation and reality was flawless, Paddington is as cute as ever. Plenty of humour, a highlight being a clumsy scene in a barbershop, which everyone can appreciate. Sometimes old school slapstick is the best. There aren't really any morals, unlike the first film, for younger audiences to take away and a few loose ends that were not tied up.

Armed with a pleasant cast of characters (even the unsavory ones), plus a wonderful sense of humor, it spins a simple yarn with elementary motives that still manages to charm and surprise. It's also unexpectedly well-crafted in a technical sense, with a sharp photographic eye and ornate attention to detail that must have been inspired by Wes Anderson.Yes, it's a family movie. I'd like to think Pixar has stomped many of those preconceptions to death by this point, but if you still can't get past the idea of talking bears in people clothes, that's your loss.

Paddington wishes to purchase the book to send it to his aunt for her birthday. However, this rare pop-up-book includes hints to a treasure a reckless thief wants to find. He steals the book and vanishes but Paddington, who was close to the scene of the crime and even followed the mysterious thief, gets accused of a crime he didn't commit. Paddington is found guilty and has to get used to life in jail while the Brown family tries to clear his name and find the actual culprit.Watching this movie is an almost spiritual trip as the young bear uncovers the biggest flaws and strengths of mankind and makes each and every human being he meets better. It's also incredibly entertaining to see the young bear in prison, escape from it and go on an adventurous train rain. The movie finds a perfect balance between amusing moments such as Paddington washing clothes in prison and serious elements like seeing the young bear facing a court trial. Paddington 2 is an incredibly creative, emotional and life-affirming ride that any human being with a heart and soul should watch. I'm saying this as someone who usually loves to watch quite sinister and tense films and who doesn't appreciate most children's movies. Watching this movie is like becoming a child again, full of ambition, curiosity and innocence. You need to watch this movie and discover or re-discover the amazing Paddington franchise. Rest in peace and thank you, Michael Bond, inventor of Paddington Bear.",Paddington 2

46,peterp-450-298716,A truly enjoyable and charming family movie suitable for all ages,7,3 January 2018,"""Paddington wouldn't hesitate if any of us needed help!
He looks for the good in all of us.""We have an annual tradition. The last day of the year we go to the cinema with the whole family to end that year with a cozy family film. This year the kids had their minds set on an adventure of the adorable and over-friendly British bear Paddington. To be honest, I was reluctant to watch this movie and I intended to use the full duration of this film to make up for my sleep shortage caused by the Christmas holiday. But I have to admit that I actually enjoyed Paddington's adventure. Better yet, there were even times when I laughed out loud. And believe me, that isn't something I do often during a film.
A good indication wether the film was a success or not, are my two children. Full of excitement they were watching the film without fidgeting in their chairs and without nagging for another snack constantly. I hadn't seen Paddington's first film, unlike my two little brats. I can only remember the hilarious bathroom scene where a terrible amount of water was used. I was hoping this film would be packed with such crazy situations and that it wouldn't be a corny, honeyed tearjerker. And you can rest assured. There are plenty of those crazy situations. From the beginning it became clear that we would see a series of visual jokes Buster Keaton would be jealous about. From two adult bears rescueing young Paddington in the Amazon forest to the mess Paddington caused during the execution of his jobs. Jobs that he has to carry out so he can buy a huge picture book for his aunt's birthday. A picture book that has hints so you could find a treasure (something Paddington doesn't know of course).
In terms of acting, it's mainly that of Hugh Grant and Brendan Gleeson I liked the most. Hugh Grant as the narcissistic-minded Phoenix Buchanan whose house is full of self-portraits. Perhaps the subtle humor won't be noticed by the younger viewers, but the way the actor Buchanan demonstrates the exaggerated portion of self-mockery, can be called truly brilliant. Obviously, the way he tries to discover the clues in several London landmarks is rather exaggerated. But the entertainment value is of a very high level. It 's also a joy to watch Brendan Gleeson as Knuckles McGinty. He's the frightening cook in the kitchen of the prison where Paddington ended up. And he runs that kitchen like a real tyrant. The fact that Paddington's fellow prisoners look rather pink in their prison outfit because of Paddington's clumsy behavior and then they demonstrate their pastry skills, isn't top-class humor either. But again, the entertainment value is shockingly high.
All in all, this is a successful family film every person of any age can enjoy. And the release date is also chosen strategically. After all, it's the Christmas period. However, I don't think it will match the success of ""Home Alone"". I'm sure we'll still see the latter on a multitude of television channels every year. Unfortunately, because I like a bit of variety. I had a double feeling about the ending. At first I thought it was an artificial trick to get the audience into a sentimental mood. But then it took a completely different turn when I heard the reaction of my youngest son, who, after his mother told him how it would end, replied surprised : ""How did you know that, mum ?"". At that moment I think jealousy came into play. I realized that I had lost the wondering and amazement that a child experiences. I am rarely surprised by a film. Most of the times I can predict the ending of a film in advance and I realize afterwards that I'm analyzing the film instead of enjoying it. And that little boy is overwhelmed by that self-evident ending. A film with lovely Paddington made me realize this. A film is a weird medium.

47,adamjohns-42575,Needs more Marmalade!,1,26 July 2021,"I didn't mind the first Paddington film that much at all, although I don't think it really did Mike's work a lot of justice. But this second instalment was all just daftness!It may appeal to children, but it doesn't have anything for the adults who have to sit through it! And even then I think the children would struggle with it. To say that the prison scene was far fetched is an understatement, even for a kids film.It's jam packed full of celebrities and I think that it's a travesty that some of them will always have their names attached to this film. Also it might be time for Jim Broadbent to stop trying to do accents?The best bit was the end and not just because it was finally over, but because Hugh Grant's final scene is what the whole film should have been like.The only nice touches were the bits when the band played.Even my Mother, the eternally child like mind said she never wanted to watch it again. And she used to get up early to watch Peppa Pig and Noddy, not that long ago.084.15/1000.",Paddington 2

50,jadepietro,Spirited Family Fun,8,4 July 2018,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Beary charming.JIM'S REVIEW: Paddington 2 is wonderful family fare. This sequel, solidly directed again by Paul King, still loses its way a bit in its contemporary updating, but it has enough visuals to continually delight. Spirited sight gags and slapstick moments are aplenty. The CGI is consistently strong and the voiceover work by Ben Whishaw is superb in its childlike wondrous vocal tones as our furry idealist. The animation, a mix of stop motion, computer generated, and hand-drawn renderings, is impressive. (Perhaps the film's highlight involved Paddington's imaginative journey in a pop-up book world that is stunningly conceived and executed. The cinematography by Erik Wilson flows with its aerial views and kinetic lensing. Gary Williamson's production direction, very reminiscent of Wes Anderson's The Great Budapest Hotel with its pink and teal palette, is cleverly detailed and its surreal dollhouse settings hide its rather standard plot-driven screenplay by Simon Farnaby and the director. Dario Marianelli's jaunty score adds a perfect touch of whimsy.The story involves Paddington's goal to buy an antique book for his aunt's 100th birthday. He decides to take various jobs to earn money with madcap antics in tow. However, he is not the only who wants this tome. Enter Hugh Grant as Phoenix Buchanan, a has-been actor and master of disguises, who plans to steal the valuable text and has Paddington framed for the crime. Villainy is foremost to make Paddington's travails remotely entertaining and Mr. Grant as the hammy thespian is a joy. His comic performance adds a certain vaudeville flavor and cartoonish conflict that works beautifully.The perfectly British cast is a gathering of today's film royalty with the likes of Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent, and Tom Conti. Their roles are subservient to our animated hero and their characters lack any real sense of interest; they are only props in the plot mechanism that runs this machine. In fact, the Brown family and their neighbors somewhat slow down the action. One major exception in the human cast, beside the aforementioned Mr. Grant: Brendan Gleeson creates an extremely memorable character as hardened criminal, Knuckles McGinty, who develops a soft spot for Mr. Bear. Paddington 2 is deliciously charming. Simply said, it is as sweet and smooth as orange marmalade.",Paddington 2

--Animation/Acting
--Cute
--Engaging Characters
--Story/PresentationDISLIKES:--Predictable
--Character Stupidity
--Expanding More  It's hard for an animation feature to stand out against the mega studio of Disney, but Paddington 2 is one of those movies that delivers on the family adventure genre. Once more, the adorable little bear is beautifully animated in both design and movement to bring the novel character to life. Our real-life cast seems to have no problems interacting with the animation, crafting a good family that feels like a more realistic Hallmark family. Of course, the movie is cute, as most kid's movies are, but Paddington 2 is also able to craft a few engaging characters for older audience members to latch onto in the 2-hour run period. The story itself, while not unique, is very heartfelt, capable of getting the waterworks going while also entertaining to watch as well. Having three stories also running in tandem with each other, was also a dynamic way to keep the story moving and integrate a plethora of characters. 
 Despite all this though, Paddington 2 suffers from predictability, unable to insert the twists to provide shock and awe most likely out of fear it would go too dark. In addition, after everything the first installment accomplished, the characters turned abruptly stupid/cowardly to actually stand up for the little guy. Why the change of face? Simple, to set up 2/3 of the story arcs, but it's a stretch you have to make. Finally, some of the new gimmicks needed expansion on to help with character development and make their hiring worth the extra investment. I feel this movie did a little too much at times, flying over some key moments that could have made for adventurous obstacles. 
 I was very pleased with Paddington 2, and feel this is the perfect movie for family and friends to enjoy. While cute, Paddington does a nice job bringing the deeper emotions for the adult population to take in, while the kids laugh at the adorable slapstick. Again, it's not the most original or surprising movie, but the film's presentation and story are enough to make up for this, even though it need a little expansion to improve our characters. This reviewer does agree though that his film is one worth hitting the theater to see and the new movie of the weekend. Otherwise, definitely look for it on Redbox. My scores: 
Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0",Paddington 2
54,rannynm,Hilarious and Charming. Great Family Film,10,13 December 2017,"This film is hilarious and made me cry a cry of joy and also of sadness, multiple times. It is amazing to watch live characters bond with an imaginary, animated bear. Even though there's not actually a bear there, you can feel the love within the family.The film starts off with a little flash back showing how Paddington was saved from falling off the waterfall when he was a cub, by Uncle Pastuzo and Aunt Lucy. They adopted him and raised him as if he was their own son. Then it returns to present time. Paddington wants to get the perfect gift for Aunt Lucy on her 100th Birthday and decides on a present, but it is expensive. He works hard to earn enough money to buy the gift. One night while he is walking past the store where the gift is, a thief breaks into the store and steals it. Paddington chases after the burglar, but when the police arrive they assume that he is the thief. Paddington is sentenced to 10 years in prison even though he didn't commit the crime. His family tries to prove his innocence, but they don't have much evidence.Paddington (Ben Whishaw) is supposed to be a young bear. Ben Wishaw, who does his voice, doesn't sound like a young bear to me. He sounds more like a polite and proper man. Even though he doesn't sound young, his voice matches Paddington's personality, particularly because Paddington is very polite, kind and sweet. The animation for this film is very realistic. Paddington interacts with objects that aren't animated, which makes him seem like he is actually there. Paddington looks very realistic with very detailed fur, eyes and feet. My favorite part of this film are all of the jokes throughout it. They are so funny and sarcastic. The whole audience was laughing together. Everyone understood the jokes, adults and children both, which is always great. The moral of this story is to be kind and positive, so that life will be kind and positive to you. Throughout all the hardships that Paddington goes through, he stays positive, remains kind and eventually everything becomes right in the end. Paddington 2 is such an amazing film to watch with your whole family. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 3 to 18, as well as adults. It opens in theaters nationwide on January 12, 2018 so, go check it out.",Paddington 2
55,bkrauser-81-311064,The Rare Sequel That Improves Upon the First,8,19 January 2018,"As hacky is it is to start a review comparing a new movie to food, the charm of this one pretty much begs for it. Thus if all family-oriented adventure films are to be compared to some form of cheese, Paddington 2 is like an artisanal muenster in that it is immediately engaging, rich with flavor and has a potential for gooeyness but never goes overboard. Also, orange rinds have something to do with it.This film starts with the well-meaning Peruvian bear happily acclimated and settled with the Brown family in their posh and homey London neighborhood. As a bastion of courteousness, Paddington (Whishaw) still sends letters regularly to his dear aunt Lucy (Staunton) who will be turning 100 in the next few weeks. As a result, Paddington pursuits a rare pop-up book he'd like to send as a gift. Unbeknownst to him, the book holds the key to a hidden treasure which has been hunted for ages by the nefarious Phoenix Buchanan (Grant), former star of the stage and screen.Those who delighted in the warmth and wit of the original Paddington will find just as much to enjoy in this playful continuation. Paddington 2 takes full advantage as a sequel by immediately feeling more lived-in and comforting to those in the know, while still remaining as welcoming as ever to outsiders who are just now hopping on the bear's bandwagon. More impressively, it also retains the same emotional intelligence, thematic clarity and childlike wonder in such a way that it feels almost dirty to call something like this a ""sequel"" to a ""franchise"".It'd be more appropriate to simply say that Paddington 2 is a joy to watch, with the only obvious negative being that it remains unassuming and modest when it should be shouting its ability to engage from the rooftops. There is an able effort to shake the material from humility in the form of Hugh Grant who positively oozes charisma and is a gas to see chewing the scenery. The film lightly lampoon's Grant's off-screen persona by having the villain vamp against mannequins, sporting costumes of roles long past. It's a fun role but the ensemble isn't as all in as he is. This is not to say Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Jim Broadbent and Brendan Gleeson aren't good, they're just left in the dust a lot of the time.
 
There's also a few deus ex machina moments that lit up my pessimistic adult brain, but in a movie that has a full on jailhouse musical number, I'm willing to forgive the wayward assumption that good things can actually happen to good people (and bears). All in all, Paddington 2 is a charming affair - one which takes the daintily assembled world of the first and builds on it with heedless aplomb. In many ways it's a comfort for these increasingly cynical times. It serves as stark reminder that while adversity always abounds, a little bit of gumption and politeness can make this world just that much more pleasant.",Paddington 2
56,intelearts,602nd review: A Superb Children's Movie,9,12 November 2017,"Paddington 2 really is a fine children's movie. In fact, I would go as far as to say one of the best children's movies I have seen. It is not just charm and whimsy and genuine laughs though it has those in buckets - it is a real plot, and a solid caper movie to boot. By building on an ingenious crime element and real plotting it has turned from a sentimental journey to something more. As an avid reader of the books as a child, the main worry is the spirit of the bear who believes in the good in everyone, while creating untold chaos around him, will get lost to serve the storyline or some idea of updating Paddington. Luckily, none of the spirit is lost, and instead, we have an immensely enjoyable, fun, funny, and charming film. The whole family loved it - and we all laughed, cried, and cheered. Just be sure to stay seated for the credits. A really excellent children's film.",Paddington 2

58,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,As heart-warming as the original film. Paddington 2 is a rare family-friendly sequel that works.,10,27 August 2018,"Paddington's first cinematic outing in 2014 was immeasurably charming and lovable, but who'd have thought that the sequel could do exactly that again and this time in a debate-ably stronger way? Well Paddington 2 achieved what the first film did and then some; it's a sequel that can still be enjoyed, loved and understood independently of the original movie. Instead of Nicole Kidman this time it's Hugh Grant playing the baddie: and he's an even funnier character than Kidman's already good villainess was in the original movie. Honestly, this film is surprising with how much story and world-building it explores; it shows that these films have more layers than your average DreamWorks Animation sequels tend to have.Paddington 2 is lovable cinema done right: it's not overtly preachy in its innocence, it's got just the right balance of emotional and visual charm to hold adults and kids alike and it's got unique emotional value to other family movies out there. Paddington has made himself a more-then-welcome staple of family cinema for all to enjoy.This film is easily worth a watch; it's feel-good filmmaking that can make any type of film-goer ridiculously happy. Don't miss out on it. Paddington 2 gets 5/5 stars.",Paddington 2
59,Troy_Campbell,An enchanting sequel.,8,22 December 2017,"After 2015's Paddington was a surprise critical and commercial hit, it was only a matter of time for this sequel to be released. Two years is a mighty quick turnaround, but for director Paul King and his cast and crew, it was all they needed to deliver another delightful adventure. Having found himself a home in London with the Brown family, our furry little protagonist (again voiced by Ben Whishaw with bucket loads of charm) is now job-hunting in order to earn enough money to buy an antique pop-up book for his dear Aunt Lucy. Hijinks ensue, of course, and Paddington goes through a whirlwind journey of cleaning windows, going to prison, eating lots of marmalade, shaving off a judge's hair and learning many life lessons along the way. Much like its predecessor, this follow-up cares little for solid plotting or meaty character arcs, instead focussing on cute and clever set pieces and its central heartfelt message of being nice to one another. There's an admirable simplicity to it that allows the sweetness to just wash over you; the Wes Anderson-esque cinematography and production design is gorgeous, whilst the complete lack of irony in tone is endearingly wholesome. Fun for the whole family, Paddington 2 is an exciting and enchanting yarn that proudly wears its heart on its sleeve.",Paddington 2
60,areatw,"Just as good, if not better than its predecessor",8,19 August 2018,"As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the first 'Paddington' movie, this sequel was a must see for me. Not only does it not disappoint, as so many hyped movie sequels do, it exceeds all expectations and is arguably the better of the two films. 'Paddington 2' is another visual feast - the warm, vibrant animation is just phenomenal and a delight to watch, and the London setting is once again captured perfectly.In terms of the plot, I actually think 'Paddington 2' is even more enjoyable than its predecessor. It's full of ideas and creativity and contains so many laughs and memorable individual scenes. The cast is also brilliant, with the two Hughs (Grant & Bonneville) delivering particularly entertaining performances in their roles. And of course, Paddington is as charming as ever. This is another perfect family film and a sequel that, for once, lives up to all expectations.",Paddington 2
61,proud_luddite,Much more than what I expected,8,29 March 2018,"Paddington is a small-sized bear with human characteristics and lives with the Brown family in a pleasant London neighbourhood. After he is mistaken as a thief, the Brown family works tirelessly to catch the real thief.This sequel is way ahead of its 2014 predecessor in quality. Though it is occasionally marred in over-the-top slapstick, director Paul King gives a fun and cheeky attitude to much of its narrative's far-fetched elements. It's almost like he's giving the audience a wink when it jumps into the ""unbelievable"" territory. King also gives the film a quick and clever pace in scenes where the camera circles from the centre of a room while time passes quickly with activity taking much more time than the scene shows. (I'm sure there's a special film term for that. I admit my ignorance in not knowing it.)As the centre of the film, Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw) is a perfect contradiction for today's world: someone who still believes in goodness and kindness whether or not this attitude attracts trouble or loyalty. He is ultimately sweet and loveable in his naive purity. And the sentiment of this film is never manipulative or sugar-coated. Its fun, adventurous and humourous story leads to a genuinely emotional conclusion that brings out the tears.The closing credits provide an entertaining ""whatever happened to them"" conclusion highlighted by a hilarious sequence in a prison. Intentionally or not, ""Paddington 2"" gives brief tributes to classics of half a century ago: ""Oliver"" (a scene involving a food complaint) and ""The Producers"" (the aforementioned closing scene in a prison).""Paddington 2"" has much in common with the recently released ""Coco"". Both appeal to ""kids of all ages"" with the perfect blend of mind and heart. Is this a part of a new trend? Let's hope so.",Paddington 2
62,ProjectAnomaly,Paddington 2,2,2 October 2019,"This was a miserably amateur attempt at a sequel. Seriously, all this crap for a buried treasure? Formulaic much?",Paddington 2
63,RforFilm,"A rare sequel that's better then the original, Paddington 2 is a sweet reminder why we need those who see the good in everyone",10,19 January 2018,"A couple of years ago, the world got an adaptation of the Paddington stories. Unlike a lot of other children stories adaptations, it was clear that the bear's optimistic nature wasn't just going to translate to the character, but to the entire film. Oddly, seeing a movie with such a cheery nature was rare. In the age where the idea of good ""storytelling"" is to keep going dark, Paddington enforces the notion that there is a lot of good in the world that we seem to have a hard time finding. I too believe that the world would be a better place if we had more people that were just as supportive as Paddington. What I also liked about both the Paddington movie and stories is that they do acknowledge that there are bad people out there. They do understand that not everyone is going to give in to a sunny attitude. They even show that Paddington himself questions his positive persona and whether it's the best way to respond to situations. It's a story that may not offer something big to think about, it just feels like a nice breath of fresh air that we don't see as often as we should. That's why I'm glad to see his further adventures in Paddington 2. Paddington (played by Ben Whishaw) seems to have everything he wants; his human family, a neighborhood full of friends, and most importantly, everyone's happiness. He now wants to get a special present for his Aunt Lucy's one-hundredth birthday. Given she's always wanted to come to London, he finds a pop up book that he thinks would finally show her the beauty of the city. The problem is when he tries to buy it from the antique shop, the owner Samuel (played by Jim Broadbent) tells him that it's rare and will cost a thousand pounds. Paddington takes this time to get a variety of jobs to raise the money. At the same time, he remains supportive of his family's goals; Henry (played by Hugh Bonneville) wants a promotion at his job, Mary (played by Sally Hawkins) is getting ready to swim the English Chanel, daughter Judy is running her school's newspaper, and son Jonathan is trying to become a musician. Things reach a breaking point when Paddington is accused of trying to steal the book and is sent to jail. While he tries to make the prison a better place, the family tries to catch the real thief, a struggling actor Phoenix Buchanan (played by Hugh Grant).Paddington 2 is proof that with proper care, a sweet character not only can pull off a sequel that's just as good, it might be even better then the original. The first Paddington is certainly a great movie, though it did embark on a lot of ""fish out of water"" tropes that you see in stories about people moving. Here, Paddington is faced with further challenges about whether he can help everyone. He also goes through more ""fish out of water"" elements in the prison, but they feel harder then before.The story is elevated thanks to two people. Ben Whishaw continues to take a character, that could have been a bland ray of sunshine, and gives him a sense of honesty that makes his optimism more genuine. I think it's the fact that you see him work hard to try and find what makes people think better for themselves. The other is Hugh Grant who is just fun as the over-the-top villain. He's hammy, but in a way that does manage several laughs. You can tell he's having fun making this guy arrogant.The story itself is also interesting. Paddington's original goal was simply to get a present, but he's also forced to confront just how mean the world can be. He finds most of his answers in the prison he's sent to. And I do like just how far his human family sets to get him out. Even the climax, which is a lot more action orientated then I would expect from a Paddington movie, get in a thrilling train chase. This is the kind of story that children and their parents will like.I'll give this ten Paddington hats out of ten. It relieve me to know that there are storytellers out there that want to show that there are good people out there and are fully aware that they too have their struggles. Paddington is a character that we all need to have to show how much care can provide. Go see this and get a smile. Maybe a pop up book as well.",Paddington 2
64,bankofmarquis,"A wonderful, whimsical film for kids and adults alike",8,3 February 2019,"As I was perusing various ""Top Films of 2018"" lists, one surprising film kept showing up on these lists, so I thought I'd better check it out.And I'm glad I did for PADDINGTON 2 is a charming family film that entranced me from beginning to end with wonderful performances and a charm and whimsy that hooked me from start to finish.A follow-up to the moderate 2014 hit (based on the beloved children's books series) about a Peruvian bear that heads to 19th Century London seeking adventure - and finds a family - PADDINGTON 2 follows said Bear as he is caught up in a robbery and is mistakenly jailed for the crime. Can Paddington make friends with the burly inmates in the prison? Can the Brown family help find the true perpetrator of the crime and help spring Paddington? Can faith and love triumph in a time of skepticism and darkness?It's a family film, what do you think?The joy in this film is in the telling - and Paul King (returning as Director/Writer) does a wonderful job telling a joyous, family-friendly story without diving into sacrine-ness (is that a word? It is now) and schmaltz. He tells the story with a sly wink in his eye and dives deep into whimsical detail of late 19th century London - a London racing full throttle into the steam age. There is a light cyber-punk sensibility to the proceedings and this works wonderfully well.As you would expect, King does a nice job getting the actors to click into the sensibilities and style of this film. Ben Wishaw is back as the voice of Paddington - and he is perfectly cast. Wishaw has a naivete and sense of wonder to his voice that serves the Paddington character well. Jim Broadbent, Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins and Julie Walters all reprise their roles - in winning fashion. But it is the newcomers that shine. Brendan Gleeson shows off some comic chops as main prison bad guy ""Knuckles"" McGinty who forms an unlikely friendship/partnership with Paddington and, especially Hugh Grant as vain, egotistical actor Phoenix Buchanan. I won't spoil the antics of Grant's character but I have a feeling that Mr. Grant had as much fun bringing this character to screen as I did watching him.Two final things - the finale really works for me as King sets up each character's ""special skill"" at the beginning of the film that they will need to bring to bear (no pun intended) during the action at the end. To often, character's and character threads are set up at the beginning of a film only to be abandoned by the end, so it is satisfying to me when King sets up items at the beginning of this film and then PAYS THEM OFF at the end.And, finally, STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS. There is a scene in the credits that is as good as anything that is in the film.

65,Anurag-Shetty,Just plain old wholesome entertainment for all ages.,10,14 January 2018,"Paddington 2 continues with the adventures of Paddington(Ben Whishaw), the bear from Peru. Paddington is happily living with the Brown family. Everyone in his neighborhood, loves him too. For his Aunt Lucy's(Imelda Staunton) 100th birthday, Paddington wants to buy her the perfect gift. He works a number of petty jobs, in order to pay for the gift. However, the gift gets robbed. Now, it is up to Paddington to somehow find the stolen gift. Paddington 2 is an amazing film. Director Paul King has improved upon the 2014 original. Paddington 2 increases the heart, humor & adventure that made Paddington(2014), such a success. The animation is flawless. Paddington the bear, looks as lifelike as bears can look. The climactic set piece, is the highlight of the movie. The performances are another strong-point of the film. Hugh Bonneville is fantastic as Henry Brown. Sally Hawkins is spectacular as Mary Brown. Brendan Gleeson is brilliant as Knuckles McGinty. Julie Walters is great as Mrs. Bird. Jim Broadbent is superb as Mr. Gruber. Peter Capaldi is good as Mr. Curry. Hugh Grant is outstanding as Phoenix Buchanan. Madeleine Harris & Samuel Joslin are impressive as Judy Brown & Jonathan Brown, respectively. Last but not the least, Ben Whishaw is the star of the show as the voice of Paddington. The supporting cast is effective. Paddington 2 is a must watch for fans of Paddington(2014). Can't wait for Paddington 3!",Paddington 2
66,dave-mcclain,"not quite as good as the original, but still a lot of fun and pretty adorable (both Sally Hawkins and the titular bear)",7,28 January 2018,"""Paddington 2"" (PG, 1:43) is the 2017 sequel to the live action - CGI hybrid from 2014 (both films being released in the U.S. in the January following their London premiers the previous November). This second film finds the small, friendly, innocent and clumsy bear from ""deepest, darkest Peru"" happily ensconced with the Browns, his adopted London family... VERY happily, except that he still misses his elderly aunt who's living in a retirement community back in Peru. Paddington wants to buy his aunt a very special present for her 100th birthday, but it's a rare and expensive item so he takes on a series of jobs (at which he has varying degrees of success) in order to save up enough money to buy the gift. But before he reaches his goal, the item is stolen by someone who values it for very different reasons. Paddington ends up getting blamed for the theft, arrested and jailed. While the Browns work to free him (and catch the real crook), our favorite marmalade-loving bear has to figure out how to survive prison and do what he can to prove his innocence. Both Paddington and the Browns end up resorting to extreme measures to accomplish their mutual goals in this fun, amusing and even exciting family-friendly film. Paul King is again co-writer and director, while Ben Whishaw again voices Paddington. Hugh Grant earned a BAFTA nomination for his role as a local has-been actor of dubious character and the Browns are again played by Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeline Harris and Samuel Joslin - with Hawkins' performance reminding us how talented (and adorable) she is - and how great she was in ""The Shape of Water"". All this gives us a movie which isn't quite as good as the original, but still well worth a look. ""B+""",Paddington 2
67,markthomassintek,Again the curse of the sequel has reared it's ugly head to make this a flat film compared to the original and even the original BBC TV series.,6,26 March 2018,"REVIEW - PADDINGTON 2When I was a kid I'll admit I watched Paddington on the BBC which was then animated using hand drawn cut outs for scenery and other characters, the only one being in colour was Paddington Bear. For me the innocence of the program was the main attraction. This film was heaped with praise and white I can appreciate it for some parts of this film I unfortunately can't in others. The CGI bear is just wonderful, facial features and even fur moving in a realistic way but.....Many kids films these days have a level of dual humour, one the kids understand and one adults do, as with pantomimes, but this film doesn't even try to keep the adults entertained.Simple story which promotes family values, understanding, tolerance and acceptance which is a good thing but just loses its way somewhat. Hugh Grant received lots of praise for his role in this and honestly to me he just seemed, well I've seen him perform better and what happened to Julie Walters? She hardly had any lines and when she did speak it was only a one line here or there which was a shame because in the first film she was excellent. Again the curse of the sequel has reared it's ugly head to make this a flat film compared to the original and even the original BBC TV series. Rating 6 out of 10",Paddington 2
68,jrarichards,Plenty of delights for adults too,8,18 July 2018,"From the outset, this second Paddington outing from Paul King had to resemble its predecessor in offering something for those who read Michael Bond's books as they were coming out - or soon after, and that means from the late 1950s onwards; as well as for kids who might well believe the beloved character is confined to screens large and small. One immediately visible, mystical and quite fantastic way in which this is achieved is through sets and scenes that are surprisingly timeless. While Mr Brown (again played by Hugh Bonneville) works in an office in The Shard (completed 2012), Paddington's more regular haunts in Notting Hill (well, where else could it be really?) and the Portobello Road regularly give the impression of being ""some years ago"", and in this way play surprisingly faithful homage to Peggy Fortnum's illustrations in the books, which are somewhat impressionistic, but definitely ""from back then"". This is artistic stuff of a high order, and - as always in the past - London is magically capable of achieving this mix of eras, just as it mixes everything else you can think of; and the film makes no secret of its adoration for the great capital city. In line with that, the piece is avowedly pro-immigration, doing everything in its power to convince us that London-ness and Britishness are strong enough to encompass and welcome and gently tweak habits from every other conceivable country and culture without its own magic being diluted or lost in the process. It's a quite persuasive and beautiful case, even if the most powerful scene here (for adults at least) is a ""pop-up book come to life"" that wondrously and movingly takes us back to an earlier, still obviously cosmopolitan but slightly less multi-culti version of the city. The effect is quite spellbinding.Obviously, Paddington's capacity to get into scrapes that are nothing too serious, but nevertheless convey a hint of menace (often helped along by ""Mr Curry"" - as here played by Peter Capaldi) and chaos and momentary ""lost-ness"" are drawn out from the original books in a fine way here, and are mostly funny; though there is perhaps slightly less to laugh at here (in an unforced way) than in ""Paddington 1"".The barber's shop scene nevertheless stands out for its joyous inventiveness, as does Paddington busy cleaning windows...A more serious (potential) problem for adult viewers will be the tendency for certain actors here to move in the direction of cliche. This is doubtless a necessary step to keep younger viewers on board, but while some see the Hugh Grant villain role here as ""the actor sending himself up""; for me this hardly works. Brendan Gleeson as a prisoner (dressed a la 1930s???) also seems like pastiche, as does Tom Conti as a senior judge. For me at least more joy is to be had with Jim Broadbent reprising his role as Mr Gruber - whose memories presumably (now magically-incongrously) extend back to Wartime Central Europe, and allow the actor to give a wonderful performance in which tragedy is somehow tangible beneath a warm and kindly surface - this is clever stuff indeed given how few lines the actor actually gets. Julie Walters as Mrs Bird says even less - and sadly represents a wasted opportunity, while Sally Hawkins is likewise underused (though sometimes fun) as Mrs Brown. Punching above his weight, in contrast, is Sanjeev Bhaskar in his classy and in fact meaningful role as Dr Jafri.No film for all the family is going to succeed without making some compromises, but there is not doubt at all that ""Paddington 2"" does what it takes to woo adults with both its contemporary style and ability to provoke nostalgia. However, this owes more to the animated star of the show, and to magnificent scene-setting, than it does to acting ... or in fact storytelling.But that's alright!",Paddington 2
69,kjproulx,Heartwarming and Charming,8,9 March 2018,"I'm a sucker when it comes to feel-good movies, so please take this review with a grain of salt if those types of films are cheesy to you. When the first Paddington hit theatres a few years ago, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the filmmakers crafted a wonderful family flick for all ages. Yes, the premise is aimed at kids to give them life lessons, but the family aspect is what everyone else could relate to. Paddington 2 has recently hit the big screen and I can confidently say that if you enjoyed watching the first film, then you will equally like this sequel. It's a simple story about friends and family, but it's done in a very loving way that's almost too charming to ignore when you start watching it. Here's why you'll watching Paddington 2 with a smile on your face throughout the entire film if this is your cup of tea.Paddington 2 follows this lovable bear as he has now settled into this town with the Brown family. The public has now accepted this talking bear as one of their own, and he's doing his utmost to get a job and become a true citizen. When trying to stop a jewel thief, he becomes wrapped up in an accusation that eventually has him thrown in prison. Wanting to put an end to this thief and make thing right in terms of showing everyone the truth, Paddington 2 is a showcase of a wrongfully accused being, which is quite relevant for today's climate. The fact that such a large aspect of this film revolves around someone being wrongfully accused is astounding to me, especially when it's a film for kids, first and foremost.Although there's nothing award-worthy about the screenplays for these films, that's not to say they aren't well-written in their own right. For a kids movie, Paddington 2 delivers many surprises in terms of emotion and I found myself in tears in the final few moments. Not only is this movie emotional, but it also delivers quite the exciting final act that almost feels like a chase sequence from a big action film, just on a lower scale. With that said, emotions and excitement aren't the only things putting this movie on the pedestal it deserves, because the characterization of every secondary character shines off the screen as well.Whether this little bear finds himself interacting with inmates at the prison he's being held at or simply conversing with his family when they come to visit, there's just something about the dialogue between characters that feels very authentic. The head chef's relationship with the titular character was easily my favourite portion of this film because he comes off as someone who would kill someone if he was in an R-rated movie, but when placed side-by-side with a younger person, his actions may be slightly different. I loved this aspect of the movie.In the end, everything about the story in Paddington 2 is borrowed from crime films and family films alike. There isn't much else going on here, so your characters and overall execution of the story need to be absolutely perfect in order to impress, and does it ever. There will be far better movies to hit theatres this year, but if you're looking for a movie to make you feel good inside, I honestly can't recommend Paddington 2 enough. There's something about these two films and the way that director Paul King assembles them that just feels necessary to watch. It's a shame these movies don't receive much attention because they truly are great family flicks.",Paddington 2
70,davyd-02237,lots of fun!,8,29 December 2019,"And should be taken as a fun film for all the family, take it too seriously and you wont enjoy it - see the Train chase towards the end as an example. this is sheer fun, brilliant from Hugh Grant, another solid performance from Brendan Gleeson and brilliant casting all around from everyone that is featured. we were left in our home (a middle aged couple) hoping for a third very soon as such a difference from the usual ""blood and guts"" type of thing over Christmas...loved it",Paddington 2
71,brankovranjkovic,Paddington 2: Could a sequel be better than the original? This one is!,9,14 November 2017,"This is a CGI animated film sequel of the charming bear character called Paddington, the bear who always looks for the good in people. In this film we see that one year on from the original film Paddington has really become part of the Brown family and very much part of the local community. Paddington is looking for the perfect present for his Auntie Lucy's 100th birthday, he sees a pop-up book in an antique shop, but it's very expensive (£500). None-the-less, he decides to buy it as his Auntie only ever wanted to see London, so this seems perfect. Paddington needs to do a string of different odd jobs to earn the necessary money to buy the book, all with disastrous slap-stick comedy consequences. The book also provides clues to the location of some treasure. Late one night Paddington witnesses the book being stolen from the shop, he chases the villain but he escapes. The police arrive on the scene and have no alternative but to convict Paddington, the Brown family need to clear Paddington's name and find the thief. Whilst in prison, which is colourful and largely resembles The Grand Budapest Hotel, Paddington makes friends with several of the eccentric inmates, his exchanges with them are all hilarious including some use of the famous 'hard stare'. Paddington manages to break out with three other inmates, they (and the Browns) are now in pursuit of the book thief. Of course they catch the devious thief, and recover the book. Go see this gem of a film, generally better than the original with a who's who cast of British acting royalty, and an emotional ending. Stay for the closing credits for a comedy dance sequence. Very highly recommended.",Paddington 2
72,anselmdaniel,A fun adventure,7,3 July 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Paddington 2 is the sequel to the original Paddington and stars the same case with a new villain.The movie follows Paddington as he tries to earn enough money to buy his aunt a present. Along the way, Paddington is framed for a crime he does not commit and is incarcerated. The Brown family sets out to clear Paddington's name and Paddington sets out to find the person responsible.Paddington 2 utilizes similar aspects from the first installment to its benefit. Like the first movie, the characters have their own motivations, weaknesses, and traits that make them stand out. For one, Paddington still loves marmalade and this leads to more funny scenes with it. The Brown family have their own quirks and they have developed since the end of the first movie. The new characters introduced are a group of prisoners that Paddington encounters and the villainous actor.The villain in Paddington 2 is a treat to watch whenever he is on the screen. Even though his goal is simple, the directing, writing, and dialogue elevate him into a highly engaging and entertaining villain. Many of his heist scenes are incredibly well shot and edited. I am hard-pressed to remember any poor scenes he was in.All of the scenes in this movie flow incredibly well. There is not a weak component to this movie. Although some may prefer the first movie's simplicity, the second movie offers a lot to like as the world is expanded.I highly recommend Paddington 2.

75,Imdbidia,Great second part,9,7 November 2018,"I was dreading this second movie as, in my experience, second parts aren't usually good. Yet, Paddington 2 is a great film on its own and a great follow up to the story. Honestly, I enjoyed this film more than the first one.Paddington 2 has charm, magic, action, adventure, drama, and a great sense of humor. It has heart, compassion, fun, action, and great message for children and adults, as it promotes kindness, hard work, not to give up when things go wrong, and to trust yourself and your instinct because they are usually a great compass for life. In a world full of verbal attack and vitriol, where the lack of respect and verbal abuse are becoming too common and acceptable, Paddington comes to remind us that it's good to be kind and respectful, even in your worst moments.All the cast does a terrific job in the film. However, Hugh Grant was the biggest nicest surprise to me, as he usually doesn't play this sort of hilarious character; Grant plays his character with flair and gusto, and some of his scenes in the film are among my fav, his conversations in the attic and the scene inserted in the end credits especially.A very enjoyable film for both children and adults. Old stories never die, they become stronger, like Paddington.",Paddington 2
76,Alexander_Blanchett,Incredibly charming family entertainment,7,15 April 2018,"Cute family entertainment and just as charming as the first part. It is film that is definitely aimed to the younger audience however works for grown ups as well because of many ironic moments. 
The film is from the beginning to the end very entertaining and never lacks entertainment. The acting was fine with Hugh Grant being the absolute standout as the villain. A perfect role for the British actor which gave him a lot of potential to make fun of his own image as an actor. He really needs to play more roles like that in the future. Also Brendan Gleeson really stole every scene he was in and it was such a big pleasure seeing him on screen in a role like that. Hugh Bonneville was fun and had some great comedic timing. Sally Hawkins also was more memorable than in the first one. Its always a pleasure to see Julie Walters. 
The animation was cute enough and the whole look of the film extremely effective - like from a kids comic strip. Very delightful. Nice soundtrack and a very well crafted screenplay which was probably the secret of the film's quality. I really would not mind to see another installment and adventure of that clumsy bear.",Paddington 2
77,cardsrock,Simply wonderful,9,22 May 2019,"I don't think the word charming can do this film justice. It's just so infectiously sweet and sincere. Paddington is as endearing as he was in the first film, but he enjoys even more amusing hijinks this time around. Every scene at the prison is terrific and Hugh Grant is perfectly suited as the eccentric villain. I can't overstate just how much heart this movie has and you'll be hard-pressed not to get emotional at its touching ending.",Paddington 2
78,Jithindurden,Sweet,6,14 March 2018,"As good as the first one but I think the acclaim as better than the original comes from political reasons Brexit and Trump. Visually it's like a Wes Anderson film which was also said about the original but with more life in them.

79,cliftonofun,My 13 year old said this movie was unrealistic,7,26 May 2020,"I really thought this film franchise would suffer from diminishing returns. I mean, how could a story that relied so much on enchanting tone and whimsical details work again and again? Well, if anything this movie ratcheted up the enchantment and whimsy. And did so while incorporating prison? It was an impressive (and delightful) feat. That said, my 13 year old son was rather frustrated with the gaping and implausible plot holes about 2/3 of the way through. That was when I paused and reminded him we were watching a movie about the adventures of a talking bear who likes marmalade. So sure: you should suspend disbelief. Then just enjoy the ride.",Paddington 2

Unfortunately, a devious has-been actor decides he wants the book as well and frames Paddington with stealing it from the antique shop.Vibrant, lovely, beautiful and fun...this movie doesn't stop with the cuteness and precious sweetness. The family is clearly more modernized now as they've grown up, as has the town. It is also a side story of intolerance which...didn't need to be said, but it still is a nice message.
It's odd that there are some here who've not enjoyed it. They do everything short of a musical number to make you happy...oh wait...they throw that in too! A joyous light-hearted universe for all ages, though I think adults may actually enjoy it more than children. Excellent!",Paddington 2

Paddington 2 doesn't just stay in the comfortable realm of the Brown family - it introduces new, real struggles for Paddington in prison and his personal struggle with isolation. There is a broader cast of characters, and you feel that you see more depth and realism in the characters than the first. There is still the sense that everything works out overly conveniently for Paddington and that he always manages to have an unusually large impact. His massive revamping of the prison life was a bit over the top, and his interaction with Nuckles was an example of things just happening perfectly so Paddington gets off easily. Lots of convenient, perfect timings, like the airplane being at the perfect spot with just seconds to spare, and each person's skills being used perfectly, like the swimming, train driving, and baseball throwing. However, none of that really takes away from the absolutely heart warming message throughout the movie. We see Paddington's impact on the community clearly, and his ending with Aunt Lucy was truly beautiful. The visuals were very impressive, especially the use of the pop up book in scenes, and the way the film was made was a carefree, loving happiness for all that Paddington Brown exudes. It has its flaws, but there is more thematic and character depth here, a less simple and bland plot, and a grander emotional payoff in the ending.

92,Figgy66-915-598470,Great family entertainment,10,20 November 2017,"20 November 2017 Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Paddington 2. Three years after the amazing original movie Paddington bursts back onto our screen. Full of good intentions, his naivety lands him in hot water and he finds himself locked up with everyone trying to clear his name. All our old favourites are back, Hugh Bonneville as Mr Brown, Julie Walters as Mrs Bird and Peter Capaldi as Mr Curry among others, however I think the real human star of the show was Hugh Grant, who played the dastardly Phoenix Buchanan with aplomb. Phoenix is a washed up actor reduced to doing dog food commercials who takes advantage of Paddington and makes you want to yell Boo Hiss from the audience. There is some brilliant acting from everyone who is interacting with Paddington, you wouldn't know there wasn't a real talking bear there. A great film for all the family to enjoy, oh and stay sat down for the credits on this one!!!",Paddington 2
93,kermitkid,A delightful trip to the cinema,8,31 March 2020,"2018 is off to a great start. This movie was great! I wouldn't say it's better than the first one, but I still enjoyed it. The acting was great. Brendan Gleeson as a prison chef is particularly delightful. The CGI is some of the best I've seen. The plot jumped around at points, and made it hard to keep track of what was going on, but the payoff in the end was satisfying. At first, I thought this would be just a cute kids' film, nothing more, but there was actually some substance to it. Even a lot of the adults in my screening were laughing, and laughing hard. The slapstick humor was a bit over the top at points and slowed the film down as filler, and was unneeded, but when it did shift focus back to the story, it was good. I enjoyed Hugh Grant's performance as the villain. He wasn't as good as Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the villain, (she was far more evil and her intents were actually sinister. Grant's character is a bit sillier.) but he was still enjoyable. (There was one scene in particular during the end credits that had me laughing pretty hard.) Considering this is 1. a sequel and 2. a sequel to a kids film, this had more effort put into it then there needed to be. It deserves its (surprising) 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It's a delightful film, and a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.

95,FelipeCarrillo,"ossibly the best movie sequel of a family live-action pic in a long, long time.",9,15 April 2018,"First of all, the new installment inserts, in my opinion, a female predominance that is a little synthetic, forced and purposeful to the issues of today's women and men equality. In the opening scene, it's not papa bear who executes dangerous feats, it's Aunt Lucy, who proves to have enough guts, up to there a generous honor, however, all female sub-plots in the Brown family become erroneously comic: swimming an entire ocean or writing a men-free newspaper? Really? Fortunately, the excessive female empowerment ceases from there, and perhaps it'd have worked better if this cool load had been distributed throughout the film, the saturation of the onset didn't help at all. Moreover, the script is not exempt from showing stereotyped and traditional versions and failed comedy moments, but, they're, luckily, limited, opening the way to the eccentricities that enable it to be a family film, probably, belonging to the best of the best of the new century.As most of the supporting plots lack a solid and credible identity, writers Simon Farnaby and Paul King opt to deposit all their narrative inventiveness in the protagonist's central plot, since, in the end, it's he who must be under the spotlight, of course, an action made possible by a three-dimensional antagonist. Hugh Grant stands in for the main role in the scenes where the bear is missing, because this villain, a funny character and peculiar enough not to surpass the barrier of the absurd, makes possible the gratifying amount of comedy situations and justifies, eloquently, the progress of the story and its corresponding junctures. The acting power not only lies on the antagonist's shoulders, we also receive charming and juicy interpretations from actors such as Peter Capaldi and Sally Hawkins, creating a dynamic pace and a fluid connection with the audience. It's important to dedicate a whole paragraph to the unexpected humor of the feature film because supported by elements previously mentioned such as cast or artistic inventiveness, it manages to be one of the best shaped, most virtuous and functional comedies of recent times. It's known that within the feasible ""Paddington"" movie franchise, the comic factor rests mostly upon the shoulders of the dewy-eyed bear, because of this we see how, amusingly, different jobs pop up through the life of the animal. With all the different variables and combinations for comedy genre, the film chooses to put one more physical and boisterous in scenes where the nice protagonist is usually the architect, in the same way, it's evident a dynamic and sincere collective charm that always derives from the interaction between the characters and the leading role. Likewise, the screenwriters are perceptive enough to interweave every funny moment with subsequent situations, in other words, the characters or actions, they perform without intent, are generally part of a humorous range bigger than the achieved with a single scene, a better result. On this occasion, the vivid colors, an innate feature of the first film, return, however, it differs, radically, because they don't end up being cloying, Erik Wilson knows how to endow a film focused on a defined-personality animal, clearly, supported by a source of inspiration, however, this doesn't devitalize the enchantment and strength of a world that makes speeches through the visual landscapes with aplomb about hope and union. A major achievement is the artistic section of the work, it's dazzling and laborious the way in which they avoid ridicule moves even having pink-dressed prisoners, a family with extravagant garments or a metropolis with serious wrapping but colorful content; every little feature is visually coherent as a whole, a polychromatic whole. It's a huge victory for family comedies. Added to the handsome cinematography, it seems incalculable the number of special effects responsible who took an active part in the film, however, based on their work on specific scenes, it's possible to give approximations with full conviction. No wonder, Paul King's ""Paddington 2"" returns to the top, materializing splendid visual wills and proposing important teachings, operations that allow it to be a compelling film for general audiences; A creative and deep-felt comedy that means a real event because it vindicates the poor quality of the most recent family flicks. As a motion picture, it borders on the critical perfection and commercially has become a moderate hit, however, the true victory of King's movie is to conceive one of the best cinematic adventures about love, family and, could not miss the peculiarities of a charismatic kind-hearted bear; creatively surprising and narratively dynamic, we welcome a feature film that is truly worth paying for, without noticing its smell of marmalade.",Paddington 2
96,daoldiges,Charming On All Accounts,9,24 December 2018,"I'd heard of Paddington the Bear but had never seen or read anything about him in my youth or as an adult, and hadn't seen the first Paddington movie. However, when two of my favorite film podcasters (Filmspotting) gave positive reviews to Paddington2 I decided to check it out and am I ever happy that I did. I was blown away by how surprisingly charming and delightful this film was! Everything about it seemed to work - the story, the animation, the acting, the pace, it was both humorous and touching.

A perfect film in all ways suitable for all the family for children 8 months to 80 years and beyond . A total delight . Cinema-photography was excellent, giving an interesting nostalgic feel set in modern times , at times you felt you were being transported back to your childhood in the 1950s - 1970s with many aspects such as steam trains and Victorian architecture and prisons - the Hugh Grant Phoenix Buchanan character was almost as if Terry Thomas had been reincarnated to play the role! Shots of Windsor gardens and the Shard juxtapositioned the tourist view of London old and new . The theme of good versus evil reigned supreme throughout . Together with love conquers all and community spirit . Michael Bond the author sadly died in Paddington on the last day of filming never reaching the age of Aunt Sally but at 91 he lived a long life and left us with a masterpiece . The cast was absolutely superb - the animation top notch - you'd forget that Paddington is a bear as did the characters at times - watch the credits right to the end for Hugh camping it up to the max . Superb - you'll love it Pad.A 10/10'",Paddington 2
99,WubsTheFadger,Paddington 2,8,9 May 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFor the second installment in the Paddington series, we get a sweet and genuine story with some very good laughs. The story is easy to follow and all the characters are very relatable. Paddington 2 is a great children's film.The acting is very good. Hugh Bonneville, Julie Walters, Sally Hawkins, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Noah Taylor, Brendan Gleeson and Madeleine Harris all perform very well. Ben Whishaw plays Paddington and he does a great job as usual. His voice for Paddington is so soft, caring, and genuine.The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is overlong.The CGI is usually very good. Paddington always looks great but some of the train scenes look fake.Pros: Sweet and genuine story, good humor, great acting, good characters amazing voice acting by Ben Whishaw, and good CGICons: Some slow pacing, the runtime is a little overlong, and some CGI looks fakeOverall Rating: 8.1",Paddington 2
100,n-kefala,Great movie,8,30 December 2017,"A good family adventure that's the right sort of heartwarming, delivering real human emotion through a small bear and it is Hugh Grant as the villain that steals the show, offering a funny performance. The movie not only does it keep the same characters and setting, but maintains the same level of heart and humor to become a truly unforgettable, lovely time at the theater. As with the hilarious and highly entertaining 2014 original, ""Paddington 2"" provides some of the best family entertainment you'll have at the cinema all year and the truth is that the most sequels feel inferior to the original but this is a rare case where that isn't true. Action and laughs are plenty, but it is the film's overall tenderness and charm that will keep you smiling throughout the 104 minutes.",Paddington 2
101,scythertitus,'Therefores' not 'And Thens',9,22 December 2017,"This film is a delight and somehow captures the magic of the original and continues in the same spirit, if not surpassing it. I defy anyone not to enjoy this family romp as not only is it suitable for anyone, but it also appeals to everyone.Sometimes it is only in snatches but everyone in the film gets a moment and there is a little bit of something for everyone in the audience as well. The story is great and there are fun moments and big laughs scattered throughout. Everything rests on the great storytelling however as it uses the time-tested formula of 'Therefores' instead of 'And thens'. Instead of a random assortment of scenes and occurrences vaguely stitched together in the end, everything follows a logic that sees one event lead to another and all come together to create a full and enjoyable picture.Overall this film comes highly recommended as whether you are young or old it is enjoyable and suitable for everyone while still being massively entertaining and fun, it joins the previous Paddington in becoming an instant classic, which is pretty rare for a sequel!",Paddington 2
102,AnishMisra,Paddington 2 review,9,18 January 2018,"Paddington 2 is a film co-written and directed by Paul King. I remember watching the first part back in 2014 and loving this film. And so, when I heard about a second film, I was very much excited. The trailers too looked great. And finally after waiting for a long time for the film and seeing it, I can say that I was rejoiced by this film.Plot: Paddington decides to gift Aunt Lucy a pop-up book about London. But before that, he gets arrested and is framed for stealing the book. Can he and the Brown's prove his innocence?Story and direction: Like the first part, the film respected the Paddington character and the world. This is what I liked about this film. Normally, the films that are in franchises do tend to repeat the same things that made the first film a success, thus having a dip in quality. But that is not the case with this venture. Paul KIng exactly knows his audience and treats it in the same way. The characters never feel diluted and the story is very engaging. It also never makes it too 'for kids'. It is a film that can be very well enjoyed by adults too. The VFX of Paddington's character once again stands out. Never was a moment I felt that it is a CGI-ed character that is being booked at. The film shows London in a way that I guess no other film has showed. But this film too has its issues. Somewhere along the film, do you feel the implausibilties of the situation. Being a person who watches a lot of films, that interrupted the fun a few times.Performances: Hugh Bonneville was great once again. Sally Hawkins was top-notch. Peter Calpadi was good too, although his role was lesser as compared to the first part. Brendan Gleeson was also good in the film and I want to see what this character has to offer us (If there is a 3rd film). Hugh Grant was also excellent as the film's villain. He provided a kind of ege to his charactyer. Finally, Ben Winshaw is great in his voice work.Favorite Scene: The scene where Mr. Gruber show Paddington the pop-up book and Paddington imagines about showing his London to Aunt Lucy. The innovative-ness of the scene is what impressed me about this particular scene.Verdict: This bear is lovable to watch. If there will be a third film, I hope it can match to the greatness the first two have gotten to. My preference would be this part than to the first because this film showed Paddington more than just a bear.I am going with a 9/10.",Paddington 2
103,Condemned-Soul,An exceptional family adventure comedy!,9,20 July 2018,"Paddington 2 is an impressive sequel that surpasses the first with dazzling skill. From beginning to end, this family adventure serves up enough humour to keep all ages entertained. 
A narrative that is simple yet satisfying is no common feat, and Paddington 2 achieves the unexpected of becoming one of last year's most enjoyable films. With a wide range of comedic talent, noteworthy cameos, and classic British humour, there's no shortage of chuckles and slapstick, all executed by a strong cast of recognisable faces. A sharp script makes valuable use of every scenario, emphasising the comedy in a well-paced story home to the dastardly scheme carried out by Hugh Grant's hilariously conniving villain; a performance that is sure to please fans and appeal to younger audiences. 
Overall Paddington 2 is a resounding success, a result of perfect comic timing from all involved on set, and the profound skill from all those working behind the scenes to produce a joyful adventure that more than qualifies the right to get another sequel. 
9/10!",Paddington 2

Even though I think the story is good I can't stop noticing some far-fetched scenes (even for an animated movie) and the cheesy dialogue at times. Overall, I really enjoyed and recommend it!",Paddington 2
108,trevorwomble,For once a sequel that doesn't disappoint,9,10 November 2017,"I was hugely surprised at just how good the first film was and was tentatively cautious when this sequel was green-lighted that perhaps it might cheapen Michael Bond's beloved family friendly creation.However, fear not, for this sequel is absolutely terrific on all levels. Firstly it is as funny and witty and as brilliantly animated as the first film. The excellent cast from the first film is also enhanced by a superb turn from Hugh Grant, who hasn't been as good as he is here in a long time. In fact it is quite clear to the viewer that Grant is thoroughly enjoying himself by playing against type and sending himself up as a faded egotistical actor and total cad who sets Paddington up to be the fall guy (or should that be Bear?) for a dastardly deed. There is a touch of the pantomime villain to his performance, but it works splendidly and it fits his character perfectly.All the wit and heart of the first film is still evident here and in some ways, built upon. Brendan Gleeson is also excellent as an old lag and prison cook who loses his angry nature when he succumbs to Paddington's charms and talents in the kitchen. There are also loads of great jokes too, some pitched at younger children and some deliberately aimed at the more adult viewer.All in all this is a worthy sequel and a great memorial to Paddingtons creator, Michael Bond, who died whilst this sequel was still being filmed. It is full of laughs, thrills, action sequences, great characters, some wonderful animation (one scene is an obvious nod to the 2D paper cut-outs of the human characters in the 1970s children's TV show) and you would have to have a hard heart indeed to not burst into tears at the wonderful ending. Also, don't leave the film until you watch Hugh Grant gloriously send himself up with a musical song and dance act as the end credits roll. Thoroughly recommended to anybody who wants to see 100 minutes of family friendly fun that isn't either sickly sweet or too dark for youngsters and still thoroughly watchable to adults too. Great fun and a worthy sequel to one of the best British films in recent years.",Paddington 2

110,Brevin_Campbell,A really fun film but has some messy story points,9,22 January 2018,"I really did enjoy this movie. Much like the first film it still has the wit and charm to it that makes it really fun to watch. It is very innocent and cute too. All the cast members give it there all in making this film come together and helping to create a more satisfying experience. But this film has a major fault in its plot. There are things in it that don't make a lot of sense especially when the investigation comes together it is very messy and doesn't make a once of sense. I understand that this is a film about a talking bear so there is some suspension of disbelief that needs to be had, but when your plot is being focused on that part of the film needs to make some sense. Now this doesn't change my love for the film at all. I just really wanted to give this movie a 10 and have found cause of this one mistake it made I really can not now. Still though the film has a very funny and entertaining villain that was very eccentric that I liked. And some of the prisoners were very good too. Overall the Paddington sequel is a very great add on to the franchise.",Paddington 2

I think what makes this movie so accessible to both young and old is the simplicity of the story. Paddington may not have had a fancy background, but his aunt installed the most important values of seeing the best in people and treating them well. He is thrown into a typical situation that anyone might encounter and he navigates this difficult web by applying his principles.

118,2001ASOfan,All of the film's highlights are in the trailer,2,23 January 2018,"Just as a warning and to give you a sense of how much ""Paddington 2"" was ruined by my involuntarily seeing the trailer multiple times prior to its opening (I go to the movies in theaters a lot), all of its major plot points and surprises are in the trailer--there are no additional joke punchlines, plot twists, or revelations at all. The trailer is one big, long, Spoiler. But my 2 out of 10 star rating and reaction to seeing the film is also as much about what a wisp of a movie it is even if it's been ruined by seeing the trailer--and don't start assuming I hate sweet films that are meant to be inoffensive and loveable: Just the opposite--I'm often overcome with emotion in G or PG-rated films that are a stark and daring contrast to all the snark and violence in many mainstream films. But ""Paddington 2"" all but fluffs up, softly twinkles, and disappears while you're watching it. It feels like there's nothing there. Even a bright, primary-colored onscreen carnival and its rides have been scrubbed and painted to a glossy sheen, and it struck me as so odd that no one is seen actually riding and enjoying them in the background. The whole film feels just as sterile and lifeless as that carnival. One critic lovingly compared this film to a roll of Charmin toilet tissue--and I'm assuming he or she meant soft, fluffy, and comforting. But, for me, it was so sweetly bland it lost me early on, and never regained my interest--and there was that nagging, recurring realization that I'd seen all of its best moments in the trailer. I'm happy for those who love this film, and Paddington the bear and the books that feature him--it is undeniably well-intentioned to be a comforting, inoffensive family film (and character), but somehow it left me bored, cold, depressed, and very, very disappointed.",Paddington 2
119,jmmustchin,SO DAMN GOOD!!!,10,8 October 2018,"My apologies for swearing (and shouting) in the title, but the movie IS just so delightful! It's a sequel to Paddington, but in my opinion, it outdoes the original!Paddington's aunt Lucy (who is revealed to not be his biological aunt, but took him in as an orphan) is approaching her 100th birthday. Paddington wants to get her a birthday present, and settles on an old pop-up book of London. He tries to get work in order to pay for it, and settles on window cleaning. However, a mysterious thief steals the book, and Paddington is blamed. He winds up in prison. The Browns work hard to try to uncover the thief.Pretty early on in the film - right after the robbery, in fact - it is revealed that the thief is none other than Phoenix Buchanan (Hugh Grant), a famous actor who's moved into the neighbourhood. For the rest of the movie, Paddington makes the best of prison and improves it, Phoenix is searching for clues to a treasure, and the Browns are trying to figure out who the thief is - and how to expose him and clear Paddington.This film lived up to the laugh-out-loud humour of the original movie, and is lighter. Like the first, it's an unrealistic and nonsensical family comedy that is simply ridiculously delightful to watch.",Paddington 2
120,jandriod2012,Absolutely delightful,10,18 March 2018,"I loved the first Paddington film and am very pleased to say that this was equally enchanting. Anyone who has read the books or remembers the TV animated series will not be disappointed, the film holds true to the story and I was very pleased to see the Paddington 'hard stare' first hand, which I have practiced for many years. Visually pleasing and quite magical in parts, there are unforgettable scenes throughout. While the star of the show is undoubtedly Paddington himself, hats off go to Hugh Grant who embraced his role and has completely gone up dramatically in my estimation, not least for the final credits. I laughed and cried from start to finish, this is a joyful and beautiful film that will warm the cockles of your heart - and if it doesn't then you need serious help! A lovely, lovely film.",Paddington 2
121,mirkobozic,Better stock up on marmalade.,10,3 March 2021,"There are quite a few feelgood movies that are of essence when dealing with depressing experiences like the currenct epidemic. And that's a pool of joy one should be compelled to tap into every now and then. That's exactly what Paul King delivers with Paddington 2, a handful of new adventures involving everyone's favourite talking toy. Here, it's all about him trying to get his hands on an antique book he wants to give his aunt Lucy for her 100th birthday. In order to buy it, he gets several jobs which are rather a sequence of hilarious mishaps. Unexpectedly, he runs into the actor Phoenix Buchanan who turns out to be a major obstacle on the way to the cherished present.
The Browns are a loveable bunch as always, and they have a clearer set their own of subplots this time: the kids are trying to fit in new environments at the cost of their own true identities, their parents are struggling with crises of their own. Paddington is the element that ties together all of these, with King giving even the likeable neighbors their own background stories. Movies like these always have a moral lesson to them, which one might explain away by the fact that the main character originates from a tv program essentially meant for children. However, the true success of ""Paddington 2"" lies in the fact that it succeeds to impress and involve even the grown-ups. You'd need to have a heart of stone to go through it untouched by the main character's disarming insistence on optimism. The movie does for marmalade the very same thing like Lasse Halstrom's film for chocolate. It makes you crave. And that can't be a bad thing. Right now, all we do is crave anyway, so we might as well for something that's heart-warming instead of depressing. ""Paddington"" succeeds in this with flying colors indeed.",Paddington 2

It's a beautiful film the kind that magically reconnects you to the simplicity, nativity, and blithesomeness of childhood, as a kid I used to imagine the world to be like the one Paddington lives in and watching the movie made me reconnect to my younger self and recalled the snug and the warmth induced by such an idealistic perception like Paddington's..and even if it's a kids movie it's full of political and social layers that reflect our times such as discrimination and propoganda and add to it the film is a visual masterpiece with its Wes Anderson and marry Poppins feel. the cinematography and the color grading are definitely Oscar worthy..feels good to fall on a be surprised by such a movie from time to time",Paddington 2
123,michaelberanek275,"Adorable and witty, a perfect package",10,4 September 2018,"Paddington 2 has continued to build on something that works, and has everything in a way a the great Bond franchise has had - broad-spectrum appeal - and may it last as long. The stellar cast work together brilliantly with charm, and humility - considering its underneath a CGA bear, and Grant is central in the supporting line up, and so many more 'proper' actors being as fluffy and winsome as dear Paddington. The bits of detail about both contemporary British culture and apocryphal England too give it that depth and interest that makes it engaging to adults too. I was won over and gave way to the sentimentality without much resistance in no time. I didn't even care it centres on a dotty bunch in an upper-middle class milieu with their cosy privileged lives, as they are all, well, just all so nice! The story has some pace, even some cliff hanging thrills, but not too frantic to overshadow the warm glow throughout, codified in Paddington's Auntie's maxim of seeing the good in everyone. The sight of the old lags in pink prison outfits enjoying French patisseries etc, and finally dancing cabaret was the icing on this ever-so cleverly and kindly made best-of-British confection.",Paddington 2

The audience I saw this with consisted of a wide variety of adults and children and there was laughter from all ages. So many wonderfully laugh inducing moments such as the sight of Mr Brown coping with the separating trains by calling on his chacrobatics (?) lessons. A delightful story, wonderfully acted and with cameos that were perfectly cast. I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Grant but this was his moment as the melodramatic Phoenix Buchanan/tramp/nun/Macbeth etc. But again the hands down winner was the delightful klutzy Paddington, brilliantly brought to life on screen and wonderfully voiced by Ben Wishaw, fortunately he stays true to the Michael Bond character and hasn't been turned into a smart mouthed, foul mouthed, jokey version of himself.

129,MichaelNontonMulu,a feel good family friendly movie about that cute lovable bear,8,14 November 2017,"Just like in the original movie, this one was also truly a family movie. Almost the same formula was used in here where Paddington, being a naive, friendly kind bear caught in trouble due to the bad things done by the villain, and had to be rescued by the Browns. There was definitely a lot of laugh and love around in this movie. So get ready for some funny moments and of course some touching emotional moments.The movie itself focused on the feel-good factor that you would experience when watching it and especially the happiness and emotional sensation after the climax scene in the end. However, this movie was not a very deep one filled with intelligent conversation. Instead it was a light movie filled with scenes where we would be feeling happy or sad for Paddington. Of course some of the things were also a little bit illogical and have a sense of absurdity in it, but we could still tolerate and just enjoy the movie. It was made purely to be enjoyed by the whole family and I think it would be nicer to see this one during Christmas period. I do not know why, but it had a Christmas aura in the movie.The CGI to create Paddington was as nice as the original film, but I especially love the scenes shown during the imagination of Paddington when he was looking at the pop-up book. It was very nice and wonderful to see it and I could actually experience what he was imagining. The Brown family affection and of course the whole neighborhood's appreciation towards Paddington was very lovely to see as well. And be reminded to see the warm feeling when you see the scene involving Brendan Gleeson and his friends. There was a fun mid credit scene that you could enjoy too, but no end credit scene.In the end, this movie was just to be enjoyed and not to be overly thought. You would need to have good imagination and also better to have watched the original movie to have better appreciation of Paddington and the Browns relationship. But even if you did not see the first one, I think you could still understand the movie as it was not too overly complicated. My wife and I were pretty entertained with the movie, especially my wife who had some emotional moments in the touching scenes. We were definitely glad to have seen this one, even though a bit late. The only thing I quite regret was the scenes of the trailer were a bit too much and some of the funny scenes were already shown there. So if you are looking for a family friendly movie with some of those funny moments plus if you want to enjoy seeing that cute cuddly bear with his naivety and kindness to brighten up your day, this one definitely would be a good choice. for my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",Paddington 2
130,walkingwithprimeval,"If I could somehow give this a much higher score rating, I would do!",10,9 February 2020,"Paddington 2 is a brilliant masterpiece! I'm not even joking, to me this is literally 100% perfection! In fact, I'd go so far as to proclaim that this is one of those rare instances when a sequel is vastly superior to its predecessor in almost every way imaginable. As a live-action/CGI hybrid family film, it's on the same respective level as something like Stuart Little 2 (2002) in the sense that its witty antics are genuinely sincere and the comedic moments never feel like they've been forced into the plot, so therefore they felt like a natural extension of it. This type of refined subtle humour will always be more funnier than obnoxiously loud over-the-top humour, which is comparable to dangling shiny keys in front of a kitten for its own mind-numbing amusement.The simplistic-but-effective fish-out-of-water story about Paddington winding up in a prison scenario was an ingenious, original idea because we as the audience have never seen such a humble and kindhearted children's character like him be put into this sort of situation before. And what's even more astonishing is that it felt just like an authentic Paddington story, akin to something you would've seen on the classic Adventures of Paddington Bear cartoon. It's a unique narrative structure if I ever saw one. As far as I'm concerned, director Paul King can do no wrong. Ben Whishaw's terrific vocal performance was spot-on as the pivotal character of Paddington Brown who is just as charming as he's ever been, always being the respectable and well-spoken young bear that he is. Not to mention, his funny lines of dialogue where executed with precision timing. The movie takes its sweet time to build its story up gradually with a nice even pace, good editing and creative cinematography which helps bring life into the well-throughout scenes, also keeping with a consistent tonal balance. It elevates the entire film to a whole new dream-like state in this grand, fantasy world which the filmmakers conceptually fleshed-out. The whimsical sounds of the beautiful background music is the icing on the cake for me because it gives off an old-fashioned fairytale vibe, like you're witnessing a very magical event take place.I'm so glad that a small, independent British film company with some artistic integrity produced this movie and not a big, corporate American studio like Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures, Universal or Paramount, who all undoubtedly would've just ended up butchering it by lazily trying to bank on the brand-recognition of the beloved children's property and disrespect it's source material tremendously by dumbing its content down so much to the point of sheer, irritating stupidity (like what they've always done with their crass live-action/CGI hybrids), thus insulting your intelligence by making nothing but obvious, cliched jokes. For them, it would be more about making it solely for the money and less (or not at all) for the artistry. In those incompetent cash-grabs, the jokes are randomly thrown in at inappropriate times (when there's supposed to be a serious, dramatic scene happening) and feel really out-of-place at certain points. It's almost as if the moronic executive producers where thinking to themselves ""we've got to make sure the little kiddies don't lose interest so let's resort to quickly throwing in a bunch of lowbrow toilet-humour dialogue referencing bodily-functions and other unnecessary gross-out gags"". Paddington deserves so much better than any of that pathetic, trashy garbage!Hands down, Paddington 2 is without a doubt the ultimate family comedy adventure. If you haven't watched this wonderful film by now, all I have to say is... ""have you been living under a rock, or something? Look, just try to see it as soon as possible"".",Paddington 2
131,TimMeade,No Bear is a Failure Who Has Friends,10,17 December 2017,"Sometimes a film can have a warmth and charm transcending its failings to be thoroughly enjoyable; The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was brim full of corny jokes and a pretty ordinary plot - its reviews in the MSM were at best mediocre. But its solid cast and theme of older people who had not given up on the idea of love and sex touched a chord with a mature audience, and it ended up at number three in the Australian box office in 2012 as word of mouth spread.When a film has warmth, and charm, and little to no failings, then you have an instant classic. Everything about Paddington 2 is nigh on pitch perfect; the wonderful cast of British and Irish character actors don't put a foot wrong; Ben Whishaw's voice characterisation now the definitive Paddington; the CGI so good you forget the bear's not real; costume and set design which is inspired; an inventive and amusing plot touched with whimsy; jokes slapstick and meta which rarely miss the mark - look out for the calypso version of the Love Thy Neighbour theme song; locations both London and rural which showcase Britain at its very best; an ending inspired by Capra's It's a Wonderful Life.To make a criticism that the pacing in the second half of the film perhaps fell away just a little at one stage would be like criticising the entire Apollo Space Program for Neil Armstrong's failure to use the indefinite article when saying 'That's one small step for a man'.And the best thing about the movie is that you'll leave the cinema with a fuzzy warmth. Guaranteed.No bear is a failure who has friends.",Paddington 2
132,kikoydaba3,"every bit as personal, quirky, colorful and funny as its predecessor but overall weaker due to script issues",8,5 September 2019,"Paddington 2 is every bit as personal, quirky, colorful and funny as its predecessor. However, the side characters, their motivations, including the villain are weaker.Continuing from a thematic standpoint from its predecessor, Paddington has injected a positive communal spirit as he settles with the Brown's. The story follows Paddington as he comically works his way to buy aunt Lucy a London pop-up book as a present for her birthday when he accidentally becomes the prime suspect in a robbery and subsequently imprisoned.Exploring themes of prison drama and loneliness, the film is an emotionally satisfying conclusion to Paddington and his bear family, albeit faulty in execution. The Brown's efforts to prove Paddington's innocence drags the pacing and doesn't add any layers to the characters or film. The prison drama aspect is not deeply explored, although characters introduced through Paddinton's time inside are funny and good, most especially by Knuckles McGinty played by Brendan Gleeson. Hugh Grant plays the villain Phoenix Buchanan who is a former theater actor reduced to making advertisements for dog food. In terms of performance, Hugh Grant is just as good as Nicole Kidman but is not as strong thematically because his character does not share a special connection to Paddington like Kidman's.Paul King's direction remains spectacular. Both Paddington films are Wes Anderson films for children. The final confrontation on the running train is something big budget blockbusters would envy. Paddington 2 is a great sequel, but one that does not reach the heights of its predecessor.",Paddington 2
133,Camelot_2000,"A Totally ""Feel Good"" Movie",10,7 February 2020,"I admit I've always been a fan of Paddington ever since I was a little kid. Now as an adult, I'm still enjoying the lovable little bear via these two new movies that have recently come out in the past few years.The spirit of what Paddington is all about is perfectly captured here. He's an adorable little bear with the ability to bring out goodness even to the most cruel minded of people. His constant determination of being extremely polite and kind to everyone around him, really does bring out a strong likability to the little guy.The major highlight towards these two Paddington films are the colorful and zany villains that seem to pop out whenever Paddington is trying to maintain a better life for himself in London . Nicole Kidman stole the first film where she borders along the lines of both insanity and oddity as the taxidermist bent on adding the lovable little bear to ""her collection"".Now here comes Hugh Grant as Phoenix Buchanan, a washed up actor reduced to doing dog food commercials. He gets Paddington locked up in the clink over a stolen pop up book of London that he actually stole himself. . Paddington aimed to get that book for his dear Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, but got framed for Phoenix's theft of it and was slapped with a 10 year sentence.The Brown Family are a major highlight here as they strongly believe in Paddington's innocence and do whatever they can to bring the little bear back home again. They do a lot of keen detective work and manage to piece the clues together over what actually occurred. It sounded like a complex effort, but they managed to do it and nail Phoenix as the culprit. That clearly showed how much they loved the little bear and how he was such a strong part of their lives.There's a showdown involving two trains and a pleasing life saving moment, but I won't mention anymore details about that here. I'll leave it for the viewer to see. As one IMDb reviewer pointed out, this movie gives out a strong feeling of ""community' and ""hope"" and ""loyalty"". I found that it went above and beyond that.We all want to be accepted in some way wherever it is we end up and this film perfectly captures that. It's about an innocent and polite little bear from darkest Peru who travels to London for a better life and manages to do so even though obstacles might get in his way sometimes.There's a comforting storybook feel about it all which makes it all the more pleasing. London was beautifully depicted as a thriving utopia while the dark and seamy depths of prison is even made to look like a joyous and uplifting place. An extravagant musical is even capable of happening there.Oh yes, these Paddington films are a high caliber to the franchise that has been successfully going on since the 1950s. The success of these films clearly shows that the appeal of the little bear lives on. His politeness and heartfelt manners will never flicker out.",Paddington 2
134,wolfstar_imdb,"A bad children's movie: cynical overplotted gubbins, full of unearned sentiment and eye-rollingly formulaic character arcs",4,31 December 2017,"This is a frenetic, overplotted cash cow that represents the worst of modern formulaic screenwriting as it hits every plot beat with thudding efficiency and glaringly telegraphs every character moment, never earns the emotions it seeks to elicit, and reimagines the beloved, impish children's character as a disconcerting half-child half-deity, a hollow-eyed sexless avatar of 'British values' that in practice consist of nothing more than being 'nice' and buying shit (preferably from M&S, with whom the film has a commercial tie-in). It is an adventure with no adventure and a fairytale with no magic, and allows its young audience no time for wonder or contemplation and its older audience no time for nostalgia or self-recognition.

136,Popcorn_Media,As good as a freshly made marmalade sandwich.,10,22 November 2017,"As good as a freshly made marmalade sandwich.'Paddington 2' centers around the little bear's wish to find the perfect birthday present for his Aunt Lucy. Visiting Mr Gruber's antique shop he finds a one-of-a-kind pop-up book. Meanwhile as Paddington is out earning money anyway he can to buy the present the book is stolen, leading to Paddington and the Browns working to unmask the thief.Paddington's second adventure is bursting with kindness, humour, warmth and optimism. Mixing live action with CGI, it's a wonderfully enjoyable and brightly coloured romp through a picture postcard pretty London.The cast features some of Britain's most beloved actors all performing to their very best, including Hugh Grant who is magnificently unhinged as the films main villain.It's so so sad that Paddington's creator Michael Bond died in June without seeing how magical this film turned out to be. It's fantastic to see his legacy lives on through top class entertainment like this! It's a beautifully told story which reminds us how we need something loving to make our lives endearing!

143,CitizenKaneAAAAA,An extraordinary bear in a quite ordinary film,7,12 December 2017,"Paddington is an extraordinary bear that when he arrived at London in the first installment, nobody even cared. They treat him as strange as any stanger in London. still, it's funny that they look at him and were like ""ehh... bear"" instead of ""aaaarggghhh bear!"". But hey! it's a family film, nobody cares about that.in this sequel, we are introduced to a new villain and of course a new conflict. Paddington really wants to buy a special gift for his aunt for her birthday. but, somebody stole it. being the kindest bear in the world, he was chasing the thief and accidentally framed as the thief, even though there are no proofs that Paddington possess the stolen gift.the story and characters didn't have any improvements from the first installment. the family still being a kind yet weird family, and Paddington still the best bear in the world. even the conflict still feel as ok as the first one. even though the visual still as great as the first one, i feel like at some sequence or scene, the CGI transition feels a little more creative from the first one.the message and moral of the film is the one that has been talked about million times in a lot of movies before. but that's still not a problem at all. of course we appreciate a G rated film with a cheesy message, because kids love cheese.conclusion is, the film is as good and magical as the first one, with a slight improvement with the visual. it's a film that a lot of conventional kids will enjoy. they don't even have to agree or understand the film, one look at Paddington, and they will fall in love.",Paddington 2
144,ramonster_uk,Practically perfect Paddington production,9,20 November 2017,"I was an unexpected fan of the first Paddington movie, walked into it expecting not to enjoy it, but I was proved wrong. When I heard that a sequel was coming, I just hoped it would retain the magic of the first and it did, with a cherry on top! This movie invoked the inner child within me and was just a perfect viewing experience for this time of the year.The casting was genius, featuring many well known British actors, in roles big and small. It was like a gathering of all the best of British, all having the best of time together. A huge hats off to Hugh Grant, pure brilliance!The imagination that went into this movie and the skill that managed to put this across to the audience was second to none! You will find yourself being absorbed into this world and will not want to leave. I've read some people complaining that this isn't what London is like today, but this is exactly how London was in my childhood mind, where fantasy and reality met. Don't let go of your imagination, suspend reality and just enjoy.I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. You will laugh and you will cry. Go see it, on your own, with your partner or with you family, you won't be disappointed.",Paddington 2

That aside, it's amazing how marmalade sandwiches improves prison life, and good to see cons improved by friendship. Paddington Bear is a genuinely good character, even in sticky situations.

147,keal,I can't believe I'm giving this film 10 stars... but it deserves it!,10,22 January 2018,"I went to see this film simply because the critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes was 100%, and I had already seen the rest of the films at my local theater (Jumanji, Molly's Game, The Commuter) and this was the last thing I had to see before the next week's new shows would come around.I hadn't seen the first Paddington. No one I knew had yet seen Paddington 2. So I saw it knowing nothing except that everyone I talked to loved the first Paddington. Whew. I was floored. I immediately took to the main character. The voice actor is just perfect for Paddington. So polite, and so likeable.I laughed when the kids in the theater laughed, and cried a few times during the heartwarming scenes. The very end scene made me sob because it was so extremely touching. I tell people that this stupid kid's movie made me cry. Paddington 2 is AWESOME.I then watched the first Paddington movie at home. This sequel is better, and you don't need to see the first one to enjoy it, but if you saw the first one? It continues the story with many of the same characters. Not just the main ones, but also the secondary characters!I don't care for films aimed at children, simply because there's enough films aimed at adults like me to take my theater money, but at this very time, with films like Jumanji and The Last Jedi.... Paddington 2 is at the top! If you have to spend your hard-earned money to watch something on the big screen, you will not regret spending it on this!All the prison scenes, and scenes with the characters from the prison, are just the most enjoyable things I've seen in years. Nuckles the chef is just the best! The final scene... I'm talking about the very last 30 seconds of the film... make the whole movie worth more than anything else playing in the theater right now. Bring your tissues!",Paddington 2
148,jezfernandez,One of the finest feel-good family films,10,17 February 2018,"The original Paddington movie was a surprise hit and this follow-up is close to storytelling perfection. It has a simple plot - Paddington is saving up to buy his beloved aunt a pop-up book of London, only the book contains a treasure map and dastardly Hugh Grant wants his hands on it. Cue a series of unfortunate events which see the loveable bear banged up in chokey with Brendan Gleeson, while his beloved family pull out all the stops to clear his name.What makes this film such a delight is the ensemble of truly likeable characters and the writers' steadfast commitment to making this fun. Example? Paddington wins over the entire prison by serving homemade marmalade sandwiches. Hugh Grant is the villain, but he too is rather loveable.This is a movie infused with fantasy, charm and innocence, bursting with genuine laugh-out load performances (such as Richard Ayoade's 2 minute turn as a forensic witness, or Tom Conti's unfortunate haircut victim).Through it all is a theme of pure loyalty and commitment - the unstoppable lengths that people will go to for the ones they love.This is no quick cash-in. The effects are phenomenal, especially Paddington's virtual tour through the pop-up book, and every aspect of the film shows loving care and attention.I defy you not to shed one tear during this terrific adventure, which is right up there with Toy Story 3 for sequel success. If you're in need of a reminder that this world still has a good measure of love and beauty, go spend a couple of hours with the Browns. You won't regret it.",Paddington 2
149,michael-1151,A great legacy to Michael Bond...and marmalade!,10,13 June 2021,"Like many reviewers here, I read Michael Bond's Paddington books as a child and thoroughly enjoyed them, his adventures, innate decency and positive approach were inspirational.Sadly, a blunt pencil is better than a sharp memory and I've forgotten most of the plots - but not the ethos or spirit. Although the author, Michael Bond, died just at the end of filming, this film, as well as the books, provide a lasting legacy.The plot was clever and included a nice heist at an antique shop, with Paddington falsely accused, spending time in clink while the real perpetrator, gloriously portrayed with pantomime-baddie excess by Hugh Grant, a master of disguise, seeming to get off Scott-free.There was a lot of slapstick in the barbers shop - a nice pun from a victim of a Paddington haircut about assault and barbery and a lovable soliloquy damning actors as terrible, devious people!As an aficionado of marmalade pretty-well all my life, I'm at one with the bear and have been since I first read the books.This is a family film to savour - preferably, with a marmalade sandwich.",Paddington 2

It's a child movie, it a sequel too a great film who din't needed a sequel, and it uses CGI for it's main character. This movie had everything to be bad and worst than it first movie who was already a suprise. Yet it's so good ! I'm 14 years old i'm way passed the age of watching movies with small jokes that child love and all, yet I loved the movie mucn more than childs at the theater ! I was focused on this film like I was with Oscar candidate like The Shape of Water, Billboards and all of them, this movie is a decent family movie classic for years to come, Paddington is for me the new Toy Story franchise, since just like Toy Story it has an excellent first movie and yet they still improve for it's sequels! Funny,cute, heart-warming, dazzling,fun, magical and interesting this movie had it all! The cast is great, nothing is missplaced in the movie, the plot makes sense not a single scene is wasted ! The first 20min of introduction are amazing, with all the 80's british nostaligia looking like some Instagram Boomerang while introducing the characters was an excellent scene! The Scrap-Book scene was done brillantly with some insane visuals and a charming way of telling a story! Finnaly almost every scene with Paddington is great, he is cute funny and the visuals or should I say the CGI on him is insane. 
So i'm just saying this may be for now one of my favorite movie of the year and I never thougt I would of said something this crazy only Toy Story and Zootopia made me feel this way! So it his a 10/10 for me great job on the direction the actors, the characters and everyone involved in this movie I truly had a great time!",Paddington 2

So many times beloved characters have had movies made which have been awful beyond belief (the Cat in the Hat), so it is refreshing that the lead character is true to the books. Sure there are plot holes, but Paddington wins over everyone with his goodness and personality. The movie makes a very important point that needs reiterating: one person can make a difference in many lives, and that true friendship is priceless.

Our ursine hero decides upon an expensive old book for his aunt, without realising that nefarious fallen actor Phoenix Buchanan is also interested in the book for essay innocent reasons. Cue a burglary, a bicycle chase and case of mistaken identity that sees our furry innocent sent to prison where he is put in charge of the laundry and immediately falls foul of the prison's resident hard man, Brandon Gleeson playing Nuckles. Naturally the Brown family refuse to believe Paddington's guilt and start a furious campaign to uncover the thief, who is busy solving his own puzzle and following clues from his stolen book in order to uncover a fabulous hidden treasure. This is all very silly, but delivered with such verve and such skill that it is nothing other than utterly charming. It is helped by another terrific script from Paul King and that is packed with sight gags and brief character moments that seem throwaway, but all come into play later on in the film. From Mr. Brown's midlife crisis, to Mrs Brown's swimming challenge, to Phoenix Buchanan's conversations with costumed dummies signifying his greatest roles, every thread is neatly tied up at the end. At its heart though is Paddington himself. A CGI character so well realised that he utterly blends into the film, at no point do you think that's a special effect. Helped by a winning voice work from Ben Whishaw and peerless, flawless animation, Paddington is brought to vivid, wonderful life. In this reviewer's opinion, Paddington could be the most accomplished CGI character yet seen on screen, easily the equal of other celebrated characters such as Cesar or Gollum. He blends into every scene, interacts with the live cast perfectly, and seamlessly delivers the various slapstick gags. Of the rest of the ensemble cast, Hugh Grant just about steals the show, deploying his natural charm and charisma in the service of a rather dislikeable villain, and one with seemingly a number of mental problems. It is a role requiring some complex acting and Grant is more than up to the challenge. His is a humble performance of a huge narcissist and played with an admirable lack of vanity – for example all the glamour shots dotted around Phoenix's house are actual Grant headshots from back in the day. Rumpled, frustrated, smug and convinced of his own ability, it is a great character and lovingly brought to life. Also a hilarious, and utterly ridiculous, post-credits sequence is a Grant highlight and should not be missed. Hugh Bonneville does a great Hugh Bonneville impression as Mr. Brown, but it is of the actor's usually high standard. Julie Walters brings a lot of character to Mrs. Bird, even though the character has very little to do in this film. Brendan Gleason excels as the terrifying Nuckles , growling out lines and barking orders, but unable to withstand Paddington's primary weapon: the hard stare. The rest of the cast, a veritable who's who of British comedy actors, are all superb in their small roles, underlining the sense of community, warmth, and love surrounding a small bear in a big city.If there is a small gripe it is the fact that the film's plot necessitates the sidelining of the Brown family and many of the local community faces all played by well known British comic actors) which is a bit of a shame, but this is a minor gripe. Grant's character is less boo-hiss than Nicole Kidman's in the first film, but this is ultimately to the film's benefit. Paddington 2 is a life-affirming slice of cinematic joy. This is not a kids film with a few jokes thrown in to keep the adults interested, but sweet, thrilling, funny film for everyone. This author (childless, watching with two friends, also childless) was in a matinée show full of kids of all ages but by the end, where there is a moment of drama that should raise a sob from the hardest of hearts, the cinema was utterly silent. Everyone, from grandparents to the tiniest tots, was completely absorbed in the drama on screen. King, his cast and his crew make it look so effortless to pull off this kind of film, to this polished a standard, with this little fuss; it isn't .The original Paddington was a genuine five star family classic, instantly taking its place alongside Mary Poppins and the Jungle Book. Paddington 2, while slightly weaker in some areas, but stronger in others, can sit proudly alongside the original. It is also, fantastically, not an exact re-tread of the original, but instead tells a different story with the same characters and just as well. It also cleverly, and carefully, tells the story as a child may imagine it – from the bringing to life of a pop-up picture book, to the innocent vision of how a prison works - it is an entrancing, beguiling and absurdly colourful view of the world, untainted by adult cynicism. It is a visual return to innocence. This alone should be applauded, but the rate of jokes, the standard of writing, the flawless animation and the sheer heart of the film raise this head and shoulders above most other children's films. Not just the best family film I've seen this year, it could be one of the best films I've seen this year. Perfect family entertainment.",Paddington 2
166,danielfnemes,Better than the first one,9,21 March 2018,"Usually most sequels are worse then the original. Not this one.While Hugh Grant and the other actors are more than fine, the merit comes to the graphic artists. The quality of the animation is noticeably better. Fur looks like real fur, movements are fluid and natural. But, in these days, CGI artists must also act. Their computer generated characters must have the expressivity of a real actor, they must convey emotions. And this is where the movie excels. We have a bear that looks exactly like a real bear. Except it talks. And really touches us. Like a human being. Looking like a bear. A human bear. But still a bear who... you get the idea.The movie has good humor while abstaining to get too cartoonish. A great treat for kids and for the whole family.",Paddington 2

However this film surpassed the first (which was great) Paddington. It was really funny, moving and a delight to watch. I can't wait for number 3. I watched it on telly just the other day, I didn't even know it was on (having seen it twice already) and laughed, probably more than on the previous viewings. Great entertainment.",Paddington 2

Now I can't wait for the 3rdThis is such a heartfelt film that I would challenge anyone who didn't feel a little emotional during the final scenes. It hasn't been tainted by a typical Hollywood script, it stays true to its roots and delivers an incredible family film.Brilliantly funny, with Hugh Grant a perfect fit for the villain. An actor who isn't afraid to make fun of himself and this film fits perfectly. There are so many scenes which you can't help just smile at.The prison scenes were so well put together. What I particularly loved about this film is that there were no lulls, everything had a meaning and flowed perfectly.I am not at all surprised that this film received the praise it did.

I don't know how they do it.That being said, I know mostly everyone loves this Paddington sequel, but I still find it extremely underrated.Something about this movie makes me feel good and magical, and that rarely happens with films. I wish I could watch this in the cinema!",Paddington 2
171,EmbraceTheGeek,Wholesome Family Fun,8,20 June 2018,I saw this on a flight to Japan and I can say that this film was delightful family fun. Very wholesome and it has its funny moments. Story might have been fairly basic but the pacing was still good and kept me engaged. The ending is sweet and heartwarming and the film has a certain charm to it. Did not see the first one but this movie can be watched standalone. It is a very bright and upbeat film filled with color and vibrance. The actors are passionate and overall this film is very positive. Great film for the family to enjoy and I recommend you give this movie a chance.,Paddington 2

No sign of dirty language, crude jokes, kinky scenes - and best of all no political agendas!!! That's right, I watched a movie in 2020 without any eye rolling, puke inducing scenes that involve token actors or forced political messages.Can't we have more movies like this that focus on family, friendship and what it means to really care for someone? It was such a simple, funny and heartwarming film that I will have no hesitation in rewatching. I cried twice too and I'm 34.",Paddington 2

174,jshoesmithkr,Great sequel,9,12 November 2017,"The first Paddington film was cleverly made but just wasn't long enough. This film however lasted longer and had way more to it which made it better. Phoenix as the villain was kind of better than Millicent as he was more cunning. Knuckles was a great addition, how you couldn't like him is just wrong, if you like Knuckles The Echidna then you'll like Knuckles McGinty. Mr Curry could have done more although they gave Mr Gruber a more dominant role like in the books. The scenes were mainly funny. Judy was attractive like in the last film but three years' film difference can emphasize how much actors can change, especially Johnathan and Judy. The prison bit was a bit like Muppets Most Wanted as Paddington befriends his cell mates and then they start to enjoy themselves and then at the end they help his escape, only difference is that some of them join him. Overall a 9/10 for this film. Can't wait for Paddington 3.",Paddington 2

178,colemarisa,"Very cute and clever, but political, so be advised before going with your kids.",3,12 May 2019,"This is extremely well done film, and I wish I could go higher then three stars. Paddington is voiced perfectly, the dialogue is clever, and the characters are adorable. Its a very good blend of plot and dialogue to keep both kids and adults interested, and made me wish there really was a Paddington bear, and that London really looked like the London in the film. Of course that is not what London looks like today at all, and it's looking less like it all the time. The film is also, maybe unintentionally, a push for certain political leanings, and some people might not like that, especially if they see this with their kids and have opposing views. They might feel the movie left unshown the poor little starving orphan boy who could have had a job washing windows if Paddington didn't need to send a gift to his aunt ;). Over all, I gave it 3 stars because while it is a good film, but it is definitely NOT FOR EVERYONE. Or maybe its OK to see it regardless of your views, and you can simply counter the effects by having your kids watch a nature show and see how bears really behave. ;)))))
The final judgement is that it is good, but could have been even better if the writers were more sensitive about such things, so the movie could be enjoyed by everyone.",Paddington 2

It had suspense, originality, thrill, THE BEST comedy and wasn't dumbed down to children's level.This is a rather flat movie (though with good comedy)... Enjoyable to watch ONLY with your family. The plot is quite predictable as the film progresses and the movie has been dumbed down to children's level to make it easy for children to understand everything... which makes it boring to watch for anyone 16+",Paddington 2

However our children refused to go and see it, having heard from school friends that it was terrible. If only we had listened to their wisdom.So my wife and I set off, knowing we had 4 seats to choose from. About 15mins into the movie I realised it still felt like the title credits were rolling. Nothing happened. I started to nod off, but realised my wife was already asleep so fought to stay awake so that one of us would know if something happened.Hugh Grant appeared and was mildly amusing without getting a single laugh. The one laugh I heard in the cinema came from the chef's tattoo. After that the laughs dried up and I spent the last 20mins checking my watch hoping it would end soon. Walking out we both started laughing ( for the first time that night) as we compared notes on how much we hated this film.",Paddington 2

I followed his adventures until it wasn't cool anymore (ah the teenage years) When the first movie came out in 2015, I thought what the heck so I went to a matinee and fell in love all over again. I couldn't wait for Vol 2 to hit the theaters. I was not disappointed. It is sweet, charming, funny and has a good story. It makes you long to have a bear show up on your doorstep so that you could have an adventure. or at least have an Aunt Lucy that you could visit in darkest Peru. Hopefully there will be a volume 3 and it will be just as good. I certainly recommend this film to the young and the young at heart, you won't be disappointed.

My 5-year old and I all laughed at the same parts, which is rare for us. The comedy is physical and visual. Paddington's movements reminded me of Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton. Hugh Grant's self-absorbed thespian was more charming than Nicole Kidman's psychotic taxidermist. The messaging is heart-warming without feeling cheesy.

191,marygracelia22-926-448565,What Paddington is all about - 'Paddington 2' (2017),8,9 December 2017,"As someone who has never read a 'Paddington' story by Michael Bond, I really found some of the reviews here, stating that this second film in the Paddington series is more loyal to the original stories than the first one, to be thought-provoking. Having seen the film for myself now (twice in the cinema, I might add), I can see the reason why they believe so. In some respects, 'Paddington 2' manages to outdo even its charming predecessor.This film starts off with a flashback in the jungles of Peru, like the first 'Paddington'. This lovely scene explains how Paddington was adopted by his beloved Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo. The story continues in London. Paddington is loving his new life with the Brown family, but he wants to find a new job so he can afford a really valuable antique pop-up book from Mr Gruber for Aunt Lucy's birthday. No doubt this film retains most of the charm which made the first film so lovely, including a really fantastic pop-up portrayal of the city of London when Paddington dreams Aunt Lucy has finally come to visit. It just had such a tough standard to live up to, especially since now Paddington is already established in the Brown family. I won't reveal much more of the story, besides saying that this pop-up book which Paddington wants so much gets stolen by a master criminal and Paddington is framed as the thief instead.One thing's for sure, this film's villain is much better than its predecessor's (the villain in the first film is Millicent, as portrayed by Nicole Kidman). As some reviewers have commented, the scary tone the first film tried to associate with Millicent wasn't compatible with Bond's books, despite the producer's efforts to limit this (they cut out most of the scenes which they thought were too scary for children). Therefore, 'Paddington 2' is more loyal to Bond's stories. Hugh Grant as the villain, Phoenix Buchanan, is absolutely fantastic in this regard. His casting was certainly an inspired choice. Most of the other actors did a superb job, including Brendan Gleeson as the intimidating Knuckles who doesn't ""do nothing for no one for nothing"", Peter Capaldi as Mr Curry and Simon Farnaby as the hilarious Barry the security guard from the first film (to mention but a few).This film is perfect for the entire family. I am 23 years old and unashamedly say that I found 'Paddington 2' to be as amusing as it is entertaining, so much so that I didn't mind watching it a second time in the cinema. So don't make the mistake in thinking it's another one of those films that's suitable only for the little ones.",Paddington 2
192,iandbaldwin,You'll believe a bear can fly,10,19 November 2017,"From the opening moments to the end credits this film is a fitting epitaph to the author Michael Bond. I can honestly say this is the best ""children's"" film I have seen since Mary Poppins when I was 6. Like a very good marmalade it is bitter sweet, with moments of comedy that will have tears of laughter running down your cheek and moments of pathos that will do the same - a good thing I was in a darkened cinema. The animators are the star (Paddington) but special mention must be made for Hugh Grant who throws everything at this Oscar worthy role (Don't leave before the end credits or you'll miss one of the best moments) and Brendan Gleeson is suitably menacing and lovable at the same time.Spoiler Alert :- The film flashbacks to Peru when Paddington was rescued by Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo from a fast flowing river. When you see the quality of the animation of this scene you know you are seeing movie platinum. The pop up book that Paddington wants to buy and send to Aunt Lucy for her Birthday present comes to life at the Quayside with Paddington welcoming his aunt to London and showing her the sights - these scenes are inspired and worth the admission price alone. When Paddington gets sent to prison for being wrongly accused of stealing the pop up book his transformation of the prison and the chef Nuckles McGinty (Gleeson) is amazing - and it all starts with marmalade. There are too many other excellent scenes to mention but when Paddington has been cleared and released from prison and is back home he goes to the front door to open it and at this point, thanks to first rate animation throughout, you will believe a bear can fly.",Paddington 2
193,teacher_ball,The very good movie ever!,10,20 May 2019,"Paddington is the very grateful and friendly bear ever. If he is the human, I think he will have many friends at the school.

He changes everything in the prison when Paddington in there he makes many friends and the prisoners are very happy too. So, I like this movie very much!",Paddington 2
194,NikolaiDante,"Unbelievably good, brings back all those Paddington memories",10,13 November 2017,"I used to read all the Paddington books when I was a small boy and my wife when she was a little girl. We both loved all the crazy escapades that Paddington got into and he did it all with a good heart.I very much enjoyed seeing the first Paddington but did feel it wasn't quite Paddington with the scary woman and the scary scenes.Paddington 2 completely captures the essence of the the books and really wrings out the most of some of the characters.Brendan Gleeson is superb as the 'nasty' Knuckles who quickly warms to Paddington. This might sound far-fetched but the whole film is very childish. Now that's not childish in the sense of ""silly and immature"" but in the other definition of ""appropriate to a child"". The whole film shows and plays scenes as a child might imagine things to be - for example how the prison works and especially the lovely idea that the warden reads the inmates a bedtime story to help them all get to sleep.There are superb performance from all the actors and a huge number of cameos. Even the small scenes put in by the like of Joanna Lumley and Rob Brydon are clearly done with great love from the actors. Hugh Grant puts in a superb over the top performance as the baddie, which really let him flex his vocal talents!The whole film is done in bright colours and with a superb musical backing track. When you are watching the film be careful to pay attention to all the small details, such as the newspaper headlines and the To Do list in the Brown's Kitchen, there a huge number of little jokes in the background and I suspect I'll spot a whole load more when I watch this again on Blu-Ray!Not really spoilers but there is only one really 'scary' scene near the end but it is so beautifully done and you know that Paddington will win so even the little ones won't cry. And make sure you stay for ALL the credits as they play out to an amazing ""what happened after"" montage.I have noticed that that at the time of writing this review there were 927 votes and 15 people have given the film a 1-star. Now I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but in this case I suspect these people might not really understand Paddington and what he's all about, if you have young children and they love Paddington then they will love this film.This film is suitable for young children aged 4 to 104 :)Let you into a secret, when my wife and I went to watch this film there were a lot of people in the cinema but not one was under 18! From the looks of it the audience was aged 20 - 80!I cried and I laughed through the whole film and rekindled my inner Paddington.",Paddington 2

203,snakekeeper-11956,Be the best version of yourself,7,11 January 2018,"If Paddington 2 was a motivation speech, it would be titled as: ""be the best version of yourself"". At the same time, if the original movie causes you a nervous shake like: ""how it is bearable for people to watch animated Teddy bear eating bread with orange jam"", you should also pass by this premiere. But for those, who fully conscious of what is going on behind the cinema doors, Paddington 2 is almost a perfect family movie for all ages. Foreseeable indeed, childly naïve indeed, but therefore charming. While looking narrowly, you start to notice some movie encouragers. The xtreme positive vision of the protagonist and an obscure version of a world without him from ""It's a beautiful life"". The visual style of many-colored fairy-tale from ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". Treasure hunting quest with clues from ""National treasure"". And even stealth burlesque on ""Mission impossible"". Movie pinches off good ideas of the past just enough not to be disappointed. While we can relatively divide 100-minute timeline into scenes with the presence of Mr. Paddington Brown and focus on other characters, well-played ideas and creativity are all way here. The very scene of cartoon visualization of London, we have previously seen in trailers, fascinates. Paddington 2 does not permit his viewer to be bored, being both cute and funny. Sequel even satisfies us with a charismatic antagonist, performed by Hugh Grant. And every member of a friendly Brown family now endued with a positive quality, pointed out with Chekhov's gun in the very beginning.",Paddington 2
204,rthomp-8,Farage - watch Paddington 2 instead of Dunkirk,8,20 November 2017,"I've got nothing against the film Dunkirk or its important place in the history of the world in standing up to tyranny. It's just that as soon as Nigel Farage suggested that every British schoolboy should watch it, I decided not to go.I'd suggest watching Paddington 2 instead. Its message is that tolerance, immigration and difference are good things.The film itself is lovely. The story doesn't stack up quite as well as the first one, but each individual scene is gorgeous. Where Nicole Kidman was evil as the baddie, Hugh Grant is self obsessed and bumbling.The sets are beautifully done. I kept thinking of Wes Anderson and The Grand Budapest Hotel. The scene with Paddington exploring a pop up book is probably the best of the lot. The humour is excellent.",Paddington 2
205,theanimatoradam,The best film of 2017,10,31 March 2019,"Hands down, the best film of 2017.
The first Paddington film was a fantastic family movie, full of great charm and comedy, with great cinematography, physical humour and sweetness.
Paddington 2 is all of that, but this time around the villain is just as much fun as the Brown family and the bear himself. Nobody can watch this film and not fall in love with just how much care and detail went into making this heartwarming little bear's story shine with a variety of animation styles layered on top of great live action performances and genuinely inspired character set-pieces. It's cute, it's funny, it's almost akin to watching cat videos on the internet without the repetition and still manages not to be too saccharin and turn audiences away.
This one, even more-so than the last, is movie magic.",Paddington 2

208,pmoonoak,Sheer Magic,9,31 August 2018,"I generally don't care for ""children's"" films, but ever since the day my partner and I saw the poster for Paddington 2 in the window of Harrod's, I've wanted to see it, and I was not disappointed. What a delight this movie is, from beginning to end. The animation melds seamlessly with the live action, the story is thoroughly enchanting, and the acting is more than satisfactory. The adventures of a bear from Darkest Peru fits into the British tradition of talking-animal whimsy along with Winnie-the-Pooh, The Wind in the Willows, and Peter Rabbit (also made into a film), but P2 is, for me, the best of the recent cinematic interpretations of these beloved stories. Highly recommended for everyone.",Paddington 2

Even better than the first! One minute I'm cracking up, one minute I'm tearing up and the whole time my jaw is on the ground from the visual effects. Great for the whole family.

I hope they make a third!",Paddington 2
210,lance135,A True Gem of a Family Film,10,1 February 2018,"The first Paddington movie was a wonderful surprise and Paddington 2 may be even better. Not only is it a heartwarming story about a talking bear that lives with a family in London, it's also visually impressive.Each scene is a work of art. In fact, I would say that you could freeze on practically any frame and make that the movie poster. It is meticulously crafted film making at its finest. Kudos to the director, DOP, set and costume designers, ma, storyboard and graphics artists for making such a work of art!It is mostly the same brilliant cast as the previous film with the addition of Hugh Grant, who is perfect as a self-absorbed actor. Other standout performances include Ben Wishaw as Paddington, Sally Hawkins as the matriarch of the family - a fiercely loyal guardian of Paddington - and Brendan Gleesan as Knuckles.The story is not terribly original, unless you think that a bear getting trouble is an original idea, but it is well-executed. Paddington lives in a reality where everyone is expected to have good manners and the only weapon you need is a hard stare. He tends to make everyone around him be a bit better for having known him. His weakness for marmalade and propensity for slapstick are really his only flaws.I really don't give out perfect 10 scores very often, but this rare film deserves it. See it, show it to your children, and know that the world is a slightly brighter place because of it.",Paddington 2
211,bram-81557,"Paddington 2: Satisfaction level: 99,9%",8,3 January 2018,"Expectations were high, maybe too high. But just like the first movie this is great filmmaking. What makes the film that good is that the character Paddington fits so perfectly into the story and the world the makers created. His world is warm, funny, carefree, bit of hipster and rather naive. Nevertheless you see him grow up in this movie, just like his main audience. It's a bit more educational and grown up than the first film. Despite that it stays playful. What I love are all the short scenes in between, they're fast, full of detail and the filmmakers show there diversity. Every aspect of this movie stays at the same constant level, it's perfectly balanced. But you know there's something missing. And just at the moment you think it's over Hugh Grant drops a crazy musical song. But also this climax isn't totally over the top. That's because director Paul King stays so close to his characters, world and audience. Maybe it isn't necessarily a bad thing that the film doesn't gives you what you want.

The cast is the treasure in this show, from the outstanding Sally Hawkins to Papa Bear himself, Hugh Bonneville. And how is that Hugh Grant has a thing acting as the failed actor? Well, he's over the top and wonderful in this flic. Oddly, Paddington himself didn't overwhelm me.

219,tanernwei,Beyond all considerable definitions of a perfect film.,10,19 March 2019,"In a rather unusual turn of events, this sequel manages to both seamlessly further the direction and development of its characters and themes from the first film, while being an entirely new and original movie.With the first film ending as satisfactory as it was, it seemed rather unnecessary to me to pursue a sequel, yet the return of the talent from the first film left me positively thrilled at the prospect of something topping the experience I had with Paddington. I could not have been more happy to discover that Paddington 2 not only more than fulfills everything one could ask for in a sequel, but that the filmmakers do indeed have more amazing stories to tell, and more amazing ways to tell them.The entire film has so beautifully redefined the word 'HAPPY', in a time and generation so in need of such penetrations of indisputable joy. Paddington 2 delivers a quirky, thrilling, comedic, yet extremely mature and wise look at life as it rather should be.The Paddington movies look for, and model for us, the best in us. And gosh darn it if Mr Brown didn't put it perfectly: ""Paddington looks for the best in each of us, and somehow, he finds it.""All in all, Paddington 2 is a movie we never could have had the wisdom or imaginative capability to ask for, yet, Thank God, we have been graciously given.There are no clear words I have in my power to express what exactly it is about this film that makes it the most perfect film I have ever beheld, to come even close to adequately express its genius would be to do in depth studies of each scene, of each conversation. And finding the time to do such a study, for a student, is quite frankly next to impossible. But if there's one thing that Paddington 2 has showed me, it's that the facade that we call maturity is often a bunch of no-good reasons we have for settling for imperfection. While the film definitely does not preach naivety, in reality, why not? Why can't we push for peace in a turbulent world without us diluting peace with our ideas of what an achievable peace is?If God were to give us what we asked for overnight, would we be quite disappointed that what we asked for was less than perfect? Well if we would only dare to ask for perfection, I have no doubt that Paddington would rank very high in the pile of perfect gifts our heavenly gift-giver would so gladly bestow upon our undeserving souls. Paddington 2 is glimpse at a perfect reality that we must NEVER lose sight of for the sake of a mask of maturity that can easily be turned into a blindfold of misplaced distrust. Don't let hurts rob you of the glimpse that each of us has of perfection, so beautifully captured in the motion picture that is Paddington 2.God bless.
He certainly does. This film is proof of it.",Paddington 2
220,redsoundcool,Amazing...,10,3 July 2019,"The movie put you through many emotions, and showed the touching relationships Paddington has gained and gains!",Paddington 2
221,sacr-79839,A Stand on Cynicism,10,5 December 2020,"When I watched the first Paddington movie, I didn't think too much into it. It was definitely good, but it wasn't a film too interesting to review or to think that much into. It was a very well-made film. And in the case of this sequel Paul King and the rest of the creative team made a choice that you wouldn't really expect in these times: they didn't go bigger. Actually, I would argue that they went smaller. Because, in opposition to the first movie, Paddington 2 makes its protagonist (played by the ever so wonderful Ben Whishaw) go into a quest of gratitude to the person that allowed him the possibility of finally visiting the magical place he was always told about as a cub, this person (bear, really) being Aunt Lucy, played so wholeheartedly by Imelda Staunton in the very few scenes she appears in. The plot of Paddington 2 is essentially Paddington Bear looking for the best birthday present for her aunt, a plot with such a simplicity that would make a film executive question the possibility of this film ever being successful. But the thing here is that the simplicity of the gesture Paddington is looking to do, pushes him to absurd lengths to achieve his goal, but not in the Taken way of ""I have to do whatever I have to do to get my daughter back"", but more in the Paddington way of ""I have to do this because it is the best way I can express my gratitude to somebody who gave so much"".
And in the same way Paddington wants to manifest his love to his aunt Lucy through out the course of the film, I don't think I will be able to do the same for this film beyond me writing this review. Because, beyond the excellent CGI work made on Paddington, the impressive production design made by Gary Williamson and the delightfully charming cast of actors present in the film (with Hugh Grant and Brendan Gleeson standing out from the crowd), this movie wowed me because it has the objective of fighting the need to be cynical. Every single frame of the film is played straight, with no attempt made by the comedy to mock Paddington and his quest to prove that he is not a criminal or his intention to change a seemingly irredeemable prison cook through the art of making marmalade sandwiches, helping every prisoner to be better people in the process (which eventually leads to the best post-credit scene in film history when it comes to my humble opinion). And after watching the aforementioned scene once more, I find myself vigorous to affirm once more that the values this film establishes - to quote Paddington quoting Aunt Lucy ""if we're kind and polite, the world will be right"" - should be taught in schools and played as deadly seriously as this film does. Because, as you may know, the world is a very dark place right now. Not necessarily because of the pandemic that we're living through at the time that I write this (although it certainly is a factor), but because of how people tend to treat each other nowadays, not only in social media but in face to face situations as well. Our relationships are usually violent and if not, they can be utilitarian or toxic, very few times allowing the possibility of real emotion being able to flourish, maybe this having to do with the fact that we're more keen to close ourselves up in order to project a certain image.
I know this is a fairly mature topic to be referring to in a Paddington 2 review, but I think it is relevant to the nature of the film: in 2017, the year a president of the United States, one of the most powerful countries in the world, who ran a campaign based on lies, hate and basically everything you should tell a child not to do, takes office to imprint this values within its borders and beyond them, the worst thing about him being that he is not the only one. But in that same year, an immigrant bear from Darkest Peru living in London who improved a whole community within the city, attempts to get a present to the person who allowed him to be the good hearted individual that he is. If this movie shows anything, is that no matter who you are, where you come from or where you are right now, you can still do good. The thing about this movie is not the fact that it really isn't a work of art that should be torn down to understand the nature of its greatness. It's just a movie looking to put out a positive message through the art of emotion that cinema is out into the world with much more effort than what it would take to tweet or write under a YouTube video ""bless you if you read this message"". And that is something that should be valued more than anything in the world.",Paddington 2
222,small_benjamin,What an amazing General Movie,10,17 May 2019,"Paddington 2 is a triumph of many aspects of filmmaking. First off the cgi is incredible and Ben Winshaw knocks it out of the park again as ""Our Favourite Bear"" Paddington. Secondly the Cinematography is abosuley gorgeous and feels more realistic than the first film.

Hugh Grant was superb as an aged floppy old theatre lovie- great comedic timing and a hoot to watch and Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abby) was equally as fab. Julie Walters adds her usual finesse.

Boy was I wrong! This is such a good sequel, I want to watch it over and over. It starts with Paddington doing several jobs to save money for an antique pop up book that he intends to give to his Aunt Lucy for her birthday. However, a thief steals the book and frames Paddington, leading to him being imprisoned. And I just have to say, Paddington himself is so kind and warm hearted, he actually makes prison life fun for the inmates.

The movie is an advantageous comedy which took place in London.The movie was a fine day, he spots a pop-up book in an antique shop -- the perfect present for his beloved aunt's 100th birthday. When a thief steals the prized book, Paddington embarks on an epic quest to unmask the culprit before Aunt Lucy's big celebration. In conclusion, this movie is very good for people who love watching action comedy is because they combine the genre of the movie perfectly. This movie has a meaning that tell us that if a good person like the bear will have a happy ending while the bad ones will get consequences.

There i was, a 20 year old, sitting in between at least 8 ten year olds, cheering for the charming Brown family and of course, the adorable Paddington. It is a delight for all, with clever and tasteful British humour that will satisfy all viewers, from 5 year olds (i actually witnessed a 5 year old laughing her heart out at the screening i was at) to full grown adults (many parents and also my mom who i was seeing this movie with, had a blast seeing many, more adult- oriented, but still appropriate and child-friendly themes throughout the movie).The casting is great, plenty of A-lister Brits give an endearing performance and for not once will you think they did it for an easy paycheck. The film is pleasant for the eyes and has a positive, vibrant color-scheme. The plot is good, does not have that well- feared ""sequel syndrome"" (which i was indeed a bit sceptical about before buying the ticket) and can very well stand on its own.

262,sjagadeesan,Not Just a Great Family Movie.... But a Great Movie,10,10 June 2019,"I must admit first that I've never read any of the Paddington books to which this movie is inspired by. However, it is not hard to fall in love with this bear. In fact, this movie is not hard to fall in love with.The acting is superb in this film. Everyone gives it their absolute all, especially Hugh Grant who is cast against type but still is the charming Brit who we all first fell in love with in Notting Hill. Brendan Gleeson should also be given praise for his role as the mean Knuckles who eventually warms up to Paddington, as do all the characters. The only complaint that I have is with the character played by Peter Capaldi, who seems to be the only character not to go through any significant change.The comedy is also done really well in Paddington 2. Though it is a children's movie, it does not fall into the tropes that other children movies are notorious for (i.e. Illumination Entertainment). The comedy is done really well that the youngest of children and the oldest of adults can all laugh and enjoy it the same.All in all, this is a movie that you can enjoy with the whole family, or even by yourself. It's not just a great family movie, its a great movie altogether. It's probably the most enjoyable film I've seen this year.",Paddington 2
263,kel-81803,A rare sequel that is as good as the first movie!,9,26 September 2018,"Not sure why it took so long to watch this movie, as it has been out for some time.Really enjoyed the first movie, sat to watch it with my kids, and was expecting it to be boring, but found it really well made. Really witty writing, I'm guessing English writing, as it seems to have dry, witty English writing style.Didn't feel like the movie really continued on from the first movie, or did I miss something? Anyway amazing CGI, and an outstanding cast, with Hugh Grant, the father (Hugh Bonneville), Nuckles from prison (Brendan Gleeson), and some strong supporting actors like Richard Ayoade, and Noah Taylor were great to see in the movie as well.Real campy acting scenes in the prison, especially with the musical at the end. I really hate musicals but didn't mind it and LOLD with my son, i think by the end you are so immersed all of it is a laugh.Great to see the family, well the mum and the children sticking by Paddington's side, even when no-one else did, and they pretty much saved him at the end by opening the roof in the carriage so the bad guy Phoenix Bucchanen fell into the hole and got captured.The part at the end when Paddington almost drowned and is saved by Knuckles just in time. Try not crying, if you don't there's something wrong with you !",Paddington 2
264,spammeifyoudare,Sentimental but forced plot points.,7,13 December 2018,"Movie was a very charming and feel good family movie. However even for a children's story it wasn't written well in some places. We can accept the impossibility of a talking bear but there were many improbabilities that we're jarring and ruined the immersion of the story. Some were frustrating to watch especially if they're the main plot points.Spoilers now...1. Paddington was imprisoned for theft of the book but we wasn't in possession of the book. He was caught *ahem* bare handed. The store owner didn't even press charges but was favorable to Paddington. Why was the crown prosecuting a bear? Charges should only be breaking and entering. The law was awfully strict here. Poor motive for theft since everyone witnessed him trying to save money to buy the book. This plot point was rather forced.2. But at the end credits the prisoners that escaped for pardoned? So the law was lenient now to make everything all nice and resolved. Prison break should have been punished severely by they were pardoned.,3. When the inmates came to help free Paddington underwater, the strength of 3 men and a woman was able to break a lock by brute force? Seemed unlikely.4. When the bad guy caught the Browns breaking into his house, they were let off for half baked reasons.There were other lesser instances but this isn't Cinema Sin's
5. Even though Paddington was innocent he broke out of prison and wasn't punished for it.6. Bad guy getting hit in the head by a ball at the entrance of the train door to the outside, and instead of falling backwards, he fainted and fell forwards. Might have happened but felt weird.7. The bad guy's vanity was overplayed a little particularly during trial (but so guess this is a kids movie after all)",Paddington 2

The perfect movie that not make the watchers curious of the bad guy and that makes me enjoy the movie! It's suitable to watch with your family, old and young!",Paddington 2
