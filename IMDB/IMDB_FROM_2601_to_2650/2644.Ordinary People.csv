0,MartinHafer,One of the finest and most true to life movies ever,10,6 February 2006,"I might consider putting this movie in my top 10 list of best movies. It's absolutely amazing that for his directorial debut, Robert Redford created such a masterpiece. Now it was not all due to him, as the story was so well-written and the acting is dead on for all the characters. Part of the reason I love it so much might be because I was a psychotherapist before becoming a school teacher (mid-life crisis, you know). And, having worked with dysfunctional families, this movie gets it right time and time again. Therapy is not a miracle cure that takes effect almost immediately (like in GOOD WILL HUNTING) and the parents BOTH have a strong role in keeping the family sickness alive. Donald Sutherland is the enabler who denies there is a problem--even after one son dies by accident and the other attempts suicide. He also cannot face that the family's dysfunction is mostly controlled and maintained by his very disturbed wife, played wonderfully by Mary Tyler Moore. She is not mentally ill but has a very sick personality, as she is cold as ice emotionally and deals with problems through massive amounts of denial as well as stuffing her anger WAY down deep. Timothy Hutton is, despite his being the patient, the healthiest one in the family, as his suicide attempt is a strong cry for help. Finally, Judd Hirsch plays the therapist--and one of the most realistically portrayed therapists on film. He has no miracle cure but tries his best to get Hutton, and later Sutherland, to work hard at uncovering their dysfunction. Again and again and again, the viewer is rewarded by a brutally honest script that is about people who would be real--not Hollywood's idea of ""people"". The film is neither manipulative nor condescending--this is the way more films SHOULD be.In addition, as I have watched the film several times, I keep noticing just how perfect the direction was. How wonderfully framed the shots were, how wonderfully the music fit in and how unflinching the movie dealt with pain. In particular, I love the scene with Sutherland at the psychiatrist's office as he talks about his marriage....and his eyes keep looking away and avoiding the doctor as he says how much he loves her. And the great Christmas photo scene--it just screams out ""this is real!!"". For this to be Robert Redford's directorial debut is absolutely amazing and he surely earned that Best Director Oscar.FYI--although this movie is rated R, it is only for language. There are a few REALLY CHOICE WORDS used here and there, but otherwise this is a great movie for teens. If filmed today, this would no doubt be a PG-13 film. I am a very conservative parent, and yet I found this to be totally acceptable for my 15 year-old. It's a great film to watch WITH your kids and discuss what you see.I cannot recommend a film more highly.",Ordinary People
1,TheLittleSongbird,Incredibly moving and beautifully acted,10,5 June 2011,"1980 saw the release of what I consider three masterpieces, Raging Bull, The Elephant Man and this film. Ordinary People I have seen people trash as the movie that beat Raging Bull, though not as vehemently as that of Shakespeare in Love vs. Saving Private Ryan(disagree with the hate), The English Patient vs Fargo(also disagree) and Crash vs. Brokeback Mountain(disliked the former, adore the latter, so I agree). Okay, Raging Bull is a wonderful movie, but so is Ordinary People.Why do I love Ordinary People? Well it is a very moving film. It deals very diligently and intelligently with its subject matter, and when I saw it with my parents first time none of us were dry-eyed at the film's end. It is stunningly filmed, is beautifully scripted and Robert Redford in his directorial debut directs very promisingly. The story is always interesting and believable, and while the film is quite leisurely because of the impact, how the characters are written and how good the acting is I never find it dull.The characters are engaging and I do care for them. Mary Tyler Moore's character is more highly strung than a piano wire and she is a bit of a bitch too, but Moore's performance is so exceptional here you do empathise with her too. Both Donald Sutherland(as the character I personally sympathise with most) and Timothy Hutton are perfect in their roles as well. In conclusion, moving and acted to perfection, while not my immediate Best Picture winner that year perhaps it is a deserving one in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Ordinary People
2,bkoganbing,Meet The Jarretts,10,21 January 2009,"At first glance the Jarrett family from a wealthy Chicago suburb seem to have the American dream realized. But a boating accident that took the life of the oldest of Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore's two boys has brought out a few monsters from everybody's Id in the family that remains. The most obvious manifestation is younger son Timothy Hutton's suicide attempt. He's know back in his posh suburban high school trying to adjust, but getting little support from home, especially from mom.Mary's in complete denial, she's one strange bird in this one, determined not to let any tragedy spoil her well ordered country club existence. Hutton's inability to cope is a reminder of something she's just put away. Sutherland's a decent man who with job responsibilities just can't deal with either wife or son.Trying to straighten it all out, especially Hutton is psychiatrist Judd Hirsch in what is probably his best big screen role. At the end of Ordinary People, some things are resolved, but the future for the Jarrett family is not a happily ever after one assured.Ordinary People got the big prizes, Best Film, Best Director for Robert Redford who really gets deep into the psyches of the Jarrett family and best adapted screenplay. Mary Tyler Moore lost for Best Actress to the Coalminer's Daughter, Sissy Spacek.Both Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and usually that means they cancel each other out in the voting. But not this time, Hutton won the award. That's a shame in the sense that the key scene of the film is his breakdown and Hirsch's breakthrough with him after another tragedy befalls a female friend of Hutton's. The two of them are both so good in this that it's a shame that only one could win. A joint award in this case would have been in order.Ordinary People is a riveting psychodrama about the hidden things we suppress. Drama does not get better than Ordinary People.",Ordinary People
3,SnoopyStyle,compelling performance of compelling character,8,28 October 2015,"The Jarretts are a well-off family in suburban Chicago. Only son Conrad (Timothy Hutton) is struggling and sees psychiatrist Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch). His older brother Buck died in a sailing accident. His parents Calvin (Donald Sutherland) and Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) don't talk about it or anything of deep substance. Conrad starts dating fellow student Jeannine Pratt (Elizabeth McGovern) and quits competitive swimming.Timothy Hutton delivers a compelling performance for his demanding character. This is all about the secret and the rolling revelation. Unlike other movies, it isn't too cute with it. It's hidden for a reason. It fits the characters. They can hardly say his name out loud. It's a bit slow in the first half but it's never boring. As Conrad breaks down, the movie goes to another level. It's a skilled debut for Robert Redford as the director.",Ordinary People
4,Kirpianuscus,great work,10,21 April 2016,"it is one of my favorite films. for its honest portrait of a family's crisis. for the high performances. for the exploration of confuse universe of a teenager. for the wise manner to define the need to be yourself. and for its message. a film about life who could be sentimental or bitter. it is only honest. like a testimony about choices, words, secrets and need of the other. about selfish and courage to see the other. Robert Redford does a brilliant job. and that is the axis for a drama who seems special for using a large category of crisis. because it suggest more than propose. because it not gives answers but few questions. Conrad of Timoty Hutton is one of characters who discovers many hidden aspects of the viewer's life. to suggest is the key of its strange beauty. and the precise construction of each scene. a film about solitude and guilty and truth. remarkable altogether.",Ordinary People
5,Prismark10,Pulling through,8,28 May 2016,"Ordinary People is an ironic title. The main players are far from ordinary, suffering a trauma of the death of the eldest child in a sailing accident. They also are what could be termed middle class, even upper middle class but not ordinary.Ordinary People was the directorial debut of superstar actor Robert Redford who makes a small, intimate, unflashy picture with his main strengths being the acting from its cast.Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton) feels guilty about his brother's death because he survived the incident and Buck did not. He attempts to commit suicide which has led to an extended stay in hospital.Returning home he is trying to rebuild his life. His father Cal (Donald Sutherland) is understanding, patient and wants him to continue his recovery by seeing a psychiatrist. His mother Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) loved her eldest son but seems cold and distant when it comes to Conrad. She wants life to carry on as before and for Conrad to get over it. Conrad arranges to see Dr Berger (Judd Hirsch) who helps Conrad and in due course even his father also goes to see Dr Berger as well.At the time the subject matter was not something that was intelligently dealt with in mainstream movies. Now it is a common television of the week subject matter.The film delves into Conrad's psyche. A precocious teenager who is lost. One friend he knew from hospital and who seems to be pulling through later dies. Eventually it is Dr Berger who gets through to him and it is his father's understanding he comes to appreciate.The film also examines Cal and Beth. Parents who have lost a child, nearly lost another and their differing ways in dealing with this. Redford confounds the audience by making the mother brittle and aloof. Tyler-Moore known for comedies pulls out a character that is all too real. She is a strong and determined woman and yet behind it all hiding her pain, putting a brave face to the world and wondering why the others could not do the same. She was nominated for a best actress Oscar.Sutherland failed to be nominated for his perceptive and kind father, he provides the warmth that Conrad needs and he also realises at the end that he and Beth are over.Ordinary People won the Oscar for Best Picture and Best Director for Redford. It beat the more flashy and controversial Raging Bull which came to be regarded as the best film of the 1980s. Timothy Hutton who had the lion's share of the film won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. A cynical move to shield him from the Best Actor category as the producers knew he would be no match that year from the Robert De Niro avalanche.Ordinary People is an examination of middle class mores and middle class life in crisis in late 1970s/early 1980s America.",Ordinary People
6,claudio_carvalho,Powerful and Heartbreaking Drama,8,27 July 2015,"In Illinois, the upper-middle-class family Jarrett is living a trauma in their lives, with the loss of their beloved son Buck followed by the attempt of suicide of his younger brother Conrad (Timothy Hutton). Conrad's father Calvin (Donald Sutherland) is a good man of few words and his mother Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) is a cold-hearted woman that loved Buck and has always been bitter and never supported Conrad, who is under therapy with Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch). The greatest concern of Beth is to live her perfect life, denying affection to her son. Conrad blames himself for the death of his brother since they were sailing in a bad weather and when one string jammed in the block, he was not able to release it, capsizing the boat. Conrad has difficulties to reestablish his relationship with his friend and quits the swimming team of his school.When Conrad meets Karen (Dinah Manoff), who was interned with him in the same psychiatric clinic also for attempt suicide, he feels better. And when he dates the gorgeous student from the choir Jeannine (Elizabeth McGovern), he begins to see the world with other eyes. But his problem of relationship with his mother associated to the death of Karen, who committed suicide, brings him back to the rock bottom and he runs to meet Dr. Berger. Will the psychiatrist succeed in helping Conrad? ""Ordinary People"" is a powerful and heartbreaking drama, one of the best American dramas from the 80's. This film is also a milestone in the career of Robert Redford since it is his directorial debut. ""Ordinary People"" has top-notch direction and performances; the screenplay is very well-written with powerful lines. The timeless story is well-resolved with the realistic decision of the shattered Jarrett family. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Gente Como a Gente"" (""People Like Us"")",Ordinary People
7,gavin6942,A Bit Dry,6,4 August 2015,"The accidental death of the older son of an affluent family deeply strains the relationships among the bitter mother, the good-natured father, and the guilt-ridden younger son.Robert Redford and Timothy Hutton both won Academy Awards for their respective debuts: Redford as Best Director and Hutton, in his first film (he had previously appeared on television), as Best Supporting Actor. The film marked Mary Tyler Moore's career breakout from the personality of her other two famous roles as Laura Petrie on The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mary Richards on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Moore's complex performance was well-received and obtained a nomination for Best Actress. The film also won Best Picture for 1980.Roger Ebert gave it four stars, calling it ""one of the year's best films, probably of the decade"" and later named it the fifth best film of the year 1980. Gene Siskel likewise ranked it the second best film of 1980. Both of them ended up giving ""Raging Bull"" a higher slot on the year's list, which is probably correct. The movie is a bit dry, and maybe does not age as well as it could.",Ordinary People
8,jboothmillard,Ordinary People,7,5 September 2013,"I had a heard a little about this film before reading it in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, mainly that this was directorial debut from actor Robert Redford (Quiz Show, The Legend of Bagger Vance), and he won the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Director, and it won Best Picture as well, so I had to see if it was deserved. Basically upper middle class suburban Chicago family the Jarretts are trying to return to normal life following the death of teenage son Jordan 'Buck'(Scott Doebler) in a boating accident, and shortly after this his brother Conrad (Oscar and twice Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Timothy Hutton) attempted to commit suicide and spent four months in an psychiatric hospital. Conrad has returned to high school and senior year, he tries partaking in activities such as swimming and choir, but feeling alienated by lively but awkward father Calvin (Golden Globe nominated Donald Sutherland) and denying and secretly cold mother Beth (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Mary Tyler Moore) he restarts psychiatric therapy outside the hospital with Dr. Tyrone Berger (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Judd Hirsch). Calvin tries a few attempts to connect with his surviving son, while Beth tries to stay composed in order to maintain perfection and normality for the family, and Conrad, going through unorthodox session with Dr. Berger still finds difficulty communicating with his parents, but he starts dating fellow student Jeannine Pratt (Elizabeth McGovern) who gives him optimism. Conrad and mother Beth often argue, and Calvin in the heat of the moment often takes sides with his son, but discovering his after school psychiatric session an argument becomes very heated, and later taking a trip to Houston an argument ignites between Beth and Calvin, he has a rage, and she explains feeling repressed. Conrad has a breakdown when he finds out fellow psychiatric hospital friend Karen Aldrich (Dinah Manoff) has committed suicide, but a breakthrough session with Dr. Berger helps him to stop blaming himself for the death of Buck, as he was there with him, and in the end Beth leaves home following a last emotional talk with her husband, so Calvin and Conrad cope with their new situation and try to connect at last. Also starring M. Emmet Walsh as Coach Salan, Fredric Lehne as Joe Lazenby, James B. Sikking as Ray, Basil Hoffman as Sloan, Quinn K. Redeker as Ward, Mariclare Costello as Audrey, Meg Mundy as Grandmother and Independence Day's Adam Baldwin as Stillman (no relation to Alec, Stephen or the others). Tyler Moore gives a great performance as the elegant woman socialising and putting on a smile but is actually suffering within, Sutherland is interesting as the father who is cheerful but perhaps equally stressed, Hutton is deserving of his accolade being the distressed teenager trying to feel loved and make sense of where he is going in life, and Hirsch is likable as the psychiatric doctor with unusual methods to get into the mindset of his patient and bring out true feelings. When I know films like The Elephant Man and Raging Bull were released the same year during Oscar season, I question the wins for Best Picture and Best Director, but I can understand why they went to this film, it is scripted well and has the right level of emotion and poignancy to tell a story based on therapy and life following tragedy, a most watchable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!",Ordinary People
9,moonspinner55,Compelling if occasionally overwrought...,7,14 May 2006,"Robert Redford won the Best Director Oscar for helming this proficient melodrama about an upper-crust suburban family hit with tragedy: the eldest child, a golden boy, drowned in a freak boating accident, after which his younger brother (who survived the wreck) made a serious attempt at suicide after being overcome with feelings of guilt. Adaptation of Judith Guest's novel is heavy with overripe dialogue that portends to have the ring of truth. Redford seems determined not to let this scenario turn into a dirge, and so adds glimmers of humor, but occasionally he gets too colorful (as when Timothy Hutton, who wins a date with Elizabeth McGovern, smiles and sings ""Hallelujah!""--that's cute, but then he continues singing it until the joke loses its freshness). As the parents, Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore are less interesting than the younger players in the cast; Moore, working a convincingly immobile persona, has some of the weakest scenes, and her society maven doesn't end up making emotional or logical sense (particularly at the finish). Judd Hirsch plays one of the those touchy-feely movie psychiatrists who always wake up in the middle of the night for a crisis, though the majority of Hutton's scenes are bracing and natural, and perky McGovern has a sweetness that isn't forced. Handsome film is well-paced, yet it has confusing and/or anticlimactic passages, and the final scenes don't work. Hutton was also awarded an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and the film won as Best Picture. *** from ****",Ordinary People
10,blanche-2,a catharsis for the viewer,10,17 January 2005,"Some films evoke emotion from the watcher, but they can only be watched once. I'm not sure why that is - I know as much as I loved ""The Way We Were,"" I can't go through that pain again. ""Ordinary People"" is not that type of movie. It is one that people go back to, sometimes yearly, relive, and cry their faces off. I know I do. Maybe it's because we can relate to all of these characters so strongly.Beautifully directed by Robert Redford, this film is filled with brilliant performances. Mary Tyler Moore's stands out. The perfect woman, the perfect homemaker, the perfect socialite...on the face of it, that is. Moore's Beth is a woman who lost her capacity to love her younger son, or to connect, really, with anyone, because of his unforgivable sin. Though others commenting have mentioned some strong scenes, Hutton's coming to grips with his ""sin"" in Hirsch's office is the one that always leaves me breathless.This movie should be in the top 250. It's one of the best films ever made.",Ordinary People
11,Quinoa1984,Brilliant depcition of the American family,8,11 November 2000,Robert Redford's first directorial effort Ordinary People is one of the best films of 1980 and of the way a family works after tragedy.  It never looses it's feeling of deep emotion and that helps in making this film Redford's best.

Amazing drama that gets better every time.  A,Ordinary People
12,edwagreen,Ordinary People Certainly Not Plain People ***,8,30 December 2010,"No wonder Timothy Hutton won the best supporting Oscar for his role as the guilt ridden brother. He gave a phenomenal performance, and we can say that this was one patient who beat out fellow nominee, Judd Hirsch, his psychiatrist trying to get him not to have guilt feelings regarding the accidental drowning of his brother in a boating accident. Of course, it didn't help when a girl, who Hutton is starting to like, kills herself.Mary Tyler Moore, as the mother, is engaging. Her cold veneer comes through in a grand fashion. She cannot love, and husband Donald Sutherland, seems miscast as the husband, who has flashbacks what has happened.We're dealing with a WASP family. When grandma hears that Hutton is going to a psychiatrist, her first response is to say-""The therapist is Jewish of course!"" Moore readily agrees.Here is a family in crisis. Well directed by actor Robert Redford, who copped an Oscar along with the picture and Hutton. Moore, though good here, still has that voice of Mary Richards from the Mary Tyler Moore Show. Surprising that she never made many films after this one. Sissy Spacek beat her out for best actress that year in ""Coal Miner's Daughter."" Spacek was better.",Ordinary People
13,wes-connors,A Death in the Family,9,7 February 2010,"In Chicago, affluent Donald Sutherland (as Calvin ""Cal"" Jarrett), primly beautiful wife Mary Tyler Moore (as Beth Jarrett), and suicidal youngest son Timothy Hutton (as Conrad ""Con"" Jarrett) try to deal with grief following the accidental drowning of the family's beloved oldest son. Of these ""Ordinary People"", Mr. Hutton takes center stage. Most events revolve around Hutton's friends, emotional problems, and visits with cigarette smoking psychiatrist Judd Hirsch (as Tyrone Berger). Although he is clearly the lead actor, billing dictated he was a ""Supporting Actor"" - which helped Hutton scoop up awards in that category. Likewise outstanding, in a lesser role, Ms. Moore won fewer ""Best Actress"" trophies.Considering the competition, the film's ""Academy Award"" for ""Best Picture"" seems arguable; but, the ""New York Film Critics"" and ""National Board of Review"" agreed with Oscar that actor Robert Redford's directorial debut was the year's best. It is, absolutely, an excellent drama, and performed superbly - but, the dysfunctional family is not adequately explored, and emotional roots of the characters' situation never reach dramatic fruition. There was something wrong before (and/or besides) the death of beloved ""Buck"" - something centered around mother Moore, who seems, in hindsight, more emotionally disturbed than Hutton. Redford allows Moore to let you see it briefly, then shuts the door.********* Ordinary People (9/19/80) Robert Redford ~ Timothy Hutton, Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Judd Hirsch",Ordinary People
14,Doylenf,Redford's Oscar-winning turn as a first time director...,7,10 October 2006,"Relationships are explored in ORDINARY PEOPLE, after an unfortunate drowning accident has killed the older (and favorite) son of MARY TYLER MOORE and DONALD SUTHERLAND. The least favored son, TIMOTHY HUTTON, has survived the accident with a guilt complex that has to be treated by the family's psychiatrist JUDD HIRSCH.That's the main thrust of the story--and the film deals sensitively with the relationships between the mother, who pretends nothing is amiss and is rigidly in self-control but keeps herself aloof from nurturing her son, and the father who is much more forgiving in nature and extends himself to the boy with no visible effect.The boy's sense of guilt is conveyed in many different ways and is beautifully played by nineteen-year old Hutton, who won a Best Supporting Role Oscar for his work.It's the kind of relationship movie that Hollywood stopped making shortly after this and was more likely to be found in the Merchant-Ivory films that British and American audiences warmed to. It's a bittersweet tale that seems real and moving whenever these characters interact. Well worth watching and justifiably honored with a Best Picture Oscar for 1980.",Ordinary People

Conrad goes to see a psychiatrist (Judd Hirsch) to find out how--and if--he can deal with this.A multi-Oscar winner (Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor) this is a very quiet but emotional film. Director Robert Redford (his first film as a director) doesn't push things in your face or hit you over the head with screaming or yelling--he quietly lets the dialogue and acting explain the characters and situations.All the actors are in top-notch form--Moore is superb as Beth, the mother. Before this she was just known for doing comedy and being perky. Here she plays a repressed, emotionally unavailable woman--you can see her holding back and feel her breaking--just great. She was nominated for Best Actress and should have won. Sutherland is stunning as the father struggling to deal with his son and wife. Hutton is perfection--you can see the anger and guilt in his character. I was never too crazy about Hirsch in this movie--he comes across as way too cold and critical--still his scenes with Hutton are among the best in the movie.

Explores how one event can change the lives within a family, and the repercussions of those changes.Script is solid but it is Robert Redford's direction that makes the movie. The lingering, haunting looks, the perfect body language of the actors, the pacing. Despite being a movie with little ""action"", so to speak, mostly dialogue, there is no padding, or drifting. It is never boring, and always very enthralling.Great performances all round. Nobody puts a foot wrong. Timothy Hutton, in only his second cinema movie, got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, though he was arguably the lead actor in the movie. Mary Tyler Moore got a Best Actress nomination and Judd Hirsch a best Supporting Actor nomination, and both of these were well-deserved. Moore's performance was probably the standout in the movie, especially as she was predominantly a comedy actress.

Whereas Joker was an excellent movie I think it pales in comparison to Ordinary People and the issue of mental health.The main character, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), attempted suicide after the death of his brother Buck. It's more than obvious throughout the movie that he is not a happy kid. Almost as obvious is the awkward relationship between he and his mother played by Mary Tyler Moore.As a viewer you want this family to patch it all together, love each other, and live happily ever after, but it's clear it's going to take some heavy duty lifting by all of them. This movie highlights the difficulty of expressing and dealing with dark and abstract emotions. Even though it came out 17 years later I saw Good Will Hunting in this movie with the doctor patient relationship between Conrad and Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch).At times this movie is frustrating as you want Conrad to get out of the emotional rut he's in and at least smile. And at other times this movie is very moving. The performances by Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Timothy Hutton, and Judd Hirsch were wonderful.

18,evanston_dad,A Powerful and Dead-On Portrayal of Intense Family Dysfunction,9,5 December 2007,"A searing dysfunctional family drama that holds up very well today.Living on Chicago's north shore as I do, I can say with authority that this movie completely nails a certain kind of affluent north shore community that exists in Chicago suburbs like Lake Forest, Winnetka, Highland Park, etc., places where people erect hedges and fences not so much to keep people out as to keep family problems and secrets in. Director Robert Redford and writer Alvin Sargent clearly understand their subject matter. And in fact, this film so closely mirrors many of the personal circumstances of my wife and her family (my wife even established a productive relationship with a Jewish therapist who works out of Skokie, no less), that we joke that the film is really about her. Maybe it's my closeness to the subject matter that gives me my appreciation of the movie, but even without that I still think that I'd consider this film to be a superb drama, flawlessly acted.Speaking of the acting, Mary Tyler Moore, Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton were all recognized with Academy Award nominations (Hutton won) for their work in this film, all deservedly. Moore especially is memorable in her portrayal of a brittle power mom who must constantly hide behind a veneer of icy aloofness for fear that one tiny crack in her facade will send her crumbling to pieces. But two other actors deserve praise as well: Donald Sutherland, as a suffering father who's ill-equipped to deal with his family's problems yet whose heart is in the right place; and Elizabeth McGovern, who brings a sense of normalcy and healthiness into the film like a fresh breeze off Lake Michigan.There's a lot of talk about whether this film is better than ""Raging Bull,"" which came out the same year and lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""Ordinary People,"" which only goes to show how lame award competitions are when it comes to movies -- how can you possibly compare the two?

19,AlsExGal,An extraordinary film about people who are not ordinary,7,30 December 2018,"After the older of two sons dies in a boating accident, the younger son struggles with survivor's guilt and tries to kill himself. Mary Tyler Moore, as the mother, goes into a shell and cares more about keeping up appearances than nurturing her son and husband. All she cares about is her golf game, getting away on vacation, and making sure nobody knows the ""horrible"" secret of her son seeing a psychiatrist!Ordinary People is certainly a misnomer because these people are wealthy! They live in the wealthy suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. Vacation at the drop of a hat? Sure no problem. See a psychiatrist? Sure money is no object. Calvin the father turns out to be the true nurturer, and helps Conrad through his struggles and suicide attempt as Calvin realizes that he is on his own with trying to pull his son back from the brink and he will get no support from his wife .I just rewatched this one recently, and it hasn't aged well although I can't put a finger on exactly why that is. It still rings true on an emotional level and is probably one of the more unfairly forgotten of the Best Picture Oscar winners. If Mary Tyler Moore is embedded in your memory as sweet Mary Richards and Donald Sutherland is equally enshrined there as over-sexed surgeon Hawkeye Pierce, this film will correct that.",Ordinary People
20,HotToastyRag,Groundbreaking family drama,8,25 September 2017,"In 1980, Robert Redford proved to Hollywood he was more than just a pretty face by directing Ordinary People and winning the Best Director Oscar the following year. Really, though, did anyone think he was just a pretty face? By the time Ordinary People hit the theaters in September 1980, he'd starred in Neil Simon's most successful Broadway play, been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, won a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer, been nominated for an Emmy, won three Henrietta World Film Favorite Awards, won a BAFTA award for Best Actor, won a Western Heritage Award, been nominated for four Golden Laurels, and created a little contribution to independent cinema called the Sundance Film Festival.In Ordinary People, Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore are grieving over the death of their favored son. Timothy Hutton, the other son, has spent four months in a mental hospital after an attempted suicide. He's far from well-adjusted when he returns to his dysfunctional family environment, and the film follows everyone's grieving process and how they adjust to their new ""normal"". This is a very tense family drama, and a groundbreaking film at the time.Moore showed an incredible new side to her acting talents, since this role was so different from her television roles on The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. I've actually never seen her television work, so it's hard for me to imagine her as anything but a serious dramatic actress. If that sounds silly to you, watch this movie and you'll understand. Moore was nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars in 1981, and Hutton, who was only twenty years old, was and is the youngest actor to win Best Supporting Actor. I always say it's incredible to find child actors who are able to give a good, reliable performance, but it's equally incredible to see young adults who are terrific actors. Young children are used to taking orders from grown-ups, but young adults are at the age where they're starting to rebel from authority figures.

Timothy Hutton plays the troubled son who gets help from a therapist (Judd Hirsch) while Donald Sutherland & Mary Tyler Moore play the seemingly okay parents.""Ordinary People"" (1980) was Robert Redford's debut movie in the director's chair and it was a huge success. The story is two-pronged: It's a coming-of-age drama about the anxious son at home, school, therapy and his relationships with the fairer sex, as well as a marital drama about the parents.This was Hutton's first theatrical movie, but you wouldn't know that by his powerhouse performance, which is on the level of Brando. It's interesting how simple, realistic drama can be more compelling than some overblown ""blockbuster"" with an explosion every five minutes.Winsome Elizabeth McGovern is a highlight as one of the girls the son dates.On the negative side, the storm sequences are pretty artificial, reminiscent of a TV flick, and the story almost drowns in its unrelenting drama in the last act (I said ""almost"").The film runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was mostly shot in suburbs north of Chicago, e.g. Lake Forest and Highland Park.GRADE: B",Ordinary People

Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch all give outstanding performances (not to mention Redford's terrific direction), and this is one hard-hitting suburban family drama. Moore is a twisted marvel of repression as her household crumbles under a cheery veneer, Sutherland the desperate husband, and Hutton is just unbelievably tortured. His breakdown in Hirsch's office is utterly soul-crushing, and I was a blubbering mess by scene's end. I will never forget this scene.I'm 32 and I'm glad I waited until now to see this. I tend to wonder what my reaction would've been ten years ago (right place, right time?). But this is one hell of a movie - one of the best I've ever seen. It's a mind-boggling debut from Redford. Well-written, directed and extremely well-acted, ""Ordinary People"" is one emotional title fight. Jesus this is a hell of a movie. Just an extraordinarily well-made film. 9.5/10",Ordinary People
25,JamesHitchcock,Moving if Sombre Human Drama,8,4 February 2009,"There are a number of directors who have succeeded in making a masterpiece on their directorial debut; the examples who come to mind are Orson Welles (""Citizen Kane""), Sidney Lumet (""Twelve Angry Men""), Bryan Forbes (""Whistle Down the Wind""), Stuart Rosenberg (""Cool Hand Luke""), Kevin Costner (""Dances with Wolves"") and Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"").Like Costner, Robert Redford is better known as an actor than as a director, but he too had a remarkable success with the first film he directed, ""Ordinary People"", which won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1980. Like ""Kramer v Kramer"", which won the same award the previous year, it is a family drama. It is also remarkably conservative for an Oscar-winning film from such a late date. We tend to think of the late sixties and seventies as a revolutionary period in Hollywood history, a time of ground-breaking or experimental films such as ""The Godfather"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" or ""Apocalypse Now"". Redford himself had acted in some of those films, such as ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". ""Ordinary People"", however, harks back to the days before the cinematic revolution. It is made in what I think of as the ""filmed theatre"" style, concentrating more on dialogue than on physical action and with most of the action taking place indoors. Although it was based upon a novel rather than a stage play, it reminded me both in style and content of those Tennessee Williams adaptations such as ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", which were popular in the fifties and early sixties.The film tells the story of the Jarretts, an affluent Chicago family. As the film opens, Calvin and Beth Jarrett are trying to come to terms with the attempted suicide of their teenage son, Conrad. From Conrad's conversations with his parents, and his sessions with his psychiatrist Dr Berger, we learn that his suicide attempt was motivated by a sense of guilt stemming from his involvement in a sailing accident in which his elder brother Buck was killed. Even before the accident, Conrad suffered from feelings of inferiority towards Buck, who was a gifted scholar and athlete and clearly his parents' favourite. Beth, in particular, makes little secret of the fact that she preferred her older son. The tensions in the family eventually lead to the breakdown of Beth and Calvin's marriage, but Calvin and Conrad are able to reach out and forgive one another. The film has some similarities with ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", which also ends with a father-son reconciliation. In that film too the son has been troubled by guilt feelings stemming from a death, in that case the suicide of a close friend.Although this style of film-making may have seemed out of tune with the seventies Zeitgeist, there were occasionally some good examples from that decade, such as Robert Mulligan's ""Same Time, Next Year"" from 1978, and Redford here shows that the style has some solid virtues. It can be an excellent way of making films which concentrate on character, psychology or human relationships, which rely on good writing and acting rather than on spectacle, and Redford is here well served by his actors. The casting of Mary Tyler Moore as Beth was inspired. She was, of course, best known as an actress in television sit-coms, but her character here is essentially a sit-com character who suddenly finds herself in a serious drama. When tragedy hits her family, Beth goes on behaving as though she were the perfect all-American housewife and mother from a sit-com, retreating into a world of housework and charity to avoid having to confront her emotions. As Roger Ebert put it, Beth masks her inner sterility behind a facade of cheerful suburban perfection.I have to say that I did not agree with Timothy Hutton's Oscar for ""Best Supporting Actor"", because he was obviously playing a leading role rather than a supporting one, and was presumably nominated in this category so that he did not have to compete against the likes of Robert de Niro and John Hurt for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"". (Kate Winslet's recent ""Best Supporting Actress"" for her leading role in ""The Reader"" shows that this sort of manipulation is still going on). There was, however, nothing wrong with Hutton's performance, which is a fine and sensitive one, revealing the agony and grief which are destroying Conrad's life.I also liked Judd Hirsch as Dr Berger. Psychiatrists are often shown in the media either as godlike healers of the soul or as comic characters, funny little men with goatee beards, Germanic accents and an obsession with sex. Hirsch's portrayal gets away from both these stereotypes, showing Berger as an rounded human being, honest and caring but not flawless or omniscient. My favourite performance, however, came from Donald Sutherland as the agonised Calvin, desperately trying to cope with the disintegration of his family. Calvin is a flawed individual, but he has an inner strength and warmth which his wife lacks. I was very surprised that Sutherland was the only one of the four main actors who did not receive an Oscar nomination.""Ordinary People"" would not perhaps have been my choice for ""Best Picture"" of 1980; my vote would probably have gone to ""The Elephant Man"" or Polanski's ""Tess"". Nevertheless, it is a fine and moving, if often sombre, human drama, laying bare the tensions that can exist at the heart of even seemingly perfect families. 8/10",Ordinary People

27,Smells_Like_Cheese,I remember...,10,28 July 2005,"God, I read this book in high school. We also did watch the movie and I think the reason I forgot so much of the story was due the fact that I could relate very much at the time that I read this story, unfortunately. Also, it didn't help that I had to do over 2 dozen assignments on this book. :D ""Ordinary People"" is a wonderful drama movie. It's a story about a boy, who is dealing with the pain and guilt of loosing his brother to a boating accident, he has just come home from the hospital. He attempted suicide and now him and his upper class suburban family have to deal and live with all that they have lost.I remember analyzing the story and many agreed when we said we hated the mother. She shuts down emotionally and only wants to continue living life the way she wants to then to move on with her husband and son. Looking at this from a more adult perspective, I can honestly say that most audience members can relate. It's so hard trying to be strong and getting back to a normal life after so many tragedies. And Mary Tyler Moore really brought that out. She actually made me feel for her in some scenes.Donald Sutherland is an incredible actor. As the father, he seems at first as if he just is giving Conrad whatever he wants. He's in denial for most of the story but finally collapses at the end. When he confronts and deals with his pain, he gains so much more.Conrad, unfortunately I cannot remember the actor's name, he was also very true and honest about this role. Conrad has so much do deal with in this story: guilt, pain, and forgiveness. The actor was very talented and shows his meltdown. Both him and Mr. Berger together created some relief in the film.Weither I agree that this deserved ""Best Picture"" over ""Raging Bull"", I'm not sure about which should have won. I know many are arguing over it, remember that they are entirely different films. But, this is an actor's film while Raging Bull was more of an action in some ways. I wish there could have been a tie. :D ""Ordinary People"" is a very wonderful film that should be given more chances by people. It's very touching and moving picture about real people and real life.10/10",Ordinary People
28,blanbrn,Emotional and tough love family drama that proves the past can haunt you leading to change and departure.,8,1 February 2010,"1980's family drama ""Ordinary People"" directed by legendary Robert Redford is highly respected by many, yet displeasing to many others. I for one will not call it the best movie, still it's a memorable emotional family drama to be remembered. As watching this film it shows painful flashbacks and you will feel the heavy guilt ridden theme that the Conrad(Hutton)character faces.Anyhow it focuses on a well to do Chicago family who have been dealt a painful loss and the parents Calvin Jarrett(Donald Sutherland)and Beth Jarrett(Mary Tyler Moore)have tried to block out the memory of their lost son. On the other side other son Conrad(Timothy Hutton in a superb performance) feels all the guilt and responsibility as he feels it's his fought that his brother drowned. As this film flashbacks with painful memories for Conrad and it foreshadows with dreams of escape and romance for him. Along the way this both destroys and tightens his relationship with his parents as in an odd twist the mother Beth ends up leaving.Overall ""Ordinary People"" is a good emotional drama that proves just how the past can affect someone and shape their life. Oddly it proves life is complex and sad as many face an unexpected breaking away. Many may find this drama as to much of a sad feel I for one think it teaches emotional growth, unexpected ways, and departing change.",Ordinary People

30,sddavis63,Portrait Of A Family Falling Apart,8,2 November 2001,"Mary Tyler Moore (best known as the great wife and mom Laura Petrie from ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" and the single, happy career woman Mary Richards from ""the Mary Tyler Moore Show"") is the shining star of this movie about a family struggling to rebuild itself after the drowning death of an older son, and the attempted suicide of the younger son (played by Timothy Hutton), who can't escape the guilt of having survived the boating accident that killed his brother.Moore's very presence gives the impression that this will be, somehow, a ""feel-good"" movie; that, somehow, everything is going to work out in the end. It's just what we expect from Mary Tyler Moore. And casting her in the role of Beth Jarrett as the bereaved mom who loved her deceased son son so much that, with his death, she has no love to offer to either her husband or her remaining son, was the most brilliant decision of the movie. We expect things to work out for her. They have to. This is Mary Tyler Moore, for goodness' sake. But they don't. And we're left gasping at the end.
This is an emotionally heavy, draining movie. It is not for one of those days when you need a light piece of fluff to pass the time. Director Robert Redford does an admirable job of building the emotion slowly (perhaps at times a bit too slowly - my only real criticism) and drawing us into this portrait of a family falling apart. In addition to Moore, the cast is great. Timothy Hutton offers a powerful performance as the younger brother (Conrad) who survived the accident and who just can't move on. Judd Hirsch offers a solid performance in a somewhat limited role as the caring psychiatrist (Dr. Berger) trying to help Conrad carry on. Donald Sutherland struggled a bit as Conrad's dad (Cal) but still offered a decent enough performance. The only disappointment for me was Elizabeth McGovern as Conrad's potential girlfriend. She just didn't seem very natural to me in this role.There is a point near the end of the movie which sums the whole story up.**POSSIBLE SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD**Conrad, with the help of Dr. Berger, finally seems able to come to terms with the fact that his mom will never love him as much as he wants her to. In spite of her lack of affection for him, he is able to go up to her and give her a big hug. (I got worried for a moment. ""Oh no, they're going to spoil a great movie with a sappy ending."" But only for a moment.) As he hugs his mom, there is THE LOOK. Mary Tyler Moore offers THE LOOK! As she's being hugged by her son, Beth gets this look of absolute (how do you describe it?) shock, fear, even horror at the fact this this child, who had the nerve to survive when his older brother - her pet! - had died, has the nerve to actually hug her. Marvelous! Absolutely marvelous! There will be no happy mother-son reconciliation here. She can't stand being hugged by this boy. THE LOOK lasts perhaps three seconds, but it sums up the whole tragedy of this movie, and leads logically to the conclusion.It's emotionally draining, sometimes unpleasant, but quite brilliant really. Definitely watch it. 8/10",Ordinary People
31,ElMaruecan82,What we've got here is failure to communicate...,10,1 April 2012,"This last shot of Donald Sutherland's teary eyes while he just heard his son, played by Timothy Hutton, telling that he loves him, followed by an 'I love you, too' while they embrace is the emotional triumph of Robert Redford's directorial debut. No words can describe the impact of this conclusion, except maybe the melting of my heart in an ocean of tears as I could perfectly respond to the torment of Conrad Jarrett, the son, and his relationship with his father. Relationships this is the challenging theme of ""Ordinary People"", a psychological journey in an American suburban bourgeois family, mourning the precocious death of Bucky, the older son. Bucky was the pride of the Jarretts, the one that immediately reconciled everyone, Calvin, the father, Conrad, the brother and more than anyone, Beth, the mother and officious family leader, Mary Tyler Moore in an exceptional performance that probably deserves more regard if her figure wasn't too much associated with TV. With Bucky, it's the strongest link of the Family that went forever, and caused a series of disorders undermining the harmony that used to prevail. Harmony, God what a meaningless word when it comes to human relationships.The movie opens with the sight of a beautiful forest in an autumnal setting, it's one of these peaceful little towns, whose suburbs are occupied by the upper-class. Beth, the mother best exemplifies this universe with her constant obsession with order and social integration, as if everything in her life had to be planned and embody the same peace and harmony of the place she chose to live in. Socially, she's perfectly integrated, and with a husband as kind and understanding as Calvin, never was she contradicted. In a certain way, everything seems to point Conrad Jarrett as the true and only troublemaker, the one who committed suicide as a protest against his own failure to save his brother. As the movie progresses and the flashbacks give us more insights, we're plunged in the depths of Conrad's trauma and understand that he blamed himself for having survived the very incident that caused his brother's death.But the film takes its time to let us assemble the puzzle and this is the remarkable achievement of Redford, he's not just a talented director but an amazing storyteller. He doesn't use the core of the story, which is obviously Conrad's guilt, as the reason to be of the film, but on the contrary, to speak much more important statements about the failure to communicate within the Family circle. This failure is not meant to put the blame on someone, we're left with what we see, and no character seems to behave in the right or the wrong way. But as we get to know more about Beth, Conrad and Calvin, we understand that an evolution needs to be accomplished in a way or another. Hutton is sublime in his Oscar-winning performance as Conrad, the heart of the story, and far from the clichéd awkward teenager who slams the doors at his parents, he loves his parents, and he's aware of his behavior and tries to fix it by consulting a shrink, Judd Hirsch, Oscar-nominated as the Dr. Berger.Conrad's journey involves a sweet romance with a girl from his choir, Jannine (Elizabeth McGovern). Whether from Berger or Jannine, the therapy has a direction and it leads to the knowledge of the truth and the roots of guilt, meanwhile, the Jarretts couple takes a slowest evolution. It seems that Beth is still leading the show, but Calvin, inclined for more generosity and empathy, understands that there is a problem within his own marriage, a sort of sickness that made him follow his wife with a blindness that never questioned what was the place of every one in Beth's heart, apart from Bucky, who was naturally, the highlight of her life. The film beautifully portrays the irony of an adult couple too afraid to face responsibilities, with a woman in constant denial and a man afraid to ask the right questions. After visiting Dr. Berger, Calvin is asked about his relationship with Beth, he says that everything is all right, with a nervous smile. The next scene is pivotal in the evolution of Calvin, when he asks Beth why she was so careful about the way he would dress for Bucky's funerals.Ironically, the most immature and tormented character took his responsibilities and achieved his own catharsis, but the intelligence of the script and its extraordinary realism allow all the characters to face their responsibilities. In the heartbreaking climactic moment, Calvin finally opens his heart to Beth and delivers one of these monologues that make you wonder how Donald Sutherland didn't even get an Oscar nomination. After courageously admitting that he's not sure of his feelings anymore, Beth goes to bed, and has for the first time in all the film, a moment of weakness. Mary Tyler Moore sublimates the figure of a strong mother whose throne vacillates, she opens her mouth, she's about to cry, to shout, to breakdown, but she restrains and decides to leave. Incapable of changing, she voluntarily banishes herself from the house and leaves for a while, not as an antagonist, but as a victim of her own blindness. The two men stay outside and their exchange proves that they changed, and would start to face life with serenity, bravery, more confidence and less guilt. And this leads to one of the most beautiful conclusions ever shot in a film, and a tribute to those who consider the film didn't deserve to win the Best Picture award over the much more iconic ""Raging Bull"" or ""The Elephant Man"". I couldn't care less about these considerations after having seen the shattering and magnificent ""Ordinary People"".",Ordinary People

I mean, it's just about the ordinary lives of ordinary people, but perhaps that is why this film is so special. The characters are elevated by the actors who portray them and thanks to the acting, a very strong script, and the directing by Robert Redford, this film takes a look at the life of an ordinary family.In Robert Redford's directorial debut, this is about the Jarrett family and how the family disintegrated after the tragic loss of one of the sons in a boating accident.The acting is very, very good. A film like this needs good acting to save the audience from boredom. The acting made the characters interesting. Anyhow, Timothy Hutton was phenomenal as the younger son, Conrad who is contemplating suicide. Donald Sutherland is fantastic as the patriarch as the family and likewise can be said for Mary Tyler Moore, the cold mother of the family. Finally, Judd Hirsch was excellent as the psychiatrist who gets Conrad to open up to his feelings.Overall, Ordinary People is a monumental success because of how this character-driven story is. It's a realistic look on how a family can fall apart because of tragedy. As said before, this movie should have failed. But because of the talent this film has, it does not. This film is very somber, so be prepared to shed some tears. This is the film that defines the career of Robert Redford. This movie is that good. I rate this film 9/10.",Ordinary People

It is a very moving film as we follow a young boy struggling to coup with the loss of his older brother. It has some very hard hitting moments, and certainly does not beat around the bushes in terms of depression, the cast is all around impressive, the highlights certainly being Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore for me, who are both very convincing as a troubled couple who are trying to keep their son safe, while managing their own personal traumas. I did find the film to be very preachy on the subject of mental health, it was really shoving information on how to coup with it and maintaining a healthy one. There were times where the dialogue felt more like a theatre in education piece rather than two real humans having a proper, wholesome conversation. While it is one of the most vital parts of the movie, I found the scenes between Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch to be very poor. There was a complete lack of chemistry between them and Hirsch seemed very out of place in this therapist role. All of their sessions together seemed like Hutton was trying to give all he could, with Hirsch giving nothing back in return, he is a far better comedic actor. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I do not think it deserves the praise it has received, there are far better films with less Oscars. Not without its flaws, Ordinary People is still an impressive directorial debut from Robert Redford, I would recommend it if you are looking for a good drama, just do not go out of your way to see it.

35,secondtake,"Brilliant, perceptive, unforgiving, warm. A special film that still holds up beautifully.",9,21 September 2013,"Ordinary People (1980)I managed to go forty years without seeing this movie, and not because I was avoiding it. Now, as someone older than the protagonists, and as someone who grew up in that era of orange napkins and beige refrigerators, I'm very moved and astonished by it all. The writing is extremely subtle for a script filled with excessive situations. And the acting, especially by the main three people in the remainders of the central family, is really a marvel. Donald Sutherland is the father and his delicate handling of a man who is plumbing some difficult emotions is profound. He has to handle a wife who is crippled emotionally and a son who is just bursting out of a deep withdrawal. Timothy Hutton as the son is remarkable complex, and is a parallel in a way to Dustin Hoffman playing a dysfunctional kid in a dysfunctional family in ""The Graduate."" Mary Tyler Moore is the mother and is sharp, cool, yet likable, belying a deep emotional void. She is especially chilling and revealing because her public persona through television was as a really well-balanced, successful, single woman in a fast changing America.This isn't a happy movie at all, as you can tell, and yet it's a joy to watch. Not only is it finely made top to bottom, with wonderfully felt direction from Robert Redford (himself, like Moore, at the top of his acting career), it is weirdly warm, too. You like these flawed people (most of them) and you really want a beautiful resolution, as unlikely as it is. There might be some artifice to the flashbacks of the boat disaster, but maybe we can forgive that as the simplification of memory. Otherwise the sets and air and pace are spot on.It's nice to note there is no Hollywood ending here, not really, and that's a relief, too. A wonderful film with very few weaknesses.

Moore received much praise for taking on a role that's far removed from her sitcom success, but it's a performance without depth. It is not the actress's fault, but rather how poorly her character is written. It is hard to believe that a mother could be so cold towards her son, and her behavior is never explained.

The film does not seem like a TV melodrama either, with the quality of the acting, if nothing else, taking it to a high level. Donald Sutherland gives off one his career's best, most human performances, whilst Timothy Hutton shines as a youth who blames himself for others' problems but yet still contributes a lot of blame to his mother. Some of the scenes are really well edited too, and in fact there is little that jumps out as being a flaw in the film. Arguably, it touches on a psychological base a bit too much, and perhaps there is a bit too much maudlin music, but there is really little wrong with this film, which is perceptive, touching, and far off being ordinary.",Ordinary People

Brief Review -Depression is not an ordinary thing and so does this film.. Human lives are surrounded by many problems, some of them are serious, some of them are not, some of them are physical and some are mental. Depression is that one awkward issue which can shake your entire life just like that, yet you find it hard to express. Ordinary People is that extraordinary attempt to discover this not an ordinary issue from ordinary people's life. That makes it pretty Depressing film but all at the end is survived by finding peace after inner outburst. After accidental death of elder son, a family left with 3 people, a man, his wife and younger son, faces several issues connecting with each other. They end up finding the real reason behind it after a few midlife crisis. There's nothing like mannerisms in Ordinary People which takes it much away from fancy feature film category. Everything happens just like it should happen in real life so that the film feel like happening in real life and then only you could actually feel the depression to fire it in the climax. Ordinary People does just so correct in every department from writing, screenplay, acting, execution and direction. All 3 characters of the family are so relatable somehow, even if they look problematic to some extent but come on, that's how people are in real life. Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Timothy Hutton and even Judd Hirsch as the psychiatrist all do excellent jobs. Thanks to Robert Redford for keeping it real, neat and not dipping it into cinematic Liberty to spoil the real feeling of the film. Some films are meant to be life changing and not to be entertainer, well.. this is the film. If you ever feel mentally depressed just watch this film and it might just change direction of your life on positive side.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",Ordinary People
39,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Difficult yet honest psychiatric profile of the troubled suburban family,9,13 January 2010,"The way ""Ordinary People"" depicts the family is tough to swallow. Is the Jarrett family really ordinary? They suffered a horrible loss when their eldest son died in a boating accident and their youngest has recently come home after four months in the hospital because he tried to kill himself. These are not ""ordinary"" circumstances per say, but these are how once-ordinary people would handle such tragedy -- how any of us who can identify with feeling ordinary would handle such tragedy. That's the beauty of Alvin Sargent's script, Robert Redford's sensitive yet powerful direction and humbling performances from a terrific cast.I personally took to ""Ordinary People"" more quickly because it takes place and was filmed where I grew up in north-suburban Chicago. Although that personally brought it home more easily, there's something that everyone can connect with in this film. If nothing else, it addresses family intimacy, which every family has varying degrees of, and it will guaranteed make you think about that from a different perspective or maybe even awaken a greater need for that in your own life.The Jarretts, Calvin (Sutherland), Beth (Moore) and Conrad (Hutton) appear to be a very pleasant and agreeable family in the beginning, but look closer and you can see the tension. Family discussion is like a formality and Conrad and Beth in particular have a completely shattered relationship. All three actors master the script's subtext and create believable and complex characters and relationships. Their profiles are so comprehensive in fact that they can't easily be summarized.The focus is namely on the Oscar-winning debut of Hutton as Conrad. Hutton inherits one of the most psychologically complex film characters ever and he bottles it all in and somehow it manifests itself into this touching and fragile performance. Conrad has nightmares, he feels out of control, he's lost touch with his high school buddies and the swim team, he has romantic needs that he wants to explore, family troubles and he's harboring an incredible guilt. The sympathy he generates is immense, which is part of what makes the film so compelling.It might in fact be Judd Hirsch playing the psychiatrist, but the tension in Hutton's performance will turn every viewer into someone desperately wanting to help Conrad. In fact, Hirsch is a bit non-traditional as well, playing a more provoking and edgy shrink as opposed to a warm and sympathetic one, which makes us feel even more like the one person who wants to really listen and help Conrad and help him.There isn't really a dramatic plot arch to ""Ordinary People."" The basic idea is that Conrad starts seeing a psychiatrist and he comes closer and closer to confronting what he has to in order to truly overcome his troubles. The drama builds through increased conflict as more and more small events occur that push the characters, thus breaking the family's shaky but operational status-quo a bit at a time.Sargent's brilliant script is built around this natural rise in relationship tension. You can feel where the film is going to go from one scene to the next because the conflict causes obvious cracks that create logical next steps for the action to take. Part of this is also Redford's near- flawless transitioning. We're so clearly in the heads of these characters that each scene is so clearly the cause of the next and an effect of the last. He picks great moments to move from one to another and it keeps momentum going in a script without many dramatic events. There's only slight over-dramatic compensation in Redford's directing at times for this lack, but most of the time he's spot-on.But the enduring effect of ""Ordinary People"" on its audience is the portrayal of the family and its relationships. Each character has a psychological file folder that's overflowing and their interactions with each other are consequently so complex that you feel right away that this is the stuff of real relationships. No character sits permanently in a nut shell and more importantly is the realization that no one person is to be blamed or feel guilt for any one event. ""Ordinary People"" has such a firm grasp on the essence of family conflict and it shines through in an otherwise ordinary film.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Ordinary People
40,jzappa,"Even Since 1980, It's Not Regularly In Mainstream American Movies That We Get Characters Who Confront These Sorts of Trepidations.",9,13 January 2009,"Like a much more accessible Ingmar Bergman film, this simple, honestly titled film begins in a way I wish more films would, just as all of the chaos is falling apart. If you would imagine your life in a dramatic form like that of a movie, you would realize that the drama never really ends. Problems become history, people do as well, but old wounds open up, residual pain affects behavior in unsuspecting situations and characters are forever changed by what one would perceive as over according to classic linear film structure.This moving film's essential problems revolve almost apprehensively around the complications and density of love. It doesn't cerebrally analyze it all. It is almost nervous about the core of its subject matter. Two upper-class parents and their remaining teenage son all love each other, sure enough. But the father's love for the son is genuine though also tongue-tied, virtually reticent. The son's love for his mother is opposed by his certainty that she doesn't really love him, that she only loved his older brother, who was recently killed. And the love between the two parents is one of the most realistic loves I've seen in the movies of my recent memory, a long-time marriage which is one of those stable realities that both accept and presume and neither has ever really assessed or examined.This drama, Robert Redford's directorial debut, develops this triangular emotional standoff in the course of an autumn and winter. What I respect most about this melancholy family tragedy is that it truly does expand its characters and the transformations they experience. It shows them doing a very complicated element to accomplish in narrative, characters that change, understand, and intensify. They may augment, they may diminish.Integral to the transformation is the surviving son, a young Timothy Hutton, who won an Oscar for his performance. He is enormously suffering as this novel-based insight opens. He is dictated by worry and phobia, with no self-worth, and the accepted opinion that he is not loved by his mother. He starts going to psychiatrist Judd Hirsch. He condemns himself for his brother's death. He's something of an outsider at school on account of his suicide attempt. He does have a few friends, a girl he met at the hospital, and another girl who stands behind him at choir practice and who would, ordinarily, of course become his girlfriend.The instability concentrates on the mother, played by Mary Tyler Moore, superb casting for this specific character, in which the role veils her hidden barrenness behind an outward show of merry uptown aptness. She's magnificent at keeping her commercially ideal house in order. She's socially active, she's an operator, and so her impression is that she's a model family woman, apart from that to some deep-seated degree she is deficient in the fundamental maternal instinct of a woman. She's self-centered, she can't really give, and she has, indeed, always loved the dead older son more. Donald Sutherland is one of those fathers who wants to do and feel the right things, in his own clumsy manner. He goes through one of the saddest changes, becoming conscious that his wife cannot sincerely take care of others, he doubts his own love for her for the first time.Redford depicts a suburban environment with an unassuming understatement. There are no presumable implications against suburban lifestyles or material comfort or characteristics. The problems of the people we are shown aren't attributable to their scene, but breed from themselves. Furthermore, they learn they have no choice but to face them. That's what sets the film aside from the high-class soap operas of today in which melodrama is born out of cancelling a wedding or overeating or infidelity. Each character in this accomplishment is imparted the occasion to look within themselves, to doubt their own reasons in addition to the intentions of those around them, and to try to mend their own ways of coping with a difficult point in life, not spending a year flip-flopping on whether to forgive a cheating husband or sweating over a bridal gown. Two of the characters do realize how to change. We wish we could say the same about the third. Even since 1980, it's not regularly in mainstream American movies that we get characters who confront those sorts of trepidations, nor mainstream American directors on their first time at the helm who hunt for themand beat out Scorsese at the Oscars as a result!",Ordinary People
41,BeneCumb,"People not ordinary, rather from upper middle class",8,25 July 2012,"The film is from times when Academy Awards were given for natural problems and deep acting, not for fast actions and visual effects. The plot is quite depressive and not ""interesting"" in the modern sense of comprehension, but issues like mourning, alienation, selective love/care, perfunctory socialization etc are common in almost every family.All the major actors are great and Hutton deserved his Oscar for sure - I wonder only why his part was considered as supporting; he appears to be more on the screen than Sutherland and Tyler Moore as his parents.

If these are really supposed to be what we call ""ordinary"" people, then, boy, I'm tellin' ya, we are all in for a lot of really-really big trouble, folks! Yep. We sure are.Joyless, bleak, and hopeless, I found Ordinary People to be almost suffocating in nature. Its depiction of a grossly dysfunctional, upper middle-class, American family and how they dealt with feelings of guilt, and remorse, and their clear lack of love and respect for one another was almost more than I could stand.This film's depressing mood didn't seem to let up for even a minute. I felt as though director Robert Redford (golden boy) was literally bludgeoning me over the head, repeatedly, with a non-stop barrage of family misery and gloom that was delivered like brutal sledgehammer blows straight to the skull (thankfully they missed my heart).I can't believe that Ordinary People won out over Raging Bull as ""Best Picture"" at the 53rd Academy Awards presentation. I guess that depressing movies were all the rage back in 1980.In this film, TV comedienne, Mary Tyler Moore goes for a change of pace and plays Beth Jarrett, a miserable, grating, ""mother-from-hell"" figure who has some sort of demented obsession (which was never explained) over her now-dead, elder son. This woman (with a face-of-stone carved forever into a scowl) lashes out at everyone around her. (sheesh!)Then, on the other hand, there was Donald Sutherland (ho-hum!) as poppa, Calvin Jarrett, just doing another variation of his predictable, watery-eyed, ""Goofy"" character, assuring us all, once again, that his presence, as always, was easily forgettable.There was not a single ounce of cheer or joy in Ordinary People.

43,CubsandCulture,Strong screenplay anchors a moving domestic drama,10,18 January 2019,"A lot of people have trouble telling you the precise plot of this film. A lot of people think it is a coming of age story for Conrad and him dealing with his survivor's guilt. This is understandable as Hutton gives one of most tender, touching and vulnerable turns here. A lot of the film is devoted to his story and there is a special authentic quality to the therapist scenes. But actually the film is Calvin's story.Calvin, played wonderfully by a restrained and understated Sutherland, is a very reasonable and patient man who is trying his mightiest to reconcile his wife to their son. The screenplay does a masterful job, by beefing up the Conrad subplot, of preserving Cal's characterization while keeping the film's plot moving. The screenwriter had a remarkable touch to make such tiny things, like throwing away french toast, mean so much in context. There is a easy naturalism to much of the dialog that feels very true.Moore is saddled with a difficult character. Beth is so damaged and emotionally stunted that she could have come across as just an aloof and selfish woman. But Moore, especially in the quiet scenes with just Beth, does a enough to see the buried warmth underneath the icy surface.

The movie is among the most disturbing I've ever viewed and the performances, at least to me, are among the best. I can't imagine viewing this movie without feeling absolutely drained afterwards and I think I may have been a bit to young to fully appreciate it, but I can't imagine giving this anything but a 10, it was absolutely flawless in it's storytelling.I do think though, that a certain element of maturity is needed to view this, there are few I know who have not been touched or upset by the story and if one is to young or just not in the right mood to handle the heaviness(as I wasn't at the time),they may not be able to fully appreciate it.

50,onepotato2,Moore is remarkable,6,9 March 2008,"Mary Tyler Moore (Beth Jarrett) is the whole show here. She's a bad mother. The movie cuts her more slack than viewers do. Keep in mind, her numerous failings would have been positive qualities that the characters would readily describe as household benefits prior to the crisis point. She's provided a stable, amiable, clean home with pro-social values. The north shore of Chicago esteems these touch-me-not, unemotional qualities. But a crisis reveals that she's quite a chilly robot and can't share her emotions with those she's most intimate with. Beth knows it's forbidden to admit that she doesn't much care for her living son, but until she can be honest the entire family dynamic just becomes more and more maladaptive. Beth clearly, not only favored her dead son, but in one flashback seems to be enlivened by thoughts of a forbidden transgression, because Buck makes her feel youthful, popular and sexual. It's amazing that a TV comedienne would a) take such an unsympathetic role, and b) give such a refined, committed, chilly performance. There are two scenes in which the script wastes her, by forcing her to voice disappointing matters that come in out of left field (the golf course outburst, her defensive dinner with Sutherland). No one ever successfully nails her to the wall. It's too bad the movie doesn't offer a view into how she became who she is. She's a bit of a two-dimensional villain. A woman's second class role in society requires skillful navigation, or you're a bitch. The only similar character (and portrayal) I can name is Julianne Moore's preserved & desiccated housewife in Safe. And the only worse film-mother that comes to mind is Piper Laurie in Carrie.At least three characters are utterly frightened of what might happen if they fail to contain their powerful inner lives. And so they choose to front and suppress. Sutherlands sensitive man of the 70s thing is not good and and quite dated. He's eminently leave-able (in the end) because by the time depicted in the movie, he's a complete eunuch in the Jarrett home. The movie has amazing stuff in it, but ultimately is average because it blows its two major moments with less finely observed clichés. The late-night emotional outpouring with therapist Judd Hirsch is such emotionally cheap garbage, as is the final hackneyed conclusion in the backyard. That's too bad.",Ordinary People
51,JLRMovieReviews,"""Ordinary People"" is No Ordinary Film",10,9 March 2010,"I know there are probably tons of reviews for this outstanding film, but I would like to add this: Starring Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Judd Hirsch, and Timothy Hutton in an Oscar-winning performance, this is one movie not to be missed. Their life is shattered when Buck the oldest son is killed in a boating accident, with Hutton the only survivor.Robert Redford won an Oscar for directing it and giving a very straight-forward and honest take on real people, who really are far from ordinary. He brings us into their lives and makes a study of their motivations, thoughts, and dreams fascinating viewing. Despite its obvious tension and somewhat unsettling tone, there's something so cleansing and pure in its adaptation of Judith Guest's book. (Maybe it has to do with the fact the people involved go through therapy, too.)There was somewhat a to-do over the fact this won the Best Picture Oscar over ""Raging Bull."" But, while ""Raging Bull"" was about one larger-than-life person, this is about everyone and anyone. I have seen this many times, but not in a long while. So, when I recently saw it again, I was completely immersed in their world and couldn't get over just how good this movie really is. Alvin Sargent's Oscar-winning script has a lot to do with it, I'm sure. They all deserved the recognition they received.If you've never seen ""Ordinary People,"" do yourself a favor and see one of the best films of the 1980s, that is really a timeless story of us all.",Ordinary People
52,bandw,"Absorbing, intimate family drama",10,26 April 2009,"In a crisis you learn things about people, and about yourself, that you would not otherwise know. This movie illustrates that quite well. The Jarrett family (son Conrad, father Calvin, and mother Beth) live in an upscale neighborhood outside Chicago. We join the story six weeks after Conrad has been released from a mental hospital, where he stayed for four months after attempting suicide. Before the suicide attempt Conrad was an intelligent high school student who had friends, was on the swim team and in the glee club. Suicides, and suicide attempts, are often mysterious and it piques one's interest as to the motivations. Upon hearing such news the first question to come to mind is almost always ""Why?"" That is one of the hooks that keeps your interest in this movie--in a neat plot device we come to gradually understand the motivations behind Conrad's self-abnegating act only in parallel with his psychiatrist, Dr. Berger.The movie opens with a sequence of serene, melancholic images of the Jarrett neighborhood, with trees in fall colors. From that we segue into Conrad singing in the glee club with lyrics like, ""Free from all the world's desires free of all fear and anxiety"" sung to an arraignment of Pachelbel's Canon in D. We are shocked out of the reverie created by the opening scenes with a scene of Conrad in his bedroom being awakened in a cold sweat by a nightmare. Soon thereafter we get a brief flashback of a boating accident in a storm, presumably involving Conran. It is then that we realize that this film is going to have some complexities.In very short order we are thrown into the nitty-gritty of the Jarrett's family dynamics, which are difficult to say the least. We find out that Conrad's brother Buck was lost in the boating accident and that has precipitated a crisis in the family.Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) is the most difficult to understand and sympathize with. By the time we meet her she is obsessed with public appearances and the privacy of her family, at the expense of honest communication. She has a clear image of how things should be and rejects any evidence to the contrary. The complicating issue is that, in a flashback, we see that she was open and affectionate with her son Buck. Was Buck the only one who could break through her rigid conceptions of how things should be, or was it that he just fit into her world-view? Was the way she dealt with her son's death to retreat into an obsession with trying to control her world? Does she have deep emotions and is afraid to let them out, or is coolness and a desire only to skate on the surface a defining personality trait? You are inclined to believe the latter when Beth makes statements to her husband like, ""Don't try to change me. If I can't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do, then I'm sorry. I'm me, this is my family. If we have problems, then we'll solve those problems in the privacy of our own home."" Whatever the case, Mary Tyler Moore creates a striking characterization in her Oscar nominated performance. The hug that Conrad gives his mother toward the end has the be the most awkward ever recorded on film.Calvin (Donald Sutherland) means well but, until the crisis precipitated by his son's death forces him into it, he has never tried to piece together what is going on with his loved ones and how he can make a difference. He has never paid much attention to some fleeting concerns about Conrad. The crisis brings a lot of questions up for him and he struggles for answers. The crisis has changed him and watching the gradual changes brought on by his beginning to ask meaningful questions about himself and others is one of the delights of the film.Timothy Hutton is brilliant as the tortured Conrad. Seeing this performance by such a young actor almost makes you think that he could go on to be another James Dean--he truly shines in the most intense, dramatic scenes. Even though Hutton has had a good career, he has never achieved the status of superstar. Maybe that is not what he ever wanted, but he can be proud of this Oscar winning performance; he makes you care about Conrad as he works through his problems.Then there is Judd Hirsch as Dr. Berger. No Freudian stuff going on with him. No fancy office, no couch, no delving into early childhood complexes. Berger simply wants to address the problems at hand head-on. Would that we all had a Dr. Berger in our lives.Since this family could communicate only when repressed emotions boiled over, they were probably doomed from the moment of their tragedy. The film goes beyond the family in its analysis of the adverse effects of how social pressures restrain people from saying anything near the truth. When Calvin is asked at a party how Conran is doing, he says, ""Great, just great."" Only under extensive questioning by Dr. Berger can Conrad come clean. And Beth seems unable to say anything to her friends more than what she thinks will present a good image.You don't want to unload your problems on people at every opportunity, but this movie makes the case that being as closed down as the Jarretts has serious consequences.",Ordinary People
53,jacobs-greenwood,"Still packs a wallop, so be prepared to feel something (tissues recommended)",10,6 September 2017,"I'll admit upfront that I'm predisposed to loving this film's story because I identified with Timothy Hutton's character when the movie came out - when I was approximately his character's age - and subsequently, while raising my own children through high school. But watching it again earlier today - after not seeing it for more than a decade, I realized that it's one of those few perfectly made movies.It was director Robert Redford's debut, which shows just how much he learned while on the other side of the camera in the twenty-some movies he starred in before 1980; after all, he won the Oscar. It's also superbly edited and adeptly scored (with Pachelbel's Canon). But it's the acting that likely solidified its place as the Academy's Best Picture that year over Raging Bull (1980), a much less enduring feature. Its strength was Robert De Niro's tour-de-force, Best Actor performance. But, as a biography, it contains only one man's 'truth' whereas Ordinary People (1980) explores many of the universal truths inherent in family dysfunction, especially while trying to ""keep up appearances"", and parenting teenagers, among other themes.Donald Sutherland is excellent as the sensitive father trying to hold it all together, and 5-time Emmy winner Mary Tyler Moore rightly earned her only Oscar nomination as his repressed wife. If you're wondering, Sissy Spacek won for Coal Miner's Daughter (1980). But its Hutton - who won the Best Supporting Oscar - and Judd Hirsch (who was also nominated in that category) that deliver the most (of many) heart-wrenching scene(s) in the film. Even though I knew what was coming, I couldn't help but shake while crying over several minutes. In fact, if you don't tear up at least once while viewing this movie, you're probably repressed yourself. I haven't read Judith Guest's novel, but Alvin Sargent adapted it to win the film's fourth Academy Award. There's also excellent support from M. Emmet Walsh, Elizabeth McGovern (her debut), Dinah Manoff, and James Sikking (among others).If somehow you've yet to see it, I won't spoil it any further because the details of what happened to the family before the film's opening scene are teased out slowly, during the aftermath of the present.

I've known many folks who, like myself, have gone through the grieving process, and it's well known that everyone has to work their way through this time of sorrow in their own way and at their own pace. But, never have I seen anyone who acted in the perverse manner that these supposedly ""ordinary"" people act. They are the sick products of the scriptwriter's nightmarish imagination.This movie feigns cerebral and emotional substance, but is merely a gross distortion of both of these elements. Every Mom who ever tragically lost a son is portrayed here as vile and despicable vermin, and deserves an apology from the writer for this detestable depiction. Mary Tyler Moore plays a grating and miserable character that is too contrived to either be hated or empathized with. She plods through the whole thing, lashing out at everyone around her, especially her mellow husband and over-emoting younger son. Evidently, she had some sick obsession with her late elder son, and his death has driven her to the point of madness. Watching Moore with that pasted on scowl and blank, drunken stare for 90 minutes or however long this movie was (it felt like a year) will drive you to the point of madness as well.The story goes nowhere, and revolves around in circles like a dog chasing its own tail. It desperately tries to strain sentiment from its family-in-crisis motif as if it were trying to squeeze blood from a tomato. The characters never change or resolve anything; they just continue to hate each other and yell and scream and fight until the credits finally and mercifully roll. Some 80's psycho-babble gibberish is tossed in, and is just as pointless as everything else the movie assaults you with.The same footage of the drowning death is run over and over until you want to drown all the characters just to shut them up. After several rehashes, it becomes increasingly apparent this scene was filmed in somebody's back yard pool. The waves created by the fans go in different directions. The hand of the guy who's ""going down"" stays in one level spot as if the actor was hiding just below the surface of shallow water sticking his hand out. The reflections of the film crew's lamps are clearly visible, even shining blinding light directly into your face at times.Very depressing, tedious, poorly executed, and not entertaining at all.

It takes an incredible ability to convey all of this, but Mary does it and I am left to wonder why she did not assume more dramatic roles. Perhaps it was too draining in that this part reflected so much of her own personal tragedies.

56,classicalsteve,Masterpiece of American Drama,10,6 June 2007,"The opening shots are the peaceful but misty waters of Lake Michigan. Why is the lake the first shot? Eventually the scenes change to the sleepy suburban area off the coast of Lake Michigan in Lake Forest, Illinois. The town is very reminiscent of small communities in New England, with the beautiful golden leaves of Fall layering the roads and the gardens. Finally the camera rests upon a high school choir singing a transcribed rendition of Pachabel's Canon. The camera pans the many high school students contributing their sound to the musical collective. This will be a story about a certain high school student among these singers. Finally the camera rests on Conrad Jarrett played by Timothy Hutton. He is an ordinary person of high school age, or is he? In the next shot, he is jumping from sleep in a cold sweat as if from a nightmare. Something is amiss...Next we meet his parents, Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore in not only the role of her career but a tour De force Oscar-caliber performance, and her husband, Calvin Jarrett, played by Donald Sutherland in probably his finest performance. At first they seem to be a contented happy middle-aged couple on the upper-crust of society. They go on many vacations during the holidays, they have the finest clothes, they go to expensive restaurants and plays, and they hop-nob with the social elite of the community. Calvin is a tax attorney making very good money, enough to afford his stay-at-home wife who keeps their house neat and orderly akin to Martha Stewart. When she's not placing expensive napkins on the dinner table, she is either shopping or playing golf. All seems well. Or is it? Their only son, Conrad, is having trouble sleeping and eating. He's aloof with his friends at school, sometimes not looking at them when they are talking to him. And his mother acts, well, strangely toward him--not quite a healthy and nurturing mother-son relationship. As the story gradually unfolds we gather pieces about this family and find that not everything is as it seems. One of the most brilliant aspects of this film is its pacing. Pieces of back-story are brought gradually to the forefront. Each piece of the larger mosaic, one that is much greater than the time-frame of the actual story, comes to light only with great effort. There is a sense that the characters are purposefully engaged in hiding the larger back-story away like skeletons in the closet. When Conrad undertakes to see the psychiatrist Dr Berger, he claims that family, school, aka everything is ""fine"" to which Berger replies ""Then why are you here?"" The two things we begin to gradually understand is that Conrad was not the only son but he had an older brother now deceased. We also learn that Conrad had been in the hospital because of an attempted suicide. But these raise more questions than they answer. For one thing, with all this back story, why does the story take place at this time and place? Why did Conrad attempt suicide? How did his brother die? The answers lie somewhere within the waters of Lake Michigan...This story may not only be about what happens to its characters, and the crises they ultimately must face. On one level, the story is a commentary on the false perception of ""ordinary"" or ""normal"" people. Particularly in America, we often have a false perception of the ""norm"". People raise families, bare children, see them off to college, etc, etc. With these larger generalities we often miss the struggles, the disappointments, the trauma, and even the tragedy that many experience, but often regarded as not happening to ""normal"" or ""ordinary"" people. Ironically, the character of Beth wants to give off the false but ""nice"" veneer of normalcy. At one point, she rages at Calvin for revealing at a social event that their son has started to see a psychiatrist. Beth sees friends at shopping malls and at parties, but she could not bare to have any of her fellow socialites know about any of the things that are really going on. And even when she is confronted by her husband to deal with their issues, she wants to go on vacation rather than the face the realities around her.In many ways, ""Ordinary People"" is about secrets. The upper-crust of American society has a tendency to keep things shut within large 2-story houses with manicured lawns in front. Many have felt that if they revealed their dark secrets they would be judged as being ""abnormal"" by their peers. In many ways, the tragic message is that many others have these same problems and secrets, but they do not understand that revealing them to others could help the healing process. Ordinary people are not ordinary people, in other words, but we do not yet know this. A philosophical book once said, ""There are no such things as ordinary moments.""",Ordinary People
57,ODDBear,Stunning cinematic achievement,10,25 August 2003,"Ordinary People is in every way a stunning cinematic achievement.For his directorial debut, Robert Redford chose the Judith Guest novel concerning the inner goings and emotional struggle of an ordinary financially well off family.Incredibly emotional in it's simplicity, whether in dealing with Hutton's ineffectual relationship with his mother, the father's struggle to get beneath the surface of their problems or Hutton's relationship with his doctor. Never overblown or high strung dramatically speaking, everything is toned down and therefore giving us a more real look at a family torn apart.What makes all the difference here are the exceptionally well written and defined characters and the acting performances. Hutton is simply sensational as the son who's guilt ridden about his brother's death and attempts to take his own life. So powerful, yet very subdued, one of the few acting bits that make me sense how bad he's feeling at times. No less impressive is Mary Tyler Moore as the aloof mother. Brilliantly portraying a multi layered character, a woman who quite simply dies in a big way along with her older son, all the love and affection she had for him, and for everything else around her, went with her son to the grave. Donald Sutherland and Judd Hirsh are also superb in their roles.What's magical about this movie for me is that every time I watch it I seem to get to know the characters better each time. I remember seeing Moore's character as being nearly a bad one, but as I get older (and hopefully wiser) I understand her a lot better, and she deserves sympathy rather than resentment. It's like that with all three characters, like most people we know in our own lives you have to get beneath the surface to really know them, and this movie accomplishes that in my opinion.My absolute favorite movie. 10 out of 10. A 100 out of a 100.",Ordinary People
58,gab-14712,A Character-Driven Piece About Grief!,9,9 November 2017,"1980's Ordinary People is a masterpiece. The story is about how grief can impact and tear apart a family, so this film is a very hard watch and it will most likely leave the viewer in an emotional state. That being said, this film is powerful because of the themes the movie tackles and because of four heartfelt, emotionally-driven acting performances.Tragedy is something every family deals with. Someone dies, thus turning the world into pieces for families. Many families also have underlying problems that they choose to ignore or they cannot see, but are forced to confront these problems when tragedy strikes as it occurs with this one particular family, the Jarrett family. That is the whole essence of this movie, how these very real characters confront their issues.By 1980, Robert Redford was a full-fledged movie star. He was in such movies like Bonnie and Clyde and The Sting. The time was ripe for Redford to make his directorial debut. I am always hesitant about actors becoming directors, but Redford shows right away that he knows how to direct and bring the best out of his actors. You generally won't get a better directorial debut than what Redford did with this film. He was so good, he deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Director.Based on a book by Judith Guest, this story tackles what it's like to deal with grief. Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), Calvin (Donald Sutherland), and their son Conrad (Timothy Hutton) are grieving after the other son was tragically killed. Conrad is overcome with guilt because he feels like it is his fault his brother was killed, and he is prone to suicide attempts. In order to deal with his grief, he sees a therapist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch). Beth feels indifferent towards Conrad because she preferred his brother more, so it is up to Calvin to try and hold what is left of the family together.This is one of the movies need to be shown in film classes when it comes to acting because every single actor brought their A-game. They really make you believe that these actors are just ordinary people, instead of well-received actors. Mary Tyler Moore, known for her work with The Mary Tyler Show, is perfectly cast. She does a great job masking her feelings behind her suburban, homebody facade. She plays the Betty Crocker type well, but you see the selfishness of her character because of her preference with her older deceased son. Timothy Hutton makes his film debut here and ended up winning an Oscar for his moving portrayal of Conrad. His character is tortured, is filled to the brim with grief and guilt, and is an outcast at school because of his suicide attempt (although he has two ""girlfriends"" to help him). I liked the Judd Hirsch character, Dr. Berger because of his optimistic views. His portrayal as a psychologist is one of the very few portrayals that showed the profession in a positive light at the time. Finally, Donald Sutherland delivers another winning performance as Calvin. Calvin wants to do and feel the right things, but does so in an awkward manner. Out of all the characters, his character took the saddest turn of the movie because after a lengthy marriage with this wife, he begins to question their love for the first time.Ordinary People is no easy watch. The film starts with an emotional standoff between the three Jarrett family members, and it gets more emotional from there. Alvin Sargent's script, which he adapted so well, tackled the ideas of what it means to love and how grief affects people. Each character is given a purpose in the film, and the chance to question their motives and the motives of others. It's also a movie about change and how it can affect you for the better or for the worst. The acting is a tour-de-force and one of the better acting ensembles of 1980. Robert Redford created a movie that is slow-paced, but emotional, perceptive, and very intelligent. This film is not about actors, but about ordinary people.My Grade: A-",Ordinary People
59,rzajac,"Heartbreaking, hopeful",8,23 February 2003,"I was deeply touched by this movie.  I was also stimulated by the incredibly fine writing, acting, directing, editing....everything.One thing of note; This movie would appear to be part of a long line of public service messages for the psychiatric profession, including ""The Seventh Veil"" and ""Good Will Hunting"".  Amazingly, profoundly, the film suffers not a whit for being a benign shill for the view that we could all use a little time on the couch.Were it not for its naturalness, the pacing of this movie could be said to be textbook.  I was on the edge of my seat, waiting for the secret at the heart of the opening family interactions.  This was unfolded in good time, in an appropriate and eye-widening manner.  Compare this masterful writing, directing, and editing with the fumbling attempts to achieve the same effect in Shyamalan's ""Signs"", which also opens with strangely affected family interaction scenes.  You wait for resolution, and it never really comes--not to the satisfaction of this eager and expectant viewer.  ""Ordinary People"" shows that it *can* be done, and done right.  No excuses are acceptable.It's funny to think of, but perhaps ""Ordinary People"" is what psychological thrillers are *supposed* to be.  Which, insofar as my characterization is correct, makes it a sort of tour de force.  Can someone name some other movies that achieve the same thing?  I'll be sure to rent and watch them!",Ordinary People

Mary Tyler Moore, the mother, does not understand that Conrad needs her. She does not want to change. This film changed the necessity of pretending that everything is fine.

61,jpschapira,Redford's first step of the way,8,22 October 2005,"The industry loves Robert Redford; they really do and they've always have. So when he directed his first feature, he had to be in the spotlight. It's not like he wanted to, but it was a matter of fate. Maybe Scorsese's fans still feel disappointed today and maybe this is isn't the greatest film in history, but it is at least a proof to show Redford was a gifted director from the beginning and that he chose a very strong and interesting topic for his first piece: Ordinary People.The fact that the characters of the film are so palpable and human makes me think. And it's not the first time with this movie; today, each time I catch a movie about real daily lives, I pay attention to all the elements: I want it to be real, because those are the films I like more. When this picture commences, you can perfectly listen to a Canon. It is not original music, but even when there's a composer, music is what this movie uses less. The opening credits are also seen with the sky as a background, quickly, desperate for the movie to start. The passion for making films can be felt.Now the story is being told, in the words of Alvin Sargent, screenwriter who based his thing in a novel by Judith Guest, and his adaptation is remarkable, because the tension can be felt, the chats don't seem fakes. There's no intention of complexity or poetry in some words, but that's exactly what had to be done. I was eagerly thinking, although, in today's screenplays of these type. Cameron Crowe and his natural way to say things; Paul Thomas Anderson, when he does not try to be Shakespeare.Good or not (very good for me) the story tries to show us what this family lives, with no special intentions. It could have been any other, and this one sadly has very important issues to carry with. When Conrad's (Timothy Hutton) brother die, he felt guilty, but he just doesn't say it. He knows that, and he also knows he is violent, boring and a little dangerous. He begs for control and the one who'll help him is Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), during sessions of very well written talks. Sargent analyzes this relationship and the one Con has with Jeannine and other people comparing each word, each position, with cameras and settings.And it doesn't work only with Conrad; it works with the other main characters. Calvin Jarrett's (Donald Sutherland; a fine performance but not as strong as the others) life involves friends reunions and encounters, his relationship with his younger son and the memory of the elder's dead, and the most powerful element maybe of the whole film, his relationship with his wife Beth (Mary Tyler Moore); who also has to deal with her brother, her now only son and everyone in the society.The screenplay doesn't miss a thing, and hits hard when Beth tries to talk with Conrad outside, or when he tells her his good grade in a test, or the disturbing moment when Cal wants to take a picture of his wife and son together, and she refuses to stand still, asking for the camera. She can't hug her son for the photograph, her smile is faked. With a lot of noise and movement that keep Cal from taking the picture, Conrad suddenly shouts: ""Give her the f***in' camera!"". Then there's a family discussion about family caring: ""She never went to the hospital to visit, because she was in her trips to Europe"", Conrad tells his father referring to Beth. ""But if Buck had been there, you would have visited, right?"". So Conrad goes quickly upstairs, but not quickly enough to miss his mother's scream: ""Buck would never have been in the hospital!"". Because Calvin cares for everyone, but Beth fears that people finds out his son sees a psychiatristSee the difference?Performances are key to the movie's success, and although Mary Tyler Moore carries the thing, the supporting portrayals highlight the most. Timothy Hutton trapped focused driven representation of a screwed up kid is wonderful; you can tell he's trying to improve. However, it is Judd Hirsch as the understanding psychiatrist the one who makes the best out of the screenplay for me. He says everything fast, in the same tone of voice, like he didn't care; and that seems easy. But when the strength is required, he accomplishes magically.Redford's camera is the other main character I didn't mention. His first film already had elements he'd repeat later in his few directed movies. The golf this family played would be the central theme of the astonishing ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"". The ones who doubted of his directing talent should also see the perfectly crafted ""Quiz Show"". Besides directing the actors perfectly, because he is an actor, he makes the camera the important element not many care about. So he places still shots, so the camera can wait for the characters and watch them do their lifeIn conversations between two persons, he just shoots the face of each of them when they are speaking, he is studying the characters. Characters and lifeTwo words instantly related.A lot of things happen in Redford's debut, including a conversation I feel tempted to reveal, but even if I spoke, it would be up to you. It would be up to you to decide what each of the characters think, what they've buried, what they feel, and most importantly; why",Ordinary People
62,RonellSowes,A powerful and eloquent film,8,1 December 2020,"Many actors have turned to directing films, most of them aren't very good at it but Robert Redford certainly is. Ordinary People was his directorial debut and garnered him a Best Director and Best Picture Academy Award-deservingly so. Redford creates the perfect tone for the film displaying the emotions of the characters not just through their words but in the atmosphere of each scene. When making a film with a sentimental feel it's extremely easy to go overboard and drown it in its emotion but Redford balances it all perfectly.
Timothy Hutton gives a profound performance as the troubled,guilt ridden teen for which he won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor beating out Judd Hirsch who is equally terrific. Mary Tyler Moore was also nominated for her performance as a very cold and contemptible character,a far cry from her usual persona as a happy,warm person. While he wasn't recognized by the Academy Donald Sutherland is very natural in his role and gives the best performance of his career.The film is powerful,eloquent and the gold standard of family dramas. It's a film about the problems ordinary people face and how they deal with them.",Ordinary People
63,jdkraus,"An intense emotional drama made up of a witty script, brilliant performances, and great direction by Robert Redford",9,22 September 2008,"The main reason why I rented this movie was because I wanted to see whether it was better than its two big Best Picture nominees in 1980 ""Raging Bull"" and ""The Elephant Man"". After seeing, I can understand why it was the Best Picture winner. To describe ""Ordinary People"" in a phrase, it is an intense emotional drama of a family torn by tragedy.I love all the actors' performances in this movie. They each made a character of their own. Mary Tyler Moore is detached as the mother Beth Jarrett, who can't stand her suicidal and depressed son Conrad (Timothy Hutton). Conrad sees a psychiatrist (Judd Hirsch) by his father's suggestion (Donald Sutherland) who tries to keep the family together. The one of several things that blew me away about this movie is Hutton's performance. He isn't theatrical or rehearsed in his role as a troubled teen. Rather, he becomes his character. He did so well that I can sympathize and relate to him (as a person myself who has gone through a rough time in my teen years). His Oscar was well-deserved though I still wonder why he was considered supporting instead of the lead (since he was in most of the movie). Donald Sutherland, an actor who I don't care much for, delivers an extremely grand performance as a father who is willing to do anything to help his son and wife. I'm surprised he didn't get an Oscar nom. Judd Hirsch is not in the movie a whole lot, but every second he is in it, he delivers fluent lines of wisdom and humor to the troubled Conrad. Robert Redford's direction captures the film brilliantly, pulling you into the drama and characters' feelings. His Oscar was well earned. ""Ordinary People"" is an emotional drama delivered by a witty script and brilliant performances in which many people living the American dream can relate to. However, it is a very depressing movie since its topics are on: suicide, tragedy, loss, depression etc. It's not a movie for everyone but it is great nonetheless. I will be honest though, I still like ""the Elephant Man"" more.",Ordinary People
64,TheOtherFool,Hallelujah,10,5 September 2004,"Consider the beginning for Lynch's 'Blue Velvet': we are in the midst of a picket fenced, clean cut community... but somethings wrong... What lies beneath the surface?Well, it's the same thing with the (earlier made) Ordinary People. We see trees, a peaceful ocean, Pachelbel in the back and some youngsters singing Hallelujah on the chords. But then, this one guy with a bit of a red face stands out...It's Conrad (Timothy Hutton), an intelligent and athletic guy who's living with his parents Calvin (Donald Sutherland) and Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) in a huge house in what seems to be a nice community. But, as in Lynch, something is wrong. We know it, we feel it.Compare this to what I feel is the Ordinary People of nowadays: American Beauty. It starts off with a beautiful lane, but right there and then Lester Burnham fills us in: he's gonna die within the next year. Ordinary People isn't as clear or cynical as that, but I see that as a good thing.Back to the story then. The burden the family is carrying is that of the death of the oldest son, Buck, a pricewinning, popular and beloved guy. Conrad blames himself for the death of his brother, and has tried to kill himself out of guilt. When the movie starts he decides to see a shrink for it, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch).The movie tells the remarkable and emotional tale of how to keep a family together that can't be held together, how to deal with death, how to rejoice again, how to love... Director Redford and all the actors (with Oscar-winning Hutton as a standout) do this so well, I feel not ashamed admitting I cried a couple of times during the movie. I cannot recall any movie that ended with the words: 'I love you.' 'I love you too...' where that just seemed about right and honest. Oh that ending... you try and keep it dry!I cannot praise or recommend this movie enough. To speak with Melvin Udall: this must be as good as it gets...10/10.",Ordinary People

But the award went to Ordinary people. I strongly believed it deserved it. Raging bull, as great as it was, was nothing compared to Ordinary people. Based on the novel by Judith Greist, Ordinary people revolves around a teen named Conrad(played by Oscar winner Timothy Hutton in his first film), who is traumatized by the death of his brother. His parents(played spectacularly by Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore) aren't as traumatized, and this causes problems.This is a very powerful film. The performances from everyone are wonderful. The film, at times, is very funny. And the story is just wonderful. The performances, among other great things, are what also brings this film together. Ordinary people is one of my favorite films. I strongly believe that it deserved best picture. A lot of things make this movie great. Even it's score from Marvin Hamlisch(The Sting) is wonderful, and just every single thing about this movie is wonderful. Who'd of thought Robert Redford could direct such a spectacular movie?

You see, in my family we had an attempted suicide too. Only in my family it was the father who cracked up. And I was the teenage son who had to deal with it.I didn't have the luxury of visiting a shrink every day after school and letting all my feelings out. The day after it happened I walked to school like nothing was wrong. And that was fine with my parents. In my house we kept everything covered up. We didn't share our feelings with strangers. And we didn't live in a million dollar mansion in an idyllic suburb. And my mother wasn't quiet, well-dressed and decorative, like Mary Tyler Moor.My mother was loud, angry, and Jewish. When I was a kid she smacked me around all the time, over nothing. Over stuff like watching Hogan's Heroes on TV. And when my dad tried to kill himself her big suggestion was that I should make him dinner for a change. She didn't suggest that I talk to a school counselor. Or the principal. Or anyone. My mental state was not a big concern. No, she was too concerned about who was going to make dinner when my dad got out of the hospital. Of course she had just moved out of the house the year before. Because the rats always abandon the sinking ship!But there I was, at eighteen, with nobody to talk to, trying to make chili for my dad. I needed help. And I needed someone to talk to.

The film is done very well by Robert Redford. A classic drama from the early 80s. I liked the simplicty in Redford's approach, letting the characters get through to the audience. This film has some great lessons as well as good performances, and had the potential to be very over-the-top and annoying but it wasn't. It was actually pretty realistic and done well.

68,Movie-12,"Beautiful script, characters, and flawless filmmaking. A movie not to forget. **** (out of four)",10,29 May 2001,"As an aspiring screenwriter myself, I envy Alvin Sargent, the mastermind behind the script of the Academy Award winning 1980 drama ""Ordinary People."" Based on the equally as heartbreaking novel by Judith Guest, ""Ordinary People"" flawlessly captures all aspects of great cinema. The scenes have the perfect timing; the performances are vividly descriptive and entirely convincing; the direction is efficacious and focused. The filmmaker's never pretend that this movie is easy to watch, but they sure do produce an emotional and mental response from the viewer. ""Ordinary People"" launched Timothy Hutton's career, rewarding him with an Oscar. It's too bad his career as an actor seems to be traveling downhill. Although his award was for best actor in a supporting role, he is truly the center of the movie. Hutton plays Conrad Jarrett, the son of Calvin (Donald Sutherland) and Beth (Mary Tyler Moore). The Jarretts are recovering over various recent disasters. They lost their first born son to an accident, for which Conrad blames himself. His grief eventually provokes a failed suicide attempt. As the movie opens, we meet the family. We never witness Conrad's suicide attempt, the preceding family death, nor do we see anything than happens during his hospital stay. ""Ordinary People"" knows exactly where to start and what to show. It leaves a great deal to our imagination. It gives us freedom to put ourselves in the character's shoes. This is a realistic portrayal of a crippled family trying to mend with problems. Several key characters also contribute to the rehabilitation of Conrad. Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), provides Conrad with psychological guidance; the high school swimming coach (E. Emmet Walsh) understands Conrad's condition, but still doesn't want the swim team to lose his talent; Jeannine (Elizabeth McGovern) befriends the struggling Conrad; Karen (Dinah Manoff) another similarly hospitalized with Conrad, gives him some added confidence.
""Ordinary People"" took home Academy Awards for best picture, director, supporting actor, adapted screenplay, Mary Tyler Moore's deserving performance, and earned various other nominations, including the supporting performance by Judd Hirsch. It is clear why the film won so much praise by critics and audiences alike: we can clearly identify with the characters and their situation.The characters are beautifully written. I cannot remember the last movie I saw that so vividly captures individual lifestyles and personal tragedies. Every character plays an important role in Conrad's life. His father feels his son's suicide attempt is due to his poor parenting. The materialistic mom finds it difficult to contend with difficulties and to forgive her son for what he did to her public image. Conrad's problems evolve into larger, more complex issues of love, compassion, forgiveness, and our personal differences. The actors really deserve the crown here. If there was even one who did not live up to the great expectations, they would appear obvious and subtract from the film's emotional grasp. Timothy Hutton really portrays his character well. Every emotional aspect feels real, justified, and understood. Mary Tyler Moore portrays the film's potential villain believably as well. She makes is obvious that Beth would rather run from problems instead of dealing with them. After seeing Donald Sutherland in many recent film's that seem rather terse, I formed opinions about his credibility and ability that his performance here proves wrong. He is definitely a gifted actor when dealt good material. In this performance, easily the best of his career, he captures every minuet detail of a father struggling with his past, present, and future. ""Ordinary People"" shares much in common with 1999's best picture winner, ""American Beauty."" That was another great film, but ""Ordinary People"" contains debatably better material. ""American Beauty"" looked tragedy in the eye and found respect, mockery, and grace. ""Ordinary People"" never bestows comic material, however, but it does trace suffering to its root, and finds disorientation, embarrassment, and sorrow.  This is not an easy movie to watch, but a challenging, perceptive, tragic story that you are not likely to forget.",Ordinary People
69,sashank_kini-1,Quintessential Modern Tragedy,10,1 February 2012,"The greatest difficulty in life is to conquer your inner demons; generally humans prefer to veil themselves behind a facade and assume their masks to be their true identity. I do not blame most people for doing so – it is extremely painful to face yourself, because the world will continue to move at its pace. Conrad Jarrett finds tranquility behind the white walls of the hospital. People listened to his problems – they were paid to do so. The outside world does not really bother about him, and he knows the world isn't at fault. Conrad has to face his fears, and though a psychologist does guide him, he himself has to find the answers. When he is in such a dilemma, he cares not for anybody. He wonders how shallow people are around him – a general feeling of those suffering from mental conditions. They worry about petty things, ramble senselessly and enter into flippant conversations about the most worthless things in life.Robert Redford puts forward a mirror in front of the audience and asks ""Are you being true to yourself? Can you really love? Do you really care?...."" and he does not wait for an answer. It is for the people to answer to themselves. His 'Ordinary People' is a bold, shattering and in-your-face experience that never preaches any ideal but only presents a case of contemporary lifestyle. Many may find it implausible – how can we be imperfect when we are so 'perfect'? What is perfect, really? Is anyone truly perfect? But it that an excuse for losing your place in the world? To give up your external sheen and expose your inner sanctuary? Such are the questions posed by Robert Redford and the author of the book of the same name. The movie can be named one of the finest in its genre – not satirical as American Beauty but very plain and realistic.Pauline Kael had criticized the characterization of Mary Tyler Moore's icy Beth Jarrett. Not many people are like Beth, right? But there are people just like Beth who themselves won't admit the 'Beth' they have in them. Beth is not an emotionless mannequin, she is a person conditioned to behave in this manner. I have a relative who is so unreasonable with her children for some reason, another who does not want to even hear anything sad – not even if it is a true sad story, another who is disliked by her own nieces but does not appear nasty at all. How do you explain such characters and their traits? Mary Tyler is not one dimensional; her character is layered based on all her past experiences. She seems hurt, not only by her son's death but by her life itself. But one can't be a sad sack in front of other people; gossips take no time to spread. Her character is not able to show her affection openly to her son, and she has her reasons.Calvin Jarrett played by Donald Sutherland is someone whom many people can empathize with. My mother herself is like Jarrett. He, like my mother, believes that everything will be fine and therefore tries to understand his afflicted son. One can almost feel Jarrett's fatherly nature towards his son – there is an invisible barrier between them because of this blood relationship. One generally tends to hide things from the person they truly love. That's why Conrad is so open with his counselor.Coming to Conrad, Timothy Hutton gives probably the most believable portrayal of a troubled person. The constant fidgeting, dwindling eye contact, shaky legs, blank stare and coldness – everything is immaculately done. Even the other girl from the hospital does her part naturally. In fact, everyone, right from his girlfriend to Conrad's male friends dutifully play their characters. It is as if you are watching actual lives being filmed. No wonder some people vehemently praise the 80s, saying that campy movies were given unnecessary importance. I believe them now – Ordinary People made me believe them. I only felt that Timothy's performance was too precious to hand him a supporting actor award. He should have been nominated for Best Actor instead.And Judd Hirsch himself was so fine as the psychologist. The suffocating setting, with most of the action taking place in single rooms gave the right feel for the movie. There was symbolism expressed in the movie too, through dialog, incomplete conversations, frequent camera cuts (or shifting, whatever you call it), objects, long pauses etc. One only has to see the film with an open mind. It will certainly be an eye opener.My Rating: 5 out of 5",Ordinary People
70,moviesleuth2,The acting carries the film,6,15 January 2008,"I am very critical of mainstream Hollywood because it keeps shelling out movies that are essentially the same. I like it when director's take risks because sometimes (usually) they make a better film, or at least an interesting one.""Ordinary People"" takes risks, mainly with its structure, but this is where the film fails. We are simply not given enough background into the back-story in order to become as invested in the film as it deserves. I chose the word ""deserves"" carefully and I mean it when I say it. Everything else about this film just begs to be in a classic modern American tragedy, but Redford jumps right in the middle of it while only providing snippets of a back-story. We know what happened, but as they say, a picture is worth 1000 words.I said that this film deserves a better structure, and I mean that. The acting is what makes this film more than watchable. To me, Donald Sutherland is a person who adeptly stands on the line between creepy and funny. Here, there is none of that. He is a wounded man who wants to keep his family together, but realizes that it is falling apart. For a twenty year old man, Timothy Hutton displays a large amount of talent for his years. We are able to feel for him despite knowing little about him. His therapist, Judd Hirsh, uses a mixture of tough love and sympathy that is surprisingly believable. Mary Tyler Moore in some ways steals the film. I never thought I could see a woman who is so cold and heartless as her character, but Moore is a cruel bitch, and one of the most detestable characters I have ever seen. One might identify her as the ""villain"" of the story, but that's a misconception. It's not that kind of a movie. That's the only way I can describe it.""Ordinary People"" is a great film, but it doesn't hit the notes it wants to because it doesn't realize that showing is better than telling, even if it adds to the running time (at least in this case).",Ordinary People
71,MichaelMargetis,"""Don't admire people too much, they might disappoint you. "" - Calvin Jarrett",9,9 August 2005,"Few films are so emotionally involved with it's subject and audience that it's almost too painful to watch. 'Ordinary People', Robert Redford's directorial debut, is a perfect example of these kinds of motion pictures. I've wanted to see this film for the longest time because of all it's positive buzz from both film critics and film buffs, and it's cast of incredible actors such as Donald Sutherland, Judd Hirsch, Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton was also appealing. I came across a copy of it at my local videostore and I knew I had to get it to see if it lived up to all it's hype (after all it did win Best Motion Picture of the Year over Scorsese's electrifying boxing biopic 'Raging Bull'). After I finished 'Ordinary People', I wasn't disappointed one bit. The film actually turned out to be better then I expected, with great directing (Redford won the Oscar), excellent writing and some of the finest acting a film has ever had. I guess you can say 'Ordinary People' succeeded in winning me over. Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, 'Ordinary People' is a powerful and captivating story of a family's struggle after loosing the eldest son to a freak boating . The film mostly surrounds the surviving son, Conrad 'Connie' Jarrett (Timothy Hutton). Conrad blames himself for what happened to his brother because he was there with him on the boat the night he drowned, and couldn't do anything to save him. We find Conrad fresh out of a mental hospital after a severe attempt, dealing with loss of his brother, his rocky relationship with his parents and his natural tendency to blame himself for everything. Conrad's father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland) is always supportive and tries to be there for Conrad, while his mother, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), who finds it impossible to show much needed affection to her guilt-ridden son. Conrad starts seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), to talk about his guilt issues, his friction with his parents and trying to get on with life. As the film progresses you see that Conrad isn't the only person in the family going through troubles, both Calvin and Beth have a hard time dealing with their eldest son's -- Calvin tries to talk about it and get passed it, while Beth tries her best to ignore it. 'Ordinary People' follows the struggle of this seemingly perfect wealthy Surburban household's struggle to get back to normal or something resembling it.Although I thought 'Raging Bull' should have beaten out 'Ordinary People' for Best Picture, I can definitely see why it won. 'Ordinary People' is a film a lot more people can relate to, then 'Raging Bull'. It deals with an issue that every parent fears more then anything in the world, and the struggles and hardships to recover or try to get past it. Robert Redford does a fabulous job with his directorial debut, while Alvin Sargent delivers a screenplay so moving, well-written and powerfully realistic that it's no wonder he picked up a much deserved Oscar for 'Best Adapted Screenplay'. I feel the best quality of this Oscar winner is the acting. Donald Sutherland gives such an incendiary and heart- wrenching performance that it's an absolute abomination he didn't receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Leading Actor. Mary Tyler Moore is magnificent in her startling turn as the unloving and emotionally scarred mother, while Judd Hirsch is perfectly cast in the role of the caring psychiatrist. However, the best aspect of the entire feature is definitely the astonishing and utterly amazing powerhouse of a performance of young Timothy Hutton (who rightfully received an Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role). Hutton does such a flawless job creating a character as complex, conflicted, heart-broken and confused as Conrad Jarrett. Everything about this film is -on except for it having some pacing problems towards the beginning. I urge you if you haven't already to take the time to sit down and view this stunning motion picture that I guarantee will move you emotionally.

72,JakeBrinkman,A humbling glance into humanity,6,28 November 2019,"Ordinary People's therapeutic dive into repressed psyches is presented so well that viewers can't help but sympathize with the main characters. The most moving moments are spread throughout the 2nd and 3rd acts. They did make my eyes well with tears, but spreading out the emotion meant I never got the solid blow that I needed to actually make any tears fall. The lack of music also took away from the emotional scenes by failing to amplify the drama. The acting and writing were spot on, but the cinematography was quite dated and often distracting (my first viewing was in 2019). It's a touching movie that's worth a watch, but it still leaves some to be desired.",Ordinary People
73,domino1003,Moore as Ice Queen,10,24 June 2005,"""Ordinary People"" is a story of what appears to be a happy family. On the surface, The Jarretts look like a happy, loving family. Underneath the surface shows a family that is so broken than nothing can fix it. Calvin (Donald Sutherland)and Beth (Mary Tyler Moore)look loving, but Beth is an Ice Queen. She may look loving, but she has a problem dealing with disorder in her life ever since her 2 sons were in a boating accident. Her firstborn, Buck, did not survive. Her other son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), survived and has incredible guilt. So much so that he had attempted suicide. His father is worried about his son, but cannot get his wife to open up about anything and is constantly trying to keep his family together. Beth's feelings toward her surviving son is disturbing: she shows no love, no comfort, no feelings toward him. She only reacts whenever he does something that she isn't happy about (Like when he quits the swim team without telling anyone. Her only reaction is what everyone else will think.). With the help of Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), Conrad learns to accept the fact that what happened was an accident, that he should not feel guilty for the tragedy that is slowly tearing his family apart.Robert Redford managed to get great performances out of all of his actors, particularly Mary Tyler Moore (MANY degrees from happy Mary Richards!)and Timothy Hutton. The film is gripping from beginning to end, as we watch a family slowly disintegrating before our very eyes.Other great performances includes Dinah Manoff and Elizabeth McGovern, as Karen and Jeannine, 2 young girls that will make an impact on Conrad's life.If you haven't seen this film, then you should rent it. A must have in your collection.",Ordinary People
74,dead47548,Far superior to 'Raging Bull'.,9,28 June 2008,"A very compelling and emotional drama about a family falling apart. I found it especially compelling due to how much I relate to Conrad Jarrett. His emotions and his reactions to those feel like they came right from my life, as did the relationships he had with his parents. The mother who didn't seem to care; the father who cared so much, but didn't know how to help. It was almost painful watching the film because I was scared of seeing how his life was going to turn out; for the majority of the film it seemed to only be getting worse and there's one scene that had me glued to the screen but completely afraid to see how it would result. It's an absolutely stunning film with highly emotional scenes that are going to stick with me for quite some time. The writing is realistic and sharp, with a few chinks here and there. But it's really the performances that make the film. Donald Sutherland is effortlessly perfect in one of the biggest snubs in Oscar history. His lack of a nomination is baffling. Mary Tyler Moore is frighteningly cold. But the star of the film is the young Timothy Hutton who gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. For such a young actor to realistically portray such strong, painful emotions both internally and externally is absolutely miraculous.",Ordinary People
75,roghache,Well crafted but dispiriting study of a family's grief & turmoil,5,28 March 2006,"This touching & well executed film is very well regarded, but I personally found it all a bit depressing. My first complaint is that this typical suburban WASP family isn't quite ordinary in terms of its finances, but somewhat affluent above the norm...all personified by the upscale pursuits of sailing and golfing, although Conrad & his girlfriend do go on a bowling date. This movie would never have been made about a blue collar family, who couldn't afford prolonged therapy and would have to make do without as best they could. Nor would the movie feature an Afro American family, whether rich or poor.The movie opens as the prosperous couple's teenage son, Conrad, is returning home from a mental institution. He has attempted suicide and is continuing in therapy due to survivor's guilt and turmoil following the accidental death in a sailing accident of his older brother, Buck. The parents, Beth and Calvin, are struggling to cope as well, and in the process their relationship is falling apart. Beth has become very emotionally withdrawn from Conrad, resenting the fact that he survived while Buck, her favorite, did not. However, she behaves in a normal fashion toward the outside world. Meanwhile, her affable husband, Calvin, is cheerful and doing everything possible to hold his family together.The acting is not to be faulted. The father, portrayed by Donald Sutherland, is a very sympathetic character, likable and doing his best. Mary Tyler Moore impeccably portrays the cold, withdrawn mother. However, I found Beth's character with her total emotional detachment from her surviving son (at the heart of this movie) not only unsympathetic but quite improbable. People do indeed respond differently to grief, but I found the disparity in this mother's feeling toward her two sons unbelievable. A more realistic response might instead surely have been for Beth to cling too tightly and overprotect her sole remaining (and apparently suicidal) son. Timothy Hutton truly shines here, giving an amazing performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden boy, Conrad, trying to recover from his ordeal without benefit of the love and support of his icy, distant mother.This movie brings to the forefront a little discussed statistic that marital break down is common among couples who lose a child. In addition, it graphically portrays the veneer often existing in seemingly happy, loving, well adjusted families, who conceal (sometimes quite successfully) their inner conflicts from the outside world. However, this film might have been a little more uplifting if the family had a faith dimension to it and not simply endless psychotherapy. I definitely have respect for psychiatry, but do not view therapists as miracle workers. Of course better therapy than the book, where Conrad is miraculously healed by having sex! I agree with another's comment that this film is basically a lengthy commercial for psychoanalysis...for the affluent of course.Accidental death of a child, grief, parent / child relationship strain, teenage mental illness, attempted suicide, and marital break down. These are indeed all too common occurrences in everyday life among ordinary people. Personally, however, I do not find these problems particularly entertaining to watch unfold on screen and, given the approach of only psychotherapy and no religious or other meaningful support, moving only in a negative and rather dispiriting way.",Ordinary People
76,bob_meg,A raw '70s documentary look at dysfunction from a 1980 movie,10,29 December 2008,"I saw this film when it was released as a sophomore in high school and was blown away by its candor and raw emotional truth. Come to think of it, I can't recall having seen an American movie prior to ""Ordinary People"" that really delved into repression of feeling and associated family dysfunction, and coming from a family very much steeped in that, it was quite refreshing...like, ""oh, I guess I'm not crazy after all to see how insane this situation really is."" I think that note, and especially Timothy Hutton's transcendent performance, accounted for it's popularity among adolescent audiences of the time. The performances by all three principles are nothing less than revelatory, though. Donald Sutherland once more proves his chops as perhaps the most understated actor of our time...he can communicate more with a few looks than most actors can in paragraphs. Mary Tyler Moore takes a truly unredeemable character (in the book, especially, Beth was portrayed as a hysterical, spoiled, selfish woman-child) and actually generates pity and some sympathy for her character.Being from the North Shore myself, the movie really gets the insulated, isolated settings right (and in fall of all seasons, perfect). Apart from his beautiful work with the actors, Redford really brings the town of Lake Forest alive as a character here. His composition is marvelous, the lighting iridescent. There's such an immediate sense of realism to many scenes that it really feels like you're ""in them"" smelling the smells and feeling the textures of the landscapes and buildings. Best one-shot: overhead POV of the breakfast table: Beth sets two glasses down at once, then waits a beat and sets the third.The supporting cast is just as incredible: the underrated Dinah Manoff (""Let's make this the best year of our whole lives....we can you know!""), M. Emmett Walsh (""I wouldn't have let them put electricity in MY head!""), Frederic Lehne, Meg Mundy, Adam Baldwin, and of course Elizabeth McGovern, who lends a much-needed blast of honesty and innocence in one of her earliest roles.And of course, last but not least, Judd Hirsch who brings a completely unaffected air to a role that could have been really sappy and maudlin.You just can't get better drama than ""Ordinary People."" That it was Redford's first time out as director is almost impossible to believe. And that Tim Hutton never was able to find source material to measure up to this is sad and equally incredible.",Ordinary People
77,room102,Powerful and depressing,9,22 October 2002,"Ordinary People (1980), Robert Redford's directorial debut, proves that Redford is not only a good actor, but also an excellent director.

It won 4 academy awards: Best picture, best director (Redford), best supporting actor (Timothy Hutton, in his first feature film, at the early age of 20) and best writing. It was also nominated for best leading actress (Mary Tyler Moore) and best supporting actor (Judd Hirsch).
Two sad and ironic incidents that happened prior to the filming may be counted for the superb acting: The tragic death of Mary Tyler Moore's only child, Ritchie (an accident caused by a defective gun) and the passing away of Timothy Hutton's father, actor Jim Hutton. Also appearing: Elizabeth McGovern, M. Emmet Walsh, Adam Baldwin and of course, Donald Sutherland in one of his best performances (which definitely deserved an Oscar too).

81,doug_park2001,"""If you can't feel pain, you're not going to feel anything else either""",8,24 April 2014,"The first half of ORDINARY PEOPLE is uneventful, focusing mostly on the ""ordinary"" daily life of this Middle American family who, though they suffered a great tragedy in the death of their older son several years earlier and are now struggling with their younger son's depression and suicidal tendencies, seem at first like the Brady Bunch in their normality. {That being said, I'm not so sure the Brady Bunch were as quite as ""normal"" as their creators intended.} The first hour is so quiet and routine that it's easy to overlook the big conflicts going on beneath the surface, not just with the ""troubled"" surviving son but with the ""ordinary"" parents. Though things intensify somewhat in the second half, this film may not appeal to many of today's audiences who want a lot of fast action, twists, and suspense. The acting is also rather wooden by modern standards, but I think that may have been intentional as all three members of the family are slowly, subtly revealed to be not so ""ordinary"" after all. Mary Tyler Moore gives a memorable performance as Beth the mother, a polite, apparently painfully everyday person who's entirely severed many basic connections with the human race. Calvin the father (Donald Sutherland)is the most wooden of all, but the way he's revealed to be the most neurotic in many ways, something realistically unfitting for a tax attorney, makes him convincing in the end. Likewise for younger son Conrad(Timothy Hutton), who appears to be such an everyday kid that it's easy to forget that he recently tried to ""off"" himself. The true heart and soul of this film, however, is Judd Hirsch as Berger the psychiatrist, a truly one-in-a-billion character.ORDINARY PEOPLE is a mass of contradictions. Not a lot of big events for a two-hour film, and some will inevitably find it just plain boring. Yet, more in the way of dramatic action--longer, more detailed flashbacks to the older son's drowning and Conrad's suicide attempt, etc--would somehow have detracted from it. The mood is consistently somber, like an unusually good soap opera, but there are some truly hilarious lines scattered in, and for today's audiences the 1980 styles (particularly Calvin's plaid golf trousers) will also provide some comic relief. Some inconsistencies that still work because they fit the theme of the film so well: As Calvin puts it, ""I guess the whole of life is an accident."" ORDINARY PEOPLE often seems like a sort of 1980s After-School Special for Adults, with a number of too-easies, but even if it isn't entirely convincing, there's something nonetheless real about it in a way that can only be accomplished through fiction. The loaded dialogue is full of hackneyed pop psychology phrases, but despite, or even because of, the frequent corniness, ORDINARY PEOPLE succeeds at being truly touching.Disturbing subject matter and lots of realistic profanity, but nothing else (no sex/nudity or serious gore/violence) that really justifies the ""R"" rating.",Ordinary People

There is, in my opinion, not one moment in this film that feels false or ""acted"". Utter realism, all the way. The dialogue is extremely well written, but Redford's not afraid to use silence as well.I'm surprised it didn't receive more Oscars than it did (Best Movie, Best Screenplay, Best Director and, oh yes, Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Timothy Hutton. Fantastic Performance!), and even more surprised to find out that Donald Sutherland wasn't even nominated!

83,macpherr,Brilliant!,10,22 December 1999,"A very interesting story about the emotional roller coaster that a dysfunctional family went through because of the tragic, premature and accidental death of one of their children. ""Conrad"" Timothy Hutton (French Kiss) very deservingly won an Oscar for the part of the surviving son. Conrad was a very sensitive young man, who learned how to cope with depression after the death of his brother,  and was trying to learn how to deal with the complete lack of communication between him and his mother Mary Tyler Moore (Flirting with Disaster). His mother, Beth, was a perfectionist. Her house was immaculate. The drawers were perfect. She made life difficult on herself and everyone around her. Such as: for the funeral of her son, she asked her husband, ""Calvin"" Donald Sutherland (Without Limits)  to wear a different pair of shoes than the ones he had picked. All she did was for appearance, what others would think! I wonder how Robert Redford (A River Runs Through It, The Legend of Bagger Vance) decided to pick that story for a movie. Brilliant! That shows his genius as a Director. He won an Oscar for the his directorial debut, after no big studio would support this project. We are talking Robert Redford here.  He did this in a very tight budget. This is a classic and timeless movie; Redford's first master piece. This movie will endure the test of time. I recommend it! This movie scores a ten! My favorite Scenes: When Conrad realized that he needed to talk to someone and called his psychiatrist. It was very mature of him. When Conrad was singing in the choir. Conrad practiced vocalism after Jannine complimented him for his nice voice. My favorite quotes: Berger: ""A real problem and has a real solution. Recognize that she has limitations."" Conrad: ""Like can't love me!"" Berger:"" No, kiddo, no! Like she can't love you enough. Don't blame her for more than she is able."" Conrad: ""Anyway..."" Jeannine: ""What?

85,jeremy3,One of the Best,10,16 September 2006,"I am familiar with Lake Forest, Illinois. It is a beautiful and wealthy suburb of Chicago. Not a typical setting for a film, however. It is very obvious, from the onset of the film, that this is about an upper-middle class family in the Midwest. Donald Sutherland plays the kindliest and most caring father. He is truly concerned about what has happened to his youngest son (Timothy Hutton) since the death of his eldest son in a boating accident. Hutton will never be able to exceed this role, which he played at the age of just 19 or 20. Hutton is terrific as a being a normal teenager whose life is in turmoil with guilt since his brother died. Mary Tyler Moore is the exact opposite of Mary Richards. She plays a remote, superficial person, who can't cope with the loss and with her surviving son's emotions. Judd Hirsch is great as the psychologist who finally lets his patient know that it wasn't his fault, his brother was just not strong enough to be rescued. There was a great scene when Sutherland and Moore go to Texas, and they ended up arguing. Their friends on the golf course are mortified by their display of anger. They just can't understand what's gone wrong with this perfect couple. It is also noteworthy that the movie was set during Christmas time, when people are supposed to be happy. I think that for Moore, Hirsch, Sutherland, and Hutton, this will be the performances that they will be most remembered for.",Ordinary People

The Jarretts are well settled and well fixed in the Chicagoland suburbs until a boating accident leaves one son dead and the other son mentally at wits end because he is of the opinion he could have saved his brother had he tried harder. Once the younger son is hospitalized for a suicide attempt the film opens as the bitter mother brilliantly portrayed by Mary Tyler Moore deals with her anxiety toward her now mentally at wits end son brilliantly portrayed by Timothy Hutton. His well meaning father played by Donald Sutherland recruits the aid of a psychiatrist played by Judd Hirsch to complete the principal cast. Supporting the younger son in his quest to return to normalcy are M. Emmett Walsh as his school coach and Elizabeth McGovern as agirl of his age interested in his company. Driving yet another wedge between father and mother beyond how to best deal with their one surviving son is their socieoconomic background differences which slowly come to light as the film brilliantly progresses. Because more commercial films include travelogues of the city of Chicago not of suburban Chicagoland another strong point of the film is its excellent travelogue of suburban Chicagoland's gold coast northern suburbs.,Ordinary People
87,antagonist117,"A competent and compassionate movie that, as Best Picture winners go, could have done more to distinguish itself from the pack",7,29 March 2014,"Most people who watch ""Ordinary People"" today, 35 years on, surely do so because they're Oscar completists. For a lot of people making their way through the list, it's probably one of the last Best Picture winners they make themselves sit down and watch. It's acquired an unfortunate reputation as being one of the Academy's notable ""mistakes,"" since it beat the more stylistically-challenging ""Raging Bull."" The reason that's unfortunate is that it's unfair to the movie, which taken on its own terms is a perceptive examination of a family's grief.In honoring ""Ordinary People"" with the Best Picture and Best Director statues, Hollywood awarded for the first time one of its most genial figures, Robert Redford. As his directorial debut this is, appropriate enough, a genial movie. But it is difficult to explain why it is a good movie without explaining why it is not a great movie. It is a serious film that deals with death and suicide and broken homes, but it must be acknowledged even by the sympathetic reviewer that its handling of these issues is not much more serious or creative than a ""Very Special Episode"" of some '80s or '90s TV drama. It focuses squarely, all too squarely, on the ""humanity"" of its characters, and it hand-holds the audience through the plot all too gently. It feels, if not preachy, then like a therapy session that we've been assigned to attend because we have not been sufficiently attentive to the pain within ourselves and others. The always-on, always-sensitive tone of this kind of storytelling can be exhausting because it lacks the temporary relief that a little cynicism and distance can provide. The movie demands that you care for all of its characters all the time. This is a tough ask under the best of conditions, but especially when the characters hew too close to stock stereotypes. The high school students all fall pretty neatly into the standard categories of brainless jocks and quirky loners, and the parents are the overly-busy, clueless, grown-apart kinds we've seen before. At the beginning, Redford's directorial style, with its straight-on symmetrical shots of a dining room table and a camera that looks back and forth at people having a conversation like a crowd looks at a tennis match, seems equally unoriginal, but this decision actually pays off toward the end when the same pace and simplicity are used in cross-cutting a flashback sequence. The person having the flashback is really having a long-delayed, straightforward dialogue with himself, and the visual style suits this culmination well. Yet it is, after all, much the same as other revelatory and epiphany-making flashbacks in film and TV.The ordinariness of ""Ordinary People"" is probably held against it more than it would be had it not won its Oscars, but at the same time far fewer people would probably watch it today had it not won them. And that would be a shame, because despite its shortcomings, it is an occasionally very perceptive film. For all the times it is too ""on the nose"" with a song choice (""Hallelujah"" when a character is happy) or a line of dialogue (how many times has ""I miss him too, you know!"" been declaimed on screen?), there are also moments of real observational insight, as when an introverted character presses the ""close door"" button on an elevator rather than risk a social encounter. That rings true, and thankfully it happens without being directly commented upon. The movie also casts Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore against type, which is interesting to see. To watch ""Ordinary People"" is to be reminded that Redford is, by all appearances, a refreshingly warmhearted and compassionate celebrity in an industry that too often rewards egoists and borderline sociopaths. I may be in a minority, but I frankly think it's nice that movies like this can and do win Best Picture over movies that are superior in technique but colder and bleaker in outlook.",Ordinary People

He is meek, so he has not any control over anything in his life. He cannot change any situation as he cannot turn anything wrong into anything right. The psychologist tries to help the son, but he cannot replace Calvin Jarrett. The father should do something as soon as possible! Otherwise, they may lose their only alive son. There is a sudden death in the middle of the movie which was harsh, but also very realistic like real life. The direction is not a work of art or not powerful, but professional and flawless. At the end, there is one of the most unexpected and unforgettable finals ever made and it has the last word! I think what makes this movie a masterpiece is especially and particularly its final. As for A Donald Sutherland, he gives an unbelievable, stark and realistic performance.",Ordinary People
91,iwatcheverything,Ordinary People = Ordinary Film,5,26 August 2003,Besides being a very long and drawn out drama with absolutely no surprises this film lacked something.  It was pretty much exactly like any other film of it's type.  The whole my mother doesn't love me crisis is way to old and widely used.  So is the life isn't worth living thoughts that are through out the film.  I have seen many other dramas of this type that had redeeming qualities.  This film even sort of reminded me of Good Will Hunting at some parts but not as good.This film did have one thing that made it worth watching and that was an outstanding performance by Donald Sutherland.  He did the best that I have ever seen him.  Much better than the movies he has tried of late.All in all this film could have been much better.  Take the time only if you have nothing else to do.,Ordinary People
92,imbluzclooby,"Influential and poignant in its day, but ......",6,4 March 2008,"It would be quite boring, weak, lethargic and outdated for today's audience, even in retrospect. Before I evaluate the movie we must first consider that 1970's and early 1980's melodramas of the upper class dominated the market in Hollywood. It was also novel to show them in such personal detail as Ordinary People did. Robert Redford makes his directing debut and definitely his most personal piece of work to date. I believe his golden boy image of that era contributed significantly to the success of this movie. Based on Judith Guest's novel, which I'll demure I've never read, centers around a friendly business man Calvin, his haughty and cold wife, Beth, and their emotionally disturbed son, Conrad. They are an upper class family living in the suburbs of Chicago who have suffered a loss of a son. This is established early and the slice of life drama envelops into a touching, thoughtful and sometimes poignant tale of a family in crisis. I believe this script and screenplay was well crafted for those who can sink their teeth into personal melodramas where you get to unravel and study the characters' motivations and feelings. This can be and was interesting for those folks who can identify with this. This is the type of smut where curious people sit back and try to psychoanalyze the subjects from their pseudo layman's perspective. There is little to zero entertainment value in this stodgy tale. It is morose, inert, incensing and anticlimactic. Unfortunately the audience for this kind of movie has shrunk progressively and would have a hard time enrapturing most cultures and communities today. Of course it would, why should we grieve for affluent yuppies when there are numerous families under much worse circumstances who have suffered personal losses, not to mention health and financial?But identification with this Ordinary People is not all its worth. Redford does a good job of selective directing to reveal the character's thoughts and insecurities in the most subtle way, a talent which is rare to come by. I'm not a Redford fan by any means, but this raises the question whether the credit should be given to the actors for emoting subtlety or credit to the director.The acting, although first rate, is a bit forced at times especially from Hutton (Conrad) and Moore (Beth. But for his young years as an actor, Timothy Hutton really shines. I felt he really conveyed the painful feelings of teenage isolation and estrangement from his nuances at school, his bland and sterile home life and the nagging of his mother to the scenes with his sweetly awkward father Sutherland (Calvin). This is your typical waspy family that you would normally find in the Northeast during the 70's and 80's. On the surface everything appears plush with manicured lawns, stately houses to the preppy clothes. But underneath that superficial Americana exterior is a tense and nervous amalgam of turmoil ready to erupt. As they cope with this tragedy in a suppressed manner we eventually see the veneer of denial crack to the point where Calvin has his confrontation with Beth following her ultimate breakdown.Although I felt Moore was perfectly cast and the epitome of Beth in looks and persona, I thought her acting had miscalculated and needed closer attention and direction at times. Her performance throughout was rather one dimensional until her epiphany at the climax. Playing a vain and pretentious woman with a fragile ego and heart of ice can be tricky. You can tell they actors were playing close attention to details of their psyche and how they should behave. It can't be easy to convey all those qualities with an inferior script. Sutherland actually acquits himself rather well although I would have done some things differently in his role. To me Donald Sutherland has always been adept at being either creepy or odd. But here he is an absolute model husband, fulfilling the executive role.Judd Hirsh, Doctor Gerber, is a refreshing addition to this bland mold of characters. He is the quirky counselor for Conrad. His sincerity and intentions are directly motivated form the heart, although he is so different from the family.My main problem with this movie is that it is drab. It has no rhythm or beat to inspire us moving forward from one scene to the next. It's basically a series of uncomfortable scenes strung together in a dull daisy chain of events. For example, the Conrad character lashing out at his father while taking a picture with his mom has an improbable false note. Everyone stands their in wordless shock with their mouths agape. If this is the neuroses of Upper class Americans I'm a bit incredulous and put off.Families in crisis can be an involving and moving subject, but this movie doesn't embrace its audience, but leaves us with a cold and clammy feeling that people have communication problems and are unable to connect or relate for whatever reasons. And after seeing Ordinary People, those reasons are still unexplained.",Ordinary People
93,dataconflossmoor,Ordinary is the Problem!!!!!,10,29 September 2005,"The setting for this movie is seemingly appropriate for characterizing frustrations...The North Shore!!...Chicago's sequestered citadel of professional and avaricious elitism...A three million dollar home, trips to Europe, your kids going off to the most expensive colleges in the country, remodeling your kitchen every couple of years, and, your work-less, socially active wife being a permanent fixture at Marshall Fields!! All of these trademarks of success are taken for granted, and, they are merely expectations for the ultimate definition of a quiet bedroom community!! Acquisition of status is no longer excitement, it is, in fact, a given...The only devastating misconception to this entire scenario is that people living in the North Shore are not superhuman, they are merely overburdened, socially, financially, physically, mentally and, as this film so brilliantly depicts, EMOTIONALLY!! There is a prevailing mentality of a mandated and bothersome agenda that all of the characters in this movie must adhere to!!...The Jarretts (Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton) are a family who are shattered by perpetual tragedy and isolation, each one of them does not know what to do about the fact that the other son, Buck, has died, and Conrad (Timothy Hutton) has attempted to commit suicide!! So much of this film deals with how the misunderstanding of each other is the monster that will win out!!.. Perseverence is something that the mother thinks she can handle, but, in fact, she cannot!! The son, Conrad, lacks the necessary social stamina for the incredibly tedious task of sustaining! Finally, the father needs a bevy of facts to gather up in order for him to attain a pleasant resolve by which everyone in his family may live by!!.. This catastrophic dilemma is answered with social gatherings, vacations, an inordinate preoccupation with moral facades, and expensive therapy!! The bottom line is that a tragic undermining to every critical situation in this movie continuously prevails! Ultimately, this troublesome circumstance is such whereby Conrad and his parents need more time than this movie allows to heel all wounds even on a superficial level...Director, Robert Redford, has an incredible insight in this movie, and many white collar executive households share the exacerbations and misgivings of financial competition that this Lake Forest household had to endure!!...""Ordinary People"" won for best picture in 1980, and, it is no wonder...The despondence the Jarretts faced was a horror story that could teach Stephen King a couple of tricks... The Mother feels as though she must create an illusion of contentment to the outside world, even if it is at the risk of neglecting her family's needs...Masquerading pretenses seems to have become her self-centered pet project...The father, while well intentioned, is meager and adolescent in his approach to coping with the household's turbulent consternation..It is almost as if he expects a resolution to his family's problems to be put in his stocking on Christmas morning...The son, Conrad, just resigns himself to misery and arctic desolation!! The overall predicament in this film has a frightening simplicity... The Jarret's aggregate plight is that they are alone, unhappy and confused!! Judd Hirsch is terrific as the shrink who feels sorry for this high school kid (Conrad). Conrad Jarrett is compelled to have therapy sessions with him,(Judd Hirsch). As a psychiatrist, he knows that he has to go through professionally therapeutic procedures to actually help him out...The greatest help he can offer Conrad is that he must convey to him that his problems can only be solved one step at a time. This psychiatrist (Judd Hirsch) cannot simply utter some miracle mumble jumble like Conrad's father expects him to do!! ""Ordinary People"" is about ordinary, well to do, upper middle class people, these are people who constantly admonish themselves for making mistakes!! They perennially imitate wealthy people, which means they are continuously fighting a losing battle! Genuine problems such as a son attempting suicide have to take a back seat to endeavors which are along the line of status games and pusillanimous charades of compulsory escalation into the realm of social register advancement!!.. Just another $250,000.00 yearly income household...ho hum!!...What is bothering you? ""Everything!!"" ""Did we say that""...""We mean to say that nothing at all is bothering us""....The purpose of a two acre piece of property is not to be a voice in the wilderness.. Apocalyptic human pitfalls rest on apathetic shaky grounds in Chicago's North Shore Suburbia, and, they are indiscriminately shelved off into a dubious haven of callous anonymity!! Calvin Jarrett is plagued by the shattering realization of just how pitiful it is to have to attend your own son's funeral!! Tragedy fights dirty pool when it will not even allow the Jarretts to know exactly what the unanswered questions are in their dreadfully befuddled lives!! This situational dilemma manifests itself by pointing out several acrimonious facts: People who seem alright may not be. Household upheaval and family hardships will go quite awhile before they are even mollified. Also, the beautiful cinematography of the deciduous Lake Forrest autumn erupts as a polar opposite to what emotional ugliness lurks in the Jarrett's domicile!! This movie concludes at a glimmer of hope for Conrad, which symbolizes a demoralizing, and almost hopelessly rudimentary progress for the entire Jarrett Family, YES!! this is very, very, very, DEPRESSING!!! Unfortunately, this situation is extremely realistic! ""Ordinary People"" is an outstanding movie for a variety of reasons.. Mostly for the fact that it illustrates how clinical depression cannot be instantly cured just because there are only 18 minutes left to the movie!! I give it five stars out of five stars!!!",Ordinary People
94,hoernkeem,"Ordinary People (1980, Robert Redford) Good performances bolster what otherwise could have been a very vanilla movie of the week type project.",7,12 May 2021,"This film, directed by Robert Redford, won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1980. It has a very top heavy cast featuring Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton in his film debut. It was nominated for a total of six Academy Awards winning four. The film deals with an affluent family living in Chicago that immediately would seem to have everything going for them, however, the family unit has been steadily dissolving since the older of the two children, Buck, died in a boating accident. While keeping a veneer of austerity and sanity the family is, in reality circling the toilet bowl of total dissolution. While good I don't know if I would consider this a Best Picture film even though it checks all the boxes the Academy was looking for in those days. From a historical perspective it seems criminal that this film took Picture and Director away from Scorsese's 'Raging Bull'. This was also the first directorial effort for Redford who was already a Hollywood darling at that point.'Ordinary People' starts serene and picturesque in white middle America. It starts so bucolically pointing to this as the modern American dream utopia that it is hard to fathom how anything could be amiss. As the layers of the onion peel away, though, it becomes clear that all is not peachy keen in paradise. In fact everything is far from alright. At the outset this would feel like a very stable family unit that had two high school age boys. One of the boys perishes in a boating accident that leaves the whole family haunted dealing with emotions in a variety of ways and subsequently exposing deep seeded flaws that have now bubbled to the surface. Timothy Hutton, in an excellent debut that earned him an Oscar, plays Conrad Jarrett who tried to kill himself following his brother's death and after a stint in a mental hospital is still struggling. He starts seeing a psychiatrist played by Judd Hirsch. Mary Tyler Moore playing completely against type is excellent as the rigid, unemotional, detached yet also damaged Beth Jarrett, and Donald Sutherland is the patriarch who is processing his own feelings for the loss but also his emotions toward his eroding marriage. All of this swirls around until a few factors cause a lot of it to rise and surface with some good emotional scenes and some much needed catharsis although the stability of the family as constructed may be beyond reclamation.This film is probably as good as acting could get at the dawn of the 1980's especially for a pretty sedate melodrama. The actors, for the most part, diverted from flashy, easy outbursts instead concentrating on understated, contained performances. Timothy Hutton's performance is the flashiest and as a result he gets to chew the most scenery but really the performances of Sutherland and Moore really hammer the emotional plot home. Redford won an Oscar for directing although I don't think the directing job is in any way superlative. That is not to put Redford down, but just to say that this story isn't prime for any unique directorial vision. This was a decent film and worth recognition, but I am not certain the great performances vault this into one of the best films of 1980.Eric's Grade: B.",Ordinary People
95,Condemned-Soul,"Emotional, Powerful, Rewarding, Timeless.",9,13 April 2020,"A powerful drama about tension and tragedy within a normal household, 'Ordinary People' is a worthy best picture winner that is difficult not to be moved to tears by the end.Timothy Hutton puts in a remarkable, Oscar-winning performance as Conrad, a troubled teen dealing with his brother's death while trying to move on from a suicide attempt. His father, Donald Sutherland, is the easygoing father, seemingly okay, whereas his mother, played by Mary Tyler Moore, cuts a difficult figure, denying her son's affection and refusing to accept the blame she has placed on Conrad since losing her son.This is Hutton's film (despite the supporting actor win), and we follow and support him in his depressed state which he tries to mask from everyone around him, causing rifts with his friends and hurting his school prospects. We feel the anger and emotion boiling within him, hear and disbelieve the excuses he gives, while hoping for an optimistic journey alongside this likeable character. And he's helped immensely by his psychiatrist - the excellent Judd Hirsch - in coming to terms with the source of his pain and hatred.But even though he's the protagonist, the entire family dynamic is an issue that needs combating. And throughout the film, sure enough, this trio of everyday people - this family of varying degrees of visible despair - must not only confront their inner demons, but overcome them. They face each other, dig up the truth buried in their psyches, lash out, cry, unburden their pain... And as the viewer we are inextricably linked to these people, swept away in a believable life, feeling what they feel along the way to deliverance.It's a striking family portrait of tragedy filled with moving performances, with a script that understands how to tackle such difficult subject matters. And it's all deftly directed by Robert Redford, who rightly won an Oscar, with a tender and measured eye for drama. 'Ordinary People' is an amazing experience because of how real it feels, and that's ultimately what lends the drama so much power.9/10",Ordinary People

Sadly I can relate to too much of the movies theme - but happily I can say I must have gotten even so much more from seeing it. It was gutwrenching to watch the tormenting of young Timothy Hutton's character. So powerful, and so real, that it ripped up parts of my own past - reminding me clearly of my own family's confrontation with tragedy and battles with subsequent psychiatric problems. It is so good it can only have been written by someone who experienced what Sutherland, Moore and Hutton's characters endure in the movie. In relating I can say one thing about this powerful masterpiece that I wouldn't say about any other: any person giving this movie a bad review is WRONG! In any case that would surely mean that they don't relate to the subject of the film and therefore don't have the faintest idea what they're talking or writing about. Next to other modern classics like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Kramer vs Kramer"" this is the very definition of a MOVING picture. Hats off to the solid acting of Hutton, Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore, and to everyone else involved in the realization of this family drama.",Ordinary People
97,cosmorados,One of the best ever best picture winners to be forgotten,9,26 June 2008,"Conrad is the youngest son of Cal and Beth, and recovering from clinical depression and a suicide attempt after a boating accident killed his elder brother, Bucky. The family is fractured and both Cal and Beth are on auto pilot through their daily lives, of the two of them, however, Cal is the only one slightly aware of it.The family itself is from a middle class background and the film examines what happens when something goes wrong for one of these oh so ordinary and perfect families for whom tragedy is an unexpected and unknown visitor. Beth hates Conrad for both surviving and for not coping as Conrad is most like her, Cal is desperate to look after Cal and not lose what he's got, while Conrad himself wants to regain control outwardly, but what he really longs for is not to feel any more, feeling that he is responsible in some way for his brother's death.As the film progresses and Conrad's therapy starts we learn more about the family before the accident, with the oh-so popular Bucky appearing more like a foolhardy Jock that, perhaps, in hind sight, wasn't as great as the more laid back Conrad, with things finally resolving and reaching crisis point at the same time.This is one of the great forgotten best picture winners of the last thirty years that is full of award winning performances, with Judd Hirsch as Condrad's Doctor, played with both warmth, conviction and professionalism, Timothy Hutton's Oscar winning turn as the shattered Conrad who sees, feels and recollects the tragedy that has occurred ever single day, but the towering performance coming from a Mary Tyler Moore so unlike anything she has done before as she is incapable of growing and moving on from what has happened.Robert Redford's direction is subtle, combining the coming to terms with tragedy with the bland ordinariness of daily lives, with the handling of Conrad's depression being especially touching (The echoes of which can be seen in the 'okay' ""Good Will Hunting"").A touching and emotionally connecting film that once seen stays with you, long after the closing credits.",Ordinary People

In this story a son is killed in a sailing accident, and we get to see how a father, mother and brother deal with the stress. Grief can unmask things about people that would otherwise remain unseen; sometimes it unveils an ugliness far beyond expectations.When one of two sons, Buck dies, his brother becomes suicidally depressed. His mother, on the other hand, pulls the old ostrich bit- head in the sand with the old ""I don't want to talk about it"" routine. The dopey but likable father goes all Rodney King on us with the ""Can't we all just , get along?""The dialogue is what makes this movie great. When the surviving son tries to talk with his mother, it is so awkward and cringe inducing, it is hard to watch. It is obvious that the guy is struggling, and is looking for a little understanding from mom. The kid finds some understanding from a shrink, which can happen, but his mom is no help at all. She is much more worried about the way things look, than the way her son feels. ""I had to find out you quit the swim team from Beth Meyerson???, WHAT WILL THE NEIGHBORS THINK?""She lives in a flat out mansion, spends her time golfing and ""doing lunch"", can obviously afford cosmetic surgery (wink wink), and has a great bod for a woman of her age. Yet, all she worries about is her vacations, clothing, image, in short herself. Look up ""rich bitch"" in the dictionary and there is an image of her, retouched of course.Some of the negative reviews I have read seem to miss the point. People react differently to grief, sometimes even in a bad way, and yes, it can be the mother who can behave badly. Granted, this is not the norm, but it does occur. That is what makes this so interesting, we get to see an unusual reaction from an unusual family member. Some viewers are so indoctrinated into the PC world of feminist scrip writing that it seems to melt they're butch-wax when they see anybody but the adult male portrayed as the villain.In this piece , the father and son are the ones with the wisdom and understanding, and it is the female that wears the black hat.

Now it's on DVD and I just re-saw it and it's as impressive now as it was over 2 decades ago. A teen-ager (Timothy Hutton) is torn apart by surviving a boating accident that drowned his older brother. Entire cast is flawless and it deserved the 4 Academy Awards, plus more: Best Actress - Mary Tyler Moore (nominated and an abomination that she lost, it's her all-time best performance in any medium, and one of the best of last century), Best Actor - Donald Sutherland (not even nominated, but a wrenching portrayal), Best Supporting Actor - Judd Hirsh (would have been nice to tie with Hutton, who's really the Lead, anyway). The music, mostly Canon in D, is beautifully realized, Robert Redford is a masterful director. Nothing is pat or predictable, with almost expected resolutions and reconciliations not materializing. In the scene where Moore sees Hutton on the lawn chair and request he put on the jacket to escape wintry cold, while the Canon concerto plays in the background, one expects it to end triumphantly for both parties (who've been clashing), but not here. And special mention must be made of Dinah Minaff's riveting acting. In only one scene with Hutton (as a former hospital patient), she plays a character who looks and acts normal, but one starts to feel that she is still not quite ""right"" (she never even drinks her Cola).

100,lucasversantvoort,"Not exactly original, but Redford's empathy helps",7,6 May 2015,"Ordinary People is a film arguably most remembered for the fact it ""stole"" the Oscars for Best Picture and Director from Scorsese's Raging Bull which is now considered the more impressive and influential film. Ordinary People, in all honesty, is far from the terrible film people perceive it to be since it 'stole the Oscar from Raging Bull.' I have come across descriptions along the lines of 'a TV film that got lucky,' etc. The question of which film should have won the Oscar is irrelevant when judging the film itself. The fact is that film buffs all over the world have used the Academy's stupidity to avert their eyes from Ordinary People's virtues which are plentiful.Ordinary People, unsurprisingly, is about ordinary peoplemore or less. It fits into the tradition of films that are interested in exploring how Happy Suburban Life of the '50s is merely an illusion. On the surface, the Jarrett family – consisting of Calvin (Donald Sutherland), Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) and their son Conrad (Timothy Hutton) – appears to be a typical happy family. Beneath it all however, Conrad is suffering from PTSD and survivors guilt due to losing his brother Buck in a sailing accident, Beth is obsessed with keeping up appearances and denies her own feelings on losing Buck, and Calvin attempts to get closer to both Conrad and his emotionally distant wife.It's easy to pigeonhole Beth as the 'villain,' but the film shows such psychological insight that it allows us to empathize with her, to understand her despite her acting like a bitch toward Conrad on a pretty regular basis. We know she's suppressing her own emotions, we know Conrad probably reminds her of Buck and she can't handle it. Moore's performance only enhances this feeling of empathy. Moore had pretty much become America's Sweetheart through shows like The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but showed a lot of guts here in breaking free of that mold and showing she could play a challenging, emotionally complex character.As with the character of Beth, the rest of the characters (most notably, of course, Calvin and Conrad) are treated with the same amount of respect by director Robert Redford and the screenplay. Though I've never been much of a Sutherland fan, he plays this part pretty darn well, displaying the awkwardness of wanting to improve the relationship with his son while also being forced to reevaluate his marriage to Beth. Timothy Hutton would never land a role on this level again, proving that Oscars don't singlehandedly launch careers into stardom. Like Moore, Judd Hirsch breaks his Taxi persona and plays Conrad's very likable therapist in an all too rare display of film therapy done well. While the subject matter (PTSD, denial, the illusion of a happy life, etc.) well-trodden territory, it's the execution and director Redford's empathy for the characters that makes Ordinary People a fulfilling experience.",Ordinary People

The novel is quite beautiful, but it's first person, so you're in the heads of the characters and are aware of the motivations for their behavior throughout. The film works better than the novel because what is so fundamental about this story - a family who have collectively experienced a tragedy so shattering, that they all shatter too in its aftermath - is the repression of emotion between father, mother and son, and what is then left unsaid between them becomes the most powerful.

103,AZINDN,An Enormous Skeleton in the Family Closet,8,24 September 2007,"Ordinary People is the story of a family struggling to right itself after an enormous tragedy, the death of the eldest son, Buck. Drown in a boating accident, the fair-haired boy of the town was expected to be the most successful ever, especially to his parents (Mary Tyler Moore, Donald Sutherland), and most obvious, to his younger brother, Conrad (Timothy Hutton). Buck died, Conrad lived, and the guilt of having survived eats at Conrad to the point of attempted suicide and hospitalization. For his mother, Beth however, the loss of her favorite son is more than she will tolerate. Beth is from good strong stock, stiff upper lip, and don't let the neighbors know what is going on within the family. She is cold, withdrawn from her surviving son, and unwilling to recognize Conrad's suffering. To comfort her son would mean she condones his survival, and it would be the ultimate betrayal of Buck, the good son.Robert Redford in his directorial debut paints a bittersweet portrait of such ordinariness as the norm, it is a slice of the era before the self-indulgent me generation. Normalcy in the affluent middle class mid-western family does not include psychiatry, a situation Beth wants hidden from their friends. Beth grasps at the belief that what is not discussed in the open will go away, including Conrad. Moore as the flawed Beth gives a master performance by an actress known for her comedic talents in the role of a repressed, bitter, and prejudiced woman. She is devastating in a portrayal of a self-absorbed, controlling, emotionless wife but not a sympathetic mother. Timothy Hutton as Conrad is a wounded puppy, floundering for attention and affection from his rebuking, accusatory mother and weak father. It is a heartbreaking performance that is all raw emotional subtlety to view. Donald Sutherland is the kindly father trying to salve over the open gap that the death of his son has left in their family, yet overlooking the ultimate wound that keeps reopening as his surviving son is rejected by his mother again and again as he remains silent.So much dysfunctional emotions are analyzed by Judd Hirsh as Contrad's psychiatrist trying to jolt his patient from his depressed state and self loathing for all that is not perfect in his family's personalities.

I noticed a number of reviews mentioning that the film was a fine drama and, despite some well-deserved praise, it shouldn't have won Best Picture over ""Raging Bull"". I would've agreed with that statement if I thought ""Raging Bull"" was the best movie of all time. As two stand alone movies, both are outstanding movies. Arguably, some other movies released in 1980, that were as strong, if not stronger, include ""The Elephant Man"", ""The Stunt Man"", ""Melvin and Howard"", ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Oh, the tragedy of a movie being chosen as Best Picture.I was impressed with ""Ordinary People"" when it was first released in 1980. And after over 20 years, it still has an affect on me. With the exception of ""Quiz Show"", I don't believe Robert Redford has directed a movie with such care since his debut with ""Ordinary People"". The movie had some powerful, ground breaking performances by Oscar winner Timothy Hutton, nominees Mary Tyler Moore and Judd Hirsch and non-nominee Donald Sutherland. (I still find it somewhat tragic that Sutherland didn't get the kudos he deserved for what I believe was his best performance of his career.)This might be unintentional, but I believe ""Ordinary People"" presents a powerful message of how important it is for families to communicate.

How she's portrayed makes no sense.We never learn why the mother ""is unable to love"" as the father accuses her of in the end. And when he hits her with that blow of an accusation, she just
packs her things and leaves the house....and the film is over. WHY?!We never get to see her defend or explain herself. She's obviously very deep in grief for her dead son, but the movie seems to imply that her feelings and grief don't matter as much as the men's.I was waiting for the mother to visit the psychologist and have a scene where she finally unloads her feelings and we can finally be able to understand her, see her defend herself, but the character is never given that chance and that's so wrong.We never get to know the mother at all and that pretty much destroys the whole movie, because the viewer wants to see this character open up with her grief, yet she's never allowed to. Why? Are we supposed to just hate her?It seemed like the movie was slowly building up to a watershed moment between the mother and son, but it never came and therefore the whole film was a giant letdown. At the end she just hops in a cab and abandons her family?! I don't believe she would've done that and it's incredibly disastrous writing as well as a cop out.It's astounding that this hollow film was hailed as best picture of the year. It's slow, boring, the scenes are not cohesive to each other and it portrays a grieving mother as a monster incapable of loving anyone in the world but her dead son.Mary Tyler Moore was a good actress, but she should've passed on this plodding drivel.",Ordinary People
107,jbartelone,Excellent Dysfunctional Family Drama,9,16 January 2007,"This is a movie that works on so many levels because of the fine acting by most of the characters. (See exception below) Timothy Hutton, Mary-Tyler Moore, and Judd Hirsch deliver their richly emotional performances, which made Ordinary People the well-deserved Oscar winner.My only problem with the movie is Donald Sutherland's portrayal as Calvin Jarrett. While well-meaning and sensitive to the tragedy of his family falling apart, Calvin is seen as SOOOO weak that a strong wind would blow him over. As a consequence, Sutherland's character becomes more of a ""wuss"" than the sympathetic and concerned father that Robert Redford wants him to be and is demonstrated in Judith Guest's outstanding novel on which Ordinary People is based.In rare instances where Calvin does show backbone in this film, it becomes forced and superficial as if the scriptwriters and Redford wanted Donald to ""Get angry or yell on cue in this scene here."" (Because the lines in the script require you to do so.) Calvin's mood swings seem forced, whereas the other protagonists act very natural and real. This prevents the film most of the time from disintegrating into soap-opera material.SPOILER ALERT: It's almost surprising that it took the death of Buck for Calvin and Beth to drift apart. Given the control-freak that Beth is and her cold demeanor against the emotionally weak Calvin. I could see her walking all over him within months after their marriage and a break-up occurring long before the time mentioned in the film.END OF SPOILER ALERT: However, this is certainly a film with watching and provides many underlining and often times depressing experiences.Note: I changed the rating from an 8 to a 9 on re-watch.",Ordinary People

Nineteen-year-old Timothy Hutton's performance is complete and penetrating, creating as full a characterization as one could imagine. Donald Sutherland's contribution is subtle and painful, a moving dramatic portrait.The Oscars won by Redford, Sargent and Hutton, as well as the Golden Globes awarded Moore and Sutherland are all well-deserved.

The fight between father and mother about shoes just before the ending is a masterpiece. Entire film is a trance like experience with a very emphatic ending. Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore have acted realistically and are flawless. Robert Redford is a class of its own with tight Close-ups and 'Robertish' sound effects. Its his style of film making which is very similar to 'All the president's men' and 'The candidate'. People just call anything poetry. A broad day light scene followed by a night scene with beatle sound is poetic to people. Watch this film if you really wanna know what poetry is.

111,ijonesiii,A Truly Adult Motion Picture Experience...,10,3 December 2005,"ORDINARY PEOPLE was a nearly perfectly mounted, intense, emotionally draining motion picture drama, based on the novel by Judith Guest which was the first directorial effort of Robert Redford, who received one of the film's five Oscars. This deeply moving drama follows an affluent Chicago family, still feeling the after effects of the death of their oldest son, and the guilt the younger son is still wrapped up in, four months after being released from a mental hospital. Timothy Hutton won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his beautifully modulated performance as Conrad, the tortured teen who feels ""onstage"" after returning to school and cannot connect with his mother (Mary Tyler Moore), who he feels loved his brother more than he loved her and Donald Sutherland is the agonized husband/father trying to keep the peace between his wife and son, clueless anymore as how to do so. Judd Hirsch also scores as Conrad's psychiatrist, who helps him to get to the root of his guilt. But what I went away from remembering about this movie was the astonishing performance by Mary Tyler Moore as Beth Jarrett. I never imagined Moore could play a character so icy and emotionally distant...so cold, almost unfeeling at times. Throughout most of the film, she refers to Conrad as ""he"" or ""him"". She never uses his name. She has one brilliant moment near the end of the film where Hutton gives her a hug and she just physically recoils from the touch of her own son. It's a chilling and brilliant moment, perfectly executed by Moore. Sissy SPacek won the Best Actress Oscar that year for COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER, but IMO, there was nothing done on screen by any actress that year that was better than Moore's performance in ORDINARY PEOPLE. She should have won the Oscar and any other awards that were available. Just breathtaking work from a surprisingly unexpected source.",Ordinary People
112,TedMichaelMor,"Oh, just anyway. It's a conversation starter",10,28 July 2010,"Werner Herzog's ""Stroszek"", Wim Wenders' ""Paris, Texas"", Antonioni's ""Zabriskie Point"", and Michael Ritchie's ""Smile"" represent a helpful cross-section of films that depict American life with heartiness, sensitivity, and realism. The best of the lot is Mr. Ritchie's movie.On the other hand, ""Ordinary People"" embodies another vision of American life that is no less insightful than these seemingly more critical films are. Further, ""Ordinary People"" stands well with the film that lost awards to it—the magisterial ""Raging Bull"".""Ordinary People"" has a quiet intensity that might seem to border on sentimentality but, in fact, never becomes over-romantic. It is a film suffused with tenacious level-headedness and minimalism, while the Scorsese film, for all its seeming realism, exploits hyperbole and affectation—creatively and imaginatively exploits but, nonetheless, make use of amplification and elaboration. One must judge ""Raging Bull"" in terms of its aesthetic reality and ""Ordinary People"" in terms of its artistic reality.Director Robert Redford has a sure touch with his outstanding cast. Judith Guest's novel provides a sound foundation for the narrative. Nancy Dowd and Alvin Sargent's screenplay adds depth to the characters. Consider this scene: Conrad confronts his mother with the fact she never came to the mental hospital to see him: Conrad: ""You would have come if Buck had been in the hospital."" Beth: ""Buck never would have been in the hospital."" That is a fine piece of work.The cast is a terrific ensemble. Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Calvin seems essential as a unifying element in the narrative. Mary Tyler Moore's portray of Conrad's mother, finely drawn and, like that of Mr. Sutherland understated performance, ostensively defines masterwork. Mr. Hutton fully earned his Oscar. Judd Hirsch caught what doing therapy is like. His is a fine piece of work as it that of young Elizabeth McGovern, whose future achievement shows clear promise here. Michael Walsh, one of our best American actors, contributes another important support performance.Cinematographer John Bailey, an American trained in Europe and completely at home with European modernism and successor modes of filmmaking, also uses understated means to tell this story. He filmed ""The Big Chill"" and ""Groundhog Day"". Editor Jeffrey Kanew had a light touch that enhances the overall understated tone. I do not understand why his work here received little notice. Composer Marvin Hamlisch echoes the touch of sustained understatement in this work. Some critics question the use of ""Pachelbel's Canon"", also known as ""Canon in D major"". I do not know why. It is perfect.The film is personal to me. I identify strongly with Conrad and see the mother as my mother. Watching this film was extremely difficult for me a long time ago. Watching it the first time, I was interrupted; I was not able to return to the film for almost twenty years.",Ordinary People
113,Katz5,A timeless drama--one of the best films of the 1980s,10,7 August 2021,"1980 was the year of The Empire Strikes Back, The Shining, The Elephant Man, Raging Bull.....a solid year for films, and to this day many movie lovers despise Ordinary People simply because it beat Raging Bull (and even The Elephant Man) and won the coveted Best Picture Oscar that year. But Hollywood was finally connecting with every day American families, as the previous year's ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" examined divorce and the impact that has on a young child, and 1982's ""Shoot the Moon"" (the least known film in this ""family trilogy"") dealt with the infidelities of both the father and then the mother of a large household of teen and pre-teen daughters.The best film of this ""trilogy"" is Ordinary People. In this film, Buck, a popular, athletic, ""all American"" high school Senior drowns in a boating accident on Lake Michigan. His younger brother Conrad takes the blame for the accident. The accident later reveals cracks in the relationship between the father Calvin and the mother Beth. While Conrad grapples with depression and suicidal thoughts, and visits Dr. Berger, a sympathetic psychiatrist, Calvin slowly realizes that his wife is incapable of dealing with tragedy and may suffer from the inability to love. In the end, the film is more a story about the gradual collapse of a marriage that is fueled by a tragedy.Beth is not a horrible person. ""Everybody loves Beth"" Calvin explains to Dr. Berger. A happy homemaker, constantly cheerful, but clearly the only person she loved was her firstborn son, who she lost and yes, indirectly does blame Conrad. Calvin is a tax attorney, well paid and allowing the family to live in an upper middle class suburb of Chicago. He is also haunted by the accident but never blames Conrad, and unlike Beth is perceptive to the fact that their remaining son is in a very dangerous spot - unlike Buck, Conrad is an introvert and locks his emotions up, and already attempted suicide once following the accident.The final passages of this film made me weep more than any other film I've seen in my 50+ years of movie watching. The conflicts in the film are real, and the emotional breakthroughs are so poignant. The acting in the film certainly helps. Timothy Hutton, then a newcomer, won the Oscar as Conrad, but the film really belongs to Donald Sutherland as Calvin and Mary Tyler Moore as Beth. Sutherland spent the 1970s playing outsiders and anti-heroes, and is absolutely spot-on with this performance. A scene where he talks about getting dressed for Buck's funeral contains some of the best acting he's done. As for MTM, at the time she was known for her television work as perky wives (The Dick Van Dyke Show) and single women (her own popular TV show of the '70s). The world had not seen Mary Tyler Moore play this complex character - alternately unsympathetic and tragic, seemingly incapable of dealing with reality.This does not take the acclaim away from Hutton, who is so good as the troubled Conrad. He takes you on a quite a ride with his portrayal and you're right there with him. Certainly deserving of the Oscar, and it's unfortunate Hutton couldn't land a role as good in later films (although he came close with ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" five years later).Judd Hirsch as Berger won an Oscar nomination, and like MTM, at the time Hirsch was mainly known for this TV sitcom work as the calm center of the storm in ""Taxi."" From the very first moment we meet Berger trying to fix his stereo system in his office during Conrad's first visit, we like him. He's compassionate, empathetic, tough when he has to be, always there (meeting Conrad late at night while Conrad has a devastating setback), and in the end simply Conrad's friend.Even the actors in the supporting roles are at the top of their games, and would later prove themselves as assets to other movies. Elizabeth McGovern as the kind classmate who would have the makings of a perfect girlfriend if things were not so rocky for Conrad; Lee Grant's daughter Dinah Manoff as Karen, a cheerful friend who Conrad met at the hospital following his suicide attempt but seems to be hiding her pain; and Adam Baldwin as one of Conrad's swim team friends.Robert Redford made his directorial debut with this film, and his style is thoughtful and not show-offy. This is a delicate drama and he treats it as such. The movie poster summed this film up perfectly: ""Some films you watch. Others you feel."" Spot on.",Ordinary People

He spent time in a hospital after attempting suicide and he isolated himself from friends and family. His father (Donald Sutherland) suggests he go to a therapist (Judd Hirsch). His mother (Mary Tyler Moore) has no connection or bond with her son. This movie is heart wrenching and has amazing performances from the whole cast, especially Hutton and Moore.

In this haunting, lyrical adaptation of the novel, we watch as a seemingly perfect family unravels before our eyes after a tragedy strikes them. Watching them cope, and in some cases, not cope, provides the thought provoking story of this award winning movie.The Jarretts seemed to be the perfect American family, until they lost their elder son, Buck (Scott Doebler, seen only in flashbacks), in a boating accident. Younger son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), has such a case of survivor guilt that he attempts suicide. As the film opens, this has all taken place already, and Conrad has been released from the mental hospital he was placed in after his suicide attempt. He is trying to resume his life with his parents (Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore). This is proving difficult for him as his mother favored Buck, and seems unwilling to forgive Conrad for surviving where his brother didn't. His father is caught in the middle, trying to give Conrad the support he needs, while dealing with his wife, who simply wants to blame Conrad for all of their troubles. Added into the mix is Conrad's therapist (Judd Hirsch) who helps the boy deal with his conflicted feelings.Everything about this film is superb. The writing peels away at the layers of the story like an onion, finally revealing the tragedy at the heart of the story, and the ongoing tragedy of one whose refusal to cope with the situation holds back all of those around her.The film is beautifully shot, each scene allowing time for the audience to absorb what has happened before moving on to the next.The performances are superlative. Judd Hirsch provides an excellent portrayal of a caring counselor who helps Conrad forgive himself. Elizabeth McGovern gives a sweet performance as Conrad's love interest. Donald Sutherland excels as the father who wants to keep his family together, only to realize it can't be done, and a painful choice must be made. Mary Tyler Moore gives a stunning performance as a woman whose warmth to those outside her family is matched by her coldness to her surviving son. Moore manages to make Beth human rather than a caricature, giving the film a richness that adds to it immeasurably. Carrying the film is a young Timothy Hutton, whose pain is practically palpable, and whose personal growth at the end has you cheering for him.A haunting film, which stays with you long after the last frame has faded away.",Ordinary People
116,Jetset971,Its all in the casting.,9,4 April 2011,"This is such a powerful family drama. I have watched over and over again and I am amazed at how many pitfalls this movie could have fallen into but managed to avoid. The plot involves a family coping with the aftermath of the elder son's death from a boating accident and the grief stricken younger brothers suicide attempt because of it. This movie could have been handled poorly by giving into melodramatic clichés but doesn't for two reasons. First, the masterful direction of Robert Redford and secondly and more importantly, three principal actors at the top of their game. I will celebrate them each individually.Donald Sutherland. Plays Calvin the patriarch of the this upper middle income family who desperately wants to keep his dissolving family together but doesn't know where to even begin. Despite his vigilance he always seems to be the last to realize what the others are all too aware of. He has an epiphany speech at the end of this movie that is so moving and sad you cant help but sympathize with the man.Mary Tyler Moore. The wife and mother that seems to have everything under control on the surface but is just using that as a facade to mask how unable she is to show any genuine affection for her remaining son. This is due to the fact that she had invested all of her love and feeling into the older son that died. Moore is flawless in her delivery of this empty shell middle aged woman that has nothing left inside to give to anyone.Timothy Hutton. I saved the best for last. Hutton's performance as the guilt ridden and shattered remaining son, Conrad, is truly one of the best performances I have ever scene. He doesn't come off as overly morose or pitiful but as someone that just wants to be let of the hook from his brothers demise. He feels that his having survived went against the natural order. That his bother was the obvious favorite and therefore he should have been the one to drown. A lesser actor could have easily overplayed this with false sentimentality but Hutton brings far more to the table. He doent just break down into tears every scene but has a wide range of emotions to explore as he sorts out this terrible ordeal.I don't want to neglect the other actors like Elizabeth McGovern and especially Judd Hirsh as Conrad's psychiatrist, Berger. They bring a great deal to the movie as well. All and all see this movie. It will not disappoint.",Ordinary People
117,gbrumburgh,"Superb, beautifully-crafted study of familial loss and repression.",10,15 March 2001,"A trenchant, emotionally-charged story of an upper-scale suburban family (father, mother, teenage son) detached by tragedy, trying to come to terms with the loss of an older son/brother years ago - each in their own, different, self-destructive ways.An Oscar-winning directorial debut for actor Robert Redford, he shows startling aptitude and intelligence for this delicate genre, anchoring the drama with four masterful performances.  Purposely bathed in a quaint, tranquil New England setting complemented by a soothing, reflective score that belie the ensuing conflict, the central family seems almost cushioned by an eerie normalness as they blindly go through the motions of everyday life again (attending civic functions, community plays, business luncheons and swim meets), but things are getting worse.     Donald Sutherland offers one the most subtle, multi-layered performances of his career as Calvin Jarrett, a caring but unassertive father trying to hold together the remnants of a family unit ripped apart after the drowning death of Buck, their beloved son.  Sutherland is all pallid restraint as he resigns himself to quiet despair, running out of answers.  It's a soft, unflashy side we seldom get to observe.  Likewise Mary Tyler Moore, in an astonishing, about-face career move, who tosses her sunny TV disposition by the curbside as Beth, the poised, orderly, emotionally void matriarch whose strong outer facade masks a deep well of insecurity and denial.  Putting on a pleasantly composed front in spite of the family ""mess"", she has buried every ounce of feeling and passion with her dead son and now lives on a cool, private, impenetrable reserve, refusing to allow or even acknowledge the need of outside help for her or her family.  Cal's climactic late-night spill of emotion and Beth's near-breakdown scene is jarringly effective, almost intrusive.  Director Redford deserves special kudos for these two bold casting choices.Judd Hirsch as the sobering, confrontive psychiatrist who tries to get through to Calvin and Beth's remaining son, a potential suicide, is a strong and convincing presence here.  Hirsch gives the melancholy film a positive boost as he resorts to assorted tactics in trying to steer the teenager toward a healthy closure.   But it is Timothy Hutton as Conrad, the sensitive, saturnine son, who is the primary focus here (despite winning a ""supporting"" Oscar), a disheveled, unresponsive shell of a boy isolated by guilt who succumbs to suicidal urges to quell the pain.  As the idolizing younger brother who bears heavy remorse for a boating accident that took his popular sibling's life, Hutton gives full dimension to Conrad, wringing truth out of every frame  especially when he unloads at an intense midnight session at his psychiatrist's office.  Hutton has never been better.  Several lesser roles lend considerable poignancy to the proceedings. Elizabeth McGovern (film debut) is warm and touching as Conrad's high school classmate and possible date material who becomes a catalyst for Conrad in rejoining the human race.  Dinah Manoff makes her one scene  memorable as a former patient also on the mend from trying to ""off"" herself, whose actions indirectly sets Conrad on a road to recovery.  M. Emmet Walsh as a hard-assed swimming coach and Frederic Lehne as a concerned once-tight school buddy, make the most of their small scenes.  The ending is touching and hopeful but still uncompromising, with some family members making breakthroughs, others not.  Anybody not moved to tears by this extraordinary ""Ordinary People"" must have a heart of stone.  A ""Best Picture"" winner in 1980, it is a rich, unforgettable experience.",Ordinary People
118,bedazzle,"a few thoughts, questionable ending",8,24 June 2001,"First off, the modern counterpart to ORDINARY PEOPLE is GOOD WILL HUNTING, not AMERICAN BEAUTY. While both OP and AB deal with suburban angst and unfounded stereotypes, these aspects are only ancillary with OP. OP's main theme could accurately be described as a template for GWH: a horrible tragedy and the resulting guilt prove to be obstacles regarding fulfillment of a young man's potential, and the following conclusion. GWH spends more time on humor and developing the love relationship, but it is the type of tragedy and journey of the protagonists that brings this difference about; GWH is not a better movie because of this. Both movies follow the consequences of their stories and are thus great movies in their own respects, and their common respects. GWH and OP could be described as ""psychological movies."" The main characters are behaving in unconventional ways and it is the movie's job to explain these disturbing quirks. SPOILERS: Con has to overcome his guilt over the death of his brother; while Will has to overcome his guilt regarding childhood abuse. OP transcends GWH in that Con's father has some overcoming do to himself. He must come to grips over his wife's newfound lovelessness. In the end, both Con and Dad triumph. Con handles his depression and Dad takes a break from his deteriorating marriage. This is where the questionable ending comes into play. Having the mother leave fits well with Con and Dad's struggles, but contradicts the general tone of this psychological movie. With Mom's departure, a contributor to Con's guilt disappears, as well as the disappearance of unneeded anxiety concerning Dad. The problem I have with this ending is that the movie goes to great lengths to explain Con's and Dad's problems, while leaving Mom's basically untouched. The idea that Buck's death has something to do with her lack of emotion is touched on, but it is the solving of the problem which is what is needed in this type of movie. So, the ending basically says, ""Mom JUST is that way. The only solution is to stay away from her."" Seems contradictory, is there any reason for this besides the fact that it fits in with Con and Dad's journies? A convenience ending is below this movie.
Overall, still a good movie for its time, and even the present time.8 of 10.",Ordinary People
119,jillbeckinheim7,Powerful film.....,7,4 November 2021,"Powerful film about dysfunction in families. Indeed, throughout the late 1970s and 80s we saw a number of reactionary films which portrayed women and mothers as ice-cold, callous workaholics who turned their backs on their families and abandoned their children (""Kramer vs Kramer"", ""Terms of Endearment""?). The woman was now ""too busy for family"", leaving a gap which the man/husband promptly fills, thereby revealing himself to be super-capable in even traditionally domestic roles; the man is thus simultaneously more effeminate and more masculine than woman can ever be, whilst ""she"" remains exclusively ""the enemy"". As all these films ignore naked economics - the very engine which pushes women into the workplace and neuters both men and women (in a very real sense, it was debt that got women into the workforce and war which put them in trousers and turn-of-the-century factories) - and the various social factors which shape gender and behaviour, their politics are more pointless than illuminating. Cold women? Sensitive men? Who cares. Today both are perhaps representative of nothing more than the triumphs of niche marketing. What's wrong is reducing sex and gender to socially sanctioned codes to be obeyed and then ignoring how external factors relate to, parasite off of and shapes these codes in the first place.Regardless, ""Ordinary People"" explicitly deals with men ""talking"", ""emoting"" and ""working things out with communication"" - traditionally feminine realms - whilst women take the traditionally masculine way out by bottling emotions up and running away. No surprise, then, that ""Ordinary People"" famously beat Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" to the Best Picture Oscar finishing line. This is ironic, as ""Ordinary People's"" explicitly about a family opening up, talking about and confronting their problems, whilst ""Raging Bull's"" lead character is an inarticulate goof-ball who is a seething, violent cauldron precisely because he cannot face or articulate his anxieties. Indeed, ""Ordinary People"" has a raging bull of its own: young Timothy Hutton who flagellates and punishes himself very much like Scorsese's Jake Lamotta.",Ordinary People
120,severindringel,"A very realistic and heartful film, which is passed its time",7,15 March 2021,"Robert Redford's directorial debut promptly won him the top prizes for Best Director and Best Picture at the 53rd Academy Awards in 1981. Until then, Redford had been known for his acting performances. He finally shook off his reputation as a pretty boy with Ordinary People. The film tells the story of the Jarrett family, shattered after the death of their eldest son and the subsequent suicide attempt of their youngest son, who try to deal with their grief in a variety of ways.Timothy Hutton won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the son Conrad, who has just been released from a mental institution, although he is actually the central character of the film. Especially at the beginning, he appears in almost every scene and the tragic events are told from his point of view. From the beginning, he has a hard time finding his way in his new, old life and you always have the feeling that he could fall off the wagon again. From a point where he realises he wants to get his life under control, his parents come to the fore. Donald Sutherland as father Calvin and Mary Tyler Moore as mother Beth could hardly be more different. Calvin is an eternal optimist who talks everything up even after such a tragic incident, but in reality is very worried about his stricken son and the family. Beth, on the other hand, is trapped in a bubble where she detaches herself from any emotional attachments and acts cold and emotionally unavailable towards Conrad in particular. The character is by no means a sympathetic one, but Moore's acting is so close to reality that you can relate to her perverted way of grieving and loving. Sutherland and Moore have the chemistry of a couple growing apart, as you see so often in real life. But the best chemistry in the film is between Hutton and Judd Hirsch as Conrad's therapist Dr Berger. Initially rather toxic, the internally broken Conrad confides more and more in his helper, whereupon a genuine friendship develops. The interplay between friend and psychotherapist seems relatable at all times due to Hirsch's authentic play of a tough but fair mentor.The great strengths of Ordinary People are its outstanding cast and the realistically written script. The dialogue and sometimes monologues get to you and sometimes even have unexpected wit, which does the devastating plot good. For his first directorial effort, Redford has also shown a good hand. Instead of telling a melodramatic family drama in a suburb, he has chosen the subtle way and taken the necessary time for all essential characters. This tediousness also hurts the film, especially in the first half. It's hard to get into the story and the build-up seems tough, which means that the plot only affects you to a limited extent at the beginning. Towards the end this improves and the final act is as heartbreaking as the whole film, but is well and adequately chosen. Overall, Ordinary People is not a film that stands out nowadays, but for its time it was a hit in terms of realism, grief processing and family and group dynamics.",Ordinary People

122,Theflyace,An Impressive and Affecting Family Drama,9,1 November 2013,"Ordinary People is one of those movies where you think it'll be one thing, but turns out to be quite a different experience altogether. Coming from the very well written novel by Judith Guest, and adapted by Oscar winner Alvin Sargeant, this movie very much deals with the harsh reality of a post-tragedy family in America. With great acting, and a very impressive directing debut from Robert Redford, it became something more than a cheap drama a lot of people think it is at first glance.The story centers on the Jarrett family, consisting of Calvin, Beth, and their second son Conrad. Their eldest son, Buck, recently drowned in a boating accident and Conrad is still reeling from both survivor guilt and a recent suicide attempt. Both Calvin and Beth are trying to keep going through life and take care of their remaining child, but also try to comprehend what they are actually like and if they really care for one another. Conrad seeks help from psychiatrist Dr. Berger, who helps Conrad to deal with his still festering grief and his seemingly abandoned feeling from his mother.The acting is truly noting short of excellent in this film. There is not one false note in the list. Donald Sutherland gives a truly fine portrayal of Calvin, who really is trying to connect with Conrad, but doesn't quite know what Conrad wants or how to assert his opinions in arguments or even see what Conrad is feeling even though its in front of him. The fact that he wasn't even considered for an Oscar is truly bizarre, and I see it as one of the worst snubs in Oscar history. Timothy Hutton (who won the Supporting Actor Oscar) Conrad too is complex. he is trying to deal with his grief, but with the world at school who see him as a freak both in general, and after his suicide attempt, it doesn't help his cause. But with Berger, he works through defense mechanisms and vague desires to the root of the problem. We both laugh and cry during his journey throughout the film, which is always interesting.But the most complex of the characters in the whole story is Beth. She is played by comedienne Mary Tyler Moore who completely breaks that mold and shows of her very good acting skills here. Beth is the one everyone loves and likes being around, and a kind of person who keeps up the appearance of both a loving mother and a good housekeeper. But as the film progresses, it seems that she really doesn't love her son Conrad, and even her own husband. She seemed to pour all her energy in Buck, who many saw as the other version of herself. There is one heartbreaking quote about her character during an argument with Conrad and Calvin. Conrad shouts that even though she never visited him in the hospital she surely would have visited Buck, with her responding, ""Buck would have never BEEN in the hospital."" Even at the end when Calvin questions her love for him, she breaks a stoic exterior but immediately puts the mask back on, revealing a very broken and vain woman who wants everything to look good, even at the cost of love and connection with her family.Both Sargeant and Redford do not use drama and the occasional slip into the melodrama for the sake of doing so, but because it helps tell the story and reveal the motivations and idiosyncrasies of the characters. There is no special music or camera tricks to emphasize anything, making the movie seem far more natural and pure than anything else. As a great actor himself, Redford knows how to get his cast to react in a natural way, but not appear to be in a movie.Even though many consider Raging Bull to be the biggest pass-over in Oscars, it really wasn't looked highly upon as a movie back then and this movie was selected for Best Picture, and Redford beat Martin Scorsese for Directing. I see both of them as equal, just on a different level. I consider them both to be the Best Pictures of 1980. I also wish that Mary Tyler Moore won Best Actress, she so deserved it.This movie is a fascinating character study of ""ordinary"" people put in a situation which is a far cry from something remotely ordinary in life. Each deals with it in his or her own way, which leads for some touching and affecting moments, and an ending that seems open-ended in one way, but closes the book in another.

It even features a scene with the angry young son acting out and running away from everyone, right to his psychiatrist. Classic ""After School Special"" fodder.

124,Doogie D,fine debut film,8,26 June 1999,"Adept adaptation of Judith Guest's novel.  Redford works in a somewhat muted way, all for the better: the slight, pat moments (especially between Hutton and Hirsch) have more weight than they probably deserve.  Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland, cast against type, are superb; when oh when is Sutherland going to be recognized by the Academy when he acts well? Hutton and Elizabeth McGovern are each terrific as well.  Only Hirsch seems to be coasting -- or at least, he doesn't deviate from what we already expect from him.  Good photography, and some outstanding scenes.  Moore's character, Beth, is absolutely unaware of her own evil, and it's a real evil rather than a cardboard movie knife-wielding evil; she cares about pretense and how things ""seem,"" even to the expense of her own humanity and the souls of those around her -- almost like a much, much darker Willy Loman.  It is a remarkably courageous performance, and she sticks to it clear through the end; Moore never once lets the audience know that she -- the actress -- is on to her character and above it.Not the best-made movie of the year -- yes, that goes to RAGING BULL -- but that brings up a fascinating comparison: I would suggest that ORDINARY PEOPLE's Beth is all bull in the china shop of her family's hearts, more of a monster than LaMotta who 1) repents; and 2) is not encouraged by society friends to remain unchanged, who perceive that nothing is really wrong. By giving us a real contrast to this monster (especially as Sutherland's character undergoes transformation, waking to a woman he realizes he never knew), the film is ultimately more edifying, entertaining, and life-informing than Scorsese's directorial masterpiece, which ultimately teaches us more about film than people.

126,gooseshaw,"Not perfect, but pretty great considering the circumstances.",8,28 May 2020,"The subject matter of this movie is difficult to depict. Still, this particular film did it pretty well. I felt for the characters and connected with them in various ways. There are a few powerful scenes that brought tears to my eyes. But there were others that just felt mishandled, to put it bluntly.""Dated"" might not be the best term for it, but it's all I've got right now. Again, this subject matter is serious, but because of its age, the film suffers and it becomes more difficult to take as seriously as it should be. The script is one part of this problem. Some of the dialogue is just unrealistic or silly. I think most people who've dealt with these things would be able to recognize the lack of rawness in some of these scenes.I haven't read the book. There are elements of this story that, in my opinion, are cheapened by certain details that I can only assume come from the source. The story is about depression, and the process that the family goes through in order to cope with an attempted suicide. Adding a sub-plot about a brother who died, and connecting it to the protagonists mental state, cheapens the depression itself by treating it as a reaction to an obviously horrific event, rather than as a spontaneous/genetic mental illness.The film is called ""Ordinary People,"" and while depression is unfortunately rather ordinary, the other elements of this story are not. It's almost as if the writer has some sort of disconnect with the average American family, à la John Hughes.Also, depicting the subject as an upper class person, who soon manages to find a romantic partner, trivializes the problems that the protagonist faces. This isn't to say that wealthy people or people in relationships can't have depression, obviously. I only think that those things detract from the subject at hand, and distance the average viewer from the protagonist.There are however certain subtle elements of the writing and performances that were quite real. I don't want to get into details, but the passiveness of Conrad's mother and her inability to recognize signs in her husbands, her sons, and her own behaviour, are some of the most true-to-life, and often ignored experiences I've seen depicted in film.The performances were quite good. Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore especially. The friction and confusion caused by the situation are again, raw and real, and can be easily recognized and related to by the viewer.While I had my problems with the movie, it's still a terrific film, especially given that it takes on the challenge of depicting serious subject matter in a serious way.",Ordinary People
127,Drewboy-2,"In THIS film, the ""foul"" language is a part of LIFE",10,2 March 2003,"I must respond to the comment recently made regarding the use of profanity in ""Ordinary People"".  Remember that this movie was made in 1980 - it is now 23 years old.  I was 19 when it came out, having recently lost both my parents and struggling with the grief that covered my life.  For its time, this movie was EXTREMELY realistic - the ""R"" rating was exclusively from Conrad's outbursts with, not directed at, his therapist.  Much of it was his own anger against himself, his guilt for simultaneously loving, yet hating, his idolized brother.  When profanity is merely inserted into a movie a certain number of times to drive up a rating, increasing its market appeal, it makes the movie trashy.  But ""Ordinary People"" showed us the real depth of pain in Conrad's soul, and that is why it won Best Picture and Timothy Hutton an Oscar.  Even today, it chills me to watch Beth react so coldly -
A person in this much pain in a therapist's office will do anything at first to appear normal, especially a young person.  Could we reasonably expect Conrad, in the moment of crisis during the last 30 minutes of the film, to stop and say ""oh no, I can't say that - it's bad!""  I don't think so.I do agree that many movies today HAVE deliberately inserted profanity to gain a bigger market.  But ""Ordinary People"" wasn't one of them.  I would suggest, though, that children under 13 or so not be allowed to see it because it could frighten those younger, even today.",Ordinary People

Judd Hirsch plays Dr. Berger, the psychiatrist who helps Connie.Calvin is trying to understand why Connie tried to ""off himself,"" while Beth is strangely aloof.

131,svikasha,A Remarkable Film About Mental Illness and Normalcy,8,8 June 2017,"Contrary to the title, ""Ordinary People"" is about a teenager named Conrad Jarrett and his dysfunctional family who find relief in a talented new psychiatrist who goes by the name of Dr. Beger. The first part of the film takes place in Chicago while the latter portion takes place in Houston. In the broader context, one cannot help but admire how well ""Ordinary People"" captures the 80s. The American suburbs today look largely the same as they are portrayed in this 1980 film even after almost 40 years have passed. The sports oriented culture remains. The country clubs of the elite continue to reside in isolated affluent neighborhoods. Although the world has changed a great deal since the 80's, if one wants to truly vision what a suburban family tried to look like at this time, this film offers a rare and poignant glance. However, keeping up the appearance of normalcy can take its toll on a family.That is the main underling problem with the Jarretts at the opening of the film. Conrad is the surviving son in the Jarrett family, who's eldest son died in what is revealed to be a sailing accident. Conrad had just attempted suicide. After a stay at an institution, he begins to visit Dr. Beger who helps the adolescent overcome his clear post-traumatic stress disorder and survivor's guilt. Thanks to Dr. Beger's kind attention, Conrad's father is also able to reconnect with his struggling son and the two form a unique bond that eventually comes to heads with Conrad's mother. Conrad's mother is more concerned with maintaining a sense of normalcy and decency than confronting the dark events that happened to her precious family. This conflict of values serves as the culmination of this fascinating film that properly addresses mental illness at a time when it was not so openly discussed. It is easy to see why ""Ordinary People"" received so much critical acclaim, including four Academy Awards, two of which were awarded to Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton. Robert Redford won an Academy Award for best director thanks to this film. It essentially launched his career as an extraordinary directorial debut. ""Ordinary People"" is an important film because it confronted the misguided nature in which many American suburban families approached mental illness at the time. However, the enduring legacy of ""Ordinary People"" indicates that maybe mental illness will always be misunderstood in some way. Not much has changed. People will always attempt to appear ""ordinary"" for their neighbors without truly understanding what the word even means. After all, if it is true that mental illness affects a great majority of families at one point or another, is it not ordinary? The most powerful moment in the film happens at a McDonalds where Conrad begins to describe what it feels like to endure suicidal depression. ""Uh  I don't know. It was like  falling into a hole. It keeps getting bigger and bigger and you can't escape. All of a sudden, it's inside  and you're the hole. You're trapped. And it's all over. Something like that. It's not really scary  except when you think back on it. 'Cause you know what you were feeling'"".",Ordinary People

I remember my mother was worried about me being such a fan of the film, thinking at the time that somehow I equated her with MTM's character's emotional problems (I didn't, of course). If anything, I was jealous of Sutherland's rendition of a father (I had a male version of Beth for *my* father). I just got done watching it again fully 25 years later and it packs just as big an emotional punch as it ever did, perhaps more for me now that my parents are gone and even this painful glance into family life in the '80's brings on more than a little nostalgia for me (even the clothes, the music, the language...the cars! - all remind me of my teens).

Ordinary People can put it in the final classification, because when I'm writing this I think of some really memorable scene within the film and I don't remember any specific that has impacted me, but I may say that history is well made because the intent of Robert Redford, as director of the movie, is met by a simple way showing that the common life is also full of drama and that ordinary people also suffer, laments and dreams with a happy life.The problem with this film lies at times because in some moments is too slow the characters evolution and the moments of crisis takes a lot to appear, something that happens in real life but would have been helpful for the public if everything had happened so more agile. Another detail that for me seal the film is the three main performances because there lies the story, unfortunately, although Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler plays at the level it needed to move feelings, one like the comprehensive father who fights for being a happy family and she like the mother who blames her son for the death of the firstborn, but not happens the same same thing with the Jarret's son, played by Timothy Hutton, whose acting, or rather say over acting, makes the impact on the death of his brother less credible and transforms the film in a soap opera.Even with some details the balance is tilted more toward the virtues of the film that makes enjoyable the drama of real life.",Ordinary People
134,sublime501,Top-notch acting.,8,14 June 2004,"ORDINARY PEOPLE, based on the novel by Judith Guest, is about a family in ruins after the eldest son Buck (played only in flashback sequences by Scott Doebler) is killed in a boating accident. The other son, Conrad (played terrifically by Timothy Hutton), attempted suicide not long after the accident, and left his mother Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) and his father Calvin (Donald Sutherland) lost and unsure what to do to help the family anymore. That is, if anything can be done at all.The story of ORDINARY PEOPLE is very troubling and sad, but it's really the acting that makes the movie as good as it is. Timothy Hutton is excellent and truly gut-wrenching in his role as Conrad, showing more emotion and range in one movie than most actors could show in three (and at the mere age of 19). He was definitely deserving of his Oscar. Mary Tyler Moore is wonderful as well as the cold, unforgiving mother, managing to be perfectly despicable but still sympathy-provoking. Donald Sutherland takes a bit of a backseat to his co-stars, but still delivers a strong and emotive performance. Judd Hirsch is also good in a more minor role as Conrad's psychiatrist, Dr. Berger. This film is one of those rare cases in which the movie overshadows the book, and this is due largely in part to the acting.However, although the acting is top-notch, that's not to say that this movie is perfect. The directing, screenplay, and cinematography are all wonderful, and there are many moments that are heart-breaking and poignant. But there are also several moments that are rather... well, lame. The scene in which Conrad sings, ""Hallelujah,"" for example, is cute at first, but a little too drawn-out, as is Calvin's jogging scene. The use of flashbacks is also very overdone in this film, occurring either with voice-overs or actual footage. Sometimes this technique is used well and appropriately, like when flashbacks involving Buck or Conrad's friend Karen (Dinah Manoff) are shown. But sometimes the technique is out of place and unnecessary altogether, like when Calvin is running and reminiscent voices go through his head. That's my main complaint about the movie.However, ORDINARY PEOPLE's strengths outweigh its flaws by a long shot. It's a good old movie with excellent acting, wonderful story-telling, and a troubling plotline. But it's not quite the powerful tearjerker it could have been. 8/10.",Ordinary People

On the other hand, it's an absolutely soul-sucking depression fest. In what I guess amounts to high praise for her action ability, I hated the mere sight of Mary Tyler Moore by the end of the film.The storyline is not terribly deep. An upper-middle-class family in the Midwest loses one of their two sons in a boating accident. The resulting survivor's guilt of the other brother drives him to attempt suicide. After the unsuccessful attempt, he's hospitalized and - while making his re-entry into ""normal"" life starts seeing a shrink.The mother - played by Mary Tyler Moore - is very distant and cold to her surviving son (the deceased one having been her favorite) and eventually her lack of concern for her son drives a wedge between her and her husband (Donald Southerland). The plot is very realistic as is the acting and dialogue. But the result of all the well-done film making is a work that will likely bum you out for the whole day - if not the week.I've seen it twice now, once when it premiered, and now just a day or two ago. The first time I was out on a date with a pleasant young lady, but after the movie we couldn't even talk to each other, and I dropped her off at home, never to see her again. The other day when I watched it again, thinking I must have misjudged it, I was so depressed afterwards that I couldn't get out of bed the next morning.So, if you're in the mood to see a well-made, tremendous downer of a movie, I highly recommend this one.

140,tupungato,Great representation of a challenging subject,10,2 July 2007,"Back in 1980 when I first noticed that someone had made a film version of the highly-regarded novel Ordinary People, I felt especially interested in seeing Mary Tyler Moore play the part of the mother, Beth Jarrett. Like many other viewers, I guess, I associated Mary Tyer Moore with her comedic television roles of Laura Petrie (Dick Van Dyke Show) and Mary Richards (The Mary Tyler Moore Show). I couldn't easily imagine her (though Mary Tyler Moore apparently could) in the serious role of a sophisticated wife to a successful tax attorney and of a deeply troubled mother to two boys victimized by the same tragedy.Mary Tyler Moore's acting in an unfamiliar role -- superficially invulnerable but internally agonized -- did impress me, though ironically it also represented, in my opinion, the film's only fault. In reaction to a teenager who, within less than a year, has seen his brother drown and has survived a suicide attempt, the other characters, especially adult friends of his parents, could have expressed themselves a little more sympathetically, while still showing their reluctance to broach the topic of Conrad Jarrett's attempt to kill himself. The support that character Conrad Jarrett does not receive, however, actor Timothy Hutton (in a lead, not a secondary role) does, from actors who, like Mary Tyler Moore, show their versatility. Donald Sutherland, an atypical, if not a little eccentric, soldier in such films as Kelly's Heroes, Mash, and The Dirty Dozen, does a very touching job as an exemplary businessman and genuinely concerned father; and Judd Hirsch, the nonchalant, down-to-earth member of the otherwise wacky staff in the television series Taxi, comes across just as credibly as the astute, controlled yet compassionate, and very professional psychotherapist.Other significant members of the cast, too, demonstrate their skill. E. Emmitt Walsh, the insensitive swimming coach; Adam Baldwin, a mean-spirited classmate and fellow swimmer; Fredric Lehne, the conflicted longtime friend; Elizabeth McGovern, the unconditionally kind love interest; and Dinah Manoff, the disingenuous acquaintance from the hospital, each becomes the individual s/he portrays in this nearly flawless movie.",Ordinary People

A young man dies in an accident and his brother and parents try to come to terms with it and live life. But each of them has a different approach to 'dealing with it'. And as the film unfolds we learn more and more about these people and the strength (or weakness) of their relationships with one another. For me the film doesn't end on a happy or sad note. It just ends a few months ahead of where it started in terms of the timeline of the lives of these people. For the brother, the few months bring about a better understanding of who he is as 16-17 year old. He discovers issues buried within himself, some involving the brother's death but some that are just triggered by it. He confronts them and come to terms with them, in the process learning to love himself and forgive himself for things he cannot change or control.For the parents it brings about issues that seems to have been lurking around for a longtime but since these mature adults fulfill their expectations as model citizens in their community, they never address expectations of themselves or of each other.

The oldest son recently died in a boating accident in which the younger son feels responsible for, so much so that he attempted suicide and was just recently released from the hospital. Also, the mother doesn't show affection for her son as the older son was clearly her favorite. And the father desperately is trying to keep his son happy and his family together. As the movie progresses we see each member of the family try to cope with their problems in their own way and try to get back to an ordinary life.Timothy Hutton does a magnificent job at portraying the son who only wants to know that his mother loves him. This is a very good first directorial effort by Robert Redford, as it tugs at your heart and really makes you think twice about how you treat people. I must warn that it is a pretty depressing movie, but is important as it shows the importance of showing your feelings and not holding them inside.

144,erose001,One of the finest - if not the finest - movies of the 1980s,10,8 January 2005,"An amazing movie from the first year of the decade, by a director in an unparalleled directing debut. I've always enjoyed Robert Redford more as a director than an actor, and when this movie came out, I remembered being very dubious about seeing it. (Word of mouth at the time was pretty amazing, though, and that's what prompted me to get over it.) But once seen (and re-seen several times), I have made a point of catching all of Redford's directorial efforts and I'm rarely disappointed.I won't rehash the plot, others have done a good job of that, but I will say that this is much more a character study of a family than it is plot-driven. So many character studies are somewhat contrived (""Rosebud"" anyone?*), but this felt so *real*, real family dynamics, real behaviors, real reactions and interactions. And the simplest subtlest scenes tell most of the story. For example, pay attention to a scene early in the movie between the son, Conrad, and his mother in the upstairs hallway. The attention to detail is stunning, and yet barely noticeable unless you're looking for it. All you know is that you have suddenly grasped a whole new level of understanding about these characters. Mary Tyler Moore is, if you'll forgive the cliché, a revelation. Especially for those of us who grew up with her sitcoms.That said, as the plot does unwind through the experiences of each family member, it does ultimately pack a pretty hefty emotional wallop, as in the kind you thought you should have seen coming, and didn't. It still gets me every time.This movie doesn't get nearly the attention as a ""classic"" that it deserves.

From the opening shot of the lake, more meaningful for those not viewing the film for the first time, somberly presented with the delicate first notes of the Pacobel Canon. Then the picturesque scenes around Lake Forrest in all it's Autumnal glory, as the music gradually builds. A perfect upper-middle class neighborhood, with perfect houses and perfect lawns. But we soon learn that all is not perfect in this scene as Redford cuts from Conrad Jarrett singing with the glee club, to Conrad Jarret suddenly sitting bolt upright in bed, gasping for breath and drenched in sweat. The cause: his brother died in a boating accident, after which Conrad tried to commit suicide.A few scenes later Redford tellingly begins the breakfast scene with a shot of Beth's hands setting glasses of orange juice on the table - first two glasses set down together, then the third glass very deliberately placed on the table by itself. In this simple gesture we get an immediate sense of Conrad's feelings of isolation, even in his own home, and Beth's idea of his position in the family. It is in this same scene that we first witness Beth's callous attitude toward her youngest son. The way she immediately takes away his French toast when he says he's not hungry, not even giving him a chance to change his mind, and brusquely shoves it down the garbage disposal. When her husband Calvin protests she coldly tells him, ""You can't save French toast."" Possibly a metaphor for how she feels about her damaged son. Then comes the condescending attitude, when she asks him if he wants her to sign him up for a golf tournament. He says, ""I haven't played in a year."" She counters with a judgmental, ""Don't you think it's time you did?"" In other words, Beth thinks it's high time her weak son got over his suicidal angst. In this deceptively simple scene Redford neatly sets the tone for the 3 main characters: troubled, isolated Conrad; supportive, puzzled Calvin; cold, unfeeling Beth.The acting is brilliant. Hutton is easy to identify with as Conrad. The scenes where he courts Jeannine Pratt ( an engaging Elizabeth McGovern) show his warm and endearing side. He also skillfully captures Conrad's emotional turmoil. His scenes with Dr Berger (Judd Hirsch) show great range and depth. Their emotional breakthrough is honest and touching (and, by the way, copied almost shot-for-shot in the film ""Good Will Hunting). Donald Sutherland hits the right notes as Calvin Jarrett. His big emotional scene at the end rings true precisely because of his steady, supportive characterization throughout the entire film. I love the scene where he talks to Beth about the day their son died. Hirsch is also quite good as Conrad's psychologist.Top acting honors, however, must go to Mary Tyler Moore as Beth Jarrett. It would be easy to have Beth become a stereotypical monster mother whose rigid, demanding, unloving personality have probably contributed as much to her son's mental state as the family tragedy they have endured. But MTM's Beth isn't one dimensional. We see her warm moments, mostly with her husband and in a couple of key flashbacks. She's that good friend you think you're close to, but not really. Moore has so many great moments in the film. The scene with Conrad in the backyard, when she tries to draw him out, then quickly retreats when he mentions his dead brother. There's the picture-taking scene, which begins like a Kodak commercial, endures a blow-up by Conrad, and ends with the unflappable Beth casually saying, ""Smile"" as she snaps a picture. There's the big Christmas tree scene, where it becomes obvious that one sure way to draw Beth's ire is to let a friend find out personal family info before she knows about it. I also love the scene where she has lunch with Calvin in the department store. They're discussing private family business when a waitress intrudes. The way Moore cuts off her sentence, gives the waitress a curt, superficial smile, then resumes her sentence after the waitress leaves, is shear genius. But my favorite scene is the big golfing blow-up, where we see Beth go from being a lucky golfer to a screaming harpy in a matter of seconds. You have to feel sorry for her brother, Ward, when he steps in and tells her everybody just wants her to be happy. He should know better, having grown up with Beth. Her scathing reply make it clear she knows a lot about being unhappy:""Happy? Ward you tell me what's happy? But first you better make sure your kids are safe. That none of them have fallen out of a tree, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that pool you're so proud of! Then you come to me and tell me how to be happy!""I think Mary Tyler Moore gives a near perfect performance in ""Ordinary People"". With apologies to Sissy Spacek, MTM deserved the Best Actress Oscar.One criticism of OP that I've heard is that it ends too neatly. Their complaint was something along the lines of, ""Not every kid gets better."" I don't see how this applies to OP. Sure, Conrad was helped by his therapy, and at the end of the film he is ""better"", though I get the sense he is far from healed. As for his family, it has been devastated AND strengthened at the same time. OP is a hopeful film that deals with complex issues in a very satisfying manner. I think it has aged well over the past 30 years, and it still ranks as one of my favorite films of all time.",Ordinary People
146,yaseminturkish,Ordinary in depicting American family degeneration but Extraordinary in being the best film on the topic,10,16 April 2002,"The debate regarding how Raging Bull should have won the Best Picture Academy Award over Ordinary People in 1980 apparently has more to do with how poorly received this masterpiece is than what a lasting effect it had. Perhaps many viewers just couldn't sympathize with what I think is a typical problem in American families that our mothers and fathers disagree and often play favorites with their own children.  Inevitably someone will be left out and if it's you, a tough road lies ahead.  Ordinary People is a vivid portrait of this reality and it's fair to assume that Terms of Endearment, The Ice Storm, and American Beauty would not exist without it's critical success.  Ordinary People defined the American family genre and gave it the strength to march on.  Looking back on the last twenty years I can say with ease that while Ordinary People pre-dated it's present counterparts it remains the absolute best of the family genre films.  It did not require strange speeches about masturbation and over-acting by Annette Bening (American Beauty) to get it's point across.  It rose above the abyss of the TV-movie that defines Terms of Endearment.  It did not require an ice storm (reliance on plot over character) to show how unfeeling the characters were (The Ice Storm).  Instead it delved into the hearts and minds of every character and trusted enough in it's actors to rise above the top-notch material they were given to work with.  It all began when Mary Tyler Moore appeared on the screen and I thought to myself ""This will never work, she's Mary Tyler Moore for goodness sakes!  We adore her and she is always incredibly funny.""  Was I ever wrong.  I thought back recently to all of the incredible roles we have watched that merited Academy Awards for leading actresses.  Mary Tyler Moore puts to shame the other best performances in Oscar history, Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice and Vivien Leigh in Gone with Wind and Moore never even won.  What was so incredible was her resolve to play this difficult role as mother Beth Jarrett straight and unphased, she never smiled unless with Donald Sutherland in a scene and even when Timothy Hutton reached out to her as Conrad, the way she looked at him with so much hate said more than 1000 words could ever say.  What made the role so amazing was the ability by Mary Tyler Moore to relentlessly say with her face what her mouth could not find the words for.  And Moore did it all so effortlessly and chillingly without breaking a sweat.
  Donald Sutherland has been vastly under-appreciated in his role as father and husband.  I have always been fond of his work in Ordinary People because that guy is my own father and I believe countless fathers in the United States.  He's a tax attorney that like a lot of baby-boomer dads let's his son make mistakes and go on his own path, but is there for him no matter what he does.  While Beth Jarrett breaks down because of the embarrassment that she believes the family will incur from Conrad's suicidal tendencies, Donald Sutherland acts as a life-preserver for the sinking ship that is his son's life.  He can take it because for goodness sake this is his son, and he just doesn't care what the neighborhood will think.  His ego in this pursuit is at direct odds with Beth Jarrett's and it ultimately tests the marriage.  Not enough praise can be given to Sutherland in this performance.  Certainly much ink has been spilled about Timothy Hutton in his break-out performance and first feature film and his Academy Award was very well deserved.  There is something very significant about a boy so cut off from real society because of his mother's behavior that he is forced to get her attention through extreme measures.  When Conrad tries to be the adult and dispel Beth's embarrassment about the entire situation he is shot down and he finally realizes it is all too late.  Even more sad is when his mother plays favorites and consistently shows that her love lies in the grave with her deceased son.  Sadly enough, she fails to realize that you should always love your children equally and at the very least, realize that you have a younger son left who is dying to be your favorite.  This is so true of real-life.  Many mothers and fathers ponder the misfortune of having stillborn children and children who died before they did.  They spend so much time stuck in this phase that they neglect to realize that they have a child whose alive and well and needs attention.   The film could have degenerated into a sweet hug-fest of an ending but completely refuses.  Too dark for some but very significant for me.  And did I mention that Robert Redford effortlessly directs his first feature and deservedly wins at the Oscars?10/10",Ordinary People
147,KMR,Sudden bursts of emotion,10,9 December 1999,"I love the way the fragile veneer of civilized politeness gets stripped away over and over again throughout this movie, as the upper middle-class, ultra-WASP characters find themselves unable to hold their emotions in check any longer.  The excruciating embarrassement and shock felt by everyone in the aftermath of these outbursts is palpable.  I think Timothy Hutton gives the performance of a lifetime; I don't know anyone who didn't relate to his portrayal of Conrad Jarrett in this film.

150,luke-31,Deserved Every Award It Got-But MTM Was Robbed!,10,4 March 2003,"""Ordinary People"" is an extraordinary film. It completly deserved all its awards. Even though it is not a happy movie, it is a life affirming one. Timothy Hutton deserved his Oscar as tortured teenager, Conrad Jarrett. He might just be the very best of the best supporting actors. Donald Sutherland was completly snubbed by the academy, which was a real shame. His confused father, Calvin Jarrett, is probably his most nuanced and heartfelt performance.But the real Oscar tragedy was the loss of Mary Tyler Moore to Sissy Spacek for best actress. Moore deserved that trophy. Her emotionally crippled mother, Beth Jarrett, the organized, efficient epitome of suburban perfection, shocked moviegoers everywhere with her uncompromising performance. Although the film is built around Hutton's character,any discussion of the film will quickly go to Moore and her performance. Spacek may have been playing a real person,but Moore was playing a complicated, often nasty character, and she did so with unflinching bravery. The award should have been hers. One of the biggest mistakes in Oscar history, as far as I'm concerned.Using Canon in D as background music was a brilliant idea, as well. All the elements come together to make ""Ordinary People"" one of the finest films of all time. Definitly on my top five favorite movies of all time list.",Ordinary People
151,RJ-21,How wrong I was...,8,3 May 1999,"I expected to hate this movie.  I'd heard bad things about it - it was an Academy movie, it was boring, it was crap....  It was on at 2am here, so I set the video to tape it.  I watched it soon after, and I was shocked how good it was.  The first part of the movie is, admittedly, a little slow, but after that it's brilliant.  Tim Hutton is wonderful as Conrad, although it seemed to me that he was just about the lead actor and not supporting actor. (still, I like the fact that De Niro and Hutton both won Oscars that year) Redford does an excellent job (except for the first few shots...they DO look more than a little pretentious.) as a first-time director, making the film as a whole a great experience.  8 out of 10",Ordinary People
152,editguy,Emotive and explosive,8,12 August 2006,"""You can't handle mess,"" Donald Sutherland tells Mary Tyler Moore. That's the theme of Robert Redford's masterpiece. A somewhat earthier way to put it is the well known ""S**t happens."" Indeed it does. This movie explores what happens when a wealthy, successful but repressed family has to deal with it.Timothy Hutton turns in the best performance of his career as Conrad Jarrett, youngest son of Calvin and Beth (Sutherland and Moore). Conrad's older brother Buck has died in a boating accident, one that Conrad has survived. Conrad is all but consumed by survivor's guilt, and has just rejoined his family in tony Lake Forest, Illinois, after hospitalization following a suicide attempt.Hutton and Moore give electrifying performances as the son who desperately wants reassurance and acceptance by his loving but emotionally crippled mother. Beth (Moore) can't let go of her beloved eldest son's memory, and regards Conrad's pain and feelings of guilt as weakness. Sutherland is wonderful as the kind but ineffective Calvin, who can't quite get a grip on what's happening around him. Though his performance is spot-on, Sutherland gets blown off the screen by Moore and Hutton.Conrad finds refuge in the office of Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch, who uses his impeccable comic timing to maximum advantage as a sardonic shrink). Berger helps Conrad to acknowledge his pain and feelings of guilt (and frustration with his parents), helps him to feel acceptance of the situation, if not approval. This upsets the dysfunctional balance of the family, however, and the outcome is not surprising but still painful.Redford focuses the camera like a laser-beam, and the result is totally believable. It would have been far too easy to go over the top with any of this movie's themes, but Redford always modulates the character's emotions down to a WASP-y, clenched-teeth ferocity. No one except Conrad actually loses his temper or shows raw emotion -- the others suck it in and pretend that all's right with the world, when it's clearly not.There was some grousing after this movie won Best Picture in 1980, but after one viewing I think that any sane person would agree with the accolades.",Ordinary People

I found the film extremely boring and just begging for it to end after the first half hour. I kept waiting for in to get interesting or more intense but I didn't seem too till to late and I had already given up on the movie. Not the mention the fact I can't believe the mom just got up and left. I really just didn't enjoy the story or the plot, on the other hand though I though the director did the best he could with such a slow boring story. The actors all were excellent and Timothy Huttons character really did a great job. He truly made you believe that he was this unstable kid dealing with lots of issue's because of his brothers death. There were great use of lighting but as in some of Robert Redfords other films; it was just to long and slow. I would recommend this film to my grandmother but never to one of my friends.

156,giffey-1,Still the correct choice for Best Picture of 1980,10,17 May 2013,"I have watched and enjoyed this film many times since it premiered in 1980. The story of a family who has been wracked by tragedy and would give anything to be ""Ordinary People"" was a controversial choice for Best picture in 1980. Many people believed Raging Bull to be the better choice. I can understand people's feeling about that, but to me it is the argument that invariable comes at Oscar time that a more ""audience friendly"" I. E. escapist or ""Popcorn"" film should win over the movie that, however well made, can seem too difficult to watch and absorb.Maybe my feelings about the movie come from an empathy I have for Conrad, brilliantly played in his screen debut by Timothy Hutton. Having lost the brother he idolized in a boating accident that happened due to carelessness, he now tries to struggle with his feelings of a responsibility that is misplaced, and a mother who has seeming buried all her feelings and maternal instincts with a first born who was her whole world. His father is concerned and possibly over protective of the boy and gradually comes to understand what is happening in his family. The final scene between the mother and father, where the Father realizes that the woman he married and the woman he is now talking to is not, in fact, the same woman emotionally, is as terrifying as any horror film.The entire cast deserved awards. Donald Sutherland was not even nominated for what I believe was his finest performance. Mary Tyler Moore used the lessons of her own life to play a woman who rigidly holds herself and her family to an impossible standard. Judd Hirsch was a revelation to me at the time this film was released as I was only familiar with his TV sitcom work. All four of these people usually get glowing reviews for this film. I also would call out Elizabeth McGovern, as the pretty yet sensitive student whom Conrad is rapidly developing a friendship with. To me, she was never better.This is a film that needs to be seen. All families are really like this in some ways, striving to be ""Ordinary People"", but knowing they may never make it.",Ordinary People
157,Spider-52,Sheer emotional power and a brilliant Timothy Hutton propel it into greatness.,10,15 August 1999,"Watching ""Ordinary People"" is an ordeal in itself.  The film, about a family being torn apart by the death of its elder son, is the very definition of heart-wrenching.  Timothy Hutton gives an astonishing performance as Conrad, the remaining child and sole survivor of a horrible boating accident.  Although Hutton's role was the main character, he was nominated for Best Supporting, not Best Actor.  I'm glad the Academy did this, however, as both he and De Niro deserved Oscars that year.  Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore are also excellent in the roles on Conrad's parents, and Judd Hirsch is wonderful as the psychiatrist Berger, who teaches Conrad to forgive when he needs to most.While ""Raging Bull"" is inarguably a better film, ""Ordinary People"" beats it out in sheer emotional intensity.  This--and Timothy Hutton's incredible performance--will ensure that ""Ordinary People"" is always remembered as a great film, even if not the greatest of 1980.",Ordinary People
158,Andrew-162,Could be best of 80's,10,30 November 1999,"Ordinary People vs. Raging Bull. It's hard to decide which should've won the best picture oscar, because they both worked on different levels. Raging Bull was excellent, framed by the DeNiro-Pesci-Scorcese team that made Goodfellas and Casino hits. However, though it was powerfull, the emotion that was put into Ordinary People and the emotion that it gives off is stunning.         Calvin and Beth (Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore) live in a quiet town, have high social position, and are well off. The perfect life,right? Not even close. The two of them and their son Conrad (Timothy Hutton) have been at their emotional breaking point ever since first born Buck drowned at Conrad's fingertips during a boating accident. Conrad has just attempted suicide and is always on the edge. Beth is completely unreachable and just wants to go on as though it didn't happen. Calvin is just the block between the two of them, preventing them from further emotional breakdown and trying to get the family together before they  shred each other to pieces.       The performances are all around excellent. Sutherland gives an emotionally trying performance as the string that pulls the family together, Moore gives a completely turned around performance as the cold and evil Beth, and Hutton is oscar-worthy as Conrad (he justly won an oscar for it) Go out and see this movie, you won't be dissapointed.",Ordinary People

The sound of the choir still gives me the creepsranked up there with the disturbing yawns of the Amityville Horror. Hutton plays a young teen named Conrad, who is coping with some ""miscalculated"" guilt over the death of his brother (during a sailing trip). Moore and Sutherland play his grief-stricken parents. If you suffer from bi-polar disorder or smoke a lot of pot DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. The suicidal themes are well-portrayed and the background score only amplifies the extent of human depression.

161,severin72,One of the greats.,10,11 January 2007,"Robert Redford's debut as a director really is that good. From Judith Guest's novel about an outwardly prosperous American family struggling with the loss of the beloved older son Redford, and screenwriter Alvin Sargent have crafted a beautiful ""actor's film"". This is not in the sense of a ""Glengarry Glenross"" where there is a pervasive theatrical sensibility and all is driven by the dialog. Many of the finest touches here are unspoken. It's the best-case scenario for a film directed by an actor (and one of under-rated talent at that). The performances are flawless all around. If top honors are to be awarded they might best go to Moore. Playing against well established type she crafts a superbly observed and all too believable character; a woman who has let her visceral habit of self-protection get so out of control it has utterly crushed her humanity. Hutton (who won an Oscar) and Sutherland are also superb as the the husband and surviving son, the other two legs of the highly unstable familial tripod. Look also for fine supporting work from the likes of James Sikking, Elizabeth McGovern, and M. Emmet Walsh. I confess to being a complete stranger to the milieu of the American preppy class (how ""ordinary"" are these people? I don't know anyone with a live-in maid.) but the representation of them and their world seemed, to me at least, meticulously realized - right down to maybe the most extensive collection of sweaters ever assembled on screen. Redford's done some good work since but with ""Ordinary People"" he started off at the top and found there was only one place to go. No matter.

164,MISSMOOHERSELF,SHATTERING,10,22 October 2004,"The perfect life of the perfect family is destroyed when the older of 2 sons dies in a sailing accident, leaving the parents and his younger brother to grieve, pick up and carry on. But how they accomplish this makes this movie a shattering but ultimately uplifting (in parts) experience.Buck Jarrett drowns after he and his younger brother, Conrad, go sailing on a questionable day. Later, Conrad, feeling the guilt of his brother's death, tries to commit suicide by slashing his wrists. This turns out to be a blessing in disguise because the true personalities of his parents, Cal and Beth, as well as his own ability to grow are revealed when Conrad returns from the psychiatric hospital after a 4-month stay.Conrad is given the name of Dr. Tyrone Berger, a psychiatrist (marvelously played by Judd Hirsch) who is unconventional to say the least. He dresses casually, drinks coffee he makes in his office and smokes incessantly (this is pre anti-tobacco). And he doesn't buy into the psychobabble practiced by many psychiatrists. At first, Conrad tells Dr. Berger he wants to gain control but what he really wants is to not feel - not feel the pain of his brother's death and what he believes is his part in it. But that unravels through a series of experiences he endures as the movie proceeds. In choir practice, Conrad is smitten with Jeannine Pratt (beautifully played by Elizabeth McGovern), a fellow singer who has an ability to recognize Conrad's pain without being amazed, horrified or judgmental. And Conrad also has a friend, Karen, (played nicely by Dinah Manoff)whom he'd met in the hospital and who can relate to his experiences there.Donald Sutherland as Cal, Mary Tyler Moore as Beth and Timothy Hutton as Conrad give outstanding, Oscar-caliber performances. Cal tries to keep his feelings hidden by wearing a mask of bravado, carrying on and functioning in a world that has taken his son away. He loves Conrad and also recognizes his pain and his alienation fom his mother though he realizes he can't ""fix it."" But it's Mary Tyler Moore's performance as Beth that is so amazing. She is plastic through and through and it gets to the point of being downright annoying and yet MTM's portrayal is perfect. Of all the characters, hers is really the most disturbed. She wants to have things exactly as they were even though she mourns the loss of her firstborn son. She can't love Conrad because he committed the one unforgivable sin - he survived while her favorite did not.Timothy Hutton, sadly, has never had a movie to top ""Ordinary People."" He has done other work, of course, (most notably in my opinion, ""Taps"") and can be seen currently as Archie in ""Nero Wolf"" on A&E. But his role as the troubled surviving son who rises from the pain in ""Ordinary People"" is truly magnificent and shattering. He earned the Oscar and he truly deserved it. And as he accepted his Academy Award, he remembered his father, actor Jim Hutton, who had died from liver cancer shortly before Timothy got the award. That was a classy thing to do. I hope Mr. Hutton gets another plum role like this one; everything else he has done since pales in comparison.",Ordinary People

What is remarkable about this film, besides the superb acting, is how realistic and unsentimental it is. Nothing is romanticized and the film makers do not try and make a happy ending out of the story. The movie is deeply moving because it does exactly what it sets out to do, it examines how depression and death affect an ordinary family.Hutton's performance is extremely compelling, in fact he is remarkable. I was very moved by him, the expressions on his face, the way he carried himself, everything was believable. This simply is a remarkable movie, nothing seems overdone or left out. I can not give any movie higher praise. I am glad to know that there are other people out there who understand depression and death and how they can affect ordinary people.

166,gemini_dremz,A Failing Family Unit,10,17 March 2014,"This film has to be one of the most realistic stories of an American family trying so desperately to ignore it's blemishes, one being the ever so taboo subject of suicide. Poor Conrad struggles so hard to be ""normal"" after his release from a hospital after cutting his wrists in an attempt to commit suicide. He's a teenager dealing with the death of his brother, who happened to be his mother's favorite. What's so heartbreaking is the mother's (Mary Tyler Moore) obvious discontent for Conrad (played brilliantly by Timothy Hutton). It's like she blames him for his brother's death even though it was an accident. The father (Donald Sutherland) is the middleman. He's trying to please his wife and do right by Conrad. He seems to be oblivious to what's going on until his wife's treatment of his son can no longer be denied. It's at that time he becomes even more supportive of Conrad and less of his wife. As a parent it's difficult to imagine how anyone can treat a child in this manner; I absolutely despised her from the beginning. Conrad, no matter how he tries, just can't seem to do anything right and as a teenager (which is difficult in itself), has to live with his mother's hate, blame, his own guilt and shame not to mention not feeling loved by his mother. Conrad finds the help he needs through a therapist (Judd Hirsch). During his therapy, he is forced to face his demons which in the end helps him to move forward.

167,jim6263,Sublimely powerful.,10,24 June 2005,"Sublime in its understatedness, a portrayal of the veneer of propriety as love is ""Ordinary People."" I suspect that its title was intended to be ironical, as, if economic class and privilege were a measure, this family should have been above such harsh realities of ordinary life. Survivors of such ""love"" may prefer to have been pummeled by Jake LaMotta!? One recovers from such -- usually, anyway. Not so with the agony and emotional loss of subtle parental neglect, indifference, and/or worse! It may not be as cinematically dazzling or as gritty, but it is righteously the better drama and Best Picture winner, as was Redford's direction.

I'll leave it to them to give you more details. This has to be Mary Tyler Moore's best performance. Confronted by the death of her favorite son, she just can't cope with her loss. An absolutely brilliant performance by this actress.I consider movies to be great when they ask questions that we'd really not want to answer, or hadn't thought about. This movie does that.

170,pinkpanther1164,Mentally Riveting,8,8 May 2010,"Ordinary People is a film Directed by Robert Redford about one family's struggle with the death of their oldest son, and the attempted suicide of their other son. This film was released in 1980, when the world was different and families were very conservative. The family portrayed in the film was upper class citizens with 2 teenage sons. The eldest was killed in a boating accident right in front of his younger brother. Buck was a star athlete and the apple of his mothers' eye. When his death happened, it affected each remaining member of the family differently. The mom became aloof and distant, the father was in denial and Conrad tried to take his own life. Conrad was a troubled adolescent that knew he would never compare to his brother. As the film played out, the mother confirmed his thoughts by basically not acting like a mother at all. As Conrad tried to carry on with his life, he struggled and decided to seek professional help. His father supported him, while his mother was embarrassed. She felt as though this truth was something that needed to stay within their home because their ""friends"" wouldn't understand and secretly judge them. This was a slow paced film, but was very deep with the points that it made. Death and psychiatric help are tough issues that people have trouble admitting when it hits too close to home. This film forced you to emphasize, but in a way that was enjoyable and entertaining.",Ordinary People

The list gave me a warning about the novel that it contains mature issues such as suicide. I read the book and saw the movie and it was painful to see what Conrad went through with his cold hearted mother and all Conrad wanted was love from both of his parents. It made me angry how the mother was so uncaring and hardly did not want anything to do with her son. I have known people in the past who have treated me the same way and it's very painful to bear.

The casting was spot on if not risky. Donald Sutherland like Redford was a Hollywood Megastar himself and proved again how fine a actor he was. Mary Tyler Moore a TV Megastar in the comedy genre proved she could translate perfectly in drama. Judd Hirsch another TV superstar again in comedy shines bright and right out of the gate was Timothy Hutton who took a good role and ran with it. Elizabeth McGovern another first time actress was actually still in acting school and was granted leave to make the movie. The rest of the cast was stunningly fantastic.A story of a upper class family in suburban Chicago has everything they need to live their happy life in their happy town in their happy house. In reality (in the movie) they are falling apart and crumbling. Mary Tyler Moore gives a performance of a lifetime as a cold bitter mother to her youngest son who survived a boating accident that claimed the life of his older brother. Timothy Hutton as the younger brother is trapped with survivors guilt and blames himself for the tragic event. Between Tyler Moore and Hutton the audience feels the coolness as they wither through each emotion flawlessly.Donald Sutherland gives an equally stunning performance as the father trying to keep his family together and try and figure out how to return to happier times. Communication between he and his wife is poor and that alone pulls them apart. The one who has to piece this all together is the family doctor played brilliantly by Judd Hirsch, he sense's the problems fast and uses his own techniques to patch up the son.In all this is the best movie I have ever seen that never grows old and after 41 years is still as powerful as ever. Sadly the two main cast Tyler Moore and Hutton never got another role as strong as this and their careers never grew bigger. I cry each time I watch this movie cause it's so accurately made and is storytelling at it's best.During the Oscar's that year Mary Tyler Moore, Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch received nominations for their work. Donald Sutherland was snubbed that year as the movie won best picture, director (Redford), supporting actor (Hutton), writing and editing. Only two of the five actresses were top favorites that year, Sissy Spaces (Coal Miner's Daughter - Loretta Lynn - winner) and Mary Tyler Moore (Beth Jarrett) the other three knew they were going home empty handed.I fully recommend this movie to everyone specially to teen's who can see that with the right help and guidance they can overcome what tragic lives deals them. This is one movie I'm proud to own and watch it at least 3-4 times yearly.",Ordinary People
175,Wardman3,Stunning insight into a family falling apart.,9,30 January 2005,"""Ordinary People"" deserved its Oscar. There was such fierce competition in 1980 that winning the award was a real honor. The movie should have shared honors with ""Coal Miner's Daughter"".Having said that, the reality of the movie is so heartbreaking and so real that you feel every emotion and understand the characters feelings, whether you liked them or not. Mary Tyler Moore's performance of Beth Jarrett is so powerful that you forget Moore's comedic repertoire and immerse yourself into her persona as a cold, distant wife that can not show emotion for her son. It is disturbing that Beth can not show Conrad love and it breaks your heart when you see the awkwardness as he tries so hard to get any love or recognition from her. Her breakdown scene at the golf course and the realization at the end of the movie that she is incapable of affectionate love are powerful performances.Donald Sutherland's understated and beautiful performance is brilliant. His making up for Beth's shortcomings as an affectionate human being are so touching. He does all he can to keep the rest of his family together. Why he was not nominated for an Oscar is beyond comprehension.Timothy Hutton absolutely shines as the troubled Conrad. All you want to do is hug him, love him, after his rejections from his own mother. The torture and pain he is in is portrayed so stunningly. His guilt over the death of his brother and subsequent depression are heartbreaking.Growing up in suburban America, the film rings many a truth to the insights of what people perceive as a ""normal family"". The cocktail parties, the school activities, the socialization of Beth and her friends over the recognition of her son do happen in suburban America. Robert Redford recognized every real detail of the facades that people put up and the reality of what happens at home. They are poignantly and chillingly realized.Definitely one of the most deserved Best Picture Oscars given. Please don't miss this one.",Ordinary People
176,randeclip-1,Like a fine wine,9,16 January 2006,"Their world is truly a perfect place; with its groomed lawns and freshly painted homes, and even the people are polite, proper, and happy with life- or so we are led to believe. Robert Redford brings us this perfect world with its perfect people only to show us the imperfections that are so well hidden and are never supposed to be seen. Ordinary People is the story of a families struggle to accept the death of a son and its consequences on all who are left. The main character that is highlighted in the story is the younger son Conrad. Having recently returning home from a mental hospital after an attempted suicide, he is the primary victim of this tragedy. He was on the boat when his brother ""Buck"" drowned, and he blames himself for his death. The parents are almost polar opposites. The father is desperately trying to keep the family together and to understand what is happening, while the mother is seen to ignore everything and continue to uphold all the pretense that is her life. Also featured in this film is Conrad's psychiatrist Dr. Burger who serves as a means of telling the background story as well as to help the family in realizing their true situation. I first saw this film twenty years ago as part of a high school field trip. The theater was filled with high school seniors and we wondered who thought up the bright idea of seeing this ""Boring"" film. This thought went on for about the first ten minuets then we were all engrossed in it. I distinctly remember the gasp of the audience when Conrad receiver the news of his friends suicide over the phone. That gasp was missing in this viewing of the film. I can only attribute it to the age of the audience. The odd thing about seeing this movie after so many years was that the first time I saw it I was seeing it from the son Conrad's eyes. This time I looked at the story and felt more for the father. I suppose age can change a perspective that one views a story from. The gasp was voiced from a room full of Conrad's twenty years ago where this time we were a room full of parents sympathizing with his plight. The ability of a director in being able to tailor a film to his audience, even years later, is a noteworthy achievement. Ordinary People was and still is a great film.",Ordinary People

By the end, our thoughts have been altered a bit and its a film that leaves you thinking.Conrad, played brilliantly by Timothy Hutton in an Oscar winning role, is the depressed suicidal son of a couple struggling to cope with their son's drowning death. Conrad of course feels responsible, and has already tried to take his own life once before.Reluctantly, he begins to see a shrink at the advice of his father. Dr. Berger, also played brilliantly by Judd Hirsch {though there are no slouches in the cast}, helps Conrad through thick and thin. By the end of the movie, the audience truly feels for all characters to some degree.As has been stated, the acting is magnificent. The story may seem simple but this type of film really doesn't need a heavy plot. Its an excellent look at the problems we all face. When I first saw this at a young age I related completely to Conrad's character. When I saw this tonight, I related more to the adults and could really feel for them a lot more than I remembered. Each character has a unique sense of reality to them. The actors really carry the film, making the characters seem like real people we've known for years.Unfortunately this movie has received somewhat of a bad reputation over the years as the film that beat Raging Bull in 1980 for the Best Picture and Director Oscars. While both movies are excellent, its sad that one has to be better than the other and people just don't enjoy both movies for what they are. Many people have preconceived opinions about this 'small' film they have not heard of. After all, Raging Bull is an all time classic.

As a result you are invested in the characters and care about each one which means that when the drama hits in this film it is like an emotional sledge hammer.There are many amazing scenes in this movie, I would love to tell you about them but I dont want to spoil this movie for people , my advice is simple: watch this movie",Ordinary People

I'm 17 years old, about the same age as Conrad, and I just connected so well with the character. Finally, a movie that makes you connect. American Beauty is pale in comparison to this movie. I personally loved the Ice Storm better than Beauty. But, all in all, Ordinary People is better than both. I love character studies, where movies are character based, and that there is pretty much one character in the movie you can relate to. Tim Hutton's Conrad was so perfect, so intensely real it made me sick to watch. Mary Tyler Moore was just excellent,and deserved an Oscar for it. Donald Sutherland played the father so softly and so calmly that at the end when he breaks down, it is so poignant and powerful, you can't help but feel for him. Robert Redford did such a great job at capturing emotions on film, something I think Beauty lacked. That film was more plot based as someone wrote earlier, and I can agree. All I have to say, is that I've found a new favorite film, right up there with Billy Wilder's The Apartment (again a great Character movie) and Fight Club (just an all around great film).

186,Cyrn,Timelessly Haunting,10,14 May 2005,"There's not a false note or performance here! It's quite extraordinary how this is played out. It's quite amazing to see how Conrad keeps everything bottled up throughout most of the movie yet shows so much more under the surface even during these times than the most verbose speeches could have rendered. The thought that came to me about his attempted suicide after his brother Buck's drowning was that it wasn't just guilt that drove him to that but I believe he may have sensed that his mother wasn't willing to love him (her only surviving child) even after that so he may have done it as a last ditch attempt to win her love by doing what he believed she may have preferred all along. Timothy Hutton definitely earned his Oscar here and it was good of him to dedicate it to his late father Jim who became terminally ill with liver cancer during the film's shooting.Mary Tyler Moore played Beth as far more complex and with more depth than she might have been played by a lesser actress. Even though Beth is quite hypocritical- saying and doing many selfish and heartless actions, there IS a humanity in her character so that even when she leaves without so much as mustering a goodbye to her still-fragile son, one can sense that she WILL be missed by both her husband and son even though both have had to come to conclusion that she never genuinely loved either of them. Her scenes with her parents, brother, neighbors and trick-or-treaters showed she WAS capable of having genuine affection for others but NOT for the most important people in her life. Perhaps, Beth feared getting too close to those who knew HER faults all too well. One must ask though, how could Conrad have known that his mother had had to uproot and replace the bathroom sink and tile work because the blood from his suicide attempt proved indelible unless he overheard her or she outrightly TOLD him so?! And then,too, the scene at the golf course when Beth berates Calvin for having the temerity to wonder if the suicidal Conrad was okay and wanting to phone him after so many days alone (accusing Conrad of somehow manipulating his father's emotions for HIS sake ) was quite outrageous as was her chastising Calvin for tactfully imparting the news about Conrad's current therapy to a concerned neighbor saying that Conrad's problems had to stay within the family- yet having two VERY public outbursts about Conrad in front of total strangers! The scenes in which she was discomfited by Conrad's walking into Buck's room as though he had deliberately disturbed her worshiping at her personal shrine and when she utterly recoiled when Conrad hugged her and told her how happy he was to see her were quite chilling indeed. It would have been easy for Beth to been played as an utterly heartless, vindictive witch but, even during Beth's worst, Moore showed us Beth's humanity! It should be noted that Moore now admits that her relationship with her only child Ritchie Meeker was somewhat strained during his teen years. However; they DID reconcile and became close by the time she made this movie and he lived to be her escort for the premiere. The movie must have been quite cathartic for BOTH to see. However; Moore's comfort would prove tragically short-lived as Meeker would die from an accidental shooting at age 24 a few months after this premiered! The late Donald Sutherland as Calvin was perhaps the most compelling of the main roles as he alone earnestly wanted everything to be alright for all members of his family to the degree that he refused to see Beth's flaws until almost too late. Sutherland made him quite believable without having Calvin become 'touchy feeling and overly sensitive'. It should also be noted here that Dinah Manoff shined in her solitary scene as the one-time fellow patient Karen whose suicide would prompt Conrad to desperately seek out help to save himself from his own demons. Karen also faked being cured and happy but the viewer couldn't be fooled by this bravado thanks to Manoff's intensity! It's too bad Manoff has since opted for comedy instead of revisiting her dramatic heights. This isn't a 'chick flick' but one of humanity in all its best and worst. However; the themes of suicide and parental rejection may be too upsetting for small children.",Ordinary People

189,nateromero-83398,Ordinary People,8,11 January 2019,"In a film that has all the makings of the standard coming-of-age drama, Ordinary People tackles sensitive subject matter with poise and a rewarding sentiment.
Mainly following the life of Conrad Jarrett (a powerTimothy Hutton), we watch a a regular, suburban family adjust to normal life after the death of one of their children. We are introduced to a seemingly normal, functioning family with Conrad at its focal point, from the audience's view at least. He engages in normal teenage activities: he rides to school in the backseat of his rowdy friends car, attends swim practice, and goes home to eat dinner with his pristine mother (Mary Tyler Moore) and his soft-spoken father (Donald Sutherland). All seems right on the surface but the film's uneasy tone never wavers as the frailties of the family slowly begins to unfold.
The film moves at a somewhat leisurely pace but it is never tiresome. In fact is effortless and allows each character to reveal their intricacies without bombarding the viewer.
The film deals with tragedy and suicide with care, and does not dwell on melodramatic expose. Each character's insecurity is hinted at but it is never too explicit where the audience need not discover it for themselves. Redford allows the viewer to empathize with each character by their own notion and presents the events in a way that shows without telling.
Much of these emotions and complexities are drawn out by a family psychologist Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch) who operates with a calmness and assurance that couples well with Hutton's performance. Hirsch does a marvelous job here as the seasoned doctor who meets with Conrad and evokes his true emotions about his brother's death not by textbook questions but by establishment of trust and transparency. Hirsch and Hutton work well here and the dialogue is natural and effortless, reminds me of a young Matt Damon and Robin Williams conversing in a similar setting in Good Will Hunting.
Another couple that work well together with matching acting prowess is Tyler Moore and Sutherland. Playing the dichotomous couple who battle between acceptance and catharsis in the face of the tragedy, both actors nail their roles as the conscientious mother who struggles to create an intimacy with her son, and the quiet, agreeable father who attempts to find a common ground between the two polarized members of his family, respectively. Tyler Moore is unforgiving and tragic in her own sense as later scenes in the movie reveal but the film never leans in her favor. Alvin Sargent and Nancy Dowd, who wrote the screenplay, never neglect to give each character their own light and allows each character to operate effectively in separate scenes.
However, the best scenes in the movie I think involve the supporting characters. the most revealing instances are between Conrad and his two female interests. It's here we are able to connect with Conrad and get a real feel for his pain. One scene has Conrad meeting with his friend from the psychiatric hospital Karen (Dinah Manoff) and they share the details of their life after their encounter. We can see Conrad's struggle discern his own condition in comparison to Karen's. We can see for ourselves the insincerity of his upbeat attitude and his attempt at normality. Director Robert Redford helps bring vibrancy to the film and we see a part of the story develop rather than unfold. It's at these moments we understand the struggle Conrad face's with his own emotional turmoil and we can see his only two connections with happiness left; although one character embodies happiness in the past, the other in the future.
At the beginning and end, a version of Pachelbel's Canon rings out; a beautiful, grand composition that works as a synecdoche. To dip into musical terms, Pachelbel utilizes counterpoint, or a feature of music where every section plays their own tune at different times, yet the entirety of the piece sounds in harmony. It's a nice testament to the film, where each roles resonates solo and fortissimo, anchored by the unwavering performances of the cast. Yet the true genius of the film does not just lie in the players, but by the sure-handed direction of Robert Redford in his extraordinary debut.",Ordinary People

The outstanding direction of Robert Redford, and the brilliant acting of Mary Tyler Moore, Donald Sutherland, Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch.This movie is set in suburban Chicago. The family is an upper-middle class foursome, the parents and their two sons. The eldest son, Buck, is killed in a boating accident. The other son, Conrad, survives but is riddled with guilt. His mother, Beth, who idolized her deceased first born, is cold with her surviving son. She looks at him and is reminded of the pain. Instead of nurturing her surviving child she distances herself from him. Conrad attempts suicide and spends time in a mental hospital. Calvin, the understanding father, is torn between his wife and son. Dr. Berger, a psychiatrist, is hired by the family to help the troubled young man. The scenes between Hutton and Hirsch are amongst the best in the movie. He helps Conrad understand his mother's pain and shortcomings and to stand on his own. Conrad tries to keep his family together and realizes, almost with relief, that the family's problems are caused by Beth's ""burying all her love with Buck"".This is a fascinating motion picture.

192,Old_Abe,"Absorbing story, well told.",10,27 March 2001,"Repeated viewings have not diminished Ordinary People's impact for me. Seeing it for the third time recently, I was again thoroughly involved by this story of a family trying to hold together after the loss of a member. Though I've not had to experience a loved one's death, there's still much here about life and family and growing up that is easy to relate to, probably, by anyone.Conrad (Timothy Hutton) is a young high school guy going through a confusing time, and he seems so real and familiar on a gut level that it's occasionally uncomfortable to watch him.  While his story is central, a fair amount of time is also given to the perspectives of his parents, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) and Calvin (Donald Sutherland).  The most common situations - eating breakfast together, driving to school - are at once totally familiar and obvious at first; and yet just as in reality there lurks another life in their silences, in what is not said, and in their body language and choice of words.  You as viewer are invited to read these people; the movie respects you as an active participant, rather than constantly telling you what the heck is going on.The supporting roles are realistic in the same manner, especially Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), Conrad's psychiatrist, who could have easily been just a plot device in a lesser movie.  This one, thankfully, succeeds in giving anyone who wanders onto the screen a fair shake, a real representation.  Conrad's chorus mate, Jeannine Pratt (Elizabeth McGovern) for instance, receives less screen time but still gives every indication of having her own life outside of the events in the movie(even if that life doesn't include practicing her bowling stance). I suppose all the realism in the world wouldn't matter if you didn't want to spend time with these people -- if you didn't identify with them or find a good amount of merit in them -- but I did, and it's likely you will too.Some credit for these strong portayals surely goes to director Robert Redford, whose straight forward, matter-of-fact presentation somehow gives more power to the emotions underlying the story.  As much as I enjoy Scorsese's dynamic camerawork in Raging Bull (another Oscar contender for 1980), I also take my hat off to Redford for his seemingly simple approach. The fact that he lets his camera sit still and allows the actors to ACT earns him my respect and makes me wish more moviemakers would just do this simple thing.  Further, he seems to know how long to let a scene go  he gives you enough of it to draw information about the characters and story, and not so much that you're ever looking at your watch. 
Now I'll leave you with one criticism, which has to do with the story's outcome and not the technical aspects or acting/directing.  (SPOILER AHEAD, skip to next paragraph.)  My girlfriend and I agree that, while it's generally even-handed, the story ends up slightly villainizing the mother, Beth.  Sure, she is (agonizingly) more reluctant to show troubling emotion or to deal with the problems underlying the surface of her relationships with son and husband.  But she is still shown to be a sympathetic, wounded and understandably confused person, and I think her husband is a bit too damning and dismissive of her in the end.  It just seems their relationship is put into more jeopardy than is warranted, given what we have been shown of this couple and their feelings toward each other.  I guess I was convinced they did in fact love one another and could have worked through the situation, and so I was a little frustrated at the possible ending of their marriage.  But maybe the separation turns out to be temporary and mendable, so who knowsOrdinary People is refreshing as a straight drama.  Most dramas made today feel compelled to give us an ironic wink now and then, as if to appeal to our sense of cleverness in case our hearts are not all that engaged by the story.  Ordinary People doesn't wink or blink; it just presents these people and their story with sensitivity and intelligence.   I know I'll watch it again, and I recommend it to anyone.",Ordinary People
193,zbornak,A Psychological Work of Art,10,1 August 2000,"It is hard to believe that this is Redford's directorial debut!   There are lots of movies out there dealing with the human mind and its problems within society and change, but this is THE ONE to watch!  Timothy Hutton, in his film DEBUT, earned a well-deserved Oscar for his performance of the troubled Conrad Jarrett.  Judd Hirsch, his psychiatrist, and Donald Sutherland, his father, give powerful performances and go far beyond the one dimension that these types of characters usually limit themselves too.   But the real gem of the film is Mary Tyler Moore.  Here we see America's Sweetheart, the bubbly little thing that gained laughs from us for years on TV by crying ""Oh Rob!"" and ""Oh Mr. Grant!"", become the stone-hearted woman who never sheds a tear.  We see every inch of her cold soul and identify her with someone in our own families.  It is a real performance and one in which we see that Mary Tyler Moore is indeed an actress of no equal.

Very ordinary movie, brilliantly made, great acting performances, simple yet great script. Its touching. Had watched it years ago but it left a lasting impression.

195,SuperCoop,Ordinary People makes for an Extraordinary Film,10,23 January 2001,"Films have ventured into all sorts of territory they have shown us Wars and the Holocaust, but all of those things have seemed distant to me none of it felt real, but ordinary people feels all too real.  This film is driven by its characters and this film shows them all flawed and troubled in their own ways.  Mary Tyler Moore plays the mother, Donald Sutherland plays the father, and Timothy Hutton shines as their troubled son Conrad who can't handle his guilt over his brothers death, and his contempt towards his mother for not loving him.  Judd Hirsh plays the psychiatrist who helps Conrad come to terms with his life.  The truly mesmerising performance in this film is definitely by Donald Sutherland, the character he plays is one that I have never seen on the screen before, which is a caring father who realizes he has to take control to solve his families coping.  He struggles to keep his family together, and the scenes between him and Hutton are top notch.  We see how he takes pride in his son and isn't ashamed of him like his wife is. The film works together beautifully thanks mostly to Redford's steady paced direction and the vibrant script.  Never has a film felt so real or so honest.",Ordinary People

The characters are not relatable at all and trust me I know from experience what Timothy Hutton's character is supposed to be going through.  Mary Tyler Moore is just out of place as the cold heartles mother. I think a Faye Dunaway or Jane Fonda in the role would have been a better choice.  Donald Sutherland character is somewhat likeable as is Judd Hirsch's however I found Elizbeth McGoverns performance as Jeannie far to over done.  All in all this film is mediocre.

199,Conrad-23,An Extraordinary Film of Humanity: 10/10,10,29 May 2000,"This film, without a doubt, is the best dramatic film I have ever seen. It is truly an extraordinary film of humanity. To start out, the film begins in complete silence and gently flows into Pachalbel's ""Canon in D"". It has become my favorite movie and I can say with 100% certainty that it deserved every Oscar it received. I cannot truly articulate with words what this movie did to me when I first saw it. I had an epiphany-like experience. I was born in 1980 and didn't see this film until shortly after I turned 19. The events portrayed by Timothy Hutton, Mary Tyler Moore, Donald Sutherland, Judd Hirsch, Elizabeth McGovern, Dinah Manoff, and Fredric Lehne are just as powerful and relevant in society today as they were 20 years ago. Timothy Hutton's performance of Conrad Jarrett, an 18 yr-old suffering from depression after the tragic death of his older brother is extraordinary. Being the age Hutton was when he made the film, when I first saw it twenty years later, I related to the emotions on every note. Teenagers are rarely portrayed in film as realistically as in real life. In my opinion, Conrad Jarrett in ""Ordinary People"" is the best portrayal on film of a teenage boy going through the good times and the bad, but mostly the bad.  Timothy Hutton is a truly amazing actor. Mary Tyler Moore also deserved all of the praise and nomination for a role that is literally the opposite of anything she had ever played before. The way she portrayed the cold, cruel, yet emotionally-hidden Beth Jarrett is outstanding. Donald Sutherland and Judd Hirsch also gave performances that made them truly believable as Calvin Jarrett and Dr. Berger. Sutherland should have received an Oscar nomination. Elizabeth McGovern and Dinah Manoff's small character roles as Jeannine Pratt and Karen are just as vivid as in the novel. Jeannine provides the excellent uplift in the story; while Karen provides the semblance of reality that things are not as they seem. Every line and every scene in this film is as detrimental to the overall underlying theme as it is in the novel by Judith Guest. The words ""I love you"" and ""love"" have an immense importance in this film. Kudos to Robert Redford, who shows that he is not only an excellent actor, but also a truly excellent director. The color scheme, music scheme, setting in Lake Forest, Illinois and that ""perfect"" home all provide the exact backdrop to the circumstances going on between these characters and within Conrad himself. This film relies solely on the realistic interaction between ""ordinary"" people living through ""extraordinary"" circumstances. This film had an amazing impact on me and I'm sure it will do the same for anyone else who sees it. If you do not leave this film having gained that underlying insight that this film gives, then you did not truly understand the purpose of the film. You don't have to suffer from depression or go through the loss of a loved one to understand the message delivered by this film. It's definitely more than just a ""tissue"" movie. Truly one of the best films ever made.A 10 out of 10.",Ordinary People
200,kevingi-1,Only Redford could start off behind the camera this way!,10,18 August 2006,"Another reviewer said it best when they wrote that Redford let's the story address its elements, issues and character chemistry in its own time. That's one of the most effective, and ultimately most moving, characteristics of this film - it begins and ends with the ironic name of the film. We watch the lives of a family slowly unravel and re-align, thinking all along that ""it would never happen to us,"" and yet it does, over and over again, in ways both great and small. And that is the strength of this story - that it touches everyone in a way that makes some people uncomfortable, others relieved, and still others enlightened.The conventional wisdom is that someone nominated for a Best Supporting role has one or two specific scenes that beget the nomination. I would submit that for Judd Hirsch, it's the final scene with Timothy Hutton. Conrad is teetering precariously on the edge of his personal abyss once more, crying out for a human touch-point. He wails, ""Are you my friend?"" Hirsch replies, ""I am! Count on it!"" Similarly for Mary Tyler Moore, it's the last line she gets to utter, this time to Donald Sutherland - ""I feel the same way I've always felt about you."" Her portrayal of a woman who can't bring herself to simply love her family, notwithstanding all their faults, is riveting, and serves notice that she isn't ""just"" Laura Petrie or Mary Richards anymore.In my personal list of Top Ten films, this one is #3 (behind only ""The Seven Samurai"" and ""Breaker Morant""). It should be near the top of the list of anyone who appreciates the power of a totally human narrative.",Ordinary People
201,pierre.gautard@free.fr,What Ordinary People is really about,10,25 November 2005,"OP is about the ""social behaviour"" against self. Beth (the mother) does everything as she has been told, she is a social robot: she does not have any insight or questions about herself. Thinks love is about ""behaving like"" (like you're supposed to).So OP questions that (through Conrad and Calvin). So the opinion of the crowd about OP (or another film) is not important. What's important is you make your own opinion. Beth (the mother) is not just cold, she is sick. That's why she is cold. Calvin (the father) goes over the mother taboo and makes the right decision. He saves his son, and their love. ------- People who don't like this film don't want to be contradicted, stirred in their feelings and confronted to taboos: for instance, they think they believe Movies are to be an ""outside entertainment"" with ""outside feelings"". This does not mean OP is not entertaining: it is, in another way. It is a different entertainment from ""Raging bull"" and we can like both of these films. There is no contradiction in this. -------- People who don't like this film are faced with the same kind of problem Beth is up over the head in. Love is superior to taboo. Being a mother (with all the taboos of innocence linked to it) does not free you from this responsibility. Thinking the contrary would be Narcissism (in the sense of a well known borderline mind disorder). This is what happens to Beth and we must praise again the magnificent performance of Mary Tyler Moore!",Ordinary People
202,phillewis91,A hugely influential work,7,23 November 2013,"Directed by Robert Redford, the 'ordinary' people in question aren't actually that ordinary. I think that's the whole point. On the surface, they are your typical well-heeled American family. The house is big but not flashy, the dad (Donald Sutherland) is a tax attorney and the mum (Mary Tyler Moore) is the model of a suburban housewife. Yet, as is so often the case with these suburban family dramas, it's the children who see through the middle-class smokescreen of respectability. Conrad (Hutton) is still suffering from the loss of his brother in a boating accident, and refuses to take part in his mother's increasingly desperate charade. Partly as a result of this, and partly because Conrad is, in her eyes at least, the lesser son, the relationship between the two of them is strained. As the veil of normality slips, all three of them have to truly come to terms with the tragedy that they have so far avoided.It's a slow, brooding film that gradually reveals the extent of the trauma that Conrad is dealing with. Ground-breaking at the time for it's frank treatment of mental health issues and suicide, Ordinary People is a hugely influential work. It's clear to me now where The Perks of Being a Wallflower got most of its inspiration from, along with elements of Donnie Darko, Good Will Hunting and innumerable others. There are, of course, hints of Holden Caulfield in Conrad, yet Conrad has far more genuine cause for a breakdown that Caulfield did.In a film full of sad stories, the saddest is Conrad's mother, Beth. Come the end, it seems that she is the only one without any foreseeable chance of redemption. Perhaps this is because she was hit the hardest by Buck's death, and has the toughest journey ahead of her. It's an incredible bit of acting from from Mary Tyler Moore when, at the end, her mask of emotional repression slips. And it's an unusual scenario - the mother fleeing her family rather than the father.As much as I enjoyed Ordinary People, I would still have given the 1980 Best Picture Oscar to The Elephant Man.",Ordinary People
203,ahab19,Heartbreakingly real,10,28 March 2012,"Ordinary People is a rare and exceptional movie that realistically tackles the dysfunction, pain and lack of communication in the typical American home without resorting to clichés or taking the easy way out with one diensional characters. This film deals with the Jarret family and their attempts to deal with the tragedy of the oldest son Buck, who was killed in a boating accident. The focus of the film is the journey of the younger son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), who is dealing with the pain of survivng the accident as well as an attempted suicide. It is not just Conrad's sorrow over the death of his brother that makes the film exceptional, it is the relationship between himself and his parents, who are also dealing with the fallout of their oldest son's death. His mother Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) is also dealing with the fallout of Buck's death and treats Conrad with a subtle contempt and coldness. His father Calvin (Donald Sutherland) struggles to keep the family together but is unsure how. Hutton's portrayal of Conrad's pain is very subtle and realistic. The overwhelmingness of Conrad's pain is at times difficult and almost unbearable to watch. The sense of his despair, confusion, hurt, isolation and loneliness is the heart of this film. It is also his relationship with his mother that makes this film stand out. In our reality, there are many things that should be that aren't. We like to think that mothers are compassionate, kind and caring. But mothers are human beings too and in Beths case it is clear she is not capable of showing the kind of love and compassion that Conrad needs. It's not that she does not love her son, she is incapable of showing it.A film is only great when it does not take the easy way out. This is a film that takes a painful topic and deals with it in a sensitive way. Alienation and angst during the teenage years is something almost anybody can relate to. Despite finding his strength by looking for it in others, he finds it in himself with the help of his therapist.Conrad's relationship with Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch) is the driving force of his devlopment. Berger's sensitive yet blunt counseling helps Conrad to confront his guilt and shame and begin the process of eventually forgiving himself. He also finds The films ends on a bittersweet note. Enough time has now passed from the tragedy for Calvin and Beth to discuss their real feelings. In a final scene Calvin confronts Beth about his feelings on their marriage.

Not because it is an easy or comfortable film to watch - it is certainly not that - but because it touches the emotions in a believable and honest way.There are no evil villains here - not even Beth, the mother who finds it so hard to express her love for her son - just 'ordinary people', captive to their own personalities and characters who are 'found out' by tragic and unforeseeable circumstances. Nor are there any 'happy endings' here - just a sense that, in admitting the truth, some of the characters may be beginning a new chapter in their lives.Watching this film is an exhausting experience! An amazingly mature performance by the young Tim Hutton underpins an excellent cast and Redford's directorial debut is remarkable.

Timothy Hutton's best performance and this is a far cry for Mary Tyler Moore from her TV show. She had a great performance because it's a great comment on people (in real life)who just close up after tragedy. Moore's character concerns herself with what other people think, instead of devoting her energy toward her family. This seems to happen a lot in real life. Anybody who thinks Good Will Hunting (1997) is a great movie should check this out. This is the original.

However, the 1941 winner was How Green Was My Valley, which is also a great film by a great director. For my money, for a great director/film like Scorcese/Raging Bull to lose to something that is wholly unwatchable---that represented a new height in injustice.

MTM is superb in her portrayal as a rather cold parent, at least with her surviving son. Rarely inquires into his life, no praise of noteworthy accomplishments, little to no physical affection. I do feel she is warm, loving, and supportive of her husband though, plenty of scenes of them smiling, laughing, enjoying each others company. Sure, she's not an earth mother, no loud, affectionate, Italian pasta-making Mama, but she is an upper-middle class, country clubber and given the times, that is the way they were expected to behave.I found this a breath of fresh air in a way, as her husband & father of main character - Don. Sutherland, is the deep feeling, empathetic, loving, and truly concerned parent of a son experiencing severe PTSD and clinical depression. Fathers for the last 40-50 yrs have been maligned atrociously as superfluos at best, beastly at worst. Here, he is observant and accurate regarding the lack of love mom is showing the son.Under the horrific pressure of the son's continued depression/anxiety it becomes more and more apparent that the mother has a severe bonding issue with the surviving son. This in turn begins to damage the marriage, resulting in mom's rather spontaneous departure. It seemed premature and poorly developed as only one severe argument is depicted between husband and wife. The only other hint of marital discord was regarding her deciding his wardrobe on the day of the funeral - and this discussion ends up with her hugging him affectionately in apology.Sorry for such details, but it felt like a bit of a refreshing twist.

It was in 1980, and I was too young to have seen most of the movies which were released, but it's Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton together that makes this movie so powerful. I say screw the over-hyped ad-libbing, somewhat amusing performances in ""Raging Bull"" and accept the fact that in the year 1980, ""Ordinary People"" was actually the better movie. I hate the Oscars, but every once in a while they're right.

215,calcat91355,Quietly heartbreaking,9,15 January 2006,"I saw this movie 25 years ago, and my opinion may be slightly skewed. I was the same age as the character ""Conrad"" portrayed by Hutton and I had some of the same fears and insecurities at the time as his character displayed throughout the film. Although there wasn't any one emotionally devastating event in my life to trigger feelings of guilt, I nonetheless identified with Conrad's lost soul, and the effect on me was powerful. At that stage in my life, I was not one to be moved to tears over emotional drama...until this movie. I fought back the tears over two intensely poignant moments which I would not dare to reveal here.Suffice it to say that over the years, and subsequent viewings, this film continues to hit me in different spots as I relate events on the screen to what I have come to know about relationships. It hits home on so many levels. It seems to be one of the only films to deal realistically with dysfunction in a seemingly ""normal"" home environment. The facade is there, but the truth lurks not too deeply underneath the surface. And, when the truth is finally revealed, it is one of the most simultaneously shattering and exhilarating moments I've ever seen in film.While Conrad's journey to the core of his guilt is the emotional centerpiece of the film, some of the quietly played scenes between Conrad's mom and Conrad are as perfectly played as they are uncomfortable. I cannot remember who won the Academy Award for best actress of 1980 but the Academy made a huge mistake by not bestowing the Oscar upon Mary Tyler Moore. Her restrained frigidity haunted me and had me screaming for her to break through the ice...and at one of the rare moments where she finally does show any depth of emotion, it is a fascinating study of someone who, somewhere along the way, lost her ability to face reality.So many great moments exist in this film, and apart from the emotional turning point about three-quarters of the way through, one of the most memorable moments for me - and one that I can never forget - is a simple scene of a father and son hugging each other.

The different interpretations of the lead actors are wonderful : Donald Sutherland is so touching and Mary Tyler Moore embodies a mother who lost her ""faculty of loving"", If I may say, with the death of her first son. Timothy Hutton delivers a masterly performance at the age of 19-20 of the brother and son, respectively, who doesn't find his way of life since the accident but who begins to integrate in the ""real world"", as it said in the movie, at the end. The fact that the mother leaves the house tears the family.
We cannot suppose if the mother will be able to go back to her husband and her son or if she will not return.
However, the final reconciliation father-son gives a note of hope.

218,ashrich_13,Semiotics,9,21 December 2008,"2. The cinematic codes used in this film were, I believe, the ones that pursued greatly a major contribution to the general theme and primarily created the atmosphere that was appropriate and all-encompassing. Of course the camera work, as I have mentioned earlier, helped a lot in terms of the creation of spatial relationships between characters and also in making good use of the actors' capabilities. But the one thing that stood out in my observation as something that had given a lot of significant meanings all throughout the film was how every shot was lit.It is interesting to note how the lighting changed when two of the major characters, Beth and Calvin, were talking outside the house (when Calvin just arrived from visiting Dr. Berger). They were positioned in such a manner that the light coming out of the door from the house seemed ghastly but cathartic. By this time, Calvin was trying to talk to Beth about Buck's funeral  one of the major things that she was avoiding ever since Buck died. What I thought about this was that the ""exterior"" was lit in the way that only the face of Calvin was highlighted and everything else was dark. Beth was right beside the door and in a few steps, could go to the dark-lit part where Calvin was standing or go right inside the house where the light source was coming from. The significance of this to the general theme was Beth's avoidance of the dilemma represented by her trying to go inside while Calvin tries to force her to talk about it and stay in the darkness. Also, Beth was trying hard to convince him to go inside and not talk. The lighting, in this particular scene, created a two-sided inference of whether the major issue should be confronted or not. This was represented by the dark and the well-lit sides of Calvin's and Beth's and how it opposed and contrasted each other.Also, another group of scenes to note is how Conrad was lit every time he visits Dr. Berger. His first visit, it seemed like additional light sources were used. Fluorescent lights inside Dr. Berger's office and the ones coming from outside the windows highlighted the characters and the set. Conrad was well-lit in this particular scene and it is interesting to note that this created a sort of irony in the sense that his first visit was actually the time where he concealed most about what he feels regarding Buck and his agony towards his death. In comparison to this, the second and third instances of the visits actually made an interesting shift from being well-lit to highlighting only a portion of his face with orange as the dominant colour. The third visit, specifically, was where he was shown lounging on a chair and this was the moment where he tried to open more about his feelings. He was then more comfortable talking about Buck's death and in some sense, he already trusted Dr. Berger. Then in the succeeding visits, it goes back to being well-lit paralleled with his again, trying to swerve from discussing his feelings and actually denying his problem and neglecting the need to confront it. After this, the lighting sort of varies with his decision to open up or deny his inhibitions. Furthermore, his last (and considerably most emotional) visit to Dr. Berger was the most darkly-lit of all instances. This was particularly where he told him everything  about how he felt when Buck died (it was shown as if he was talking to Buck through Dr. Berger) and what has become of his relationship with his mother.",Ordinary People

That's the beauty of this film: the emotions and situations in which we are placed find resonance in the superb acting by ALL the cast.  There have been comparisons to this film and the recent American Beauty, and though I think of Kevin Spacey as one of THE finest of actors, it's an unfair comparison.

This tear-jerker about a family in turmoil is superbly written by Alvin Sargent. His adaptation of Judith Guest's bestseller added more emotional depth and realistic dialogue to provide extreme credibility to the story.The acting is exceptional. Timothy Hutton's performance of a young man struggling with the guilt of surviving is heartfelt and real. Mary Tyler Moore, who is more accustomed to playing more emotional roles, does a fine job as a mother who is almost incapable of displaying affection after a personal tragedy. Donald Sutherland's portrayal of a father who is trying to keep his broken family together is earnest and impressive. The best performance must have come from Judd Hirsch who plays a sharp-tongued psychiatrist, Dr. Berger who tries to explain to Conrad (Hutton) that its acceptable to feel pain. In the most poignant scene of the movie, Conrad doubts the goodness of life, but Berger reaffirms its goodness. When Conrad asks how he knows this, Berger simply replies, ""Because I'm your friend."" Good acting does not come without good directing. Robert Redford handled Sargent's script beautifully and brought career performances from each of the four main characters.

Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2017
When this film was released in 1980, I was 19 and I was a projectionist at a theater in Mobile, Alabama. Back in that time, the movies were delivered in individual reels (6 to 8 depending on running length) and it was the projectionist's job to splice the reels together for the film to be loaded onto the projector. That was an exciting time for me because I had the pleasure of being able to screen the film, that I had just pieced together, alone, in a vast empty auditorium with my large buttered popcorn, Reese's Pieces, and 32oz Coke. I was lucky enough to be the first in Mobile to see many films of that decade. Some, became iconic classics, i.e. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Superman 2, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, The Big Chill. Others became guilty pleasures, Porky's, Hell Night, and the very fun 9 to 5. But, I am compelled to tell you that nothing, and I mean nothing, touched me as much as Mary Tyler Moore becoming Beth Jarrett before my eyes on that huge, larger than life projection screen in front of me. Her performance blew me away and has touched me in ways I could never explain and is something I'll never forget.",Ordinary People

I've heard reviewers say, that in retrospect, Raging Bull is an American classic while Ordinary People seems 'rather ordinary.'I was 15 when I saw this film and I've always loved it.  Every adolescent can identify with feelings of guilt and self-doubt, but Timothy Hutton's portrayal of a boy trying to recover from a suicide attempt is exemplary. Some try to diminish his performance by saying that he garnered a sympathy vote because of the recent death of his father, actor Jim Hutton.  I disagree.  He deserved the recognition he received.Robert Redford extracted fine performances from the entire cast and proved that popular actors can direct, which has since been confirmed with films directed by other stars such as Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson and Sean Penn.Ordinary People is a fine film and I'll always consider it one of my top 20 movies of all time.",Ordinary People
225,ocishihara,"Much more than an ""ordinary"" movie",10,9 November 1999,"At the heart of Ordinary People is actually rather ""ordinary people.""  In this Robert Redford's directorial debut, the film focuses around the Jarrett family, a typical American upper-middle class family.  Calvin (Donald Sutherland) is a determined, successful provider, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) is an organized, efficient wife and their youngest son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton) is a bright, intelligent student.  However, underneath is a family being torn apart by the pain and tragedy of the death of the oldest son, Bucky, in a boating accident.Redford's film has become more than just a movie, but rather a reflection of America's dysfunctional family.  It is full with the emotions that is common to every human experience of suffering and growth.  There are even times and scenes when the movie is so good and real that it is utterly disturbing to watch.  Yet, there are even times and scenes when it is so emotionally enjoyable it's difficult to keep your eyes.  Both times (good and bad) demonstrate the emotional versatility and strength of this >film.Out of the hundreds of movies I've seen over the years, so few have delievered with such real feelings and emotions as this film has.

229,weitzman,"Realistic, Haunting Depiction of Trauma and Recovery",10,20 April 2002,"I was in my early 20s when I witnessed the violent death of a family member. Having had this experience and subsequently being treated for it, I believe that, although somewhat dated, Ordinary People depicts the process of trauma and recovery in a young person with a great degree of accuracy. The dynamics of the Jarrett family, struggling to survive after the tragic loss of Buck, are portrayed both sensibly and realistically.At the center of the film is Conrad, a sensitive, misunderstood youth played marvelously by Timothy Hutton (who won Best Supporting Actor for the role). Conrad's nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety, and rage are all too familiar, as is his painful, desperate isolation from his friends and family. ""It hurts too much to be around you"", he tries to explain to a once best friend. His relationship with his father is bittersweet but typical, and his numerous attempts to reach out to his icy mother are particularly gut wrenching.
Donald Sutherland won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Conrad's loving but misguided and somewhat naive father. If you are a bit tired of seeing Sutherland in sinister or odd roles, rent this film to see him in a rare depiction of a genuinely kind and sensitive man.
In stark contrast to warm and loving father Calvin (Sutherland), Mary Tyler Moore is cold and distant as Beth, Conrad's complicated, perfectionist mother. The scenes where she painfully interacts with her ""number two son"" are particularly moving. One feels alternately shock at her heartlessness towards Conrad, and pity for her inability to deal with her own grief.Judd Hirsch is fabulous as the quirky, chain-smoking psychiatrist  Dr. Berger. With his compassionate, no-nonsense approach and use of free association, he offers Conrad no glib answers or quick fixes... only real solutions to real problems, as he aptly puts it. In contrast to the actions of Dr. Maguire (Robin Williams) in Good Will Hunting, Dr. Berger does not ""force"" physical contact on the troubled Conrad; he waits for the young man to embrace HIM, the strategy of any respectful and thoughtful therapist. Real life trauma survivors should be so lucky to have a doctor of his caliber to wrestle demons with.The supporting cast compliment the main characters well, from the ""boring jocks"" (one of which is a young Adam Baldwin) and the unbending swim coach (M. Emmett Walsh in a typical role), to Conrad's female friends: Dinah Manoff (Empty Nest) in a short but poignant role as Karen from the hospital, and Elizabeth McGovern in a bittersweet, believable performance as a potential girlfriend.Great performances by all... one of my favorites of the Drama genre!",Ordinary People

To me, he makes the movie. Hirsch just plays well with his part and makes you feel like he really is what he seems to be.

I will not attempt to top any of their efforts here by trying to do so myself. Instead, I would like to merely describe its effects on three movie lovers who just can't shut up about film.I saw ""Ordinary People"" with two other people: a friend (we are both male) and my sister. The three of us saw a minimum of fifty movies, mostly together, back in the year 1980: ""Breaker Morant"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Coal Miner's Daughter"", ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"", ""Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears"", and dozens of others. Afterward, we would discuss the various plots, performances, direction, and relative merit of each movie, sharing insights excitedly, comparing each to whatever film or performance it had best approximated. Our lively, often boisterous discussions would begin as soon as we left our seats, sometimes while still seated.Not so with ""Ordinary People"".We rose from our seats, avoiding eye contact with one another, and left the theater in silence. We walked the hundred or so yards across the parking lot to our car, heads bowed, and quietly got in. Then I heard my sister sniffle. Immediately we all started crying in that car, as if on cue. The emotional tension had finally been broken. All we could manage to say between the sobs was how powerfully we had each been moved by this film. It was literally dumbfounding to the three of us. After several minutes, we considered going out for ice cream, but decided it would be too difficult to swallow from the tightness in our throats.We all have certain expectations of the movie watching experience, don't we? We will enter a theater, choose a seat, and be entertained for something over an hour or two. We can expect that there will be a point at which our disbelief will have to be suspended. We do not reasonably expect to be devastated, to be humbled, and to be emotionally wrenched by a few hundred feet of celluloid.Again, not so with ""Ordinary People"".This film hurts you. This film leaves a hole in you. Yet it rewards you. It must also be added that it also has genuinely funny moments, and they are every bit as starkly human as its brutal drama. With all the truly great films that have ever been produced, none can ever really be any better than ""Ordinary People"". It is, perhaps, a perfect film. It must be seen by everyone who wants to know what great film is all about. Great film moves people.

Timothy Hutton delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen as Conrad Jarrett and it is a shame that he never really took off in Hollywood. His scene after he discovers that his friend from the hospital (played by the underrated Dinah Manoff)commits suicide and he finally opens up to Dr. Berger is the moment that made this movie and made him deserve that Oscar.Dr. Berger was Judd Hirsch, who also received a deserving nomination for BSA but his performance was more subtle while Hutton's was a mixture of that and ""bang-pow"". Hirsch's character seems to be low on words at times but he gets his point across and he is a very wise person. If there was ever a time that a Supporting duo could share an Oscar for a film....this is Definitely it!! Now Robert DeNiro fully deserved his Oscar for RB but I feel that if there were no DeNiro that year then Donald Sutherland should have won for giving a very loving and passionate performance as the caring dad Calvin who doesn't really understand everything that is happening. The only thing that prevented from a win was the fact that HE WASN'T EVEN NOMINATED!! This was a very horrible snub and I personally felt this was his best performance and it deserved a nomination and in any other year a win.Lastly, everyone loves Mary Tyler Moore and thinks she is one of our most lovable TV icons....well in this movie you can see she can act like a really snobby b**ch!! Moore's performance as Beth is amazing because it is a VERY against type role for her and she pulls it off EXTREMELY well. The character of Beth is so cold and hateful but even though you know she is grieving Buck's death you can't help but dislike her because she is so cold towards Conrad. Moore and Sissy Spacek (Who eventually won without any complaints) were worthy of a win and these two women will forever split into thinking who deserved it more.Ordinary People is a great movie that makes you think and I will also say it is not the movie to watch if you want to be cheered up because it is a very emotional film. Very underrated.",Ordinary People
247,albatrospg,One of the Best Movies I've ever seen!,10,22 June 1999,"Ordinary People is a great movie, that everyone should watch! The actors are all terrific: first of all Timothy Hutton, with an Academy Award performance, but also Mary Tyler Moore (Who deserved the Academy Award instead of Sissy Spacek!), Donald Sutherland and Judd Hirsch. Robert Redford as a director is great. A great lesson of acting!!!",Ordinary People
248,lucymar_7,..and I said to myself what a wonderful world!,10,4 February 2007,"every time I see this movie I feel free to feel! I believe that Robert Redford knew exactly how a psychologist react on such cases and of course how the actors should behave. Furthermore the actors on the leading roles where marvelous, especially the performance of Tim Hutton who was breathtaking. In brief this movie should be a paradigm to other film-makers as the only thing that really matters is to show ordinary feelings on ordinary situations (and not how hard would be the survival of a hero during a terrible war between the great empire of the tomatoes with bla bla bla or something like that!) (unfortunately I can't be more specific because I find it difficult to chose what I liked most on the film and of course to use the English language for my comments!) I undoubtely recommend this film to every cinefil(semi Greek word subscribing people who love watching movies)",Ordinary People
249,strandkd,Everyone grieves differently,9,19 October 2021,"Beautifully written, cast, acted, and visually presented (notice the clothing colors throughout, for example). Just an amazing movie. My one beef is with the synopsis-writer in this app, who really missed what was going on with the wife (played with such intelligence by Mary Tyler Moore), even that the husband tells the wife how she's feeling in their last scene together when her pain is so clearly present. He can't listen to her any more than she can bear to connect with her remaining son or handle messes. While the son's anger is all outward and the father's is all confusion, hers is all inward.This movie bears watching other times, once to focus on each of the three family members.",Ordinary People
250,wcn-13462,Relatable,10,24 November 2020,"This film to me is even more gut wrenching now then when I first saw it at the theater in 1980. I had the same kind of relationship with my mom, but was thisclose to my dad. My brother who was three years older than me was moms favorite and died suddenly. At age 15 I tried to off myself and spent time in the same kind of facility that Conrad did in the film. Needless to say it is very difficult to get through. But great acting, and I highly recommend it unless, like me, it's eerily relatable. :-)",Ordinary People
251,lubainafia,This movie just made me stronger.,10,2 October 2020,"I have suffered from anxiety disorder for so long, and I know exactly how it feels to suffer from any of the mental illness. This movie illustrated the life of a boy who's suffering from chronic depression, insomnia, nightmares and so much. Its so hard to make people know how you feel, even your own parents and siblings and friends can turn out to be your worst enemies. Some people will even ignore the fact that you have problems and try to mock at you because you don't act normal. But the truth is, good times will eventually come. Talking to a good psychiatrist who'll act like your friend and make sure that whenever you are in pain he'll/she'll be there, can make you feel so safe.
The character Conrad seemed like going through so much hard times yet he managed to dig down and consult a psychiatrist himself even when his mom was against him, concerned about social prestige. Conrad managed to understand that he might be bombastic but deep down he always wanted to love his mom and do as much as possible to keep his parents less worried. Even though he seemed quite messed up, he was trying so hard not to act up. At the end when his father decided to tell her mom that she was wrong to Conrad, lacking affection and realizations, her mother left home, and his father was kind of devastated, but Conrad stood strong to say how much he loved his father.
This movie absolutely illustrates how much misinterpretation and misconception we might still have in our society about mental health and conducting proper psychiatrist. It's more considered as a weakness to consult a psychiatrist when you're so much in trouble that you can't even make your family and friends understand, but trust me, you'll be able to learn and handle things slowly like Conrad did.",Ordinary People
252,extrimexboxer1,Terrable!!!,1,19 November 2006,Anyone who read the book will agree with me. I usually think that the movie is better then the book but i can honestly say that it was not that way in this case. I understand when making a movie you can not include every detail but when you leave out some of the most important scenes that is outrageous. I think that one of the reasons for this may have been because in the book there is allot of going into peoples minds and hearing what they are thinking. There are ways to include things like that. Another thing i did not like was that they added some scenes that were not necessary and that just in my opinion wasted time. You don't have to take my opinion for it but read the book and then watch the movie and you will see what i am talking about.,Ordinary People

254,hgrowng04,ordinary people,10,12 January 2007,"I have seen this movie several times and I think it hits in a nerve that only a dysfunctional family can understand. Life is not perfect. We can put that facade on for others, but the truth will eventually appear. Ironically, I see a similar resemblance to my own upbringing in a Northwest Chicago neighborhood where the homes were big and envied but nothing was what it seemed. Ordinary People is an honest movie. A family that is dysfunctional needs a psychologist on all levels. The Jarretts, have a terrible time dealing with their sons accidental death. Conrad ( played by Timothy Hutton ) and Calvin ( Donald Sutherland ) are seeking to find happiness and resolve to move to the future while Beth is a constant reminder of wanting to hold on to the past. She unconsciously, blames her son Conrad, and most importantly, does not show love to him.I especially, love the scenes with Beth ( Mary Tyler Moore ) where she cannot handle the emotional side of herself. It is obvious she is a perfectionist, who loves to control her family. Mary Tyler Moore does a wonderful performance showing the nature of Beth Jarrett which is a selfish, manipulative, controlling woman. Donald Sutherland also , does an excellent acting performance in that, he shows how he is in denial of his families situation.He is torn between his wife and the love for his son. It is obvious that Calvin Jarrett is a confused man, but wants happiness in life. Conrad is stuck in a serious depression and is fighting his own demons. It is interesting to note the dynamics of the message of this movie: there is a great danger in hiding your true emotions, even worse not knowing how to express them. This movie, is over twenty years old, but holds true today and is a glimpse into the world of a dysfunctional family. I recommend it , but be prepared to feel the for the Jarretts. It could happen to anyone..... every thing is not always what it seems behind the closed door of a prestigious neighborhood.",Ordinary People
255,drcramer,"A deep, important film for all of us",10,25 January 2009,"I lost my father to suicide when I was 13. I loved him as I had no other, and his death shattered me into a million pieces. Like Conrad, I became withdrawn, felt as though no one could understand me, and could feel only pain and confusion inside of me. While Conrad remembered the boating accident in his nightmares I had the strangest nightmare of my father talking to me but with no sound coming out of his mouth. This nightmare continued on well into my adult life. When I saw ""Ordinary People"" for the first time it was like looking into my darkest corner, yet the beauty of the film healed me immeasurably. I am very grateful to Mr. Redford for his expertise in bringing this story to the screen. I am also indebted for life to Mr. Hutton for his masterful interpretation of Conrad. Every ounce of pain he acted in the film went through me and somehow helped me cope with my own pain. Though it has been 38 years since my father left me the pain is still inside my soul and at any moment can reappear and take over my mind and thoughts. However, because of the brilliance this film I can and do cope better. I will be indebted to ""Ordinary People"" for my entire life.",Ordinary People

What everybody says about Mary Tyler Moore, Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch, and how wonderful/painful this movie is, is correct, but the highlight of this film for me was the personal swings of Sutherland, and his realization towards the end.Although Donald has gone on to type cast himself in a corrupt prison warden role for some reason, this movie shows his brilliance as an actor IMHO.",Ordinary People

Robert Redford, the director did an excellent job of describing a family drama through film. Mary Tyler Moore, and Donald Sutherland are also excellent, and the academy award winner for best supporting actor (who totally deserved it) is Timothy Hutton. His portrayal/acting of the character Conrad was EXCELLENT. If you haven't seen... I really urge you to rent it.",Ordinary People
258,eugenecostello,Still resonates,9,7 January 2009,"I watched this tonight on TCM. It is still a perfectly crafted analysis of a family in meltdown, with a directorial deftness of touch that handles the material quietly but insistently, never shouting. Mary Tyler Moore, for instance, gives a perfect performance as the Stepford mum - or Mom - who refuses to lose control and give way to the mess of life and emotion, seeing that as unseemly turmoil. Sutherland is, as ever, excellent. And Hirsch turns in a great performance as the psychiatrist, though I believe some professionals felt it too one-dimensional. I disagree, though I'm not a shrink.I was thinking while watching it, if you were asked to name your top ten movies of each decade from the 40s on, you'd have little trouble - from All About Eve, Rebecca, Key Largo etc through to Cool Hand Luke, Cincinnati Kid, Dr No, Saturday Night Fever, Mean Streets, The Godfather I and II, Once Upon A time In America - I could go on all night - you'd have troubles when you came to the 80s. All that springs to mind is slightly embarrassing crap like Footloose, Top Gun, Dirty Dancing and so on.This film - albeit probably shot in the 70s, just - makes you realise there was a lot of good to come out of that much- (and often rightly) maligned decade.One last point - watching the credits roll I noticed that Redford didn't bill himself. Unusual modesty or what?",Ordinary People

I don't want spill my guts about my childhood on here, but I think any family who has experienced a horrific life-changing event of losing a child/sibling needs to see this.

I had been on antidepressants for about a year (in the pre-prozac days) and I happened to see this movie on Showtime or HBO - almost by accident. Timothy Hutton perfectly captures what it's like to be depressed as a teenager. And Judd Hirsch and Hutton perfectly capture the patient/therapist relationship. There are also a few perfect little scenes that capture the problems of a family that can't communicate. Especially memorable is the scene where Calvin tells Beth about the shoes he wore to Buck's funeral. This film captures all of the important moments like this that truly demonstrate the problems the family is having. After seeing it, I read the book and I knew that if Conrad could go on, so could I. I watch this movie once every few years. It really means a lot to me.",Ordinary People
261,khani01,"The film is about an upper middle class family that has two sons, and one of them died in a boating accident.",10,19 March 2011,"Ordinary People is a film that was written by Alvin Sargent and Nancy Dowd. Ronald Schwary was the producer and Robert Redford directed the film. The film is about an affluent family that has two sons, and one of them died in a boating accident. Donald Sutherland played Calvin Jarrett and Mary Tyler Moore played Beth Jarrett. Calvin and Beth with their sons Conrad and Buck lived in Lake Forest, Illinois. Calvin and Beth's oldest son Buck died in a boating accident. But Conrad, their youngest son survived the accident and felt responsible for his brother's death. Conrad went into a state of depression and tried to commit suicide, he was hospitalized due to his injuries. Timothy Hutton was played by Conrad Jarrett. After leaving the hospital Conrad started seeing a psychiatrist. Conrad's parents and friends found it very difficult to communicate with him, because of his mental condition. Beth awkwardly struggles to connect with her son, and it appears to have loved Buck more than Conrad. Calvin noticed the relationship between Beth and Conrad was getting worst so he tried to intervene in an attempt to resolve the situation. But refuses to comprehend her loss and struggles to maintain her composure, which put a strain on her relationship with Calvin. Ordinary People is an amazing film that looked into a family that struggles to make themselves appear to be so normal, but in reality is incredibly dysfunctional. The novel was written by Judith Guest in 1976 and published by Penguin Books. The combination of reading the novel and watching the film gives me a detailed synopsis of the chain of events. Even though a very important part of the novel was not mentioned in the film, Robert Redford and Ronald Schwary delivered a dramatic film. The fact that Calvin grew up in an orphanage was very relevant to the theme and plot of the novel.Unfortunately, that was edited out of the film. Timothy Hutton did an amazing job in his role. He played the role of the mentally disturbed teenager so well that you felt connected with his character. The low key lighting in the film really increased the dramatic intensity and allowed me to feel the importance of each scene. If I had to choose between the film and the novel, I would have to say the film. What made the film so different from the novel are the motifs, the high-key lighting, and the indirect subjective point of view that was employed in the film. The sequence of the scenes and the way Robert Redford manipulated and distorted the sound puts me inside of the character. Ordinary People is an American drama film that I truly enjoyed.",Ordinary People
262,qotsabenny,Counselor Review,10,1 February 2015,"I watched ""Ordinary People"" last night and it was stunning. Robert Redford directed Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, and Timothy Hutton in an Academy winning film. Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor and Writing were the Oscars this one, plus a grip of Globes and other accolades.From 1980, the images of affluent middle class suburban family life feel like St. Elmo's Fire or a Ralph Lauren catalog. The music is all comforting and pleasantly familiar melodies. The family dynamic reminded me of Catcher in the Rye. The Favorite Son's death causes family dysfunction to be exposed through the incorporation of psychoanalysis. The therapy never took the forefront of the film but was surely the facilitating catalyst that sets into motion the tempest of the films crescendo.Judd Hirsch's therapist uses a Hollywood mix of Person Centered approach and classic analytic therapy. He engages young Conrad at face value; opening up a common ground where there is no hierarchy anymore. Conrad is brought to emotional breaking points and when he holds back information, he is prodded to open up and share. The break through comes in a scene of transference. Timothy Hutton (Conrad) re-enacts the boating scene where he lost his brother with Judd Hirsch (the therapist) in the role of Buck, the lost brother. By allowing Connie to role play that scene that he had buried within himself it open up repressed memories of it.The movie was good; worth watching, and it was a good representation of the therapeutic processes that are described in the book. Reading them and assimilating the knowledge into my repertory is now cemented by this effective, visual and emotionally representation.",Ordinary People

Hutton and Moore both give very effective performances and draw the viewer in to their respective worlds. Moore's rigidity and Hutton's simmering emotions make this film very authentic. You'll be hooked from the beginning! This is a work of art that doubles as a brilliant character study of a family dealing with a tremendous loss. Sutherland's performance is also commendable as the truly concerned father. His character balances out Moore's character flawlessly, and works as a buffer and a cohesive unit in the tragic family.

A genre that was took in the 90's and then added crazy elements like fantastic vacations or animals talking. Don't get me wrong , I like those movies too, but sometimes someone somewhere needs to write something that is related to us (such as feelings, relationships or even social status). Unfortunately if you ask people what are the best movies of the 80s, they're probably going to answer you a fantasy-big budget- pop culture- cult classic(that I also probably enjoyed) but they won't say this kind of marvelous and wonderful pieces, just because they don't know it or don't care(or both). Films like Ordinary people, Terms of Endearment, Kramer vs. Kramer, Heartburn, Moonstruck, etc. are movies with strong characters, beautiful settings and stories that seem simple but are one of the most deep and profound things you are ever going to watch in a movie, because in some ways you can see some of you in it. I'm not saying that ""they don't make movies like this anymore"". Of course they do (Little Miss Sunshine, The Royal Tenembaums, Boyhood are good examples), but the public doesn't seem to had an impact as big as they did in the 80's or 70's.

One really hates Mary Tyler-Moore at the end for being a bitch first class, a mother with no feelings for her youngest son. Judd Hirsch is very funny in acting as a psychologist.

Mary also plays well as cold, emotionally repressed mother where her emotion is not shared to anyone. She doesn't want to face with the problem directly and just wants it to be just fine. The kind of perfect mother who is actually flawed in her emotion. totally deserving Oscar for that role which is a very complex one to play.

Donald Sutherland should have been nominated and Timothy Hutton should have been in the Best Actor category. It is Robert Redford's shining moment in film history.
