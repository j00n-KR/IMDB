0,TheLittleSongbird,"A lovely movie, if not quite shining as brightly as it ought to have done",8,31 March 2011,"I got the DVD of Bright Star as a get well present while recovering in hospital from a major spinal operation recently. Looking at the cover, it looked like my kind of movie, a romance and a period drama. Last Sunday, I watched it and was very impressed overall. It is a beautiful movie and competently directed and acted, but two things stop it from shining more than it could have done.One is some of the dialogue. Not all mind, most of it is wonderfully poetic and moving, but then there is some of the more abstract language that feels more stilted and not as feasible to understand. My main problem is the pace, which throughout is rather slow making one or two scenes in the middle act a tad dull.However, as a depiction of the joy of first love and the heart break that succeeds it, Bright Star is very effective. The final twenty minutes are heart-breaking, and the mood of the film compliments Keat's sensuous style beautifully. Jane Campion directs very competently, with each scene and season moving pretty much seamlessly to the next.Bright Star has a beautiful, moving story, beautifully told and tells the story of Keats, his love and his beautiful poetry lovingly. The film looks exquisite, with lovely photography and authentic costumes and the painterly, watercolour-like scenery is spellbinding. The music adds to the poignancy, the background scoring is effective without overpowering and I liked the use of the Mozart piece if not the arrangement and how it was performed, some of the singing lacked support and the piece works much more as a chamber work.The acting is fine and appropriately understated. Ben Whishaw is dashing and compellingly misty-eyed, while Paul Schneider adds a slight touch of menace and perhaps even realism to the picture. It was Abbie Cornish though who gave the best performance, one minute she is appropriately stern, another minute she is very poignant.All in all, a lovely movie, could have been more, but one movie I would see again willingly. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",Bright Star
1,SnoopyStyle,true romance,8,21 August 2016,"It's 1818 in Hampstead Village on outer London. Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) is introduced to John Keats (Ben Whishaw). At first, he dismisses her as a fashionista. She pursues him by reading his poems. She shows compassion to his sick brother Tom who passes away. His lack of an income keeps him from truly pursuing a romance. His friend and writing mate Charles Brown (Paul Schneider) aims to show Fanny as a cruel flirt by sending her a Valentine.In the sure hands of Jane Campion, this has both a poetic and true feel of romance. She shows restraint which only heightens the passion. The Brown valentine is a shocking turn and the height of romantic drama. In particular, Abbie Cornish delivers a compelling of a relentless love from the heart and passion from the time era.",Bright Star
2,writers_reign,Odes And Ends,7,22 November 2009,"We were barely two reels in when I realized that Ben Wishaw was failing to inhabit the role of Keats as, for example, Marion Cotillard inhabited the role of Piaf; when I found myself musing on Wishaw's resemblance both physically and facially to the young Tom Courteney, it was apparent that he was failing to deliver. By contrast Abbie Cornish was outstanding and the film as a whole managed to evoke a world light years away from the present day. Whilst I had no preconceived mental image of what I thought Keats should or would look like it definitely wasn't Ben Wishaw. Director Campion makes no attempt to tell us where Keats was born, who his parents were, where he was educated how, indeed, he fetched up in Hampstead assuming he wasn't born there. She is clearly of the opinion that like other literary love affairs - Browning/Barratt, Satre/deBeauvoir, Hammett/Hllman - the viewer's interest is focused on the meat rather than the bread and butter between which it is sandwiched. In my case I know little of Keats beyond the 'easier' poems - La Belle Dame Sans Merci, Autumn, Nightingale, Grecian Urn - which I learned as a child and from which I can still quote reasonable chunks but that is light years away from being a Keatsian scholar or even reasonably well informed about the man rather than the verse and having seen the film I have added to my meagre knowledge only the fact that Keats had a brother who pre-deceased him and an overly protective friend who also dabbled in verse. I accept that Whishaw is highly regarded as an actor both on stage and screen; I saw his widely praised Hamlet on stage and was not moved to toss my hat in the air or dance in the streets and his performance in the film Perfume did little to change my mind. I will, however, resist the temptation to describe his Keats as Wishaw-washaw and hazard a guess that it was the brilliance of Cornish's performance that totally eclipsed his. The film may still be recommended as first-class Art House fodder.",Bright Star
3,evanston_dad,Jane Campion's Latest Is a Flat Dud,4,11 March 2010,"How could the same director who put such intense eroticism on screen in ""The Piano"" be responsible for this dull, tepid film? ""Bright Star"" tells the story of poor poet John Keats and the passionate love he shared with his muse, Fanny Brawne. But you'll have to take the film's word that this passion existed, because mighty little of it ever makes an appearance on screen. Ben Whishaw, who plays Keats, and Abbie Cornish, in a rather lifeless performance as Brawne, are good at moping around but not much else. The film's biggest dramatic conflict is that Keats and Brawne want to get married but can't because both are too poor. So they instead wander around English cottages and countryside reciting poetry to one another. Paul Schneider, as Keats' jealous friend, tries hard to imbue some energy into the film, but his character is too bothersome to make those rare bouts of energy enjoyable.A flat dud.Grade: C-",Bright Star
4,ferguson-6,3 Long Saturdays,7,9 October 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. From writer/director Jane Campion (The Piano), this is beautiful and touching story of unrequited love between the incredible poet John Keats and designer/seamstress Fanny Brawne.Ben Whishaw (Perfume) does a fine job capturing the frailty, sensitivity and many moods of the poet, and give us a peek at his thoughts regarding his own death. The only real glimpses we get into Keats' writing process are his scenes with Paul Schneider (as Mr. Brown). Schneider's character is overly protective of Keats the genius and Keats the man ... almost to the point of obsession.The real Bright Star of the film is Abbie Cornish (Elizabeth, A Good Year) as Fanny Brawne. She brings much depth to character and her emotions caused me to well up a couple of times (not a common experience for me). Star-crossed lovers seems so cliché, but certainly fits this story.While I would have preferred more insight into the Keats genius, this is really a story of love and emotions. So we make do with the voice overs and bits of Keats poetry that Campion tosses in.",Bright Star
5,phd_travel,Too draggy,3,31 July 2010,"This film could have been good. But the indulgent directing, slow pace and limited story caused it to fail.The subject matter is naturally interesting. The leads Ben and Abbie are earnest and good actors, even if Ben has a chimp like appearance and Abbie is common. But the movie is too slow. It shows a rather limited part of Keats' life that could have been covered in an hour. Jane Campion made a mistake in spending the entire movie on so little subject matter. There are many minutes where hardly anything happens.The love between the leads is interesting but more could have been shown of Keats' early life and his poetry. After all the love affair isn't everything about him.",Bright Star
6,gradyharp,"A Very Gentle, Quietly Powerful Love Story",10,30 January 2010,"John Keats is still hailed as one of the greatest of the Romantic Poets and Writer/Director Jane Campion offers a biographically centered yet lyrically poetic version of the few years that that inspired so many memorable works. She has carefully studied the letters of John Keats to his muse Fanny Brawne, researched the period in and around 1818 and has devised a love story that ranks with the finest of Romantic writers. This is a film to absorb slowly, with repeated viewings, a dream like tale of just what the measured passions of the period were like during the time in which they unfolded. There is a strange triangle here: Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish of 'A Good Year' and 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age') lives with her mother (the subtle actress Kerry Fox) and here siblings (fine, detailed performances by Edie Martin and Thomas Sangster). In part of the house lives one Charles Armitage Brown (Paul Schneider of 'Lars & the Real Girl', 'The Assassination of Jesses James...', etc), a wannabe artist who shares his living space with John Keats (the brilliant Ben Wishaw of 'Perfume', 'Brideshead Revisited', 'I'm Not There' etc) who along with writing poetry he finds difficult to publish is caring for his dying brother. Brown love Keats and is devoted to his happiness, but vies for the attention of Fanny who is caught up in her own 'artistry' of sewing. From Keats Fanny learn about poetry, a form of art she has not encountered, and in the times she spends with Keats as her teacher she simultaneously avoids the innuendos of Brown and instead feels her heart awaken to Keats. Fanny's mother sees Keats' gifts and deeply admires him, but warns her daughter not to become involved with a poet who cannot support her expectations of marriage into wealth. The triangle of love and devotion among Keats, Brown, and now Fanny is the core of the story and is handled in the most subtle way that few other directors than Campion could accomplish. Keats develops tuberculosis and for heath reasons is instructed to go to the warmer climes of Italy for recovery. It is from Italy that Keats writes his letters (and a poem 'Bright Star') to Fanny that seals the hearts and souls of the two delicate lovers. Keats succumbs to his disease and Fanny continues her life of celibacy, wandering the heath, longing for the love of her life. The DVD offers comments form Jane Campion regarding the making of this film and her insights into the characters shed precious light on the film. The cast is exceptional, with stunning portrayals by Wishaw, Cornish, Schneider and Fox. This is a gentle film to treasure, much the way we still treasure the poems of the inimitable John Keats. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",Bright Star
7,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Bright Star,2,15 February 2010,"Just as how Nine failed to garner critical acclaim, I'm quite surprised at the accolades that Bright Star received, for its biographical story of one of the greatest Romantic Poets, John Keats. This should appeal to fans of the poet in watching a film regarding his romantic episode with Fanny Brawne, but for the casual movie goer (ahem like myself), Bright Star was anything like the brightness it got touted, and is pretty much an acquired taste.For a film that proclaims to be that of a romance, and what more one would have thought Keats was a romantic at heart to have churned out some of the greatest poems, Jane Campion somehow sucked the romanticism completely out of her film, and the performance by Ben Whishaw as Keats can be summed up in one word - dry. It didn't help that his character spends a lot of time brooding, while best friend Charles Brown (Paul Schneider) spends a lot of time behaving as the opposite, loud mouthed braggart who thinks the world of himself.It's a period piece, but one which had its plus points drawn from its locales (the Spanish Steps at the end had a lot of significance, and to be filmed on site void of people is simply amazing), and costumes thanks to the plot device of Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) being her own strong-headed fashion designer of sorts who sews and modifies her own clothes. You know the drill by now, man meets woman and they fall in love, much to the opposition from friends and family members.What took the cake was that the film was an extremely long poetry recital. Heck, Keat's poems were read aloud from time to time, by the characters themselves. If I want to know more about the poem, I'd get an audio tape, or read it from a book. Having it done the way it is in the film, just reeks of pure laziness. We neither know nor explore, nor were even given a whiff of a suggestion how his inspiration for his poems came about, other than being hopelessly smitten by Fanny. Letters to Fanny too were read aloud against some dull visuals, and I think someone forgot to remind Campion that we're dealing with film here, so please, let me see something that the movie stills seem to purport - that of Keats and Fanny spending one heck of a time together.This film proves a point though, that putting two eye candy cast together does not automatically spell magic. True that one cannot expect big bang fireworks given the social rules that govern meetings between singles, but surely this is worst than watching paint dry on the wall. Uninspiring, and a Bright Star that's just like a comet, shining bright before crashing and burning. You've been warned, unless you're a poetry fan, and even so I'd advise you to go for a recital instead.",Bright Star
8,JamesHitchcock,Would I were stedfast as thou art,7,20 December 2011,"""Bright Star"" is a filmed biography of the poet John Keats, concentrating on his romantic relationship with Fanny Brawne during the last three years of his life. The story opens in 1818 when Keats and Fanny are introduced to one another while he is staying at the Hampstead home of his friend Charles Brown, and ends with his death from tuberculosis in Rome three years later. The title is derived from a sonnet by Keats named ""Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art"". (I keep the original spelling). The poem is believed to have been inspired by that romance and, although the reference in its opening line is clearly to a literal star, not a metaphorical one, Fanny has become known as Keats's ""bright star"".Recent years have seen a glut of films based on the novels of Keats's older contemporary Jane Austen, and these may have served as the inspiration for another film with a literary theme set against a Regency background. The film was directed by Jane Campion, who has made a number of other films with a literary or historical background, such as ""An Angel at My Table"" (a biography of the writer Janet Frame), ""The Piano"" (set in 19th century New Zealand), and ""Portrait of a Lady"" (based upon a novel by Henry James).As portrayed by Abbie Cornish, Fanny is a young lady of good family, obsessed with fashion and with creating dresses, hats, and other garments for herself. She is also flirtatious and seemingly shallow, a strange match for the more intellectual Keats. Another possible obstacle to their union is that Keats comes from a relatively humble background and fears that, because of the difference in their social standing, Fanny's family will not welcome him as a prospective match for her. As the film progresses, however, we begin to see more of Fanny's more serious side, and she and Keats fall deeply in love.I didn't care much for Ben Whishaw's performance in the first film I saw him in, ""Perfume"" from 2006, but he has certainly improved as an actor since then, on the basis of both this film and ""Brideshead Revisited"". Here he plays Keats as a rather quiet young man, externally aloof and reserved but deeply passionate underneath.As one might expect of a film from Campion on this particular theme, there is little in the way of physical action; the film deals more with emotional states and with the growth of love between Keats and Fanny. Like a number of British period dramas, the film is not only visually attractive but also sensitive and poetic and, in its tragic conclusion, deeply moving. A most enjoyable evening's viewing. 7/10",Bright Star
9,lasttimeisaw,Bright Star,9,4 September 2010,"Like the protagonist in VINCERE is not Mussolini, but his lover Ida Dalser, BRIGHT STAR's backbone is Fanny Brawne instead of John Keats, the most amazing credit of this film BRIGHT STAR is that it relights my passion towards poems (maybe RELIGHT is not accurate, as in this era, it is so difficult to sit peaceful and quiet while completely saving some time for poems). Neither Fanny or Keats are saints, it is Keats' poems purifies their freckled characteristics, and successfully exerts an immense pathos on their love story.Jane Campion finally recollects her most skillful talent to create an non-contemporary (please forget IN THE CUT 2003), 19th century scroll of a heart-wrenching story with a slow but poignant pace, gracefully shows us a romantic yet sentimental natural settings with costumes filled with relishes of that time (received an Oscar costume nomination this year). The performance is definitely Oscar-worthy, especially for ABBIE CORNISH, here in BRIGHT STAR her portrayal of the Keats-addicted Fanny which reflects an analogue of CANDY (2005), in which she co-stars with late HEATH LEDGER, they play a contemporary drug-addicted young couple entrapped in a plight. These two roles are paralleling in different times. BEN WHISHAW is also giving a solid performance, owing to the fact that in I'M NOT HERE (2007), he has already interpreted the same role (even thought he is a 1/6 embodiment of BOB Dylan in that film), so strictly speaking, not too much excitement from he re-acted performance. Supporting casts including KERRY FOX and PAUL SCHNEIDER, both shine in their limited screen time. Call me sentimental, I have a huge empathy towards the story of Fanny and Keats, when love clashes with an irreversible tragedy, the powerlessness is powerful enough to destroy all other things.Finally an ending statement, poet is a truly self-destruction profession, it's not easy to be a poet, or his other half.",Bright Star
10,KineticSeoul,"Uninspiring, boring, tedious",5,27 May 2010,"Although I give credit for it being pretty realistic romance movie that revolves around the poet John Keats, it's still a pretty boring and tedious film that drags on and on about the same thing. Which is basically about John Keats struggling to make a living out of being a poet while also being in love with Fanny Brawne, and although a lot of the stuff going on is believable although I never lived in 19th century England. But the thing is nothing about it is really interesting and feels dull at times, and the thing about John Keats not choosing to be without Fanny Brawne cause he doesn't want to take away her happiness thus tearing the relationship apart is touching, but even when the movie ends and the credit starts rolling it just doesn't leave an impact. For a indie film it did alright I guess and this film really isn't for everyone, but those that did enjoy it, I guess more power to you although I don't know why unless your really into poetry but even than I think most audiences will find the film to be boring.6/10",Bright Star
11,Buddy-51,a work of art,9,31 January 2010,"As any true romantic will tell you, there's more genuine passion to be found in a love that goes unrequited than in any happily-ever-after ending a writer could come up with. Certainly, the Romantic poets understood this - and so, too, does Jane Campion, the acclaimed director of ""Sweetie"" and ""The Piano,"" whose exquisitely understated film ""Bright Star"" has as its subject one of the giants of Romantic poetry, John Keats.The movie begins in 1818, when Keats, a young and virtually penniless - though already published - writer meets and falls in love with Fanny Brawne, a woman of some means and family background who prides herself on her way with a needle and her willingness to speak her mind in matters of importance in life. Though monetary concerns and differences in social standing make a match between them a virtual impossibility, the love between the two becomes the defining force of their beings - be they together or apart, in sickness or in health, in life or in death. Fanny, we are told, became the inspiration for some of Keats' most beloved works - including ""Bright star, would I as steadfast as thou art,"" a sonnet from which the movie takes its title - and they, along with the letters the lovers wrote to one another over the course of their three-year courtship, provide the main primary sources for Campion's screenplay (a key secondary source is the biography of Keats by Andrew Motion). And if the story of Keats and Brawne plays like a romantic novel itself, that's undoubtedly part of what drew Campion to the material in the first place. In terms of emotional power alone, she clearly knew what she had with this story.Ironically, the most overtly passionate relationship in the film is not the one between the two lovers but the one between Fanny and Charles Armitage Brown, Keats' devoted friend and fellow writer, who jealously guards the poet and his work, and who sees Fanny as a potentially fatal distraction to both the man and his work. It's hate-at-first-sight for the two of them, with Fanny viewing Brown as little more than a crude, arrogant boor, almost a rival in her love for Keats, and Brown seeing Fanny as a frivolous, flirtatious pseudo-intellectual with nothing of value to contribute to the young genius who seems to have taken such a fancy to her.Unfortunately, many people may avoid seeing this film, in the mistaken belief that, just because it is a high-toned ""costume drama,"" then it must ipso facto be stuffy, inert and boring. But fear not, for despite its being set in the genteel world of the 19th Century British countryside, this is no tea-and-crumpets, lace-and-doily affair, but rather a profoundly moving glimpse into the intricacies and complexities of the human heart - one where human passions roil just beneath the surface of the drama and where star-crossed lovers cannot be separated even by death itself.Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw are heartbreaking as the two ill-fated lovers, while Paul Schneider, as Brown, fulfils his role of carping naysayer without ever overplaying his hand.The true beauty of ""Bright Star"" lies in how splendidly Campion matches the lyricism of the subject matter with the lyricism of her film-making. With her flawless eye for composition - artfully arranged but never stagy - Campion makes the bucolic setting an integral part of the drama. The visuals, coupled with a dramatic use of natural sounds and a haunting score by Marc Bradshaw, allow Campion to break free of the bonds of prosaic reality and set the spirits soaring - much as Keats does with his poetry. I swear, there are times when this movie quite literally takes one's breath away.""Bright Star"" is a work of art.",Bright Star
12,dromasca,beautiful cinema work cannot avoid this film slipping into boredom,6,11 October 2009,"It must be quite frustrating for somebody who invested so much art and cinema know-how into making this film, and I suspect holds a lot of passion and tenderness for the heroes and for their times to read such feedback. I cannot however hide the facts. I liked a lot of things in Jane Campion's last film. Almost each scene is a visual masterpiece in setting, in colors, in placement of the actors, in the angles of the camera. It's a beauty to watch. But one does not come to the movies as he comes to a museum, and even for a visit in a museum two hours of continuous beauty without a break are tiring. The actors are well chosen, they are fresh faces and yet beautiful (Abbie Cornish) and expressive (Ben Whishaw' John Keats), and the film also brings the most adorable red-haired kid actor I have ever seen (the name is Edie Martin). Characters develop, and people speak, and fall in love, and love falls apart, and life falls apart, and there is a lot of poetry in all this, loudly read poetry, but then one does not come to the movies as he comes to a poetry reading. Some action is needed, some suspense is deserved - and this is exactly what 'Bright Star' is lacking in my opinion. We know everything that can and will happen in the film from the start, and the only unknown the film can offer is how fast or how slow the 119 minutes will go. Well, they were quite long for me by the end of the film.Jane Campion is back to the period movies genre which made her most famous with 'The Piano'. In-between she made a couple of films in other genres ('Holy Smoke', 'In the Cut') which I liked more than the average critic and IMDb viewers opinion. I looked that the situation is reversed with 'Bright Star'.",Bright Star
13,Irishchatter,Really good sad film,8,16 August 2015,"I have to admit Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw were very good at playing their characters very well. They actually played a real couple in which it gave us a taste of history based on the relationship especially the hard times that was brought upon them.I'm not a poetry fan but I really enjoyed listening to some of the real John Keats real poems. I find that he's probably much a happier poet if he really felt in love and life giving him surprises especially having poor Fanny as his fiancé!It was really good to see Thomas Brodick Sanger and years & years singer Olly Alexander (didn't notice that he was the sick brother until I looked up Google images to which scene he was in) involved in this movie. He really is a good actor for a singer honestly. Safe to say, this is my first film of him in it, now for the next ones :D",Bright Star
14,inkblot11,"Lovely period piece but, does not shine as brightly as one would expect",7,15 October 2009,"John Keats (Ben Whishaw) is a struggling poet who rents some rooms with another writer, Charles Armitage Brown (Paul Schneider) in the Hampstead Hills section of London. Next door is a beautiful young adult lady, Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), her mother and her younger siblings, boy and girl. Fanny excels at sewing and embroidery, designing her own costumes but she has little appreciation for fine writing. Mr. Brown is an obnoxious, quixotic man who sometimes makes ""passes"" at Fanny, much to her disgust. But, John is another matter. Despite her failures at understanding his talent, she is drawn to his sensitive, kind nature. Alas, however, there is little hope for any attachments, for Fanny's family is on the wealthier side and her mother will not approve of an engagement to a penniless man. As Keats struggles to make a name for himself that might improve his chances, the two young lovers continue a tentative, chaste relationship. Will they be able to marry? This is a lovely story with many strong elements. One of the strongest is the script, for Jane Campion's screenplay is touching and elegantly worded. Fine, too, are the performances of the cast, for Whishaw, Cornish, and especially Schneider, an American, shine brightly, as do all of the lesser players. But, the costumes are alternately hideous and charming and the direction is flat and tedious, at times. Most importantly, the absence of a musical score lessens the film's overall impact, although some will dispute this. It is obvious that Campion, who does include singers and dancing music, when appropriate, was emphasizing the dialogue and felt any background music would interfere with the power of the tale itself. Nevertheless, this viewer feels that scores can add greatly to any film's success. Where would the new Pride and Prejudice or Life is Beautiful be, for example, without their sweeping and arresting musical compositions? Therefore, if you love romance or period pieces, do not skip this one, for it does have its merits. But, one can not help but feel that Bright Star would have shone far more powerfully with the additions of some apt melodies and a sharper, better-paced direction.",Bright Star
15,clanciai,Sensitive and convincing reconstruction of the love of John Keats,10,16 May 2021,"This has to be given full score 10 points for its extreme faithfulness and truth in the most admirable effort to reconstruct the full truth and circumstances around John Keats' one and only love, that never was fulfilled. The actors are perfect, including the rather revolting Paul Schneider as his overbearing friend Mr Brown, while the lack of beauty of. Abbie Cornish as Fanny only adds to the convincing realism, and. Ben Wishaw is absoliutely perfect as the poet. The most important characteristic of the film is its absolutely consistent adherence to style, as the 1820s in England are more convincing here than in any of the many Jane Austen films. Jane Campion is famous and commendable for her sense of style and of keeping it up in perfect discipline, like in ""The Piano"", while I must admit that I loathed ""Holy Smoke"". The story is better here, written by Jane Campion herself in pious scrutiny and study of the life and circumstances of Keats; so, in brief, a film presenting overwhelming challenges and difficulties in the effort of making a true film of poetry, could not have been made better.",Bright Star
16,johnnyboyz,Burning Bright.,7,28 October 2011,"After the grot, grime, filth and general unpleasantness of 2003's In the Cut comes the lavish, much more colourful and far easier-on-the-eye Jane Campion piece about two people coming together and forging a relationship. Gone is the dank, Hellish and greyed out locale of contemporary New York City and in its place arrives 19th century Hampstead, in England; a zone peppered with fields, rife with both tranquillity as well as a certain kind of beauty, and often abound with greens and yellows and purples. Away from the smut and corruption of her last film comes the piece about two people poised at respective stages in their lives coming together and lightly bonding - the film covers two people of a younger and more rawer disposition than that of In the Cut; ironic then, that the film would be a rawer and more involving experience as a result.The film will begin with some quilt-work, stitching and sewing and whatnot; with cuts gradually bringing us away from said activity, the person engaging in it and the building within which they were based in order to reveal a farm-like locale and a distant London skyline. Such an opening encapsulates the body of the film; that is to say a pulling away of something so intrinsic, or precise, in nature to reveal a wider picture of something – encapsulated in the film's going on to explore an intrinsic true-to-history tale of poet John Keats' tryst with a certain Fanny Brawne. Abbie Cornish is the one playing Brawne, while Ben Whishaw adopts the role of John Keats. Cornish does superbly, adding to the long list of Campion heroines that include Holy Smoke's Kate Winslet; The Piano's Holly Hunter and the aforementioned In the Cut's Meg Ryan; women getting too involved with men whom are initially perceived as their binary opposites and often getting entangled for the worse. It is she whom we observe stitching during the opening and through her extensive contacts of family and friends, a travelling to Keats' home is the order of the initial exchanges.Once there, Brawne appears opinionated and dares to challenge the far cockier and more confident of the household in additional poet Charles Brown (Schneider) on his work – as much as Brown is what he is, Keats appears shy and retiring through the fact he does not initially show at the gathering at all. In spite of living with Brown and sharing his career field, Keats is a thin and softly spoken fellow; appearing weak in his immediate appearance and lacking the facial hair his counterpart has. It is somewhat counter-balanced to that of Brown and his larger, more pompous disposition, which sees him strike us as rather outlandish and less caring. Shooting down Brown's jibes and petty comments, she goes so far as to denounce whatever little admiration for poetry she already had in front of most people, by which time Keats has appeared. It is additionally revealed his brother is suffering from a serious illness; his parents recently died and that he himself is struggling within his field with exposure and profit. But Keats is still somewhat of an entertainer, his stories and speech seeing most warm to him until the time comes to nail a spontaneous poem after dinner, upon which he falters.Through meeting Keats, Brawne purchases one of his books; this initial exposure to poetry beginning a change in her life which will go on to additionally affect that of Wishaw's character - her prejudices slowly dissipating to warmly lit shots of her lying flat on her back engaging with what this man has written. The two come to formulate more of a bond as the crux of the film progresses, their relationship delicate and often feeling pleasantly poised; a far cry from the franker and more brash nature of the bond between the two leads in In the Cut – so much so, that when Brown sends Fanny a valentine's card as she begins to get to know Keats a little more, it is an explosion of sorts within the realm Brawne and Keats currently occupy. Campion constructs these exchanges to a tee; there are no fast talking exchanges running on hip-dialogue whilst unfolding in a modern day locale rife with large amounts of snow on the ground, these natural and really well performed scenes resonating as they lyrically progress from interaction to interaction.Peppering their relationship is a stark, sociological ethic acting as a really tragically affecting over-tune which persistently threatens to destroy what they have. This is more broadly linked to an apparent agreement both parties should be privy to entering, should they ever consider marriage. Principally, and it's at this point the norms of the era within which the film is set make themselves painfully known thus instilling a greater sense of tragedy, it would be frowned up should the female participant of the marriage be relied upon for income above that of the male. Since Keats struggles within a highly specialist field of artistic and creative integrity, he cannot be relied upon for income to fund the state of matrimony; Campion going on to send up such a belief a wily way, challenging the ideological patriarchy and creating a story leading only to destruction and trauma eased little by the fact two people whom loved one another a great deal were not able to come together out of what are perceived to be false-propositions. It is a notion epitomised in Cornish's pained response to her peers, when she informs them that ""You taught me of love, not of love for a specific class or rich person."" Bright Star is a thoroughly engaging and really rather mature love story one is quite easily caught up in, and is near enough a considerable cut above most films of its year.",Bright Star
17,howard.schumann,What could have been truly sublime is merely full of pathos.,6,20 September 2009,"Although his poetry was little appreciated at the time, John Keats is now considered to be one of the supreme Romantic poets of the nineteenth century. The line from his poem Ode on a Grecian Urn-- ""beauty is truth, truth beauty, -- that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know"" is one of the most quoted passages in the English language and no student can escape high school without encountering his exquisite Ode to a Nightingale. One of only a small number of films that have dealt with the lives of poets, Bright Star, Jane Campion's first film since 2003, revolves around the final years of John Keats (Ben Whishaw) who died of tuberculosis at the age of 25 and his love affair with eighteen-year-old seamstress Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish).Set in 1818 in Hempstead Village in North London, the twenty-three year old Keats and his friend and writing partner Charles Armitage Brown (Paul Schneider) live next door to Fanny, her widowed mother (Kerry Fox), younger brother Samuel (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and adorable sister Toots (Edie Martin) who always accompanies Fanny on her walks. Fanny is a dressmaker who makes her own clothes and is respected for her talent as a fashion designer. She is also bright and personable, never lacking for an escort at the local dances. Jealous of Fanny's growing friendship with the poet, the abrasive Brown tries to keep her away so that his friend can concentrate on his writing but she handles him with considerable wit and their repartee is one of the highlights of the film.Drawn closer to Keats when his brother Tom takes ill with tuberculosis, Fanny is more than eager to understand Keats' poetry but finds it a strain. She asks for lessons and John is willing to comply but tells her that appreciation of poetry must come from the heart. Their relationship grows but suffers as well because of the poet's lack of material success which he is constantly bemoaning and because Fanny is afraid to be too aggressive, fearful of the whispering of neighbors. When John leaves town, Fanny waits by the door each day for a letter as her relationship with the young poet has become the most important thing in her life.When Keats becomes ill with the same illness that claimed his mother and brother, the lovers are continually being brought together and then torn apart and an immense barrier grows between them. Though older than the character by ten years, Cornish does a good job of portraying one of Campion's more strong-willed and determined women. Whishaw's performance, on the other hand, never comes alive and never conveys the type of deeply sensitive character normally associated with a poet.While some of Keats' more well-known poems are read aloud, there is little insight into the creative process or what makes him what he is as a creative artist. Though Bright Star is handled with delicacy and restraint, the film lacks inspiration and a story that could have been truly sublime is merely full of pathos. I'm afraid that instead of feeling moved to go out and read more Keats poetry, by the end of Bright Star, ""my heart ached and a drowsy numbness pained. My sense as though of hemlock I had drunk or emptied some dull opiate to the drains""",Bright Star
18,robert-temple-1,Magnificent and exquisitely sensitive film about the life of John Keats,10,11 April 2010,"Jane Campion has really done it this time. She has gone and made another masterpiece. What is immediately obvious is that this film, set in the years 1818-1821 in Hampstead (Campion correctly and quaintly styles it 'Hampstead Village' in an opening credit) near London, was not made with a mass audience in mind. Every time the BBC produces a classic period drama series, there is an eye on the pubic who will eventually view it. That brings an inevitable artificial gloss to the production values, a kind of psychological airbrush, like a mentally-imposed Photoshop-view of the past. But Campion scorns all such compromises, and brings us a dowdy, unstylish, realistic, and probably authentic view of what life was really like in 1818. The clothes are mostly homemade by the characters, and look it. Fanny Brawne, who falls in love with Keats, boasts of her abilities as a seamstress, but her efforts are not always successful, and things not looking quite perfect is indeed the hallmark of this production. It is not a rosy-tinted vision, it tries to show us what things must really have been like, and just how tough they were. When John Keats's brother Tom is dying of TB, we only see John holding him in his arms in the distance, as glimpsed down a dark hallway by Fanny. All of this helps us feel that we are really back in time, that this is really a true glimpse of the past, as nothing is made easy for us. We struggle to see and to understand, just as the real people in the story must have done. Much of this film is set on Hampstead Heath, the world's largest urban park. I used to know nearly every inch and every bush of Hampstead Heath, when I lived near it. The atmosphere of the Heath (whether is was actually filmed there or not is impossible to detect for certain, but I think not) is conveyed very well. It is amusing that the fascinating and delightful group of singers in the film call themselves the Hampstead Heathens. Not being familiar with the details of Keats's life, I had not heard of them before. Certainly the music for this film is very good indeed. The casting of the main characters is impeccable, and totally successful. The film and the lead players both make a rather slow start, so that for the first 5 or 10 minutes one is not sure whether it is all going to work, and one has to get used to the fact that it is non-glossy production, and one is really not used to that. One of the finest aspects of the film is the natural and unaffected way in which the poetry is read. The best sustained example of this is the wonderful recitation of 'Ode to a Nightingale' by Ben Whishaw over the final credits. He seems to be thinking of it as he says it. Whishaw at first seems an unlikely choice to play Keats, but after one gets used to him being on the screen, the inspired nature of this casting becomes evident. He is simply perfect at it. Even less obvious, but equally inspired, a choice was Australian actress Abbie Cornish to play Fanny Brawne. She gives a many-dimensioned portrayal, showing so many facets it is almost indecent, and one is tempted to ask her to pull her psychological skirt down. She alternates between being petulant, pouting, adoring, doubtful, defiant, angry, sad, loving, thoughtful, brooding, strong, weak, over-hasty, and in short, is a person. And she did all of that without drinking even one can of Fosters, well done. The story of Fanny and Keats is incredibly sad, so you need to be emotionally strong or you will really weep. All that poverty and illness, but would the long waiting lists of the National Health Service of today have made any difference? And can you imagine John Keats ambling along to the Job Centre in the middle of an ode? No, we have still not got the mix right yet for society. Keats's father was a humble publican and Keats's bright star of talent first glowed from amongst the ale barrels of a tavern. Despite coming from below the beer (as opposed to be below the salt), Keats behaves in this film, and doubtless also in real life, as a gentleman. (The class warfare of our own times had not yet begun.) However, marriage was impossible for Keats because he could not afford it. The most he could manage was an engagement ring for Fanny. Paul Schneider establishes a very strong, not to say commanding, presence in the film as Keats's noisy and demanding friend Charles Brown, who is wildly jealous of Fanny and wants Keats to himself. Antonia Campbell-Hughes is very touching and sympathetic as the maid Abigail. The well-known Keats House (Wentworth Place) in Hampstead was not used in the filming, as it is rather small and cramped. I don't know how the amazing scene at the Spanish Steps in Rome was filmed by Campion, or how she got rid of the hordes of tourists and the traffic. It is an amazing shot. At one point in the story, Fanny fills a room with butterflies. Campion permitted glaringly obvious foreign butterflies to intrude upon this scene, a shocking error on her part. When many of us struggle to find a few tiny Adonis Blues in the garden, fluttering round the bird's foot trefoil, and measuring only two inches across, to see giant shiny blue butterflies flaunted in the imagined Hampstead of 1820 really is too much to bear, and all the illusions of verisimilitude crash to the floor ignominiously. Still, we must allow an occasional lapse of judgement when the sign on the door so clearly reads 'Genius at Work'. We can allow Jane Campion the occasional large blue butterfly if it really keeps her going.",Bright Star
19,Chris Knipp,Campion captures the sine curve of romantic experience,9,27 September 2009,"Keats's romance with Fanny Brawne and final days are brought to lovely life in Jane Campion's new film, Bright Star. He had TB, though it's never named. When he had become very ill, they sent him to Rome. How foolish! Its climate isn't healthy, though it might have seemed so compared to Hampstead. The house where Keats lived in Hampstead for two years and was in love with Fanny Brawne and wrote some of his has just been restored.Campion's film may not be a deep investigation of poetical genius, but it's delicate and alive and infinitely touching. There's a delightful litte rosy-cheeked girl, and good use is made of cats. The handsome Regency house was then divided into two, one side occupied by Keats and his landlord and possessive companion Charles Brown, the other by a family called Brawne. He fell in love with Fanny Brawne, and she with him. She is creative in her own way, a brilliant seamstress and designer of clothing who was inventive with fabrics. She didn't know much about poetry but to go by the film, she crammed the classics to be able to talk to Keats and read all his poems and memorized many passages. They recite them back and forth to each other, which may be artificial, but you don't mind, because the poetry is their love, it bloomed through their love and expresses it. Until he began coughing blood and ceased to write because he was suddenly too ill, Keats wrote some of his best work in Hampstead, in love with Fanny Brwwne.They express their love in long sweet kisses, and walking hand in hand. This too is artificial but a fitting symbolic expression of the ecstasy and swoons of romantic poetry.Sometimes the final credits define the experience of a film and of its audience. You have to love a film over whose final credits the wispy, winsome Whishaw is heard softly reading the whole of the Ode to a Nightingale, right to the end, and you have to respect an audience in an American cineplex when many of its members sit still to hear Keats's masterpiece down to the final words, ""Was it a vision, or a waking dream?/ Fled is that music: – Do I wake or sleep?"" Can you imagine having known a person with such extravagant gifts? Campion doesn't get too much in the way of our own imagining. She just lets it happen, lets the cats wander in and out, and thus captures the sine curve of romantic experience, its extremes of joy and despair that are so poignantly focused in the life of this penniless English boy who died at twenty-five, thinking himself a failure, and left behind some of the finest poetry in the language.Abbie Cornish plays Fanny, Ben Wishaw John Keats, Paul Schneider plays Charles Brown. The little rosy-cheeked sister, Margaret ""Toots"" Brawne, is played by Edie Martin. Brown is the villain of the piece, because he jealously guards Keants from Fanny, whom he thinks is a silly girl who only sews and flirts. He's getting in the way of romantic love! And Schneider can't help but seem obtrusive here. Brown redeems himself later when, having gotten the sweet Irish servant girl Abigail (Antonia Campbell-Hughes) with child, he does the right thing and marries her.Fanny's mother says she can't marry Keats, because he has no money, but he proposes, and she accepts, and when the liebestod begins, there's no way of denying his happiness or Fanny's, or the sadness and devotion that made her wear the gold engagement band for the rest of her life. Campion's film offers no profound insights into the poetic process. But how can it? Though Fanny asks Keats to give her ""lessons"" in poetry, its appreciation, like its creation, must be instinctive and cannot be explained, particularly not the ethereal romantic kind. Wishaw's delicate and enigmatic quality is a satisfying image to hang our fantasies on.",Bright Star
20,GiraffeDoor,"As someone with a special fascination with Keats, I like it.",8,14 December 2019,"A movie as direct and lyrical as the poet it's about. This well formed romance is delicate, restrained, unpretentious and is filled with rich imagery and a superb application of the poems we all came to see all carried by two actors that make me believe they share a real love.What they love in each other is less clear and beside the point. A movie of great visual and emotional beauty that is not naive regarding its darker undertones as poetry is depicted as a wonderful despite its status as just escapism from a callous world.",Bright Star
21,MaxBorg89,Old-school romance,8,31 January 2010,"Being best known for period films such as The Piano or Portrait of a Lady, Jane Campion has occasionally tried different things, most notably in 2003 when she directed the Meg Ryan-starring thriller In the Cut, which was greeted with mixed reactions to say the least. Bright Star, well received by critics and audiences - but ignored by the jury - at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, is a welcome return to what the director does best.The film revolves around the last three-four years in the life of Romantic poet John Keats (played in the film by Ben Whishaw), author of such masterpieces as Ode on a Grecian Urn, who met a premature demise at the age of 25, due to tuberculosis. During those years (1818-1820, he died in Rome in early 1821), he met a woman named Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), and the two had a chaste yet passionate love story until his departure from England. His feelings for her were so intense, he wrote a poem to express his affection: Bright Star.Even if one doesn't have extensive knowledge of Keats' life, familiarity with Campion's filmography should help in figuring out the ending. Nevertheless, the inevitable tragedy doesn't prevent her witty screenplay and the fantastic interaction between Whishaw and Cornish (the former more at ease here than in Brideshead Revisited, the latter marvelous as usual) from creating a romance so powerful it convinces and moves all the way. Like the passion that linked Keats and Brawne, Campion's direction is understated but always present, focusing on small details, both in the love story (the short, casual conversations between the two) and elsewhere (as always in her films, the period rendition is flawless).The only times the movie drags is when Campion resorts to formula, requiring an antagonistic presence in the picture, like Harvey Keitel in The Piano: in this case, it is Keats' friend and colleague Charles Brown (Paul Schneider, with an intermittent Scottish accent), whose constant criticisms towards Fanny and her feelings for the poet are no doubt amusing, but severely devoid of real dramatic meat. Fortunately, the rest of the supporting cast delivers, with familiar British faces like Kerry Fox and Thomas Sangster (playing Fanny's mother and younger brother respectively) contributing sparingly but effectively.Bright Star is a beautiful film about a beautiful story, wonderfully shot, written and acted. It may not reach the sublime heights of The Piano (still Campion's masterpiece), but its heart and soul are certainly in the right place.",Bright Star
22,3xHCCH,Embodiment of Gentility,9,16 January 2010,"""Bright Star"" is another film I went into based on its good reputation alone, without any knowledge on what it was about. Turns out, this movie is about poet John Keats and his brief love affair with Fanny Brawne. I confess that I only know Keats by name and by his ""Ode to a Nightingale"", so I welcomed this chance to learn more about his short life.This film is infused in gentility. The entire film is as poetic as the poetry that serves as its backdrop. Director Jane Campion (whose more prominent ""The Piano"" I did not like) lovingly executed the whole project with beautiful images, beautiful words, beautiful music, beautiful costumes. Despite the absence of name stars, the production succeeds to draw you into its spell by its sheer cinematic artistry.Abby Cornish plays 18 year-old Fanny Brawne with spunk and confidence. James Whishaw (whom I later remembered to have been the same actor playing the lead in ""Perfume"") plays the fragile Mr. Keats with rare sensitivity and charm. These two have very good chemistry together. Paul Schneider effectively plays Charles Brown, a friend and patron of Keats who is constantly at odds with Fanny. His character provides the necessary tension to the tenuous love story.This movie is not for all tastes. Its slow pace and poetic language may make some viewers to dismiss this as just boring. For me, even as I do not particularly like romance stories, something about this film captured my interest and admiration. I would now count this as one of my favorite period dramas after ""A Room With A View"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring.""",Bright Star
23,stensson,Keats according to tradition,7,29 December 2009,"Many would say that Mr. John Keats is the greatest poet of his 19th century, and it is maybe hard to disagree. He also had a love story suited for romantic norms, as well as a death. His definition of absorbing poetry is famous. The reader is not supposed to swim from shore to shore. He ought to remain in the water and feel the mystery without coming to learn it.But Jane Campion really takes us from shore to shore and although the plot often is inter-foiled with the most beautiful excerpts from Keats' writings, you anyway have the feeling that so much more could have been made out of this poetry material.A movie which doesn't really dare.",Bright Star
24,Troy_Campbell,Will stick with you well after the end credits roll.,8,20 December 2009,"The two leads, Aussie actress Abbie Cornish and British chap Ben Whishaw, are brilliant. No two ways about it; unequivocally brilliant. Their chemistry is undeniable and serves this picture with a spark so often missing, due to the focus on lavish costumes and sets, from period pieces. Whether they're gazing into each other's eyes or discussing his poetry over a walk through the forest, the starring duo are a clear match on screen. Cornish proves she is capable of breaking into the big time with an award-worthy turn as Fanny; on the outside she may seem straightforward and tough but internally she is fragile and love struck. As the 19th century poet, Whishaw allows Keats to adopt the subtler and less-showier part of the couple, yet manages to elicit enormous emotion with his soulful eyes and whimsical body language.Jane Campion is obviously in love with her subject matter. Her direction shows a distinct admiration for the young poet and this subsequently seeps through the screen onto the audience, ensuring we too feel the way she does. Alas Campion's adorations drags along some faults as well. Most notably her screenplay is too cyclic; a few times we get the same scene twice or thrice over, just presented in a different way. Thankfully the powerhouse acting and perfect cinematography – Greig Fraser's sun bathed palate early on and rain drenched landscape in the later scenes matches the film's emotion flawlessly - steer your thoughts away from the repetitive and slightly weak story of Keats.There is no denying there are a number of classic scenes throughout. You will feel your heart racing during an argument between Keats and Brown – played superbly by Paul Schneider, who may be overshadowed by the youthful leading stars, but gives his supporting character a demanding charisma - which sees the two friends argue over Fanny's intentions and morals, all the while she is standing right there. And the lovers' first kiss is especially moving, not the least because it is followed immediately by a playful segment where the new couple indulge Fanny's younger sister in a game of ""freeze"". With countless other moments just as entertaining and gripping, Bright Star allows you to forgive and forget any errors it may make and unashamedly delivers a desperately romantic movie that will stick with you well after the end credits roll.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Bright Star
25,Sirus_the_Virus,A thing of beauty is a joy forever.,9,1 February 2010,"Bright star is probably not going to get any Oscar buzz this Oscar season. Which is a shame. Though it didn't make my top list, it is a very good film. The film is at times beautiful, the acting is superb, and it's a tragic love story. I am sure it's a true story. Cause it's about Keats. But the film is about the three year romance between poet John Keats(played by Ben Winshaw) and Fanny Brawn(played by Abbie Cornish). Throughout their relationship, they experienced heartbreak, sadness, and pure beauty.The film is horribly dramatic in the last part of the film. This is a beautiful film. There is one of two little flaws. Paul Schneider's character in the film is really annoying. and though the film is under two hours long, it goes awfully slow. Director Jane Campion does such a wonderful job with this film. Though it's not going on my favorites of last year list, I still think it deserves a lot of credit. I hope to see it up for something. To quote Keats, A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Or something like that. See Bright star.Bright star: A-",Bright Star
26,jaredmobarak,There is a holiness to the heart's affections  Bright Star,9,16 September 2009,"Director Jane Campion has always been one of those names who's work I just never had the pleasure of viewing. Finally, a few years back, I had the opportunity to see The Piano almost fifteen years after its release. The chance to watch her new tale of John Keats and love Fanny Brawne at the Toronto International Film Festival couldn't be passed up. Campion herself was there to introduce the Special Presentation screening and spoke about how this story was pure to her. Spanning two years of first love between a beloved poet and his muse, the tale is at the same time both heartwarmingly genuine in its passion and crushingly tragic in its aftermath. She gets the period style just right and brings out two amazing turns from her leads; there are very little, if any, faults with Bright Star.The story that takes place in the 19th century, a time where a man couldn't even conceive of the notion to marry unless he had a job and influx of money. When the man in question is a poet, you can imagine how hard a feat that can be—his work relying solely on critical acclaim and the success of his books—weak at best if one shop owner is to be believed that he bought twenty to sell and none had left his gaze. Living with a friend and fellow poet, Keats and Charles Armitage Brown find themselves with a lot of time on their hands to craft and create their next best artwork. The two rent space from the Brawne family, well Brown does since he is the one with money, and spend most moments alone behind closed doors seemingly doing very little of anything. Eventually, curiosity, and being fed-up with the sarcastic cruelty of Brown, makes young Fanny decide to meet Keats and gauge his make-up. The man is a virtual recluse except when caring for his deathly ill brother, using all his free time to think and compose. This meeting intrigues them both and is the first step to their budding relationship together, one that sees her critiquing his words before eventually being the subject of them.Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw, as Brawne and Keats respectively, completely embody their characters and bring them to life on screen. They know their motivations and their place in the world, she falling in love with him, knowing he can't love her due to his place in society's hierarchy, and he falling for her, knowing he can't until he sells his words and earns the right to. Social restraints notwithstanding, the two begin a (not so) secret union of love built on mutual respect and affection. Both very young, this is their first relationship, and one of the greatest details of the film is in portraying it just that way. When Cornish and Whishaw kiss, they do so gently and slow, closed mouth and no movement. They are unsure what to do and that naïve innocence makes the courting so real and effective to watch. Their love is so strong that any adversity is made so much more relevant and all encompassing to their world. When Keats must leave to write abroad, they both write letters, feeling the emptiness of loss until a reply is received. Brawne is so smitten and taken by his words of true love, how he would rather live a lifetime of three days with her as a butterfly than fifty common years weighed down by responsibilities of earth, she begins capturing the flying creatures, making her bedroom a sanctuary for them to fly about.Two years together and a bond unbreakable, their love is beautiful in its simplicity. Always so pure, (is Campion ever correct on that statement), and childlike in reverence, they want nothing more than to be together. Her parents allow the relationship to continue even though they know he must become a success before letting her leave them and the only real blockade comes from Keats' friend Brown, played wonderfully by Paul Schneider adding the comic relief and a bit of conflict. Wanting the space and time to do his work with Keats, each time Brawne comes by to steal her love away, Brown is always quick with a quip to put her down and complain about the intrusion. But it is a playful relationship they have, as Brawne is never shy to shoot back with a biting word timed to perfection. Schneider infuses the role with so much heart, as he usually does, in his love for Keats and friendship with Fanny. When true tragedy strikes, he becomes a beacon of strength, for the most part, and holds himself responsible in keeping his poet friend safe.Bright Star is a romance for sure, and its bittersweet ending only bolsters that fact. Nothing can come between the love both Cornish and Whishaw portray in the film. The hardships that hit them make their bond ever stronger, realizing how much they need each other. Risking the rumors and talking behind their backs of a love frowned upon and socially rejected, nothing else matters as they are their own world, living together through it all, even with death knocking at the door. The metaphor of the butterflies resonates so fully when you look at the short time Keats and Brawne have with one another on this earth. They take that time and live without regret, knowing that without the other they would have nothing. Any credibility in his poetry comes from his feelings for her and her purpose for going on lives within him. So subtle and immense in its details, Jane Campion has crafted a romance to engross and affect all those who take the time to watch it. Highly recommended for sure, its simplicity hides its immense emotional worth, making for a film not to be taken lightly.",Bright Star
27,cultfilmfan,Bright Star,7,14 January 2010,"Bright Star takes place in early 19th century England and focuses on the true love story of poet John Keats and a local woman named Fanny Brawne. The film shows the distant, yet growing relationship between the two of them and obstacles including other people and John's health which comes in the way of their relationship. Seeing as Bright Star is based upon a now famous 19th century poet, you would expect a film about him to be obviously poetic and Bright Star is. There are scenes that just focus on the flowers, gardens and nature around the characters and there are some scenes which seem to take a pause from the story and just focus on beautiful and inspiring landscapes and there are also voice over scenes with one of the actors reading John Keats poems. As a period piece, Bright Star does everything right. The filming locations, the costumes and sets are all very believable and it does sometimes feel like it is taking place during that time period. The acting by Abbie Cornish (Fanny), Ben Whishaw (John) and John's friend Mr. Brown (Paul Schneider) are also very good. I particularly liked Paul Schneider as the arrogant and quite full of himself Mr. Brown, who I think is well developed and becomes more and more interesting as the film goes along and in the first half of the film he is also the bringer of comedic relief to the film because of his high opinion of himself and I think it was captured very well by Paul Schneider and I would have to say is definitely an underrated performance. While the beauty and look of Bright Star really impressed me, as it started to move along, I was having some problems with the story and there were also times were Abbie Cornish'a performance was getting a little too melodramatic for me in the second half. One problem I had with the story was that I did not really find the relationship between John and Fanny to be believable. There always seemed to be some distance between them and it was also like the fact of getting closer, or showing any kind of love, or intimacy was just uncomfortable for them and they seemed unsure of themselves. Once you watch the film you will notice some of the complications which arise from the relationship (some I briefly mentioned above), but I had a hard time picking out any tenderness, or anything really moving about their relationship. Maybe this is just a problem I had personally, but watching it, I did have a problem with it because it just didn't feel real to me. And as I said, I know there were complications, but I do not really see as how that could affect the relationship so much. Perhaps some of the problems lie in the film's script for this particular problem I had with the film because I did enjoy the performances (until they started to get melodramatic) and I think the actors were just working with the material they were given. The melodramatic parts bothered me because I have never been a fan of that style of acting, or writing. You know the kind, where everything is really emotional from the music to some over the top emotional acting with the actors almost seeming like they are forcing themselves to be that way in the scene and it does not feel real, or believable. From the acting to the music, the film really felt like it wanted you to pity these characters and their circumstances, but when a film feels forced and like it is coming on too strong, like this one was, it is hard to feel anything at all, other than annoyance at it. I still did find enough to like about Bright Star and I think where it fails is in the development of the characters and some of the acting and music in the second half. It is still technically a well made and gorgeous looking film, but for me at least, I would say this one would be a rental and not a go to the theatre type of movie to see. I know there is an audience for this type of film, who will find what I am saying to be untrue and just a waste of time writing for me and reading on their part of the review. However, I think anyone into the classic British period piece films will probably find something to like in it and others may appreciate it, like I did, but more for the style and way it was made than the source material.",Bright Star
28,Likes_Ninjas90,Heartfelt and shattering in its emotion,9,28 December 2009,"In 1818, a young woman named Frances 'Fanny' Brawne (Abbie Cornish), designed clothes, while living next door to one of the most celebrated poets of all time, John Keats (Ben Whishaw). Keats and his colleague Charles Armitage Brown (Paul Schneider) were working together to write poetry at a time where it was not taken seriously as a true profession. Keats' work was heavily criticised and sold poorly. It was during this period that his brother also died of tuberculosis. Throughout the film, Fanny shares her sympathy for Keats and is gradually intrigued by his work, asking him to teach her how to write poetry. Brown shares his contempt for her, viewing her as a distraction. Fanny's family disapprove as well, stating that Keats' cannot afford to marry her because he does not have a suitable profession. In spite of these objections, a slow and tentative relationship between Fanny and Keats begins to grow.Knowing that the poet John Keats died at just twenty-five, or not having a thorough understanding of his work, is little reason not to see Bright Star. Amidst so many superfluous romantic-comedies released in Hollywood this year, Campion's film is quiet, tender and restraint in the deliberation of its romance. The leisurely pace of the film might not suit some, but it is with this control that Campion, as the screenwriter and director, allows the film to slowly unravel and become more emotionally rewarding when its screen couple eventually embrace. Though the element of class, in having both family and colleagues disapprove of their love, might sound familiar, it is through this confliction and eventual resolution that a stronger appreciation for poetry itself can arise for both the characters and the audience. It is fascinating as well to consider that poetry, and Keats himself, was given little worth or merit. As the film progresses it becomes more obvious that the inclusion of the title of Keats' poem at the beginning, 'a thing of beauty is a joy forever', is an echo of one's timeless appreciation for his work and the enduring love that is felt by these two characters. It is a subtle and smartly written film that does not need to overstate its themes to remain deeply emotional and very moving.Campion's appreciation for the imagery of Keats' work is further evident from the way the film has been meticulously photographed. This is one of the most visually outstanding films in recent years. The level of authenticity applied to the art direction of the houses and the costumes is splendid. As too is the films calculated use of colour and lighting, which beautifully illuminates the costumes, sets and actors on screen. The sight of Fanny standing in a doorway in a white dress, holding a blue flower in her hand, or lying on her bed as the white drapes flutter with the wind, are two of the most sumptuous images in the film. Abbie Cornish is the heart of the film, not only because she has been so radiantly photographed, but because her performance convinces thoroughly. Along with her perfect accent, the warmth and gentility she shows, deserves recognition. This is a really sincere and often emotional performance by a young, understated actress. The supporting cast is fine too, particularly Paul Schneider, who is quite nasty and repelling at times, testimony to the power of his performance.Bright Star is a beautifully realised film, one so visually striking that it holds an emotional core almost entirely through its artistry alone. The quality of the photography in this film cannot be understated and is a true reflection of Campion's skill as a filmmaker and her understanding of the visual qualities held in Keats' own written words. Most significantly however, the compelling nature of the love story, impeccably performed by the cast and subtly written to reflect the values of the period, is heartfelt and shattering in its emotion.",Bright Star

For what it is, which is an exquisitely realised period romance, Bright Star is perfect.If you would rather your period romances dealt with more difficult social issues, did not have to wait for primitive communication systems, or took less care with costumes, sets, etc, then Bright Star may disappoint.What may surprise you is how much of Keats' language is familiar; he's as modern a part of fluent English as Shakespeare. Jane Campion has taken the liberty of filling in the gaps where Keats' letters to Fanny Brawne haven't survived, and the joins are barely visible.Not challenging in any way, but moving, if you allow it, nonetheless.",Bright Star
30,doctorsmoothlove,Supernova,2,15 November 2009,"So you're John Keats. Your life's work requires that you spend time indoors or occasionally outside simply thinking. These thoughts, transcribed to paper, are sold as poetry but few indulge. After scathing reviews, you take residence in a home inhabited by a curious young Fanny Brawne and her family. As a (male) poet, you have little exposure to anyone who isn't a bookstore clerk, but especially not women. You fall in love with your neighbor as you tutor her between books. Is everything about you? Honestly, no it isn't. During your life, very little is in your control. Not even your health.John Keats was never in control of anything in his life. He was swept about by financial duties, family collapse, and disease for his twenty-five years. This film of his later life Bright Star is a modern apology-of-sorts to Keats. He is finally the star of his own film. His control of our reaction is only limited by history and directorial contrivances.And what contrivances they are! What little we see of Keats in Bright Star is limited to fawning over Brawne, but not readily opening up to her and reciting lines of poems he's supposedly written. The decision to portray his love life over his intellectual life isn't inherently limiting. But Jane Campion's film fails to place us inside any part of his life. Other than the wikipedia articles I referenced composing this review, I still know nothing of Keats. We never see him silently writing. It's like he is there to be Brawne's love interest. Since he is more famous than she is, his character is the piston of the narrative. Brawne is under developed to a caricature. It's like Twilight for adults.If the actors were portraying regular people in a modern era, I would recommend it. While watching this film, I felt like I was watching people in costume acting in a Lifetime period piece. The portrayal doesn't work in a biopic. Milk is a much better biopic that could also be considered a romance film. Sean Penn and Gus Van Sant recreate Harvey Milk's life in its entirety. That's a good movie. These types of films are to be informative, or at least compelling, and this one isn't. Keats love life and tragic preemptive death is easy inspiration for a film. Why not remove the historical backdrop and adapt this storyline to modern day. Now no one can direct a proper Bright Star until a decade or so passes.",Bright Star
31,diane-34,Love's path is curious and meandering,10,19 December 2009,"Diane and I saw Bright Star yesterday at SX Luna and were captivated by Jane Campion's latest and some would say best film. We were both engrossed in this tragic story peopled with characters that were unexpected; perhaps knowing more than I did about John Keats life would have unblinkered my eyes to the general story but that clarity would, perhaps, have left me to feel dissatisfied with the portrayals.As it was I luxuriated in the slow unfolding story of love between these two very different people. People in the audience left the theatre immediately after the credits started to roll so I believe I am safe in saying that this slowness was not appreciated by everyone present. We were impressed with all the film's actors; we both thought that Campion had explored the many nuances of this rather strange relationship between a man of genius and a young woman at the doorstep of adulthood and who, therefore, is unsure of all that she feels.The relationship between Keats and his friend plays a large role in the film, further mudding the waters of feelings between the major players. That relationship is best left to individual viewers because I found it complex and therefore many sided.Make every effort to see Bright Star, you will not be disappointed.",Bright Star
32,moviemanMA,The Power of Poetry,8,29 September 2009,"In Jane Campion's latest film Bright Star, we bare witness to just that. We see the power of one's words and the effect they can have on the people who encounter them, in both a positive and negative light. More specifically, we examine the relationship between Fanny Brawne and John Keats, one of the major poets of the Romantic movement.Keats, played by Ben Whishaw, is residing with his good friend Charles Brown (Paul Schneider). The two sit for hours on end trying to come up with lines of poetry as well as letters and even a play. There work is interrupted periodically by Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), a stylish girl who is renting part of Mr. Brown's house with her mother and two siblings. Mr. Brown does not care so much for Fanny because she does not care for him, but also because she distracts Keats from his work.Fanny makes her own clothes, helps out around the house, and goes out dancing at her mother's request. When she too becomes distracted by Mr. Keats, she decides to read his published work. She becomes infatuated by him. The two slowly but surely start a love affair that will consume both of them entirely, but alas Keats feels that his lack of income makes him not the marrying type. Letters are sent back and forth, poetry is written, and long walks become enchanting and everlasting memories.As nice as the story is I couldn't help but notice the slow pace of the first half of the film. There was a lot of build up that escalated into something that wasn't disappointing but wasn't as fulfilling as it should have been. I wanted more drama, more romance, and less time flirting with the idea of romance.As slow as the film seemed at times I couldn't help but notice the beautiful photography and art direction. It had an elegant style and really captured not just the physical attributes associated with 19th century England but the atmosphere was almost palpable at times. The dance scenes, social gatherings, and the change of seasons really gave the film life.The principle roles of Fanny, Keats, and Brown worked very well together on screen. It's clear how each character feels about the other. I was especially surprised by Whishaw and Schneider, whom I have seen in a few other roles that have no comparison to the ones they play here (Whishaw in Perfume: A Story of Murder and I'm Not There, and Schneider in Elizabethtown and Lars and the Real Girl). Both are talented actors who prove they can tackle any role.I recommend this to those seeking a good film with romance, poetry, beautiful images and scenery, and those who are not afraid or embarrassed to cry a little (it's kind of a chick-flick in that regard). It's a bit slow at times but pays off in the end.",Bright Star
33,rgcustomer,Do not waste your time,6,14 November 2009,"I know.I know I'm supposed to have these great emotions well up at the end. But when the characters are utterly boring and two-dimensional (not to mention written into history, obliterating any suspense) it's not my responsibility to make up feelings about them. That's the filmmaker's job -- one she seems to have overlooked.I felt absolutely nothing for either one of them. They come together for no reason, stay together for no reason, are separated for no reason (unless we're to believe Brown is either gay or just that much of a jerk, or both ... too bad this character is just a throw-away). So when the inevitable end comes, I feel nothing whatsoever, in what is supposed to be the climactic scene. Or... actually what I felt was embarrassed for poor Abbie, acting her heart out, for such a lifeless story.Further, it may interest the filmmakers to know that their film proves that while there may be a written language called English, there is no such spoken language. When spoken, there is British, and there is American (and I am neither). So there's that, but certainly for no other reason than this was a film about poetry, it should have been subtitled. Poems are equally a visual experience, as aural. I am completely at a loss to determine why this film receives high marks from so many reviewers.Regarding historical accuracy, I'm told: (1) Abbie and Keats were probably not that intimate, or she would have caught TB from him (2) Abbie probably would not have understood much of Keats' poetry (3) Abbie didn't spend the rest of her life pining for Keats, but married and had three children (4) Brown was probably not hostile towards Abbie's feelings for Keats. That said, although I tend to be harsher than most on accuracy, I don't think any of those things crosses the line.",Bright Star

35,rooee,Pretty vase,5,27 May 2010,"Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) may be brusque compared with the musing poets next door, but she's a sensitive, sensual girl, fragile as an autumn leaf. Her mother regards her with pity; her brother with a kind of concerned awe, the way one looks at a butterfly.One wonders whether Jane Campion's first feature since 2003's In the Cut intends to make the point that romantic love is as light, transient, and frail as the aforementioned butterfly; or perhaps that it exists on an alternative plane, where the rigours of real life don't get a look-in. (This would explain why Fanny seems unfazed by the chill of an early nineteenth century in the depth of winter.) There's an interesting love story here – but unfortunately it's the one that's marginalised, between John Keats and Mr Brown. For all his cruelty in disregarding her ability to feel - a jealousy performed with skillful agony by American actor Paul Schneider – Mr Brown kind of has a point when he asserts that Fanny only knows how to ""flirt and sew"". Abbie Cornish is a very talented performer, embodying all the youth and naïveté of her character. If only that character amounted to more than mood swings and glances.Bright Star is as handsome and empty as a vase, failing to capture the essence of love or the power of poetry.",Bright Star
36,alainenglish,Well-made picture on an important poet,8,10 November 2009,"""Bright Star"" is the latest film from director Australian director Jane Campion and is about the final years in the life of Romantic poet John Keats. Campion was inspired by the letters Keats wrote to Fanny Brawne, a neighbour of his with whom he had a short affair before succumbing to tuberculosis at the age of twenty-five.The film is notable for not seeming like a typical period drama and on focusing on individual personal details. In an interesting move, Campion has toned down the potential eroticism of the central love affair, and made the relationship as much an emotional connection as a romantic one. We are shown that Keats NEEDS Fanny Brawne, even as their separate financial circumstances drive them apart and away from each other. This film would be ideal for English students studying up on John Keats and his poetry - it seems to have been written and produced with this audience clearly in mind.Considered one of the finest young acting talents to emerge in recent years, Ben Wishaw really gets under the skin of the haunted, tortured Keats, capturing both the intuitive intellect and emotional frailty of the man. It's Abbie Cornish, though, who really sells this picture. As Fanny Brawne, she comes across as witty and down-to-earth in an unpretentious, almost contemporary way. It's easy to imagine women of a similar age and perhaps younger relating to Fanny Brawne as she falls in love and yet remains the stronger of the two of them in the relationship. There are no standouts among the supporting performers, but they do provide a strong backup to the two main characters.Campion has shot middle England in a similar way to how she shot New Zealand in ""The Piano"". There are rarely any shots in sunlight here, England (even in the countryside) is shown to be a grimy, waterlogged land, where life and it's attendant diseases strive hard to flourish.Don't be put off by the excessive hype and it's period setting, this romantic and enjoyable film deserves to be seen by as many people as possible.",Bright Star
37,yris2002,A delicate touch to depict the ravishing power of words and silence,8,19 June 2010,"When a director handles with English writers' biographies, it is easy to fall into the clichè, when one deals with the biography of a romantic English poet, it could be still easier to fall into the manneristic-romantic, and the risk of disappointment is always lurking. Although I have a strong feeling for this kind of movies, in a way that whenever a shot on some English countryside appears, I could lose my sense of reality, I can objectively say that the fore-mentioned risk is totally and thankfully absent in ""Bright Star"", which on the contrary stands out for its sober and delicate handling of the short life of John Keats and of his deep love for Fanny Brown. It's through Fanny's eyes we get to know Keats' inner world and poetry, the verbal beauty of his poems, full of pathos, inner longing for life and death, passionate, whereas their love story remains almost platonic, fixed on a perfect level, where nothing can contaminate their deep communion. And still Jane Campion has the merit not to heat up their story, and to depict subtle, almost evanescent moments of their encounters. Very intense interpretations are offered by the two leading actors, but I would say that every character has a precise and significant meaning inside the movie. Easily to be perceived as a slow picture, Jane Campion gets to convey through a movie, which requires motion in itself, the slowness required by poetry. Poetry , writing, love require time, patience, and silence. The silent moments between Keats and Fanny are as intense and evocative as when they recite poetry, even the discrete, silent presence of Fanny's brother makes a sense. Wonderful, to say the least, the shots with Fanny lying on a lavender field, and the one with butterflies inside her room: truly ravishing.",Bright Star
38,Eternality,"Bright Star can be appreciated on its own terms and for Cornish's excellent performance, but only a select few can fully embrace (and enjoy) what Campion has accomplished.",7,16 March 2011,"Jane Campion continues her fascination with the period drama. Her latest film, Bright Star, premiered at Cannes and is in the running for an Oscar for Best Costume Design. Best known for the acclaimed picture, The Piano (1993), Campion now shifts her attention to John Keats (Ben Whishaw), a famous English poet who lived in the 19th century. Falling short of making a biographical picture of Keats that only literature scholars will salivate on, Campion decided to film Bright Star from the perspective of Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), the woman who fell in love with Keats in a secret (and forbidden) relationship.Keats was a dreamer. He wrote poetry as a form of expressing hypothetical desires – the wish for a perfect world and an utopian understanding of what constituted beauty and love. He had little income and remained an outsider who was oblivious to cultural norms. In short, the world was himself and he was his own world. On the other hand, Brawne was a realist. She was born into a middle-class family, lived satisfactorily within her own means, and passed her time through stitching elaborately designed clothing.Her love affair with Keats grew slowly with occasional chance meetings and blossomed into a comfortable embracement that appeared awkward, at best, to outsiders. The film's other major character was Charles Brown (Paul Schneider), a zealous and overprotective friend of Keats, who tried to separate them. Campion draws out the tensions among the three main characters without going overboard into theatrics. Her direction is sensitive and understated. And this is important for a picture as refined as Bright Star.Edited with a pace equivalent to a morning stroll in the wilderness, Bright Star may be too refined for mainstream tastes as Campion indulges in a visual style that emphasizes on the regality of the period e.g. stately costumes worn by the leads, and the blissful nature of life through silent sequences in which characters interact non-verbally. A good example is a sequence which shows Keats and Brawne flirting with each other as they walk behind the latter's younger sister, Toots. Whenever Toots turns around, they would freeze in a comical position.In addition, Campion's screenplay is more ""textual"" than most films of similar genre. At best, the dialogue between the characters is poetic and beautifully written. Sometimes it gets too abstract though, and coupling with the thick English accent used by the characters, it may be difficult to interpret what was said. Bright Star can be appreciated on its own terms and for Cornish's excellent performance, but only a select few can fully embrace (and enjoy) what Campion has accomplished. I am most definitely not one of them. GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Bright Star
39,PipAndSqueak,Ridiculous,2,6 December 2009,"I would have given this a 4/10 score except, the more I think about it the less there is to say in commendation of it. The principle problem is that Campion has chosen to write the script herself with only the aid of Andrew Motion. No wonder this is so off target. If you are at all interested in history, or God forbid, Keats himself, stay well away. It is a truly appalling representation of a real person's life and work. It gives no sense of the deprivations suffered by Keats. You'd think he was a spoilt brat pretending to live the life of an occasional letter writer, in a well lit, airy rural setting, with Brawne depicted like the 21st Century prick-tease that chimes more with modern day sentimentality.

40,badajoz-1,Campion's folly,3,17 November 2009,"The heroine tells us early on - I sew, I design and make my own clothes, and I can make money at it (although we never see her make a penny!) - another biopic of Coco Chanel? No, it's a film apparently about John Keats the poet, but it isn't, it's a movie about a couple passionately but platonically in love. Only really it's a film about a young woman called Fanny Brawn, set during the Regency in England, who fell in love with John Keats and we know this because they wrote a lot of letters, which have survived, to each other, and he wrote an ode to her. Only again it isn't, it's another modern feminist film about a modern girl, feisty, determined, manipulative to get her own way (including lying a lot), somehow repressed by the early nineteenth century society she is living in (exactly the same misalliance as Coco Avant Chanel). Why don't so-called feminist directors and writers write about now if they want to put over portraits of modern women, not load it all on to figures in the past? Abbie Cornish survives it all to give a sound performance, but Ben Whishaw disappears in the soap dressed up as painfully slow art-house cinema - why and where is it shown he is a great poet? Ms Campion, whose pretty dire 'The Piano' was so overpraised, has misfired yet again with a mediocre script and pretentious 'arty, beautiful pictures of flowers and seasons' direction (note to her, watch Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' for beautiful seasonal use of colour!) to indicate great poetry - no, it doesn't work! There are enough costumes to dress all the Bennett girls four times over if 'Pride and Prejudice' is remade, but I must say the best scene is Kerry Fox as Fanny's mother baking to perfection, which demonstrates that women performed to their best at what they were allowed to do at that time - great. The right message about the right time - pity the rest of the film didn't do that!",Bright Star
41,Michael Fargo,Romance,7,19 September 2009,"I'd be surprised anyone would wander into ""Bright Star"" accidentally, so if you purchased a ticket to see something about one of the Romantic Poets, you'll get your money's worth.As Campion's career has matured her edge (some would say ""feminist"" edge) has become more tempered. In the case of ""Bright Star"" it's nearly absent. The heroine here is all frills and cleverness turned out well by Abbie Cornish. One of literary history's more tarnished characters, she's simply a modern girl by today's standards. Her transformation through loving one of the Romantic's doesn't get her very far. She decides to read some books...well, at least she says she wants to to read them, but whether she does more than memorize some of her lover's poetry, the film doesn't address.The world here is so small that only once do we get mention of the scandal the relationship created. Her mother mentions Fanny has become the subject of a lot of gossip, but we never see who's saying what.Instead the film focuses solely on the relationship between Fanny Brawne and John Keats with some heavy foreshadowing of the illness that befell him and the relationship. And the only sharp edge here is directed towards Keats' friend, Charles Armitrage Brown. I'm not sure it's a fair depiction, but it adds some leavening to all the dreamy imagery.And it's beautifully filmed with breathtaking formal compositions, appropriate for a film about Keats. But it's also given little more weight than a lot of very ordinary stories of young love, which is probably the most shocking thing about the film since its made by a director known for creating complex stories of feminine struggle.Ben Whitshaw as Keats acquits himself here after his performance in ""Brideshead Revisited"" (no small feat). And the entire cast is very watchable. However, I had time to study the set decor, color combinations and construction of the gauzy costumes and thought it would be better titled ""Martha Stewart's Bright Star"" (and actually, that's a compliment).",Bright Star

Yes Charles Brown comes across as abrasive Scot and his seduction of the maid Abigail is surely thrown in for good measure when throughout the film John Keats is perceived as an honourable and kind but poor gentleman who did not make the most of his opportunity with the beloved Fanny. Great great acting by Abbie Cornish and Ben Bishaw on a par as a movie with Young Victoria and Painted Veil. This is indeed a very slow moving drama without a Plot because there does not need to be one. I had to read up on Wiki afterwards and watch the movie again to get the mood of Bright Star the sonnet, now I have grasped it, so should you! Nothing bad about this movie in any way but many non Brits and non literature folk are bound to be bored with the movie out of ignorance not for any other reason. As commented before, there are some great one-liners to be remembered but reference to playing football in 1818 I thought was a little unnecessary quite early on in the film football wasn't created or invented until later that century.

43,patryk-czekaj,Not bright enough...,5,5 October 2010,"19th century England. Young woman named Fanny Browne meets a poet, John Keats. They instantly fall in love. But as it happens in many movies of that type, they need to overcome serious adversities, including main character's best friend, who does everything to keep them away from each other. Finally, when everything seems to be going well, they relationship is halted by a sharp death of Keats. I, myself, am not a big fan of romantic dramas and I didn't expect to be delighted by this particular one. Unfortunately, that's what happened as I tried to feel the magic, shining on me from the cinema screen. Maybe the fact that the script was written by a woman (Jane Campion) makes it harder for a man to understand the whole idea of the movie. I'm not trying to be negative or offensive, but this picture made me feel that I'm watching just another, simply tragic, love story. The only thing that stroke me was the death of John Keats. Seriously, I knew he was sick, I knew he was in agony, but looking at the title I thought that probably he will get a second chance. In the end, I even felt compassion for lady Browne. Surprisingly, the well-rounded plot gave me the impression that this disturbing drama will never end, effectively bolting me to the cinema seat for two hours. What's more, there aren't many special or visual effects, but, as a positive, the photography is on a very high level. One has a taste of England at the time of intellectual bloom. To be honest, the only two things that I liked about this indie movie was acting and music. I must say, Ben Whishaw charmed me as a fragile young man, who had so much grace and fondness for poetry. Also, the character of Mr. Brown, Keats' friend, was the brightest one of all. He was crude, arrogant, possessive, and I actually felt like he was the only person making any sense. He knew that John, madly in love, wasn't able to write poetry, because of the young lady's visits. As for the music, the original score composed by Mark Bradshaw was one of the best in the previous year. Made with passion, very relaxing and finely accordant to the scenes. What else can I say, it's probably one of the most boring costume dramas since Marie Antoinette (2006).

44,fablesofthereconstru-1,True,10,21 October 2009,"The critical reception for John Keats' long poem ""Endymion"" was generally poor; ""the coarse-bred son of a livery stable keeper""(what his contemporary William Butler Yeats called him) never knew real success and died a failure at the age of twenty-five. Yeats denigrated Keats' work as being akin to ""luxuriant song"", too introspective; his poems, nothing but manifestations of his own frustrations. If Keats wrote mere songs, then ""Endymion"" was his album; it was long, unlike a 45, a short poem, and in ""Bright Star"", the filmmaker nimbly shows how great literary works, now relegated to academic circles, once were at the center of ""popular culture"", when Fanny Brawne(Abby Cornish) dispatches her younger brother and sister to pick up a copy at the bookshop. The look of anticipation on the little girl's face as she requests the title to the bookseller, seems dislocated, despite our awareness of the film's time and place. Such is the general public's disdain for literature so acute, it's hard to fathom Victorian poetry as being fashionable. At the same time, because the filmmaker presents Keats as a reclusive, but congenial rock star, the moviegoer does comprehend the little girl's conspiratorial spirit of her little adventure, since she too agrees with her older sis that the poet is cute, and is eager to hear his latest ""songs"" too. The act of unwrapping the book, which she performs for Fanny, is like unsleeving a vinyl record. Her mouth becomes a needle; her voice, and the amplification of her voice, correlates to a stereo unit, and although you still can hear Keats' greatness through the small girl's ""equipment"", the words truly become sublime when Fanny reads them. With this scene, the appreciation of good literature, can be extrapolated through the language of rock and roll fandom. The two girls could be swooning over the New Romantic band Spandau Ballet.Fanny Brawne was no intellectual, but she had breeding, and a talent for making her own outfits. It was clothes more suited for the city than the countryside, a point that the film makes by placing her in the most rustic of tableaux, where the young girl looks conspicuously overdressed, walking, perhaps, with too much ceremony. Whereas John Keats resembles a proto-rock star, his lover is analogous to the glamorous girlfriend, the proto-supermodel, who shouldn't be taken seriously by anybody. Posing as a serious poetry student, Keats' friend and patron, Charles Armitage Brown(Paul Schneider), susses out Fanny's interest in the poetic arts as nothing more than a romantic ploy, when he catches the ""clothes horse"" in a lie about having read John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"", a poem without rhymes, a much more arduous read than Keats' work, and a long piece that Charles guesses Fanny would struggle with. Charles underestimates her(and his friend's work, conveyed through the artistic juxtaposition of rhyming and non-rhyming poetry), and maybe ""Bright Star"" too, unintentionally, by the filmmaker's reduction of Fanny into some girl in a proto-music video. The filmmaker visualizes Keats' line about being butterflies from a letter that the self-exiled poet wrote to his flame, who is subordinated to his imagery, like a model. Neither ""groupie"" nor sophisticate, Fanny reads ""Endymion"" and knows immediately that the critics are wrong; she knows Keats isn't an ""idiot"". Since Fanny is just a reader, labelling her opinion as being contrarian would be inappropriate, because she reads emotionally, not critically. Her love of Keats, and his work, is, to quote Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet, ""True"", a song that Yeats would probably have labeled as ""luxuriant"", as well.",Bright Star

The hystorical research is well done. There are some characters lost, but I can understand the difficulty to concentrate an entire life in two hours.

My instincts were well rewarded because this was one of the best movies I've seen. It was a very well constructed film detailing the relationship of the Romantic poet John Keats with his lover Fanny Brawne, as well as Keats' relationship with his friend and patron Charles Brown.The actors were relatively unknown to me. I'm pretty sure I've seen Paul Schneider, who played Charles Brown, in other films. But Abbie Cornish, who played Fanny, and Ben Whishaw, who played Keats, are new to me. They were great. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job.Jane Campion, the Director, brought the period to life. And the character development was outstanding. The viewer really felt a connection to the characters in the film, even minor characters, like Fanny's mother & siblings, were highly engaging. Fanny's younger sister was the most adorable little girl in film since Gretl in ""The Sound of Music"".The music and mood of the movie fit the period and subject perfectly. I was mesmerized from the beginning to the end of this great film. I think I'll go back and see it again. It was that good.The movie ended, while the credits rolled, with Whishaw reciting ""Ode to a Nightingale"" set to classical music. The audience stayed up until the last credit rolled. It was a nice touch to finish the movie with.This movie will likely be the definitive film about Romantic poets. Maybe Campion will direct a movie about Byron in Greece or Shelley in Italy.

If plot depends on conflict, there is almost no plot here; this is a plodding meditation on sorrow and misfortune. For a film that purports to dramatize the greatest love of one of the Romantic poets, never have I seen a romance depicted so dispassionately (maybe it's got something to do with the almost complete absence of a score—how do we know when to well up with emotion and weep if there's no crescendo of music to cue our emotional responses?). Jane Campion seems to think that having Keats and Fanny Brawne recite Keats' poems to each other can supply poignant dialogue, but it results in a leaden, artificial—and ultimately embarrassing—excuse for a screenplay.",Bright Star
49,PeachesIR,"Beautiful, delicate, romantic (like Keats himself)",9,10 May 2018,"I was very impressed with ""Bright Star,"" directed by Jane Campion. I've watched this movie at least three times. The acting is excellent, and the actors (Cornish, Whishaw, and all the supporting cast) realistically both the romantic passion of English ladies and gentlemen of this period and their restraint and adherence to social convention. When Fanny Brawne and John Keats express their love and devotion, they do so delicately and beautifully, with poetry (exquisite lines written by the great poet and delivered so hauntingly by Whishaw), surreptitious kisses, notes and subtle gestures. Not the garish grabbing and vulgar patter we see today. Campion's recreation of the English countryside and its slow-paced lifestyle is perfect. Cornish's Fanny is overwrought with emotion over her love for Keats, and even though it seems excessive to jaded moderns, I believe that was common for the time. Her feelings spill over. She doesn't know where to put them. She's also a feisty, determined, creative (she designs her own clothes and accessories) young woman with a zest for life and love. Keats is more introspective and quiet, but you feel how his love for her builds and deepens. ""Bright Star"" brings the Romantic period to life quite believably, and will encourage you to read Keats' poetry and more about the lives of these individuals.",Bright Star

51,banzanbon,Weakest of all Campion films...,4,26 July 2011,"I'm a fan of Jane Campion's and even when Oscar & Lucinda were panned, I still liked the movie. Bright Star however really is her weakest work to date. I was looking forward to it but the casting is all wrong to me and the storyline is wobbly and whatever substantial bits there are, are all carried by Abby Cornish who is the best thing in the whole film. Ben Whishaw is a decent enough actor but he's a stick figure in this role and his interpretation of Keats' 'anemia' is simply forgettable. Paul Schneider emotes and overacts his little heart out, though he pulls off a darn fine Scottish accent. The rest of the cast try but the way the script reads, they are all a sort of wispy and devitalized 'characters' vs. personages. It's as if Campion told everyone to be as spent as Keats! The cumbersome rhythm of the film is also just annoying and compounded by the deafening lack of a complementary theme music. All in all, All the actors and the director have seen better days. See it if you will but...I give this film a disappointed yawn.",Bright Star

The final scene of the movie with the Cornish reciting the poetry was a really good idea that was executed well. Enjoyed the Cornish/Schneider banter even if Schneiders accent was never clear. Jane Campion really returned to form with this movie. It was by far her best movie since The Piano. I liked Portrait of Lady but it was a step down from The Piano and of course In the Cut was not received well at all. The cinematography, costumes and sets were all top notch. Abbie Cornish was nominated for several awards for her performance but not enough. Oscar and BAFTA nominations were deserved for this very promising young actress.",Bright Star
53,mamlukman,"slow, passionless, pointless",2,5 October 2009,"Maybe there are two films--the one ecstatic reviewers saw, and the one I saw. Jane Campion seems to be both the writer and director, which probably is the problem. ""Where's the screenplay???"" would be the first thing an objective third party would say. Slow? Slow enough to put me and several people around me to sleep in the first half. Characters are just sort of plunked down without explanation. Yeah, I've heard of Keats, but how well known was he at that time? Why didn't have any money if he had published some books already? Who in the world was this Brown guy--hanger on, mentor, sycophant, old friend? What? Are we to expect that Fanny and Keats fell in love after exchanging a few snatches of dialog? Esp. this dialog--no wit, no flair, no comedy. Nice photography at times, but Hampstead Heath? I've been to Hampstead Heath, and this is no Hampstead Heath. And do daffodils really bloom year round there? Frankly, it looked like Australia, but the credits said England. Could be. But it was yet another distraction. It was yet another irritating movie where the characters refuse to reveal what they're thinking to each other--even though they're in ""love"" and live in the same house. So what's the point? No tension in the ""story."" No suspense. It just plods along, and Keats dies. A lot more background in explaining the characters would have been helpful. How did Fanny's mother get money? Did they own the house or rent, too? Since there is no plot to follow, your mind wanders off to this level of detail. Avoid at all costs.",Bright Star
54,cinemaniac2002,"Hauntingly poetic, cinematically beautiful",10,30 January 2013,"I had the pleasure of attending a screening of Bright Star with Director Jane Campion and rascal Mr. Brown (Paul Schneider) - who, by the way, is even more handsome in person. I thoroughly enjoyed this quiet, elegant and romantic film. It is the embodiment of romance in every way possible. This story really seems to capture the essence of John Keats and the tragic love affair that was cut short with his only true love - Fanny Brawne (played brilliantly by Abbie Cornish). It is heartbreaking to watch how this relationship progresses, from the hostility and jealousy of his friend, Charles Brown to the physical frailty that Keats endured. It is a Romeo and Juliet scenario in the sense that their inability to be together was based upon the moral code of the as yet to become Victorian era.The film provides great insight into the astounding beauty of Keats' poetry that is emotionally moving well beyond his years. Fanny's steadfast and pure devotion is doomed, but she never wavers. Like him, she has the soul of an artist and her chosen outlet is clothing design. There has been speculation as to whether Brown had sexual feelings for Keats. Reading between the lines it appears as though that may have been the case. Every so gently, Campion touches upon this first through Brown's seemingly unfounded jealousy of Fanny. During one scene, Brown maintains that he has failed Keats and goes on to say that he was never aware of how much Keats had wrapped himself around his heart. However, Campion is adept at subtlety, perhaps unlike any other filmmaker. The gentleness with which she tells this story does not provide any obvious explanation for a man to be so vehemently opposed to a friend's love for a woman. It is also easy to be entranced by the romance in this film and get swept into the love between Fanny and Keats so as not to see the subplot clearly. Brown's love for Keats is an interesting aspect of the story - but there is no direct and actual evidence of a triangle. But if you watch closely, it may become more obvious than could be realized.",Bright Star
55,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Bright Star (2009),6,19 February 2020,"""Bright Star"" (2009) is a romantic movie based on the relationship of a poet and an upper-class woman. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie doesn't bother itself with moving very fast. It can feel a bit confusing at first as there is no clear objective or quest to embark, but after getting more used to it, this way of telling the story can provide a certain timelessness and somberness. Bright Star is a telling of life and love, as it can and did turn out.Now, as the story preoccupies on the feeling of love and falling in love, certain moments can have a certain ""head over heels""-feel, in that the main characters are just enjoying life and each other and gradually dismiss other things we have come to identify them with. This doesn't provide plenty of dynamic either, although there is still a satisfactory amount thanks to the character Mr. Brown.Nevertheless, Bright Star succeeds wildly in other aspects. The costumes are rich and tasteful, the acting feels genuine and the dialogue is indeed very poetic - almost too poetic at times, but never irritably. All in all, Bright Star is a poetic and romantic movie quite incapsulated in its own, cute sphere.My personal grade: a relaxing 6/10.

57,brimon28,Prettiest film of the year?,8,6 December 2009,"Another brave piece from Jane Campion. It seems to be a chick-flick, but the introductory shots with the analogues of penetration and emasculation point to another study of a strong woman who turns flirtation into power, and as we know now, profit. Campion sticks to the biographies we know: a flighty youngster who keeps her man on a string until he dies. We know that in real life Fanny Brawne did marry (a much younger man than she, indeed), and had three children. Keats's love letters were preserved until they could be converted into money. They finished up worth more than his poetry.Poetry? I think not. Keats used an idiom already dead. Those facile rhymes, the apostrophes which might have meant something in Shakespeare's day. Those of us brought up on Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Les Murray now wince at Keats's nonsense.But is the movie any good? So many people left the cinema early that I wondered if it was boredom or weak bladders. It is far too long, with some scenes unnecessarily prolonged. The movie is good after all. My wife didn't think so; it was just another 'girlie' film. But this feminist could see a dramatic rendition of the exercise of feminine power. Fanny was always in control, even in the self-harm episode.The acting was as good as it gets for this kind of film. Charming compositions made the lengthy visuals bearable. Campion has a sure hand in her direction, and her writing sticks to the biogs. There are one or two clumsy cuts; I wonder if the cat had anything to do with it. Ask your female companions how many dresses Fanny has. And what gorgeous hats! No, not just a chick-flick. This is Campion at her best.",Bright Star

59,marspeach,Beautiful and Understated,9,27 April 2011,"I loved, loved, LOVED this movie! Similar to The Young Victoria, don't expect anything like a biopic on Keats. Though it's mostly historically accurate, as far as I know, it's a romance above all else. And it is done very well. The whole movie has a very quiet feel- beautiful cinematography that uses a lot of natural light (it reminds me a lot of the 1995 Persuasion in its realistic look), exquisite costumes, and brilliant acting. Even the music, while beautiful, is quiet. There are sensual undertones throughout, but the romance, like the movie itself, is very restrained. The heroine is usually ""chaperoned"" by her younger siblings (her sister, Toots, is beyond adorable!), and the pair cannot marry due to poverty and then Keats' illness. Keats' friend and roommate, the greasy Mr. Brown, also tries to prevent their romance, but this really seems to only encourage them! The ending is tragic (Keats died of consumption at age 25) but the movie is just gorgeous.The movie is worth watching for the cinematography alone. Everything is understated and subtle, and yet left a bigger impression on me than anything on a grander scale ever has.By far my favorite thing about this movie was the costumes! It's set in the Regency, which is always a plus (for me at least. I love the fashions from that period). The heroine, Fanny, is a seamstress and prides herself on her fashionable clothes, which she makes all herself. I loved that the clothes in this actually looked hand-stitched. Fanny's gowns in the beginning can be a bit over-the-top (bright colors, big hats and collars) but become more subdued throughout the course of the film. Most of her shoes are really cute too, take notice! Some of Toots' dresses use the same fabrics as Fanny's, which I thought was a nice touch.This movie is not for everyone. If you like a lot of action and that sort of thing, you'll probably hate it. I may get slightly upset if I hear that anyone hates the costumes, though!",Bright Star

Jane Champion shows how film can tell a story without interference and how the elements of film can join together to open a world of wonder and song.The film is visual and very moving without being maudlin or melodramatic.

62,cl777,Disappointed and bored although the film is beautiful,6,20 January 2010,"Bright Star, written and directed by Jane Campion, was unfortunately a bit of a let down for me. I was expecting a slow moving, historical movie about an English poet and his untimely death but I hoped that the story would be more riveting, more moving. I thought The Piano by Campion was a much stronger film and am a bit disappointed by her latest drama.The film is based on the romance between 19th century poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne, which was cut short by Keats' death from tuberculosis at age 25. Abbie Cornish is excellent as Fanny, making us feel her profound love and terrible ensuing sadness which know no bounds. Ben Whishaw, a relatively unknown actor, is also superb, perfectly embodying the physically frail, emotionally fragile, wondrous poet that was John Keats.There is much witty humor between Fanny and John's friend and fellow poet, Charles Brown, another excellent portrayal. He derides her constantly, making fun of her penchant for fashion and sewing and of her feigned interest (according to him) in poetry. He considers her a flirt and nothing more and tries to keep her as far away from John as possible, telling her they need time for their ""musing"" and must not be disturbed. To which she replies ""Is that what us common people call thinking?"".Their love story is tragic- Fanny and John cannot marry because John does not have any income but they fall madly in love nonetheless. Fanny is his life, his inspiration and his hope during his illness. It is very sad that Keats dies almost unrecognized, poor and indebted, knowing that he then went on to become one of the most beloved and celebrated of Romantic poets.Fanny lives with her family at home and since it is impossible for her to get more involved with John I found it hard to grasp the depth of their passion to the extent that Campion wants us to feel it. The first love they are exploring is beautiful and pure, but also immature at times.There are undeniably beautiful excerpts in the exchanges between Fanny and John, such as this one, my favorite: ""I almost wish we were butterflies, and lived but three summer days. Three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain."" Fanny goes on to collect live butterflies in her room, which flutter about but end up littering the floor with their dead corpses, perhaps a symbol of this impossible love. Or ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Its loveliness increases. It will never pass into nothingness."" During the ending credits, ""Ode to a Nightingale"" is read and makes one watch them till the very last one scrolls by.The costumes are lovely; the film is definitely beautiful, well directed and wonderfully acted. However, how to put this in the most mild, most polite, English way possible: Fabio and I were both, at times, slightly, just a little bit, only a touch, bored and were expecting a teeny, weeny bit more.My rating: 6 Fabio's: 6 Total score: 12 For more reviews please visit and become a follower at: http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com",Bright Star

Everything about the film was beautiful- the language, the scenery, the words. The film tells the story of the brief romance shared between poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne. Director Jane Campion captures the purity and innocence of a young, forbidden love with both elegance and grace. Abbie Cornish truly shines in her role as the independent, strong-willed Fanny Brawne and Ben Whishaw as the great and free-spirited John Keats was phenomenal. They had such beautiful chemistry together and truly made the film something to be treasured. More than all else, the film was about first love and how that feeling can burn so strongly within a person, and how it inspired one man to write the greatest poetry of all time. Keats was truly talented and had such a mastery over the written word, a fact which is made so evident throughout the entirety of the film. She was his ""bright star""- his inspiration in both life and love. It is most difficult to choose a favorite scene but if I had to it would be the scene right before the end where Keats and Brawne share an intimate yet heartbreaking good-bye. Keats knows that he is dying and will probably never see Fanny again, and deep down she knows it too, despite her unwillingness to accept it. But he just holds her in his arms and recites another one of his poems that he's written for her, describing the moment so perfectly. As a writer I had such an appreciation for this film- truly inspiring. ""Bright Star"" is truly one of a kind- a must see!",Bright Star
64,Edd-N-Furter,A feast for the eyes and the senses,10,6 April 2010,"Jane Campion's latest film Bright Star introduces us in a very particular way to one of the most inspiring romances but also one of the least known by people around the world: young poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne.Keats and Brawne first met in 1818, he already was a published poet (although his work wasn't very acclaimed at that time) and she was a fashion student. Intrigued about poetry and Keats himself, Fanny asks him to teach her poetry. What happens next is somehow expected: they fall in love, but his economic situation, Charles Brown's disapproval of Fanny (Keats was Brown's protegeé and his best friend) and a fatal disease seem to doom the romance.All these elements could have been used in a cheap and over-dramatic biopic about Keats. Instead Campion takes as inspiration the letters he wrote to Fanny, avoids all the clichés of star-crossed lovers movies and gives us a stunning meditation about love and words as an instrument to keep two people together in spite of time and distance. Campion also achieves what many other people fail when it comes to create period pieces: through an elegant and subtle direction makes the romance totally believable even when some people might find it anachronic and cold.Campion's movies are always a visual delight and this movie is not the exception. This time Campion appeals to the visual element to immerse the audience into the atmosphere of Keats and Brawne's world in a sensorial experience. This is where Greg Frasier's extraordinary cinematography or Jannet Patterson's ravishing art direction become as important as Keats' poetry. The Oscar nominated costume design deserves a special mention, for being the most important of all technical elements since without it, Fanny's world and vision wouldn't be the same.The soul of the movie, however, lies in the acting. Paul Schneider as Brown creates an equally repulsive/fascinating character that plays ambigously with the idea that he was jealous of Fanny man. Ben Whishaw gives Keats a new life and makes us wonder if the real Keats was as charming and attractive. And Abbie Cornish in a brilliant performance embodies the soul of a strong but delicate and sensitive woman named Fanny Brawne who happened to be John Keats' bright star.This movie is a perfect opportunity to know John Keats' poetry for those who still don't know him and also it's an experience for those who enjoy a great story.",Bright Star

69,klc-16,Bright Star pretty dim,4,1 February 2010,"Oh dear... Ms Campion is really overdoing it this time. At least The Piano Player had nudity and Harvey Keitel to keep us awake.This is a chick-flick at its very worst. Long, tedious to the point of somnolence, she has made all the wrong moves here. First, she chooses Australian actress Abbie Cornish to play the heroine, Fanny Brawne, who perhaps might be good in something else, but here just has NO charisma. Her seven year old sister in the film is more vibrant and interesting to watch than she is. Second, there is not a single person in the film who you would like to actually know: Keats mopes around with a smarmy smile; his Scottish friend and mentor, Charles Armitage Brown(Paul Schneider) is the closest we see to anyone with a little REAL passion or life to him - unfortunately all he gets to do is be difficult, jealous and obnoxious from beginning to end. The girl's family flicker around the edges, never ever really coming to life... Everyone seems to be playing on ONE note... and the rhythm of the film never changes either. Both these defects most likely can be attributed to Campion, who we expect should know better. Utterly dreadful !I have adored Ben Whishaw ever since seeing him in Perfume : The History of a Murderer. Well, either Whishaw has suddenly lost all his talent, or Ms Campion just doesn't know how to breathe life into this enterprise, but he has never seemed LESS interesting. And there is just NO electricity between his Keats and Miss Browne. They go through the motions, but I just don't believe they are really hot for each other.Of course, all the feminists and their boyfriends – nicely trained in Political Correctness – will ADORE this film for concentrating on women's feelings instead of action. In today's society everything is supposed to follow a polite formula and NOT be messy. But I think it is time Ms Campion tried her hand at making a film from the MAN'S point of view for a change. She is stuck in a rut and obviously is the worse for wear. Nevertheless I will give her points for the visuals and the attention to detail. The shot where the women leave their Hampstead house, passing through a muddy yard with bedsheets hung out to dry and London's St Paul's in the distance was perfect; it gave us a sense of time, place and circumstances, and I was delighted with it. The clothes really did often look hand-made - and often not very flattering, exactly what a woman of the heroine's ilk and social class might be expected to make/wear. (Imagine how sumptuous the clothes would have looked if this had been a Merchant/Ivory film.!) I also give Ms Campion kudos for having managed to find a bevy of actresses whose faces really DO resemble the women who we see in portraits of the period as opposed to the beauties of our own era. They all look just a little less attractive than we might have hoped; this give them a veracity of period which someone like Julie Roberts just doesn't somehow manage to bring off in quite the same way. I was SO looking forward to this film, principally for Ben Whishaw and buoyed by having re-watched The Piano a few weeks previous to seeing Bright Star. The Piano, though also slow-moving and the ultimate chick-flick, DID manage to have characters who were deep, fascinating, intriguing and believable. Bright Star somehow manages to diminish everyone in it. Ladies, I know I won't be able to persuade you to avoid this - Ms Campion is too well-loved for that. But be kind: leave your boyfriends and husbands at home!",Bright Star

Paul Schneider also was perfect and carried off what, to me, was a very convincing Scottish accent. I also thought the setting perfect and what I loved was the authenticity of the representation of an era that had no rural street lighting, no properly paved roads and gardens that were turned over to produce.

It's amazing how a director as talented as Campion can illustrate the emotion and inner-recesses of the heart. Campion did an excellent job bringing that out on the screen. Period movies and love stories should be more like this. 10 out of 10.",Bright Star
72,timberck,Poorly constructed script with good performances,2,7 November 2009,"This is a classic case of ""The Emperors New Clothes"" - the hype makes everyone think it should be good, but if you look closely, there's not much there. The cast has the unenviable task of fighting a very poorly constructed script, and they do an enviable job. The performances, however, are one of the few things going for this film.The script feels like a first draft, and comes off like a checklist of Keat's life. There is no dramatic arc. A good script will have elements established early on that pay off later in the script, but this has none of that. Anything that is introduced is dealt with immediately, and then you move on to the next item, so there is no sense of structure, dramatic tension or story arc. It literally feels like a checklist. The dialogue alternates between clumsy and awful, and the reading of the poetry always seems artificial and overwrought. I also wonder if a lot of footage ended up on the cutting room floor, as there are huge leaps in logic and there is little emotional continuity. There is no sense of the character's relationships to each other and I did not believe that there was any spark of true love between the two main protagonists! The film kept trying to tell you they were in love, but it just wasn't actually there (despite strong performances).The costumes and sets are wonderful, but the camera work and lighting is dodgy. The film has numerous soft shots and strange use of hand-held, where the camera seems to accidentally move and bump with no sense of intent. The framing is often downright awkward and strange, and aside from a number of scattered ""beauty shots"", the cinematography is pretty poor.This was quite a disappointing film, despite the hype. I feel like I am the little girl in Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Emporers New Clothes"" who says, ""But, he's not wearing anything!""",Bright Star
73,BKTrayner,Too Slow For Comfort,3,5 October 2009,"It is a beautiful costume drama set in Victorian England. There are no preposterous car chases. Nobody morphs into an alien. It is not a cartoon supposedly for children that contains all sorts of off-color jokes to train the next generation of off-color individuals.And, yes, this is one of those romances where they are able to create tremendous sexual tension while everybody keeps their clothes on.BUT. This movie is simply slow, and your mind wanders ""lonely as a cloud"" watching it. Compared to ""Sense and Sensibility,"" for instance, it is missing any interesting/quirky/humorous secondary characters that make you chuckle or saying ""Right on."" By reducing the story to the minimal number of characters and telling you the minimal amount about each one of them, there simply isn't enough going on.Just because we like to see dramas set in Victorian times with great costumes, etc., doesn't mean we don't want to become engrossed in the movie and to forget about all the stuff going on in the real world. A good movie should have a compelling plot that keeps you interested. Maybe this would be a great movie if you cut out 30 minutes of it.",Bright Star
74,diuscorvus,"wonderful, if flawed",8,1 February 2011,"I've only seen one other Campion film, ""The Piano."" Frankly I was surprised by how different ""Bright Star"" is. And yet, the two films have much in common. The focal character is a woman, who has a younger doppelganger - Ada's daughter in ""The Piano"" and Fanny's younger sister in ""Bright Star."" The overspilling of erotic feelings of the older woman onto the young girl, who has become a surrogate for the male, which occurred so disturbingly and brilliantly in ""The Piano,"" is, in fact, repeated in ""Bright Star."" Moreover, there's even a two-men-one-woman love triangle, this being Keats-Fanny-Charles in ""Bright Star."" The differences between the two films are nevertheless very great, to say the least. ""The Piano"" seems much more - wild, I suppose. That film takes place on an alien island. ""Bright Star,"" though it features stretches of wilderness and moors, takes place in the English countryside; people (Fanny's brother and sister) are never out of the frame or far out of it. The love triangle in ""The Piano"" culminates in - well, something quite violent. Nothing of the sort in ""Bright Star."" The immortal image of ""The Piano"" is the sea - grey, vast, rolling in inexorably, dwarfing its people. Whereas the immortal image of ""Bright Star"" is - what? This is the most interesting of Campion's inventions, and also the part in which, I think, she falters. ""Bright Star"" is about human art (as opposed to the beautiful loveliness of the sea in ""The Piano""). The opening titles feature human voices singing Mozart, a segment that is reprised later in the film; Fanny and Keats are both artists in their own way (fashion, poetry); at the end of the film, Fanny responds to the devastation of Keats's death by creating and wearing a mourning dress and reciting Keats's ""Bright Star"" poem. It is with these human creations - the making of a dress, the repetition of human words - that she overcomes the awful grief that, in the previous scene, had rendered her unable to breathe.Unfortunately, I don't think Campion captures human art as well as she did brute nature in ""The Piano."" First of all - her approach to poetry. She makes it seem that Keats sat around all day until inspiration hit, which I guarantee is *not* true - poets hone their craft, make lots of drafts, consider theories, read other poets, read criticisms, etc., etc. Secondly, troublingly, Fanny's passion for Keats seems almost like a negative force. Under its influence, she's sometimes unable to eat, and she's unable to respond to it with creative output - as does Keats via his famous letters. In fact, Fanny seems most her own when she's courting Keats, acting as a ""flirt"" and creating those startling, stunning dresses.On the other hand, Campion rightly shows that Keats draws his power not only from Fanny's rarefied world of beautiful English countryside, but also from the deep squalor of London. Keats wrote from his brother's death and his poverty - but out of that, he could write about beauty, immortality, and truth. Ultimately, Campion's film does not examine how Keats was able to do so - and its suggestions in that matter are somewhat disappointing. But Campion's film is about Fanny, is complemented by Keats's poetry, and considers human response to its natural ungovernable passions and inevitable mortality.""Bright Star"" has its weak spots, but it has marvelous moments, well up to par with ""The Piano."" The treatment of Charles's feelings for Fanny, which is brought up numerously in jest in the first half of the film, is illuminated in a simple shot of Charles looking out the window at Fanny. It's all clear in that one moment - although no words are said, and it's not at all clear just what he feels for her, or what he knows (or thinks) he feels. And the last, ravishing sequence in which Fanny recites the poem while walking through the forest - I can only think of Wong Kar-Wai's delicate shot of Maggie Cheung in ""Ashes of Time"" that has a similar splendour.",Bright Star
75,webber-george,Overall a fairy good film,7,31 August 2015,"I just recently watched this film for the first time and was impressed but the film, it was pretty good. The acting was faultless and I must say there was a stand out performance by Abby Cornish. The cinematography was equally of a high standard, there are several scenes where the lighting and atmosphere really help you feel part of the story. I also should give kudos to the costume department, their choices were perfect. Looking at the film itself I should say its a very well told romantic tale the story between Fanny and Keats could so easily have become a more sentimental one. But through a natural dialogue between characters a little bit of humour and good control over the story line Campion has managed to make a really good film. You can feel the emotions coming across and take the emotional journey with the characters throughout. Its just a really nice film.",Bright Star
76,smithr1223,Stunned by this film,9,5 June 2012,"I was literally stunned by this film, Campion has crafted another masterwork, and I found myself intensely relieved that I saw it in the comfort of my home rather than in a theatre. As breathtaking as I imagine it would be on the big screen I am sure I would have been removed from the theatre sobbing uncontrollably. At home I even had to pause the film several times because I just needed a break from it, yet I'd go back to it quickly, I was entirely pulled in to the story. Abbie Cornish is a revelation, I'd just seen her in Limitless, unrecognizable as the same actress. The costumes are so memorable I immediately began sketching one of her jackets to replicate (and I've never done that before from watching a period film). The art direction was haunting - like perfect still-life paintings. Fanny's little sister Toots, played by Edie Martin, delighted me every time she appeared on screen. The poetry itself, and how seriously it was taken by the characters, took me back to a seemingly simpler time and I immediately began pulling out long forgotten poetry volumes (my garden hasn't looked the same to me since seeing Bright Star).Bright Star is a must-see.",Bright Star
77,brownsugarforyou,Beautiful cinematography,8,26 September 2009,"The material was handled differently than I would have by the director. Not much happens in this movie, yet it's the small mundane day to day events that touch the viewer and are the strongest aspect of the film. For example the relationship between Toots and Fanny is very sweet. Her brother Samuel also struck me simply because in the clothes of that period he embodied that in-between awkward stage between a child and a man. His clothes hung awkwardly on him but this makes him more endearing to the viewer. The main actress Fanny (Abbie Cornish) has a striking resemblance to Katie Holmes, especially her expressions. At moments the period piece seemed jarringly modern. Especially when Fanny sits with her legs crossed, or the shots where her hair is loose from her bun while she is at home. This is a historical piece however Fanny's character seems far too out-spoken than the real Fanny would have been, I doubt in that age and time she would have the personality portrayed. As for the costume design for some scenes the clothing could have been Prada. For instance there is one shot where Fanny is sitting in a chair and we see her sheer brown blouse with the black shirt over it, and this looks modern til in a later scene we see that the shirt is actually a long shirt and the blouse has ribbons at the cuffs. The hat's also are too sheer and structured and modern to be the era this movie is set in. The clothing was beautiful and flawless however the style's sensibility seemed a bit too modern almost. Having gone through English Literature courses, I had a passing acquaintance with Keat's works. However to be completely honest I did share some of the opinions of the reviewers of his time, some of the lines of poetry offered in this film wasn't that great. However it does seem that every poet has one or two poems that they are ""famous"" for and the rest of their work may be mediocre or forgotten however they still get praise and admiration. Also if you spend all day, every day writing poetry you are bound to come up with something good despite yourself. He was 25 when he passed away sadly and perhaps with age his poetry would have improved. Also at 25 what you think love is actually is often infatuation, and is vastly different from when you are 50 or even 75. I think he was sentimental but I doubt it was true love between Fanny and Keats. With the harsh realities of poverty, I didn't quite understand why Keats chose to give up medicine and be a poverty-stricken poet... could he not have done both? The other part of the story that didn't make sense was the character of Fanny's mom. At only one point did she express concerns about Fanny's relationship with Keats, overall she was supportive. I think more could have been done with her character. An odd fact not mentioned in this film is that Keat's had a sister also named Fanny who was alive (or maybe it was mentioned in the film yet I missed it) and after his death both Fanny's became friends. There is no wikipedia entry for Fanny Brawne at the moment, somehow it seemed odd that she would not move on with her life after Keats death. In that time period illness and death were a part of life, her father had passed away as well. I don't know why the director focused on their having a platonic relationship, as Fanny was apparently promiscuous. Also Charles Brown seemed too jealous of Fanny spending time with Keats, and Brown stated that he loved Keats, was there something more than platonic friendship between the two? Having written this long, meandering review I do have to admit that I enjoyed this movie. I love period pieces and this movie does bring a freshness to the genre. And yes, the love scenes did bring tears to my eyes. I liked the title Bright Star. An unusual love story, involving real people who have long passed and taken the true secrets of their relationship to the grave. For those of you planning a vacation to the UK, Keats House is now a museum in Hampstead, North London and artifacts include a lock of fanny's hair as well as the engagement ring Keats gave to her.",Bright Star

I guess this film will be marketed to women and literary types, the latter of whom would go see anything about a person like John Keats. It is slllllloooooowwwwww. It takes aaaagggggeeeessss to go anywhere, at all. it is really a piece of art about nothing, the material is really quite 'thin' .... so there are many beautifully framed scenes which mean nothing - often with no dialogue.

79,trypanophobic34,A thing of beauty is a joy forever,9,19 September 2009,"I just had the pleasure of seeing Bright Star tonight. I was hoping it would be as good as the trailer, and it was. The trailer is not misleading in this sense but a pretty good representation of the movie.Most of the negative reviews I've read for this have something to do with how the film is ""little"" or ""slow."" Rarely, they comment that it's ""melodramatic."" Which it's NOT by any means. It is not mawkishly sentimental at all. It's not epic, it is small in a way, and there's never any seizing moment of action. That doesn't make it boring; it's engaging throughout. This is different from any period film I've ever seen, or really, imagined. It's not like typical period pieces in trying to wow you with its aesthetic recreation of the time, it's not so much about the visual splendor, though it looks very lovely and is thoroughly convincing as a representation of that period. It's visually quite different from other period pieces, it has a more realistic and kind of earthy look rather than pastel-colored and with a glow around everything. There are slums and less-than-palatial places. This isn't Pride and Prejudice. Neither does it have sort of a broad, sweeping narrative. At heart it's a deep love story about famed poet John Keats and his love and muse, Franny Brawne, whose relationship was cut short by a tragic death. It delves deeply into the small details of their courtship, and is pretty involved psychologically.These people are portrayed realistically. Even the more minor characters, they all seem to be real people, with actual personalities, rather than caricatures or types of stuffy Regency people who are preoccupied with propriety and good marriage matches. Fanny's mother is nice, the main issue with her marrying Keats is that he literally can't support her, and the people they know aren't mindlessly concerned about it. They actually have FUN and do more interesting things than stand at ballroom dances and sit at dinner. Who would have thought people in a Regency period movie could actually climb trees, walk in the mud, or do quirky, whimsical things? Their ease and naturalness and relative candor in moving around, interacting with, and talking to each other was refreshing and definitely different from the idea you generally get. And this is the first period piece I've ever, ever seen where anyone has actually picked up and held their pet cat and treated it like you would your pet. You can actually hear it purring, it's a real part of their surroundings. I liked that cat, it was cute.The dialogue was superb. It wasn't this sloppy, general, or comical/absurd stuff. It was precise, clear, charged with personality, and often beautiful. When you hear the conversations between Fanny and John, it's brilliant, real, and a pleasure. I have never seen such intelligence, subtlety, or elegance in a movie in this way. To hear Fanny respond to something John said, even just a word, as if she were actually thinking about it, as would happen in real life, as if she were an intelligent, feeling, witty person, was so nice. And so DIFFERENT. It's a little hard to explain if you haven't seen it. Suffice it to say, the dialogue is delicate and nuanced. They are articulate but not pretentious, they are sensitive, individual people - not unreal types who don't pick up on details. And it being about Keats, the characters have a lot of literary intelligence. You will enjoy the poetry in the movie.The acting was great. Keats - I would probably fall in love with him, too. He seems like such a sensitive, romantic, and intelligent guy. Ben Whishaw was perfect for him. And Abbie Cornish as Fanny is wonderful - while not extravagantly gorgeous exactly, her face has such clear features that she has an extraordinary appeal. She is a very striking character, and deeply feeling about Keats. You get a real sense of love, real responses to grief instead of just a pretty swoon. It was a real romance - their tender kiss was beautiful, the things they said to each other, and the things they felt.This movie is one of those rare films that are almost perfect to me. That doesn't make it my favorite movie, but it means I didn't find much wrong with it. The emotion isn't overwhelming, it's not exactly visceral, but it's moving and penetrating, it has its own style. It's NOT sappy or conventional. The extreme intelligence, realism, and emotional depth of this movie truly set it apart from all others. I heard a review say something like about how it's just about ""old British speech and mannerisms,"" which couldn't be farther from the truth. It is NOT driven by quaintness or generic period speech like other period films. The dialogue is not stiff, pretentious, or artificial, though it's accurate. Sweet, moving, and intelligent, Bright Star has rare depth. It's definitely like no other movie. You should go see it if you think you'd be into it at all, by any stretch. You might not like it - it is rather ""slow,"" but very interesting, at least for me - but it would be a thick or insensitive person indeed who couldn't appreciate it in some way. It's like how Keats described Fanny - ""the brightest, most delicate thing.""My favorite quotes are:""A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Its loveliness increases. It will never pass into nothingness.""""I almost wish we were butterflies, and lived but three summer days. Three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain."" There are many others, much of Keats' letters to Fanny is so beautiful, but I can't remember them off the top of my head. These are two that appear in the trailer.",Bright Star
80,learningthelingo,Come frolic in ye fields of splendor,7,11 January 2010,"There seems to be one image that the new Jane Campion film seems to be running with. And it is this image that has continually stayed in my mind since seeing the poster art, and will probably continue to persist in my mind when I think of the film. I have included this picture below, and I won' t lie when I say that it was this dark blue/possibly purple field that partly attracted me into seeing this film.The other attraction was the interesting filmmaker Jane Campion. Over the last few years, I have attempted to take in the occasional Campion film. I must say that I do find Campion's films to be quite subtle and can take some time to actually resonate in my own mind. My first viewing of a Campion film In the Cut (2003) was my must see film after the car crash disaster of an interview between British interviewer Michael Parkinson and film star Meg Ryan. That film itself, to this time has been my most enjoyable Campion film, ranking above the Oscar winning epic The Piano (1993), Campion's feature film debut Sweetie (1989) and the Henry James adaptation Portrait of a Lady (1996).Actually, to be honest my favourite Campion piece was the accompanying documentary to Portrait of a Lady which showed a very fragile Nicole Kidman, Barbara Hershey as the actor that Campion seemed to forget about, John Malkovich almost playing the John Cusack version of himself that is portrayed in Being John Malkovich (1999) and a completely crazy Shelley Winters (I'm talking Elizabeth Taylor/Liza Minnelli crazy!) This cannot be more highly recommended, and if you've seen and enjoyed the video diaries that accompany Lars von Trier's Dogville (2003), then you DEFINITELY MUST see this!!! But alas, we come to Bright Star (2009) which centers around two lovers Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), the muse to poet John Keats (Ben Whishaw) who's love affair lasted for three years, starting in 1818. Both actors bring capable and honed performances that stay true to the core of Keats poems, the times, and the theme of love itself. Cornish displays a love so intense that her agonising feelings of separation between herself and Keats is beyond palpable. And on a superficial level, Whishaw manages to successfully don a Noel Fielding hairdo (Mighty Boosh style) that appealed to my eyes throughout the film.Campion has a knack of bringing us these period pieces of Bright Star, Portrait of a Lady and The Piano that are reminiscent of the Merchant Ivory films of the early 1990s with Emma Thompson. But The Piano and Portrait of a Lady seem to have an inherent theme of sexuality and treachery (respectively) that is a little more intense than these usual Merchant Ivory films. The less thematically intense Bright Star (which is rated PG in Australia) seems to fall pray of the same enduring love theme that we have seem repeated again and again over the years in the likes of the Emma Thompson/Jane Austen/Merchant Ivory films. So why does Bright Star even need to be put forth to a cinema going audience, one might wonder? It's all about the poet and his muse.Poetry could be called fairly unrepresented on the silver screen in terms of films that are written about famous poets. We have an endless amount of films that are based on famous British authors, and an even more endless array of adaptations of these famous British authors stories. But what we seem to miss is the works of the famous English poets such as Keats, Blake, Wordsworth and Byron. These Romantic poets are mentioned in Bright Star, and it is this love of poetry that Campion shows as something beautiful in the words of Keats.""Bright star, would I were steadfast as thous"" was the poem that the title comes from, which is used so effectively to drive the films romantic and undying love themes. Campion has faithfully put Keats words to screen, with a story that manages to stay in my mind and I'm sure when I think of Keats, I shall also think of Brawne. Along with the success of Campions script and direction comes excellent cinematography from Greig Fraser, which is shown in the image included in this review. Mark Bradshaw also brings us an interested and an almost isolated soundtrack that is most highlighted by a sole violin and an a capella choir of men that brings the classical English sound to be a modern film.",Bright Star
81,brown-faith922,Exceeds Expectations,7,5 August 2013,"If you're looking for the perfect love story, or even for a really original and well-constructed movie, look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for something extremely interesting and rather smart, try this out for size. 'Bright Star' is as sappy, corny, and dramatic a love story as they come, and yet I somehow don't judge it too harshly. I found the acting believable, and even the storyline seemed somehow harshly realistic.I began this movie knowing very little about John Keats... little more than that he was a poet with a very interesting mind (as if there were any other kind). Immediately, I found Whishaw easy to believe as Keats. His initial awkward nature and occasional outbursts of mirth and folly somehow seemed just right for an ever-dreaming poet. Cornish, I will admit, annoyed me at times, but it was her character which did that. I found myself somewhat annoyed with her character's motivations and priorities, and personally saw very little in Fanny that was either admirable or likable, and yet such was the character, and I believe Cornish played it in about the only way it could have been played. Her solemnity adds a layer of interest to the character. And to be fair, she had her moments of tenderness with her siblings that allowed the audience to see her as somewhat three-dimensional.While I cannot claim to have been overly fond of any character, nor particularly taken in by any of them, I must admit that the aura of this movie captivated me completely. The lack of a soundtrack in many scenes added to the theme. The idea that words really controlled this movie and provided the background beauty, rather than only music, was a very interesting one. I did enjoy the way the movie delved into the purposes of poetry as well as its sensory nature. I actually wish the film had focused more on this than on the romance! In short, it is by no means a great film, but an interesting one. I commend the actors, I think they did a wonderful job, and I look forward to seeing Whishaw in many more demanding roles.",Bright Star
82,catjoescreed,Unexceptional,3,16 November 2009,"Campion's film was so restrained and so remote that I was unable to care much for anyone except the brother who died. And why did she put so much camera focus on the children, while giving them nothing to do, nothing to say, and no real vital presence in the story line? There's Thomas Sangster, all grown up, justifiably famous, skilled as an actor, and so underutilized he might have been drapery.*sigh*I've been reading generalized complaints on the discussion board that men tend not to like movies like this, and that their harsh ratings will cause the overall score to go down, whilst women apparently unilaterally love this film. So, a disclaimer: I am female. I'm not overly keen on ""action/adventure"" films or cheap smack-down comedies. I like intelligent movies, and I don't mind slow-moving ones. Campion's ""The Piano"" was excellent. No, it was not the pace of ""Bright Star"" that I objected to, but its lack of emotional involvement, its weirdly inattentive hyper-attention to period detail (Fanny's hair for example), and its elision of what surely must have been important plot elements. In all, I found Fanny's sparring with Mr. Browne far more interesting than her mooning over Mr. Keats.Pretty to look at, this film, but not worth paying attention to.",Bright Star
83,vmariposa,This film is a masterpiece.,10,5 October 2009,"Each scene, every word uttered by the characters was so beautifully and often wittily crafted that I couldn't help but wish I lived in such a lush world, full of idealism and love of literature, not to mention people who cared about one another with such kindness and unabashed concern. Many of the scenes evoked the sixteenth century Dutch masters, whom Jane Campion may have used to set an authentic tone for her masterpiece. John Keats, the most intensely romantic of the Romantic poets (although Shelley and Lord Byron did their best) could not have received a fairer treatment, plus he was superbly acted by Ben Whislaw; I fell in love with the entire cast. This film lives up to its potential, and if you know anything about the life of Keats, you realize that it is a Titanic sort of plot, because the ship must go down. Yet my sadness was only that I have to live in the current world so dominated by name brands and nonsense rather than the fine stitchery and wit of Fanny Brawne.

84,skydiveroffreefalls,Bright Star is not a magical romantic experience as period dramas should be,5,30 June 2010,"So I kept hearing so much about The Piano all these years. You probably have heard of it, even if you haven't seen it. Critically acclaimed, Oscar-winner and all that. And I thought it was time I should watch this popular Jane Campion film. Since I was going to watch it, I took the chance to watch Bright Star before. It was directed by Campion as well, rated at 7.2 on IMDb, a period drama starring Ben Whishaw and Abby Cornish. How could they go wrong? Beautiful leads, romantic setting and me- someone belonging exactly to the targeted audience: romantic female with a weakness for period films. My favorite movies include Pride and Prejudice and I have written articles about the period movies to watch.But watching to movie, I failed to be intrigued by any character or line. In fact, I hated Mr. Brown and Paul Schnedier's interpretation of him. The scenes are mostly too long, boring and/or mundane. This is not how an engaging drama should work. The movie did not have one fun moment in its body. And what on earth did they get the talented Thomas Sangster for? His character barely spoke and added nothing to the story. That boy is talented and he is often seen in fun roles- that have lines and action. Remember the kid in Love Actually? And Ceasar in The Last Legion? I am a little concerned about watching The Piano now. While I love Harvey Keitel, and the premise sounds very interesting, I am not sure if it will be a worthwhile experience. But of course I will watch it anyway. The plot? Oh that: England, 19th century. Young and beautiful Fanny Brawne (Abby Cornish)is fascinated by fashion and clothing and designs and makes all her clothes. Young poet John Keates is striving to make money with his work and is often working with Mr. Brown. As much as Mr. Brown and Fanny hate each other, a romance eventually blossoms between Fanny and Keats. The fact that he can't support himself , that he is mostly dependent on Brown as a writing mate and more, complicate things. Love would probably conquer all but then Keats falls terminally ill Yes, Keats is a real poet that lived in that period. And his real life couldn't have been this boring, could it? Yes, there are many who enjoyed this film, hence the 7.2 rating but I am just not one of them. 4-5/10.More Movie Reviews: http://pinartarhan.com/blog/",Bright Star
85,delilah55,A brighter word than Bright,10,23 September 2009,"I saw this film tonight, and in my eyes, it is a perfect film. Beautifully acted by all involved, (several times during the film I found myself thinking 'Abby Cornish is amazing!"", despite not being a huge fan before), and stunningly shot, it contains some of the most beautifully cinematic scenes i have ever seen committed to film. Campion does a wonderful job of communicating Fanny' emotional state through the composition, particularly in one scene where the wind is blowing the curtain in her bedroom. The light and colour are fresh and gorgeous and the costumes and design add to the overall piece without being distracting, which is just what you want from a period piece.But in the end, it is above all a wonderful story, well told. A deeply romantic tale, the story of Fanny and Keats could easily have become a mawkish, overly sentimental piece. But through her wonderfully naturalistic dialogue, her use of humour and light touch, and her restrained story telling (she never lets a scene go on one line too long) Jane Campion has created a heart wrenching film which I cannot fault. The characters are real and fully rounded, you feel the joys and the pain with them, and where I think she really succeeds is by making their love affair extraordinary and yet at the same time deeply ordinary. It stirred up my own personal experiences of love and loss and you would have to have a heart of stone not to shed a tear at the end. Lovely lovely film, and what cinema should be all about.",Bright Star
86,Hunting_Wild,"""Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty""",10,4 October 2009,"Bright Star marks Jane Campion's return to form with a period film that is delicately beautiful, poetic, haunting and a tribute to the tragic love affair between the poet John Keats and the girl who lived next door, Fanny Brawne.The film is set in Regency period England and compresses the 3 last years of Keats life when he fell in love and produced some of his most memorable poetic works, such as Ode to a Nightingale and Bright Star, a poem inspired by his Fanny Brawne.The film begins when after returning from a walking tour of Scotland with his poet/playwright friend Charles Brown, Keats is invited to share Brown's half of a summer rental house with him in Hampstead, a town outside London. It is there where Keats meets Fanny Brawne and her family who eventually rent out the other half of the house.Fanny as played by Abbie Cornish is a stylish, witty and strong willed girl who finds herself drawn to the poet, and to poetry. The romance that blossoms between the two is visualized in the most tender and moving ways. The use of natural light, nature and sparse Baroque-like music evoke the purity of first love. Like a Keats' poem, the film is a feast for the senses: A gentle breeze catches a window curtain and moves in waves over Fanny's dress as she is lying on her bed. A web of tree branches dance in the breeze above a field of wild blue flowers, as she reads the letter from her love.As well, much of Keats poetry is read by the actors, but the words come out of their mouths naturally.The film will not appeal to everyone, as it is a languid, slow pace film, but the emotional pay off at the end of the film is worth it. Abbie Cornish is luminescent in her performance, and Whishaw manages to show Keats wittiness, seriousness and big heart.Lastly, although the affair between Keats and Fanny is restrained and chaste, the acting is full of vitality and life. Small details of the everyday shine through, the clothes look lived in, and although the beauty of the film is precious and delicate, the film feels natural, modern and yet of another world at the same time.After watching Bright Star, like after reading a good poem, I felt tender and pure inside, or in Keats words, like I had arrived ""at that trembling delicate and snail-horn perception of beauty"".",Bright Star
87,ghazalehf13,a romance with GOLDEN PALM,10,20 September 2009,"I think Golden palm on romance movies should be a brilliant thing...I haven't believe it yet but as soon as i see the movie I will believe. yes...you got it right I'm commenting on this movie & i haven't seen it........this is ridiculousAs i've heard:Ben Whishaw was brilliant as the frail, emaciated Keats, racked with the tuberculosis that killed his brother and would soon take his own life. One thing I did think whilst watching and that was that we never really saw Keats working away, burning the midnight oil, scratching out his poems, of which he wrote many in a short space of time during the latter part of his short life. We did however see much of his inspiration for his work and of course the title of the film is a poem said to be about the relationship of the night sky to his beloved Fanny.The photography was brilliant, much use of natural light and we follow the love story from it's awkward start to it's passionate, bitter and sad end. We see Keats friends rallying after the onset of his illness and they decide to send him off to Italy where it is hoped the air might prolong his frail life. Fanny has to endure much of this in silence since she is not properly engaged to Keats and has no real say in his ultimate departure to Italy and is unable to support herself or accompany him.The relationship is played out very authentically with none of your Mills and Boon clinches or bed scenes. The most we see is a genuine cuddle in front of the fire or the odd tentative kiss. This makes the pairing seem all the more deep and inferred. The climax must be when Fanny finds out the news from Brown that Keats has died in Italy. The take is unusually long but really hits home and even I found myself wiping away the odd tear as Fanny struggled for breath on the stairs.A beautiful film documenting a little know relationship. We also see how Keats died almost a pauper and yet went on to become probably the best loved and celebrated of English Poets, up there with Byron and Wordsworth. Yes the costumes were faultless but this film belongs to the talents of Cornish and Whishaw as well as the masterful direction of Jane Campion.can't wait too see it......ghazaleh",Bright Star

He is one of the finest and most celebrated of the romantic poets from the beginning of the 19th century, and besides the fact that he wrote he wrote brilliant poetry, his personal biography personifies most of the important features of the romantic age: The poor poet who devotes his life to art, but is not appreciated by the critics or the public until after his death. A passionate love affair that cannot lead to marriage, because he is unable to support a family. Finally his death at a young age (25) of tuberculosis - the ""romantic disease"".The film takes place over a period of three years. The main theme of the film is the passionate love story between John Keats and Fanny Brawne. When they first meet Keats is 22 and Fanny is 17. Keats has moved into in a cottage near the Brawn family with his mentor and friend Mr. Brown. Their love develops slowly, because Keats is painfully aware that he is not a suitable match for a young girl of a respectable middle class family, and so is Fanny's mother. Fanny is a cheerful girl who likes to dance and sew fine dresses, and Keat's poetry does not immediately appeal to her. Keats moves back and forth from the cottage and Fanny, but being apart only makes their feelings stronger. They write passionate love letters to each other, and when they meet again, they cannot hide their feelings, and decide to get engaged. Shortly afterwards Keats falls ill with tuberculosis, and is advised to move to the warmer climate of Italy. Keats dies a few months later in Rome.Jane Campion is an excellent film director and besides ""The Piano"" from 1993, ""Bright Star"" is her best film so far. Her biggest achievement is the visual beauty, and the dreamlike quality of the film which matches Keats' poetry perfectly, but it is also a very modern film with people of flesh and blood, who share passionate kisses and warm embraces.",Bright Star

Fanny's first and last love was a true poet's soul and she reacted on that with painful tears. This movie made me cry as well. But the life of a poet was far more rich with adventures, inspirations and of course love! The movie completely made me wish to have the same love story and to fall in love with a poet.The acting is natural and good. I loved this movie because of the beauty and harmony it brought to me. Every scene was full of professionalism and was done with deep humanly feeling. Every frame felt like painting worth sitting in. most of the scenes were decided Sensitively and gracefully.this makes the movie worth watching.The director knew what young love is,moreover how a poet can love and she did not hesitate to put that magic on the screen. The music was also charming. Mozart made the atmosphere light and airy. My favorite scene involves Fanny with the butterflies. As those creatures resemble freedom and carelessness, so was the couple's love. Bright Star - the title of the movie means hope. Fanny Brown has been the only hope for John Keats in his last years of life.

90,skin3000,Heart breaking love story,8,24 June 2010,"Bright Star is a heart breaking love story set in London 1818. It tells the tale of the famous poet John Keats who becomes entangled in the life of the rather eccentric Fanny Brawne, the young lady living next door.Fanny an outspoken educated student of fashion becomes intrigued by the young Keats and tries to appreciate his writings and asks him to teach her the fine art of understanding poetry. Much to the utter irritation of Keats friend mister Brown whom Keats is sponsored by and living with.The chemistry between the two is light and subtle to begin with and you not too sure in the beginning if the two are falling in love or if they are to become sworn enemies (well this is my take on it in any case). I think this is what makes the movie so moving is that there is a slow gradual build in their love affair right from the beginning through to the dramatic end. In enjoyed the interesting outfits that Fanny Brawne wore, one can definitely feel that she was some what of a vivacious woman for her times. If one can appreciate period drama's then you should love this one. It gives one a bit of everything that's expected from a movie as such. As a side note, my heart almost breaks while the credits roll, the actor who played the young Keats (Ben Whishaw) reads out ""Ode to a Nightingale"". Is it just so beautiful, I leave you with the first verse if I may :MY heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot, But being too happy in thine happiness,- That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees, In some melodious plot Of beechen green, and shadows numberless, Singest of summer in full-throated ease.",Bright Star
91,joan-544-14593,"The Poet of Film, Fails",4,2 October 2009,"The Poet of Film, Fails Jane Campion has endeared herself to art film lovers with breakthrough films, gorgeous cinematography and inspired imagery. Who can ever forget a tangled Holly Hunter drowning with a piano? As a poet and writer, I was ready to love this film.But Campion has taken on a weighty subject – one of the world's most revered Romantic poets - and, this time out, she falls flat. In her commentary, Campion commented that when she began to explore poetry at age 50, she was enthralled by the Keats/Brawne love affair. But it's not so easy to talk about poets.In fact, it's kind of like watching paint dry. ""If you come around, and don't see us doing anything, we're working,"" Brown, Keats' roommate and fellow poet instructs Fanny Brawne. Right. Observing writers practicing their craft is really boring.In the screenplay, Keats attempts to describe the process of creating a poem to Fanny, who is hell bent on learning, dissecting and making sense of poetry.""It's a mystery"" Right.A very few have gotten inside the craft of writing and found words to describe the indescribable. Wistawa Szymborska, a Nobel Prize winning author said in her acceptance speech: ""It's not accidental that film biographies of great  artists are produced in droves. The more ambitious directors seek to reproduce the creative process. But poets are the worst. Their work is hopelessly unphotogenic."" She goes on to speak of inspiration: "".poets answer evasively when asked what it isit's not that they've never know the blessing of this inner impulse. It's just not easy to explain to someone else what you don't understand yourself."" ""Bright Star"" was endowed with a massive pre-publicity campaign. An 8 page insert in Vanity Fair got me jazzed to see a movie about a poet I had mooned over in college. But despite his adorable good looks, complete vulnerability, brilliance and noble spirit, John Keats should have been better left on the page than the big screen.The facts of Keats' short, intensely lived and very disappointing life are compelling. Of course I was moved by his passion and commitment and frustrations. Oh, and the fact that his books didn't sell. But it's a story we've heard before; the artist who is now a part of the canon, of the group consciousness, the accepted and well loved, was disparaged in his/her time, and died penniless. Mozart, Beethoven, Shubert, Dostoevsky, Virginia Woolf. Nothing new there.At the end of the day, the facts of Keats' desperate life and love for Fanny Brawne were just not interesting enough to hang a two hour movie.",Bright Star

Though it was nice not to see any gratuitous sex, just two people who were deeply in love and you felt it. A very nice film and very sad! I am surprised to see the guy who played Mr Brown, Paul Schnider, is American! A very convincing Scotsman and definitely a superb support. Abbie Cornish, I don't think is English, was also brilliant. When she heard of John's death her grief was very realistic, I really felt her pain! Ben Whishaw, as ever, extremely watchable and convincing.

It would have been a much better movie if it was. There don't seem to be much chemistry between the leads. Abbie Cornish's acting is good but not enough to save the movie. John Keats seem somehow to be overshadowed by everyone in this movie. His friend Charles Brown, Fanny's family and Fanny seem to exert greater presence. This is suppose to be a sad, tragic and romantic story but the effect it gave was different. It somehow became a snoozer. Somehow there seem to be some element missing for a good epic romance movie. There should be more of John Keats poems featured in the movie.",Bright Star
94,garyogin,truly awful,1,3 December 2009,"If you're going to do a film on Keats at least make it historically accurate. Campion has failed to even make it an interesting film through her changes of historical fact. It's dull, slow and lacking any dramatic drive. If you love meditation, take a rug to the cinema. You'll have have a great time relaxing. if you love cinema, don't go! It is so slow, I was able to go get more popcorn and not miss anything. scene after scene is of two lovers getting together, not getting together, trying to get together, Keats about to die. It's so lacking in any cinematic understanding that its truly incredulous how this script got through preproduction, unless Campion has no one near her who dares to tell her what a mess the script was in. Most distressing however are the deviations she has made from the truth. Go research the true nature of the relationship.

96,John_Andrew_Knox,It's like a sick eagle looking at the sky,5,7 October 2009,"It took Jane Campion to sap all the energy out of John Keats, a man whose ideas spilled out so fast he omitted letters and entire words, who achieved poetic immortality before age 25, and whose love affair with Fanny Brawne is by turns passionate and tempestuous and tragic. And so much of the original material is extant, in Keats's famous letters and the letters of his family and friends, not to mention the poems. Campion seems determined to disprove the adage that ""you can't go wrong with good material."" What went awry? The story is really focused on Brawne, not Keats, who comes off as a languid cipher of sorts--but at least Campion didn't make him the stereotypical wimp. I'm very open to a cinematic focus broader than the ol' great dead white man. But this doesn't work especially well here because, save for her connection to Keats, Fanny Brawne probably isn't worth a movie. Even many in Keats's circle felt that their immortality was tied to his--for example, his friend Brown's tombstone reads, ""The Friend of Keats.""And, despite what some commenters think, Keats and the Romantics aren't ensconced in the canon and in the popular imagination the way the poets of other eras are--the Romantics were some of the last dead white men into the canon, and have been some of the first to be tossed out, or at least skimmed over.So there needed to be a better fusion of the story of their love affair with a vigorous exploration of Keats's annus mirabilis. Without that tight connection, anyone not up on their British Romantic poetry has to wonder, ""Who cares? Why am I in this theater?"" It is hard, but not impossible, to depict the life of the mind in cinema. Keats is one of the most exceptional examples of the life of a mind in perpetual motion, one in which the passion spills out in all directions, in friendships and family bonds and poems and letters and love affairs. It's a shame that viewers don't get a feel for his extraordinariness. Keats's classic image in poetry is of power and energy in repose, but Campion only got the repose part right. Sigh. Lacking that, it's just another sad love story between some folks long ago. Like the eagle in the ""Elgin Marbles"" poem, ""Bright Star"" wants to soar, but can't get airborne.",Bright Star
97,clementinejames,Beautiful in the rarest of ways,10,10 September 2009,"With such high hopes for a film, a letdown is always lurking the depths of your mind, but in this case, Campion far exceeded my exceptions. Never could I have predicted the deep, meticulously crafted scenes, led so strongly by Abbie Cornish playing Fanny. The heartwrenching emotion in this movie was unlike any other; there has never been a more real portrayal of the most simplistic yet most common emotions that rule the heart. Campion went far beyond the usual ""I am deeply in love; Now I am sad"" and truly captured human idiosyncrasy as she delved into the illogical, irrational minds of two young and suddenly in love individuals. At times, it was almost too much to bear due to how intensely palpable the sadness was. To some, certain scenes or moments may have seemed a little longer than usual, but completely necessary is the silence, just as much as the dialogue. This film perfectly embodied how a simple, real, profound story should be told.If the above were not enough to drive this movie on, the aesthetics were nothing short of spectacular. Each stitch in Fanny's sewing was as beautiful as each scene in a field of lavender or room flooded with butterflies. The magnificent settings, costumes, and natural sunshine pouring into a perfectly decorated room felt not contrived, but simply like a very real dream. As the curtains in Fanny's room got caught in the breeze, it was as if you felt it cooling you down ever so slightly as her content emotion overtook your mind.Ben Whishaw, too, was superb: perfectly embodying the fragile, wondrous poet that was John Keats, so full of tender emotion. Fanny's younger sister was another beautiful element of this film and really stole the show in her own right with her hilarious and endearing perception of life in general. Each character and each line spoken brought something so special to the story. As much witty humor as there was aching sorrow, this movie is not one to be missed.",Bright Star

It is too dull and very pretentious. Ben Whishaw as Keats is a one-trip pony, he has one forlorn expression that never changes. And worse, there is little chemistry between him and Abbie Cornish as Fanny Brawne. What she sees in him, at least as presented here, is beyond me. He is boring, sullen, and dull. I assume the real Keats had more life in him than this dullard. There are also several of what I assume were supposed to be ""AHA"" moments where Keats gets inspiration for his poems. These are silly at best. Paul Scheider as Charles Brown gives some life to the cast but here I have the same question: What does he see in the zombie Keats. A friendship that deep can't be based just on adulation for good poetry. If a thing of beauty does indeed last forever, this movie will have a short shelf life.",Bright Star
99,mccjem,Bright Star...beautiful,9,9 November 2009,"Through brilliant, stunning visuals and intelligent, witty dialogue, Jane Campion's Bright Star celebrates the rapture of passionate love. Using many of the Romantic John Keats' own words--captured for posterity in his poems and love letters to Fanny Brawne, his 'sweet Girl'--Campion has weaved together one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Rich 19th-century fabrics and breathtaking English scenery make Bright Star a sensuous pleasure to experience. But these visuals merely reflect the beauty within, the soul of this film: the love affair of Miss Brawne and Mister Keats. Brawne is passionate about and proud of her fashionable and daring needlework, as is Keats his aspiring albeit more fine-spun poetry, and both share an ardent love of life and a longing for someone with whom to experience it completely. Theirs is the inspiring true story of the rare uniting of equals--of two strong, independent, and intelligent individuals with unique talents and dreams yet deeply matching values and desires. The emotional, intellectual, and subtly sensual affair between Brawne and Keats is captured wonderfully in Bright Star, owing in part to the portrayal and backdrop of those closest to the lovers in their own lives, such as Keats' coarse but caring friend Charles Brown and Brawne's warm mother and endearing siblings. The obtrusively vulgar Brown serves in stark contrast to the gentlemanly Keats, whose integrity and will Brown deeply admires but cannot quite live up to in his own life, while Brawne's loving family--woven seamlessly into the storyline through their presence in scenes of playfully benevolent games, strolls, and dinner-parties-- serves as foil to the equally loving yet singularly feisty Brawne. Through the meaningful and often-tender dialogue and interactions between these vivid characters, Bright Star is able to match beauty of setting with that of soul, a rare feat in a film...as it is in life. Now Bright Star has been attacked as sentimental by the modern, cynical skeptic, and if it were the hackneyed story of a princess and a pauper mindlessly frolicking to their ""fairytale"" ending, his criticism might merit a modicum of respect. But Bright Star is not a fairytale in that empty sense; for the fact is Keats died at the age of 25, and he and Brawne were anything but mindless. So unhappily for the cynic, his venom is ineffectual against this film; for in Bright Star, his normally insidious strain of attack finds its antidote: reality. Bright Star is a *true story* depicting the love affair of two exceptional souls who lived a life (however brief for Keats) of happiness *in this world*. In today's angst-ridden, often gloomy atmosphere of humility and despair--where so many either consciously diffuse or unwittingly (and tragically) breathe in the modern liberal claim of man's depravity (itself merely a mutation of the ancient Christian notion of Original Sin)--the little-known Bright Star shines through in rebellion with pride and exaltation, demanding its viewers resurrect the self-esteem and aspiration they once had as children, and should never have let die as adults. Although Bright Star is deeply uplifting and truly benevolent, one must be prepared to leave its resplendent world tinged with a real sadness. But this sadness does not--it cannot-- abide if one recalls Keats' own poetic words to Brawne (from an early love letter), which encapsulate the film's essence: passionate love for this wondrous world and one's 'Bright Star' in it... ""...I almost wish we were butterflies and liv'd but three summer days--three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain.""",Bright Star
100,crushinghrd,Thank you Jane Campion,8,18 April 2010,"Some days back I saw Jane Campion's Bright Star. A movie on the three year love affair between John Keats and Fanny Brawne. My knowledge of John Keats prior to my witnessing the silver screen adaptation of the love and life of Keats was limited solely to knowing that he was one of the greatest of the Romantic poets and that he had died young. This year, I had come across 'A Thing Of Beauty' as it was a part of my class twelve English syllabus. The movie first came to my attention during the days that were being followed up to the Academy Awards and there was a mention of Abbie Cornish's performance as Fanny Brawne in one of the papers. The writer insisted that her rendition of Keats' love was overlooked for a nomination as the movie in his words, ""wasn't populist enough"". He goes on to say that she even deserved to win, a sentiment that has been echoed in several reviews that I have read. Although I am unfit to have an opinion in this matter having seen none of the nominated actresses' performances, I would certainly go on record to say that the word that comes to mind after seeing Cornish is- (very aptly)luminous. A luminous, soulful, in depth performance in a well written romantic tragedy. From the very beginning one is able to feel and savor the wonderful essence of the movie. It is because of the way it has been, envisioned and shot. The myriad and beautiful hues skillfully capture the time when a look or a brush of a hand could mean the world to someone, had the potential to be a source of endless introspection and many a sleepless nights. It is tinged with romance, the joys, ache, longing and sorrow that inevitably accompanies it. Nineteenth century England has been exquisitely captured by cinematographer Grieg Fraiser who brilliantly alters between light and shade. The costumes are a treat for the eyes as costume designer Janet Patterson brings them to life, many of them on screen by the hand of Fanny Brawne who puts all her mind and energy in creating new styles of collars, flounces and skirts. Ben Whishaw plays the poet with deep thoughtfulness and an aching sorrow in his eyes. From the sincere and absolute dedication to the art form that he holds so highly in esteem till the time Fanny becomes to him the earthly form of what Endymion represents, Ben Whishaw's eyes convey everything. But he is not self centrally brooding away and neither does he ever seem contrived in the way he displays his emotions. Whishaw's Keats also exudes wit, humour, good natured teasing and charm. His thespian skills are a pathway for us to the transcendental world of poets. The actors' sincere efforts make way for a wonderful and complicated yet tangible chemistry. He was, in the most simple manner, a dreamer and she was known for her practicality. He was quiet and not very outgoing and despised outlandishness. She was bold, amusing and ""rated wit the highest"". It seems a bit difficult to understand how they could come to love each other but the death of a dearly loved brother leads Keats to know her better. For her own part, she discovers sides of him when they become neighbours. Though at first, not possessing much knowledge of poetry and being considered by Charles Brown (Paul Schnieder; another immensely talented actor), a friend of Keats, a flirt in whose world fashion occupied central position, her intelligence, kindness and desire to be a part of Keats' life and understand his art paved the way to his heart. Keats does become a bit distracted but their relationship led to the most seminal works produced by him. Fanny Brawne was John Keats' Bright Star. From 1818 to 1821 they carried on their courtship and became subsequently engaged. Their love, however, was cut short by his illness and death at the young age of twenty five. The movie is based mainly on the letters exchanged by the lovers during the course of their separation. With his death looming close over the horizon, in the last few months of his life, his illness only deepened their love for each other. The measure of Abbie Cornish's talent comes across the most when a recently bereaved Fanny walks the Heath in the cold, reciting her beloved's verses that she herself had inspired.",Bright Star
101,marjorie-ricord,A Bright Star in the cinema's world,10,10 June 2010,"A brighter word than bright would be useful to describe this movie. We expected a simple love story told simply: it's deeper, it's a romantic tale. Bright Star is a lovely movie for lovers. Seriously, you should take your boyfriend and see it, and then, you may cry on his shoulders: because the characters are real; Fanny's emotion overtakes your mind, especially at the end of the film: the only thing you can do is to shed a tear... except if you have a heart of stone.   The actors' game is great. Abbie Cornish, who plays Fanny Brawn, is new to me. I didn't know her before Bright Star: she is amazing, I think I should watch other films with this actress. I have already seen Ben Wishaw, who plays John Keats, in other movies (notably in ""The Perfume...""). In Bright Star, he is brilliant again: perfectly embodying the wondrous poet that Keats was, full of tender emotion. Jane Campion, the director, did a wonderful job. Bright Star is delicate, infinitely touching. This is not a simple biography: this is a piece of poetry. Their relationship is based on poetry. We can also say that the movie itself is a beautiful poem, as the real ""Bright Star"" that Keats wrote to Fanny in the 19th century. Like a real poem, Bright Star from Campion, shows wonderful landscapes, the natural environment of a deeply love story, and the delicate words which make up the dialogs. Lights and colors are fresh and gorgeous too. Classical music is a nice touch to finish the movie with.

I would highly recommended this to anyone of any age. I would imagine this to be a very good 'breakup movie'! I cried half of the time. Not because it was sad, but because their love was so clear and they were so deeply made for each other! This movie was so, so beautiful! I can't get over how good it was.

Abbie Cornish's sullen, dead-eyed expression and zero star power, combined with lack of chemistry with Ben Wishaw, doomed it from the start.
