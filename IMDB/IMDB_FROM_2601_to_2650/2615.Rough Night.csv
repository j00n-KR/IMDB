0,SnoopyStyle,tonally challenged,5,30 December 2017,"Jess Thayer (Scarlett Johansson), Alice (Jillian Bell), Blair (Zoë Kravitz), and Frankie (Ilana Glazer) are best friends since college. They are going on a bachelorette vacation in Miami. Jess is getting married and running for state senate. They are joined by Jess's Australian friend Pippa (Kate McKinnon) whom the other girls have never met. Jess reluctantly does cocaine with her girls and it only goes downhill after the dead male stripper.It's a relatively bland comedy until the dead stripper. Then it becomes tonally challenged. It's not dark enough. It's definitely not funny enough. Every passable joke is outnumbered by ones that go flat. The guys are duds and Peter doesn't need this much screen time. The girls should do better than this. There are some funny bits but not everyone is playing at max level.",Rough Night
1,boblipton,Rough Watching,5,20 March 2020,"This is a comedy about what happens when uptight political candidate Scarlett Johansssen goes for a bachelorette party in Miami Beach with her college clique. Comedies about the things that go wrong during such outing and the resecuring of bonds has become its own genre, what with the repetitive Hangover movies -- my suggested tag line of ""It all happens again, in a different place, though"" ... well, I never heard back from the producers -- and Paul Feig's Bridesmaids. And so we are treated to the standard comedic tropes: the drugs; the worried fiancé; the dead stripper, and so forth.The trouble is that although the situations are humorous, only Kate McKinnon as the Aussie Pippa does anything we haven't seen in earlier movies of this type and does it very well. Scarlett Johansson is fine as the worried woman about to be married, but she, like the others at the party, offer performances more dramatic than funny",Rough Night
2,Prismark10,More bridesmaids,4,9 May 2018,"Rough Night is one of those second rate The Hangover/Bridesmaids type of film with predictable characters and unfunny jokes.It wants to be a rude raunchy comedy, yet is too cheap to even film in Miami. It then decides it needs a plot by adding some danger and bad guys with guns.Jess Thayer (Scarlett Johansson) is a budding politician who is running for the State Senate. She is taken by her best friends from college to a hen night in Miami where some of them plan to party hard.Their plans take a left turn when the male stripper accidentally dies and they need to get rid of the body. Meanwhile Jess's boyfriend thinks she is having cold feet about getting married to him and he rushes to be by her side.The film lacks originality, at one point I thought it might end up as Weekend at Bernie's.",Rough Night
3,nogodnomasters,My Turn!!,5,30 June 2017,"Jess (Scarlett Johansson) is running for public office with a prude image. She goes to Miami with three old college friends and an Aussie friend for a bachelorette weekend only to have the film go south as the scripts deviates from the whole bachelorette story into a murder cover up. Kate McKinnon was great, Jillian Bell acceptable and the rest don't know how to do comedy.NO NO NO This is not as funny as ""Bridesmaid.' Kristen Wiig got more laughs in one airplane scene than this whole film. If you watch the previews,you have seen all of the film worth watching.F-word. Sex talk.

4,kosmasp,Very rough night/things,8,7 April 2021,There are things that reminded me of a comedy from the 90s - back then all male cast. The main cast that is. Here you have an all female cast - and the comedy and humor is as rough on the edges as it can be. And I have to say this is not for the easily offended! It goes through with things which I did not expect (I'll just say security camera/footage).But that is not all and of course I understand if you have issues with the overall raunchy and down and dirty things this has in store for you. Suspension of disbelief included. All the actors are doing a stellar job and you should root for them - even if the conclusion may be a bit too neat all things considered ...,Rough Night
5,jboothmillard,Rough Night,5,6 September 2020,"I saw the trailer for this movie, and it did look like it would be good fun, so I don't know how I missed the opportunity to see it at the cinema, oh well, I'm glad when I did get top watch it at home. Basically, in 2006, Jess (Scarlett Johansson), Alice (Jillian Bell), Blair (Zoë Kravitz) and Frankie (Ilana Glazer) were best friends and had a fantastic time at a college Halloween party. A decade later, they all since gone in separate directions, with Jess running for state senator, Alice is a teacher elsewhere, Blair is a New York lawyer going through a custody battle with her ex-husband for their three-year-old son, and Frankie is a jobless activist who has been in trouble with the police. Jess is also engaged to be married to boyfriend Peter (Paul W. Downs), so Alice organises a trip to Miami to have a private bachelorette party. They are also joined by Pippa (Kate McKinnon) (her nickname is ""Kiwi"" as she is mistaken as New Zealand), Jess's friend from her semester in Australia. The friends get high and party at a club before heading back to their rented apartment. Then they decide to hire a male stripper. When the stripper (Ryan Cooper) arrives, Jess is uncomfortable with his straddling and rough talk. An excitable Alice wants her turn and jumps on him, causing them to both fall and the stripper to hit his head on the edge of the fireplace, killing him. They panic and must decide whether to report the accidental death to the police or not. During the panic, Jess takes a call from Peter and mentions the stripper being hired, he asks her if she still wants to marry him, he hears her shout ""no"", talking to her friends, before the call is cut by the phone being smashed. Peter is confused and unsure whether Jess meant what she said and decides to travel to Miami to convince Jess to take him back. The friends purchase a burner phone and call Blair's uncle Jack (Peter Francis James) for advice. After telling them they moved the body, he tells them they could face up to fifteen years in prison, unless there is no evidence of anything ever happening. The friends decide to dispose of the body by throwing it into the ocean, and start cleaning up the mess. They are almost caught by their horny neighbours Lea (Demi Moore) and Pietro (Ty Burrell), but, after volunteering, Pippa successfully manages to dump the body into the ocean, and has a bad fall crashing the jet ski back to shore. But then the friends notice the neighbours have a security camera on the house. Blair, being the one that Lea and Pietro were flirting with the most, is sent in to seduce the couple and obtain the footage, only to discover after their sexual encounter that the cameras don't work. By this point, the friends settle back in the house, only to see the body has washed up on the shore and they have to come up with another plan. Meanwhile, Peter continues his road trip up to Miami wearing a diaper, like ""Sad Astronaut"" captain Lisa Nowak, to avoid stopping on the way. A police officer (Colton Haynes) arrives and starts groping Frankie, she knocks him out, and that is when the friends realise, removing his trousers, that he is the real stripper, Scotty McBody, that was hired, and they question who they have killed. They use the stripper's car to try to dispose of the body again only to be forced to return to the house following a car accident. Whilst talking, Alice finds out that Jess had a bridal with Frankie and Blair and did not invite her. Jess verbally scolds Alice for being obsessively clingy and storms off to the bathroom, prepared to take the consequences. At this point, two police officers arrive, Detective Frazier (Dean Winters) and Detective Ruiz (Enrique Murciano), and the women decide to admit what they have done. The officers tell them they are not in trouble as they have killed a wanted violent criminal. As the women are interrogated, Pippa sees on the faces of the two officers on the television, they are also wanted criminals. The men realise they are caught out, so they tie up the women and the real stripper, who has woken up, and threaten to shoot them until they hand over some diamonds. Having been in the shower, Jess has missed all the drama downstairs. She opens and reads a card from Alice, which acknowledges their friendship, and she prepares to go down to reconcile, until she sees the commotion. She manages to subdue one of the captors and handcuffs him in the bathroom and fights the second criminal when he prepares to kill Blair. After Alice shoots the second captor, the first one reappears having freed himself from the toy handcuffs only to be run over when Peter, high on the drugs he took to keep him awake, comes crashing through the front of the house and kills him. Jess reaffirms that she wants to marry Peter and the two marry that weekend, with Pippa officiating, and enjoy a foam party with their friends in attendance. Frankie and Blair decide to reunite as a couple and Alice hooks up with Scotty the stripper. In a mid-credits scene, Pippa sings a song to the audience at Jess's election with lyrics relating to their experience. In a post-credits scene, Alice finds the stolen diamonds which were hidden in the box of penis-shaped pasta. Also starring Ryan Cooper as Jay, Karan Soni as Raviv, and Devin Ratray as Bud. Johansson is good as the bride-to-be, Bell is great as the excitable BFF, McKinnon has a dodgy Australian accent but is amusing, Kravitz and Glazer are fine, and Moore and Burrell as the sleazy shaggers are entertaining. You know what to expect with this kind of movie, a bad situation gets worse, more ridiculous, and slightly over-the-top as it goes along, but that's what makes you laugh, most the slapstick and risqué jokes work well, it is an enjoyable comedy. Worth watching!",Rough Night
6,tavm,Rough Night was funny enough as an adult comedy,7,24 June 2017,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This was quite a funny and raunchy comedy about a reunion of four female college friends with one of them about to get married. The last one mentioned has a friend from Australia also join in the fun. Then the night turns a little dark. I'll stop there and just say this was funny enough for recommendation. I also liked some of the true-life real stories mentioned to give ideas to some of the characters. So on that note, go for it if you're curious about Rough Night.",Rough Night
7,neil-476,OK,7,8 May 2018,"Jess is getting married, so has a hen night with her oldest friends including mouthy but clingy Alice, and Australian Pippa who hasn't met the others. All is going well until Alice leaps aboard a stripper they have hired... and kills him.
Just like London buses, you wait ages for a film about badly behaved women on a hen weekend, and then two come along at once - see also Girls' Trip from a couple of weeks ago. This one has the added factor of the stripper's death, which brings an element of Weekend At Bernie's into play - what do you do with an unwanted dead body? Clue: you don't phone the police and come clean about an accidental death.This film is quite amusing, a touch sentimental here and there, a bit politically correct, rude without being raunchy, and actually has plot elements which arrive with some surprise. It also has Jillian Bell, whose Alice is, at times, truly annoying, and Kate McKinnon who steals the film as effectively as she did in Ghostbusters. Scarlet Johansson is effective at glueing the whole thing together.There is a post-credits scene which I appreciated. I would have appreciated it more had it been mid-credits!",Rough Night
8,FlashCallahan,Very bad thing......,2,1 July 2017,"Jess is a politician who reunites with three of her college friends for a bachelorette weekend in Miami. The night of hard partying soon takes a dark turn when a male stripper accidentally dies at their beach house. Amid trying to cover it up, the friends find themselves becoming closer when it matters most......When this film was first made in 1999, it was funny, but the dark streak it had, made it one of the more standout independent films of the late nineties. It had interesting characters, some really good twists in the narrative, and it all ended with a deliciously nasty ending.This is the the remake, and like last years Ghostbusters, the sexes have changed, just because it would be interesting to see how women would react to a same situation.But instead of going down a dark alley when it comes to humour, the writers decide to play it safe and go down gross out ally, taking a detour to pratfall park along the way.The cast are wasted with the script, it's terrible. So we have the friends all together and they have the predictable traits you'd expect in a last film like this.You get the smart one, the party animal, the slightly cuckoo one, the beyond bonkers one, and the one the writers forget about, played by Kravitz.It's just too predictable to be funny. The jokes are sub par, secondary characters are written in a way that should make them ultimately bizarre, but the actors portraying them look embarrassed, especially Demi Moore.It all ends with the group learning life lessons, and becoming the best of friends, before all living happily ever after.Even though they have committed and assisted in manslaughter.Stick with Very Bad Things.This is just Very Bad.",Rough Night
9,Hellmant,"Not as dark as it promises to be, but still funny.",7,29 June 2017,"'ROUGH NIGHT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A dark comedy involving five friends that meet for a bachelorette party in Miami, ten years after four of them went to school together, and things go horribly wrong when they accidentally kill a male stripper. It stars Scarlett Johansson, Jillian Bell, Zoe Kravitz, Kate McKinnon and Ilana Glazer. Paul W. Downs, Demi Moore and Ty Burrell also costar in the film. It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Lucia Aniello, and it was written by Aniello and Downs (the duo also co-produced the flick). The movie's gotten better than average reviews from critics, but it's disappointed at the Box Office so far (many think for sexist reasons). I enjoyed it.Jess (Johansson) is a somewhat successful politician that's currently running for office. She's also about to be married, and going on a bachelorette party, in Miami, with three old college friends (Bell, Kravitz and Glazer); whom she's become distant with over the years. Jess also invites her new friend, Pippa (McKinnon), who the others meet for the first time. After the girls all do cocaine together, and party at the clubs, they hire a stripper. When one of the friends accidentally kills the stripper, the women all panic and make things worse by trying to conceal their crime. The women all (of course) bond in the process.The movie is funny, crude and very dark (until the end at least); all things that are great to see in a female driven film. The story is similar to a lot of previous dark male comedies though, but it's nice to see a female twist on it at least. I think all of the actresses do a good job in the movie, and it's mostly funny. I was disappointed with the climax though, which kind of gives the film a little bit too much of a lighter (more happy) ending. I don't want to ruin it for you, but the film is definitely not as dark as it promises to be.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/W6So6Kz52VQ",Rough Night

11,Robert_duder,So ridiculously dumb funny that it works,7,9 September 2017,"Bridesmaids was such a massive hit that clones have come along every so often. Even Ghostbusters was a clone of sorts with Paul Feig helming it. I never saw a trailer for this but I suspected it would be the same old. I was never a fan of Bridesmaids so I wasn't sure how this would be. So my expectations were practically nil. Rough Night is insanely stupid. It is one ridiculous mishap after another and it probably feels forced and absurd and guess what? It's kind of amusing. It's slapstick funny and it's just enough predictability that you have fun with it. It has a story and fun characters and just a very old school 80's comedy vibe in the vein of Weekend At Bernies or Revenge of The Nerds. There is some serious strong direction to this if their goal was a certain demographic. They know how to use each character, even the supporting ones. I wanted to roll my eyes and just not like it but I DID!I think they were very fortunate to get the star power of Scarlett Johansson in the film and she seems like odd fit for the film but she actually is great! It's a nice turn to see her in a silly comedy playing the popular but down to earth girl. She fits in nicely and plays the role very well. Jillian Bell is the ""Melissa McCarthy"" of the movie. She is a little more subtle than what she could be which is good because it doesn't cross being annoying. Zoë Kravitz and Ilana Glazer round out the college foursome. They are definitely secondary characters but with some definitive development even if it's basic. They still had some funny moments and carry some of the story as well. Kravitz was the better of the two in my opinion. One of the most overused comediennes right now is Kate McKinnon but...she does have timing and star power and she is her typical type of role here. So fans of hers won't be disappointed and her and Johansson and Bell have very good chemistry together. The five of them in fact work very well together amongst all the silliness and that is a high point of the film. Paul W. Downs, Colton Haynes, Ryan Cooper, Ty Burrell and Demi Moore all have small but terrific fun and often hilarious roles in the film. Burrell probably sticks out more than most but he serves her purpose. Downs, Cooper and Hayes are amazing in their respective small roles. Interesting fact, Paul Downs is also a co-writer of the film (explains why he wrote himself in as Johansson's fiancée) and I give him kudos for a script that is really dumb but works. Lucia Aniello is the director and I think it's good for a film like this to have a female director but that being said I'm not sure she has the experience to really make this impactful. The story works but I wonder if someone with more handle on comedy could have really made it even better. She has never really had any experience on a big screen film. Regardless these are only a few things that make the film not as good as maybe it could have been BUT I still liked it quite a bit. Maybe it was my extremely low expectations or boredom of the evening but it's fun, silly and a good flick for girls night or just to entertain in a simple brainless way. 7.5/10",Rough Night
12,dromasca,it's just not funny (enough),4,4 June 2021,"There are quite a few reasons why I should have liked the 'Rough Night'. First of all, this is a girly version of the genre of movies in which a group of men meet a round number of years after graduating from high school or college to try to relive the madness of their youth and face the changes brought by the erosion of time, just for extraordinary things to happen and events to take the wrong turn. The film is directed by a woman - Lucia Aniello - who is a feature film debutante but an experienced author of many TV comedies and acted by a formidable team of comedy actresses that includes Scarlett Johansson, plus a short appearance by Demi Moore. So, there should be a lot of feminine comic energy in this gathering for an exclusively feminine weekend, which begins exuberantly and in which complications do not take long to appear. Unfortunately, my expectations were not confirmed. The main problem with the film is - in short - that it is not funny enough.Where are the roots of the failure? Coming from the world of sitcomsLucia Aniello seems to enjoy the freedom of expression on the big screen in the absence of the constraints of peak hours, big networks programming. Her heroines behave in the same way, getting to Miami on a weekend of extreme fun, which also includes the bachelorette party for one of them. The ladies happily use four-letter words and consume huge amounts of alcohol and 'recreational' drugs. Unfortunately, their characters also have exactly the psychological depth of the heroines from TV series with 25-minute episodes. This superficiality could have been offset by more comic madness, but this is also missing. Each of the heroines of 'Rough Night' have her own reasons not to feel at ease at this reunion after ten years, and the actresses also seem somewhat constrained to be permanently in the space of the villa where the reunion takes place. The enclosed space is another unnecessary legacy of the television genre. A corpse also appears, which can be a problem or a source of crazy comedy. This thread is not efficiently explored either, we have seen movies with more funny scenes in which the characters try to get rid of corpses. The balance between a corpse and a feel-good movie is a hard thing to manage. The beautiful and talented actresses who appear in 'Rough Night' fail to save the text and situations from being of faint comic at best. The trailer and the still photos look much better and are funnier than the movie itself.",Rough Night
13,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,3 September 2017,"Rough NightWomen only get speeding tickets if the cop doesn't find their sobbing sufficient.Unfortunately for the women in this comedy the waterworks won't get them off murder.For her bachelorette party, Jess' (Scarlett Johansson) estranged friends from college (Kate McKinnon, Zoë Kravitz, Ilana Glazer, Jillian Bell) take her to Miami for a weekend filled with booze, drugs and dancing. During the frivolity, however, they accidentally kill a male-stripper. Now they must dispose of his body before the cops arrive.Things take a turn for the worst when the actual stripper they hired shows up.A raunchy girls' trip that reduces its female leads down to obnoxious frat boy stereotypes, this feminist comedy foolishly believes a derivative script filled with limp dick jokes is empowering to women or even funny for that matter.Besides, real women on all-girls' getaways spend their time texting their boyfriends to make sure they're not cheating.

14,westsideschl,Dumb,2,19 September 2017,"Gawd, who is this movie written for? Is it just an automatic money making ""no-brainer"" (and I mean that literally) to have a female coterie reunite years later for alcohol, partying, clubbing, male stripper all at an exclusive vacation locale? Plot has been done too many times including guys' versions. Fifty years of progress in portraying intelligent resourceful women has been reduced and characterized to loud intoxicated ""b..hes"" trying to outdo each other in acting the stupidest. Oh, more dumbness in added subplot of some stranger dying which expands into a not believable, suppose to be funny, crime clean up mess which itself has been done too many times in film. Demi Moore makes a brief appearance and as in ""Blind"" shows little acting skill. In both films she basically just hangs on some guy and smiles.",Rough Night

16,tabuno,A Darker Edged Comedy,8,11 January 2019,"18 June 2017. This female version of the raunchy wild night out genre offers up a lot that the typical storyline of past such movies have tread. Yet there seems to be a more nuanced emotional bonding and reflective, albeit drugged mindfulness or least an attempt at one than the completely dumb-witted male outings of other movies. The significantly higher IMDb ratings among young and older females over males might suggest either the pent up sexist lack of a predominant female presence in the immoral, debauchery of in past movies is being acknowledged or that there is an increased appreciation for how there might be a vague underlying morality that women continue to hold onto even when their mental faculties are diminished.This summer dark comedy of entertainment is supposed to be crazy. The fragile balance between graphic harder edged violence, emotional drama, and slapstick comedy along with one line gutter humor is strewn throughout with some intelligence at times. At least this movie is not boringly a rubber stamped product of the same dialogue, same characters, same outcomes directed in the same way as all the others. There is a attempt here for a more glaring emotional punch in your face with grittier harsher, female deviltry that isn't always politely acceptable on its face. Yet the eventual camaraderie among female friends and how they do so seems much more qualitatively distinctive in a much more compelling and attractive way that ultimately makes this movie a cut above.",Rough Night
17,Reno-Rangan,Bachelorette gone wrong!,6,4 January 2018,"This kind of girls night out flicks are not fun anymore. Yet it is hard to ignore them from watching. So I watched it not expecting anything special out of it. And I did not get any. But... it was okayish. Moreover, Scarlett Johansson was the main reason I wanted to watch it. You can't always do superhero, action films. This is something offbeat. Often need to take this path, no to fail miserably, but to relax from the mainstream. So this was enjoyable, but not by all.It is like the female version of 'Hangover'. Five friends go to Miami for one of theirs bachelorette party. It's supposed to be fun without any rules, but a disaster strikes in the early and makes them to cover all the evidence. The night turns their worst nightmare ever. How they manage to come out of it are the remaining film that revealed with a twist at the end.The reception was as expected, but it was not that bad if you are seeking only a timepass. It ended like there could be a sequel, but now it seems very unlikely. One of the issues with the film is it was so traditional narrative. With so many jokes repeated from other flicks. The majority won't approve that. As far as I think it is watch and forget kind of film. An average film. Disliking it does not change what it is!6/10",Rough Night
18,cruise01,Rough Night can not be any more rough with its redundant humor with a likable cast.,5,17 June 2017,"Rough Night is the raunchy comedy about a bachelorette party gone wrong with a group of friends. Cannot compare this to The Hangover movie, which has a similar premise but done way better. Rough Night has its fair share of laughs but the substance gets repetitive which does not make it any more funny after the joke has been used. The plot follows Jess (Scarlett Johansson) who is running for senate is about to get married. Her friend Alice (Jillian Bell) wants to throw her a bachelorette party along with Frankie (Ilana Glazer) and Blair (Zoe Kravitz). They all go to Miami to party and Jess Australian friend Pippa (Kate McKinnon) also joins in. They go clubbing, get drunk, and do cocaine. Also, they hire a male stripper which he accidentally gets killed when he cracks his head. With the ladies freaking out about getting the police involved and drugs being on the scene. They decide to get rid of the body which nothing works out as planned. Rough Night does have the cast that had potential to be in a great comedy movie. Scarlett Johansson is a stunning actress. Kate McKinnon is so weird and awkward but love her oddness in every role she has been in. Jillian Bell is also a funny actress that I am slowly growing on her, as she has been the center of a comedic role. Ilana Glazer, I have not seen her in much but her role was decent playing an activist character. Zoe Kravitz is also decent as well. What worked with the film is it does have some fun stupid humor. But I feel like most of the fun humor was already shown in the trailer. Otherwise, what did not worked with the movie is it can go so far with its penis jokes, sex toys humor, and a sequence of Jess fiancé Peter wearing adult diapers and roaming around the gas station doing favor for cash while going on an all night road trip to Miami. It all has its cheap laughs and gags but when the humor is repetitive it just gets dull from there on and out. The plot is simplistic. Group of friends that was once close meet up again. Sure, they have drama against each other that works itself out in the end. They go on a wild party frenzy with drugs, alcohol, and talk about sex toys, penis, etc. Yes, it is a raunchy comedy movie so you can expect sexual humor. Even when the girls come across a sex crazed swinging neighbors (played by some funny cameos). And there is also a small plot twist, which does work with the movie. But not really a satisfying direction. Overall, Rough Night could have been better. It has its cheap laughs and gags. A cast that could have worked. It just played out with its repeat on the humor with no plot. A concept that's been used before.",Rough Night
19,Floated2,Tries too hard,2,9 November 2018,"Rough Night was a film which was severely panned by both critics and fans alike resulting into a strong poor box office flop. We can tell exactly the type of film this tried being simply from the trailers.Seeing many comparisons to other films such as the Hangover, Bridesmaids, Very Bad Things, and Weekend at Bernie's. Rough Night takes roughly elements from those films and mixes it together but it's overall result is not as good as those listed films.What hurts the film is that it is simply not funny as it tries far too hard in being overly sexual, raunchy and crude. A lot of the jokes were misses and just over the the top.The story is preferable in the get go as we know that the first guy who comes into their place isn't the actual hired stripper but a criminal of sorts. The film somewhat feels like an overly long SNL sketch.We wonder as to why Scarlet Johansson took this role as she seems above these low brow comedies. Overall the characters weren't funny especially Jillian Bell who tries far too far for laughs. Same with Kate McKinnon. Ilana Glazer and Zoe Kravitz were quite decent and interesting.It seems as this film's flopping may have took a hit to Scarlet's career as this film will be completely forgettable.",Rough Night
20,TheMovieDiorama,Rough Night is a comedy I should not have enjoyed...but I did.,7,28 February 2018,"For those of you who follow my reviews or know me personally would know that I just don't like comedies. I hardly ever laugh, find them cringeworthy and would rather watch a depressing film about a serial killer. But here we are, a film that has surprised me and made me laugh. Not once. Not twice. We're talking multiple occasions. What!? Gasp. Shock. Horror. I thought Rough Night was hilarious. I don't know if it's because I was hyper on confectionary goodness and sugary drinks but yes I enjoyed the hell out of this. We follow a group of girls who throw a bachelorette party for one of their friends. Clubs, drinking, drugs and the attempted removal of a guy they just killed. I shouldn't have liked this, reason being is that it's just another formulaic comedy where our characters relive the past only for the present to hit them in the face, they argue and make up. The end. So yes, it is formulaic. It also dragged towards the end and the laughs started to become inconsistent. But...but but but...the majority of the runtime was packed with hilarity and that's pretty much down to the script and charismatic performances. Scarlett Johansson was fantastic, I was slightly ""meh"" at the beginning but warmed to her comedic timing. Kate McKinnon though, stole the whole damn film. Her forced Australian accent just killed me. Yet again, her exaggerated acting and dialogue execution just made her hilarious. Demi Moore though...yikes! Good on her but...yikes! The scenarios that are characters are put under were varied, somewhat inventive and outrageously funny. Particularly scenes where they attempt to hide the body, who knew glasses with a phallic shaped object attached would make me laugh (immature...I know). I thought the script was pretty consistent throughout, there were times where jokes didn't always hit but for the most part I either smiled or laughed out loud. I needed to be cheered up, I needed a laugh, I needed a good time. This film did all that successfully.",Rough Night

22,jtindahouse,Far from perfect but I somehow enjoyed it,6,26 March 2018,"I'm a big fan of 'Broad City' the series, and seeing that this was made by some of the same people and had one of its stars in it I expected myself to quite enjoy it. And I did - in a way. 'Rough Night' is quite a strange movie in the sense that I can see why it is terrible in a great number of ways, and yet I still somehow quite enjoyed myself. And if you enjoy yourself in a comedy is that not all you can hope to do? Well maybe not all you can hope for but certainly a large part of what you hope for. The film's many flaws include a husband storyline that is rarely funny and adds very little to the film other than to pad the runtime and get the characters out of a situation near the end, a storyline that requires you to suspend all belief and rationality, characters that are obviously exaggerated - but in a number of cases far too greatly so and finally a lack of gag creation (meaning the film relies only on funny lines from characters and never actually creates funny situations that take care of themselves) just to name a few.The dialogue is one of the only things the film really has going for it, but I did really enjoy that aspect for the most part. It was very similar to the dialogue you'd find in an episode of 'Broad City'. Very dark, off-beat and clever. I also really enjoyed Kate McKinnon's performance. I can see why her acting would not be to everyone's liking, but to me she is very funny. I'm not sure if I'd recommend this film to people or not. There are certainly better comedy movies out there, but this one isn't as far off the mark as some people might have you believe.",Rough Night

Nice to Scarlett Johansson do a comedy, she mostly has been in drama or action, but I gotta say she was pretty funny. The other females here also don't disappoint, Bell, Kravitz, Glazer and McKinnon all play off each other quite well. I really brought there friendship, and that they all had a history together.

The movie opens about 10 years earlier, with Scarlett, Jillian and Zoe in college and best friends. Jump to the present, and Scarlett is engaged to be married and her old friends want to throw her a bachelorette party in Miami. Kate is a newer friend of Scarlett's that joins them in Miami and becomes fast friends with everyone except Jillian, who seems to be just a tad jealous of her relationship with Scarlett. They all party, get drunk, do drugs, and wind up back at their rented beach house for some more fun. A male stripper is called and an accident happens that leaves the man dead. After a little brainstorming, the girls decide to get rid of the body but of course, things get even more complicated-nothing seems to go as planned. There is a funny cameo of some beach neighbors, who turn out to be swingers. As the end credits start, there is a scene and stay till the very end or you will miss an important plot point getting resolved. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use, bloody images and sexual content- no real nudity but lots of penis shaped objects-and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes.

31,Enchorde,So disappointed... stay clear of this,2,9 March 2019,"I actually had some hopes of this, but that quickly disappeared in a juvenile bog of just not funny stuff. Already in the first scene, a game of beer-pong at a frat party, the movie revealed it's true nature. The joke in that scene to establish the tone of the movie? I am actually not sure, but perhaps that drinking way too much is fun. Oh, great fun. So fun, the main character Jess afterwards says; ""I don't want to go to those parties..."" while her drunk neighbour urinates in her bedroom. You see all the fun we can expect here.So what do her girlfriends do when it years later is time for Jess's bacholerette party (that she doesn't want to have - she says so repeatedly). They fly to Miami, loan a beach house, and do a lot of drugs. Seriously not funny. All because, when a man turns up (who the girls believe to be a stripper - which Jess once again repeatedly protests) they can't (or just don't for whatever reason) call the police. What do they do instead? More drugs, and then eat pizza. That is the quality of the jokes you'll get in this movie.But actually, that is not the worst part of the movie. Many movies has been built around morally dubious themes and can be really fun. Weekend at Bernies, Slim Susie are a few examples. The big difference is that the characters in those movies, with all their faults, are actually likeable. The five girls here are just a bunch of selfish, mean and spoiled brats. It was impossible to even sympathize with them. The least reproachable of them, Jess, played by Scarlett Johansson (she is otherwise a good actress who is able to make a character come through the screen), was in the best of places just bland. It made this movie impossible, the characters killed a lot more than the stripper. They killed the entire movie.I actually can't remember laughing even once at this (and just saying, between my wife and me, I was the one who thought best of the movie).

32,rgkarim,A Rough Night For This Reviewer,5,17 June 2017,"Bachelorette parties, a sacred ritual to help a young woman transition from single life into the world of marriage. Of course, like most things, modern traditions have adulterated with new traditions and rituals that leads for a rather ""exciting"" night. So why not make another movie about it. Tonight, my friend and I hit the theater to cover the latest comedy to ""grace"" the big screen entitled Rough Night! What does this obviously titled film have in store for us? As always, please read on to find out and help determine whether or not it is worth your money to hit the theater. So what do you get? For once the trailers were pretty spot on with their portrayal of this movie. Rough night is a very raunchy, simplistic, and over the top comedy that has little sustenance outside of the attempt at humor. It's ridiculousness at times is clever, but these moments are few and far between, buried under the comedy rubble that fills this movie. Aggressive innuendos come rushing out of the woodwork, many delivered in the overdramatic manner that somehow seems to be popular and entertaining to many. The all-star cast assembled to for this film are okay, dropping their dynamic acting range for superficial roles filled with cursing and satire. Lazy writing also doesn't help sell the comedy factor, primary thanks to the consistent cursing, shouting of the male genitalia, overzealous drug use, and cringe worthy catchphrases. Kate Mickinnon is able to salvage some parts of the film with her usual tricks, working the Australian accent with her pizazz and spot-on timing. Story wise, nothing special here. Rough Night's plot is about 80% revealed in the trailers and there is little surprise left for you in the audience. Some of the more adult moments will be the eye widening magic you are seeking, but again these are often awkward uncomfortable, or unnecessary. Still the movie's tale had some surprising character development and a nice twist thrown into the mix to help keep things dynamic. The morals hit close to home on some level, but again are robbed by another bout of stupidity. I know, you aren't there for the character developments and rugged plot, but other comedies have learned to balance things and that is where this movie fails. In the end though here are my likes and dislikes: LIKES:  Kate McKinnon  Good, upbeat soundtrack  Short Run Time  More dynamic storylineDISLIKES:  Incredibly stupid  Excessive cursing  Aggressive humor  Trailers Ruined most of the movie  Inappropriate at many times  Shallow story  Annoying characters  Dropped plots  Overacting  Limited target audienceTHE VERDICT:It's nice to see a movie fit the expectations set by the advertising, but it's sad that this is a form of entertainment. Rough night fails to find balance and resorts to cheap parlor tricks known as adult humor. Sure there are clever components (primarily thanks to the boyfriend and Kate), but even they can't save the movie from the monotonous laziness that is to come. kWhy must it be overacted? I don't know, but nevertheless this movie failed on many accounts. Recommended audience members include bachelorettes, girls nights out, or fans of one of the cast. For the rest though, skip this movie until it darkens the library of Netflix. My scores are:Comedy: 5.5 Movie Overall: 3.0",Rough Night
33,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Rough Night,6,21 June 2017,"Jess (played by Scarlett Johansson who was better than I thought she'd be) is getting married soon. Her friends from college decide to plan a debauchery getaway for her in Miami, Florida. They party hard on their first night in the Magic City by hitting a club, snorting some cocaine, and getting real drunk. They then head back to their vacation home. While at said home, the five women hire a stripper and accidentally kill him. Oops!That's the gist of Rough Night, my latest review. Modeling the female version of movies like The Hangover, Very Bad Things, and Weekend at Bernie's, ""Night"" has a few laughs and even trudges slightly into black comedy territory. My reason for a mixed rating however, is simple: Rough Night isn't as dark or risk-taking as ""Things"" and it isn't as funny as ""Hangover"". As for ""Bernie's"", well ""Night"" only hints at the mocking of a dead body during a couple of scenes in the trailer. Those scenes were obviously left on the cutting room floor. Distributed by Columbia Pictures and clocking in at just over 100 minutes, Rough Night is standard yet shoddily directed by Lucia Aniello (this is her feature film debut). She provides ""Night"" with the usual shtick for a hard, R-rated endeavor. There's some drug references (and drug use), some heavy sexual innuendo, and some vulgar, unladylike language. Some of the material sticks and some of it awkwardly bounces off. As for Aniello's group of actresses (Zoe Kravitz, Jillian Bell, and Kate McKinnon to name three), well they're stiff at first but then gel together with variably decent chemistry. This is despite some real odd casting choices in the form of Johansson (mentioned earlier) as a woman running for state senate and Demi Moore as one half of a neighboring, swinging couple. Strangely, the most humorous sequences in Rough Night involve Jess's fiancé named Peter (played by Paul W. Downs). He thinks she doesn't want to marry him anymore so he quickly drives straight from Washington D.C. to Miami in a diaper (just revert back to that astronaut story with Lisa Nowak in 2007). This is all done to win Jess back (talk about bad miscommunication).In conclusion, if I had to decipher the biggest flaw in ""Night"", it would be the ending. I won't give anything away but it feels as though the screenwriters ran out of ideas, threw in a regimented twist, and abruptly copped out on real-life culminations (the five friends could never fully get away with what they did). Talk about borderline hackwork. Overall, Rough Night gets two and a half stars from this critic. It could serve as a harmless rental when it eventually comes out on DVD.",Rough Night
34,yoggwork,Jokes and jokes are basically in place,4,18 February 2019,"Jokes and jokes are basically in place, but the plot and hangover are much worse. This kind of bridge section is straight line narrative facts at the non-explosive point.",Rough Night
35,bkrauser-81-311064,Mediocre but Still Funny in Spurts,7,17 June 2017,"If Bridesmaids (2011) was proof that the ladies can play just as rough in delivering truly inspired raunch-com moments, then Rough Night is incontrovertible proof that they can also deliver mediocre fair with the same lack of conviction as their coasting male counterparts. Is it funny; yeah in spurts. Can it be a little cloying; yeah at times. Is it the best version of what it could be? Perhaps that's the wrong question.Rough Night reunites college roommates Jess (Johansson), Alice (Bell) Blair (Kravitz) and Frankie (Glazer) who are planning one last blowout soiree before Jess takes the plunge into married life. They all rendezvous in sunny Miami, and meet up with Jess's friend from Australia Pippa (McKinnon). From there Alice plans a fun night on the town followed by a private party at their rented beach house. Things go terribly wrong however after the girls invite a stripper into the house and wind up with a dead body on their hands.Part of what will end up working for you about Rough Night has a lot to do with you look for in a comedy. At times the film channels the frazzled energy of The Hangover (2009) while at others it's stretching for the ""what are we going to do now"" immediacy of a Guy Ritchie crime comedy. It sometimes sinks in the tepid character dynamics of a late-period Blake Edwards sex comedy while at others times it outright revels in pure absurdity. The center narrative stitch however is farce - trading on the buffoonery of our characters to establish much of the movie's important story elements.This however becomes a crutch as the movie limps away from the halfway point. Once we get a good idea of what's going on, it becomes obvious that there just aren't enough levers for this movie to pull to keep everything going. And instead of relying on broad characters and an increasing array of improbable circumstances (the bread and butter of any good farce), the movie cuts back and forth between, not people but groups that are only tangentially related to the story proper. As a result Rough Night starves itself on its own lack of possibilities.Such groups by the way, include Demi Moore and Ty Burrell who play sexed-up beach neighbors with an eye for Blair. Their inclusion results in one of the film's most problematic moments by far. On the other end we have Paul W. Downs and his groomsmen. The juxtaposition of Jess's gathering and Paul W. Downs's rather demure stag party provides the funniest moments in the entire film. And because Downs's moments start with the unexpected and only grow more bizarre from there, the man threatens to run away with what feels like a compromised movie. Ironic since its supposed to be about the women.Look, if you really want to prime yourself for a good movie going experience, you shouldn't be asking yourself if this is the best movie they could have made with this kind of material. Instead ask yourself if this is the best movie that has been made out of this kind of material. In comparison to Stag (1996) and Very Bad Things (1998), Rough Night is clearly a winning choice. Though personally when it comes to movies about what to do with a dead body, the gold standard will always be Weekend at Bernie's (1989).",Rough Night
36,arungeorge13,The actors are having way more fun than the audience! [+43%],4,2 September 2017,"'Rough Night' feels too derivative and unoriginal at times that the viewer would recall having had more fun watching films with a similar premise such as 'The Hangover' or 'Very Bad Things' or even 'Weekend at Bernies'. It is pretty clear that the actors had a ball shooting for the film but somehow the same doesn't seem to translate onto the screen. This could mainly be attributed to the ""stock"" writing and ""template"" characters that the writers / director chooses to revolve the setting around. We have the usual successful/not-so-successful/happy/not-so-happy members of a girl-gang (who have been friends from college) meeting up over a weekend for the bachelorette of one of them. Jess (Johansson) is an aspiring politician (and about to get married to Peter), Alice a mom (apparently, an awesome one or something?), Blair (Zoe Kravitz) who recently had a separation, and Frankie (Ilana Glazer) an activist (or so she thinks). You see how hard to explain that was. For a 100 minute movie, none of the characters other than Jess, have any identifiable arcs. More so, because Johansson clearly towers over the rest in terms of star-power.The foursome engage in raunchy 'Miami' things like drunken-dancing at a nightclub, cocaine-snorting, and even hire a male stripper at their weekend residence. In the meantime, they're joined by Pippa (Kate McKinnon), Jess' best friend but an outsider to the group. What ensues is a having-fun-gone-terribly-wrong scenario that's been seen executed a lot better in other genre films. The comedy is definitely there, and we can even observe the cast trying their best to hold together their notable chemistry, but unfortunately it ends up looking a lot less exciting than it was supposed to.The best bits in fact come from Peter's unusual bachelors' night (that involves wine-tasting? Of all things?). When the situation arises that he's forced to take a road-trip all by himself to ensure that things are okay with Jess, he does hold up his end of the bargain. The scene at the gas-station, although too contrived, succeeds in generating a good number of laughs. But there's the obvious effort to make almost every other thing comedic (A carton-ful of diapers? Really?).In fact, the movie is filled with plenty of instances where the comedy feels like it's forcefully chucked in. Like the 'sexy- neighbors' segment (P.S - one of them is Demi Moore!). Like identifying the stripper by his manhood. Like gorging on pizza (like they've never had one before) after a cleaning up a murder-scene. So many. McKinnon, who plays an Australian woman (but constantly addressed 'Kiwi') is the one who manages to leave at least a marginal impression in this mess. Even if you're someone who has a weaker funny bone, 'Rough Night' feels like an opportunity missed. They could've done so much with the script than go for the uninteresting 'home-invasion' angle towards the climax and the 'everything is fine in the end for everyone' cliché.Verdict: Watch and delete from memory!",Rough Night

38,rockman182,Rough Night (2017),6,19 August 2017,"Ever since Bridesmaids the all female lead raunchy comedy has become a popular thing. Bridesmaid was a blast, funny throughout and sharp writing. Sadly, its predecessors such as The Bachelorette and Bad Moms miss the mark and aren't as good. With Rough Night I was hoping for something that would be memorable and a hell of a good time. While the film has some funny moments, they don't come as often as they should. I think the film could have been better but for it is its not bad.The film is about a group of friends who reunite for an upcoming wedding and a wild night of fun at a Bachelorette party. There's drinking, cocaine, and strippers involved. Until the aforementioned stripper falls and busts his head open and dies. Now the girls' happy night turns into one of terror and fear as they try to get rid of the body. The film is written by Lucia Aniello who is a primary writer on Broad City. It's also co-written by Paul W. Downs who also stars on the show. I've never seen Broad City but eh, the writing and jokes in this film don't really give me interest to do so.One of the weakest characters in the film was actually Ilana Glazer. That's a problem with this film, two of the bunch (Glazer and Zoe Kravitz) are bland. We already have a fairly straight laced main character in Scarlett Johansson so these two don't really come off as memorable. Jilian Bell was a bit much at times but she was a colorful character. I really like Kate McKinnon and she was responsible for some of the good humor in the film, however even she feels wasted in the film. There really aren't that many laugh out loud or even funny snicker moments.I'd say the second half of the film kind of collapses on itself. The first half was substantially stronger and then the more far-fetched and convoluted the scenario became, the more it suffered. Also the sub plot with Peter racing to Miami in a diaper doesn't always work. I liked the idea for the film but it needed more memorable characters and sharper writing to stand on its own. Its not entirely bad but it just feels like a film that's lacking and wasteful of its cast. I'll try Girls Trip when I get a chance and see if that gets the job done.6/10",Rough Night

42,dave-mcclain,"""Rough Night"" is creative, well-put together and, best of all, decadently and darkly diverting.",7,23 June 2017,"The bachelorette party comedy ""Rough Night"" (R, 1:41) brings together an element that Movie Fans rarely find on both sides of the camera – women. Well, women in prominent roles anyway. In 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", female characters had what were (for that era) relatively empowered roles, but the movie was still mainly about guys who were either pursuing girls or hanging out with their buds. Still, ""Fast Times"" was a bawdy comedy directed by a woman (Amy Heckerling) who, in the spirit of equality, shot full frontal female AND male nudity although the latter had to be edited out in order to avoid the box office-killing ""X"" rating (eight years before NC-17 became an option). The next big step forward for women in R-rated comedies came 17 years later with the first ""American Pie"" in which the female characters were as sexually savvy and empowered as the male characters on that big screen.Since the 21st century began, more such movies have shown us women operating on more-or-less equal footing with the men, sexually, socially and intellectually. Examples include, ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005), ""Knocked Up"" (2007), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008) (that one with more male than female nudity, thanks to Jason Segel's lack of inhibitions), ""Adventureland"" (2009) and, in 2011, ""Horrible Bosses"", ""Bad Teacher"" and, of course, ""Bridesmaids"", but all those movies were directed by men and written (mostly) by men, with the notable exception of that last one (thanks, Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo). However, despite the success of ""Bridesmaids"" at the box office and during the 2011-2012 awards season, the next six years only saw one R-rated comedy with women in vital roles both on screen and behind the scenes (2015's ""Sisters"", written by Paula Pell) until 2017. It has been a long wait for a ""Rough Night"".Scarlett Johansson is getting married! Well, her character Jess is anyway, so she's getting together with her four best friends from college for a bachelorette weekend in Miami. But things have changed a lot for (almost) all of them since the beer-pong and estrogen-fueled best years of their lives. Jess is a concerned citizen who is running for the state senate (!), Blair (Zoe Kravitz) and Frankie (Ilana Glazer) were a couple in college, but have grown apart – with Blair as a successful career woman who married (a man!) and Frankie as an unemployed semi-professional liberal activist. The person who has changed the least is the one who organized this getaway weekend, Alice (Jillian Bell), a lonely (and horny) elementary school teacher whose only real joy in life comes from being part of Jess' life. Alice is sure that she's Jess' best friend, until Pippa (Kate McKinnon), a friend from Jess' semester in Australia, arrives for the party.A night of drinking (which is somewhat awkward because of Alice's jealousy of Pippa) turns into a party at the ladies' borrowed glass house on the beach – and soon gets completely out of hand. The girls order a stripper and pizza. When a guy knocks on their door, the girls whisk him in and he starts dancing for them. The now-uptight Jess gets offended by his dirty talk, so the girls sit him in her chair and, after taking a running start, Alice jumps into the guy's lap. He falls backward, hits his head on the corner of the fireplace ledge – and dies! As the girls argue about what to do next, decide to move the body and then work on various ideas of how to get rid of it, they struggle to hide what has happened from their nosy, swinging neighbors (Demi Moore and Ty Burrell), someone walking their dog and several people who knock on the front door for various reasons. In the meantime, an upsetting interrupted phone call from Jess leads her fiancé (Paul W. Downs) to leave his (humorously lame) bachelor party and take, as one of his friends calls it, a ""sad astronaut"" road trip down to Miami to try and preserve his engagement.""Rough Night"" is creative, well-put together and, best of all, decadently and darkly diverting. The comparisons to movies like ""Bachelor Party"" (1984), ""Weekend at Bernie's"" (1989), ""Very Bad Things"" (1999), ""The Hangover"" (2009) and, of course, ""Bridesmaids"", are inevitable – and not unfair – but this one measures up well in their company. Its plot twists are its own and it's laugh-out-loud-funny, while speaking with a female voice. Director and co-writer, Lucia Aniello (making her first feature film), centers the action on the complicated and relatable relationships among these five women, while showing that they can be just as wild – and funny – as their male counterparts. Johannson herself isn't especially funny, but she plays uptight and (relatively) innocent very well, McKinnon effectively plays a down-under version of her typical loopy movie characters, Bell is as entertaining as ever, as she and Kravitz and Glazer give us a mix of drama and comedy that most of us haven't see from them before. Moore and Burrell are an unexpected treat as a randy and uninhibited couple and Downs is a revelation as the neurotic fiancé – and this film's co-writer! But even with all that, not to be written off as a ""chick flick"", the comedy ranges from scandalous situations to silly slapstick to salacious sight gags, all supporting a very good story. This movie is enjoyable enough to make anyone's rough night a little less rough. ""B+""",Rough Night

50,coreyjdenford,There's a Rough Night ahead of them,6,25 August 2017,"This review Rough Night is spoiler free*** (3/5)IN 2011 THE box-office smashing Oscar nominated adult comedy Bridesmaids cemented down a shiny new pathway for some seriously funny ladies to take over comedy, and for years after women have proved that they too can hit all the right marks with hilarious dialogue, a crude attitude and naughty behaviour which normally make a hit in male lead comedies.In writer-director Lucia Aniello's directorial debut Rough Night, seriously funny ladies lead a slew of penis jokes, nasty consequences, crude behaviour and a misjudged killing of a male stripper. When a group of friends reunite after ten years for a bachelorette party in Miami. There's Scarlett Johansson's Jess who is the bride to be, then there's Alice (Bell) she's the rudest of the group, next is Blair (Kravitz) who just joins in for the ride, fourth is Frankie (Glazer) who is the dopest of the group and finally there's Kate McKinnon's Pippa who's Jess' new friend from Australia. Its big name cast who give the film it's nails from their hilarious quips for which McKinnon is the standout through their party attitude to their consequences and it's here when the film shines. The group hire a male stripper, which bodes well for them for a while but when the worst happens they're brought closer together when it matters most.It's rude, beyond the constant penis jokes rude; it's rude in its shock tactics too these aren't just the quick and cheap shocks that lead other comedies, here they're carefully planned which gives this a polish, there's a penis gift bag, a BDSM room and there's a hilarious section with a jet ski. It's relentlessly funny in these moments which thrive thanks to Aniello's and Paul W. Downs' top notch screenplay. Sadly it's a typically flawed venture for these women, as it suffers in its characterization there are only a few lines of story between them, though each of them have problems, Jess is struggling to make senate, Blair is in a custody battle, then there's Alice who always feels betrayed. Rough Night isn't always funny either as there are a few jokes or shock tactics that fail to go beyond the planning. In addition it falls under a repetition strike too as some of the more shocking gimmicks play déjà vu particularly a body cover up sequence. However, despite this sudden drop this is still a still a seriously funny adult comedy which has carefully planned consequences and a funny big name cast.VERDICT: A seriously funny comedy led by some hilarious ladies who handle self-consciously naughty set-pieces with a flawed yet polished flare.",Rough Night

57,ginocox-206-336968,Unlikely BFFs share an unlikely evening,4,22 August 2017,"""Rough Night"" endeavors to be both saccharine sweet and raunchy, but fails to distinguish itself in either regard. In part, this seems to be a result of its genesis as the feature debut for a writer/director whose experience has primarily been limited to television. Much of the action occurs within a single room. At the conclusion, the characters have basically returned to where they were at the beginning, as they would in a sit-com. The dialogue is R-rated, as are some of the props, but the action is more PG. Many aspects seem contrived. Some characters are shocked and embarrassed when they walk in on a woman sunbathing topless. The actress in the role has bared her breasts in several of her better-known films, but is seen sunbathing with her hair coyly draped over her breasts. Who sunbathes with their hair covering their chest? Who would want the strange tan lines? Why take off your top, only to cover your breasts with your hair? The contrivance shatters the willful suspension of disbelief, reminding the audience that they are watching a movie that looks like a television show. Rather than take a flight that would arrive eleven hours later, one character chooses to drive, which would ordinarily be roughly a nine-hour trip, if he encounters no delays. But first, he must spend an hour making preparations for the trip. Naturally, he encounters a few delays, but still manages to make the trip in what seems like about three hours on the other end, arriving at a climactic moment. The trip becomes an unintended ticking clock, as the audience consciously or subconsciously doesn't expect anything to happen until the character arrives, which isn't expected for another nine hours, diminishing the sense of urgency at the other end. A McGuffin in a subplot is left unresolved until a post-credits scene, that answers the where, but raises questions as to the how and why not earlier that would require a whole second movie to explain. But it would also undermine the theme and moral, if the movie had them, as it becomes an unearned reward. In politically correct, liberal fashion, the movie involves two tightly-knit circles of friends from diverse backgrounds. But the characters don't seem to have enough in common to forge such enduring friendships. It seems realistic for straights to have friends who are homosexual, but for them to be tightly knit, there needs to be a strong basis of common interests. In two scenes, characters are offered illicit drugs and initially decline, but easily cave in to peer pressure. A character consumes a volume of energy drinks that would be lethally toxic. It isn't funny. The movie briefly exploits the burlesque physical comedy of intoxication, but loses sympathy for the characters. In the Hangover movies, Alan is an outsider, reluctantly accepted into the group because he is the brother of Stu's fiancée and the consumption of drugs is unintentional. A violent act is described as a ""good"" crime and doesn't have realistic consequences. Some visual gags are unrealistic. Characters purchase five cartons of a product when they can't possibly use more than one. An automotive mishap has consequences that would seem more appropriate in a cartoon. The movie doesn't have a strong or coherent moral or theme. It's not really a road trip movie, as everything happens at the destination, not en route. Five friends go out for a bachelorette party. There's no reason to set the action in Miami. We don't see any local color and it was actually filmed in Hermosa Beach, California. They squabble and disclose underlying tensions, but make up. They encounter some mishaps, but it doesn't really test their friendship. They don't seem to do anything they wouldn't do for casual acquaintances. Meanwhile, the fiancé and his group of friends spend their weekend of freedom behaving like henpecked effete castratos in scenes that may reflect how he hopes his fiancée is behaving, but doesn't mirror the action dramatically. Without actually testing their bonds, they endure mutual hardships and reaffirm the importance of friendship and family relations – or something like that. The movie offers a few laughs, but doesn't really push the envelope. The humor is neither cerebral nor burlesque, but something mired in the middle. Jillian Bell's Alice is incessantly needy and annoying. Ilana Glazer's Frankie seems stern and detached from the group. Kate McKinnon's Kiwi is brash and abrasive. Scarlett Johansson's Jess is tightly wound. It's difficult to understand why the characters like one another, much less why the audience should like them. Kudos for using rigid mounting systems for the cameras, one positive characteristic of television work, instead of the incessant kinetosis-inducing jigglycam shots in so many films.",Rough Night

59,trublu215,A Mildly Funny Film That's Been Done Before and Better,5,15 June 2017,"Let's be honest here...Rough Night is probably the most unoriginal idea to hit theaters this summer. It has the storyline of Peter Berg's 1998 film Very Bad Things with a Weekend at Bernie's twist. Starring Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Zoe Kravitz, the film's star power seems to have no shortage but the film's screenplay doesn't know what it wants to be. There are far too few thrills to classify it a thriller and, as far comedy is concerned, it is severely lacking. So we're given this cookie-cutter film that does its job (more or less). The film opens Hangover style, it introduces us to the gang of girls as they make their way to the bachelorette weekend to end all bachelorette weekends. Scarlett Johasson plays the bride to be while her bridesmaids are either overly sexual or prudes. There is not much of an in-between. No character felt real. They all felt like they were written specific to this event and that really didn't bode well with me. In a situational comedy like this, it helps to have a character we can relate to. This film really doesn't have a relateable character, just mere pawns in the film's game. The story itself moves pretty well through it's self proclaimed rough night but doesn't really latch on to you as a viewer. You're pretty much there to watch the ride...nothing else.The cast here is probably the best part of the film. Between the gravitas Johansson brings to the screen and the intrigue of Zoe Kravitz and the off the wall banter from Kate McKinnon, it would be a lie if I said they weren't at least fun to watch. The problem the film has is its dialog. If the film's goal wasn't to promote feminism and a pro-female image, I'd say it is passable. But the film portrays women either as sex-crazed drunkards or uptight prudes and coming off of Wonder Woman, this film seems like a slap in the face. Maybe it is poor timing or maybe it is true, only time will tell. Overall, the film isn't horrible. It features good performances from Kate McKinnon and Scarlett Johansson and makes the best of its boderline terrible script. It sustains its 101 minute runtime and fills them with countless penis jokes (Jillian Bell relies on them annoyingly too much) and features some decent moments of situational comedy that could have landed way better but they still land nonetheless. Either way, it is a passable film but not one that I'd recommend spending money to see in the theater.",Rough Night

The girls, of course, panic and decide to get rid of the body because if there is no body there is no crime. The death was an accident, but upon legal advise it is suggested they get rid of the body. I hope this was not called a comedy. This could have been funny. There was a lot to work with and there was nothing funny or clever in here. A lot of foul language, penis jokes, drinking and doing cocaine was what was going on and also the girls were getting on each others nerves.

See, there is more to the story. Problem remained that nothing was funny.

70,ReganRebecca,Just not that funny,5,23 June 2017,"I love TV show Broad City and was looking forward to this because two of the creatives behind that show paired up to give us Rough Night. The generic title (a switch from Move that Body which was much more suitable) should have warned me. Rough Night is forgettable and not really that funny. The movie starts out in 2006 where a group of 4 friends get drunk at Halloween, win a beer pong competition and vow to stay friends forever. Fast forward 10 years and the group is reuniting for Jess's (Scarlett Johansson, bland, bland, bland, comedy is NOT her forte) bachelorette weekend at a fancy house in Miami. They party, snort coke, are joined with Jess's Australian friend Pippa (Kate McKinnon in a role that MUST have been written for Rebel Wilson. Surely?). Her friends decide to get Jess a stripper and here is when things go wrong: high on coke they accidentally end up killing the stripper and things quickly spiral out of control as they first try to do the responsible thing of calling the police and then move on to hiding the body. There was minor protests before the film being released about the movie making a punchline of killing sex workers but the film could have overcome this and he gruesome premise if not for a few things. First of all the women lack friendship chemistry. I don't believe any of these women were ever friends even if a big part of it is that they are supposed to have drifted apart. Second the casting is all awful. Scarlett is not a comedy actress and neither is Zoe Kravitz and it shows. Without being backed up by her hilariously crafted Broad City alter ego Ilana Glazer comes across as simply annoying. Kate McKinnon and Jillian Bell are probably the best with their characters but neither one is given much to do. McKinnon just leans hard into her accent and Bell is saddled with a ""loser desperate friend who can't take a hint"". The third thing is that the movie never quite finds it's tone. It struggles between ""woke"" dialogue for characters who are actually just mean and instead of simply leaning into the fact that these women are awful and allowing them to get even more absurdly awful it's way too protective of the characters and keeps trying to redeem them by making them ""nice"" people. It's both incredibly boring and keeps the movie from really flying. Still, Rough Night isn't a total write off. There are enough funny lines and a subplot (involving Jess's fiancé who the movie allows to get into REALLY ridiculous shenanigans) to be watchable. Just wish that the script would have let the ladies turn loose too.",Rough Night

I hope a lot of wine snobs get to enjoy that slur against all things oenophile.There are some great lines and several laugh-out-loud moments, although not as many of the latter as I had hoped for. Things move at a rapid pace; there really is never a dull moment.Seeing Demi Moore and the guy from Arrow (Colton Haynes) made this movie all the more pleasurable.As one reviewer wrote previously: "" ""Don't take Granny.""

The jokes in this movie were all terrible and not funny. Don't understand what made Scarlett Johansson choose this movie. I did not find anybody's acting in this movie impressive. The ending of this movie was predictable and boring looks like there is going to be a sequel but I would suggest to wait on it make a good plot first then think about making sequel. Overall a really bad movie.My RecommendationNo I would not suggest anyone to watch this movie.My Rating0/10,Rough Night
77,Australian1,What the...?,3,23 August 2017,"What possessed Scarlet to be part of this awful movie? The one named Alice is foul mouthed, crass and not the least bit funny! Doesn't look any good either! The would be Australian is an insult not only to Aussies but to Kiwis as well! With so many good Australian female actors, you would think the producers/directors would have tried to convince one with the right accent to be in this movie! (Guess all Aussies had more sense!! If they tried to do something like the Hangover, it failed, if it was meant to be as funny as Weekend at Bernie's 1989, then it failed also. I still can't get over someone with the caliber of Scarlet to be part of this movie's cast. My advice is: Don't spoil the image you have of Scarlet Johansson. I gave it a 3 for the 3 funny segments. I don't think I spoiled anything, it did it by seeing the light of day!",Rough Night

79,makleen2,A Morally-Bankrupt Comedy,2,30 September 2017,"When Jessica ""Jess"" Thayer (Scarlett Johansson) decides to plan a wedding while running for state senate, she'll need a little help from her college friends, Alice (Jillian Bell), Frankie (Ilana Glazer), Blair (Zoë Kravitz), and Pippa (Kate McKinnon), to pull off a wild bachelorette party in Miami. Hilarity ensues when the ladies get drunk, snort a bunch of cocaine, and accidentally murder a male stripper, all while leading Jess' loyal fiancé, Peter (Paul W. Downs), to believe she wants to cancel the wedding. In the end, they get away Scott free because, well, I guess manslaughter isn't a thing in Florida. Comedy gold! Since the success of Bridesmaids (2011), there have been a slew of female-led comedies, but none have quite recaptured the magic of that film. Rough Night is something of a cross between Bridesmaids and The Hangover (2009), or a gender-swap of Very Bad Things (1998). It was written by partners Lucia Aniello and Paul W. Downs and directed by Aniello. Aniello, a former member of the improv troupe Upright Citizens Brigade, writes and produces Comedy Central's Broad City. This is her directorial debut. Ilana Glazer and Paul Downs also hail from Broad City.In Very Bad Things, a bachelor party in Las Vegas goes out of control when the drunk and coked up men (see a pattern?) accidentally kill a stripper and a hotel security guard. Roger Ebert said Very Bad Things, ""isn't a bad movie, just a reprehensible one. It presents as comedy things that are not amusing"" and assumes ""an audience has no moral limits and will laugh at cruelty simply to feel hip."" That's how I feel about Rough Night.I normally don't judge movies from a moral standpoint, because I realize people watch movies, especially comedies, to see situations and characters way outside the norm. It's escapism. But the more I think about Rough Night, the more morally adrift it seems. There are no consequences for anything that happens in the movie. Not only are there no consequences, but everyone's life actually improves in the end. Because it turns out the ""stripper"" was actually a bank robber, it helps Jess' campaign. Alice hooks up with the real stripper, and Frankie and Blair rekindle their college romance.The protagonist, Jess, really has no story arch. A minor conflict emerges between Jess and Alice, who has been unable to move beyond their college friendship, and is resolved fairly quickly. Early in the film, we see Jess' campaign manager explain how voters view her as stiff and uptight. Alice repeatedly takes pictures of them partying and posts the photos on social media. I thought the filmmakers were setting up a conclusion in which wild photos get leaked to the press and it (contrary to expectations) helps boost her image. Instead, the cocaine use, partying, and photos have no impact on anything whatsoever.I'm not sure why Scarlett Johansson, an A-List actress, signed up for a second or third-rate dark comedy. With an estimated net worth of $100 million, it's not like she needs the money. As the ""responsible"" member of the group, Johansson's character does little more than stand around, look hot, and act worried. It was a shame to see her talent go to waste.Paul Downs plays the completely emasculated groom, Peter, a henpecked husband-to-be. In a classic role-reversal, while his fiancé and friends are having a wild night in Miami, his friends are enjoying a wine tasting. After mistakenly hearing Jess call off the wedding over the phone, Peter decides to jump in his fuel-efficient car and drive down to Miami to win her back. His friends encourage him to go ""Lisa Nowak."" In 2007, Nowak drove 950 miles from Houston to Orlando allegedly wearing adult diapers to confront a romantic rival. Not only does Peter figuratively take on a female role, but he literally infantizes himself by wearing diapers. Peter's unnecessary humiliation adds nothing to the plot.Kate McKinnon (Saturday Night Live) is the one bright spot in the film. She plays Pippa, a woman Jess met while studying abroad for a semester in Australia. McKinnon really hams it up, but her charming, eccentric character delivers some of the few truly funny scenes.There are plenty of dark comedies that have successfully combined humor and serious, sometimes horrifying situations. The House of Yes (1997) and Super (2010) come to mind. Rough Night tries too hard to push the envelope, breaking the suspension of disbelief and straying into morally bankrupt territory in an effort to be ""edgy."" There's a point when increasingly outlandish behavior in a consequence-free environment crosses the line from comedy to parody. I'm not sure whether Rough Night is a comedy or a parody, but it fails at both.",Rough Night

82,2001ASOfan,Fans of R-rated gross-out comedies: Rejoice!,8,18 June 2017,"Stop reading right now if you find gross-out comedies repulsive and don't like legitimate, well-known actors doing disgusting things that could ruin you for seeing them in any more serious efforts in the future. I love seeing actors let their hair down and go for it in the spirit of having a good time themselves and (more importantly) making audiences laugh while doing so, and ""Rough Night"" is a very good example of exactly that. Everyone here clearly had a terrific time on set, I have no doubt some of the funniest dialogue was improvised, and that kind of free-spirited energy spills over for the benefit of any willing audience members who are there to go along for the ride and have a good time, too. Yes, the film could've used a quicker editing pace, does flag just a bit a few times, and cutting it to a 90-minute-ish running time would've likely made it an even tighter, funnier, zippier ride. But I mean to emphasize the most important thing: I laughed--a lot, and so did the audience around me. All of the main ensemble are a hoot, and one of the reasons I love this genre of comedy is discovering new talented comedians I didn't know before, usually in smaller supporting roles--here it's Paul W. Downs as a soon-to-be-married ""6"" (out of 10--the script's reasoning for his friends rating him a 6 are hilarious) who decides no one's going to stand him up at the altar. His efforts to fight back are easily one of the best running gags in the film. I'm a huge fan of Kate McKinnon's--sometimes just the way she facially reacts to other actors' lines can have me lost in belly laughs--and she's a standout here, but everyone genuinely pitches in and goes for it--and I love 'em for it! Good comedies are so rare these days, and I run to every one on opening weekend to pay to support them, hoping more will be made. Overall the mainstream multiplex movie fare leaves me wanting these days, and I hope all-out comedies, there for no other reason than to make us laugh and lighten our days, never go away.",Rough Night

85,Scarefish,Another Swing and a Miss In Female Comedy,1,9 August 2017,"I had a Rough Night seeing this film (Ba-dum, tsh!).It's a comedy but all of the jokes and gags I remember from it are ones that are well past their due date. Toilet humor, creepy swinger couple, STD jokes, bad fake accents, and the dumb selfish best friend that ruins the main character's life and acts like a hypocrite just to name a few. There's also much pop culture riddled throughout the film which will likely already date this film within the next couple years or so, such as when the film tries to make a jab at president Donald Trump by having a fictional political candidate who gets praise for posting dick pics to Twitter.Scarlet Johansen is the highlight of this film, which is faint praise considering what I think of her performances in Ghost in the Shell, Lucy, and Sing, and the character's friends are almost entirely intolerable and if this were reality she would be best off without them, but of course this movie has to be about how friends are the most important thing in the world even when they're self-centered alcoholics who literally get off with manslaughter. It's a minimum-effort dark comedy which fails to do both at the same time, which is quite important to do as the two tones literally clash with each other and the movie has to backpedal to try to remind you it's a comedy.YouTube comedy musician Bo Burnham also makes a minor appearance in this film, and he ends up being both more funny and charismatic than the actual male lead in the film despite his limited acting experience.There is very little in terms of plot in this film. It's Weekend at Bernie's with women instead of men. The movie ends with the cliché sort of happily ever after type ending, confirming the characters are all terrible people and having them gloat in being rewarded for it.This feels like a product made by machines and algorithms rather than actual human beings, and just perpetuates the stereotype that women are unfunny.",Rough Night

Their hard partying takes a hilariously dark turn when they accidentally kill a male stripper Jay (Papua New Guinea actor Ryan Cooper - Julia, Digital Physics). Amidst the craziness of trying to figure out what to do,their night takes some hilariously unexpected turns, ultimately bringing them closer together when it matters most.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Rough Night includes Paul W. Downs (Ghost Team) as Peter Jess' fiancé, American actor Ty Burrell (US TV Series Modern Family, Black Hawk Down) as Pietro, American actress Demi Moore (Disclosure, A Few Good Men) as Lea Pietro's wife, American actor Enrique Murciano (Black Hawk Down, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes) as Detective Ruiz, American actor Dean Winters (John Wick, US TV Series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) as Detective Frazier, American actor Colton Haynes (TV Series Arrow, San Andreas) as Real Scotty, Patrick Carlyle (The Wedding Ringer, Favor) as Patrick, Eric André (The Internship, Flock Of Dudes) as Jake, American actor Bo Burnham (The Big Sick, American Virgin) as Tobey, American actor Hasan Minhaj as Joe, Karan Soni (Deadpool, Office Christmas Party) as Raviv, Laura Grey (One Small Hitch) As Lisa, Mark Tallman as Malcolm, Caldwell Tidicue (Cherry Pop) as DJ (Club Liv), American actor Daniel Raymont (The Angriest Man In Brooklyn, BuzzKill) as Sommelier, American actor Madison Arnold (Escape From Alcatraz, Donnie Brasco) as Morty, Gina Cottone as Betty, Matty Blake (Hits, Calling It Quits) as State Trooper Gary, American actor Peter Grosz (US TV Series Veep, Slow Learners) as Cliff, American actor Devin Ratray (Home Alone films, Blue Ruin) as Bud, American actor Peter Francis James (True Story, The Messenger) as Jack Eason and American actor Brian Stack (Baby Mama) as Bob.Filming locations in Rough Night includes cities, places US States like Miami, Florida, New York, Southampton, New York, Hermosa Beach, California.Overall Rough Night is a good comedy film filled with comedy, funny moments, some violence, shooting, people partying, drinking, smoking, taking drugs, tongue and cheeks stuff, arguments, falling outs, friendship, family, catchy music with songs like I Touch Myself by Divinyls and The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson, beaches, the sea, discos, bars, nightclubs, some odd weird objects and things, swearing, some dodgy weird people and other things throughout the film.So I will give Rough Night an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Rough Night is worth seeing if you like comedy films like Girls Trip, Bad Moms, The Boss, Baywatch, Snatched, The House, Dirty Grandpa, Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates, Why Him? amongst others.So if you get the chance to see Rough Night in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",Rough Night

Towards the end the story becomes increasingly joyless, shovels in a terrible crime subplot and then forces out one of the most fake happy endings in recent memory (and my memory is good).Kate McKinnon is the only one who has some idea how to liven up the dull undertakings, and Jillian Bell certainly is right when she quips that she might be too much.",Rough Night

Few women get together to have a hen's night and call a male stripper to have some fun. And the man dies in an accident in the house and all women start the normal hysterical chaos. The story is about the stupid things they do to hide the body. Anyway in the end everything become normal and even the Police forgive them for the murder, like in a banana republic, and everybody lives happily thereafter! Now you know it is a terrible story – and I am telling you its terrible acting too! I had a lot of liking towards Scarlet up to yesterday but that's gone down by almost 50% now. One more movie she acts like this, then I will never watch her movies anymore! I really didn't know the other women actors much but am horrified even at the thought of seeing them again in my life for sure.

Jess is played by Scarlett Johansson (Lucy, Chef), who embarks upon a bachelorette party with friends Alice (Jillian Bell: 22 Jump Street, The Night Before), Blair (Zoe Kravitz: Divergent, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), Frankie (Ilana Glazer: Broad City, The Night Before) and Pippa (Kate McKinnon: Finding Dory, Ghostbusters) AKA Kiwi.When they get to the house where they are going to stay in Miami, they encounter neighbours Pietro (Ty Burrell: Dawn of the Dead, TVs Modern Family) and Lea (Demi Moore: Ghost, A Few Good Men) who seem overtly sexual and keen on Blair. After a night of partying, with drugs and alcohol, they go back to the house where Pippa orders pizza and Frankie decides to hire a male stripper, Jay (Ryan Cooper: Eye Candy, Confess) from Craigslist. When he arrives and stripteases for Jess, Alice wants to get in on the action so jumps on him causing his chair to fall over and him to bang his head violently on the fireplace behind. He is bleeding heavily and the girls freak out, giving half-hearted CPR, but he is dead. Panicking because the house is made of glass and the pizza guy has arrived, they hurry to hide the body.Meanwhile Jess' fiancé Peter is wine-tasting with his buddies and calls to see how Jess is doing, she blabs that something went wrong with the stripper, and in their panic to shut her up the girls grab the phone so Jess does not hear him ask if she still wants to get married. Frankie smashes the phone and Peter is left thinking that she does not want to marry him so decides to drive to Miami to win her back.Sadly this unoriginal movie (a bad remake of Very Bad Things with a smattering of Weekend at Bernie's) has a poor script, no plot, ridiculous antics of toilet humour, bad fake accents, swinger neighbours, STDs to name but a few, and just plain predictability, because yes, my friend's and I spent most of the movie correctly predicting what would happen next - the only thing we didn't get right was Pippa's 'story arc' as she didn't have one and quite frankly, we could not see the point of her character at all. We even wondered if she had written it, but it turns out the guy who played the fiancé had.There was zero chemistry between any of the cast and the acting was not up to much, mostly overacting to be honest, and certainly not the calibre for a good comedy. You just don't care about any of the characters and the highlight for us was when my friend recognised Colton Hayes (Teen Wolf, TVs Arrow) as Real Scotty.There were a couple of laughs in among and for a night where you wish to talk and drink and have a movie on in the background, this would be great.

Nah, mate!",2,30 December 2019,"I was really looking forward to this movie, but first thing's first:Why did the casting directors give an Australian role to an American instead of, say, an actual Australian accent who has a legit Australian accent? I love Kate McKinnon; she's incredibly funny! Apart from the humour aspect that she brought to this movie, she's not suited to such a role. Her Australian accent was, in all honesty, horrible! Granted, the Australian accent is hard to replicate and while Americans do their best attempt, they just don't quite... even come close to nailing it! There are many Australian actresses they could've cast in this role and been just as funny. The first example is Rebel Wilson. Second comes Margot Robbie. Tammin Sursok, Abbie Cornish, Teresa Palmer (I'm not sure if she's in the US, or just Australia), Samara Weaving, Isabel Lucas, Ruby Rose...Now, onto other matters...The acting was... okay, but the characters were really self-centred and the plot didn't really make sense. Why would they not call at least the ambulance, if not the cops? Of course, the cops would be called, but at least this would be viewed for what it is: an accident, and they did the right thing. But no, for the sake for comedy, they mustn't call the cops. It's just illogical!Other than that, the movie's not too bad, but still rather cringeworthy and predictable with a few cheap laughs.Would I watch this again? Probably not.

SHOCKING!!!,4,21 August 2017,"Good to see the studios finally listening to what people want, and making daring, creative, unique movies COMPLETELY UNLIKE anything we've seen before!!! SIKE! It's not a perfect world, and unfortunately, movies are stupidly expensive to make, and the investors and decision makers generally play it safe and green-lite whatever script seems the least risky.It's hard to blame them really. A person's got to sleep at night! So, sadly, the studios would rather churn out sequels and remakes of anything that made a lot of money in the past. Then paste in the currently hottest stars, and rest easy with a reliable profit projection based on a bunch of data.It's MATH people! The Hangover + Kate McKinnon + Scarlett Johansson = $And as an added bonus, top critics will be scared to give it a bad review for fear of being labelled ""SEXIST""! How can we loose!!$!$!! OK, with that little rant out of the way, I guess I'll move on to ranting about how the film lacks a single original idea! It starts out feeling like a carbon copy of ""The Hangover."" Remember in ""The Hangover"" when the timeline suddenly jumps to the next day and the hotel room is trashed and the guys embark on a fun, mysterious adventure to piece things together?! Well, something like that was too clever for this movie, so instead it just turns into the movie ""Very Bad Things"" combined with a bunch of other crap that seems familiar and lazy.The characters are mostly boring, poorly developed, and worst of all, they all feel somewhat forced. You know that epic swagger and confidence that Scarlett Johansson exhibits in the MARVEL films? None of that here. She seems slightly awkward and uncomfortable in this role, and a little unsure of who her character is supposed to be exactly.I was about to throw in the towel and admit defeat 10 minutes in, when thankfully Kate McKinnon shows up and quickly seems to be the only excuse I can think of to keep watching.It's not really that the movie is that bad, it's more just that it's not that good, and not that funny. It's a shame to see a very talented cast, that seems slightly un-inspired by the material and characters they are playing, and the group's chemistry was lacking. I was having a hard time relating to a single character, and I definitely did not believe that they were actually BEST friends with each other. All that being said, the movie does have some funny moments, and is pretty well made overall. I started skipped ahead a little in the second half because I was getting bored, but that's most likely due partially to my self-diagnosed ADHD! I almost started feeling generous and gave it 5 stars when Kate McKinnon sings her song during the credits, that was pretty hilarious actually. Unfortunately, the script is pretty lazy and a lot of the dialog is bland and UN-inspired.A Movie like this will NEVER be GREAT! It will never make a TON of money or stand the test of time. But it's also highly unlikely to fail and loose money, so this is what we get. So I guess I'll add one last memo to Hollywood... ""TAKE SOME RISKS ONCE IN A WHILE, PLEASE!!!"" I know, I know, they are too busy spending that remake cash on strippers and blow to have any chance of noticing this. That and the don't care :) So if this looks like the type of movie you would like, you probably will enjoy it. All others may want to steer clear. The real issue is the over saturation of these types of films coming out of Hollywood. It's a pretty decent, while forgettable comedy, but it's hard not to imagine what other, way cooler movie that this money could have gone towards instead...",Rough Night

It's cute, crass, and a little unexpected.",7,25 September 2017,"This movie didn't get the greatest user reviews—and they gave away too much in the trailer, which can often lead to a let-down (if you haven't seen the trailer then I recommend skipping it)—but when I saw some of the critics had been kinder, I decided to give it a whirl. I wanted to like it, given the cast and writer/director. A word of advice: don't go into this thinking it's just a female version of the hangover. It's a different animal. The beginning is a little slow, not many laughs actually the first scene that made me laugh out loud involved the boyfriend, not the bride-to-be. I almost gave up on the film then, but the movie started getting better (and it kept getting better). I did find one of the characters to be dull/annoying but that didn't kill the film for me. Dialogue isn't the best but there are fun elements to the plot. I don't want to give anything away.Despite a traditional madcap/""things go wrong"" premise, it's actually a quieter filmbut that doesn't mean it isn't good or funny in its own way. If you do decide to give this one a try, I recommend you watch till the very, very, very end. No, it's not a mind-blowing, must-see filmyes, there is a gratuitous vomit scene (just once I'd love to see a new comedy confident enough to NOT have one) but if you're in the right mood, this funny little film could be just the thing.",Rough Night

103,Sophie_KN_66615,0 out of 10 is too generous,1,13 March 2019,"I cannot express in words how important it is that you do NOT waste your time watching this movie! I'm not a fan of Scarlett Johansson but I thought I'd give her one last try....the only positive thing to come out of this movie is confirmation of how utterly awful she is at acting. Really awful.
This movie was done years previously with Very Bad Things where a bunch of friends accidentally kill a stripper at the guys bachelor party. The only difference is that in that movie, it was done very, very well and was an amazing movie. Why they would try to recreate that in the first place is beyond me but then to produce this utter pile of garbage and try to pass it off as a good movie, almost makes you want to quit Hollywood!
The story was obviously recycled. The characters are all annoying. There is a waste of some potential talent in this movie and what the hell is up with Demi Moore's weird cameo?! The entire scene with the fiance in the diaper, it was so stupid that it was embarrassing to watch. This movie is awful!!!",Rough Night
104,lazygafiltafish,Wow the reviews here are a bit harsh lol,5,26 April 2020,"Is this a really good comedy? No, but it's just a fun, lighthearted move to watch for 90 minutes. Everything was predictable, but I still enjoyed myself. I actually enjoyed this more than Bridesmaids which I didn't think was that good. This a cross between that and Weekend at Bernies. Kate McKinnan imo was good in this movie, but hard to watch in The Spy Who Dumped me (similar to Rough Night...not a particularly good comedy, but fun to watch once). I'll admit I'm surprised ScarJo did this movie since she seems to mainly do high brow dramas, but she was good in this (although the movie really is an ensemble cast more than anything else). I think she may have just wanted a comedy since she normally doesn't go for these.My favorite parts? ScarJo's fiance at the gas station was probably the best scene in the movie. Demi Moore and the dad from Modern Family (hate the show, but I love the actor) have a small role in this, but their scenes are great too as a sexually charged middle aged couple.",Rough Night
105,hp-33729,Garbage,2,26 September 2017,"Let's not beat around the bush -- this movie is pure garbage. There are some other reviews saying it's a decent comedy, but don't be fooled -- that's only because Hollywood's been pumping out terrible comedies for so long that people are starting to get used to them. This seems to be the new normal, apparently. This is what we should expect from a comedy these days. So disappointing.To be fair, the story of the movie is actually decent, and they could have gotten something hilarious out of it if they really tried. The premise certainly has a ton of potential for slapstick and funny situations. Unfortunately the writers weren't creative enough, and even though there are a few mildly entertaining jokes here and there, you can just feel that they had a really hard time filling those 100 minutes with anything interesting.Most jokes simply don't land due to terrible acting and comedic timing, and many are just tasteless, awkward and cringe worthy, like the entire road trip subplot and the gas station scene. I understand humor is subjective, but in what universe is that supposed to be funny? None of the characters are likable, and the actors clearly didn't have any decent material to work with. I honestly don't understand what Scarlett Johansson is doing in this movie and Paul W. Downs aka the diapers guy should never work again as an actor after accepting a role like this. What were they thinking? I did enjoy Kate McKinnon's overacting with that crazy accent though, she's the only one that made this movie barely tolerable.Ultimately Rough Night a boring, empty and mostly cringe inducing piece of garbage trying to cash in on the success of the Hangover franchise, but it's not working because the creators clearly missed the point.",Rough Night

Then 10 years later, they all have different lives but one friend is holding on to the ""glory days"" way too tight. Then the left turn is when they kill the stripper and all the way they make it worst. I got to say, if the movie was with a bunch of teenagers I would understand a little more but a group over 30 should really know better.

Like everyone of these films its about drink, drugs and sex. The plot is fairly irrelevant, but basically a state senator is getting married so she has a hen weekend. They kill a stripper with the big clumsy one jumping on him and naturally this leads to them calling the police...oh wait no this leads to them trying to dispose of the body themselves.

Sadly that did not happen with this movie. I only laughed maybe a handful of times through the whole movie, & more-so in the last 1/3 of the movie. The first 2/3 of the film was almost unbearable. The character of Alice made me want to hit her many times, there was nothing funny about her, she was a pathetic, needy, jealous control freak.

118,TwentyWasHere,"Like man of its jokes, the movie dies...",2,12 November 2017,"""Rough Night"" is simply not funny. It seems typical for the recent all female comedies: casting only women for a comedy doesn't make it automatically funny. You still need good jokes.The ones is this one are recycled jokes from far better movies, the usual ""off beat"" punchline timing, repeating stupid statement multiple times in a row and so on. You know, all the stuff that made comedies of the last few years unfunny like in no decade before. There is not a single good laugh in this movie.The general idea about a comedy that basically reverses the setting of ""Very Bad Things"" to an all female group is quite genius. It could have been such a great dark comedy if they followed through with the idea and actually made it a dark comedy. But they abandon that potential very quickly.You get one not funny scene after another, every joke dies during delivery, no punchline of a joke is timed correctly. Being a female comedian these days must be painful if that is the best the studios have to offer.The actresses do a good job, but this wreck of a humorless script is not salvageable. The movie tries to pull audience into the theaters by the all-female-cast gimmick but had nothing funny to offer.2 out of 10.

Judging by the other reviews I'm not sure if they landed with anyone else either. There were funny moments to be fair, but they are few and far inbetween.Overall this movie seems like a slick attempt to profit off of Scarlet's good name and acting credentials, but she doesn't really do this role any justice.

Imitating the worst behavior of the worst men does absolutely nothing to advance the position of women in society.ROUGH NIGHT is nothing but one long, tedious cliché'. The bachelorette party with the dead stripper? It's been done so many times it's nauseating. It was sexist when it was about a bachelor party ending up with a dead hooker, it's sexist when the shoes are put on the opposite feet. It's not amusing, it's not entertaining.

153,tootyfnfruity,Female comedy appears to be hopeless.,1,9 August 2020,"Not only does this movie lack humor of any form, it's a rip-off of at least three other movies - The Hangover, Very Bad Things, and Bridesmaids.
Being that Bridesmaids in itself is a rip-off of The Hangover and this movie does a rip-off of the rip-off while ripping off the original material is just sad.
Did I mention it's not funny at all. It tries so hard to be too. It forces bad jokes down your throat over and over that I felt sick. Just terrible. Female comedy has to ride the coattails of male comedy, very blatantly, on a constant basis. It's a very depressing thing to witness. I don't know if it's an example of just how far our country has been dumbed down (because some people actually like this, apparently) and Hollywood is cashing in on it, or if it's just that they honestly can't come up with fresh material. It's sad, but what's even sadder is that this same stuff is happening in the horror genre.",Rough Night
154,indiaodonohoe,This film is underrated.,7,31 August 2019,"There are loads of negative reviews on this film so I'm here to give a slightly more positive one.I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, entertaining, and the plot was not too predictable. Also, the acting was very impressive.I watched this on a saturday night, and it made my evening very enjoyable. It's not supposed to be an intellectually challenging film, it's supposed to make you laugh. And it made me laugh a lot. The jokes were well played out, and the main characters were phenomenally acted, and sure- some of the jokes were immature and childish but that was part of the charm of this movie.Based off of all of the other reviews I had read before watching I was expecting a really mundane film and it wasn't. The plot line was interesting, and even though there were one or two serious scenes I was still very much hooked on what was going on.This film made me properly laugh out loud, and I really did enjoy it. Sure it wasn't incredible cinematography, and it didn't leave me thinking about the meaning of existence like many of Johanssons more notable films, but it was very enjoyable, and I would watch it again with friends.
In fact, this film for me was even with how much I enjoyed bridesmaids, and maybe it's because I love Kate McKinnon and Scarlett Johansson, but I still think that despite the negative reviews this film deserves more love as the laid back comedy it is.",Rough Night

156,rach_8122,Rough time watching this!,1,27 June 2017,Not sure why people are rating this so high. They try way too hard to make it funny. It was predictable...characters were stereotypes and there were weird long pauses after 'jokes' I guess for the audience to laugh? Which not many did. There was a scene in the trailer that wasn't even in the movie?!! Like what the? I wonder if they spent most of their budget getting Scar J or she owed someone a massive favor!,Rough Night

Sure the actors in it are good but we already know they are good. You wouldn't give Rachel Weisz 5 stars for a commercial for tampons no matter how much it seemed like she was on her period. This movie deserves less than a single star - no disrespect for the actors - OK maybe a little disrespect because while I know it is expensive to heat a pool couldn't you make just as much money doing a commercial in Japan for Super Fantastic Fun Time Energy Drink (you'll say two words in Japanese, smile and give a thumbs up)?

168,nater3000,Surprisingly fun if you go in with an open mind!,8,22 June 2017,"My fiancée doesn't really like movies; she gets a bit anxious and fidgety, so she gets up and walks around when we're watching at home. For the first time, she actually said we could go to the movie theater if we saw Rough Night. The trailer had looked alright, so I agreed, just excited that she would actually go to a movie theater with me. She didn't leave her seat once. The movie Rough Night seems like it shouldn't work. Scarlett Johansson isn't necessarily known for her comedic chops, the premise of a bachelorette party gone wrong is a little cliché, and Broad City, while funny, isn't necessarily a worldwide phenomenon that appeals to everyone. And yet I sat through the whole movie anxiously waiting to see how the hell he group of amazingly talented and hilarious women would get out of the situations they're in. The plot is a little cliché, reminiscent of Weekend at Bernie's and The Hangover, but with a few unique changes that make it just new enough to be worth making. I was surprised at how many times is as sitting through the movie chuckling to myself even while nobody else was. I love all the little cameos in the including Bo Burnham, Eric Andre, Ty Burrell, and Demi Moore. They were all individually really good and worth watching. I was also floored by the main Bachelorette party. Each individual member has moments of absolutely insanity and hilarity, including Kate McKinnon, showing us, almost annoyingly that she is a character actor to be reckoned with. All in all, I really really loved this movie. I think it deserves better than the 5.5 it has at the time of my review, but I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Ghostbusters (2016) didn't, and that's also a shame, but in my honest opinion, anybody who thinks women can't be funny in plot driven movies needs to watch this and Ghostbusters; I can guarantee they will be proved wrong. Don't expect The Godfather; don't forgo in looking for a genius plot. Just sit back, relax, and have a fun time. It's worth it.",Rough Night
169,fatrat-70816,Rip Off,1,9 December 2020,"So this movie is a rip off of Very Bad Things. The main difference is that the roles have been switched from men to women a la the 2016 Ghostbusters flop - and it also stars the extremely annoying and unfunny Kate McKinnon. It seems like it is going for a bit more over-the-top comedic performances rather than the dark and ironic comedy of the original. I would definitely recommend watching Very Bad Things first if possible. Or ,go back and watch it if you have unfortunately seen Rough Night first and see how it is the better film.",Rough Night

None of the characters had chemistry and I wasn't convinced that any of them would have been friends in college or afterwards... And there were moments that had me thinking ""okay maybe this is going somewhere"" but I was disappointed each and every time..nothing was funny about this filmand I honestly mean nothing! And am I the only one who noticed how awkward the male gigilo seemed when he met them during their pathetic excuse for a party? The actor looked like he took on the role because he needed the money.. If you ask me.. He's the lucky one for getting killed off so early in the film.. And the whole threesome with Demi Moore and Zoe Kravitz was just shameful! If this film exemplifies the future of Demi Moore's career than maybe it's time to retire. To say this movie sucks isn't doing it justice, maybe if it been a horror movie or a suspence it could have had a chance.. But instead it's just another bad movie.. Maybe if anybody in the cast is lucky this film will be forgotten.. I'm ok with pretending I didn't see it",Rough Night

Even some jokes in this movie were not really funny. It was a bit of a pity or forcing a viewer to laugh. Cano boys can be envelopes of little girls and especially the owners of Peter. The film was very predictable. Even in some scenes I felt bored and confused. it is proved that Scarlett Johansson is not worthy of comedy but really worthy of scenes of action and fighting, but comedy can not perform. The scenes of laughter and pretense were exaggerated that you wanted to laugh but you did not. The yelling and the loud voice of the girls was not convincing and it was clear that he was represented.

The rest are either plan dumb or one's that need to talk less. The worst of them all is Scarlett Johansson's finance played by Paul W. Downs. The entire time I was thinking there's no one someone pretty like her would marry a weirdo like him. No chemistry, just gross. The movie does have some funny parts including when the stripper gets killed but then it drags on the rest of the way. One part of the film features Demi Moore and Ty Burrell who play the creepy neighbors in which this was not necessary at all to the story.

The plot is very light and totally unbelievable but exists as a means to allow the girls to get up to ""hijinks"".The fact that one of the ""big reveals"" only happens in the end credits shows just how little the plot matters in this film. I only really watched it because of the direct comparison with ""Girls Trip"", the two movies start out more or less the same but in the end Girls Trip makes this look like a school play, written and acted by inexperienced children. Its a shame because had there not been a similar movie this might have scored higher. Grab some popcorn and have a giggle, don't bother turning off your phone, you wont miss much if you get distracted by Facebook or Twitter.",Rough Night

218,mailphoenix,So much cringe,4,21 May 2019,"This is so bad, yet I am open minded and can see how fun it was for the actors to make. Drugs, booze and accidentally killing a Craigslist stripper/prostitute. The acting is so absurd. I want beo in their world",Rough Night
219,dfmiranda1,Don't waste your time,1,15 December 2018,I barely could watch half of it. Anything but funny. The movie is so irritating. Bad jokes and there is no chemistry between the actresses.,Rough Night
220,mmbeimler,I didn't want to like it...,7,15 September 2017,"...but I did. I'm personally very skeptical of all comedies (and usually roll my eyes more than laugh) but this one was ridiculous in a great way. The jokes were less predictable than most comedies, the mocking tone of so many of the scenes was hilarious, and the quick but dirty jokes left me entertained without being annoyed. Also, the acting was good enough not to distract from the plot. If you are in the mood for something logical, stay far away from this one. If you are in the mood for a ridiculous comedy then this should do the trick. I won't recommend this to everyone I know, but I have a short list of friends that will definitely be amused by this movie.",Rough Night
221,borgefagerli,It's just not funny,2,7 September 2017,"OK, so the plot of the movie is somewhat familiar for those who remember Weekend at Bernie's from back in the 80s. The problem is that WAB was funny, but this just isn't funny. Some poor slapstick here and there, but the lines are just awkward and completely unfunny, and often goes into tangents that would be funny if they actually had a point - but they don't. I'm a fan of Scarlett Johansson, and she's the reason I rated this 2 stars instead of 1 - but even an actress of her caliber couldn't manage to dig this movie out of its misery. I'm even surprised she took the lead role in the first place. My wife and I stopped the movie with 30mins left, figuring that that last half hour was time we would never got back if we sat through to the end.",Rough Night
222,laurajaneagosta,Don't bother!,2,4 January 2020,"Some momentary laughs (or smiles, really) but overall, a bad and predictable storyline. If you want an Australian character, get an Australian actor. The accent was awful and the stereotypical character was offensive.Save your time and watch something else!",Rough Night
223,wofleren,Waste Of Time,1,15 April 2018,"Bad script, extreme thin plot, stupid dialog, boring characters and just no humor at all. This is at least in my top 5 of the worst movie I have seen - maybe event top 3.
Not even Scarlett Johansson can drag this movie out of its indifference. And for the first time ever Kate McKinnon isnt funny - Thats how bad, boring and time-wasting this movie is. Enjoy!",Rough Night

225,roelandvandenberg,The Hangover remake/copy rip-off,5,2 July 2017,"The Hangover remake/copy rip-offBut then with an all girls line-up.I think this movie is not made to entertain or to give a quality product rather then cash in , nowadays this happens a lot and here we see not a star cast of actor nor with a comedy talent in this flick, they just managed to get one star actor,(which is miss matched for this type-pa role) contrary to the Ghostbusters movie , which had a comical group of star actor right for the role, this one how ever as being the girl hangover movie is still okay for people who eat movies for breakfast by the dozen .",Rough Night
226,jenny-195-743585,Should get better ratings,7,14 April 2019,Smart and funny. It would probably get better ratings if it were a male cast and a male perspective. Definitely in the same class as The Hangover.,Rough Night
227,masonjames97,"Same as every other comedy ""enhanced"" movie out there",2,17 June 2017,"Has anyone else noticed the constant similarities between comedy films in the past 10 years? Well, I have, and it is getting old. The beginning of these particular films start off with drugs and/or old friends meeting up with each other, but then something bad happens, they get into a fight, there's a bad guy or two, then they all live at the end, happily ever after. It's a total joke and a waste of money, but I do have to say that there were a few times I laughed, and a few times where I just stared blankly at the screen thinking to myself, ""How much money does Sony like to take from people,"" because you know that the person who walks into a movie theater is compelled by the movie they are wanting to see, but leaves feeling sad that they just wasted 15 dollars or more on a ticket, because I know the feeling, and I got that certain feeling after seeing this movie.",Rough Night
228,gmac-43455,The very worst of the year so far.....,2,9 September 2017,"This film was loathsome. I could spend 10,000 words ranting on but here's just a few reasons why I detest it so much:1. It's jokes are written for idiots. When a champagne cork pops and all the other airport passengers hit the deck I get the joke. I don't need the characters to say 'that sounded like a gunshot and we're in an airport, DERP!'2. The whole diaper sub-plot. This thing contrives the most idiotic reason for the fiancée character to race to the rescue wearing an adult diaper. Then it doesn't even bother to try and stick to that logic. It's obvious they just thought 'wouldn't it be hilarious if this character wears a nappy for half the film?' Nope.3. Speaking of the fiancée - what a charisma-free, unfunny little midget he was. And he co-wrote it? Epic double-fail!4. The sex-perv neighbours. Just staggeringly unfunny. Plus their part in the story is completely redundant and just dead-ends.5. Kate McKinnon. Another horrible, wildly overacted performance from her. More proof that she sucks. And why the Australian accent? Oh because funny, right??6. Jillian Bell. I had never heard of a Jillian Bell before this thing, never knew what it was. Now that I've experienced it, I never want to encounter another Jillian Bell in any other film ever. Probably doesn't help that her character is so detestable, selfish and just plain horrible. She deserves to end the film in a cell awaiting a long prison sentence. So yeah movie let's instead end with 2 cute guys fighting for her affections. Cos girls who look like George from Rainbow are just catnip right??7. The ending. It's laughable that this film tries to portray itself as edgy and shocking when it has one of the safest cop-out endings you'll ever see. These characters are guilty of manslaughter and attempting to dispose of a body, things don't deserve to end well for them. So what does the movie do? Contrive the most pathetic reason for them to get off with all their crimes and end the film with them all happy and smiling, their bonds of friendship renewed. They are totally unfazed by all that's occurred. Nothing like a bit of consequence free manslaughter to bring people closer together!8. No laughs. There are literally no laughs. Not one.Throw in the slo-mo shots walking down the street, the dancing, the WOO-HOOing and you have the single worst film of the year so far. Over to you Kevin Hart.....",Rough Night

230,aloveday-16904,Terrible,2,2 September 2017,Some momentary chuckles were the highlight.For goodness sake get an Australian actress next time you want an Aussie accent. Wasn't even close and then she only kept it for about 2 lines.Don't spend money on this,Rough Night

233,irina-94020,Totally waste of time and money. Stupid humor is throughout.,1,24 June 2017,"I can honestly say that I DID NOT enjoy one single plot or element of this movie. The whole point of it was that people can get away with murder and live happily ever after. Our societal degradation is to the point where someone's death (even accidental) is considered to be funny and humorous. Very disappointing and disturbing message of the main story. Even though I normally like actresses like Scarlett Johansson and Kate McKinnon, I was surprised that they were agreed to be part of this protrusion of stupidity that does not spike the humor but instead disgust.",Rough Night

This movie tries to copy that but from a women's perspective and like most other remakes/cheap copies it fails. It's a movie for kids under 16. It's clear that Hollywood is changing and the women are in control there because we ca all see this avalanche of feminist movies (Wonder Woman, Ghostbusters (2016), Atomic Blonde etc) and these stupid movies that are only intended to give feminist icons a job",Rough Night

How much this was to do with it being the finale to a long hot bank holiday weekend i don't know but to me seriously stupid escapism and very funny with just the right amount of unsubtle pathos emanating largely from Alice's lack of self awareness! I salute the crew and the cast. Thank you for an enjoyable evening's entertainment.",Rough Night

I swear the way these girls think, react to situations they cause, their reasoning, logic,etc. it's so true to see this is the way of our future and what is going to decide how we move forward. Not to mention the one girl becomes mayor. I know it's just a movie but sad and true it's not to far off the way Hollywood, our government and the people of America are. This should be played instead of national anthem and it's a blessing that all the great medical marijuana, so educated wasted sperm cells in California don't get enough credit. People wonder why we are over ran by illegal immigrants. It's not hard to over take a bunch of spoiled, over paid, entitled, steroid, plastic surgery, given not gifted, never worked for anything and worthless people. Not hard to come in and take a bunch of retareded fools over. We need to start euthanizing people instead of animals. Mankind is infected and it's a easy fix. Even from Adam and Eve. We were shown how women are manipulating evil and we Still let it happen.",Rough Night
