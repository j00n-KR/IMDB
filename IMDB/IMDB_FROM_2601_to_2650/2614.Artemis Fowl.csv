0,TheLittleSongbird,Artemis Fail,2,13 July 2020,"It's actually been a long time since reading the book series, but from retrospect they were certainly better than this film version. Love Disney and Disney+ has been a godsend recently and watched regularly actually, one of many reasons as to why my reviewing here has slowed down. Kenneth Branagh is a gifted director, absolutely love his Shakespeare adaptations with 'Much Ado About Nothing' being a personal favourite (though others will prefer the also great 'Hamlet' and 'Henry V'). Love Judi Dench as an actress too.'Artemis Fowl' was a real disappointment. As an adaptation it's an abomination, one of the worst book to film adaptations there is in existence. Am not kidding here. It fares even worse on its own terms, despite what those that have defended the film say some that have hated the film have not read the books and saw it as fans of Branagh and Dench, my parents being among those people. Almost nothing works and Branagh has never been this uninterested in his directing in what is easily his worst film (those that disliked 'Murder on the Orient Express', didn't care for that myself while not hating it, will appreciate that film better after seeing this).The least bad asset is actually the music score, which is actually beautiful to listen to, authentically Irish and lilting. Sadly it was one of those scores that were pleasant enough on their own but failed to fit within the film, this score sounded like it belonged somewhere else. The scenery also wasn't bad in parts but the photography generally is rushed looking and some of the images thanks to some very disjointed editing and garish lighting are quite ugly so that was wasted too. Any special effects are afterthought-looking.Moving on further onto the criticisms, the acting is really not good. Ferdia Shaw is monotone and charisma-free throughout. Lara McDonnell has more perkiness but the character is very underwritten and bland on the whole. Colin Farrell is completely wasted. Josh Gad tries too hard is gets very annoying after a while, actually thought he didn't blend very well with everything else. You know something is wrong when Dench gives the least bad performance and still manages to give one of her worst performances, that affected accent and voice was not needed and she doesn't look engaged at times. At least she showed some signs of having command over her meagre material.Branagh was clearly not interested in the material, as his direction throughout is uncharacteristically indifferent and phoned in. One would not think that he is a great Shakespearean director, and he did prove with his wonderful 'Cinderella' that he could do non-Shakespeare too, as this is quite inept. The target audience also felt confused, my mother was very unsure at who 'Artemis Fowl' was aimed at, children will find it hard to follow and it is too dull for adults. Even teens, the main target audience of the book series, will question the target audience.Script is stilted and is too exposition-heavy (apparent right from the beginning with an over-explanatory narration), a lot of the film screeching to a deadening halt in the more talky sections and there are a lot of those. The storytelling is incredibly thin and not does it feel like a hodge podge of cobbled togther ideas it is all executed in a dull fashion and with little coherence, literally only one event happens. There is one action show-piece pretty much with a troll very late on but even that doesn't thrill and even the troll doesn't look that good. There is no character development whatsoever, nobody is given time to breathe, the villain is a non-entity and Artemis himself is practically useless. What little there is of the action is sluggish, incoherently edited and the sense of danger just isn't there. To cap it all off, the ending was a completely abrupt anti-climax.In summary, very poor. 2/10",Artemis Fowl
1,SnoopyStyle,arrogant lead and flat magic,5,24 June 2020,"The media circus descends upon Fowl Manor in Ireland. Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad) gets arrested and interrogated by MI6. He recounts the story of the Aculos. There is magic in the world and Artemis Fowl is his name. His father (Colin Farrell) has been kidnapped as evil forces search for the Aculos. There is a secret underworld of magical creatures. A fairy police officer named Holly Short is trying to clear her father's name who stole the Aculous. Her superior officer Commander Julius Root (Judi Dench) heads the effort to retrieve the powerful magical artifact.The lead kid is too arrogant and too annoying to be the rooting interest. I like Holly Short better and her opening scene with Josh Gad is actually fun. The magical underworld is a cross between near futurism and steam punk. I like the premise but some of the execution is less than magical. From the MIB suits to the derivative take on Irish magic, this movie lacks the imagination needed to elevate it. At the very least, someone should explain the Aculous at the beginning. All in all, this seems to be a fine fantasy premise but director Kenneth Branagh fails to pull a compelling movie out of the material.",Artemis Fowl
2,Prismark10,Artemis Fowl,4,23 July 2020,"Writer Eoin Colfer noted some years ago that the film version of his Artemis Fowl books has been stuck in development hell. The producers even a cast a young boy as Artemis Fowl, a role he never got to play. Colfer said he still sees him around and he is now a grown man.Disney hired Kenneth Branagh as director to bring the film to the big screen. After all he appeared as a villain in one of the Harry Potter films and directed the first Thor movie for Marvel. Instead the film has gone to Disney' streaming channel.Young Artemis Fowl is a 12-year-old Irish genius who needs to rescue his father who has been taken by a fairy. His wealthy father has been accused of stealing artefacts and the fairy wants to recover the precious Aculos.With the help of bodyguard Domovoi Butler, a dwarf and a fairy. Artemis Fowl goes off to rescue his father and comes across a magical city of fairies, trolls and dwarves.This is a fast moving action film, with good special effects but it is also rather sloppy and haphazard. I sense Branagh's finished version was gutted by the producers.Having its theatrical release delayed and then dropped in a streaming service, I doubt this will become the next Harry Potter franchise.",Artemis Fowl
3,nogodnomasters,Time to Believe,10,13 June 2020,"My bad. I was entertained and enjoyed the film, falling in love with Holly Short. I have not read the books so I don't know what a hit job they did on adaptation. I saw this as Ireland's answer to Harry Potter in a magical world of faeries, trolls, dwarfs, and goblins. The production is geared to early teens of both genders. It is not overly dark, but then neither was the first Potter film.If you haven't read the books and don't have any expectations, you might find yourself scratching your head at the negative reviews.",Artemis Fowl
4,kosmasp,Harry Investig-otter,4,16 August 2020,"Now I am not familiar with the novel/source of this and when or how this was created. What I do know is that it does try hard to encapsulate and ""rip off"" Harry Potter and live off of that success. Now fair to say and as you can tell by the rating at the moment (which I matched), that most think they did not meet that standard by a longshot.Having said, the cast is not bad at all. The special effects are fine. So I can also understand those who maybe because they already heard so much bad things about this, went with lower expectations and actually liked this. But the cocky teenager that is fron and center here does not bode well, even if he has some good points he's making. So I don't think there's more to be said ... except that it looks unlikely this will get any follow ups soon ... (and watch the pitch meeting on Youtube which is as all their other Meetings super funny)",Artemis Fowl
5,siderite,"An utter mess for anyone that has not read the books, like me",5,16 January 2021,"So imagine my surprise to find that this mess was directed by Kenneth Branagh. I expected them to be one of those woke 13 year olds fighting to make a mark in the big bad world who won't acknowledge their nonexistent accomplishments. I have no idea who Artemis Fowl is and, after seeing this film, I still don't. I wanted to complain that if they're going to make a movie about Irish Celtic mythology, why not get some good Irish people to do the job? And they did! Writers and directors and a lot of the lead actors are Irish or maybe Scottish. More McPeople than I've ever seen in one place. And it felt like a McDonalds meal. You mucked it all up! You failed in expressing your own culture, you did!The only positive in the film are the visuals. They are quite well done. And the cast, if one can call it an achievement, since many of the actors in that cast are misused or not used and simply put there to attract people in the cinemas. The joke is on them. I mean, look at this: illustrious director - check, stars like Colin Farrell, Judi Dench and Josh Gad - check, children story from acclaimed book about hidden magical worlds - check. Beautiful girls that may become media idols in the near future like Tamara Smart and Lara McDonnell - check. Cha-ching! Nothing else deserves any attention. Characterization, none. Story, none. Feeling, none. Editing: abysmal - those guys should be fired.Why does the black guy have blue eyes? Why is Juliet in the film at all? Why is a world of technomagical fairies that live centuries and have a skeleton key to the universe afraid of the human world? Why can't we even see the face of the villain or know anything about her other than she is mad humans make fun of fairies? None of that is explained in any satisfactory manner. And the main character? An annoying kid who has not acted in ANYTHING before this. And it shows! The best actor in the whole movie was Lara McDonnell. She's 17! And I may have been mesmerized by her eye magic thing when saying that.Bottom line: typical Hollywood condescendence for viewers when making children's movies. I mean most of the movies they make assume the viewer is an imbecile, children movies are a notch worse. And worse, it puts people off from reading the book. Even if I had any inkling of an idea to read it, that's gone now. This film makes the writer and publishers of the book lose money!",Artemis Fowl
6,cricketbat,So much story crammed into one sloppy movie,3,19 June 2020,"Watching Artemis Fowl is like listening to someone read a complicated instruction manual at a very quick pace, without pausing to allow for questions or reflection. I get that they had to cram a lot of story into one 90-minute movie, but it just doesn't make any sense. Artemis is unlikeable, Mulch Diggums is annoying, I felt embarrassed for Dame Judi Dench, and the rest of the cast is forgettable. If you're interested in this story, skip the movie and read the books.",Artemis Fowl
7,cruise01,A mess of a big budget adaptation.,3,15 June 2020,"Artemis Fowl (1.5 out of 5 stars).Artemis Fowl is a pretty horrible fantasy adventure film that is based on a novel of series. Sure, it is the beginning and the end of a movie series. For a movie with a big budget, it is surely wasted and not sure where it went. The script is terrible and wasted with so much going with the story crammed in such a short running time. The plot is a mess. And the whole setting of the movie takes place with the fairies army invading Artemis house by the beach. The movies narrative structure by Josh Gad was just plain stupid. And annoying. The performances are tedious and bad. There was no emotional connections with the characters. The villain is undeveloped. And no explanation to the bad guys motive. The action sequences are boring. The visual effects seemed incomplete and cheesy. The direction by Kenneth Branagh is a complete wreck with this film. From the director that did Thor and Murder on Orient Express. This movie sure fails to entertain. I do wonder how would this film even be in theatres cause it definitely felt like a straight to TV movie with its quality. I do recommend to save your time and skip this film.",Artemis Fowl
8,digitalbeachbum,Laughable and they say the books were popular?,1,30 September 2020,"I see that the books got rave reviews, but is this a situation where the books were amazing and the movies sucked?There are a lot of problems with logic, continuity and physics. The movie, is loaded with them and this isn't just a ""alternate Universe"" problem. There are serious issues with the functionality of the movie.First, the logic is that fairies live in the middle of the Earth and have this really advanced world of technology. Fairies are not technology, they are magical. Sure, this could be an alternate Universe, but remember in the beginning they talk about Ireland and you know they are setting this up to be about Irish folklore and not from an alternate Universe.Second, there are several errors with the troll and the wedding. You'll see a skeleton of a cow that the troll ate, but trolls wouldn't leave bones and they certainly don't lay them down in a perfect shape to look like an animal in a museum.Next the entire, ""father leaving, getting captured, then a phone call from a raspy voiced being"" the story seems to be condensed. I'm assuming that this is done because there was too much information and Disney didn't want a three hour movie, but the continuity is messy. They also messed up the fight scene with a bunch of cutaways and shaky cameras, along with some very terrible CG. One moment the bodyguard, Butler, is hitting a fairy and the next scene he is holding one and twirling his staff.The other problems are the technology vs reality, such as the time-freeze. The time-freeze at the wedding allowed for the music to still play, but people were frozen in the air. If the air is frozen in place, then sound does not travel. The same goes for the Fowl Mansion, where they froze time and the boat and the fisherman and water, all froze. It is all wrong and it doesn't work.While I think it is cute to see a giant dwarf, which I have often wondered about myself, the idea that dwarves are thieves, pickpockets and only good for tunneling is ridiculous. Then there is the unlimited magic sources, which is stupid because they want to follow physics but ignore that for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction. There is a cost for using magic.Overall the movie really is lame and lacking in substance. It reminds me of Spy-Kids but with magic. Sure it is OK to enforce certain creativity when it comes to old myths, but in the beginning they talk about Ireland and make it seem like everything is about Irish folklore. There are countless other myths which are ignored just to push this movie forward, over the cliff to its death.PS - This movie sucked so bad that I started writing this review while watching it. I actually have it in the background and I'm listening to the story progress. You should try it some time. It really puts things in to perspective when you strip away the CG and the visuals. Pure dialog. That's when you really see the flaws.",Artemis Fowl
9,matthewssilverhammer,"They clearly expected sequels, but I can't imagine...",2,27 June 2020,"Feels apropos to review this Branagh film with Shakespeare: it's Much Ado About Nothing. This Harry-Potter-esque identity discovery adventure suffers from being completely overstuffed yet utterly empty. There's so much world-building to do, any marginal character development is shoved into didactic dialogue, and then never paid off. Specifically, who is Artemis Fowl? We learn next to nothing about him; he's just a construct to wrap a bad plot around.",Artemis Fowl
10,southdavid,"Fowl by name, foul by nature.",2,17 March 2021,"In this day and age, it's often bemoaned that committee made movies are strangling the ability of visionary filmmakers to make the films they want. If that is the case, how do we explain ""Artemis Fowl""? A film so spectacularly awful, so incompetently arrived at, that it's actually impressive how bad it is.I normally put a synopsis in my second paragraph - but this might prove difficult. Artemis Fowl (Ferdia Shaw) is a gifted young man, whose father Artemis Fowl Sr (Colin Farrell) is kidnapped by an unknown assailant. The captor then demands that young Fowl locates and provides The Aculos a powerful . . . thing. Meanwhile the fairie kingdom sends Holly Short (Lara McDonnell) to . . get the Aculos as well . . I think. The movie does a really bad job of explaining what people's motivations are.So yes, it's all a bit of a shambles. The performances aren't bad, on the whole, although Judi Dench is miscast. (Speaking of which, she really needs new representation. ""Cats"", then this, then ""Blithe Spirit"" you'd say it was deliberately trying to ruin her, if you didn't know better). The kids, Fredia Shaw and Lara McDonnell, are good - which is often not the case with a film like this. But the problem is the story. I haven't read any of the books, so I have no axe to grind in a ""they changed this"" type of way. I just don't understand what's going on - it's not explained in a way that makes it possible to follow it. I was expecting a world hopping teenage James Bond type adventure, but it barely leaves the single set. I wanted a smart crime thriller, but for kids, but instead I got a jumbled mess of half thought out ideas and bad CGI.It's the worst thing I've seen on Disney plus so far, even worse than ""A Wrinkle in Time"".",Artemis Fowl
11,lisafordeay,3 stars for the cinematography the rest is boring,1,12 June 2020,"Artemis Fowl is a 2020 sci.fi movie based off the Eoin Colfer novels and stars Judi Dench,Colin Farrell and Josh Gad,featuring Feacha Shaw as the title charcther.
The film begins with a mysterious guy who looks like Hagrid from Harry Potter (Josh Gad sporting a Batman accent) and a young boy
named Artemis Fowl Jr(Shaw) teams up with fairies to help him find his father Artemis Fowl Sr(Colin Farrell) who was kidnapped by a mysterious figure (who we never see their face btw).The cinematography is very good but the rest I couldn't wrap my head around it. And it's from the same director Kenneth Branagh who also directed Cinderella(2015) which is my favourite Cinderella adaptation,Thor and Murder On The Orient Express. So I found it very disappointing. The newcomer as Artemis Fowl was so bland he just wasn't likeable. The film's teaser wasnt even like the film as there was a banshee in the teaser,and none in the final production.Go watch Cinderella or any other film instead of this. Nonsi Anozie who played the captain in Cinderella also stars in this.",Artemis Fowl

13,alindsay-al,An Awful attempt at a new franchise,2,12 June 2020,"This film was meant to be released to cinema around this time but due to the pandemic Disney decided to put it on there streaming service Disney+ so here is my review for Artemis Fowl. The premise of the film sees a young man have to hunt down a secret society of fairies in order to locate his missing father.
Main Character
Young actor Ferdia Shaw plays the titular character and I don't want to be to harsh but he is not good in this film. He is such a bland character and you are literally given no reason to care at all, that is due to the poor pacing of the film but also due to his performance which isn't inspired at all. It takes all the interesting parts of the character from the book and waters them down to make him a really boring character.
Supporting Characters
Josh Gad has a pretty big role here and he did a good job here, not his best work but he is the most entertaining character here and the one who looks like he actually wants to be there and wants to try and make the film decent. Nonso Anozie does a decent job here too, we don't learn much about him but he has some moments to shine. Now onto the rest of the cast, Lara Mcdonell is here as a fairy and I didn't really care for her as a character, she doesn't get much development and the performance didn't do anything to stand out for me. Colin Farrell is in this film and he tries but he has nothing to work with and he is wasted here making it more frustrating to why he was even cast in this role in the first place. Then we get to Dame Judi Dench and wow she is terrible here, she has some weird Irish accent and has the worst dialogue imaginable to make this easily one of the worst performances that she has ever given.
Story
The story is so chopped up that you won't care about anything. First of all there is no indication as to really why Artemis is so intelligent and why exactly everything is going on, you are given no reason to care about anybody here and the plight that they are in. The issue is that with this film being rushed out I feel like plenty of scenes were left out which included character development scenes but they are not here and the film just makes no sense at times with a cringeworthy sequel bait ending which will never be followed up on.
Script
The script here is really poor, there is no humour and the drama is really weak as I said earlier which makes you not care about any of the characters. The screenplay is really poorly written and deserves all of the crticism that it gets.
Style
The style has some okay action sequences and some of the designs are good to see and have real potential. But the CGI doesn't always hold up and makes this film feel like it was from the 90's instead of 2020. The pacing of this film is also awful, it clocks in at 90 minutes and with the rush it feels like you learn nothing and aren't given a reason to remember this film.
Overall
Overall, this film is a waste of time. This film was clearly meant to be a start of a franchise but it won't be because it is a terrible film that had potential but was executed poorly and is not worth a watch.",Artemis Fowl
14,kwenchow,"Another worst film! Too many boring conversation, and overuse scene! The action scene also not intense!

Then pushed again. Then COVID-19 hit and all bets were off. Making matters worse, the trailers for the Kenneth Branagh-directed adaptation seemed to hint that the series was in for a set of changes likely to upset fans of the eight-book series. It wasn't the hiring of Judi Dench as the originally male-written Commander Root or the race-changing of Domovoi Butler, both cosmetic changes at best, but the adjustment of the cold, sociopathic Artemis Fowl II, around whom the series is centered, to appearing more light-hearted and heroic. Fans, take comfort in knowing that while this may not be the exact representation you know, there's little doubt that Artemis is a different sort of villain to root for.",Artemis Fowl
16,r96sk,A big misfire,5,19 November 2020,"Rubbish.There's really not anything good about 'Artemis Fowl', except for the decent score perhaps. The premise is terrible and poorly told, not helped by the fact it takes itself pretty seriously for much of the 95 minute run time. The pacing is off, while the effects are meh. I haven't read the source material, so can't comment on that.The cast don't work any wonders. Nothing personal against Ferdia Shaw but he isn't good in the lead role, I thought his age-mate Lara McDonnell did alright as Holly though. I like Josh Gad but his role here is bad, his narration is particularly ropey. Judi Dench's Julius is irritating too, while Colin Farrell and Nonso Anozie are underused.A big misfire, unfortunately. Not the worst film I've ever seen though. They openly set up a sequel at the end, which I'd imagine won't be happening given the reaction to this - a situation like 2007's 'The Golden Compass' potentially.",Artemis Fowl
17,MissSimonetta,It only gets a two because I laughed once,1,18 July 2020,"Even if the COVID-19 pandemic had not happened, I think Disney might have been sorely tempted to shove this onto Disney Plus and not in the theaters. The story is incomprehensible, with flat characters and badly plotted emotional arcs. I genuinely had a hard time following the story and could not have cared less about any of the principals, especially since friendships are forged in .2 seconds and certain supporting characters (like Juliet) and even the main villain are never developed properly, making it hard to care about any of this.I have never read the Artemis Fowl books, but a friend who had told me that everything which made the books interesting has been carefully liposuctioned out of this adaptation by Kenneth Branagh. I mean, I would love to watch a fantasy movie with an eleven year old Bond villain as the protagonist-- but that doesn't happen here, because it's illegal to make your main character even the least little bit unlikable in a Disney movie, I guess.And is it just me or does this movie feel dated? It has a weird SPY KIDS feel combined with a few aesthetics lifted from HARRY POTTER. It feels like something that should have come out in 2003, not 2020.I'm only giving this a two instead of a one because there was one genuinely good joke in the movie, delivered by Josh Gad when he's being sent to prison. He gets read his crimes and he says deadpan, ""Yeah, that's about right,"" which did get a chuckle out of me. But that's all-- there is no redeeming value in this corporate slop.I should just go and read the book. I recall classmates loving it when I was in elementary school.",Artemis Fowl

19,peterp-450-298716,"The making of ""Artemis Fowl"" on its own deserves a motion picture.",3,4 July 2020,"Who do you think you are?
I'm the next criminal mastermind.I'm afraid you need to be as intelligent as ""Artemis Fowl"" to understand and keep up with this movie. What a confusing chaos this was. I get it that they are looking for a sort of Harry Potter successor and already started drooling while thinking of the box-office with every new sequel. But they should have spread this single movie over a number of sequels because now you cannot make heads or tails of it. Let me remind you that I don't know the book series written by Eoin Colfer, on which this film is based. Let alone read one of them. A kind of introduction of the characters would have been helpful for the uninitiated viewers. And that's a big difference when you compare (and there will be a lot of comparisons) this Disney film with the Harry Potter films. Even if you hadn't read one of the Harry Potter books, you were sucked into the wonderful story about this mini wizard from the start. All the leading protagonists were carefully introduced and gradually you got to know them, appreciate them, and quickly one of the leading characters became your favorite. With ""Artemis Fowl"" you better keep focused because before you know it you have missed a whole storyline and a number of important characters. The amount of facts and things of importance is so immense that it'll make you dizzy.It also took an awful lot of effort before the film could be released. The film rights were bought in 2001 by Miramax Films (in the middle of the fantasy film period when Potter and Frodo ruled). Next Disney announced in 2013 that they were going to make the film in partnership with The Weinstein Company. The creation of this feature film was very different from what had been expected. First of all, you had the disappearing trick of some directors. Then there was the Weinstein affair with Harvey waving his wand too much apparently. Next came the disgruntled fans and last but not least the Coronavirus. In the end, it was decided to stream the film on the Disney + platform instead of screening in the cinema. For sure this was the best decision they could have ever made. No one would be inclined to watch it in the cinema after reading a few reviews. Unfortunately, the revenue from Disney + platform subscriptions is not enough to bear the price tag of a sloppy $ 125 million.What else went wrong besides the fact it's a very confusing story? Well, to be honest, I wasn't really charmed by the characters themselves. Artemis Fowl Jr. (Ferdia Shaw) is an annoying kid without any charisma and totally insensitive (A kind of MIB version of Richie Rich). A deadly serious little brat with an attitude. Admittedly, his intelligence is lightyears beyond normal and he obtained a series of diplomas at a very young age. Plus he comes from a wealthy family and probably took everything for granted during his young life. The magic of a film doesn't only depend on the magic of the story itself, but also how amiable the main characters come across. No one could resist the charms of Harry Potter (I know. There's the comparison again.): that poor little fellow living under the stairs, with his roguish smile and lightning bolt on his forehead. I really didn't find Artemis that charming. And even the more famous actors made little impression. Colin Farrell had a depressed and sulky expression throughout the film as if he already saw the potential for disaster. Judi Dench was actually the only one to stand out in her green leather fairy outfit. But that was more because of the charismatic nature of her character Commandant Root. And Lara McDonell looked adorable as the brave fairy Holly Short. You also had a centaur who could join Milli Vanilli. The dwarf Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad), who also took on the role of narrator at the same time, who's actually not a dwarf and resembles Rubeus Hagrid. And there was even the suggestion David Bowie was an elf (Talking bout humor). That's about it what I can remember from all personages. In general, however, the performances were not impressive or grand.There's also something to be said about the footage. They've put a lot of energy into it (maybe a little too much) and the film is packed with generally good-looking CGI. But a film about fairies, trolls, and dwarfs, who live in an underground hidden world, must look fairy-like and enchanting to me. They've decided to create a futuristic-looking fairy world full of flashy vehicles and modern buildings. And stuffed with a bunch of extras, busy decors, and an infinite number of props that you'll need an extra pair of eyes to take in all the wonders. But don't panic. This magical place is soon abandoned. Most of the film is set in the residence of the Fowl family. And there you can expect even more CGI (slightly less well developed). Perhaps it was quite an exaggeration when you consider the number of special effects. The only thing that impressed me was the jaw joints of Mulch Diggums.No, I'm not a new fan of ""Artemis Fowl"" and I don't feel the urge to discover the books. All in all, I found this movie version confusing and chaotic. I sometimes had the feeling that I was watching a new episode of ""Kingsman"" for young viewers. I didn't fully understand the principle of the time bubble and was amazed bout how Artemis could unravel everything so quickly (But yes, extremely intelligent. Right?). Maybe me being a grownup has something to do with it. I guess youngsters will like it. Although, I think my two kids, who aren't real book readers and never heard of Artemis Fowl, will be lost after 20 minutes. A re-watch might help better understanding the whole thing. I imagine fans of the books were very curious how Fowl's world would look like on the silver screen. Anyway. I won't wait for the sequels of this vague film. To put it mildly, I think the movie ""Artemis Fowl"" is a perfect fit for the current summer vacation that has become a disaster due to COVID-19.",Artemis Fowl

21,rgkarim,Has This Direct Streaming Flick Fowled Up Story Telling?,6,13 June 2020,"Movies today seem to run into more trouble than I can ever remember. With politics, reshoots, budgets, fan pressure, and who knows what else, the art of making movies continues to be twisted into the former shelf of what it once was. With Covid 19 coming into the mix, the age of direct to streaming has opened up a new era of movie transformation and I shudder to think what the results will be given potential cuts to the film. Ranting aside, tonight's review is another direct to stream movie, and one with a lot of delay history on hand, as another book series is brought to life in hopes of making money.

SUMMARY:Never having read the books, I went in pretty fresh thinking this would be Harry Potter meeting Men In Black with a bit of a family style added in. I believe on many levels my assumption was right and fortunately there were some heavy hitters leading the way. The stars for me were Dench and Gad, two actors who have their tricks for making the most of roles no matter how invested they are in the project. Dench's old school tactics and pot shots at age mix well with the ""charm"" of those she commands, a case of sensitive caring meeting dutiful officer entertaining to watch as she engaged with the new generation. Gad on the other hand continues to play his bumbling oaf of a snowman in a different form as the tricky dwarf who lives above the law in more ways than one. He seems to have fun with the role, and it's that energy that seems perfect for the character they developed for him. Gad acts as a focal point for the comedy, but Fowl's band of ""criminals"" sometimes have some tact to them that had me laughing at times, be it a well time one liner or maybe a sarcastic comment from Dench's character. It's all well themed and much like the rest of the movie has many ""family themed elements"" that I think Disney was going for in its countless troubles and directions with the film to which the target audience should love.
However, the strongest elements for this reviewer are the fact the more technical elements of the film that brought the world of fiction to life. For one thing, the music is great, despite having an AC unit blaring, the cinema design for Artemis' first journey is a splendid symphony of orchestral wonder that helps add excitement to the scenes at hand. More toned-down moments are complemented by a wonderful homage to Irish tradition with pipes, flutes, and the magical moor like tones bringing that fairy tale charm associated with Irish culture. This only further gets complemented by beautiful settings to which the cinematography captures beautifully and I for one was impressed with what they displayed on screen. As for the fantasy element, Disney continues to kick butt in this department as they always do. Computer design created a very elaborate world to get lost in be it the cramped halls of the Fowl manor with its hidden secrets, or the world of the fairy that dwells below the earth where science fiction and magic turn into a hybridized world that is both mystical and new edge. Add the costumes and character design into the mix, and you get that unique flare that Disney's money can make... when used right of course. I think many of your little ones will have some new trick or treat costumes this coming fall.Yet where marketing and splendor succeed, the movie fails for me at other parts. Like much of Disney's new family themed movies, the pace seems off for a typical Disney film as Artemis' journey sort of contorts to odd angles in an attempt to put everything into a journey to inspire every person under the sun. It's too fast for yours truly, giving many of the emotional moments a blunt edge that fails to tug at the heart strings it wants to pull so badly, the way Disney movies like to do. It does not help that the characters they tried to create are poorly developed, many having any dimension effectively ripped from them to make paper thin pawns for kids to aspire to be like. There are some redeeming qualities, I won't lie about that, but in terms of characters as a whole Disney's band is set for the adolescent minds instead of all families in general. It may also suffer from the fact that the actors are also still coming into their forte on this film. The young cast sort of has one or two dimensions and have not mastered the spectrum of acting that other actors have. Throw in some of the performances feel forced or not involved enough leading to less character utilization and the selling of this movie becomes harder and harder for me to do.
Maybe the plot and adventure aspect will be better and offset those limitations? After all Twilight has enough romance and fighting to make the film worth it right, right? No, the movie did not succeed on this aspect either for me. Artemis Fowl's limitations above carry over to this aspect of the film as well, leaving it a very skeletal framework with little sustenance for me. The adventure again is rushed, tense moments reduced to dry bouts of conversation, little build up, and action that has that modern-day family approved stamp that seems to plague so many films. Again those moments to grasp on to characters and worry about their fate become quick fix problems, where thirty seconds of an impasse show up and then resolves in some of the simplest story telling I've seen in a while. The action scenes start showing some pizazz, building up to Fowl's genius taking on this new world, only to quite in less than a minute. What happened to that magic we saw in Mulan, the lion king, Tarzan, and Toy Story, where the franchises were still to family, but were not afraid to add some darker elements to the mix. Fowl only does it with a few disturbing visuals, namely Gad dislocating his jaw, which would be more impressionable than a good action scene that actually uses its characters. An even weaker elements is how some of these fights sort have had technical jerkiness to it, like a DVD skipping, the scene would pause and then quickly speed up. While cool at some moments, it got overused and annoying for me, and felt like a distraction to the already limited scene.
The point this rambling makes is that the movie lacks intensity and connection to a majority of the audience, again too centered on the juvenile atmosphere that PG movies seem to have become. I also felt there was a little too much political agenda in this movie, not in the manner/degree we've seen in other films like Star Wars, Captain Marvel, and Charlie's Angels, but more like the Dream Big Princess campaign you see on Disney channel. It gets in the way of the storytelling for me and while inspirational, fans like me may lose faith in Disney putting plot development aside to stay politically relevant. Finally, this movie's inconsistencies sort of amplify that this rushed tale seems much like an intro chapter or installment to the book (which I do know enough for it to be the case), but in series like Percy Jackson and Harry Potter, those first stories also felt contained to their own tale as well. For Fowl though, the first installment focuses too much on the promise of a new series or movie coming in, perhaps another attempt to hypnotize into more toy sales. Had the other flaws not been so magnified in my eyes.The VERDICT:Artemis Fowl is cute and definitely the family friendly adventure theme that seems to be the new age of acceptable to many new parents. For this reviewer though, it gets in the way of bringing these young adult books to life, sheltering the intended audience from darker moments just to make a buck. Sure the acting will be good for the intended audience, and the music and visuals may be just the thing to hook you in to the film as you watch your children's eyes light up in delight (after all mine did for much of this film). However, the rushed plot, the forced acting, the lack of suspense, buildup, and intensity and trying to play too much in safe politics threw this film into disarray for me. While it certainly fits better on streaming rather than the theater, I can't help but wonder how much was lost to the numerous issues this film had with release. Yet, I worry even more that the studio I know can make out of this world films is losing their ability to story tell due to playing to the public interest movements. Nevertheless, I recommend this film for viewing at home of course, but take caution as some scenes may in fact be scary for those who are sensitive to the darker, more disturbing visuals.My scores overall are:Family, Fantasy, Adventure: 6.0

22,doomedmac,It was a mess,4,26 July 2020,"This movie barely qualifies as a movie. The plot has more holes than a slice of swiss cheese, the characters are blah, and the whole film is pointless. With that being said, it was entertaining.",Artemis Fowl
23,Kamurai25,Artemis-who cares,5,20 June 2020,"Not a great watch, don't want to watch again, and can't recommend.I've been waiting for a modern, well produced movie that I didn't like. It reminds me a lot of ""Wrinkle in Time"" (don't bother): high budget, based off a popular book, and just ruined from trying so hard to shove too much into too small a time frame and milking unnecessary bits.That said, the kids were all great, and the battle scenes were well done, but the adults had poor roles to fill: top tier actors reduced to bit roles, and I hated Josh Gad's character. It is always hard to take Gad seriously, but this was a little extra.The biggest problem was the writing: it is clearly taken from some book that I was supposed to read, but what made Potter work was that I didn't need to read it to get the movie, but if I did I got extra. This is I need to read the book, then get less by watching the movie.I didn't care about anything happening, and the world establishment seemed awkward. This is a Taken meets MIB meets the fey, and I should really be able to get behind it.",Artemis Fowl

26,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Again, IMDb struck my last review down because... reasons.",1,26 February 2021,"Artemis Fowl WANTED to be a new Harry Potter-like franchise but for Disney: the only problem was that the first film in this 'series' didn't excite anyone; at all. The script is shallow yet NEEDS more context for the characters and world it's showing us, the direction doesn't even feel like it actually came from Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh whatsoever, the effects look like they were from the early-2000s instead of 2020, and the music: it was piecemeal music fodder that riffed on every John Williams score ever made, all without having a standout piece of scoring at all.Right off the bat, this movie didn't get a theatrical release because it would have been massacred at the box office; and 2020's... life-changing epidemic didn't help matters either. Artemis Fowl is a Spy Kids movie that has a cast of characters wanting to have the same edginess as Batman; too bad they have no edge, or charm, here.Artemis Fowl gets 0.5/5 stars.It's a magnificently awful disaster of moviemaking.

30,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A jumbled mess that tried to do too much in too little time.,5,14 January 2021,"When I first saw the trailers for Artemis Fowl (2020), I was intrigued enough to pick up the book and read it. With its continual delays, I was able to also read through the first five books in the series. This may have helped me understand what Disney was trying to do with this, but it doesn't excuse their butchering of the source material. I can only imagine how confused people who hadn't read a single word of the books would be, and I was right on the verge with them.What gets me is that, as a fairly short book, Disney could have made a perfect adaptation in a scant two hours. Instead, they decided to cram so much ""sequel potential"" into 95 minutes to lose focus on any of the stories they were trying to adapt simultaneously. I also understand how the movie version is inclusive of all races and genders, but sometimes holding to how the characters were written in the book is the best route. After all, Judi Dench is a fine actress, but I was expecting a cigar-chomping man for Root, and not her.While there are many neat scenes in this movie, some of which are in the books, they're so disconnected that I lost interest fairly quickly. Overall, it's just kind of ""meh,"" which might also be the source material's fault. Sure, militarized and futuristic fantasy creatures is a neat idea, but if that's all there is, then that's all there is. I will give props to Disney for cutting some of the bathroom humor that the middle-grade book chose to include for humor purposes, but now they're left with another sub-par adaptation of a beloved children's book.A jumbled mess that tried to do too much in too little time, I give Artemis Fowl 2.5 stars out of 5.",Artemis Fowl

LAZY WRITING).The film is simply confusing, too fast, the young Artemis Fowl certainly has the correct surname and I honestly can't see how this would appeal to kids or adults because it is simply terrible from start to finish and I do wonder if Judi Dench and Colin Farrell are kicking themselves for appearing in such a low point to their careers.No care for the characters especially Fowl, acting terrible, story makes no sense and is too quick and could have been easily been a series and not a film but most disappointing for me was the sheer lack of understanding toward the target audience, doesn't appeal to either kids or adults so.....Rating 2 out of 10",Artemis Fowl

35,kjproulx,This Film Fell Apart As It Was Being Made,2,13 June 2020,"This has been a strange year for new movies. From studios releasing some of their anticipated films early on-demand to straight-up selling the rights to streaming services, Disney must not have had faith in Artemis Fowl, but nobody thought twice about it going to their streaming service, due to theatres being closed anyways. Well, they have officially dropped their newest original film and I'll admit that I was mildly curious about seeing it since the first trailer. There's no beating around the bush here though, because this film is just really bad, all around. I'm not one to rip a movie apart, seeing how much work really goes into making them, but sometimes the end result is just too much of a mess to praise.With all the confidence in the world, young Artemis Fowl (Ferdia Shaw) makes it his mission to hunt down the magical fairies that kidnapped his father. I mean, that's the set-up of the film and all, but this movie takes far too many detours to really get a grasp on what's unfolding. The most annoying aspect of this movie is present for a lot of the duration as well. Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad) is a character that is front and center from the very beginning, even though he's very far from the main character. They choose to have him narrate at least a good 30 minutes of the film and it's not just to provide context. His narration is pretty much there to describe every detail of the characters and the plot they are in so that nobody misses anything. This movie treats the audience like very little children. On top of that, this movie gets so bogged down in other side plots that the narration becomes useless anyway.After watching Artemis Fowl, I had to do a double-take when I remembered that Kenneth Branagh had directed it. Although I wasn't a huge fan of his rendition of Murder on the Orient Express a couple of years ago, I thoroughly enjoyed his work on movies like Thor and the live-action remake of Cinderella. His direction has always been strong to me, and I could be wrong here, but there's no way that he had the final say on a lot of this final cut. Over a year ago there was a trailer for this movie and a lot of the footage seen in that trailer was clearly from a different movie. This is yet another movie that has fallen victim to the studio pushing the filmmakers in many of the wrong directions.For the most part, the visual effects are definitely worthy of a mainstream theatrical release, but they made the movie also feel more childish than the story really was. In addition to that, I'm really not sure who this film is supposed to be aimed at. Obviously it was made for kids in hopes to start a franchise for them, but I don't see many kids being able to follow this film from start to finish. They will have many questions for their parents and I fear that the movie will be so uninteresting for them, that they won't even know how to explain it. This is a complete mess of a story that was taken apart and pieced together multiple times in the editing room, so I'm not even sure who's most at fault for this one. I don't want to single out a particular department here, but I would be fascinated to see a behind-the-scenes documentary for this movie.Overall, Artemis Fowl is a film that starts out as a Spy Kids rip-off but very quickly becomes this overdone film, which reminded me of how I felt about Jupiter Ascending, but honestly even more of a mess. I could see some solid elements of family trying to jump out of this movie, but anything worth noting is buried too deep to notice. I've never seen young Ferdia Shaw act before, but I hope he is given some smaller roles after this to improve himself because I believe his acting abilities were not to the calibre that a movie of this size requires. Even some of the musical cues in some of the more dramatic moments felt like epic pieces that belonged in an adventure or action sequence. Everything about Artemis Fowl just feels off and I was both uninterested and frustrated pretty early on. Even though it's available to stream if you have Disney+, I still can't recommend it.",Artemis Fowl

37,msbreviews,Yes. Artemis Fowl is *that* bad...,1,13 June 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)One of the most delayed movies ever, Artemis Fowl, went through severe production issues. Its plans started in 2001 (!), and only almost twenty years later it's being released... in a streaming service. Several directors and writers passed through this project, but Kenneth Branagh, Conor McPherson, and Hamish McColl are the poor souls that decided to stick around. I'm not going to extend this review more than what it needs to. This is one of the worst films Disney has ever released, live-action or animated!I have no knowledge of the source material, so I can't give my opinion about if it's loyal to it or not. However, I can write that it's a shocking, genuinely horrible adaptation of a book saga that I know holds an immense fandom. I'm so baffled at how bad this is that I don't even know where to start. I absolutely despise criticizing young kids' performances, especially when it comes to debuts like Ferdia Shaw's. But, in this case, I can't avoid it. I feel extremely sorry for Shaw, but his performance is truly embarrassing, not only due to his emotionless, bland expressions, but also the cinematography and editing.Shaw spends the whole movie simply reading his line, and waiting for someone else to feed him the next one. I hate to write this, but it's one of the worst debuts from a young actor I've ever seen. Nevertheless, it's not all Shaw's fault. The script is atrocious in every level, and for some reason, Haris Zambarloukos (DP) and Matthew Tucker (editor) keep the camera on the kid for way too long. Throughout the whole runtime, Shaw finishes his line, and the camera stays on him for extra seconds, waiting for the late cut, while Shaw's flawed acting is vulnerable.The screenplay and the lack of a coherent story are the worst aspects of all, though. As someone who had no idea about who Artemis Fowl was, how the worlds of humans and fairies worked, and what the rules of this fictional universe were, I ended the film confused and blown away by the messy structure. Josh Gad (Mulch Diggums) spends the entire movie narrating the events with the most awkward, growly voice, and Judi Dench (Commander Root) follows the same strategy. The amount of heavy-handed exposition brutely forced into these ninety-four minutes is absurd for a flick supposed to start a new film saga.Every single line of dialogue resembles some sort of announcement like new information has been discovered, even when it's not. The narrative structure is chaotic and tries to compact so much world-building that it's impossible to care for a single storyline or character. For the first half of the movie, I had no clue what it was about. There's a massive MacGuffin at the center of everything, a villain (?) who the film tells nothing about, and so many subplots jumbled together in a desperate attempt at making the whole movie make sense.The editing is choppy as hell, the action sequences are hilariously bad with surprisingly dated CGI, and even the score (which might be the only decent component of this whole thing) makes a few scenes even worse. There's also a side story featuring Lara McDonnell (Officer Short) that's also poorly explored, but it's far more captivating than anything remotely close to Artemis. The latter is such an uninteresting character, one who I didn't care for a single second. I honestly can't figure out how Disney was able to put this out.Artemis Fowl is one of the worst feature films Disney has ever created, without a single doubt. There's absolutely no redeeming quality about it. As much as it hurts me to write this, Ferdia Shaw delivers one of the worst young performances I've ever witnessed, but the embarrassment is shared by everyone involved in this atrocious mess of a movie. It's genuinely baffling how bad it is. It holds an appalling screenplay, packed with annoyingly explicit exposition, ridiculous voice-over (sorry Josh Gad), and an excruciatingly massive amount of information that couldn't be fit in a three-hour runtime, let alone such a short one like this. No storyline is explored nor executed properly, no character is close to being remotely interesting, every action sequence is a visual disaster, and the attempts at comedy fall incredibly flat. Technically, it's as shameful as the rest: choppy editing, flawed cinematography, and surprisingly cheap VFX. The only minor positive might be Lara McDonnell, whose performance I think is pretty decent, but I cannot recommend this colossal misfire.Rating: F",Artemis Fowl

39,MrDHWong,"The most embarrassing, convoluted, and downright shameful adaptation of a popular young person's novel since A Wrinkle In Time",2,18 June 2020,"Artemis Fowl is a fantasy adventure film based on the series of books for young adults by Eoin Colfer. Directed by Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Hamlet, Murder On The Orient Express, Thor), it is an inconsistent, chaotic mess on a scale not seen for quite some time.On the Irish coast, 12-year-old prodigy Artemis Fowl Jr. (Ferdia Shaw) lives with his father Artemis Fowl Sr. (Colin Farrell), a famous businessman who harbours a large collection of stolen artefacts in their family's estate. One day, Artemis Sr. is kidnapped by a mysterious hooded figure and held to ransom for three days until he hands over the ""Aculos"", a powerful item that when wielded properly, will allow the user access to several magic abilities. With time quickly running out, Artemis Jr., along with his faithful butler Dom (Nonso Anozie), a fairy named Holly (Lara McDonnell), and an oversized dwarf named Mulch (Josh Gad) work together to recover the Aculos before a war between different species can break out.As I have never read any of the novels from which it was based on, I can only view this film purely from an outsider's perspective. With that in mind, ""Artemis Fowl"" comes across as aggressively punishing towards any newcomers to the source material. From the very beginning, I was scratching my head as to what perplexed the filmmakers into thinking this screenplay was perfectly alright to greenlight in its current state. Rather than take the opportunity to gradually ease the audience into the world of its title character, the entire film feels like a rushed attempt to start a new franchise that the ever growing Disney empire will milk for its money's worth. This is evident in the blatant sequel-bait ending that apparently promises to fill in the crucial gaps that this one did not bother with in the first place. According to some post-viewing research, this adaptation has been in development since 2001 and encompasses elements from the first two of eight currently published novels. Additionally, the author described the original book as ""Die Hard with fairies"" which sounds like it could have been an amusing combination to see on screen. What we have gotten instead is the most embarrassing, convoluted, and downright shameful adaptation of a popular young person's novel since 2018's A Wrinkle In Time.It took me by surprise to see that a director as talented as Kenneth Branagh was at the helm of this steaming pile of garbage. Several decades ago, Branagh made great film adaptations of classic Shakespeare plays like Henry V and Hamlet, so for him to sink as low as being associated with this monstrosity is quite painful to see. His choices in quick cutting between the humans on the surface and the fairies in their underground city made it near impossible to feel any real connection to which world the audience should be siding with. A sense of moral ambiguity over what side has the right to wield the powerful artefact would have made for a nice driving force to the plot had it been handled correctly. There is no such plot device to be seen here so if the filmmakers didn't bother to invest in something like this, then why should we care?Speaking of not caring, there wasn't a single character I actually felt any emotional attachment to. Although, I will admit I think the young newcomer Ferdia Shaw, grandson of Robert Shaw (who played the shark hunter Quint in Jaws), did the best he could in the lead role despite his minimal screentime. That's right, the namesake character has a low amount of time on screen despite his name literally being what the movie is called! On the other hand, Colin Farrell feels like he's only in this film because there seems to be an unwritten law nowadays that if your film is set in Ireland and has Irish characters in it, he needs to be cast in some type of role, no matter how significant. However, the prize for looking most like they didn't want to be in this film goes to Judi Dench. The otherwise dignified actress looks bored as she unenthusiastically reads her lines in a croaky voice while wearing colourful outfits. I wished she would have taken the time to ham things up a bit to keep her performance interesting as it could have made for some funny and even redeeming moments but instead she remains poker faced throughout the whole thing.As I mentioned earlier, I have not read any of the original books so I am no sure how accurate this adaptation is but from what I have seen, it does a huge disservice to the series and fans definitely have every right to be angry. It seems in an effort to please everyone, this film pleases no one. The fact that Disney actually thought an entire franchise could have been started here is laughable, as no sane person would want to sit through another one of these films again, whether it is streamed online or viewed at the cinema. Take it from me - your time is way more valuable than that.I rate it 2/10",Artemis Fowl

Disney just seem desperate to create the next franchise rather than take the time to actually covert book to movie properly.Avoid the movie, just read the books",Artemis Fowl

42,cliftonofun,My kids did not even like this.,2,15 June 2020,"My 10 and 13 year old loved this book series - the antihero vibe, the magical element. When Branagh and crew opted not to be faithful to the books, they made a calculated risk: piss off the fans and create something more accessible for the masses. Unfortunately, if our house is a useful test case, everybody pretty much thought it sucked. My kids disliked it because it ""ruined the books."" I disliked it because it felt like a paint by numbers Disney adventure with horrible (gravelly?) voiceover narration by Josh Gad. In trying to make something for everyone, they made something for nobody. When Artemis called himself a ""criminal mastermind"" towards the end, we all literally laughed. Nothing about this film established his character or the story. Instead, we were told about everything...the world, the people, why it mattered. Show don't tell is rule #1, and this movie broke it.

Giving it an 8 mainly for the special effects and virtual world they created, but I think they could've made it more enjoyable to watch.This movie is a PERFECT example of a nicely made epic movie that just isn't very entertaining when you actually sit down and watch it (like the Star Wars movies, but I know I'm a little bit alone on this, also, since a lot of people enjoy them).Josh Gaad was the most interesting character, and I feel like most of the film could've been condensed into half of the time. They should've started the movie out with Gaad tunnelling into the house, also (or the surfing scene) -- it would've made a nicer ""hook"" or opening scene. The interrogation scene shouldn't have been B&W, also, with all that technology, but that's probably the wannabe director/editor in me talking.I'm sure a LOT of people would love this movie, but unless you're already in a good mood or really love fantasy ""magic world"" movies, I wouldn't really recommend this.

Director: Kenneth Branagh
Starring: Josh Gad, Judi Dench, Colin Farrel, Ferdia Shaw, Nonso Anonzie, Lara Mcdonnell etcOverall rating 22/100Artemis Fowl is about a young criminal prodigy who get's unintentionally sucked into a world of magic, when a race of fairies kidnap his father. This movie was just poor, with hardly anything going for it sadly it's the worst book to movie adaptation I have seen let's get started.Let's be nice and start with a couple of positives, the film's cinematography was great, and the film linked the two main characters and their friendship well. The film looked fantastic, and their was some creativity with it's shots. With all the different species explored well, so it was pleasant to look at and if you forgot about mostly everything else about the movie it had this going for it. I did also like the way they connected Artemis (Ferdia Shaw) and Holly Short (Lara Macdonnell) the fact that both of their dad's were being wrongly accused of things they haven't done was a good way to make their friendship believable and more realistic.Now for my first two negatives. There was some very odd creative decisions throughout and the film actually had fairly poor CGI in places. I thought some off the creative decisions they made in the movie really didn't work for me at all. Largely the odd on and off narration from Josh Gad when he was being questioned about Artemis Fowl, we hadn't even met his character and we had him talking over the movie and it just didn't work until the actual scene of his escape happened, the film had multiple bad and confusing creative choices that didn't work.My next negatives would be the lack of character background, the film being overstuffed with characters with no development and the lack of connection with the relationships. The movie just expected you to know the characters and what they do before they even explained it, for people who haven't read the books, they would want to get to know the characters as they would be new to them so this was poor. The film also had way to many characters with practically no background or development just the basic role within the film. Because of the previous two negatives I didn't have any connection with most of the relationships throughout. I didn't really believe or connect with the father and son relationship between Artemis and his dad (Colin Farrell) it just felt awkward and forced which is not something that should happen with family relationships within the film. I also felt emotional disconnect with the characters. Because of my lack of connection to the father and son dynamic it was very hard for me to feel bad for Artemis about his father or even when they reunited. And when the butler (Nonso Anonzie) died I didn't feel any emotion at all because I knew practically nothing about his character.My final two positives would be the decent amount of character background and information about Artemis at the beginning and the performances from Josh Gad and Judi Dench. When they actually spent some time giving us background on Artemis and a bit of development it was appreciated. We learned about Artemis and his personality and how he doesn't fit in at school because of the bad image his father has, it made you understand his character a little bit more, I also appreciated the performances and the character work done by Josh Gad and Judi Dench. Two professional and good actors, we will get into the negative performances shortly. Both their characters were very likeable, and they both went all out with their performances which was really appreciated and showed how professional and experienced they both are, which in a weird way made them out of place in the film.My next two negatives would be the bad performances and how generic the movie was. I really felt like most of the performances within the film were either bad or just seemed like the actors didn't really care. No offense to Ferdia Shaw as this is his first professional role and I partly blame the script but he was terrible as the main character. His inexperience was obvious, he was awkward to watch and always looked like he was waiting for everyone to finish their lines, even Lara's performance as Holly felt slightly amateurish. Plus the movie was so generic and predictable it took a lot of the fun out of it. You knew what was going to happen at the end. And some of the choices were so obvious it was just bad, and the Artemis's story of not fitting in and having a lost parent has been done so many times before, the plot just lacked creativity and uniqueness.My next negatives would be the rushed pacing, inconsistent storytelling, and tonal issues with poor attempts at humour. The film felt completely rushed and never settled on one particular thing. It just felt like it was constantly changing its mind about the plot, and the film just needed to be longer in order to flesh and further develop the plot and at least some of the characters. The storytelling was also inconsistent and messy, we spent more time in the fairy world then actually focused on the main characters, this was frustrating as this was also just poor worldbuilding as they didn't spend an equal amount of time fleshing out both worlds. There was some severe tonal issues as well, they were trying to add normal things from the world we live in into a movie about goblins and fairies and it just didn't work I found all the pop culture references irritating and out of place. These were largely the films attempts at humour and for me it just didn't work.My next two negatives would be the poor script and the underwhelming reveal. The whole script for me just felt very poorly put together and to be honest fairly lazy. The plot was generic, the characters within the script were poorly fleshed out, and the film just felt like it needed a few more drafts as for me this was not up to the standard of what the film should have been. Also, the underwhelming reveal of the object that Artemis needed to find was disappointing. The fact that the movie made such a big deal about finding an artefact for the villain so he could save his dad only for it to be in the house was for me a lazy creative choice. And made parts of the movie a complete waste of time.My final negatives would be the poor villains, underusage of characters and poorly trying to set up a sequel. The villains of the film first of all were hardly involved, and when they were they never really posed a threat at all which considering what they were up against was incredibly disappointing. Sometimes not knowing anything about a villain's past or what they look like is a good thing but sadly not in this case. And in general, there was just a lot of underused characters, especially Artemis's dad which was a shame as it made him be less important despite him being the one who inspired Artemis. And finally, the film really lazily set up for a sequel. I hope this doesn't get a sequel, I knew all the thing they were going to say they still needed to do, and due to my disconnect to the movie I just didn't care that much.Overall Artemis Fowl looked amazing, but apart from that was a poor movie. That just felt inconsistent, generic and rushed. And sadly, should not be the start of a new franchise.",Artemis Fowl
49,kermitkid,Perfectly family friendly,8,13 June 2020,"I really enjoyed this movie! I don't get all the hate for it. For the most part, it was pretty accurate to the book. They added in a weird subplot, but that was really the only change, apart from gender-swapping a character, but they didn't really make that an issue. I had fun with this movie. The way everything was shot, the effects, all of it was fun and aestetic. The acting was not horrible. I normally hate on Josh Gad a lot because he seems to be very ""Look at me! I'm funny! Laugh!!!"" and it's annoying, but here, he delivers the funny lines so deadpan, and that's what makes it funny. (Though, I'm not sure what was with his Batman voice) It seems genuine, as opposed to trying to be funny. Also, not a single curse word the entire movie, and no underlying agenda of any kind. It was just entertainment. The exposition was a bit rushed. (20 minutes in, and they're still giving us information, and a lot of it), but that was really the only issue. Grade: B 8/10 4/5 stars",Artemis Fowl
50,pranayjalvi,More of a messy parody than a real movie.,1,12 June 2020,"Artemis Fowl is a complete disaster right from the start. A hectic and frustrating 94 minute movie with no emotions, weak CGI and an incoherent screenplay. It's awkwardly staged, with rusty dialogues that is unexplainable and unacceptable.A movie made out of a long series of books, Artemis Fowl is bland and incoherent, with paper-thin character development, unimaginative world building, and an awful story telling.

51,TheCorniestLemur,Artemis FOUL,1,4 August 2020,"I don't know what it was about this film, but it made me decide to start writing full reviews so hopefully it'll result in something good eventually...
I've never read the books, but I've heard this garbage has nothing to do with them which definitely doesn't surprise me, no one could have possibly ever wanted this film to happen if this is what they're like.
Put it this way: I, like many others, was disgusted by those two Percy Jackson films from a few years ago, based on a YA book series I have read and still enjoy, but this makes those look like The Lord of the Rings and No Country For Old Men in terms of adaptations.
This entire film feels like one long first act, where the stakes are expected to be low until the world opens up a bit and the full scope is revealed, and just as that is happening, the film ends. The ""villain"" of this film, we are assured, wants to blow up the world because of some reasons, and needs our macguffin of the day to do so, deciding that it would be a fantastic idea to leave the delivery of said macguffin to the child of the supposed real hero, who has no knowledge of fairies, the underground world, or much of anything that his father gets up to at all. Also, bet it took them a whole minute to come up with the design on that dude.
And that child...sweet god, I feel so bad for him. ""I'm gonna be in a Disney film, I'm gonna work with Colin Farrell and Judi Dench, this'll be a great start to my career...""
...yes it would be fair to say I don't think it's going to work out that way.
I couldn't tell you whether his awful performance was even his fault or not, but I suspect he was probably the only person ever involved in this that ever cared at all. Unfortunately, that was not enough to save him from the ire of the screenwriter, who apparently decided that the best way of creating a relatable and likable protagonist was to make him Light Yagami but incomprehensibly MORE egotistical.
Nor was it enough to protect the other characters, most of whom sound like they have throat cancer for whatever reason and ALL of whom are drier than the tavern after St. Patrick's Day, or the abysmal effects, strange editing, and awful dialogue.
There aren't many films that I struggle to think of even one redeeming feature about, but there are even less that I cannot think of one redeeming feature about AFTER struggling to find one.
And just to make it perfectly clear, this film single-handedly made me start writing reviews, because it wasn't enough to just slap a 1/10 next to it.

It throws you into the story with so little set-up and expects you to know what is going or to buy into the world that it just assumes you are already love and believe.The kids playing the leads are awful. They are unpleasant, whiny and smarmy. Artemis's Men in Black suit is about the only thing going for him. Josh Gad is essentially playing Hagrid, badly. Judy Dench is there. collecting a paycheck. You really won't care about what happens to any of them. The effects are overused. The action pieces are too long, flashy and mostly pointless. And the plot is dull - something about a device and a missing father; literally the story of every Tomb Raider game and movie.I can't express how bad this movie tries and fails to do anything.

I don't feel like I watched the movie because I couldn't tell you anything about it, it's just like a blur.The acting was pretty bad and I don't know why but when I was watching it I just got this like early 2000s vibe from it and I don't know why. Like I think this would have done better if it was made then. It just had that type of feel.The writing was also pretty bad too.

His dad gets kidnapped and then that sends his son sort of looking for him.I'll get right to it. This film is awful. Come on Disney, how could you? A Wrinkle In Time was bad but this was somehow worse. This is probably one of the worst films I have seen in a while.To start off, it is sooooooo boring. You think it would fill the runtime pretty well because it is only an hour and a half, but no! You never really know what is happening or what the characters are doing. That goes along with how bad the story was. They didn't even leave the house the whole film to find Artemis Fowl. They're going on a quest or something aren't they? They just had Josh Gad do voice overs for all of the character introductions which is extremely lazy. The trailer also had almost no scenes from the movie. It was like it was advertising a whole different film. I bet Disney saw how bad a lot of it was and made the director shave off half of the film. That makes me wonder how long it really is. Will people who have read the book want a directors cut? That still can't save the film from the terrible acting.The acting! Don't even get me started on the acting! The main character is atrocious! Same for all of the other characters. I bet for Collin Ferrel did this for the money. Although I don't think this film made much of anything. Judi Dench actually seemed like she cared. She did that in Cats too for I don't know what reason.The CGI was terrible as well. It looked like a kid drawing pictures of cool powers on a piece of paper for the whole film. If this film was made years ago it might even be called bad because of the CGI.Overall, Artemis Fowl showed you what it could have been but didn't take you in to see.

I have read the original novel and this takes that novel and tarnishes it. I don't mind movies taking their source material and changing it. The Shining is one of my favorite films of all time and it changes the original book but they made a story that was interesting. This movie changed the story into the most bland, unoriginal, and boring story of the year. It's kind of insulting to the original novel. None of the performances are good. Judi Dench and Josh Gad feel so out of place here and Colin Farrell does absolutely nothing. The dialogue is cringy and the action is dull. The shots are uninteresting and the sequence of events is repetitive and boring. I thought nothing would be worse than Dolittle but here we are.

Artemis Fowl was made thinking this was a good version of Spy Kids, a movie that not even children would like since it's too serious for a kid lead role.In conclusion, this is an incoherent movie that doesn't quite entertain the audience, it is not for a fan of the books or anyone that hasn't read them.

But it mostly focuses so much on his house, and then the rest of the movie was gotten over with towards the end. The characters are bland as well. And the visuals are although nice, felt it was taken from something like Men In Black and Harry Potter. And the ""It's feeding time"" scene was really disturbing.

I guess they needed an easier transitional plot to introduce Opal?3) What were they thinking when they adapted Butler? He is literally called Butler in the majority of the books, since part of his training was making his first name a secret.4) Artemis is not vulnerable like this movie portrays. He is calm, cunning, and calculating.5) Why is Mulch so large and why is that made part of his character insecurity? It has literally NOTHING to do with the story.6) The thing with Holly's dad? Why did they create that? The ENTIRE point of the oak tree was for the ritual to recharge her magic, and was the only reason Artemis was able to capture and keep her. And that stupid device to somehow block her magic?7) They made the entire movie about a device that wasn't in the first book, let alone ever in the Fowl's manor.8) With the troll part and with Butler dying and being brought back, I understand they needed something more cinematically climactic than what happened in the book.9) Why did they bring Juliet into the first movie?I understand making some changes for movies, but they took too much creative license with this.

This seemed to also be like the brutal remake of Ghostbusters in the sense that here we have characters new to the world they have discovered yet figure out how to use their weapons in seconds. Same with Ghostbusters when they came out with all those stupid unnecessary gadgets.
This isn't a bad film but definitely misses the mark that I'm sure Disney was hoping for.",Artemis Fowl

It was OK to watch, it didn't get terrible but it never got really good either. You are waiting for the movie to get really exciting or to really fall for the characters, and for me, that doesn't happen.
Happy I watched it for free, if I would have paid $15 to see it in a theater + $10 for popcorn & soda, I would not be a happy camper. If you want a fantasy movie, check out Fantastic Beasts, that was better.

Artemis I pictured as Tom Felton's Malfoy in Harry Potter and like Robbie Kay (Peter Pan in Once Upon a Time type). The actor who play Butler is miscast; Butler was a big man like Dwayne Johnson not bulky. They made Holly Short and Juliet around Artemis age group. In the book, Holly was an adult and Juliet was teenage and she was Butler's sister, not his niece. They made the father know about the fairies exist and kidnap by Opal, but was kidnap by Russian mafia. Sadly they wasted good talents like Colin Farrell and poor Judi Dench in this disappointing adaption, This movie joins with A Wrinkle in Time as a bad film.

And after seeing the movie, I can categorically say, that this is not a movie that transcends well into multiple age demographics like so many other Disney movies.
IMO, this movie is more for younger audiences (ie. 13 years and under).Anyone in that age group will find this movie an entertaining fantasy adventure with some new imaginary concepts brought to life. But older audiences will find the movie lack-lustre and left wanting. But I don't believe it's that bad to deserve a 1 or 2 star rating.But I do believe the artist playing Artemis Fowl lacks the charisma and acting talent to pull off the movie. Perhaps more experience under his belt could improve his performance. But in this reviewers eyes, he failed to deliver in this movie.But apart from that, the movie was OK (I'm over 30 yrs old).

And those are all of the positives.No clear story to follow, the characters are so underdeveloped that some times I even forgot some of them where part of the main story. The acting, even from Dench and Gad, ranges from mediocre to unwatchable, which is the case of the two main kids in the story. Also, this movie clearly is not the original cut, as the scenes feel so disconnected from one another it feels that there are many scenes that did not make it into the final cult.

This movie is a complete mess from top to bottom. Nothing about the story or its world make any sense. There was clearly a lot that was left on the cutting room floor and I'm curious as to how much Kenneth Branagh was involved in the post production process as I'm just shocked to see his name as the director. I really wanted to give the movie the benefit of the doubt, the settings look visually interesting and I like the concept. I thought that maybe it was building to some big pay off, alas I was deceived, nothing happens at all, at least nothing I care about. Even despite the editing, this script is an absolute nightmare. No clarity to who or what is happening. Josh Gad gives a laughable performance as being the film's narrator/expository guide and it's just awful to listen to with his offbeat voice. The cast is full of very talented people and none of them make an impact. Judi Dench gives possibly the worst performance I've ever seen from her and that's saying something when you've seen Cats. I'm fairly certain I read this first book when I was younger but I couldn't even tell you what it was about. I'm sure the series has its fans, but this is clearly not the adaptation they would want. It once again proves that YA novel adaptations need to go/or adapt as a tv series to really stretch its plot/characters more. Even though it's on streaming, I still wouldn't watch it.

To answer the GOOF mentioned on this page, what child doesn't enter a room and open drawers to find what he or she may be looking for, it's not to such a stretch of the imagination to know kids are by nature inquisitive.

At least the Wizarding World is able to sustain eight movies across a viable franchise. I've never read the Artemis Fowl series, I only know them through osmosis, but it has a series of books, a solid fan base and franchise potential bubbling just beneath the surface, but based on this stinker, fat chance of that happening. It feels a like there's at least half an hour missing from the movie, which sits at an hour and half length, rather surprising, considering the state of recent blockbusters, and the usual length of Kenneth Branagh's filmography. At least he's got Patrick Doyle in his back pocket doing a rather good score. On the side is some good costumes, production design and a tease at an interesting magical world, but that's pretty much it; everything else had all the fun sucked out. It has kids who kind of act in it, except when they can't, sometimes in the exact same scene. Josh Gad pops in as discount Hagrid, doing a mumbly, gravely voice that feels like he's trying to impersonate a grizzled detective in a crime show. Then Judi Dench pops in doing her McGruff the crime dog imression, and then the villain pops in who talks like he's using the voice modulator from the Scream movies. All I could think of when he was talking was, ""Do you like scary movies, Artemis?"" The grating voice narration takes up half the movie, and felt like Christian Bale's Batman got caught in the throat of a hippo. I guess I'm not supposed to be laughing when a dark elf in a Emperor Palpatine robe and hoodie is talking into a magical iPhone, reading off dialogue that sounds like what a six year old would say to sound cool. Thanks for wasting a good premise Disney. At least you can go down in history as having one of the most boring, unexciting finales ever. It's flat like my soda, with some bland CGI on the side.

The characters don't have any sort of halfway decent character arcs anymore and everything is just done wrong. Whoever directed this was obviously drunk as hell and high on weed. A bunch of high school students with a $10000 budget could make something better then this.Artemis Fowl is the Anti-Hero, but Disney made him a hero. Artemis mother is sick and father kidnapped but here his mother is dead and father is still missing. Artemis is ruthless and a criminal but he is a genius and is always the smartest one in the room. Here he is a nice kid...Holly short is the ONLY female in the LepRecon division and is paving the way for others, here her commander Julius Root has been gender swopped and is also female so that basically destroys her entire story and character arcs.Butler is Eurasian and so is Juliet, here Butler and Juliet are black(I have nothing against them being black except the fact that in the books they aren't and therefore a racial swop is completed unnecessary and adds nothing to the film)Butlers first name is such a highly guarded secret and I won't say it here(I don't want to spoil it for those who don't know it yet) in the first like 5 minutes of the movie it's made public knowledge.Anyway enough of the rant, if you're here after reading the book turn away now, if you haven't read the book yet, don't start the movie just go read the book or watch something else!

112,warren-87235,Wow...,2,4 August 2020,"Just... Wow. This is one of those films that really gets you scratching your head. How on earth did it get made? What happened? Surely everyone behind the scenes must be cursing whomever or whatever got them involved. I've never read the books, so I have no opinion on it as an adaptation, only as a children's film in its own right, but this is a car crash of epic proportions, given its apparent budget of around $125m.There's so much talent behind this, that it leaves you utterly perplexed as to how it could turn out so badly. I can only imagine that at some point the production became such a tangled mess, that all of the talented people behind the camera threw up their arms in defeat, gave up, and decided to film just enough footage to throw together a semblance of something to please the producers.There's no point going into the story, because it's all such an incoherent mess that there's no point. It even requires a character to regularly narrate most events, simply so that there's a vague hint of why random things are happening (And the reason for that character's narration is itself flimsy).Most of the actors are perfectly serviceable, given the material, except the lead, Ferdia Shaw. I hate to say anything bad about a child actor, so perhaps this is all Kenneth Branagh's fault, giving an inexperienced actor so little direction and such a terrible script. As the title character, Ferdia unfortunately comes over as lifeless and wooden. To an extent, you can blame the story and script. The few scenes where he could have shown a hint of emotion are so badly pieced together that there was no real potential to do anything, and the story is so devoid of anything to make us like or care about his character that it would have made little difference if there was. In fact, he hasn't really _got_ a character, he just delivers lines from time-to-time.As for Dame Judy Dench... Oh my, she should have known better. She totally embarrasses herself in this mess, with a costume that makes her look foolish and a silly accent/voice that induces head-shaking despair.Moving on from the actors, the script itself is terrible at best. The child actors have to deliver lines that are not only unnatural, but are the worst forms of ""We're telling the viewer something directly! This is very important because... we say it's important!""Visually the film has the usual pretty sheen that you would expect from a big-budget Hollywood production, which is all the more tragic given the material it's utilised for.So why two stars? Well, it's never boring. So much is thrown at the screen, along with a relatively short runtime, along with so many moments of ""What the hell is going on? Why did they do that? That line was awful! Oh, Judy, why!? "" that it's near impossible to reach true boredom.Beyond that, this is one of the worst big-budget Hollywood movies I've seen, and I've seen The Last Jedi...

124,jaredkjacoby,An atrocious family blockbuster with very few redeeming qualities,2,12 June 2020,"The movie centers around Artemis Fowl, a child prodigy who also claims to be a criminal mastermind. The story is narrated by a rather large dwarf named Mulch Diggums who is being interrogated. Artemis Fowl's dad has been kidnapped and he goes on a quest with his servant, Domovoi Butler and a fairy he captures, Holly Short. He and his crew are confronted by the other fairies as they try to reach a conclusion that will help them reach their goals.So Artemis Fowl is Disney's latest sci-fi family blockbuster. It is based on Eoin Colfer's novel of the same name. What is odd about the film is the fact that Disney decided to send it straight to Disney+. Disney did not even try to find another theatrical release date for this film despite having a budget of $125,000,000. I decided to watch it today and after seeing, ooh boy, I now know why Disney made this decision...Artemis Fowl is an absolute disaster of a film. Just about every element of the movie falls flat. The story is barely a story. There are a couple of interesting elements here such as the fairies' ability to wipe out memories and stop time, but it is not explained and it comes off as unoriginal more than anything. The biggest problem with the movie is that it is incoherent and that it is an ""adventure"" film that pretty much takes place in one setting: Artemis' house. Artemis does not go anywhere else until the end of the movie and it is only to wrap up the thin plot. The world building could have been good, but it is sloppily executed which makes the world feel shallow. The movie cannot decide whether it wants to be campy or serious and it fails at both. The characters are terrible too. Artemis Fowl is such an unlikable protagonist that has that attitude where he thinks he is better than everyone. He belittles Holly when he captures her for no other reason aside from gloating about how he is better than her... and that is our incredibly likable hero. I heard that in the novel that he is supposed to be the villain, but movie never treats him like a villain at all. He makes up with Holly in the most forced way possible and they suddenly become good friends after just few minutes. Artemis and Holly have absolutely no chemistry with the performances or with the characters. They just suddenly become friends because... the plot requires it? Speaking of performances, I just want to say I feel so bad for Ferdia Shaw who played as Artemis Fowl. He is trying his best, but his performance is just dreadful. It is just painful to watch and his performance is definitely on the crew that failed him. It's actually his first role and it definitely shows. I hope that he will shine in another project some day, particularly one that is more competent than this. The supporting cast is not much better. Colin Farrell is completely wasted on one of the most thankless roles I have ever seen as Artemis' dad. He gets nothing to do. Why go through the trouble of casting Farrell if you're not going to use him? Lara McDonnell is okay as Holly Short, but her character is just the generic action girl with no interesting traits. Judi Dench is easily the standout as Holly's commanding officer, but she can only do so much with the dreadful material that gives her little to work with. Josh Gad plays as the comic relief and narrator, Mulch Diggums. Admittedly, he seems to be having a lot of fun in the role and he got some chuckles out of me, but the narration was rather pointless. In fact, most of the narration is boring exposition that explains to the audience what the plot of the film is. They also do something really stupid with his character in the middle of the film. Nonso Anozie plays as Artemis' servant and he pretty much phones it in the entire time. His character is just completely indifferent and flat. The cast is not the biggest problem with the film, but no one can save the material they have to work with. I mentioned that the film had some humorous moments and aside from a couple of scenes that made me regrettably chuckle and one particular scene that put a smile on my face, most of it falls completely flat. It feels so tone-deaf and amateurish. I honestly thought at the beginning that the film could be so bad that it's good, but it quickly became really boring. There are some unintentionally funny moments of dialogue, but for the most part, the film is just painful to watch. The climax in the film is just awful. Not only is it incredibly anti-climatic, but the twist for it is dumb.Despite having a huge budget, the movie looks incredibly cheap for 2020. The CGI is atrocious in this film. None of it looks believable or even pleasant. The fairy designs look ugly, the water effects look like something that would come from an PlayStation 2 game and the fairy world looks terrible. It is some of the worst looking effects I have seen in a blockbuster film. The only thing that looked good were the ships that the fairies traveled in. The set designs look better and there are parts of the fairy world that look imaginative, but it's buried under the poor CGI effects for the most part. The action scenes are badly shot and edited. The camera work during the fights is shaky at best and there are too many jump cuts in these scenes. Even then, none of the action is memorable or entertaining. It's just uninspired visual noise. The costume designs and makeup look okay, but their nothing special. The cinematography does feature some really good shots, but it also has some of the most choppy use of slow motion I have ever seen. Also, there is a scene near the climax that legitimately made my head spin and not because it was thrilling. The musical score is not the best in the world, but at least it is pretty decent. They fit the set pieces nicely and it is mostly pleasant to listen to while you are listening to it.Artemis Fowl is a horrendous sci-fi adventure flick on its own right and I doubt that it is any better as an adaptation of the novel. I know that this was made for kids, but that is not an excuse for this movie be as bad it is. It sucks because I would like to see more action-adventure films that are made for younger audiences, but they also deserve something a lot better than this. If you are looking for a live-action blockbuster film that the whole family can enjoy, skip this movie and there are much better options such as The Jungle Book remake, Detective Pikachu, Chronicles of Narnia, Sonic the Hedgehog or the National Treasure films. Those are all much better than this. Between this and Cats, I think it is safe to say that Judi Dench should probably fire her agent.",Artemis Fowl

127,markjohnevans79,Bit of a stinker,2,13 June 2020,"I've never read the books but I was vaguely familiar with the character. From what little I do know this film bears nothing in common with him other than the name. The film itself suffers from pacing issues and doesn't really take time to establish the characters so you end up not really caring about them or buying into the story.
Unfortunately the acting from the younger actors didn't exactly set the screen alight. It felt very wooden with no real emotion behind it and lines were delivered in a monotone way. You could tell they were trying to sound sincere but it came across as unnatural delivery, as if they were just regurgitating learned dialogue (which they obviously were but they way they spoke the lines sounded like the were reading them from an autocue).
You also never really get the sense that Artemis is this criminal mastermind he's constantly proclaiming himself to be as he doesn't really do anything to earn that grandiose title.

But was pleasantly surprised.I found the concepts and story interesting. I was able to follow the plot without much difficulty. I liked the costumes and tech of the ""fairies"" (in this case...any magical being from legend is labeled a ""fairy""--with different subspecies like dwarves, goblins, etc.)The effects were decent.

Make sure not to update anything whatsoever from the original book.2. Suck out all of the personality traits of the original characters from the book, and replace them with nothing.3. Make the most obnoxious character from the book series the movie's narrator, in addition to giving him a lot of extra screen time.4. Purposely change aspects of the book's story to now make zero sense, in addition to adding in plot elements that are equally nonsensical.5. Make sure that all of the actors involved give the worst performances of their careers and/or do an atrocious Irish accent, even if they live in the center of the Earth and not anywhere near Ireland.6. Give the film a budget that's over $120 million, but make the special effects look like they're from the early 90s.And... congratulations, you've done it! Now watch as your film gets absolutely ravaged by everyone and gets added to the giant pile of failed YA book-to-film adaptations.""Disaster"" is too kind a word for this film.

Here are my thoughts.First, I have fantastic hearing. But, I had a hard time hearing what the characters were saying. The audio was low. Plus, they always had music playing in the background. Once, I actually said out loud, ""stop with the music already!""Then, the movie is a total mess. I mean, there are SO many things going on, that it is hard to find the main point. There was no focus.The acting was not that great from some of the cast.The movie drug on and on and on. I mean, even after the thirty minute mark, I was ready to watch something else. But, I told myself that it may get better. I was wrong.The graphics were great. It looked like I was watching an A-list movie. It was a shame that such a good looking movie, was drug down but such an awful script.Honestly, I have watched so many movies in my life. This one, by far, is the one of the most boring, pointless, never gets to a point, lacks focus, is never entertaining wastes of time, I have ever watched.Kids MAY like it. But, there are a few things in it that may frighten them.This is the second Disney + movie I have watched and the second that I thought was bad.",Artemis Fowl

133,D31an,They kept only the very heart of the story.,5,16 June 2020,"And that is all. They changed the story as much as they could keeping only fairies and Artemis Fowl as the story's main characters. If only they could have, they would have changed that too. I was so bored whilst watching the film. I very much think Eoin Colfer does not mind anything of this, I think he is only happy for his novels finally to be made into films and that is all he is caring about. I could be wrong though... I just can not start describing all the flaws, and this film has many of them. Too much, actually. I rated it 5ive only because it is now a film. If I would rate generally everything in it: it would have been pure 1. I am utterly disappointed and I can not praise the film even if I would want to: there is just no valid point for me to start praising it. Some say visual effects are the only thing good in this film, but I need to disagree with it. Literally, I have seen far more action in Angelina Jolie's ""Lara Croft"". My theory is that Disney ruined ""Artemis Fowl"" only because he wanted to make it child-friendly. If so, I would be happy if he did not take it for sponsorship. It would have been much better if another filming house would have taken it and made it how it should have been.

I only saw the movie, because it has the Disney stamp,
and I thought it was a good quality product ...But but but ...The good:There are good things and many bad things with this movie.
The good thing is the CGI, well done, good quality, credible. Very beautiful landscapes of Ireland ... and end.
All good things end there.The bad:Everything that follows is for oblivion ...
The plot of this film hardly surpasses Velocipastor!
(and that's a very bad thing)The story is very basic, and there are strange things in the concept: there are fairies ok, so far so good, but ..., far from what one might think or expect. These fairies are armed and militarized with whom we could never empathize. The script and dialogue cause a headache. They go from hate to love with very inconsistent dialogues. There are super forced scenes.
There are camera movements that give circles that make you dizzy, leave the camera still for the love of God! We already know they have the software to rotate the scene!
And there are parts where everything is stirred in a (literal) whirlpool, which directly understands nothing of where the characters are.Several of the adult actors are of great renown and career, but they have really been wasted, sunk into small roles and making a fool of themselves.And about the character of the boy Artemis, it is not an original concept at all,
it's like a weird mix of Harry Potter with the guys from Narnia and spiced up with a little Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids,
but Artemis is much more insolent and emboldened than all of them together, I find it hard to empathize with the child, who never doubts himself (and is 12 years old) or is afraid of anything, does not respect the elderly and mocks everyone. This Artemis is arrogant and is not a role model for my children.Conclusion:
I do not recommend it!

Without even judging the movie on the changes made from the book, it is just badly made and I expected a lot more form someone like Kenneth Branagh. Judi Dench looks like she doesn't even know why she is there or what she is saying. The only actor that put in a decent performance was the one playing Holly Short. The other performances are average at best, with some being a bit over the top and distracting. There was one moment at the end of the film where Colin Farrell seems to changes seats in the helicopter 3 or 4 different times, which to me is a cardinal sin when you are making a big blockbuster movie costing millions of dollars. The worst part of all is that the author Eoin Colfer actually was happy with the movie and had some say in it even though it barely resembles his books. Disney is really scraping the bottom of the barrel to bring out new content for their streaming service.I don't even know where to start with the stupid changes from the book that just cause distractions....
A 12 year old criminal mastermind who only ever wears a suit becomes a 12 year old whining boy who likes to surf
A highly trained bodyguard who never reveals his real name unless he is dying as that is part of his training, has everyone call him by his real name, and cries a lot
The bodyguards 18 year sister who has been through the same training as him, becomes his 12 year old niece who runs around screaming in terror the whole time even though she is trained in all sorts of martial arts
Commander Root changes from a grumpy old man who doesn't think a female elf should be part of LEP-Recon to a caring grumpy old woman

It bears such little resemblance to the source material that if it weren't for the character's names you would have no idea it was based on the ""Artemis Fowl"" book franchise. Make no mistake, I am not talking about small variances, but rather a plot that was entirely rewritten from scratch. Why this was done is beyond me, as the original book was cinematic in nature, although everything that made the book interesting and cinematic was thrown out the door in this movie. Not even the characters were spared -- with massive changes made to their appearances, ages, personalities, and living situations.I used to think the Divergent film franchise was as large as you could deviate from your source material, but Artemis Fowl has proven me wrong.

So why the 19 year wait?!I have never heard of nor read the books this is based on. I had only ever watched the one trailer they released a few months back. I was actually intrigued at the time.As soon as I heard Disney+ was going to release it to their platform I was stoked since movie theatres are closed due to Covid-19.Then as June 12 rolled round and RT released the reviews I honestly couldn't believe it! 11% on RT?!Ignoring that fact as best I could I switched it on, and well I don't understand all the hate. But hey each to their own. I was anticipating a disaster but instead got a great sci-fi fantasy film with cool CGI, characters and easy enough to follow story.Honestly I didn't expect it to be remotely good based on the writers past material, but I was very impressed. At a breezy 95min it delivered pure fun entertainment and judging by the end I darn well hope there'd better be more!!Kenneth Branagh directed this thing better than I imagined. At first I was skeptical but hey it pulled it off. Now let's hand it off to Taika Waititi for the sequels.Overall I was personally impressed.

173,Delby_Welby,Atrocious,3,15 June 2020,Read one of the books and thought it was fine but not brilliant. So I more or less saw the movie like I know very little about the whole Artemis Fowl world. It was a bore. Stupid story made no sense. Felt rushed and felt like they were starting the movie's 'climax' too early - with no build up of character.

175,Dark-Wolverine,Wasted opportunity,4,13 June 2020,"For starters,I haven't read the novel and haven't heard about Artemis Fowl before the release of the trailer. So,this review is purely based on movie aspects.This movie is about Artemis Fowl(Ferdia Shaw),a 12 year old genius boy,who is a descendant of long line of criminal masterminds. His father gets kidnapped by a hooded guy and he needs the powerful ""Aculos"" inorder to return Artemis Fowl Sr(Colin Farrell). But soon,he has to face the powerful underground fairies who has connection with the Aculos and the missing of his father.Firstly,some of the visuals in this movie are great. That's it.To sum it up,this movie was pretty bad. They had a good source material and didn't even utilize a bit. There wasn't any story in this actually,the movie starts and within a few minutes,the whole movie is set up, there's no tension,the pacing is bad, everything happens so quick and you won't even see any character development in it. This movie is only 95 minutes long and they accomplish nothing in it. The acting was bad,some of the costumes were bad and there's no emotion in this movie. There are several movies where there's no character development or story,but, we'll be atleast entertained. Sadly,this movie is not entertaining.Overall,as I said,this is a bad movie, maybe if they spent more time in development or increased the runtime with more content,it might've been alot better. In frank,this $125M movie is not worth a watch for normal movie viewers. For fans,it would be a disgrace.",Artemis Fowl

This is nothing like the book as far as I read and the plot just jumps around all over the place so you don't even know what the hell is even going on, it makes sense when you realized they just tried to squeeze 3 or 4 books into this hour and thirty minute movie (And there are eight books, which I'm assuming they were planning to make a second movie. But since this flopped HARD I doubt there would even be another one). And they have the most annoying cast ever, I really like Josh Gad but I don't understand why he was even narrating this dumpster fire. Lara McDonnell as Holly Short is just awful, her character looks like if one of the bugs from Best Fiends was sent to radioactive laboratory and was genetically modified with Young Mary Katherine from Epic (2013). Overall, this film is really confusing. Stay away from this and just watch The Falcon and the Winter Solider it's hundred times better than this sorry state of a movie.

It is based on books that have captivated kids for years. It's directed by Kenneth Branagh and has the big budget backing of Disney.With all of that, this film still manages to be a plastic, two-dimensional waste of 90 minutes that is totally devoid of story, wonder or character development. It's the biggest waste of potential to come out of Hollywood in decades and that's such a shame since we *should* have a series of films based on the Artemis Fowl books, but this disaster of a film might just have put paid to that.Such a shame.",Artemis Fowl
190,The_Man_XX7,What a weird movie,4,23 June 2020,"This movie was just strange, when i saw the overwhelmingly negative reviews i thought i would hate this movie when i watched it but i don't. Yes it's a bad movie but almost everything about it was strange.Let's start of with the good. Well Lara McDonnell gave a decent performance as Holly Short, her character had an underdeveloped plot but i liked her performance in the movie. I know i'm in the minority in this but i mostly liked Josh Gad in this movie, yes the narration was unneeded, the grouchy voice was annoying (it's even addressed in the movie) and some of the scenes involving his CGI use was horrible but i enjoyed the charisma and witt he brought in the movie. He played as a tall dwarf and he looked like the only one having fun in that movie so yeah Josh Gad was a silver lining.The concept and potential was there and interesting as well, the first act was not that bad as you are introduced to the other worlds of Artemis Fowl like the fairy kingdom was an interesting concept and the CGI was decent early in the movie too but that potential was never realized. Being a Kenneth Branagh movie some shots looked nice and well directed AT TIMES with some decent set pieces here and there.Now the Bad. Ferdia Shaw who played Artemis Fowl had a hammy performance throughout the movie, at times he seemed too monotone and stoic and the other he seemed to be over-acting, it wasn't a terrible performance as he got a lot better during the third act but that was one of the many problems of the movie. Another problem was how scenes seemed to be stitched together and all over the place. Not to give anything away but the majority of the movie takes place in a House.The runtime is 1hr 30 minutes and it seems some scenes were removed and the pacing was too fast and dodgy as you're not given time to fully flesh out characters and the runtime is just filled with exposition and world building but you're never given time to care about the characters or the plot. Judy Dench also gave a weird performance with a grouchy voice, The CGI got bad real fast and this is a big budget movie mind you especially with some bad action sequences.The heist aspect of the movie took a backseat as most of it was explained through narration which took away any thrill or suspense. The villain was awful as he/she has a generic motivation to take over the world and i don't mind that but there is no backstory or any reason to be invested in the villain so it just ends up being generic movie bad guy 101 oh and he/she has a grouchy voice, i have no idea why this movie had an obsession with grouchy voices.Colin Farrell as Artemis' father had the potential to be an interesting character but as soon as you're introduced to him, he is immediately gone. The adventure aspect is also poorly executed and the way how the main conflict is resolved is just baffling.Like i said the whole movie was strange, Also some scenes drag on and we are talking about a 1hr 30 minute movie here and the story never goes to interesting places and again you never care for the characters. So overall, didn't hate his movie, but it's not a good movie by any means.",Artemis Fowl
191,hecklerandjokmm,Lead actor makes wood look like Marlon Brando.,2,12 June 2020,"My original review was deleted it was up 1 day then down today. I've heard the books are good I haven't read them will check them out someday but not because of this abomination. Kenneth Branaghs worst film wastes Colin Farrell and has two planks of teenage wood act with each other, Gad who plays Mulch is irritating but all the other characters are somewhat worse. I was told it was fantasy sci-fi detective series but the detective bit was missing here. The story about exposing fairies was embarrassingly bad it all looks like your typical young adult fantasy film but without a good story, charisma, chemistry and magic the threat is not there it reminded me of wrinkle in time and the failed Golden Compass movie but worse even a bit like Jupiter ascending but worse which is crazy. It's all very bland and forgettable. This is up there with The Last Days of American Crime, Brahms, The Grudge, Gretel & Hansel and Birds of Prey for worst film of 2020.",Artemis Fowl

194,Sabaher,I refuse to believe that Kenneth Branagh directed this,1,13 June 2020,"This film is incredibly awful. Just 2 or three shots of the teaser trailer are in the movie. They basically shot a trailer. The young actor that played Artemis Fowl II (Ferdia Shaw), this is his first ever credit on IMDb. I feel so bad for this kid. This is a terrible performance. It feels amateur in every way. It feels like whenever he gets one of his lines out his face locks up. It's downright cringey and embarrassing. The worst part of this movie is that it feels like it has no story. The core story of this movie is that Artemis Fowl sr. (Colin Farrel) is kidnapped. Whoever kidnapped him wants this thing that would give him infinite story. It's a giant MacGuffin that everyone wants. So Artemis Fowl II has to find this thing so he can get his dad back. That's what the film is about summarized on paper, but that's not what the movie's about. The movie has no idea what it is about. Josh Gad narrates almost the entire movie. The first six minutes is nothing but exposition and it continues so heavy-handed throughout the entire film because they don't know how to condense this story into 94 minutes (super short). Our main character is supposed to be liked by everyone, but he is super annoying and not interesting. Because of that you don't really care about what he's doing. This is easily in the top 10 worst live action Disney movies ever made. This is barely a movie. It's barely a story. If you're a fan of these novels, you're probably going to hate this. This is more of a spy kids movie than an Artemis Fowl movie. Keep in mind that this movie cost $125 million, directed by someone who has directed good films in the past and has talented people in it. For some reason it feels like a stack of scenes strung together to last 94 minutes. It doesn't feel like it has story, charcters, or any compelling elements. It just feels like a property that has been given a feature film treatment. It's so bad and very dissapointing.",Artemis Fowl

The ENTIRE concept of the Artemis Fowl character is that he is a criminal genius with a MISSING father and a mentally unstable mother. Those are the facts that drive the character in the book. Those are also the facts that the movie completely changed. It's like if you made a movie from the first Harry Potter book, eliminated magic, set it in New York and made Ron the evil character. If might be a good movie but it WOULD NOT be Harry Potter any more.

Judie Dench and Colin Farrell are among my favorite actors. Unfortunately their roles were very limited.
The young actors did a solid job.
Unfortunately, this didn't improve the script, which left a lot to be desired.
Especially Domvoi Butler's niece was a disappointment. In the books it is his sister, who can also give a good grip.
The niece is introduced as a tough girl, but the only thing she does in this movie is to bring Artemis a sandwich.
Why? Why was this character in the film if she doesn't get at least a few action scenes?

214,MovieWatcher2021,"Nice Cinematics, weak story, and tone deaf movie",4,21 June 2020,"Artemis Fowl is a standard Disney movie, the cinematic, the music, the costume, most of the actors, all were superb. From the beginning to end, the movie goes smooth and it kind of managed to end the story.
However, not sure whatever the reason, the story really sucked. After watching for more than an hour or so, I kind of felt that the whole movie didn't have any good story. The whole story could be told in two to three lines. Also, the movie had lots of 'filler' actions, actions were added to make the movie longer, instead of contributing to the story. There were many unanswered questions, many contradictory statements.
Now, the main actor, he was a young boy, he tried his best. But, he was overdramatic, it was clear that sometimes he was walking or behaving too dramatic for the sake of the camera. At the end, even if he was a genius, he made a rookie mistake! Of course, you need to watch the movie, regardless how bad it is, to find that mistake!
At the end, while Black Lives Matter and the protest against anti-Black racism and stereotype are going on, this movie made it clear that Disney actually supported slavery and black stereotype (in England, in modern days, only Servant in the movie was Black). Except giving the guy blue eyes, also another tone-deaf approach to show that blue eyes are better than original black eyes of the Black folks, his only role in the movie was to serve, and listen to a white kid with questionable judgement. The master of the house was multi-generational rich and white person, and most probably a big supporter of slavery. Just like Mulan, a movie to please the Commies, Disney released another tone-deaf movie exactly proving the point that systematic racism exists in mainstream media.",Artemis Fowl

221,nick-1896,Awful,2,20 June 2020,"It's a cliche to say the book was better. But it really was. This movie was so bad it actually tainted the memory of Eoin Colfer's excellent series. I heartily recommend you purchase the books instead, read them, and never watch this rubbish. Even if you get it free, you're still wasting your time and ruining a good read. I always thought the series was so visually descriptive and imaginative that it was just crying out for a film franchise. But somehow Disney took a gift brief and utterly stuffed it. Mulch Diggums should've been great but they made him a Hagrid clone who ends up clumsily narrating the whole story because the film-makers were too lazy or stupid to write a decent script. Dame Judy Dench is utterly wasted. Colin Farrell likewise. Neither have much to do but plod through heavy handed exposition. The titular Artemis Fowl is poorly acted and somehow they wrote out a lot of the reasons the character was so well loved. Throughout the books he's a bit of a nerd - and proud of it. He's the brains not the brawn - a positive role model to young kids who are more academic than sporting. But no. The opening scene has Artemis surfing like a pro and jumping a hoverboard. Later he fires a laser gun like he's been doing it all his life. Very disappointing. And so much for the 'little people'. Obviously budget didn't stretch to scaling pixies and leprechauns down because they were all adult size - just a set of pointy ears and done. Imagine if the Hobbits in Lord of the Rings were just people size. Half the charm is that they're little yet make a big difference. It's just lazy. Only a smattering of terrible CGI... I don't even know what they were - gnomes?? reminded us of the rich vein of legends and stories this movie steadfastly refuses to acknowledge. This was most evident in Holly who looked like a child, not a small adult. And Judy who was large and in charge as Commander Root - a curmudgeonly male in the book. Folley is horribly over-acted. Butler and his daughter are an awful token effort to inject some coloured actors. It feels forced and yeah, nice work Disney, you made him the butler. The ubiquitous CG effects give the whole thing a synthetic look. It felt like a horrible mishmash of early 90's Marvel movies and the worst bits of Harry Potter - filmed entirely on blue screen sets with stagey lighting. Aaarrg. I could go for hours. Just take my word for it and go read the books. Like the prequel Star Wars movies - forget this film exists or it'll ruin the previous material for you.",Artemis Fowl

It feels unoriginal, and the spy-kids theme does not work with this movie. THis film also feels very emotionless and bland. The visual effects and CGI is not good and feels like it was copied from MCU movies, the acting is just rubbish and emotionless. I just don't understand why a movie this bad was allowed into streaming services such as Dinsey+ and I do not understand its existance. This movie is honestly unbearable and very predictable too, I mean in the first 10 minutes I knew that this was going to be a bad film, in fact it was bery unbearable that I stopped watching halfway through this film.Overall, this is possibly along with the Wrong Missy and Scoob! one of the worst movies of 2020 so far, it might change as the year goes along but I am just very angry at the moment.Please do not watch this film.",Artemis Fowl

230,jackransom-69832,Artemis Fowl,1,12 June 2020,"After several delays and a cancelled cinematic release, Artemis Fowl arrives on Disney+ today. The film sees Artemis Fowl (Ferdia Shaw), a young criminal prodigy, hunts down a secret society of fairies to find his missing father (Colin Farrell).Having never read any of the novels or knowing the source material aside from the name, I didn't have an emotional or already existing investment in the source material, so this film didn't irritate from that perspective like it has done to the fans (due to the negative reactions to the trailers and the reviews of this film). No, Artemis Fowl irritates me purely from a filmmaking and narrative perspective and for wasting 96 minutes of my life on its boring, convoluted, poorly written, blatant sequel/universe set up story, poor performances of uninteresting and irritating characters and a laughable production value at times.The story is a choppy mess, in which the writers clearly didn't know whether they wanted to make a straight up origin story or an original tale in which the characters are established. Instead the film attempts to do both, as well as craft a launching platform for a sequel (which I guarantee won't happen). There is so much lore, terminology, locations and name drops thrown at the screen with 90% of the dialogue being expository, of which is delivered insufferably by Josh Gad's character in a ridiculous and grating gravelly voice. The villain (I honestly don't think they even name them and they never even interact with Artemis) motivation is utterly boring and lacks any depth. The pacing is terrible, due to the lack of plot focus the film feels far longer than its 96 minute runtime.Visually the film varies wildly from at times decent CGI and a bold colour palette to a low budget TV show set design and awful special effects. This is the same with costume and prosthetic designs that vary from fairly impressive to tacky and garish. The purely CGI characters have a bizarre frame rate and almost blur around them which is especially prevalent in the Troll battle sections in which the choreography is a complete mess, with poor editing and lacks thrills. The last battle you will have seen so many times before and done better in other similar genre films.The performances are basically all bad. I don't want to be too harsh on the child actors but they are awful here, Artemis lacks any personality or presence, and whenever he and the other kids have dialogue it normally descend into shrieking annoyance. Josh Gad is the 'comic relief' and exposition machine. He gives an unfunny and cringe inducing performance with his voice at times switching tone from line to line. Colin Farrell completely phones in the 3 or 4 scenes he is in and Judi Dench is laughable as the deep voiced (it rivals Gad's) leader of the fairies.Artemis Fowl is an utter waste of time, a boring, convoluted, uninspired, annoying chore that Disney have thrown onto their streaming service because it would have completely bombed in cinemas. More like 'Artemis Fail'.",Artemis Fowl

237,targaid,An insult to source material and fans,1,13 June 2020,"The announcement of an Artemis Fowl adaptation thrilled us. The series was bedtime reading for my daughter for years. She's re-read them on her own repeatedly. Kenneth Brannagh has crapped all over them and left us with something less appealing than the effluvia from Mulch Diggums's bum-flap.
Storyline? Abandoned and replaced with generic mcguffin hunt. Setups for future stories are ignored making it impossible to progress as Colfer planned and doing a Rian Johnson on any future directors should this persistent floater somehow manage to garner a sequel.
Characters? Changed on fundamental levels, undermined and devalued in every way. Character arcs and development are abandoned. Relationships are fundamentally altered and one character, vital to later stories is dead offscreen before this even gets going. Juliet, who didn't appear in the first book, is stuck in but then used to do nothing but offer other characters food rather than being the badass she would be and is introduced as.
World building? Inept and confused (Just why would the fairies have a table that's too big for them?) Fails to explain vital points for the uninitiated, wastes too much time badly explaining stuff that shouldn't even be there.
Script? Clumsy, stumbling inanely from cliche to cliche. Underestimating the audience's intelligence at every moment and where clunky exposition wasn't forced into a character's mouth it's slapped on in an awkward, out-of character narration.
Virtue signalling? There in spades but actually undermining the way the books challenge equality issues and the diversity it actually includes. Holly is supposed to be brown, so she's whitewashed. The Butlers -strangely no longer brother and sister - are meant to be Oriental (yes, I know Americans don't like that word but Asian means something different here and would mask the point I'm trying to make). Both of them fail dismally to do their jobs within the story or to represent the characters in the books. Holly is meant to be the first female officer in L.E.P.- Recon that's abandoned. Artemis' outsider status is given a moment's lip-service between showing him as a cool, active jock rather than relying solely on his intelligence and using assets like Butler to compensate for his shortcomings. Here, he has none.
There isn't one single redeeming feature in this, unless it's that Holly's uniform fits with how we always imagined it.",Artemis Fowl

Released June 12th, 2020
Disney+Starring: Ferdia Shaw, Josh Gad, Colin Farrell, Judi Dench, Nonso Anozio
Directed: Kenneth BranaghWell...sigh...huh??? I suppose when you look at all the finer details of this production from Walt Disney Studios, I have no idea why I was so surprised of the final cut that was essentially dumped (over three...THREE years after principal photography) on their streaming service over a year after their initial theatrical release date. The first teaser trailer for Artemis Fowl dropped on March 2nd, 2019. Talk about the anticipation! If I'm not mistaken, allot of the footage we saw in this teaser trailer did not even make it into the final cut of the finished product. Not really a shocker considering it was only announced that Colin Farrell was going play the role of Artemis Fowl Sr. in March of this year! After the rumours of numerous reshoots and the runtime of the final product that we had the (dis)pleasure of watching, I still didn't think that this was actually the film that we were going to get post production. I can only imagine how long the first edited version of this film would have been - compared to the final 90 minute epic failure this was! And...I didn't even read the literature for this film that I know is beloved by many fans. I feel especially sorry for everyone who actually read the source material and waited so long with such high anticipation and this was what they got.This film is an absolute mess. I am not going to get into specific details but you can tell they completely destroyed the continuity of the story during the editing process. There are soooo many gaps and plot holes in this film. I found myself rewinding sequences several times to make sure I in fact didn't miss a scene or some imortant piece of dialogue. And I am sure this goes without saying, but what the hell was Josh Gad and Dame Judi Dench thinking (or even more disturbing director Kenneth Branagh thinking with this idea of having these two talented actors portraying their versions of Christian Bale's Dark Knight - their voices were insufferable!) when rolling through each scene??? Kenneth Branagh is a fairly talented director and actor (IMDb credits include 2017's Murder on the Orient Express, 2015's live action remake of Cinderella, & Thor) and so I really expected a little more from the direction and efforts from the cast. And as badly as I feel for Ferdia Shaw and his efforts to bring beloved 12-year old diabolical genius and mastermind Artemis Fowl to the big screen, it really wasn't his fault for the failure of this movie. I truly feel sorry for him as this was literally his first acting role EVER; and it is very apparent throughout the film. I just think that with all the time this production wasted and all the choppy editing and reshoots, they would have figured out that they may have cast the wrong actor for this role. And finally, if you were to overlook the choppy editing and screenplay, poor dialogue, poor casting choices and character depictions, and massively apparent plot holes, I was at the very least hoping for a visually stunning film...let's just say some of the CGI is...to not put too fine a point on it, was distracting.Whoa...this is exactly why I didn't really want to do a review of this film. I know how much work and time and blood, sweat, and tears goes into making a film, especially with the massively high expectations of adapting a beloved novel series, and so I feel truly bad for this final product. There will be younger audience out there that can easily overlook all of the things I've mentioned and thoroughly enjoy this film, but honestly, this was a catastrophic misfire by Walt Disney Studios. They squandered a massive opportunity to create a franchise. But now, forced to dump this film on their streaming service and with such overall poor reception by practically everyone, I doubt we ever see another Artemis Fowl film.Despite how many things went wrong with this film, and I may actually never give it a second viewing, it was still nowhere close to the worst film I've seen in 2020.

It is horrible. While the visuals are good,the acting is bad.The story is fragmented,confusing and disjointed. There is no heart in this story. Yet for me the worse part about this movie is the 'hero ' himself.Artemis is an obnoxious know-it-all who lacks any humor or charm.Maybe the books paint him as an elite brat who thinks his intellect awards him the ability to be 'Fowl' to others, but it is not an admirable quality. The acting by the young Artemis is also quite bland and void of any real emotions.
Dame Judy should not be in this movie...this mess should not be on her record and Colin did well to hide himself for most of this film.

Oireland"" I knew there was no redemption. It's hard to fathom that garbage like this can still get so far in production before being redirected to the nearest recycle centre. It comes as no surprise that Kenneth (wooden)Branagh was attached to this given the hatched job he did on the Shackleton Biopic but this, this film should be a criminal offence.From about ten minutes in I wanted to scoop out both eyes with a melon baller and swirl it about in the sockets. I actually felt nauseated after that but persisted in the vain hope that either the film would magically turn about or an asteroid would hit. I often heard that a story has plot holes but this plot hole had no story, at all. With any other title one would be wary of spoilers in reviews but here to say there was anything to spoil would be a monstrous lie.In short (and not that dreadfully aggravating fairy of the same name) anyone who can read and loved those books, please avoid this at all cost, what with Covid19 and recession, this will send you right over the edge.

This makes a mockery of the grading system in truth.Granted I am not the target age group for a Movie of this type but having so little respect for younger viewers causes its own problems down the line.Quite simple IMHO it was the worst pile that has ever come out of Disney in quite a time and signifies the deeply cynical nature of young adult entertainment today. It bore no relation to the trailers that preceded it and appeared to be glued together in a rush.Finally to those who are trying to raise the grade of this movie for whatever reason, possible inspired by money or the Disney corporation , just stop, it won't work.

245,sallyannandrew,Why?,2,13 June 2020,"I know I'm jumping on the hate bandwagon here, but I just can't understand why you would adapt a beloved book series into a film and completely ignore the what is in the books?! Do production companies just care about drawing you into see the film, and not care that we are all going to hate the film? Do they not care about actually making a decent film anymore?! Is it just all opening numbers and profit sheets and as long as they lure enough people in initially to pay for the stupid movie, they don't care whether we like it or not?!And why change it? What metrics do they use that suggest to them that completely changing the characters and storyline is a good plan? I know not everything in a book can be adapted
to film and things need to be shortened and changed a little to make it work, but honestly, why change the whole thing?! Do they truly think they can do it better than the source material? How often does that work?! The book is almost always better.This is not Artemis Fowl, this is 'loosely based' on Artemis Fowl, they have completely changed the character, his motivations and most of the things that make this book series so fantastic. It's boring and by the numbers. It must be so disappointing for authors like Eoin Colfer to see their books turned into these terrible films! If only every author had as much clout as JK Rowling.I have given this a couple of stars only because some of the performances were good, despite the terrible script and story they were working with. Josh Gad and the actress playing Holly did a solid job trying to work with this terrible mush.I hope this doesn't make Disney buckets of money just because it's going to draw in fans of the books, they don't deserve it.",Artemis Fowl
246,caleblimsw,"""It's a kid's movie"" is not a good excuse",2,16 June 2020,"Let's make this clear. I'm still a kid. Or at least, I'm not yet a legal adult. More importantly, I love and openly enjoy kids movies every time, movies like Onward, How To Train Your Dragon, Sonic the Hedgehog, Christopher Robin etc. This movie is nothing like the ones I've mentioned above.This movie is a massive dumpster fire, and that's even before I add in my complaints as a book fan.First, let's talk the movie without the context of the books. I hate to say this, but Ferdia Shaw is quite unconvincing as an actor, and that's partly down to the rubbish script he was given as much as it is his wooden delivery. Secondly, the plot of this movie is everywhere except coherent. From plot point to plot point it's rushed to be ""exciting"" when instead it's just barely understandable, a blast of CGI after CGI with no real stakes or drama or proper characters who you even like. It's a mixture of B-movie cliches that takes this admittedly well-made fairy world and makes it entirely forgettable and generic. Humour falls flat just about every time. I'm going to quote Chris Stuckmann, who has not read the books, and who does routinely review movies like the aforementioned Onward and HTTYD, ""stunningly bad"". Josh Gad's narration was such a bore. The setup of this movie's world is ridiculously generic which results in a severe disinterest in the movie in of itself. The characters are equally boring.In order to have some touchstone to the book, you hear them say the line that he's a ""criminal mastermind"". Let's be clear. Artemis spends the movie being a very nonthreatening occasionally smart kid. On no occasion is the criminal angle ever brought up in a meaningful way. You can't have it both ways, this only furthers how atrocious the writing of this movie was.Let's get into the book argument. The premise of the books was that Artemis Fowl began as a criminal mastermind who did criminal things like blow up boats, kidnap and extort, and who eventually would have a redemption arc. By starting from the opposite direction, the writers have not only failed entirely to adapt the singular unique thing about Artemis Fowl, but also created an even more unconvincing arc than before. As mentioned already, the plot is everywhere and the stakes are artificially thrown everywhere and muddled to make it feel like something is happening.The reason why the Fowl books were good was also because the plotting was relatively tight and fast-paced. Two different arcs were squished into this 90 minute movie, making the plot incoherent, especially when compared to the original books.Yes, books will always have differences from movies and that's absolutely fine. But there is no real excuse for the writers. Namely because there are graphic novels of the original books. What does this mean? It means that an entire storyboard already exists. The hardest work is essentially done for you, by showing you a visual format of the plot, so it's easy to decide what you can film and what you can't. To then come up with a generic plot and the most ridiculous character arcs for a series which had good versions of both was stupid.Finally, let's address the ""it's a kids movie"" nonsense. Any five year old will enjoy a random mixture of colours and cool-looking creatures. This is NOT an excuse to make a shit movie. It's barely enjoyable, and let's face it, not even interesting enough to get you to consider watching another one. It isn't even as though Disney did families a favour by making this generic entertainment. The original was written for kids. Read by kids. Enjoyed by kids, who usually have a deeper appreciation of things like that than adults give them credit for. It makes zero sense that making Artemis Fowl slowly turn evil is somehow a better character arc for audiences than starting with an already somewhat evil Artemis. The characters don't fit, and anyway Shaw is highly unconvincing at being anything more than a wide-eyed kid with occasional smart moments.Enough with that nonsense to justify a high score. This is quite objectively still a bad movie. I would say 5/10 material, but the sheer audacity of the writers to destroy the original books so comprehensively despite it literally having received good reception from kids and families for years, makes this much lower.2/10.

Little do they know of the imaginative scouring that child's mind is about to receive. There were some thoughts at the time of The Two Towers movie that, despite how well Gollum was depicted on screen, there can be something said for the lost opportunity to imagine that creature for oneself. In that case I accepted it, but movies such as these squander the opportunity for minds to embellish the written fiction in a way that is meaningful to them. I would avoid letting the image of, say, Mulch and his horrifying CGI jaw taking hold as a credible depiction of the character, and for this I can only discount the movie as merely a cynical name-recognition money maker for Disney that is its own mangled Frankenstein creation quite separate from Artemis Fowl actual. 1 star.",Artemis Fowl

251,terrachild-134-804757,Far better than reviews make out!,8,21 February 2021,"Lets start with the big 4,
Farrell is playing a minor role, the set up. He is not wasted! He just isn't the lead!
Dame Judy, she is fabulous, again, not wasted. I think she has just reach a point in her career where she is more concerned with having fun with a wider diversification of characters. And why not. Love her as the grizzled old fairy military leader!
Gads, Gads has taken more than a few oddball roles, for no other reason that he had the time and like the idea, just look at that randon aussie zombie flick he did. He did kinda steal the show, but it also felt like it was all a pilot like set up for future movies or a tv series.
Branagh, I think he did a good job visually and the story unrolls nicely. But possibly aimed for the wrong age group. The dry humour seems to have gone over the heads of the american critics based on their reviews and would not be something young fans of the books would necessarily get.
This movie was a fun. But while I doubt current fans of the books will be satisified, the mythicly and visually interesting introduction to the world of Artemis Fowl is wonderful. If you haven't read the books, this will make you want to! It could easily be a jumping off point for a tv series focussed on the 3 kids while the other adult characters are elsewhere, but if required could do the occasiinal cameo.",Artemis Fowl
252,KasparD,I knew it was bad before watching it. But still I was disappointed.,1,15 June 2020,"Great story (in the book), great visuals and some descent actors. What could go wrong? Well, everything!
The story is all over the place, only held together a bit by a voice over (talk about something that might have given the makers a hint it just wasn't good enough... a good movie doesn't need a voice over to explain the viewers what's going on because they themselves can never figure it out...). The acting is pretty bad and at points it was just literally laughing out loud on how incredibly unrealistic some characters were (Judi Dench, come on! Even you can do much better!). There's no start, no climax and no ending. It's just a constant stream of unrealistic nonsense pouring out of the TV.

Badly cast on multiple levels leading to some version poor and unbelievable acting. Whomever converted the books to a film script needs to be forced to find an alternative career as the gaps and jumps were laughable. The ""hero"" goes from a precocious, whiny 12 year old to a self proclaimed master criminal in a few days with all the swagger of his co-star Colin Farrell in a Batman film.
He is without doubt the worse casting for a lead role I have ever seen 😂

Or, and I really wish they had gone this way, they should have made this a series on either of the streaming platforms.

1 minute after that and Artemis is doing air tricks on a OneWheelI unfortunately can go on like this for pretty much every minute of the movie. IT misses every single point of what made the books so well liked and why the figure of Artemis Fowl was such a breath of fresh air in Kids/YA literature. He's not a boy who does cool stuff, dreams of faeries and just happens to be smart. He's not a hero setting out to rescue his father, he's a cold, calculated, criminal mastermind who pulled a heist on the Faerie folk.I doubt anybody who was involved in this script has read more than the blurb on the back of the books or was interested in making this an actual series of movies as they completely ruined several important plot lines from the books within the first 20 minutes of the movie.I really don't have the energy to even go into the poor CGI, phoned in performances and middle of the road, crammed in Irish references.

The story though not complicated is interesting enough to hold your attention. The characters are fun to keep you occupied. The screenplay had me on 2 occasions guffaw out loud. Mostly amusing and often funny. But the delivery is the real pearl. Child actors who can actually act. Intensity that is believable and not overdone. Emotions that are understated. Presence that feels real. When I saw the sunglasses I thought 'Oh no, theyr'e going for Will Smith cool and are gonna fail' How pleasantly surprising to be wrong. It works. He does not come across as a junior James Bond. Smart but not overbearing nor overconfident. Josh Gad playing Mulch Diggums stole the film. It's the antidote to missing Robbie Coltranes Hagrid.

It had a lot of potential and we thought it was going to be really good, the high tech fairy world, the secrets of the family, the badass butler.

The characters were weird, the main character that was supposed to be a genius doesn't know what to do in situations yet continually in other scenes says he has a plan. I don't know. In simple terms; character development was not there at all, no follow through in any of the cool worlds mentioned, Very disappointing actions scenes with supposedly highly trained people doing nothing, and lastly horrible transitions to next scenes.

The director was Kenneth Branagh, and the movie starred Judi Dench, Colin Farrell, and Josh Gad. Unfortunately for both the movie and the viewing audience, this talent was wasted. Dench and Farrell gave good performances as the fairy military commander and Artemis Sr. respectively, but Josh Gad was incredibly annoying throughout the movie. He tried to do his best William Shatner impression but failed. His overacted, pretentious reading as the dwarf narrator was one of the many faults in this movie. Josh Gad was also miscast as a dwarf, mainly because of his height. The movie tried to cover it up with a series of tall dwarf jokes that consistently fail to land, like the majority of the so-called jokes. The character development was also lacking. We don't learn until the tail end of the movie that Artemis is a criminal mastermind. And, finally, the script has way too many holes. First, it never bothers to tell the audience what organization interviewed Josh Gad. How will the Fowls overcome its new media image? And, how can an effective army, which should rely on a clear and unbreakable command structure, have a captain overrule a decision of a commanding officer? Overall, 4/10 stars.

Nonso Anozie playing Butler despite a decent turn in Game if Thrones apparently can no longer act his way out of a paper bag, I got splinters from just watching, elves living in sci-fi land felt clunky and was poorly realised, and to cap it all Judi Dench one of the worlds finest actors gave what must surely be a career worst performance. Ferdia Shaw and Lara McDonnell gave creditable performances in the two lead roles of Artemis Jnr and Holly, the latter in particular and the former only when not wearing shades which took away too much expression. The second half did improve considerably (and thankfully) including some much needed humour, much of it courtesy of Josh Gad who stole many but not all of the scenes in which he appeared.

All that remains are the character's names. I was baffled at some of the choices the movie makers made here. Why give Holly some bogus reason of looking for her father or whatever when it would make more sense to use the original reason for why she came to the tree: to perform the ritual that restores her magic. This is what Artemis in the books knew and used to his advantage when capturing Holly. Instead he's just sitting there waiting because someone saw a fairy there once upon a time??Also, even if they chose not to make him a criminal (which defies the whole point of his story, but oh well...) they could at least have given him some brainpower. They could have showed his intelligence by having him decipher the book with the secrets of the fairies, as he did in the books. He managed to decode their language, which is why he knew all their secrets.It would have made sense to keep this sort of things in the movie when they were sticking to the overall plot anyway (like keeping most of the plot confined to the manor, the time freeze, the troll, Diggums; it's all there, just muddled beyond recognition and sense.)In the end, I think what I missed the most was the banter between the main characters, especially Mulch, Foaly and Holly. There were so many opportunities to use dialogue from the books, but instead the script writers decided to make their own, half-assed dialogue for no apparent reason.And lastly, don't get me started on how they butchered the two main characters, Artemis and Holly. They took away any personality that these two characters possessed, and left only empty husks in their place. Holly seems like a misplaced little girl while in the books she was always quick thinking and fearless, and Artemis is no mastermind and definitely not a criminal one. That sentence at the end of the movie just seems absurdly misplaced after the whole movie was spent trying to make Artemis into a good guy. Just some ordinary teenager who likes sports (wtf) and who only wants to save his father (in the books, his father is gone and his mother is sick with grief... here she's dead for no apparent reason). What made Artemis in the books a bit more relatable despite being a cynical child genius, was that he was completely hopeless when it came to physical endurance. He could barely bounce a ball. He was the brains while Holly and Butler was the muscle. So when the movie creators give him both brains and makes him an extremely skilled surfer, he becomes even farther removed from someone that a kid can relate to. He's seemingly perfect. Or at least, that's what the movie is trying to tell us.It has yet to show us any of that geniusness because seemingly, all the problems just solved themselves.",Artemis Fowl

If there were a way to leave negative stars, I would.I'm a mom of 3 sons who devoured the Artemis series. I have been waiting for this movie to bring those amazing characters to life since 2007, when I first cracked the cover of Artemis Fowl. I read them all aloud to my kids and as they grew, we've all revisited them. Compelling, funny, work with characters and dialogue that snap off the page.I'm an avid movie-goer who has loved Kenneth Branaugh's directing work since he took on Shakespeare in the 90s. He made the bard so accessible for millions of viewers. He's been knighted fergawdssake.Josh Gad is normally so amazingly funny and fun to watch. Judy Dench is an international treasure. WTAF is up with their voices. In a ""heart wrenching"" scene, Diggums grumbles,""Listen to the two of us, grunting at each other like a pair of hippos with a throat infection"". I clapped because that's how they both sound THE. WHOLE. MOVIE.So you start with amazing source material, give it a monstrous budget, leave it in the hands of a skilled director with shining stars and WHAT HAPPENED, DISNEY?Colfer has to be hurling. If he were dead, he'd be spinning in his grave like a powerdrill.I am the first to understand that sometimes license must be taken to establish tricky plot points. I will suspend disbelief if there is a payoff that is similar to the source material. The producers of this movie, however, put the source material in a blender, pureed it, ran it through test audiences and came up with the most unwatchable pablum I've seen on the screen.Let's spoil it up:Do you ove the Angeline redemption line, whereby Artemis' mother, so distraught that her best true love is missing and presumed dead at the hands of the Russian Mafia that she walks like a ghost in her room when she can bring herself to get out of bed?Can it. She's dead. (which would be a really tricky thing to explain when his twin brothers Becket and Myles come into play in book 6).Do you love the erudite, sharply dressed and exercise-eschewing criminal mastermind that Artemis has become as he singlehandedly carries on the family crime business and painstakingly researches fairies on his own, deciding he will catch one?Forgetaboutit. He's a surfer now, in jeans, tees and sweatshirts. He only dons a suit for the battle and they begin with him IN SCHOOL. It's a big point in the books that he's wiggled his way out of school with his genius. And Dad's in the picture from the start, force feeding him fairy lore. They crack the gnommish language completely without the fairyButler as a one-man wrecking crew (the third best martial artist in the world) who won't reveal his first name?Sooooorry. He's introduced as ""Dom or Domovoi"" by Diggums right off the bat. He's seen training martial arts only once and only kicks butt with the aid of Holly's fairy weapon.Teenaged Juliet has been inexplicably reduced to a 12-year old. I assume this is because they thought this would be a series so she could grow into the role?Diggums is now full human sized, wishing only to be a normal sized dwarf.While I loved Foaly's hair as it recalled a horse's mane, all of his snark was written out of the picture and his CGI centaur-ness didn't work visually.Opal Koboi is introduced right off the bat where she didn't appear until book 2 in the series. You never actually see anything but a cloakedHolly as a driven elf trying to prove herself capable to the demanding Commander Root as the one and only female in LEP Recon?Naw, she just wants to clear her dad's name. (Aaaand, there's no dad in any of the books for Holly - total crap) She's not at the Oak tree to perform the sacred ritual to restore her magic, but rather goes there to find her dad's badge? She has no edge.Did you find the restoring ritual interesting and cool?Hold it in your hearts, viewer because it's completely written off here.Did you like Julius Root as a curmudgeonly foil?I have no problem with casting Root as a female - but the essential anger is gone. In the books, he's called ""beetroot"" by the troops because of this epic anger. The only anger here is the audience's at having to watch this hatchet job.************The premise decimated, the 90 minutes reels out an overly expository, nonsensical flattening of the source material with zero stakes, zero chemistry, zero character development and zero heart.I so wish I could give this zero stars. Today it's at 9% on Rotten Tomatoes. I think that's a very generous mark.Pure, unadulterated junk.",Artemis Fowl

Cgi was done very well besides the troll ,judi dench appearance was a refreshing surprise and funny how they mock their voices.Dont lash out just because its not to your exact expectation. See it as an interpretation of the books.

The prospects for which should have been awesome. My drama teacher taught me that one bad performance, it's the actor, multiple and it's the director. For a start Casting director. Did you even read the whole series or just someone's knocked up precis? Artemis Fowl is supposed to be a polymath genius with charismatic presence. Think a young James Spader, not someone who looks startled at a transformation. When you are taking such a masterpiece of worldbuilding that means a lot to fans don't crucify it. I feel really sorry for the young lad cast as the lead, they really did him a disservice.

Obviously it's supposed to be a kids movie so maybe the entire thing was way out of my range but there were so many monumental failings, it's impossible to ignore after so much hype.I was under the impression Artemis Fowl (jr) was the main character. He comes across as a bit part. Judi Dench and Lara McDonnell are the headliners with Colin Farrell bringing up the rear. Perhaps a better, more experienced child actor could have been an improvement as Artemis Foul but honestly, the writing was so bad it probably made no difference, It was cliche after cliche with some embarrassing ""cool kids"" lingo chucked in to enhance the cringe factor even more.
Mechanically operated fairies that live under the sea...was that in the book ?? I swear some of the puppets were straight out of the 1982 Jim Henson catalog !

It's like Disney didn't want him to have a regular voice so kids are not like why is Olaf in this.If you are looking to put this on for your kids to keep them entertained it will do the job.

2. Fairies want an secret object that is never really explained what it is, that artemis's father has hidden in mansion
3. Fairies attack mansion to get secret object, then Artemis and faeries come to an agreement and Father is returned.
4. The End..Literally, that's all that happens. It opens by telling us how much of a genius Artemis is and yet he doesn't use his intellect in one single instance in the movie.The movie is about 1 1/2 hours long and really could have been reduced to 45 mins and the audience would still feel bored with the content presented.",Artemis Fowl

The flaw is that Disney thinks they can outwrite what was originally written by Eoin Colfer is annoying. It's like Disney doesn't even try anymore - recent movies are no more than a jumbled up story with one developed character and everyone else being thrown to the side. This movie does quite the same. I can see where they tried, but you will be disappointed if you are a fan of the original book series.
It's just Disney. I'm not surprised. Disney is now a very large company known worldwide. They don't even have to try anymore. This is an example of Disney being lazy and uninspired.
Take a look at the How To Train Your Dragon series from Dreamworks. They steered almost completely clear of the original plot and still managed to deliver. How? Because Dreamworks knows how. The plot is it's own while still being respectful to the original piece.
Disney on the other hand is almost always there for the money. The plot is lazy and is full of cliches. Don't watch if you are a fan of the original book. If you have no idea what Artemis Fowl is, give this movie a try. You might like it if I have to be honest, but for the fans, they pushed us aside once again.

A lot of the critics of this movie seem to have either read the books or expected the movie to be more adult orientated. This is a movie aimed directly at the young teen market so you can't expect it to please all the adults. As for the people who always insist on comparing movies to the books, you can't always get all the details from a book into a movie as books allow the reader to use their imagination and picture things differently than what the writer had envisaged.
Then there are the critics who say things like ""it's a confusing story line"" and ""I couldn't follow the story"", where we watching the same movie ?? I had no trouble following the story. Yes a lot of it was predictable and some of it was a bit corny, but that how these movies usually are, they are supposed to be a bit of light relief and fun. Watch it as a bit of fun and don't try and compare it to the books and you should enjoy it.

They tried to mix all the books into one and made it a difficult to comprehend racing array of pictures.The whole movie is cringe-worthy, poorly executed and without any love. It is a clear licence to make money and I hope it tanks so hard that they stop following up.
They should have just called it something else, change the names and pay Eon Culfer a bit because they stole some ideas.What was Eon Culfer, the author of the books, thinking giving this to Disney?Yes, I am angry, because this, while never the potential to become a second Harry Potter, has been an amazing book series with so much detail and love towards the characters, but they did not even care to stay true to the book a tiny bit.

The story line is practically non-existent. Characters do and say random stuff at random times and even if the story is poor it's hard to follow. It seems like more than a movie this is a bunch of CGI-heavy scenes badly glued together. The climax of the film centers around a large fight with no real threat and no actual meaning.One last word about the acting. While the grown up characters are decent, the young actors are terrible.

The plot is illogical, more a series of loosely connected events, with no real structure or purpose.The cast is largely inexperienced, and put in lacklustre performances. There are exceptions, but are either not long on screen (Colin Farrell) or miscast (Judy Dench). In the end it failed to hold my attention beyond the first 15 minutes, and I only finished it out of a sense of completeness.For fans of the books, it is even worse. Artemis has been changed out of all recognition, from a cerebral genius to a bland action hero. Rather than discover the fairy world, it was handed to him on a plate by his father.His mother is dead.Butler has been neutered, (including using his first name), Juliet has been turned into a 12 year old girl and hence made useless, and Holly goes from prisoner to partner in 10 minutes rather than several books. Turning Mulch into a 'Giant dwarf' is another awful change.Overall this is a waste of time and money. I only rated it as high as a 3 because I watched it all",Artemis Fowl

I hope they make more! Also, any of you who haven't figured out that a book series turned into a movie, will NEVER compare to the books. Harry Potter is as close as anyone has ever gotten to successfully turn a great book series into a movie franchise. So giving this movie and story line bad reviews bc it's not like the books, well, dont watch it. Go read more books. The movie its self was great. I loved it, my kids loved it and that's all that matters. Disney is not perfect. They too make duds every once in a while, however, in my opinion this was wonderful! Remember, it's for the kids and I guarantee you ""most"" children will love this movie too. Adults, well go watch something more adult. Quit crying and ruining a good movie bc it's not what ""you"" thinking should be. Good job Disney! I hope to see more Artemis Fowl movies!",Artemis Fowl

Make the movie 3 hours build a story show the butler caring for artemis jr .make artemis and holly scenes where they talk and get to know eachother . Carefully introduce the other world to people so we can grow into the magic.
Dont let artemis find the item in the first movie dont let him return his dad in movie one for people's sake dont rush everything in a hour and a half make it a 6 movie adventure with more villains more characters more dept more of the world .

Okay, first I get mixed Spy Kids feel from this movie and some random ""fancy rich superhero"" movie.Only thing what I did like in the movie was Holly Short and some visual effects. But all who did read the books can say the same, Holly Short is not real Holly Short when Commander Root is female in the movie. It takes part away from story of the Holly Short, who is L.E.P. Recon's first female officer in the book series.Seems like second part is coming.... Or is it? Fowl family goes hunt the Opal Koboi at end with Holly Short and Mulch Diggums, what ""happy ending"".So the movie takes some from the book, mixing even first and second and all the books together, taking some parts away and adding some weird stuff to plot.

The plot is somehow coerent but lacks deepness and emotion in general. I personally can't get attached to any of the characters. It's really sad how a great actress went from Bond movies to this kind of movie.

There was no tension or excitement in the movie. The tone was absolutely bland. The lead character, the boy is unlikable, as an actor but mostly as the character. He is shown to be an arrogant and conceited little brat who knows everything and is super intelligent but doesn't have respect for anybody. He walks like a goofball which shows that he isn't what the director wants to portray. In reality he is a geek who cannot act for his life. Yet somehow we are supposed to like him. His character didn't prove himself to be that genius as he did nothing special to prove his worth. The most annoying part was the continuous narration of the movie. Omg why wouldn't they stop it! Just keeps ruining the flow of the movie. And what is with the super hoarse voice of the narrator and the fairy villain. It was really irritating to hear those completely made up voices.

364,emperos_master-930-79098,My hopes were too high.,1,14 June 2020,"In the first Artemis Fowl book, even I'll admit, not very much happens. It all amounts to a novel length, day-long sting operation.What ultimately makes it work, however, is merely the complexity in simple plumbing. What makes it work is being able to see the development and thought processes of this child prodigy, and seeing how we get from his introduction to a life or death standoff between him and a magical militia (and furthermore how he succeeds in his own devious ways).In regards to the Artemis Fowl movie, I get the impression that there was someone probably higher up the creative wrung than director Kenneth Branagh (who happens to be a very competent director) who didn't trust that this franchise was strong enough to get by on merely that. It shows with how unnecessarily dense the movie was.From beginning to end, the titular Artemis Fowl is touted to be this super genius, but from memory I can only really remember him doing two or three things that displayed who he really was (if even that). The rest of the movie flew by with about an hour and twenty minutes of force fed narration (side-bar: is it just me or does Josh Gad try to upstage every movie that he is in?), elements from the sequels jammed into the plot, quite a few important plot devices thrown out the window, and ten times more than your daily dose of action that would make Michael Bay's 'Transformers' movies look bland by comparison. By all accounts, it is the cinematic equivalent of dangling keys over your baby for an hour and a half. If the movie was half an hour longer and took time to BREATHE AND REFLECT then maybe it could have worked (and also by omitting half of the inclusions).For what it's worth, I felt like the acting and overall design of the movie were really good. I didn't even mind some character changes (like Artemis being more athletic and emotional). It's only unfortunate that these details were colossally overshadowed by everything else.I'm generally very forgiving when it comes to adaptations of books because it's nearly impossible to please everybody on a good day. But it's sad when you take a step back and realize that the minutes long trailer was better than the movie it was advertising.",Artemis Fowl

It's just a bad movie that barely acknowledges the source material.For those in Ireland, the opening is even borderline insulting. Mulch is apprehended by the Irish Police (the Gardai) and is interrogated by...wait for it...British Intelligence? This would never happen in real life since Ireland won its independence from Britain quite a long time ago. This goes beyond mere stupidity to the sort of uncaring plot hole that betrays the level of care that goes into this movie. The Hill of Tara, an actual real physical place in Ireland, does not have a mysterious tree either. Sorry. As for surfing...well, let's all just agree that Disney and Geography separated during the production of Artemis Fowl :). They also separated themselves from the books.If you can ignore the plot holes, lack of consistency to the books, the coincidences, the thoroughly unconvincing presentation of Artemis' intelligence, and a few poorly executed set pieces, it's still not a complete disaster.

Why was it necessary to engineer the arrest and interrogation of Josh Gad's character? Why were humans, Artemis and co., not affected by the time freeze? Why did the lead heavy not foresee the risk that the maguffin could be used against it? And so on.In its favour, the visuals were spectacular. It did not take itself too seriously. And Josh Gad provided welcome knowing comic relief. Plus, significantly for me, I stayed awake throughout; this was not boring.Maybe the story is better suited to an episodic format to better and more comprehensively do its labyrinthine plot justice.

I've read all of the original books, and they are all very good. Great characters, ingenious plots and a central character that matures from a criminal to a hero as the books progress. In seems though that the executives at Disney wanted to make a mediocre Disney movie and destroyed all that. All they left was something that is a poor copy of the original that has no legs to stand on. It is confusing. Has another over extended and really unnecessary long battle scene and guts the original character until we are left with another Disney clone.

What impressed me was just how terribly and thoroughly they managed to botch this movie. Instead of trying to figure out what people liked about the books, it felt as though they took a bunch of random pages from the books and completely reinvented the characters to fit some random scriblings. A lot of the names are there, but the characters are off, especially Artemis. The movie version of him isn't even a pale facsimile of the book version.Now, it is entirely possible to adapt a book and completely change everything about it and still stay true to the spirit of the books or to at least make a good movie even if it's nothing like the books. However, this movie fails just as a movie. It is an absolute mess. It felt as though they took a 4 hour movie and randomly removed 2.5 hours from it. We go from Holly wanting to do terrible things to Artemis to being best buddies with him in like 5 minutes for no reason at all. Character development and motivations are just tossed. There is no coherent flow to this movie.On top of that, we get this really terrible narration by Josh Gad doing his best Batman impersonation (Judi Dench does hers as well). The problem with the narration is that it is extremely transparent that it's there to tell us what is going on and why and who these characters are because otherwise we'd have no idea that Butler is supposed to be a big badass (never shown in the movie) or that Artemis is this criminal mastermind/genius (not really shown in the movie either - Artemis is significantly more of a passive participant than he is in the books where he's a driving force of action) or any of a bunch of other things that could have been relayed to us in a more interesting way. I also can't help but think that maybe they thought the target audience was filled with morons and needed things spoon-fed to us.As a family, we listened to these books while driving to and from Glacier National Park a couple years ago. My son, who is 12, was so excited for this movie. It was a major reason why we signed up for Disney+. I knew beforehand that this movie had significant issues, so I tried to gently tamp down expectations. He said he enjoyed the movie, but I have no doubt that he was both disappointed and confused as to why this movie only superficially bears any resemblance to the books.It is stunning to me that they managed to make such an incompetent movie, especially when you had someone experienced like Kenneth Branagh at the helm.

387,rainbowzs,"A teen action movie with the fairy world, but the teen is not Artemis.",4,14 June 2020,"I love movies. I love books. I love Disney. So I had high hopes when Disney made a movie from a book series I liked. What could go wrong? A lot, apparently.
I don't need the movie to be a carbon copy of the book to like it. Some stuff that works in books does not work on screen and movies can create the visual spectacular and action sequence that books can't do as well. Problem is when they choose to make a movie based on a book, take the heart of the story and then completely mangle it. Disney could have taken a perfectly good recipe and turn it into gold, even create their own storyline for Artemis's next adventure, but they choose to remove what makes the books a classic which are the characters and how they develop.
I quickly realised in the first 10 minutes that it's not going to be at all like the book. Visually, it's great. Ireland is beautiful. Haven is suitably high-tech. The action sequence is fun. They changed the characters and some of it works. Foaly is now a snappy dresser. Root is Judi Dench, but hey, why not? Mulch is funny and now a giant dwarf (guess they really really want Josh Gad to play it and then ran out of money to make him small). They made Butler and Artemis Sr more people-friendly and family-oriented, which I guess I can let go. Holly Short now has a backstory.
Koboi is apparently Darth Vader now (so not a surprise if she is going to be Artemis' mother or closely related to it) because you know, let's make it really obvious she's a villain... a cute girly pixie apparently just doesn't cut it.
Main problem is Artemis is just not Artemis in this Disney version, and it's very difficult to move away from that if you've read and loved the books. In the books, Artemis was a gazillionaire genius kid, super-formal and exacting but socially awkward and clumsy, who is also a loyal brilliant strategist and mastermind trying to save his father, then mother, then the fairy world. Disney mixed a bit of Alex Rider in and deleted quite a bit of Artemis Fowl and made him a gazillionaire supersmart rude teen, who can now fight and shoot, trying to save his father. So like any other teen action movie, with leprechauns, fairies, dwarfs and trolls thrown in.
It's probably a good movie for young kids, who don't care for dialogue or character development, and like pretty pictures on screen. Probably not if the kid is a fan of the book and the characters.

Now before going into the review, let's point out that Disney managed to bring the film out of development hell, so you should at least give them some credit for trying.Pros: The Visuals were stunning, it had excellent acting from supporting actors, it also had an understanding relationship between humanity and the mystical beings that are in hiding (Even though it was horribly explained).Cons: The over reliance on visuals made the film seem fake at some parts. I understand that the studio did everything they could to make a fantastic film, but they spent too much money on visuals, too little on a compelling plot. Just because a film is filled with state of the art visuals doesn't mean it will garantee a financial and critical success. Ahem, Transformers and its sequels. The main protagonist was just annoying, and I mean he cannot act annoying. When I rewatched the film, I skipped every scene that heavily focused on the main character. Keep in mind, it's a 1.5 hour film, and that didn't even help it. The other actors did a great job. Bravo! They were great in the film. The plot is also spliced from two books in the series, making the film into a convoluted mess. I can tell a lot was cut on the editing floor, and while editing a really long film can help make it a critical darling, depending on what gets cut out, whoever edited this film did terrible. The editors did worse than those on Transformers: The Last Knight. And that is not a good sign. The series is also gritty and dark, not exactly the Disney route. They shouldn't have made the film to begin with. Hopefully this taught Disney a lesson, if they want to make a dark and gritty book series into a franchise in the foreseeable future.I really wanted to like the film, but it was so bad.Also, the Pandemic didn't really help the film as well, which would not have really done any damage to the film because of how bad it is, but it did help Disney financially by having it on Disney+. Good Job on them for that.",Artemis Fowl
392,cancer-boy,What the hell?,4,10 November 2020,"For a company like Disney to destroy a storyline is nothing new. Next time, take a couple of weeks to actually study the books. Nake notes and stay true to it.
I get that some things must change to fit the entire thing in to a movie. Harry Potter was a huge success (I hate J. K. Rowling for the bigot she is), this could have been too had they made the effort.",Artemis Fowl
393,ultramangaia21,No hate here.,8,13 June 2020,I know nothing about the book because I don't have time to read books. I've always been a movie fan so I went into the movie only seeing the trailer and nothing else about the film. That being said I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you haven't read the book and enjoy fantasy/adventurer you may enjoy it. I'm over 30 to clarify that I'm adult.,Artemis Fowl
394,Frixcon,Just.. why?,3,14 June 2020,"Kenneth Branagh; Why on earth would you adapt a book into a movie, if you're going to completely ignore the book? It's popular for a reason; and if you feel the need to change everything that makes that book and its' characters what they are; then this simply wasn't the project for you to begin with.You'd think that for a story about a magical world you'd get some type of pretty, epic adventure. Somehow they made this movie feel so ridiculously 'small', as about 80% of the movie literally just takes place in the same house.This movie honestly makes me worried about the new Percy Jackson series that's coming to Disney+. You'd think they'd know how to do a proper adaptation in 2020. Shame.",Artemis Fowl

Incoherent, inconsistent and confusing mess of a story. If you skipped the 1st half of the film nothing would have changed for you. No character development, inauthentic acting, terrible casting, the list can go on and on. There was absolutely nothing good about the movie.And why on earth did they let a 5 year old do the camera work for the film?!",Artemis Fowl

399,martin_luzu,There is one good reason I can rate this movie 10 stars,10,13 June 2020,"I loved the movie, because I saw it as a child, without expecting anything at all. A child whose heroes were on the screen, like that time you saw Santa Claus on the tv.It was severely flawed, on not being able to make audience feel what they should feel on each situation, by developing an extremely superficial fast-paced tornado of a confusing altered plot.But I watched it with my inner child, the one who doesn't judge if it's father who puts the beard on and the red hat to give me presents.This movie is a gift, and I'm grateful for it. I'll watch it happily until I get the remake.Hope my review helps.I gave it a 10/10 for the feelings I have felt when I watched the movie, as a fan of the Artemis Fowl series of books who waited for 20 years for this. Objectively, I would give the movie a 7/10 being kind, and a 4/10 being mean. 7 would be just right though.The thing is, the real problem with the movie is it's too fast paced. They tried to push two and a half books into one movie and they were way too rich to do it this way. Other than that, the plot is way different and some of the characters are way out of character, which makes it hurtful for less understanding fans, which is not my case.But you've probably have read too many rants and hate towards the movie, so I will state the very brilliant points of it, which makes it a great movie despite its flaws.1) The actings are fantastic, all of them. Despite the screenplay which made them feel out of character, they did an amazing job with what they had.2) The visuals are marvelous. I absolutely couldn't have expected anything better, and it exceded my expectations entirely and by far. I am very happy with what I saw. Wonderful science fiction visuals.3) Make up and the clothing was brilliant. I can't ask for anything better.4) Cinematography and photography is amazing.5) As a fan of AF, I watched it as a ""parallel universe"", since it was different to the real (and much better) plot of the books, and was satisfied with the altered plot.Now the 3 main flaws which made the movie be a 4 star movie instead of a decent 8 star one:1) Extremely fast paced that pushes way too many interesting things in seconds, so nobody can fully immerse on this new fairy world thus making something otherwise brilliant feel superficial and lame2) A screenplay favoring out of character acting3) Ok, I'll say it. The book plot was tremendously better.I really enjoyed watching a decent movie of my main childhood book series and I'll watch it at least 20 more times this week. I hope on some miracle there comes a second one -or even better: a remake.",Artemis Fowl
400,jsne16102,Why can't they leave a classic alone??,4,13 June 2020,"I really thought Disney would know better. Look at the real successes like Harry potter, Lord of the rings etc. What do they have in common? they stick to the story that the extremely gifted authors wrote. That is what captured peoples imagination. they stuck to the original and added great artistic special effects, inspired Direction and the right talents doing the acting. This movie tried to get by on its name, one great actress, and special effects. They sacrificed the magical element that the author had inspired and produced a predictable piece of high calorie, sugary rubbish that's been shoved out so many times before. We, the thinking public look for the translation of our beloved classics to be as true to the story as is possible and enhanced by the producers not just an expensive light show.",Artemis Fowl

408,zanderdoring,"""Artemis Fowl"" is Truly Fowl",1,19 June 2020,"I am going to start off this review by being quite blunt; in my most sincerest of opinions, ""Artemis Fowl"" is quite possibly the worst Disney movie ever produced. I am confident that there has to be a direct-to-DVD movie that is objectively worse than ""Artemis Fowl"", but the fact that the latter is a big budget release and is comparable to the former is honestly baffling to me. ""Artemis Fowl"" is atrocious in every capacity and quite literally in every aspect; from the character's bland and uninteresting development and general lack of intrigue, to the scarcity of unique and interesting locations, to the failed captivation of the mysterious villain who, by the way, is only seen in three scenes, all of which very concise and underwhelming. What I cannot fathom as well is the story's own premise; like why does every character in this movie want the McGuffin? Unfortunately, we as audience members never quite get to find out this necessary bit of information because ""Artemis Fowl"" insists on going at break-neck pace, meaning that nothing gets sufficiently explained and nothing gets sufficiently developed, including the characters. What is even more perplexing is the fact that ""Artemis Fowl"" is so boring, despite the fact that so much happens at an incredible speed. Overall, ""Artemis Fowl"" is an F and a generous 1/10.",Artemis Fowl

The dwarf kept saying that Artemis Fowl is brilliant, and from the books we know that he is. But in the movie he did nothing brilliant. The story was all over the place, I don't even understand why the characters started trusting each other.
I didn't give this movie the worst possible rating because I know that I'm not the target audience, and kids may actually enjoy it.",Artemis Fowl
410,simonrosenbaum-11970,Thoroughly Entertaining! (honestly),8,2 January 2021,I understand that if you've read the books you might be disappointed but for those you haven't then this is a very enjoyable and entertaining film. I would ignore all the ridiculous 1 star reviews and the anti Disney brigade. Very few films deserve to get 1 star and this is certainly not one of them. I thought the young cast were charming and perfect for this type of film. I especially liked Judi dench as you've never seen her before. Unless you have huge unrealistic expectations you will enjoy this film. It's a great family film that Disney have been doing for the last 70+ years.,Artemis Fowl
411,jpcfunk,Not great... Not horrible,6,13 June 2020,It wasn't as good as the book although I never read the book. You know how I know that it wasn't as good as the book then? Because they're NEVER as good as the book. I can't believe people still go into movies expecting them to be like the book. Worse thing to put in a review... Ever!There are a lot of holes in this movie from an adult perspective but the way I see it this is a kids movie and I think kids are going to enjoy it. It doesn't seem to do what so many Disney movies do these days and try to cater to both adults and kids. It's all for the kids and there's nothing wrong with that.Acting was ehhhh... Special effects were ehhhh... It looks like it was filmed with 3D in mind and I would have enjoyed seeing the world they created with the depth of 3D.All that being said I didn't regret the hour and a half I spent watching it. I still have a little kid left in me. Sure there's better out there... But being locked up for this pandemic for the last 3 months I can tell you I've watched many that were worse. Don't expect the book... Don't expect an academy award... Just stick the kids in front of the TV for an hour and a half and have a glass of wine.,Artemis Fowl

No suspense, no character building, illogical moments... It could have been an Harry Potter franchise if I read all the positive reviews about the books. But the movie sucks big time. This is what I made up from the movie after watching it forcefully spread over three nights (spoilers alert!):Super smart rich arrogant surfdude kid Artemis, with no mother, learns that the stories from his father about a secret fantasy world of elves, trolls, kobolts, etc are not just stories. His father is kidnapped by some bad guy in a cave, whom wants some magic weapon thing, that is important as the sun, as ransom within 24 hours from Artemis. Artemis has a mastermind briljant plan: he kidnapps an Elf that by coincidence is on the right time on the right place and is also the daughter of the elf that the father of Artemis knows really good. What are the odds?! They become best friends (Stockholm syndrome maybe?!) An whole fleet of elves come to rescue the elf by:1. Creating a time loop thing around the house that eats elves?!
2. Sending in a dwarf that steals the magic thing from Artemis his own house (?!) and gives it to Artemis because they are also suddenly best buddies.
3. Sending in a troll that destroys everything in his path. Also the elf they came to rescue could die by it.They defeat the troll.

It felt very rushed and not enough time were spent to explain things.The effects were nice, as modern movies cand make. Its Disney after all.Personalitywise, Artemis Fowl felt nothing like the books, too geeky somehow. Don´t know if its because of the actor or the script, but he has to have a more arrogant personality.

What we got - Spy Kids franchise wannabeThis film is absolutely one of the worst adaptations I've ever seen, in fact - its not even really an adaption - instead it reads like someone skimmed the Wikipedia article of Artemis Fowl (the plain English film), then proceeded to binge watch the Spy Kid films before writing this. In case its not clear, I am a big fan of the books, I grew up with them to an extent, I should also be clear that I guess young kids are the target market, but anyway, let the salt begin!The Characters
Artemis FowlWhat he should be: Evil, almost always in a suit and always in controlWhat is he in the film? Irremediably ruined, seen surfing on the Irish waves in the first few moments, turned into a bland kid who is introduced to fairies by his daddy, has no rapport with Butler, seen engaging in hand to hand combat with fairies, takes his sunglasses off and calls Holly a friend in no time.
Character Assassination marks - 10/10ButlerWhat he should be: Suited, booted, awesome, the ultimate bodyguardWhat is he in the film? Irremediably ruined, race-blended for some reason, hardly effective in any scene, holds no human weaponry throughout the entirety of the film, seen crying in several scenes, hugs Artemis Fowl, FML...
Character Assassination marks - 10/10HollyWhat she should be: The first LEP female officerWhat she is in the film? Not the first LEP female officer, has a dumb side-story about her father betraying her people, does not use an awesome LEP gun, constantly looks aimless and stupid, scenes of her flying and saluting are the dumbest thing, calls Artemis Fowl friend, oh make it stop...
Character Assassination marks - 9/10Commander RootWhat HE should be: Cigar chewing police boss with a mean attitude and a secret heart of goldWhat he is the film: The magnificent dame Judi Dench doing a hilarious Irish accent and wearing emerald green, never smokes a cigar.
Character Assassination marks - 12/10Other CharactersFoley - Should be the fairy version of Q, brilliant, paranoid and seen wearing a tin-foil hat. Is none of these things but watching the centaur effects had mean in gales of laughter.
Mulch Diggums - A completely unnecessary narrator but probably the most accurately captured character from the books. Character Assassination marks - 6/10
Briar Cudgeon - I'm not going to either bother
Artemis Fowl Snr - Colin Farrall as the doting father and art-collector who teaches little Arty-Warty all about the fairies and the people. Does not get kidnapped by the Russian mafia in the Bay of Kola. Is most certainly not a criminal mastermind
Juliet Butler - 21 in the books and generally awesome. Race-bended, turned into a teen side-kick and useless for the movie purposes except the demographics.
Angeline Fowl - A crucially important character from the book, completely AWOL in this adaptionWhat else is not in the film?
A cool opening in VietnamThe Fairy BookAcornsMagic (lets be fair, its hardly in it)'I don't even like lollipops'Butler in a suit of amour with a mace taking on a troll (among many other things)Criminal mastermindsGuns, explosions,I digress, but at least they added a magical magufin (the AXIOM) which everyone is after, and loads of fancy CGI (some of it quite stylish and cool), the time stop is initially cool but I don't really 'get' what is going on at the end, its very stupid and confusing (I mean, forget how cool and technical it is in the book, remember Santa?).I'm exhausted now, I can't wait for the YouTube videos covering this, bravo Disney, you took a beloved franchise with great potential for smart, family entertainment and trashed it so completely it will be remembered only along with the other stalwarts of Eragon, Last Airbender, Hungry Cities and so forth.",Artemis Fowl

This is a blatant (not even) mediocre hollywood production looking like it's been made in the 90s with a really low budget (though some designs look quite nice but that's not enough to watch this movie). Kenneth Branagh assaults (once more) the original piece of art and makes it absolutely preposterous.

The Last Airbender movie is more accurate than this movie and Percy Jackson and Eragon are spot on in comparison. Literally the only things they got right are the character's names, that fairies exist and it was set in Ireland. I do have to admit the trailer made it look even worse, at least the like middle 1/3 kind of sort of followed the general plot of the first book before they went on about some artifact that didn't exist in the books at all...There were several things they got fundamentally wrong, Artemis's personality was completely wrong like he went surfing? Lol. Commander Root was turned into a woman which does not work at all because Holly was supposed to be the first female LEPRecon officer... In fact there were also a bunch more female officers. The whole thing with his father was basically like wtf? That was not at all what his father was like in the books.Even assuming this was a brand new movie and not an adaptation the movie was just OK, not great or anything it would probably be a 4 or a 5 if it was not a terrible book adaptation.",Artemis Fowl

Though a lot of comments say its a kids movie, as an adult I think it's very enjoyable. A lot of fun tech that I did not expect. The volcano travel pod, the time freeze device, the fairy wings.. love to get one of those :).
Ofc a lot of things were reminding me of other movies. E.g. the draf giganticus looked a lot like Hagrid... and a lot of the magical creatures looked like they stepped out of other fantasy/sf movies.
The cast was also good. Especially Holly is my idea of an elf and she played the role very good. The other characters are also well cast.
There is some criticism though. Although the story seemed to be told in the end, some parts feel rushed and cut short. Some scenes are okay, some too long and some too short. I think The film cut could have used some more balance.Al-in-all still very entertaining. My rating 9",Artemis Fowl

But they changed all the key plot points of the story we love, and I found the new plot a bit difficult to sink my teeth into. It has the characters we love, but the changes are difficult to accept. Why not make the movie FROM THE BOOK? The suave coolness and sheer genius of Artemis, that mystery and wonder that I felt reading the first book of ""who is this kid!?!?"" - it was absolutely deflated by the movie introducing him as just a kid trying to figure out what happened to his dad who by the way left just like yesterday. And meanwhile Josh Gad as Mulch is giving a step by step play by play narrative which is supremely unnecessary and a bit awkward. But again...it LOOKS so good, which almost makes it worse because I'm just finding myself supremely upset at the lack of realized potential that it could have been.",Artemis Fowl

443,tclemans,Anticlimactic and dull,2,15 June 2020,"This movie sucked hard. The ""genius"" main character shows very little intelligence but plenty of overconfidence. The backstory was underdeveloped to the relationship between the two worlds and the characters have no real reason to work together. The villain is essentially a gruff voice and weak threats. The movie shows no real reason why Artemis and Holly would trust each other enough to work together. It was just like ""Do you trust me? Let's be friends forever."" even though they'd never met and didn't know about each other's parents until after they agreed to work together.

447,malachinutter,I Feel Bad For Eoin Colfer,1,13 June 2020,"Well, the costume designs were okay; and the actors who played Artemis and Holly weren't terrible choices (although I feel like they should have aged Artemis up to being 15-16 or waited until these actors were a bit older), but those are really the only positive things I can say about this movie. Stuff from the books happens, but it's buried under a bunch of unnecessary and bad changes and twisted around to the point that it's close to nonsensical. This was a great book series and there was a point when I was younger that I even considered it my favorite book series ever; but it's so altered and watered down here that it loses everything that made the series good. Artemis Fowl's character arc from villain to hero was great and probably the first arc like it that I saw in a series as a kid; but here he comes across like a ripoff Harry Potter with all character development and nuance cast aside in favour of a blatantly heroic protagonist. Kenneth Branagh is great at acting and he can do faithful adaptations (such as his awesome and incredibly faithful version of Hamlet), but it seems like he either didn't put any effort into this movie, or he just thought that having the title character start off as a villain would be too hard for kids to understand, so he made a watered down version of what was a reasonably complex story (at least in terms of childrens and young adults literature). Or maybe it's all Disney's fault and not his, I don't know. Regardless, this is garbage and I feel bad for Eoin Colfer. I know some people were able to enjoy it and so I guess good for them, but I doubt many of those people would still enjoy it if they read the book version.
The Percy Jackson movies were more faithful adaptations than this, honestly.",Artemis Fowl

450,tao-58694,A terrible movie and an even worse adaptation,1,15 June 2020,"As a movie, this would probably be a 4/10 for me. There's some decent visuals but its storyline is messy and confusing, characters are impossible to care about and the dialogue is very awkward. If you've never read or don't care about the books, this one should be avoided unless you're watching it with a child.Reviewing this as a nostalgic lover of the books though...just don't watch this. It's not worth the curiosity. They took the first two books, smashed them together with a hammer, blended them, and crapped out this movie, served with a huge helping of Random Unnecessary Plot McGuffin. Almost every scene is taken from one of the two books, but altered to be more confusing, dumb and frustrating than anything from Colfer. They don't really explain how anything works. Fairy magic is barely explained (or even used, other than healing), the Rules are brushed over extremely quickly and they keep alluding to the battle between fairies and humans without actually explaining what happened. Then there's the Aculos, a completely random magical device with absolutely no defined power that turns out to have been in Fowl Manor all along and Holly uses it perfectly to solve all the conflicts in the movie with no problems. And somehow thats not even the worst part. The characters are downright atrocious. Artemis isnt even a criminal (and also athletic for some dumb reason), his dad knows about faires and works with them to save the world, his mother is just dead, Holly is focused on redeeming her father who worked with Artemis' dad, Mulch is the most annoying and unneeded narrator ever, Root is decent but doesn't do much, Butler is just kind of there and Juliet and Foaly barely exist. Opal Koboi is supposedly behind everything but all you see is a shadow with a 3-pack-a-day voice who never does anything in the story besides be a totally generic villain who hardly ever is onscreen and barely interacts with the rest of the cast. Definitely one of the worst book adaptations I've seen, if not the absolute worst",Artemis Fowl

When making a movie based on a book, there are liberties that have to be taken because some things can't translate from the book and some effects (like the size of the fairies) are a hard to produce without costly CGI. However this movie doesn't seem to care about using CGI, and even uses it effectively but uses it in all the wrong places. The biggest issue with this movie is not the complete changing of story line but the betrayal of every single character's base traits for what appears to be no real reason.

468,chitoryu15,Was this a prank?,1,12 June 2020,"Imagine, if you will, a film adaptation of a popular book that decides to make everything the opposite of how it is in the book. Now decide for yourself if that's the best idea you've had. Have you been drinking? You've probably been drinking.Gone is the calculating genius Artemis Fowl, so physically scrawny that he can barely climb a ladder without hurting himself and speaking like an adult to the extent that he creeps people out. Gone is Artemis as a criminal mastermind arranging for the kidnapping of a fairy for ransom.Instead, this Artemis has no idea that he's from a line of criminals. His FATHER is the one who believes in fairies, in fact, and he despite being a genius (he cloned a goat when he was 10!) he doesn't learn that his father is rumored to be a master thief until he hears about it on the news. Butler (who is now very insistent that he be called ""Domovoi"" or ""Dom"" and never be called ""Butler"") ends up being the one to tell him about the world of fairies and his father's research! He's also quite athletic and engages in two fight scenes.The plot about the ransom is mutilated through the kidnapping of Fowl Sr. and the addition of a new MacGuffin stolen from the fairies that Opal Koboi (who wears a veil and voice changer through the entire movie) wants to destroy humanity. LEPrecon is involved in the search for it as well, so the entire kidnapping plot is just a sort of misunderstanding now.There's strong evidence of massive changes to the plot; narration by Mulch Diggums (a rasping Josh Gad imitating Hagrid) as a framing device is necessary to keep it from being utterly incomprehensible, and there are still so many unexplained events and reveals of knowledge that it feels like vital scenes are simply missing, or that the same scene shot with two different scripts was badly stitched together. At one point you can see Opal's mouth just enough to tell that the actress was saying something entirely different in her monologue and has been dubbed over.The characters are almost all nothing like their book counterparts. The scene of Butler (now joined by Action Artemis) fighting off the LEPrecon squad is shot and edited in a nauseating way with extreme ramping and bizarre choices of angles and violations of physics that make it seem like something from Spy Kids. There are questionable choices regarding CGI and green screen. I'm still not entirely sure how the ending actually occurred.This movie feels like it was made out of spite, out of hatred for the Fowl fandom.

And the changes they did make don't bother me.I think the plan that the team had behind the movie was for this first film to be an origin story for Artemis becoming evil. The Ho Chi Minh scene (which is available in the extras tab) was going to be the scene that shows the audience that Artemis is willing to do whatever it takes to get to his goals. My major point was that if this was to become a franchise of movies, Artemis would be more similar to his book counterpart in future movies.IMO, you have to take the book and movie and look at it as 2 different ways to tell a similar story.Since it has had such a negative reaction, I'm disappointed that the chances of a sequel being greenlit is very low.",Artemis Fowl

481,JoshBertie,Pretty bad...,1,17 June 2020,"This movie really wasn't the best and felt quite rushed and had so much more potential so I'm going to try and keep this as short as possible but I do have to go over so many things so I will therefore bullet point these things with an explanation to why I have listed them.Acting:Artemis Foul/ The main character:
The acting in this film was just plain awful in my opinion. It all just felt too forced from more or less, every character. The main boy just showed no emotion and just sounded monotone throughout the entire film. Now I understand that the child is young and acting is extremely hard especially playing this type of role and I do not want to seem like I'm blasting a child's performance but there are younger actors who can preform well beyond this such as the entire cast of the comedy Good Boys or even one of the main boys from that film, Jacob Tremblay and his performance in films such as Wonder or Room. Now the film Stormbreaker didn't really smash the box office but Alex Pettyfers acting in the film is how this kid should have acted in Atermis Foul. Alex actually showed emotion and facial expressions which made you connect more with the character and felt like you was watching a film rather than what seemed like a fan made film or trailer.Domovoi/Butler:
This character was just naff, he tried so hard to be the big tough bad ass but it just failed especially during scenes that was meant to be funny or heartfelt. I seemed like he was trying to hard to be the type of character that Dave Bautista played in GotG or the secret agent from Lilo and Stitch. You know, the character that is just completely bad ass and seems like the rough and tough character but when they do something that doesn't fit that role it's either really funny or actually quite sweet but this is because the characters don't force either or these things on you and it's all natural where as this actor and the character just tried to hard to make you think he was the guy made of steel with no emotions then tried to force these comedic or emotional scenes onto you.Now the only 2 characters that were any sort of decent were the higher up celebrities such as Josh Gad or Colin Farrell but even these were mediocre at best. I think I chuckled twice at Gad's character but other than that it was poor. The constant narrating by Gad was just annoying, distracting and got a bit repetitive with the constant play on how ""cool"" Artemis was and how he was the best, to be honest this all felt like the little movies you get playing on the small TV's while waiting in a line for a horror/scary rollercoaster or those interactive horror mazes. Every time one of these scenes ended and Gad finished narrating I felt like it was time to go into the next room. Also must point out that Dame Judi Dench must be at the lowest of the low after Cats and now this, to put it blunt, she was awful and honestly just seemed like she did not want to be there or in the movie at all.The plot: (potential spoilers)
Now this is based only on the film and nothing to do with the book.
The plot was...meh...it felt a tad rushed and got boring throughout the majority of the film if I'm honest and my partner felt the same. Now the effects in the film weren't too bad at all and was probably the main reason I continued to watch as they were impressive it was just a shame the story was a bit...slow? I think that's probably the best way to describe it. There was quite some action but it felt like instead of this Artemis character actually doing anything that would deem him a cool action hero, they just forced that he was this kind of character by telling you he was. It seemed every time he done something, they had to focus on this and add some slow motion like when he drops a glass of milk for instance. But he falls short of the hero by getting his butler killed (more or less), taking his sweet time killing that massive troll and nearly failing to rescue his father on time. All in all, I did not enjoy the film and I felt like it was just slow, quite boring and the acting was terrible. Could see this becoming a more serious, mature Netflix series over time which would put this to complete shame. Ah well each to their own.",Artemis Fowl
482,bdenotter,Why was this not a series?,4,8 July 2020,"So much stuff is crammed in 1.36 hours. Characters start to call each other and care for each other without having a proper introduction with each other, let alone with the audience. I feel this movie could have been a lot better as an 8-episode series. The pacing could be spread out a lot more giving all characters more time to develop.Acting was fine overall, I liked Josh Gad's performance and Collin Farrell is always a pleasure to see on stage. Judy Dench was fine but her voice was annoyingly garvely for some reason. The only one I really had problems with was the kid playing Artemis as his performance was terrible.Overall not recommended.

There was no character or real story development, it felt completely lacking of any solid information. The whole film felt like it had no grasp.My husband hasn't read the books and was looking forward to the movie just for how excited I made it sound. Now he has no idea what any of the fuss was about and still doesn't know anything about the world of Artemis Fowl now. I honestly don't either!",Artemis Fowl

The characters were good for most part.

Put the extra 45 minutes into the movie where you actually have a fight with the villain and they go get the dad, not just have him magically beam home, to set up a 15 min cliff hanger.

The story is pretty straightforward except they try to include so many different plotlines and it makes it hard to know what's happening. But the acting is good right? The young actor who plays Artemis is clearly a newbie. He tries his best but just doesn't sell it. Josh Gad as well. Usually I like Gad's performances, but in this film he really made me uncomfortable(one scene in particular). The way he talks to the camera is just unsettling and really irks me. The reason I gave it a 4 because it isn't as bad as others say it is. It still has the same charm as other movies, but it just should've never been made after all the misfires and delays ot went through.",Artemis Fowl

504,daramulhern,An enjoyable tale for one who never read the books,7,26 June 2020,I enjoyed watching this with the family and the story was very fast-paced and entertaining. Never read the books nor was even aware of them but it feels that there is a sustained negative campaign against this film. It's no masterpiece but the reviews seem to be a result of very disappointed fans. Based on this it is very unlikely there will be a sequel which is disappointing as the movie needed to set the scene of this world which was quite a task. The film was good family entertainment and left me wanting to know more about this new world.,Artemis Fowl
505,KevinYamagata,No way!,4,25 September 2020,"I can't understand how Disney could have made such a bad film.
Assuming that I have not read any books, let's start.
The story had good premises. However, the movie couldn't just make sense of anything. The frenetic speed with which the scenes follow one another and the disorder in which they are shown are just some of the negative peculiarities of this film.
The interpretation of the characters is not that great, even if I don't consider this since a good part of the actors are just kids.
I didn't understand the need to introduce a character like Juliet Butler, who was not taken into consideration during all the film.
In short, a very confusing film despite having a very simple basic plot.
I don't recommend this movie.

-pretty sets & scenesCons:
-weak acting, character breaks (ex: Mulch assumes his native, non gruff voice while being processed for prison, Juliet's name is called out by Holly while fighting troll--although they've never met)
-failed character attributes (Juliet is proclaimed a proficient fighter, but is ignored much of the home invasion and relegated to fleeing and screaming)
-forced diversity (Foaly's literal prancing)While I did not read the books, this still feels like a horrid mash of material that fails to convey an enjoyable plot. One can have over the top characters, and they can be well done: Pratchett's films and series like The Watch and Hogfather.Fitting Disney recommends I now watch A Wrinkle in Time.",Artemis Fowl

I was hoping for this movie to be at least palatable for me and my wife to watch too, but how wrong can you get? I'm sure my sentiments are echoed in other reviews, but given the talent involved in this production, it really should have been a winner and this certainly does not warrant a sequel of any sort. The boy playing Artemis was just not up to the job, which is not his fault at all, but the casting director should never work again in my opinion.
I love Kenny and Dame Judy Stench usually, but they should hang their heads in shame for being involved in this travesty.

I even liked the Harry Potter style magic and theme. If you are expecting adult story lines with flash backs and lots of fighting then go see another movie. This one is good clean fun.... NO CUSSING and I love that. It's sad when something this good gets torn up by pompous idiots that think the author might not have approved or some deep dive into the characters.

I couldn't even finish it - was too upsetting how far Disney and Conor McPherson (maybe Branagh too depending on his level of involvement with the script development) deviated from the series.With the exception of Colin Farrel who I could accept as being cast as Fowl senior, there's nothing good to be said of the cast as far as I watched. Mulch Diggums actor was horrible narrating and was poorly cast. Plus Diggums is a dwarf and should be smaller than Artemis.The worst casting is Butlerwho is large in stature and for and most important EURASIAN. Russian-Japanese to be specific. If they couldn't find someone to fit the exact bill then cast a large Russian or a Japanese actor.There's so much more wrong with it.I recommend listen to the audiobooks narrated by Nathaniel Parker who is brilliant at bringing all these characters to life.

We've never read the books, but I imagine they are much better. What a waste of a budget. The movie felt like it had potential but derailed itself at every turn. I'm not sure what's going on with Disney lately, but someone needs to step in and remind them how to make dynamic and adventurous movies Without shortchanging the details.

This is the second: WHY?! How did this get made? Did they read the books? I mean, any part of any book? We kept watching in the hopes it would improve. Obviously, that didn't happen. Disney is so fortunate that covid hit because this would have been a total box office bomb. The ""story"" was all of the place. There was no reason to care about any of the characters. Especially the character of Artemis. He is such an arrogant jerk through out. Stuff happens here, just because. There's no explanation as to what going on other than they ""tell"" us that it is. It is so completely absurd that I may have hurt myself rolling my eyes so much. Case and point: When Artemis' father gets kidnapped, Artemis figured out that clues must be in this journal because of a bedtime story that his dad reads to him every night. (Not past tense, present tense) But just before that, we are told that the dad is almost always away...Point number two: We are told that Artemis is a genius and never actually shown that he is. There is no lead up to this claim. Which in turn, makes him out to be this pretentious, condescending, know-it-all. Last point: How and why does the digger dig into the ground only to reach the second floor and arbitrarily find the safe?? Ugh!!! There are plenty more - tonnes more.

531,falah-143,Trash!,1,12 June 2020,"We saw this coming a long time ago. It is clear that, disney is borrowing just the lore from the books, but not adapting it. It had a great potential for becoming great, with a lot of good source material and a very huge following for the books. but, this looks and feels like a disney TV movie. I don't know what all went into play, but this one should have never been a childish movie. It could have been made in to a much pretentiously dark and goosebump ride.
OK, lets forget the source material and talk just about the film.
The generic soundtrack is totally forgettable, there is no artemis fowl theme that excite us. All that we think is that at least 'A Wrinkle In Time' had a good-ish soundtrack.
The script is too shallow. When it's trying to surprise us, It announces ""hey we're going to surprise you"", this keeps happening again and again.
The fact that Artemis is a genius is not shown but spoken throughout repeatedly.
Even the cinematography is muddled and fails to keep us in focus.
And when the dust settles, our hero walk to the camera in slow motion out of nowhere to sell us that he has evolved into a genius criminal mastermind, and how do we know that, because he spells it out for us.
Branagh uses all the slo-mos and cgi to sell us the next harry potter franchise, but with no heart, just poor lazy effort.
But I'm sure even Branagh let out a sigh after watching the end product because this one is dead on arrival.
Remember how harry potter books became a staple for children after the movies, this is going to do the opposite because,
1, This will be forgotten by next week because there are better memes than this to spent time on,

And I'm glad I did because it was a pretty great film.I went into this not knowing what exactly I was getting into, but within the first 10-15 minutes I knew I wanted to see how it was going to turn out.Without giving anything away the film follows Artemis Fowl who is searching for his lost father. He is aided by an ensemble of a great group of characters that add to the story of the film. The film looks incredible, I was impressed by the visuals when watching in 4K with HDR. The cinematography team nailed it with this one. The story was likable and entertained both me and my eight year old brother.The film was really well made and is fun to watch. Admittedly I may not feel the same way if I was a fan of the book series, but for those who are unfamiliar with it (like myself) I would certainly recommend watching this film. As a filmmaker I have watched a lot of movies, many of which can be dull and hard to watch. However, Artemis Fowl succeeds in entertaining the audience while still being a high quality film.So maybe this isn't the film for you, that is ok. But if you're looking for a fun movie that is perfect for any family or movie lover, give this film a shot.",Artemis Fowl

547,spratelton,Magnificent...ly bad,1,14 June 2020,"An hour and a half I'll never get back! Honestly wanted to switch off so many times, the big names in the cast must be desperate for the Disney dollars because if they cared about their reputations they'd have avoided partaking in this shoddy film. 0 charisma from any of the characters, completely unnecessary narration, awful stationary acting.

556,middleton_jack,One of the worst films I've ever seen,1,12 June 2020,"Truly an awful film. Scraps literally all the charm and myth of the book and misses every mark that would be necessary for even a decent film. The tone is confused, the scene direction is 10/10 for cringe. All those years of Shakespearean study and practice was a waste of time Kennith? Clearly.
Packed with all the muddled and addled virtue signalling nonsense that you could ever need. It not only defuses any sincerity about the characters but also manages to destroy any possible tension. We seem to be in a place in film making where it is taboo and forbidden for anyone to represent negative qualities of any kind. Everyone is good and nice to each other except for characters hidden in cloaks or the colonial British man.Josh Gads narration is not only entirely unnecessary but delivered like a high school students first assessment project.Holly is wrecked. Root is wrecked. Foaley is nothing. Mulch is intolerable. Butler is wrecked. Juliet is nothing.0 tension. 0 nuance. 0 technique.It may be the worst adaption of a book I've ever seen. Definitely at least in the top 5.",Artemis Fowl

561,kwekiwi,Not as bad as they're making it sound,7,24 June 2020,"So, I think Artemis Fowl has things working against it that are giving it some negative reviews that I think are overblown.1. Unreasonable expectations
People who have read the book want it to be Harry Potter or LOTR. It's not. but my kids thoroughly enjoyed it, and that was what I was hoping for.2. Not released to theaters
This would have been more enjoyable in a theater, period. Everyone viewed it from home. Trolls 2 played fairly well from home when it released, this one would have fared better in the big screen.3. Saturation
People have been watching more television from home than ever, and I think many are over-saturated with entertainment and maybe are coming in a little more frumpy than usual.That said, while it may not be up to par with Disney or Kenneth Branaugh's previous efforts, we still found it an enjoyable way to spend an evening, and my kids will probably want to watch it again this week.",Artemis Fowl
562,metodejsvec,"A wasted potential, somebody please make a better version.",4,18 September 2020,"Not even sure where to start.Even if I did not read the books, the movie was just mediocre. The effects were decent for a kids movie, acting was.. acceptable. However the storyline just did not make much sense. In the end, nothing is actually resolved, no defeated villain, no earned character developement no nothing.The whole movie is like a prequel for a series that will most likely never come.I could probably ignore some of the smaller stuff but most of the time, they pretty much took something from the book and completely butchered it. Opal is some form of weird evil fairy, Artemis has absolutely no character similarities with the book and, most important, Butler is just a boring sidekick character. I was hoping for the troll fight at least but no, that would probably be too much to ask.So, in the end, it is watchable, but a great diappointment on almost all levels.

It is not an exact copy of the book for sure, which is exactly what I was hoping for. The story is not nearly as hard to follow as people are making it out to be. My 6 year old cannot stop watching this movie (admittedly might be my excitement rubbing off on him). He loves Mulch Diggums and Holly. Artemis is brimming with his usual cockiness and superiority just like the books. Butler is played exceptionally well and I cried at a certain point (if you actually gave the movie a chance you know what I'm talking about).If this is not turned into a franchise then disney is really losing out on a great story. Hopefully some people will read this and decide to give the movie a proper look and take it for what it is the intro to a grand adventure the likes we haven't seen since Harry Potter or LoTR",Artemis Fowl
568,viszarn,Give it a chance and you'll like it,10,16 June 2020,"Long time fan of the books having read them several times each. This movie while not a faithful scene by scene replay of the movie is exactly what I was looking for in an Artemis Fowl movie. My 6 year old son and I can not stop watching this movie, he is in love with Mulch Diggums and Officer Holly Short. The main man himself Artemis Jr. delivers his signature cockiness and superiority in a way that doesn't make him out to be a coldhearted criminal which in today's times is definitely not a bad thing.Butler is played in spades as the best friend/surrogate father figure to young Artemis when his father is gone. I tear up every time during his ""scene"" (if you actually watch the movie you know the one)Commander root plays her part wonderfully (I will miss the noxious stogeys this character was known for, but again times we live in) as Holly's protective almost motherly figure, while also cutting her no slackCudgeon is immediately dislikable just like the books and is just as slimy as ever.Even Juliet I believe is played amazingly.All in all I cannot believe most of the reviews about this movie. Do people really want a page for page remake of the book? I for o e did not and am extremely happy with how this turned out. Hopefully some people will read this and actually give the movie the chance it deserves. My son and I eagerly await the next installment in this awesome story",Artemis Fowl

So do not expect to see stunning locations. The elves ears just look like they had been stuck on. When the kid said to his father I just want to believe in my dad I knew what a cringe cheesefeast of a movie it was going to be.

I wish someone else acquired the rights, even if they had a smaller budget, not every story is a hero saves the world and the princess Fairy tale -even if it has ""fairies"" in it.

587,jelknet-970-820255,A very fowl movie,1,13 June 2020,"This is an embarrassment on so many fronts, but I'll concentrate on the sloppy storytelling and script writing. As others have said, the narration is mostly needless and the sign of a film in distress. This is no exception. Josh Gad either tells us stuff they forgot to film (or was too expensive to film) or exposition that the movie-makers elected not to bother revealing through dialogue.Speaking dialogue, nearly every line by every character is pure exposition, like a police procedural on TV. There is no character development; hence, there are no characters arcs. Artimus Jr. is a mostly unlikable kid who is so smart has has an answer to everything. He's written so paper-thin he's almost less than one-dimensional. And it doesn't help that the actor portraying him slips in and out of his accent, and delivers his lines very flat.The only thing marginally good about the film is the music, and even that gets repetitive. This may be worse than A Wrinkle in Time, but it's close. It's hard to believe that someone didn't see this train wreck coming prior to going into production.",Artemis Fowl

It didn't follow the story at all. It was a movie based on characters created by Eoin Colfer. However, unless you read the books I don't think you would understand the nature of Artemis Fowl's character. He is supposed to be a child prodigy and a criminal mastermind, but you wouldn't know it by watching the movie except Artemis has to actually state he's a criminal mastermind but never actually participates in any criminal activity or does anything to make you realize he is a mastermind.Butler is supposed to be the bad ass of all bad asses and his first name is supposed to be a secret. This guy just looks like a fat guy in a suit who is confused about what is going on around him.I could go on and on about how they ruined all the characters in this film. If I were Eoin Colfer I would be highly disappointed in how they butchered my story and very upset knowing no other movies would be made after this flop.The articles I read about Eoin's comments on how he approves of some of the changes before the movies was released were probably made as to not offend Disney to preserve future dealings.Not sure when Hollywood is going to figure out people want to see the author's story on the big screen not a director's vision of the same story.With only a few exceptions, the books are always better than the movie.",Artemis Fowl

I haven't read the books but I do want to read them just because the plot sounds good. The movie just made me feel like I missed something. I was confused because Artemis is supposed to be some kind of genius and when he had his ""plan"" I was questioning his genius because it wasn't there. He didn't plan anything that would make me believe this kid was a supposed genius type. Holly literally became friends with Artemis as he had just kidnapped her...uh why? Even Mulch randomly appears in the house and suddenly becomes friends with the whole ""gang."" And when Butler dies...there was just me going ""are you serious?"" Cause Artemis has no emotion for when the butler guy dies and neither does holly and the scene did not make me sad, it just made me go oh...they aren't going to kill a character off, though and lo and behold they didn't because holly got her magic unblocked and was able to save butler.

(Not to mention the fact that Butler would never allow anyone to refer to him as ""Dom"") but that's not why I hated it.The acting was objectively bad. I realise the kids are young, but that's not an excuse. It was as though it was their first time reading the script.The characters made decisions that no real person would ever make. Holly Short goes from captive to friend in a matter of seconds.No explanation as to the boundaries/capabilities of magic. No explanation as to how the time stop works or why it's supposed to be such a big deal when it breaks.We were supposed to be invested when a character looks like they're on the brink of death, but we've been given no reason to care and no reason to think they're actually going to die.The book gave plenty of explanations as well as more realistic motivations for all of the actions taken.This film has inspired me to go back and reread the series, as a way of purging the memory of this insult to the books.This is the worst film I can remember seeing.I went into this film wanting to love it, especially since I, like many fans, have been waiting nearly 20 years for it. The first 15 minutes was awful. And it only got worse.The people at Disney need to learn how to tell a story, and maybe take a writer/director who cares about the source material.So many iconic moments were missing.

Kenneth Branagh has no idea what he's doing and his justifications for some of the choices he took made me question his sanity.
The dialogue is cringy, and incredibly disjointed. It's as if all the actors were in seperate rooms while delivering their lines and they just edited it all together.
Casting of actors: horrible.
Special effects: horrible
Story line: horrible
Editing: horrible
Directing: horrible.
Experience: The worst",Artemis Fowl
618,darkliberator,Did you even read the books?,1,6 November 2020,"So the Director claims that you would not be able to relate to the Artemis Fowl character in the books in a move.
Kenneth Branagh, you are wrong! WE CAN RELATE TO POKEMON TRAINERS AT THE AGEOF 10 WITH SUPER WEAPON PETS!
WHY WOULD WE NOT RELATE TO HIM!
Artemis Fowl is supposed to be a super genius, hate outside, only wants money because his FATHER! has disappeared and his mother went into a catatonic state.
Just the first 6 minutes! Introduce MULCH (a most amusing thief) wrong! HE IS A DWARF AND SUPPOSED TO BE SHORT!
BUT! Artemis never loved Ireland either, it's just that his mansion is there and the loves his heritage as thief's and masterminds of the underworld.How can you fail one of my favorite book series of all time? By doing what Kenneth Branagh did, and claim we can't relate to a 11 year old. Duck him and all he stands for, in regards to this movie.PS: Artemis was so smart that he never went to school he only (because he had to fake he is listening to the law) went to speak to a psychologist! ...So no, already I have screamed myself dry of ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOO"" at a screen that can't hear me.

628,IanCoc,"Awful adaptation, terrible movie",1,14 June 2020,"There is a real problem in reviewing a book to movie adaptation if you are familiar with the source material. I have read the original book, and the rest of the series, and they are all witty and tightly plotted.Eoin Colfer's own description of the book was ""Die Hard with Fairies"" and that does nicely explain the fun feel of the novel
The film is none of these things.
It is obviously very difficult to adapt a book for a film, the issues of length alone can be insurmountable, however, that isn't really an excuse for mashing (I think) three of the original books together, then completely changing the character of the protagonist (books - think Lex Luthor in a world without Superman. Film, goodness knows what!) The character of Artemis' father doesn't appear in the first book, presumably they got Colin Farrell so decided to shoehorn him in for no good reason. The fact he had absolutely nothing to do can be glossed over, right?
So, really difficult to review the film without bemoaning the evisceration of the source material. However, there are specific weaknesses. Artemis himself, I'm sure Robert Shaw's relative is a fine actor, but given what he had to work with he was awful here. Holly should have been cast with an adult and digitally made smaller. All due respect the actor isn't mature enough to catch the nuances. Foaly, the centaur, also has nothing to do, and the centaur CGI was done better in Hercules the Legendary Journeys twenty odd years ago. If you feel your film needs an interminable narration throughout you've probably messed up the script.
Dame Judi Dench, as always, was good.
If you liked the books - Avoid. Same goes for if you don't know the source material. Luckily it's streamed so it shouldn't waste too much of your money if you catch it by accident.",Artemis Fowl

Endearing quirks. The two most blatant is Butler and Mulch Diggums. Butler was to be a solid serveant protector who defined the name Butler. Mulch Diggums was just the wrong size and never cleanly setup why he was the wrong size. I can forgive changing the gender of commander root, but still. This whole script was bad.A few special effects are good, but it's hard to watch because it doesn't match the treasured story.The story is rewritten and re-written poorly.

657,longste,Not as bad as people say but a wasted opportunity,6,13 June 2020,"The basic story is there, the kidnap of Holly, the seige of fowl Manor but the reasons for it are changed from villain artemis just wanting gold to a need to save his father. Artemis is played fairly well, but his personality is so different, he is no villain and will not get the chance to grow to be a hero like in the books due to Disney being gutless and not making him the villain of film 1 like he was in book 1. Butler is under used and isn't called butler but just to annoy the fans is called by his first name domovoi. Juliet is not his niece not sister, why? Root is played well if you can ignore the gender swap. Holly is played well as is mulch but they are both to tall, like all the elves in the LEP in fact, almost like Disney didn't want to spend money on effects to make them the right 1 meter height. Foaly is under used so much due to the run time. The action is solid as are the special effects. The run time is way to short. So much was cut even from the trailers, obviously Disney decided to ignore all the adult fans who have loved the books for 20 years and aim it at young kids, so we have a short run time with lots of action but little character development. It's a shame because when the film makers respect the source we get both adults and kids enjoying it like with Harry Potter. With this film it will be enjoyed by kids but hated my many, many fans of the books. If a sequel is made they will need to learn from their mistakes and get a better director than KB who needs to stick to classics and Shakespeare. Haven City looks the part but again is under used.

660,morganbarton,Josh Gad was the only good thing about this movie,2,15 June 2020,"While I have never read the books, I went in with high hopes for this movie. With leads Josh Gad, Dame Judi Dench, and Colin Farrell, a huge fan following for the books, and what seemed to be a really cool new universe to discover, I was pretty excited we were going to get to see it on Disney Plus for free!All of this being said, the production value, effects, cast, and music are the only reason this gets an extra star. You can tell this could have been an amazing story, but the lack of exposition, storyline, and character development are too glaring to be overlooked.As someone who cried at the drop of a hat and can develop empathy for almost any character with even a small bit of good character development, I was shocked by my own reaction when a character that I should have cared about literally died and I felt nothing. I didn't tear up, didn't have an ounce of emotion for him. What should have been an impactful moment and an amazing celebration right after, meant nothing.Major holes and issues:
Development between Artemis and Dom. They seemingly have a Bruce Wayne/Alfred relationship, but we wouldn't know for sure because they're not developed at all.Artemis is very well trained, he and Dom take on an entire fairy squad in their own. How? How and when was he trained? We just assume he's trained because Dom is trained? This literally could have been solved by a two minute montage in the morning of Dom waking up Artemis and saying, ""Let's go, time for daily training."" And training being interrupted by the phone call from the bad guy.Artemis says ""We need the suit"". The suit has never been previously revealed and we don't know what it does. Is the suit magic? Does the suit have magical powers? What?The fairy world's feelings towards Holly. We have one guy in the whole movie who expresses animosity towards Holly, yet when she gets an assignment and praise at the end, you can tell that's impactful for her.... but it isn't for us. Again, could've had a moment where she goes for a salute and no one salutes back, or a group of fairies calls her a traitor in the street scene.Why does Artemis asking Holly ""Can I trust you?"" And Holly responding with what she said warrant him removing his glasses and blindly trusting her? You could've had her have a breakdown and cry over her father and saying how she wants to prove his innocence and him feeling and understanding that and then sharing his story too. Leaving his glasses on until after they share a moment when Holly saves Dom, which also could have happened and been another impactful moment. EMOTION. MOTIVATION. DEVELOPMENT.Juliet. Zero purpose. Served absolutely no purpose. Why was she there? To do the butler duties Dom is supposed to do? Because all she did was bring people food. And the fairies just let her hang out at the tower during the whole battle. Convenient.Why did they say Dom hated being called a butler, but there's never a pay off for that? Diggum knew that, great opportunity for a comedic moment. We got nothin.There were so many other issues, too many to name, but they dropped the ball on this movie. I get this was a movie aimed at kids, but as so many adults read this book and fell in love too, this was really a disservice to them. Feel bad for the fans of the book...",Artemis Fowl
661,jannob-42855,The WORST movie I have ever seen!!!!!!!,1,12 June 2020,"The reason why I say this is because:
1. The main antagonist: There is no background to the charactar which explains the reason why she wants to teleport her army. The only thing they tell you is that"" she is one of the smartest fairies who turned evil"". And thats all! ( I just wished they developed her charactar more throughout the movie)
2. The main protagonist: Ferdia Shaw who plays Artemis Fowl jr lacks emotion among other things. For eg. When Butler died I cringed so hard that scene because the actor needed to cry that scene but he just ended up looking constipated. I could help but laugh and cringe at the same time. Conclusion: Ferdie in my opinion was the biggest problem in this movie because he is the main charactar but doesn't know how to act PERIOD
3. Overall charactar development: This was also a big problem which also annoyed me! For eg. Juliet butler ( I dont even know why she was in the movie she had almost no dialogs), Turf Graafmans, Holly Short .... the list cloud go on and on honestly!
4. THE CGI! They had a 125 Million Dollar buget and the film still ended up looking like PLAY DOH. Okey maybe I'm over exaggerating but I mean come on! They missed a great opportunity to make a GREAT movie. Because the original storyline (in the books) is AWESOME! They just had to add theyr own flair which ultimately ruined the movie!
Conclusion: Its a great movie to watch IF YOUR BELOW THE AGE OF 9!!! I wanna see movie refilmed with better actors! I would not recommend this movie to anyone because you may end up cringing so hard that you'll have to use the toilet!! I AM NOT KIDDING IT HAPPENED TO ME :-(",Artemis Fowl

Dame Judi Dench looks like she's smelled a fart all movie long and hates to be there.
The main actors Ferdia Shaw and Lara McDonnell have the combined charisma of a smelly wet rag, perfomances are so wooden they wouldn't even suffice for a Pinocchio remake, and the onscreen chemistry reminds of an old forgotten stale empty bottle of amyl: good intentions, but ultimately non-effective and solely headache inducing.
Is Colin Farrell trying to corner the market on mumbling tragic dad roles?! Artemis, Dumbo, Saving Mr Banks ... all played as a single note carbon copy of eachother.

The characters are completely subverted, there is not one character who talks or behave or even looks like it does in the book. The focal points in the relationships between the various characters have been completely turned inside out and they seem more like foolish caricatures of themselves. The story is a totally different one, plots and characters from 4 different books all mixed up together without logic.
I have seen many great books turned into bad movies, but this is without doubt the worst. There is not one thing I can salvage in this massacre. Not one.
It's not even a good movie for people who didn't read the books, it's rushed, flat, boring and confusing. Truly, truly a disappointment. I waited for an Artemis Fowl movie for years, I grew up with the books but I would rather they didn't made an adaptation if this was going to be the result.",Artemis Fowl

676,jazziefrost,Shambolic and ill-conceived from beginning to end.,1,13 June 2020,"Whilst I'm a huge fan of the books, I understand that Hollywood can't always convert literature to the Silver Screen. This......atrocity is no Artemis Fowl movie, and is painful to view for a multitude of reasons.Characters are introduced with barely any screen time and the flimsiest of narratives, most are pointless loose ends that only serve as jumping points for a sequel, and things like character development or relationship-building has been tossed to the wayside - but with nothing in its place. Core characters have been shattered and mutilated beyond recognition, and it spoils the essence of Artemis Fowl Jr. in the most casual manner.A key facet of Artemis is his arrogance, his ego. He is a driving force, master manipulator, socially inept, physically useless. Whatever wimpy, sporting, foot-stamper I just exposed my eyeballs to was *nothing* like that, and that's a major catastrophe for not just this movie but the entire franchise. Book-wise, Artemis learns about fairy folk independently. He is obsessed with finding his father and funding further research into discovering them. He is an uncaring, unsympathetic character who steals a copy of the Fairy holy book in order to exploit the Fairy people, beat them at their own game, and steal a metric tonne of gold for the purpose of reinflating his wallet. His father was a cold, hardened, high-profile criminal who never gave Artemis as much as a supporting pat on the back - and all of these character aspects are what made the book phenomenal. The entire series deals with character development within adolescence and early adulthood, but also the notion that regardless of how much brain power you have, Butler will not always be around to save him, and this you need a support network.Which brings me to another point - potentially trivial but bothers me massively nonetheless. Butlers name is Domovoi. Artemis does not know this. In Book3 (The Eternity Code) his name is only revealed when literally dying in Artemis' arms. This was a huge and emotional moment, that makes NO sense now thanks to it being revealed right off the bat. For a movie that was practically screaming ""SEQUEL SEE THERE WILLBE A SEQUEL ITS NOT OVER SEQUEL SEQUEL"", they sure did trash a whole load of plotline and development that could have been sequel material.Aside from the glaring plot disparities, unenthusiastic performances, total lack of on screen chemistry or emotion, and dreadful CGI (lookin' at you, Mulch) - the whole movie makes limited sense, the aesthetics are basic and repetitive, the score is simply filler and is as bland as plasticine, and humour is lacking even I'm funny moments.It's a good job I never have to subject myself to the tripe and drivel that spewed forth from my television, and I'm confident in saying that there wont be another one to follow.

It's 90 mins of fast paced action.

The kids liked it but were confused by plot jumps and the ""magic solves all"" constant thread without anyone earning the solution. It keeps stating he's a criminal mastermind but he doesn't partake in any crime nor has he even demonstrated why crime is his choice of career. The kids couldn't understand that part. Anyway.

The writers turned Artemis into a sob story of a character instead of the emotional hard, Sherlock Holmes level genius, he is in the very first book. Completely straying from the story has caused the whole movie to be not even a tolerable B movie. This series could have easily rivaled the Harry Potter franchise, but with this horrendously botched effort it looks like this will run it into the ground. The removal of his mother, one of his main concerns, is disheartening and the instant retrieval of his father appallingly boring! Adding to this the introduction of many characters that are never mentioned in the first book obliterating all mystery and forging the strong, highly trained Butler to a whimpering side show.

You were also kinda just thrown into the movie. I had no idea what was going on (except for his dad being captured by an anonymous figure). I don't understand how/if this figure is connected to the fairies, or why the fairies were fighting Artemis at all. The story just didn't make a whole bunch of sense and seemed way too short.The movie felt unfinished, but I think the second installment will have much more of a story arc from this first movie.

689,mgeiran-64428,Shocking,1,13 June 2020,"I read the books as a kid and was really excited when I heard this movie was finally coming out. I never compare movies to their books because you can't fit everything in, and some things will always be changed, that never bothers me.This movie is terrible though, I got halfway in and had to see how long was left to decide if I wanted to commit to finishing it.
It feels rushed, with very little explanation or backstory, giving the impression that it was made for people who read the books and know the characters. The problem with this is they've changed so much that it's not an accurate reflection of the characters at all.
There's no real explanation given as to the supposed threats or danger that they're working to stop, so you don't feel overly invested in seeing them succeed.
The acting is quite bad in my personal opinion, I only enjoyed the performance of maybe two characters, with the rest being fairly lackluster. This includes the main character of Artemis, the actor is young so I'm sure he'll improve in the future but this performance felt like he was constantly just relaying lines he had memorised with nothing else behind it.I hope they don't go any further with this and make a sequel.

Just including small snippets and micro-nuggets from the original dialogue interspersed within a re-written timeline and depreciative rearrangement of the storyline does not a good movie adaptation make.

The main issue comes from its pace : the movie is going so fast between scenes and situation that it lefts absolutely no room for exposition, character development or consistent story. As a movie, it is barely enjoyable.On the adaptation side, I do not think they could fail more to get what Artemis Fowl is all about. The book is based on the very simple fact that Artemis is, actually, the bad guy. He extorts and kidnaps fairies, showing no emotion except when it comes to his mom. the version of Artemis we get in this movie is so badly written it's so hard to watch.I can give credit to few scenes such as Holly leaving Haven City and fighting the Troll. But that's 3 minutes of it. Foaly is useless and lacks the humour He is supposed to have. Mulch Diggums however has some nice moments, but damn the visual effects are not on point.As always the story is the key of a movie, and here, it's pure garbage : the fact that they needed a character to do the narrator during the whole movie is an admission of their failure.Kenneth Branagh shows that book adaption is not his strongest point.Disney, please, stop books adaptations, thank you.",Artemis Fowl

He's got the wit to find a way out. But in this movie, he comes off more like a whiney and pretentious brat. The only recognizable part of this character is the iconic suit and sunglasses.Holly Short didn't feel like her spunky self, and only came across as ditzy and mediocre at best. She wasn't this strong character that she was in the books, and it truely felt like a crime to her character.They genderswapped commander Root, one of my favorite characters. I love Judy Dench as an actress, but she added nothing to the character and felt like a cheap virtue-signalling substitute. She felt very 2D and shallow as a character, which made me very upset. But that doesn't even get to what made me the most angry, oh no.They F'd up Buttler. My hands down favorite character was broken down into the butt of the jokes. They reffused to pay homage to the book and insisted that ""Anyone who reffered to him as Buttler would surely regret it"" and proceeded to call him Dom the entire movie. Normally, that wouldn't be too bad. But they also made him into the emotional character of the movie, which isn't nessicarily bad if his character wasn't supposed to be someone who we know and loved because he had the emotions of a rock. The man's emotions in the books were so complex and had to be earned to witness. But in this trainwreck of a movie, they even gave him the painstaking ""I'm not gunna cry"" line.-They made Opal more comparable to the lovechild of Skeletor and Dr. Evil.She was evil for evil's sake and no more. They even gave her the generic ""I'm going to take over the world"" schpeel.But there is one thing I can say that's good about the movie. The special effects were neat. But that's it. Everything else made me want to carve my soul out with a dull fork. Please don't watch this movie, go pick up the book",Artemis Fowl
723,alannadunleavy,So disappointed,1,13 June 2020,"This movie had such promise but you removed everything that made the story great. The acting is cringy and the plot is paper weak. You had such a great story to go off of, why would you choose to make this instead???

Please do NOT sequel this. Please just do better.",Artemis Fowl
724,warrennic,Childhood=ruined,1,13 June 2020,"Not only does this movie completely disregard the entire book series, but it goes out of its way to change the whole story line.

726,kmorrison-37567,Hard to watch.,2,13 June 2020,Judi Dench's character sounds like she ate cigarettes for breakfast. No depth to her cheesy costumes. The movie was hard to sit through. I will never get that hour back of my life. I would have rather watched paint dry.,Artemis Fowl
727,osmas-97675,Absolute Rubbish!,2,13 June 2020,"Watched this last night and it made me thankful that the current pandemic forced it straight to VOD as if had paid for a ticket to watch thos at the cinema, I would be asking for my money back.Calling this Artemis Fowl is an insult to Eoin Colfer.
To say this is based on the book is a joke, it simply borrows the character names and a couple of features and then barbarically cobbles together a sham of a story.The acting was okay, but amazing, but if it had been a decent story I could have dealt with it, but what I cannot deal with:Changing Root to female. Why? Did the director feel they didn't have enough strong female characters? What about Holly, second in importance only to Artemis himself in the first book. And Juliet Butler, she develops into a very strong character. As good as Judi Dench is, she did not need to be in this film, certainly not as Julius Root.Butler. ""Whatever you do, dont call him the Butler"". When I saw that Nonso Anozie was cast, I was excited to see a good representation for the complex character, bit this was not the case at all. The film has you believe that the bodyguard to Artemis Fowl jr, who is barely seen considering he is essentially attached to Artemis in the books, does not get called Butler, bit instead by his first name. The literal opposite of how it actually was in the books. There was no need at all to change this in the film, it served no importance to the plot.The Aculos. Another item not needed. Why it couldn't follow the plot of the book is beyond me, it was exciting enough that it generated an entire series of books after it.All in all, if it wasnt for a few sections of the film that made me laugh in a good way, I would have given this one star, but the filmmakers should thank Josh Gad as Mulch Diggums for the second.I would not recommend watching this film. Definitely not if you have read and enjoyed the books, but also not even if you haven't because it is not that enjoyable as a standalone.",Artemis Fowl
728,allinonecom,Worst movie ever from Disney..,1,13 June 2020,How does a company like Disney make such a big mistake? This movie abandoned everything that we knew and loved about the story. The direction was awful and the story was a jumble of so many books that it felt like they wanted to make the the movie just because they had nothing to make. The movie was a letdown from what we saw in the trailer.,Artemis Fowl
729,aimeesc-43005,Disappointed,1,13 June 2020,I was excited to hear that one of my favourite book series was being made into a movie and to watch it. Instead I found a mismatch of story lines from multiple books and the only thing in common with the original series being the characters names. Even the things that made it unique (i.e. Artemis Fowl's whole base character) were altered for the movie and instead he is introduced as a typical surfing loving teenager who loves to hang out with his dad. Ultimately it comes across as a failed attempted at making a new franchise that the original book series lovers would find it hard to get their teeth into,Artemis Fowl

And after sitting through this I still don't know anything about the character. Alas despite lengthy periods of exposition (poor Josh Gad having to deliver reams of the stuff in close up straight into camera) it wasn't clear why anybody was behaving the way they were, because the script felt like it was written as a box ticking exercise by a committee. What a shame. I really liked the design (although why the fairy troops were wearing Adidas cricket helmets back to front was a mystery) and some of the sequences were directed with flair. The performances were universally OK; young Ferdia Shaw was no worse than anyone else, but with no plot or character development nobody stood much of a chance. It was all too frenetic. I fear young Mr Fowl will be joining Alex Rider as a young adult film series that never was.",Artemis Fowl

The production quality was great, but the acting was a bit questionable, and the storyline seemed almost nonexistent. I felt like I was watching a long summary of a 24 episode Artemis Fowl tv series (which I would have much preferred and would have done the books justice). The plot progression jumped around a lot leaving me feeling as if I missed key plot turns and character development, almost as if I had fallen asleep for a short time (I did not). But that aside, the movie had the opportunity to be great with it's assumed high production value, well known actors, and quality source material.

This movie does absolutely no justice and just disrespects Eoin Colfers writing. I understand Disney wanted to appeal to the current generation of children but this is not the way to do it.

Disney couldn't have gone further wrong with producing a film that has only really only taken the names from the source material.
Judy Dench was completely irrelevant, Artemis was weakly played.
None of the relationships were explored as they were in the books, no character development.
Disney also seems to be obsessed with josh gad, who along with the sex change of julius riot destroyed what little the film had going for it.

For an example in the book Artemis knew his father was a criminal mastermind but in the movie he was surprised to find this out, also Artemis
was pale and calculating but now he is a athlete and is not as intelligent as before. I am about to use some profundity so I apologize but I consider this movie S*** and I would like something better considering we have been waiting for a movie for 4 years.

I can stand combing the movies I get it but atleast get the character correct. Thats what pisses me off the most.

This is the WORST book adaptation I have ever seen. In the first ten minutes, Artemis surfs, rides a hoverboard, and wears JEANS. None of which the character in the book would actually do. He also calls Butler by his first name and Juliet is 12 years old. And the Fowl Star yacht is the Owl Star. Really? The plot bears only a passing resemblance to the book with a few plot points that are lifted from the pages of the series but are twisted into something different. The book has an amazing plot - why would you change that?
And even if you hadn't read the books, this movie is terrible. Poor writing, weird plot points (seriously Artemis just asks Holly if he can trust her and then takes off his glasses?) and much of it doesn't make sense. The acting isn't awful but the actors are shoehorned into awful dialogue.

The only shining moment is the casting, with the exception of Juliet WHO IS 21, NOT 12. I was absolutely aghast at how truly awful this was. They couldn't even stick to one plot line from one book. They made creative decisions that takes away the probability of a whole book being made into a movie (I'm looking at you Time Paradox), and the removal of two entire characters (while minor, still important characters).

If it weren't for the title of the film and it's characters it would be unrecognizable.The story of the first book alone would have sufficed to fill 90 minutes, establish the most notable characters and make for an amazing first Artemis Fowl movie of a hypothetical series.It is rather safe to say that after this movie the chances of a squeal or any proper recovery are as likely as it would be for Opal Koboi to joyfully ride on Foleys' back... aka none.",Artemis Fowl
782,fitzgerald-51125,Huge disappointment.,1,1 July 2020,"Did the people who made this abomination even read the books? They have removed all of the whimsy, humor, and general genius of the books and made the characters unrecognizable. Artemis athletic? Calling Butler by his first name? Foley isn't even sarcastic. Ridiculous.
This is a bad movie even if you have not read the books. No flow. No characters worthy of note. Horrible script. What a shame! This could have been an amazing series of movies to rival Harry Potter.",Artemis Fowl
783,tcmneeb,Worst case,1,3 July 2020,"I am impressed. This film reminded me in quality, acting and cliche SO much to the film version of Tolkiens Lord of the Rings - that is, the one by Ralph Bakshi 1978, which completely ignored the books details and pissed of the fans (me included).
No one at Disney seems having read at least one of the series books completely, and so just decided to make a little-kids-movie with a few nice animations.Actors: Some main figures besides Artemis suddenly turned teens, like Holly and Butlers daughter, Judy Dench (what a waste for such an actress) suddenly turns the fat cigar-smoking Commander Root into an old woman with messy hair, Butler turned from Asian now very P.C. in black with ridiculously artificial blue eyes, crying streaks of tears down his cheeks for his own demise while Artemis calles him BUTLER;
Artemis, the GENIUS criminal mind is exactly the genius criminal mind for the first 10 minutes (in school) and the last 5 (""I have to make a call first, to tell Opal that Artemis Fowl is coming"" or so...), between this he gets lost in the plot.
Fowley as a ridiculous jumping centaur with stylish half-cut hairstyle and so on...Plot: The cliches are so forseeable when Artemis drops his milk at the news, the heroes in the end fly into sunset and for a moment I was afraid A and Holly would kiss, but it was only a soo touchy BFF *sob* with a hand shake. ""Can I trust you?"" ""Yes."" Ah, alright, nice to know. Great. But first a slap in the face. So much for the cliche-collection.
The whole ""time-stop business"" is confusingly working-broken-working again-exploding and the end pasted from book two makes the plot even more senseless.I enjoyed all books of the series reading them to my kids years ago and thus saw now another good material for a film being sacrificed on the altar of money.
Well, if we are lucky, there will be another Peter Jackson coming along in 30 years turning this material into a successful film...",Artemis Fowl

I grew up small and intelligent, I truly identified with him. I didn't care about anyone in this entire film. I wasn't emotionally invested at any point.

Although, it is 90 minutes of my life that I would like to have back and ask for a refund on.There are rare and fleeting sections from the book that make appearances. One good thing... I do like the idea of telling the story from Mulch Diggums point of view... the books took the position of writing from a doctor trying to understand the character and motives of Artemis Fowl, but other than that...The script was like trying to watch a 3 hour movie at double speed. There is so much that just disappointed... The fact that Angeline Fowl (His mother) is dead makes the potential for future movies impossible.

Poorly made, the story line is non existent and non of the cast/characters remotely resemble the ones in the books.
Nothing of the spirit of the books has made it into the film.
They even managed to get the sex of root wrong just so they could squeeze Judy Dench into the film, presumably to try and catch the eyes of viewers and encourage them to watch it.I'm astonished that Eion Colfer allowed this butchered steaming pile to be made and labeled as ""based"" on his books.The entire thing has been twisted and contorted into something that is an insult to both the author and fans of the books!Poor show Disney, poor show.....",Artemis Fowl

It is Incredibly sad that while Disney owns virtually everything it can still get away by pumping out crap movies that have a nostalgia factor to them. :(",Artemis Fowl
794,lanangeroni,If you read and TRULY loved the books...,1,12 August 2020,"YOU WILL HATE THIS MOVIE.I am absolutely disgusted at how they butchered the books. Beyond fuming. They murdered my childhood in the name of Disney!Let me try to list some of the ways in which they committed this atrocity against the books (contains spoilers, and in no particular order):Artemis Fowl would never go surfing! He was not an athletic child. He would not be surfing, or hoverboarding or whatever that thing was. He rarely participated in physical activity, letting Butler do the heavy lifting, while he used mere intelligence. He would be absolutely USELESS in physical combat.In the books, Arty's father was a master criminal, but not a particularly great one. And he had NOTHING to do with the fairies. Artemis believed in the fairies. He tracked down a sprite in the human world, and gained access to the secret book. He created a computer program which cracked the fairy code. He was trying to uphold and restore the criminal name of Fowl by pulling off the biggest heist of all time: stealing fairy gold. His father doesn't come into actual play until book two, and he has nothing to do with the fairy world. He was kidnapped by plain old humans.
They rewrote Gnomish. Yes, I can still read the fairy code. And they changed the characters for the letters.
Angeline Fowl is NOT dead in the books. She is in severe emotional distress, and out of her head over the loss of her husband. She is delusional, drifting in and out of the past and present, barely recognizing her son. Artemis carefully keeps her condition hidden, so he can continue with his criminal dealings unchecked. She plays a very large role in Artemis's character development.Juliet Butler is Domovoi's sister, not niece, and she's 16. She wants to be a professional wrestler.A Butler NEVER reveals his or her first name to his charge/employer. A Butler's first name is only revealed when they are dying or dead.Commander Julius Root was male in the books. Constantly angry, turned purple in the face when angry (earning the nickname Beetroot), and was infamous for smoking noxious fungus cigars. Holly Short was the ONLY FEMALE IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE LEP! By making Root female and adding other female officers to the force, they completely invalidated Holly as a character, and her mentor/mentee relationship with Commander Root. So much of Holly's motivation comes from her desire to prove herself as the first ever female LEP officer. Holly's father was not a traitor. Root rides Holly much harder than the other officers because he is trying to help her prove herself, and keep her ever precarious position on the force. He endorses her repeatedly, as the first and only female officer. He is like a father figure to her.WHAT THE HELL IS AN ACULOS?!? Did not exist in the books. And Opal Koboi doesn't come into play until book 4.Mulch Diggums is supposed to only BARELY pass as human. They made dwarves way too human. He also enters the house through the wine cellar. They completely cut, changed, or vagued up other dwarf abilities. Beard hair that can be shaped, and then holds shape when plucked, perfect for picking locks. It also acts as antennae, picking up vibration underground, a kind of dwarf sonar. Dwarf spit, which hardens and glows in the dark. Dwarves are also EXTREMELY sun sensitive. Dwarves are able to absorb moisture through their pores, and can essentially spider man over/up any surface due to this ability. Mulch escapes by faking his own death, slipping the contact into the eye of a rabbit, killing it and faking a cave in.Cudgeon joins with Opal AFTER he is humiliated during the failed rescue attempt of Holly Short. Artemis succeeds, by successfully kidnapping a fairy, and negotiating for Holly's return. He receives fairy gold as ransom, and successfully escapes the bio bomb, out witting the fairies at almost every turn.Holly was supposed to be at Tara performing the ritual to refresh her magic, by burying an acorn under the light of the full moon. She was captured because she was unable to use magic. As the books put it, she was not, ""running hot.""Butler takes on the troll alone, and almost dies for it. Holly ACCIDENTLY heals him, and he then takes down the troll, after Holly fights it. Holly swoops in and saves him, after escaping by tricking Juliet and using the mesmer effect on her.Artemis and crew escape the time freeze and bio bomb by doing the impossible: falling asleep. The fairies planned to kill them all and take the gold back once Holly was recovered. Humans, fairies, living creatures cannot fall asleep when in a time freeze. Not if they were awake when it is implemented. Artemis and his associates escape the time freeze and bio bomb (which decimates ALL living things) by taking sleeping pills. He used his mother Angeline, to test the theory when the time freeze was first activated.These are just a few main points. If you loved the books, don't waste your time on this movie. If you've never read the books, have fun. Just know, this movie has little to nothing to do with the wonderful series written by Eoin Colfer",Artemis Fowl

If you are over 12 years old you probably will not like this. It seems they took a lot of ideas from other movies and put it in here there was several times where I was saying to myself I seen this before it's just like this movie it's just like that movie nothing original.

Characters are completely altered to unrecognizable, especially Butler whose first name is revealed and commonly used. Mulch Diggums is changed into a ""giant dwarf."" The father is not only present in the movie but plays an active role. The mother is dead. Opal Koboi is the mastermind. Foaly isn't the conspiracy theory nut.

I loved the books growing up, they where incredibly well written with enough adult themes to make them enjoyable at any age.

I'm not comparing this movie to Fight Club, Saving Private Ryan, or Schindler's List. This movie delivers. Great visuals, good character development, and it's fun to watch.Many reviews stop at the 10 minute mark. Honestly? I thought about stopping myself. The lead actor is vain and unlikable. Hot take: that's the point. Artemis Fowl isn't the character you want to be. He's wildly arrogant, and respects nobody but Albert Einstein. However, this is what makes it meaningful when he sees the other characters in the movie as his peers and equals.Many people remark on how they read the book or whatever and were lost. I know we are all sitting at home, but get off your phone. I read the books so long ago I thought this was going to be another YA series ""The Thief Lord"". If I can figure out what's going on after thinking it was a movie about thieves in Venice, you can figure it out.This is not the usual Disney movie, and it shows. It has the occasional 'why would you do that' moment, but remember... this movie is PG.

I'd have appreciated an additional 30 minutes if the story were actually developed. It shows like trying to cram 4 novels into a 90 minute show...which may be what they did.The narration is dumb. Judy Dench did an ""OK"" job (it's hard for her not to act well). Dialog was completely predictable...if you could follow the plot...such as it wasn't.Spoilers. Did I say the CGI was really cool? All the interactions between the humans and fairies seem to be based on some set of undefined/unexplained rules between the species. Oh, by the way, was the point of everything all part of what Artemis planned in order to get to the artifact? Not evident. And then he was surprised it was there? Ok, damage the time thingy and then you have 7 minutes until failure. The fairies break their rules by sending in a troll and then just stand around outside doing squat all. Some of the poorest military strategists in the universe.

Good adaptation: Kept very close to the book, including it's flaws. The John Adams series.Bad: It's bad as a film and as an adaptation. Unfortunately, the much-anticipated Artemis Fowl movie, based on one of my favorite series of all times, joins other such infamous adaptations as Eragon and the Percy Jackson Movies.They completely changed the story and the characters, undercutting almost all the emotional and physical triumphs of the book series. They invalidated the characters. And, they tried to shoehorn in emotional moments, but cut out all the development so we went from point A1 to point Banana without any idea how we got there.I would give it one star, but the graphics were decent.I had thought there was so much potential for this movie, but none of it was realized.

I would rate it 3.5-4 stars. Definitely something family can watch together for relaxing evening without violence, innuendoes or bad language. The movie is 135 min long which is just right. The fact that the story is narrated by Munch is weird and somewhat distracting but explained at very end. The story is easy to follow and simplified from the books (i found the books somewhat weird and it took my a while to figure out the book world).The acting is fine, even though the creators missed some opportunities to make the characters, especially AF and Butler more memorable. The special effects are well done and the fairy world as well as AF mansion have high production values. We actually quite liked the characters of Holly Short and Munch, even though Munch's portrayal is too close to HP Haggrid.My kids who have AF memorized immediately commented that the story is different from the book but that didn't stopped them from enjoying the movie. We had several good laughs, there was some good suspense and action for them (the troll scene, the final battle) and after the movie was over we had goo discussion what was different from the books and what worked well and not so well. We are hoping there will be a sequel as there is not enough characters and stories like this for kids.Finally, if you have Disney+ you get this movie at no additional cost and its production value, story telling and world portrayal is much better and original than most other traditional Disney movies. Give it a chance and watch it with open mind and you may just find you will enjoy it.",Artemis Fowl

I had never read the books, to be fair so I'm coming into this with no prior knowledge. Let me start by saying the narration was a major annoyance for me. Josh Gad was a total miscast for this. The story hardly made any sense, the characters were lifeless and and impossible to relate with.I was thinking so, this kids hyper intelligent, had literally no friends and then trusts a fairy within 2 minutes after not even believing they exist. There was no background, the antagonist is all but a mystery when it's pretty crucial to the story of his father.I was hugely disappointed but overall, I truly believe Josh Gad was a major miscast.",Artemis Fowl

This vague attempt at creating a Harry Potter style franchise for Disney has backfired majorly!

840,Chibiani,Movie treats audience like idiots,1,13 June 2020,"When I saw the sloppily edited trailer for this movie, I knew it would not merit my ticket revenue at a theater. Since its early arrival on Disney + due to the pandemic, I thought I may give this movie a chance. Having not read the books, I had no expectations.
A good portion of this movie is narrated by Mulch Diggins played by Josh Gad. I don't mind a little bit of narration in a movie right before an opening title, but the narration in this movie went on for about 20 minutes, even going as far to explain events that were unfolding in front of us. The movie doesn't trust it's audience to understand what is going on.
The actor playing Artemis Fowl gave some of the flattest delivery of dialogue I have ever seen. The studio could have gotten a more charismatic performance out of a plank of wood with a happy face drawn on it.
Judi Dench played her role with what seemed like great reluctance, convincing me that Disney has black mail on her.
The movie drags on for the introduction of the main character and rushes through the plot, making it feel rushed and snail-like in its pacing at the same time.
Halfway through the movie, Artemis kidnaps a fairy to lure the rest of them to his house to find the McGuffin. Only hours later, he releases her and she gives him her unconditional friendship and help in his mission, despite being tranquilized and kidnapped by said friend earlier that same day. Trusting your captor and giving him what he wants is a pretty dangerous lesson to teach anyone, let alone a young impressionable audience that is clearly the target demographic of this movie.
Scarcely any time is spent establishing Artemis and Dovokoi as anything other than an employee/employer relationship making the tension at his near-death implausible, which ended up not mattering since Agent Short (the fairy) just brought him back to life.
The movie is sloppily edited and poorly acted that I can't spend any more energy describing it. Save yourself 2 hours and skip it.",Artemis Fowl

844,paulismyhero,Lost and confused,2,18 June 2020,"The departures from its source material are the least of this movie's problems. Artemis Fowl begins rushed and never finds it's pacing or tone. This film also relies heavily on narration, almost all of which is unnecessary and only describes what is happening on screen or tells the audience what is about to happen. about 90 of the narration and dialog is exposition which ruins both the characters and the plot. in fact any time a situation or object is introduced the next line of dialog immediately explains it and the people involved in the most patronizing and repetitive way. It was so repetitive and filled with useless phrases the movie could have been improved by replacing 1/5 of the dialog and narration with well timed pauses.Other than the repetitive and dumbed down script there isn't much to say. The CGI was very hit or miss, the technology and especially the fairy wings looked great but the creature effects and troll looked rushed and goofy. This is especially strange because the narrator (Mulch Diggums) seems to be trying to set a serious, or even gritty, tone for the film.",Artemis Fowl

I saw the commercial for this and thought it looked pretty good, so I gave it a shot. Wow. Utter garbage. I had a terrible time following the plot and it seemed like the first half of the movie was a bunch of exposition and then they suddenly fast forwarded though everything after only giving pieces of information.I felt like the movie spent so much time setting up Artemis only to suddenly and randomly introduce Holly and then spend the rest of the time focusing on her. But there was no backstory for her and I didn't know why any of the characters did anything. Also, what even was your point of Juliet?? She just showed up to make a sandwich and then be in peril. The movie would've been the same without her which stinks because I feel like she has probably a bigger part in the books.During the movie, I leaned over to my friend to ask if I'd missed something. Neither of us had any idea what was going on, and it felt like we'd watched the movie out of order. The wifi cut out with 10 minutes left and we didn't bother to try to finish the movie.I guess I'll have to check out the books for a decent story.",Artemis Fowl

I really wish I did so I didn't have to watch that...
Artemis is cold, calm and collected, always wore a suit, was always thinking ahead.
The first book it was he that discovered the fairy civilization, not his father or his family, his dad was missing which drove his mother insane and she lived in the attic room.
Artemis wanted to steal the fairy gold, not the arcos or whatever mcguffin it was in the film.
Opal wasn't in the first book, or at least if she was it was briefly mentioned as a rival to Foaly.
Artemis didn't know Butler's first name until about the 3rd book when he temporarily died.
Juliet was butler's 16-18 year old sister, not his 12 year old niece.
What happened to Holly to suddenly trust Artemis in the film? Did I miss something? She was all hostile towards him, they had a 30 second conversation and then she trusted him? I don't even...
And don't get me started on Mulch... Described as a short fuzzy creature, not a 6ft tall guy... Also, if I remember, Holly was described as barely being 5ft tall...

My wife turned to me at the end and said ""that was freakin terrible.""I felt nothing for the characters, the story was jittery and Artemis Fowl did nothing.

There is almost no connection to the books, witch I love! They can not have read more than the cower of the book and a list of the names that are in it. There is so many big mistakes that it is painfull to watch.Just a few of the errors I fuond:
1 Artemis is not atletich at all!
2 Butler is Eurasian!
3 Butler is called Butler and Atremis does not get to know his name until a later book.
4 The therapy scene is from book 2
5 Mulch Is not the narrator, and would not be revealing anything about magic to humans.
6 Artemis Sr got lost in the russian sea, and was not kidnapped by a fairy, but Russian mafia.
7 Root is a man, not a woman.
8 Artemis knows his dad is a criminal and he is one himself.
9 Artemis Sr knows nothing about faries or magic.
10 There is no shootout at Fowl Manor between LEP and Butler. And Artemis would rather be inside than out in the field.
11 That is not how a dwarf berd works.
12 The troll fight is all wrong.
13 Mulch escapes from inside the house and is presumed dead.

There are so many things bad about this movie that it is impossible to cover all of them in this one review. The plot is a hodge podge of tidbits from the first three books with visual effects cherry picked at random intervals. The casting,OMG, did they read the books. The father wasn't even in the first book and who is Judi Dench supposed to be. Nobody looks like they were described in the books.Why is Munch Diggums the narrator. The Fowl family business is crime. Artemis stole the fairy gold. Artemis is not a whiny emotional kid. On and on .................. I fully believe Disney should be prosecuted.

860,MartinKellerII,"Eoin Colfer, please choose better who you sell you rights to next time",2,16 June 2020,"Let me start by a simple statement.This film was an absolute butchery of a wonderful piece of literature. This failure is equal if not higher than the one of Eragon(2006). At least Eragon roughly held the profiles of its characters.In this abomination, however, they, for reasons unknown, turned all characters upside down.To be perfectly clear: I am not criticising actors And their performances here. My wrath goes directly to the creative team.Also to list couple of good things about this film: the costumes and props were great. Nice attention to details, well designed etc. (not counting the cage where Holly was held). And the VFX was nice. But that's about it.Now to the scolding:Holly Short is supposed to be the first female LEP recon officer and a lot of the story actually revolves around this fact.Also she is supposed to be 80odd years old (which was actually mentioned in the film) and she was supposed to look like a young adult(which definitely wasn't).Next on the list: Why they killed Angeline Fowl???? She was a side plot of the whole first book and an important figure in most of the others.Foul sr. Should have been lost at sea, and not kidnapped by a fairy. He was supposed to be held in captivity by a russian mafia. It would be probably understandable to put in kidnapping as a dramatic enhancement, but they took a bad guy from another volume and transplanted her into this abomination of an adaptation of the first book.And now we get to the Butler. Where to start?The book clearly states that Butler is supposed to reveal his first name only if he is about to die(which he does in one of the books). The film reveals it straight away asking us to call him by his first name only.Also in the book he is described as large man of Eurasian descent which makes him inconspicuous everywhere. I wouldn't mind filmmakers casting a black man, that can be justified. But what's with that hair and eyes? Can anyone, please, explain, why they made him look like a black aryan?His sister (yes, it was supposed to be a sister, not a niece) was supposed to be a typical teenager (few years older than Artemis).And now to the main culprit of this failure. The main character himself. Artemis Foul.The casting here was actually very good. They could barely find a better suiting actor. But sadly that is the only positive thing I can say.Wearing his tailored suit from the beginning of the books, he always protested wearing casual clothing. And the film shows him in a bloody sweatshirt. And that dramatic gesture when he says I need a suit was probably the worst writing I've ever seen (and yes, I do count The Room).He is supposed to be a criminal mastermind. So why he isn't??In the film they really tuned down the genius of Artemis Foul II. He barely even thinks throughout the whole film. In the book he was a genius with published works on multiple scientific subjects (including psychology) he was always scheming and plotting and that was what made the books so good. The film portrayed him just as a clever kid. When he said I'm a criminal mastermind at the end of the film, my only reaction was: Why??? How can he say that when he never did any masterminding except saying ""I have a plan"" couple of times?He was not supposed to go to school in the first book. He did attend in the second book, but only as a direct consequence of something that happened at the end of the first book, which brings us nicely to Angeline Fowl.There are many more crimes against good judgement, storytelling, adaptation and other fields of good cinematography, but this lament is getting too long.I can't but wonder if they have any plans for the future, because the way they made this torture device they can kiss goodbye the second book (unless they want to revive dead Angeline instead of rescuing kidnapped father again).The bottom line is: technically well done movie with a terrible story and even worse adaptation value.The only truly positive thing I can say about this film is that they didn't kill the mood by shoving a nasty out-of-context song at the beginning of end credits.Mr. Colfer, Me and (I hope) most of your fans would be very much grateful, if you could wrestle the rights out of the hands of Disney and sold them (probably for much more money now ;-) ) to someone, who will be able to make a film that is worthy of your style of writing.",Artemis Fowl

875,noemi-miranda,Unbelievable,1,17 August 2020,"There's no explanation for the complete transformation of the characters, the lost of the sense and north of the novel and the silly adaptation not-based-at-all in story itself. The traumatic experience that Artemis lived and that explains pretty much of his attitude to the world -cynic and cold in appearance- falls under complete oblivion. The distant figure of an absent and demanding father, the warmness of a mother lost, the struggle between his natural caring inner compass and the cruelty of his behavior... nothing of these is present in this movie that shouldn't be called Artemis Fowl. It's absolutely sad.",Artemis Fowl
876,j-mulligan,A Shocking Adaptation,1,15 June 2020,"I love the Artemis Fowl books - they remind me of my childhood and are an engrossing read. However, the film adaptation (as is often the case) is badly done. Not only is it a bad adaptation, it's also a bad film in general. I only managed 30 minutes before I switched off - it was full of bad acting, bad writing and huge omissions or mistakes/changes from the original story. It could have been so good - it's not that difficult of a story to copy, but alas - no. Avoid unless you want to waste some time.",Artemis Fowl

This what would have made the film better was getting a better connection with the characters but still made me laugh in some points.,Artemis Fowl
879,nicole-murch13,Beyond disappointed,1,13 June 2020,Did they even read the books? I adore the Artemis Fowl series and to say this movie is based on the books is an insult. They took the characters and wrote their own story with them that was far inferior to the books. If I was Eoin Colfer id want to punch Kenneth Branagh straight in the face.,Artemis Fowl
880,jpjprun,Trying to match the brilliance of Avatar,1,20 June 2020,This is another case of Hollywood replacing an interesting plot with a generic hero journey.

I was hoping to watch a heist movie, where a prodigy driven by a broken yet wealthy home steals from fantastical creatures long thought as myth.Why is this a 'find dad' movie?Why are the scenes just... so juxtaposed? None of these characters are unique, they're just copy pasted from common stereotypes. Nothing meshes together, and even halfway through the movie (stopped watching at that point) I couldn't tell you who cares about who, or what their direction or character is.This is a sad end to what was a memorable series of books.

Yes, Artemis Fowl, criminal mastermind, all brain and barely enough brawn to walk across a room SURFING. He wears jeans and t-shirts.

So incredibly disappointing.",Artemis Fowl
885,vf_shangool2001,This film is an insult to the fans!,1,15 June 2020,"Ah where do I even begin...Artemis Fowl is a film based on a series of a popular novel. But you see, Disney took away every cool and interesting elements from the book and turned it to a film that doesn't even interest the kids. what we miss in this motion picture you ask?
A wicked criminal mastermind who happened to be a kid (how cool is that?), Genius plans or missions, Exciting actions, Sense of humor (the book was hilarious), cool sci-fi tech (I saw some toys in the film though!), Characterization, Casting (yes director literally ask his gangs from other movies to play the role... how professional), Mediocre designs and directing and the most important part... the main story (with elements of surprise). Companies really need to be more careful with these popular titles. As a book fan not only I did not like the movie, I actually HATED it! We are angry! This motion picture insults each and every fan of the novels. We all know turning a book to a movie is difficult and challenging, But if you can not keep it close enough don't do it.
Bottom Lines:
-I feel sorry for Eoin Colfer (author) for giving up on this project. you should have not agreed your masterpiece to be a movie in the first place. Ask Netflix they know what to do!
Anime Companies could do a hell of a job for crying out loud!",Artemis Fowl

And yes, I know the books are always better - films always change characters, to fit the market. This a film was interesting. Josh Gads narration is annoying tbh, love the fact that Dame Judi is it and Colin Farrel! The reason why the direction of the film is SO squiffy if you read the trivia Harvey Weinstein was the original director and then it got taken over by Kenneth Branagh! So quit your moaning enjoy a family film and continue to read the books! #ArtemisFowl",Artemis Fowl

I loved reading Artemis Fowl even in my late teens, so it was very sad to see the movie do absolutely no justice to the source material. I just can't understand for the life of me, why they had to mess with so many things and blend many books together... The original makes for a great story, what were they trying to achieve with this! It rushes through plot points and doesn't give audience any time to connect with the characters...
I mean, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, and my expectations were pretty high, since I held the books as highly as Harry Potter in its time. At least Haven City looked as I imagined it.

892,karifur-745-816552,Worst book adaptation ever?,1,16 June 2020,"We just watched Artemis Fowl and please allow me to save you from the same fate. I am just completely lost for words to describe what an absolute pile of rubbish that film was. The story made no sense whatsoever. The characters were all completely underdeveloped and their motivation was baffling. They completely changed Artemis entire personality; he is supposed to be a criminal mastermind, but he barely seems like he could successfully plan to steal a kid's bicycle. He's just a boy who is supposedly super smart, but the only reason you know this is because someone else says it about him. And for some reason instead of taking the wonderful, intricate heist storyline that Colfer wrote in the books, they conjured up a villain from a future book in the series... except they didn't even explain who THAT character was or what their motivation was to do what they did.
I don't think I have ever been as disappointed by an adaptation of a book as I was by this drivel. If you have never read the books, you probably won't understand what the heck is going on. If you have read the books, you will understand just enough to be disgusted by the horrible things they have done to it because you know how much better it should have been.
I usually try to separate a film adaptation from a book and judge it on it's own merits, but the only reason I sort of understood what was happening is because I knew what happened in the books. My husband, who had never read them, was totally confused the entire time.

One of the amazing things about the series is how Artemis is redeemed by the end of it.And the relationship being all lovey with his dad? READ THE BOOKS!!I could go on and on, but why?

They clearly showed how to be incredibly smart and he came off as an unstoppable force. In this film however he is just some stupid kid who has daddy issues. His dad is the one who steals things and deals in the underground. He is even the one to discover and find out pretty much everything about faries. The film implies AF jr is a genius but never does anything to show the audience that. He comes off as kind of an idiot damsel in distress rich kid who both gets lucky and is protected by his butler.So to sum up, this film is terrible not only on its own merits as a film but also because it ruins the story told in the first book and most unforgivably, completely ***** all over what the main character was supposed to be.The script for this film is laughably dog**** a 12 year old writing a book report on this novel could have produced a better script.",Artemis Fowl

Just what we needed after a day homeschooling in a lockdown.I actually don't mind that there are some unexplained things in the movie. I watch films to be entertained. In my opinion they don't always have to wrap up every little sub-story and explain every detail. We don't get that in real life. Just accept it and move on.

For those of us who read the book this movie cant be rated low enough. The entire plot is destroyed, character traits and abilities are thrown out the window and run over, and the feel of it is just plain rotten. For the people who haven't read the books don't expect this to be a good movie either. I would say this is worse than a 2000's B rated movie, and this is coming form some one who generally loves B rated movies. The one thing that wasn't completely horrible was the visual effects. You will see that the movie form your stand point is wishy washy and really another disappointment from Disney.

-Mulch is taller than most humans
-Artemis does surf and rides on an electrical skateboard.

Therefore we were both excited to see this movie, only to get about 10 min into it and turn it off out of pure disappointment.

1. Mulch does not narrate the books so wtf is that about?!? No narrator is needed if you followed the damn book. He would also never say anything about magic or fairies to the police/government!!! Like seriously?!? Major foundation of the entire series is that the Mud People (humans) have no idea The People (fairies) exist....except for Artemis and the Butler... because he's a sneaky, genius, wealthy, law breaking teen. 😤
2. Why are they talking about his mom like she's dead - she's not. Just crazy every since dad disappeared.
3. ARTEMIS DOESN'T SURF!
4. EVERYONE CALLS BUTLER, BUTLER!!! Artemis has no idea what his first name is until later books for a specific reason.
I'm not going to continue watching this because I can only imagine the further mistakes you've made and that would be even more upsetting to me. I've been a fan of this series for years now. Breaks my heart. You ruined the Percy Jackson books by Rick Riordan as well.

However those that have read the books will probably have mixed emotions.I'm somewhat basing this review on the fact if nobody has read the book.Artemis doesn't come across as an criminal mastermind, clearly he is simply a smart young boy on a mission to save his father. The plot itself feels a bit mixed between the two books, and whilst we knew this was going to happen, it still feels weird how they mixed it in.I loved the way they introduced Mulch Diggums, and how he introduced us the story of Artemis Fowl. At first, I thought he look more ""Human"" than dwarf but by the mid way point I was somewhat content.To the directors credit, they did keep some of the events and wording from the book, and whilst they changed the plot around the books the plot was passable.The characters choices were very good. Even Commander Root being female worked really well.I absolutely LOVED Haven City! they really got that nailed. Along with the shoots, and all the creatures. Foaly was a little bit different to what I imagined however he still did the job.When I saw the troll, I was really happy with how they created the creature.To all those wanting to watch the movie that have seen the book, go in watching and expect it to be a little bit different.Thanks for reading!",Artemis Fowl

926,rlschell,Supremely bad fanfiction,1,30 June 2020,"I don't normally write reviews, but I was so excited and hopeful about this movie. The novels were a delight, and my entire cadre of friends and family loved them.Unfortunately, I'm guessing that the same people who thought smashing together two of the Prydain Chronicles to make The Black Cauldron was an excellent idea must have worked on Artemis Fowl, only they didn't bother reading the novels first, no. They took the summation given to them by their twelve year old for gospel and thought they'd add in a few things while they were at it. Artemis Fowl wouldn't be caught dead surfing or using a PC instead of Apple or... well. Pretty much 95% of what he's done in this movie. Many of the amazing things Artemis did on his own are now attributed to his father, his mother is dead, Juliette is Butler's sister, he knows Butler's name *and calls him by it*, and that's just the tip of this festering iceberg. The actors obviously tried hard, and I have few general problems with their casting (aside from the fact that Juliette should have been quite a bit older). You can only work with what you're given, though, and it's clear that they weren't given much.I'd heard it wasn't very good, but my sister told me I had to watch it so that I could be as infuriated by it as she was. I did, and I therefore quite clearly am precisely that annoyed. This could have been amazing, but they missed the mark by such a wide margin that I'm fairly certain that they were at least a hundred miles away from it to start. What a miserable horror when it could have been so wonderful. It's a horrible shame and I don't recommend it to anyone who's read the novels for certain. Since I also know people who didn't read the novels who have found it equally confusing, I doubt I'd recommend it if you haven't read them, either.",Artemis Fowl

929,sayantanmarik,Please please please don't waste your time watching this movie,1,23 June 2020,One of the most horrible movies I have ever seen. Nothing makes much sense in this entire movie. I haven't read the books. I am sure those who did will be extremely disappointed.,Artemis Fowl
930,sodonoghue,average,4,18 July 2020,As a fan of the novels from a young age i think the tv show does it no justice. its not the worst tv show and i may watch a second season but removing the cool gadgets from a spy series? are you kidding me? every new book that came out i waited to see what gadgets were next. you turned this into an averyage tv show,Artemis Fowl
931,athanasiou-p,They didn't even try...,1,17 June 2020,"A small introduction to understand my high expectations:
I have read the books as a kid and I was super enthusiastic about the story line. This Christmas, I was back to my parents place, and while passing next to the bookcase, I got a glimpse of the first book. Then I decided to read it again just to have something to pass my time back home. I ended up reading the first two books of the series in three days and I enjoyed every moment of it (I am 30 years old).
So you can imagine my excitement when in January I noticed that there was a movie coming up from Disney. I saw the trailer and it really looked like they had done a good job. Yesterday, I watched the movie and from the first minute I had this feeling that this will not go well. Indeed, through the whole movie, one question was always on my mind: ""Why?"".
First of all, the story-line has been altered quite a lot in comparison to the books. While this could generally be accepted since it is a book adaptation, it seems that they just added a lot of unessential information which just puzzled the viewer to understand what was happening in 1.5 hour running time. There was no build-up of the story, the narration of Mulch was at least annoying and unnecessary, the acting was at best mediocre, while there was a constant try to present clever and fun puns (which admittedly they managed a couple of times).
Generally, it seemed like a movie that they decided to invest on the CGI and not the plot and actors. Even the CGI I didn't really find it to fulfil really high standards.
I don't think that my discomfort was coming from the fact that I have read the books. I believe that even someone that had no clue of the story and watched the movie, could only say that this was just a really bad movie. I cannot help to feel really disappointing, as I feel that they took a story with the highest potential and basically ruined it.",Artemis Fowl
932,matthew_penrose-84863,Butchered,2,4 October 2021,"As a long time fan of the books since the early 2000s, this film makes no sense. I just can't understand why they decided to change so many fundamental elements about the books, not least Artemis Fowl's character, which had they been faithful, would have made the movie so much better. Artemis in a pair of jeans and shirt rather than an expensive suit? Or riding a skateboard of sorts instead of being driven around by a limousine? His character was very smart as well as spoilt by the wealth of Fowl manor, and he lived up to it. In the film, I don't even know who Artemis is and what his motivations are. The film itself is a confusing mess with no character development or reasons between why everything happens - it just sort of... happens, and we're none the wiser for it. I feel like Disney tried to take all the main elements from the books, and then twist to their own agenda, and try to make a single film to represent all of it. The result is an absurd mess with no soul, no connection, and a slap in the face to the fans of the books as well as the author who wrote them.",Artemis Fowl
933,aleksanderlucy,Large negatives outweigh decent aspects to a disjointed 5.,5,14 June 2020,"So to start, this film does have some things going for it. There is generally good production value throughout. It is visually appealing and looks cool in its, limited, locations. And, there is generally solid acting; none are amazing, yet none terrible and Artemis is a sometimes compelling lead.Now for the much greater negative portions of this movie. I can't hate on the plot because of the books plot since I never read the book(s). But, there are issues with character development, plot transitions, and emotional weight; however, I will not dive too deep into these since all share the same root issue: the rushed feeling of the movie. The story is compressed into a measly 1.5 hours and its painfully ruinous. Characters are supposed to capture our emotions and attachment after only a few interactions; far to little time and dialogue is invested into making the audience care. As a result, scenes that should hol weight don't, and you feel little to no emotions when you should. The plot itself is only decent and falls prey to many clichés and predictable turns, but the compressed, rushed nature exasperates many problems. Jumping from scene to scene not only made it hard to connect with the characters, it made the plot feel disjointed and hard to follow. Locations suddenly shift, plans come into existence, and bonds are formed with far too little screen time and dialogue to make sense of it all, again removing some of the weight from scenes.Overall, good aspects carry this film to its minimum score and it is heavily weighed down by its negatives. But, against all odds, it was mildly entertaining throughout and mostly held my attention.",Artemis Fowl
934,roknimohsen,Total garbage,1,12 June 2020,"Somewhere along the movie, you doubt your own memory! Do I remember it right? Or the movie is that non-related to the book??

935,Neyrin,Have the freefolk wipe your memory of the books first...,3,7 November 2020,"If you read the books as a child and loved them, don't watch this film!The film is basically a loosely based adaption, taking characters and overall theme and then just slaughtering the story leaving what seems like a hastily put together mess of CGI and lost opportunities.I could possibly forgive the rewriting of the story, it's not a bad story for a sci-fi/fantasy/adventure film aimed at children, but the complete wash out of all characters is horrible! The characters personalities are not at all portrayed in an accurate way and the relationship between the main characters are so rushed that it does not even resemble the remarkable and strange hate/love f(r)iendship from the books.Maybe I had to high hopes after all these years, and maybe I'm not being fair in judging a film aimed at children when I'm myself nearing 30, but this was a disappointment.",Artemis Fowl
936,malithmadhushan,so much decepointed,4,15 June 2020,At the beginning i was think what a brilliant movie i am so much of time waiting to watch but script is so bad not much curious story. so many hopes about the story line but worst. visual effects are brilliant. but it's also meaning less combine with story line. i hope second movie has those those kind of expectations.,Artemis Fowl
937,mikaylaroyal,Has It's Own Magic,8,12 June 2020,"So, let me start this by saying that I am a huge fan of the series. It was the first series I ever read, so it holds a very special place in my heart. I had huge expectations for this film going into it.The changes of Root and Trouble's characters to females I wasn't a huge part of, but ultimately didn't negatively impact the story or Holly's character arc. Juliet is now Butler's niece instead of his sister, but again, their close relationship is still there. So while I wasn't a fan of the changes, they are what they are and suit the movie. I didn't like the removal of Avangeline Fowl (in the books she is alive, in the movie she has passed away) but it is what it is.The trailers don't do the movie justice, and makes the film look subpar- however the movie was absolutely brilliant.I'll get the things I like out of the way first before I move on to things I didn't like.I really liked the combined storyline of the first and second books, it worked really well.The inclusion of Opal as the antagonist of the first movie was interesting, but really paid off. It worked and introduced her character well.Kenneth's direction was awesome, there was an element of homely movie with the perfect sprinkle of magic. It was quite captivating.Josh Gad enthralled me as Mulch, absolute perfect casting. His comedic timing and the bickering was on point!Ferdia Shaw was excellent as Artemis, he really captured the character. Although I don't know why they made him athletically active, from what I remember in the books he wasn't that gifted when it came to running/fighting. But it works with the movie. I just wish they made him more.... evil, like the books. Book Artemis is quite devious and the movie was missing the devious spark that he had.Lara McDonnell was gorgeous as Holly Short, perfect choice!Nikesh Patel was awesome as Foaly, funny as well as intellectual- the perfect Foaly!
Nonso Anozie was sensational as the Butler we all know and love, really bringing the character to life.The inclusion of Colin Farrell as Artemis Fowl Senior was actually really heartwarming. Their relationship made Artemis somewhat more relatable.Judi Dench as Commander Root just felt....off. Not because of her, she was brilliant, but because Commander Root is a male, and has a lot of quirks that were missing from the film. Dench brought her own flare, however, I just wished she hadn't have gone with the growl-like voice that she had. Maybe it was an attempt to make her seem tough, to make fans more accepting of the change of Root from male to female, but it just didn't work. But, if they were going to cast any actress and a gender-bent Root, Dench was a great choice.Now, the things I didn't like.I really don't like that Artemis and Holly bonded over their fathers. It felt like the Superman/Batman/Martha trope, if you know what I'm talking about).It really would have been nice for the movie to be longer, so they could include more of the story from each of the books. The character development felt very, very fast- as did the friendship development between Holly and Artemis. It felt very forced.All in all, I really enjoyed this film. Fans of the books will enjoy it, I think. It holds it's own without ruining the magic and integrity of the source material (looking at you, The Last Airbender). Give it a try!",Artemis Fowl

(odd pacing at times, bland/generic dialogue, poor character development)... but the story is somewhat interesting, there's some decent acting, pretty nice fairy world design (yet a bit underdeveloped), decent cgi... all in all, the kids enjoyed it.

I will admit that the character and story background (or building) is not there in any strong sense.

After loving the books for so long and waiting over a decade for a movie, I think I'm still going to be waiting. This is going to be another book to movie adaption that I pretend doesn't exist. They took the names of our beloved characters and threw their personalities and any thoughts of character development out of the window. The movie doesn't explain why Holly is suddenly friends with Artemis or the Butlers, Artemis is less of an evil genius and more of a angsty 12 year old. Did they add Artemis Sr so much just to include Colin Farrell? Poor decisions. Honestly, if you loved or even slightly liked the books, don't waste your time.

Root being female (basically Vinyaya)
Butler being a black guy (pretty sure that's not normal Eurasian genetics)
Dad being in this story
The Kelp siblings gender change
Cutting the lollipop line..If the movie had been good, it would be easy to overlook, but not only am I distracted EVERY TIME Mulch is on screen, the plot is in SHAMBLES.
What the hell is Arty doing surfing, and biking, and AIMING! The boy can't shoot to save his life! (Not at 12 anyway)
WHY does he know Butler's first name? IT'S supposed to be a secret so they don't bond and he can be a more effective BODYGUARD! (Anyone who read the book knows how that went, but still)
WHAT THE HELL is this Auculos nonsense?
WHAT THE HELL is Timmy doing?! (I actually would have maybe managed if they'd done this as the dad was Arty and the kid was the 3rd!)
Why is Doctor Poe even here, they don't actually do anything with that, and it was a plot point that meant something in the book...I could keep going, but I'll just leave you with this instead..What?! Arty is a pilot too?! Okay, this might actually be in the book, but it's been a while since I read book 8.
Oh, yes, for those who don't know, they have totaled this SO badly, we COULD have had another 'HARRY POTTER' length run of these. Instead I hope it gets the axe BEFORE Percy Jackson's mashed run did... 8 books that could have been BEAUTIFUL!Actually, Netflix saved another series that was killed before it started, maybe they should buy it from Disney, cause THIS wasn't worth the time and money... They could do Percy too...",Artemis Fowl
947,pahooboy-11541,"Atemis Fowl, a Horror Movied?",1,14 June 2020,"I watched half the movie through my fingers as if I was watching a horror movie. That is not an exaggeration or an embellishment. Ask my wife. Every time she came into the room, she asked, ""What are you doing? Is it scary?"" Every scene that put one of my beloved characters in a different light than what we all know, I couldn't help but react with revulsion and horror. Again, my wife would ask, ""Who are you yelling at?""
My bone a fides: I've listened to, not read, all 8 books at least a half dozen times. (Yeah, I ride my bike a lot.) However, I did the same thing with Harry Potter, and I was never disappointed with the movies.
Don't get me wrong, I don't expect movies to follow the books exactly. Favorite scenes and characters are cut out to make for story line continuation because of a limited time. I understand that. But, to completely change character idiosyncrasies (Artemis lingo there), it's just off-putting. Artemis surfboarding - really? We are reminded throughout the series how he has ""two left feet."" Domovoi Butler? We hear Butler's first name in the first 15 minutes of the movie? We didn't learn how important we SHOULDN'T know that until the third book. Atemis' mother is dead? How do you carry out book six, The Time Paradox? Was Disney thinking that it could only get one movie out of the books?
In the movie, Artemis shows empathy. In the books, we know that Artemis isn't capable of experiencing empathy. He is such a genius, that he can't understand why people don't have empathy for him when he sees the universe as it is and everyone else is oblivious to what is going on around them.

I watched it without reading any reviews so I went into this movie with an open mind. I honestly thought the first act, while it had a muddled pacing, was actually quite good. It did a good job introducing the world and I began to feel excited and nostalgic about delving into this world once again. Moving into the second and third act however, the plot started to lose me and I felt like any meaningful character development stopped. I did not have a problem with some of the character changes that others seemed to have (eg. Commander Root being a woman, Juliet being the niece instead of the sister) but it became clear that there was much more emphasis on the McGuffin chase and just lost my interest. I do not however agree that this is the worst adaptation ever made that others seem to think. The books were targeting an age group of preteen children and that seemed to be the same demographic that Disney was targeting with this movie. Perhaps it's because all of the fans of this book series are probably adults like myself that I'm seeing so much disappointment with this movie, because it clearly wasn't made for us. I think Disney needs to figure out who will be wanting to watch this franchise if they are going to move on with sequels but personally, I would very much love to see The Arctic Incident with some improvements that Disney will hopefully learn from the reception of this film.",Artemis Fowl

Definitely not deserving of all the hate though. They could have had an amazing movie on their hands. The books are great and I loved them when I was younger. But Disney chose to go the more profitable route of pitching it to children instead of us who are adults and loved the book, and who are also able to post reviews online. Please don't listen to the trolls who are saying it is the worst movie ever, it really isnt. But I hope that it could inspire kids to want to read the way better movies like Harry Potter did. Again I am disappointed at what this movie could have been but don't listen to the haters and give it a shot. Especially if you have kids, because at the end of the day they will enjoy it and not be so freaking critical! I am glad that I didn't pay money to see this in the theater though.

Just...wow.Artemis Fowl is a complete departure from the books. Fine. Ok. The trailers gave me a heads up on that so all the movie needed to do was be good. And by ""good"" I mean be entertaining and coherent.But it wasn't. It can't. And it only has itself to blame.Abandoning the books' arcs meant completely rewriting the story: People's relationships, their motives, their arcs, and their major plot points. This might have been fine, except it comes off feeling as though they're rushing to cram several stories into this one movie.If they were planning to stick to the source material, I could kind of understand why they might do that; after all, the movie would probably be seen by people who'd read the books, and they'd forgive the plot holes and badly done exposition because their knowledge of the books would fill in the gaps.But this movie's writers and directors knew this movie wasn't for people who'd read the books, because they were the ones who rewrote and directed it! So the movie must be for people who are completely unfamiliar with the books. Right?Except it can't be for them because the movie's idea of world building and story telling is to rush from one character introduction and one situation to the next... as if the viewer already knows who these characters are and what they're doing, so let's get on with it thank you very much.So who's this movie for? It's directed with a nod and wink as though it's made specifically for people who love the books. But it abandoned the source material, so fans of the books are just as in the dark as people meeting these characters for the very first time.It's not for kids. There's just to much new information to absorb in such a short amount of time. So we're back to the same problem of making a movie as though it's an homage to the books, but making the creative choice to make the movie nothing like the books.Could've been great.

There is so much in the books to get across that they could never have achieved it in one film especially if you've built up a specific image for the characters from reading. I did enjoy the film and it has been set up for a sequel should they decide to make one, which I hope they do. If you want a perfect rendition of the books you will be disappointed but if you want a nice film based on characters from the book then it's ok. The best way of describing it for me would be that it's more like The Hobbits adaption for film than Lord of the Rings was.",Artemis Fowl
972,mickkenworthy,Great family movie,10,18 June 2020,"Watched with the kids and it was great. I hadn't heard of this book or film and so we had no preconceptions. Kids loved it. It was pretty amusing and even funny in places. Worth watching just for Dame Judy saying 'top ov d'morning'. All this bleating about it is ridiculous. It's a film, watch it and pipe down. Other reviews are searching for artistic merit and depth somewhere it's not supposed to be. I have seen films rated 1 or 2 ( or the first few minutes) and this does not deserve ratings like that. Honestly,, probably a 6-7. Story is good, visually, you believe the trolls n fairies are real and it keeps moving along at a reasonable pace. I think the lockdown must have made the crazies crazier. Well worth giving the film a try and if you don't like it, switch it off and try to find something better. Good luck with that .",Artemis Fowl

976,rwysocki-17893,I cannot believe they did this to Artemis Fowl,1,13 June 2020,"I am a kid who for the past few weeks has been reading the Artemis Fowl series and I love it! But this movie is a disgrace. Movie producers no longer give enough credit to the books. The producers think that this was a good movie then they are dead wrong. The fact that they had a cliff hanger at the end made it worse. They expect to make a sequel but most reviews are horrible so that adds the effect that we never get to know how it ends. The only good representation of this beloved series is the character names and the kidnapping. I can not believe I looked forward to this. Every line of dialogue enraged me, what is this about aculos, why would Julius root be female and not cast Judi Dench, and why did the producers put a small version of hagrid in this? At times I thought he was going to say Harry instead of Artemis. I mean, I can speak for the reviewers when I say this movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. It was just a bad movie.",Artemis Fowl
977,pablosky-forero,"Good world, horrid pace, missing characters",7,12 June 2020,"So I gave it its rating because the current one (3,3) its too low. It should be 5,6 or close. Terrible. But not dumpster fire.Why did they think they could introduce a new world, new characters and develop a plot line in less than 90mins?!?!?!What they could build of the fantasy world looked well done, and special effects looked really good. But everything felt rushed. It's all exposition. Hardly a single second of character building or just atmosphere. All is rushed and ""unless it 100% needs to be in, its out"".Maybe with an extra hour we could have gotten something decent. But what we got is the equivalent of someone trying to tell you about the book while on speed.",Artemis Fowl
978,Brilliantly_Mad,Books-to-movie adaptation similar to Eragon or Percy Jackson. Disappointed book fan.,4,28 June 2020,"I was so hopeful for this movie.
As a stand-alone movie to someone who has never read the books, it's pretty good. To anyone who remembers the books, it messed with the books pretty badly. Butchering plot lines across books to fit the view of movie makers who have never picked up the books, shoving things where they ought not to be.
Read the books for a brilliant, well written story.",Artemis Fowl

Normally I would rate it with an 8, but I have given it a 10 when seeing so much unjustified hatred, you seriously rate this 1/10 and in a gang like thugs. I understand that I may like it more or less, disappoint some, but that qualification is cruel and disrespectful to all the talented professionals who have left part of their lives in this movie.",Artemis Fowl
980,jethrodimeo,Arguably the worst movie of 2020,1,23 August 2020,At least they have COVID-19 to blame. This movie is a waste of time. Do yourself a favor and skip it.,Artemis Fowl
981,billandsusan-35276,Did anyone associated with this film read the books?,1,14 June 2020,This was such a disappointment that I can't even call it a remotely reasonable attempt to depic the stories. Setting aside the books it's hard to find a redeeming plot or character development that can stand on it's own. Epic fail is my vote!,Artemis Fowl
982,micashapica,"Horrible on its own, HEARTBREAKING to Artemis Fowl fans",1,14 June 2020,"I've been waiting for this adaptation since the books first came out. Here we are a few decades later and they ruined EVERYTHING! Renaming characters, changing their names, changing the character genders, changing the character personalities... it was awful... it was painful to watch, and it was heartbreaking. It's like Avatar the last airbender adaptation all over again. They hired a CHILD to play Holly Short. A freaking child! There are too many things wrong with this movie to go into it all, but the biggest let down was the whole ""let's invent our own take on these characters"". They COMPLETELY changed Root. There is no cigar, there is no yelling, there is no him turning red... oh, and he's a she now with a raspy voice and not very mobile either... like that heck? Why would you ruin such great characters? Butler is being called BY HIS REAL NAME the whole time and his little sister doesn't have her iconic braid with the metal ring. Oh, and they are not Eurasian either. He's a black dude with pale blue eyes and white hair. And he's not buff, he's just chubby. The Mulch... omg it's Olaf from Frozen. He was big and looked human and the hair was weird... omg... like why? Why would you RUIN such great characters? Don't get me started on Artemis. He had a British accent throughout the whole film and he is into sports and likes surfing? And he's into martial arts now too lol like he doesn't have Butler for that. The acting was shallow, the story was fast paced, a LOT of scenes from the trailer were missing. Nothing was explained, like the fairy book with their rules, Holly short is played by a child. She acts like one too, screaming at the top of her lungs topside. She's a fraking special forces cop officer person and she's going woohoo when she's flying in front of humans?! She's a trained professional for crying out loud, not a kid... anyhow, there are a LOT of things wrong with the movie. It's a horrible adaptation and it's bad for new fans too. It got worse and worse as it progressed. It was heart breaking to watch. I am glad I did not pay to watch it... the acting was shallow, there was no emotional connection between ANY of the characters, the plot was changed as well as characters... if I had made this movie I would be ashamed...",Artemis Fowl

985,kevinstewartatkinson,Very Disappointed,1,14 June 2020,"It's been years since I read the books, so I may have overestimated how good they were. But this movie was absolutely terrible, nothing that was good about the books was included, and the writing was lazy and the nothing in the story felt important. Artemis is not a criminal mastermind, Holly was immature, Butler was bumbling, and Diggums was a pathetic version of Jack Black. None of the characters had an arch. This movie should have never been made.",Artemis Fowl
986,kelanonuallain,One for the Garbage Fairy,2,9 July 2020,"Putting aside all the book inaccuracies for a moment and appraising on filmmaking alone; this movie is an atrocious piece of work. Incomprehensible character decisions and character arc's, really poor editing, rubbish performances and some, quite frankly, ropey CGI - are just some of the many, many flaws. Firstly we don't spend enough time with Artemis to believe he is capable of anything he does in the film, bar some exposition on how he's a chess grand champion or something, nor does he demonstrate in any way that he is a 'Criminal mastermind' throughout the entirety of the run time, it's all very confusing and forced. Some of the sets and ideas around the fairy world are ok, but again, we don't spend enough time anywhere (but the mansion) to even explore them... The only levity brought by any character throughout is Mulch Diggums, whos Deadpool-esqe quips are all too sparse and feel maybe a little out of place or wasted in this film. Judi Dench and Colin Farrell also phone their performances in big time...",Artemis Fowl
987,mcaldwell-48731,Not worth the time and glad it was straight to streaming,1,28 June 2020,Disney have not made many bad films but this is firmly on that list. I have not read the book and knew very little about the story prior to watching the film. After watching the film I still know very little as it force fed me the setting and background information without developing any characters. The first film in a series is supposed to be the development of the story. This one may be the end of the series if anyone from Disney is taking notice of how it is received.I am glad I didn't pay to go to the cinema to see this as I would have been asking for a refund.,Artemis Fowl
988,annidgrieger,Fantastic kids' film,9,21 June 2020,I understand those who read the book wanted something different but I thoroughly enjoyed watching this little caper with the added bonus of seeing Dame Judy French absolutely enjoying herself throughout the film.

989,wooda-56336,Disney what?,1,13 June 2020,"Okay, Disney you are a monopoly company and own literally all of the money but somehow your execs can't read? Because they clearly didnt read the book series. This is not Artemis Fowl. We would rather you NOT ruin our childhood stories than spit out money grabbing films that are all the same because you are more comcerned with a formula than you are with being accurate or making a meaninful movie.",Artemis Fowl
990,FiresLight,Most tragic waste of potential I've ever seen,3,29 November 2020,"For a child, I'd say it's cringe-inducing but relatively entertaining.It was like they took a class on Story Theory and mashed in all of the elements in too short a time. Sloppy and rushed writing and directing. CGI hidden in shadow a lot of the time. Time was a huge restraint, but so much garbage could have been cut.It's nothing like the books, obviously. Some of the changes had so much potential, and others made it worse.One of the greatest tragedies the movie tried sooooo hard to adopt was Eoin Colfer's seamless mesh of ancient Irish fairy tale magic and science fiction. The movie's compromise was to talk a lot about magic at the beginning with gorgeous shots of Ireland and Irish music, contrasted with Artemis randomly surfing in modern gear. Or, if they talked about magic, it was in hushed voices filled with awe, which actually undermined them as strong characters we could take seriously.Artemis Fowl II, intentions: a professional criminal mastermind, but more likable than in the books
Result: Artemis is no hardened criminal. In fact, he commits 2 crimes total, both to rescue someone he cares about. Also, just kidding, they totally weren't going for professional, unless that means wearing a suit and calling people. He gives lines that no self-respecting child would, like when his dad is teaching him about fairies: ""All I want...is to believe in YOU."" While Colfer's Artemis has vampire-pale skin and shuns society, apparently an outdoorsy, surfing Artemis was predicted to be more likable.Domovoy Butler, Artemis' best friend and bodyguard: goes by ""Butler"" in the books to indicate a sense of natural professionalism. In the movie, he goes by ""Dom"" to...indicate their close friendship...?Mulch Diggums, intentions: the comic relief and mysterious narrator.
Results: 80% of his jokes fell flat, 5% of which were cringey. But that still leaves 20% decent content. He had a confusing role trying to convey mystical secrets and comedy, so either you couldn't take him seriously or couldn't laugh.Artemis Fowl I, father, intentions: give the movie a more clear plot outline than the books and provide a more dynamic familial role than an ailing mother.
Result: clear plot conflict successful! Took authority from Artemis as being the man of the house. Awkward, unclear relationship.Holly Short, intentions: epic, pretty fighter and Artemis' arch frienemy
Results: fight scenes good, but there was no reason for Artemis to make himself an enemy. As one of my favorite book characters, she wasn't completely ruined, and it was nice to see her come to life on screen.I don't even know why they introduced Butler's little sister other than to have another POC in the film. Making Commander Root a woman was another easy score for diversity, although it really did work better than the disaster everything else was.You know Chekhov's saying: ""If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired""? There were dozens of proverbial guns that were immediately fired. A missing fairy journal written by his father... I literally texted my bf, ""All we need are a music box and a key."" 2 minutes later, with the help of an encoded song, they find the journal. Also, an object is called, ""a skeleton key to the entire universe."" Yeah, not dramatic at all. I can only thank heaven that there was not a romantic interest.",Artemis Fowl

They are worth more your time than this. The voice over goes on for almost the whole movie.Simply put this TITLE had the potential to be ranked among the top block busters the likes of Harrypoter,Narnia.....such a shame. you simply can not connect the plot,parts of the trailer are not shown on the brighter side we got to see Mulch Diggums at work that is Gold.",Artemis Fowl

997,sureshgn-83472,Review from someone who has not read the books,7,12 June 2020,"First off, this is a kids movie; not for grown ups. Most folks who grew up on the Artemis Fowl books is probably not in the demographic for this movie anymore. Yes the dialog is very often really corny; and some of the sequences are really silly (e.g. the troll fight). Ror someone who has never read the books, it sets up a clear introduction to the principles of the world. Movies like Bright failed in some sense because the mythos was never clear. The special effects are used well - while not being truly unique, they serve the story well. Would recommend to let your 10-15 year old kids watch the movie, and listen to what they have to say about the movie, rather than relying on original readers of the series.",Artemis Fowl

1001,charlesderflinger,Horrible,1,14 June 2020,"The film adaptation is horrible, characters development was in consistent with the books. Example Artemis wouldn't Surf, he was a criminal mastermind in the body of a kid, Butler was Butler and suppose to be the likes of inhuman juggernaut. The only character that was close to the books was Juliet in her 15seconds. Story content mixed and matched excerpts from different books creating inconsistencies (pick one story and run with it). And stay closer to the books and what made Artemis who he was. Had so much potential to be a great film series But falls short next time read the books.",Artemis Fowl
1002,johnallred,In my top 3 of worst movies ever,1,13 June 2020,"This is Stockholm Syndrome: The Movie. Holly Short is shot, captured, kidnapped, and caged. Then during a conversation of a few minutes she and Artemis Fowl become best friends. What?! I wish that was the worst part of the movie. Unfortunately the CGI was crappy, the acting was atrocious, the storyline was nonsensical. I could go on, but this movie was flat out terrible.I can't figure out who is the target audience of this movie.I am a fan of the book and I hated it.My wife has never read the book and she also hated it.Who is left?You would think that after Mortal Engines, Percy Jackson, Enders Game, The Last Avatar, Eragon, etc. that studios would be able to figure out how to properly adapt books of these types to the big screen. Apparently not.",Artemis Fowl
