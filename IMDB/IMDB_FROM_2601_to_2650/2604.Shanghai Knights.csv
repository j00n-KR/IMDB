0,Leofwine_draca,Lacklustre sequel with a bitter vibe,4,16 December 2016,"Seriously lightweight, this sequel to the better SHANGHAI NOON is very much a mish-mash of all the Jackie Chan films you've ever seen before, albeit with a rich backdrop: London of 1887. So far so good, and the UK capital does look very lavish and spellbinding, if perhaps a little tooclean and Americanised? When will films finally realise that the prostitutes of this period were in their 40s and looked at least twenty years older, thanks to all the diseases and hard lives they lived? Anyway, despite the setting – which is really only present so that the viewer can be inundated with dozens of 'cultural' jokes – it's very much business as usual, as Chan tracks down the murderer of his father, Wilson just kind of ambles along, lots of policemen and villains get involved and things end with a high-rise climax, just like in RUSH HOUR actually.The only thing that makes this film worthwhile is Chan. While the action here is another step down from the kind of frenetic frenzies we remember from the 1980s, Chan's in his element, looking good, sounding good and engaging in some amusing homages to his inspirations – Buster Keaton, SINGING IN THE RAIN, Harold Lloyd and more. He even gets to visit the clock-tower set-piece of PROJECT A, except this time it's done on a far bigger scale, taking place inside Big Ben. My money's still on the earlier film as having the edge, though. Chan's martial arts are limited to some horseplay in some revolving doors and a few small scale fights, where he utilises dozens of props in his battle with multiple opponents – the market dash is another highlight and the emphasis is very much on the scenery rather than Chan's hand-to-hand skills. Saying that, there IS one decent martial arts fight against villain Donnie Yen, a Hong Kong hero in his own right; it is very well choreographed, but the editor keeps cutting away to mundane stuff with Wilson and other characters! Man, if they'd just stuck to a single ten-minute fight scene between these two guys, the film would have probably got the highest mark possible.A big detraction in this film is Wilson, whose lovable persona seems to have been dropped in favour of a bitter bore, whose sole purpose in the film is to flirt with women and make anti-British jokes. Wilson is horribly bad and most British viewers will just want to beat the tar out of him after he just keeps going on and on about how the Americans won the Revolution, tea-drinking, and morethis is the kind of rubbish you hear on Internet forums, not Hollywood films! Still, no doubt American viewers will find it absolutely hilarious. What is even more offensive than the humour is the amount of historical inaccuracies present in the film; Charlie Chaplin becomes a street urchin, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle suddenly isn't Scottish anymore – let alone the fact that he never was a police detective, the main villain is a poseur with a distinctly non-Victorian hairstylethe list goes on. I have a horrible suspicion that the teen generation are going to grow up thinking this film spoke the truth, and that the name 'Sherlock Holmes' was invented by a Yankee cowboy There are one or two entertaining jokes within the movie, including Fann Wong (pretty but oh-so-shallow)'s midnight encounter with Jack the Ripper, and a nice martial arts brawl taking place at Madame Tussaud's, complete with dummies falling to bits and more. But whenever Wilson's on screen, the whole thing just falls flat, and Chan's only half the martial artist he once was, so in hindsight I'd probably give this flick a miss.",Shanghai Knights
1,SnoopyStyle,Chemistry still good,6,19 July 2014,"It's 1887. In the Forbidden City, Lord Rathbone (Aidan Gillen) kills Chon Wang's estranged father, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Rathbone is in league with rebel Wu Chow. Chon Wang's sister Chon Lin (Fann Wong) fails to protect the Seal and promises to retrieve it. Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is the sheriff in Carson City, Nevada. He rejoins Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and finds that he has lost all of their money. They make their way to London to find Wang's sister. Rathbone is scheming to get the royal crown. They find Lin in jail after a failed attempt to kill Rathbone. Wang vows to avenge his father's death.It still has the great Jackie Chan stunts. More than ever, he is dancing rather than fighting. What makes it truly fun is his great chemistry with Owen Wilson. They are still terrific together. The story isn't anything to write home about. The movie is great with Owen joking around and Jackie jumping around. However it is problematic in between the funny moments.",Shanghai Knights
2,lee_eisenberg,the Wild East,10,12 July 2006,"In this really fun sequel, Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) go to England to stop an assassin from killing Queen Victoria at her royal jubilee, and they meet many famous Brits of the era (e.g., Jack the Ripper). Like the first movie, ""Shanghai Knights"" is a litany of hilarious, chop-socky, buddy comedy-action flick, with Jackie Chan throwing punches in every direction. True, almost everything in the movie is an anachronism, but that's OK since this is a goofy comedy. This movie equalled its predecessor just as ""Rush Hour 2"" equalled its predecessor. Really fun.A movie star named Chon Wang. Could work.",Shanghai Knights
3,jboothmillard,Shanghai Knights,5,31 August 2009,"Shanghai Noon was a good fun twist on the western theme mixing both the traditions and martial arts, and this sequel is just as fun. Basically Chinese rebels murder the Father (Kim S. Chan) of Chon Lin (Fann Wong), sister of course of Chon Wang (Jackie Chan), and when he hears, he, along with his partner Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) are determined to find those responsible. They end up in London, England looking for the villains, soon to be helped out and annoyed a little by young street Charlie Chaplin (Aaron Johnson) and Insp. Artie Doyle (Thomas 'Tom' Fisher), oh, and Lin too. As the story unfolds, they find out about a plot to take the crown from Queen Victoria (Gemma Jones) by royalty member Lord Nelson Rathbone (Aidan Gillen). So it is not a mission to stop him in his dastardly plot by getting back the precious Imperial Seal, but also avenge Chon's father. With just as many good giggles, fight scenes (including one spoofing Singin' in the Rain), and Chan and Wilson still good making a good buddy duo, it is a likable sequel. Worth watching!",Shanghai Knights
4,Tweekums,Chon and Roy go to London,8,24 April 2019,"This sequel to 'Shanghai Noon' opens in China's Forbidden City with protagonist Chon Wang's father being attacked killed by an English man who steals the Imperial seal. Wang's sister Lin writes to him to inform him what happened; he then heads to New York where he is reunited with his friend Roy. The two of them continue to London where Wang hopes to confront his father's killer and retrieve the seal. Here they uncover two plots; the thief was Lord Nelson Rathbone, tenth in line to the throne, and he is plotting to have those above him killed by Wu Chow, the Chinese Emperor's illegitimate brother, who he in turn will put on the Chinese throne. Wang is also reunited with his sister, who plans to kill Rathbone. Plenty of entertaining action is guaranteed before the final confrontation.If you enjoyed 'Shanghai Noon' you are almost certain to enjoy this; conversely if you thought that was too silly you are unlikely to find this any better. I personally enjoyed the first film and enjoyed this too; there laughs throughout the film. The best of these are during the highly choreographed fight sequences; the one based on a famous scene from 'Singin' in the Rain' was a particular delight. The cast does a fine job; Jackie Chan is on great form as Wang and Owen Wilson is a lot of fun as Roy. Fann Wong impresses as Chon Lin, Aiden Gillen is suitably over the top as Rathbone and Donnie Yen is good, if underused, as Wu Chow. Overall I'd say that if you like fairly slapstick action and plenty of not-so-subtle references to various real people in a fictional setting then you should enjoy this; definitely a must see for fans of Jackie Chan's Hollywood films.",Shanghai Knights
5,ma-cortes,Entertaining and funny movie with two sympathetic and charming protagonists,6,5 July 2005,"This second part is a follow-up to ¨Shangai noon¨with the likeable starring(Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson) . When the killers murder Chon's estranged father he flees. He goes London to retrieve a brilliant royal object that Jackie Chan's father guarded in the forbidden city Pekin when he was murdered by some Chinese rebels . Roy also escapes to England, and he and Chon make their way to London with revenge on their minds. And Chon's sister, Lin, has the same idea. They meet Victoria queen (Gemma Jones) and a roguish street boy called Charles Chaplin . They'll confront the villains (Aidan Gillen and Donnie Yen) which want to overthrow the British and China thrones and nasty Chinese Boxers and even Jack the Ripper (Oliver Cotton). Meanwhile, Owen Wilson falls in love with Chan's sister (Fam Wong).Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson give a jolly and perfect couple . It's usual in Chan films create duos , a ¨buddy movie¨ type , as male : Chris Tucker (Rush hour I and II) , as female : Jennifer Love Hewitt (the Tuxedo) and Claire Forlani (The medallion) and here magnificently with Wilson . Here they uncover a worldwide conspiracy to murder the royal family but almost no one will believe them . The choreographic fights are excellent , they are made as musical numbers, there are remembrances to ¨singing in the rain¨dancing as well as Harold Lloyd , Keistone cops and to author Arthur Conan Doyle with his Sherlock Holmes creation . It's an agreeable picture but uneven comedy, works better when Jackie Chan goes into the action . It's a Chan vehicle for the continuous struggles in leaps and bounds .The final confrontation among the starring and the enemies on the Thames river with fireworks background and in the Big clock tower are overwhelming and breathtaking . Cinematography (Adrian Biddle) and music (Randy Edelman) are spectacular and atmospheric.
Production set is extraordinary, it's very well designed
along London epoch . The picture was rightly directed by David Dobkin. Rating : Nice and bemusing .",Shanghai Knights
6,zardoz-13,"""Knights"" Tops ""Noon""",8,5 August 2009,"The hilarious Jackie Chan & Owen Wilson action comedy ""Shanghai Knights"" captures the light-hearted lunacy of those classic Bob Hope western comedies ""The Paleface"" (1948) and ""Son of Paleface"" (1952). ""In Shanghai Knights,"" our hapless heroes constantly make clowns of themselves in outrageous outfits, and barely have enough time to catch their breath because the cunning villains hold the upper hand. Indeed, the Alfred Gough and Miles Millar screenplay adheres to the familiar formulaic fracas about strangers-in-a-strange-land who find themselves out-manned as well as out-gunned and must navigate an arduous obstacle course of cliffhanger proportions. At the same time, Shanghai Knights"" relies on saddle-sore clichés, such as the one about the bad guys who murder the protagonist's poor old pappy. Of course, the lead vows to punish them! Naturally, a priceless cultural treasure is at stake, too.Aside from some occasional profane language of a PG-13 variety, this lavishly-mounted, seriocomic melodrama boasts the best marital arts choreography of any American-made Jackie Chan movie, along with the presence of ""Iron Monkey"" star Donnie Yen. The computer-generated long shots of London, England, which approximate the look of the late 1880s, are impressive, while Adrian Biddle's stunning widescreen cinematography is a treat for the eyes. If you missed the original ""Shanghai Noon"" (2000), Shanghai Knights"" catches you up about everything relevant to the narrative. Ultimately, what differentiates this 107-minute cowboys-in-England comedy from any recent farces is its reckless disregard for realism, historical veracity, and the laws of gravity. Nevertheless, ""Clay Pigeons"" director David Dobkin serves up this buffoonery with such consummate style that its clichés and conventions contribute to rather than detract from audience expectations.In ""Shanghai Noon,"" a pint-sized but obedient Imperial Guardsman named Chon Wong (Jackie Chan of ""Rush Hour"") embarks on a cultural odyssey to the wild and woolly West to free a beautiful Chinese princess kidnapped by her tutor. Chon Wong (pronounced John Wayne) teams up with sympathetic 'Butch Cassidy' type outlaw Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson of ""Bottle Rocket"") after his gang of owl hoots double-cross him. Together, Chon and Roy rescue the heroine and vanquish the vile villains. As ""Shanghai Knights"" opens, Chon still wears the tin star as the sheriff of Carson City, Nevada. Meanwhile, Roy has headed back east to New York City and has written dime novels about his dubious exploits. Half-way around the world in distant China, an outcast Wu Chan (Donnie Yen) steals the Great Seal and stabs Chon's father in cold blood when the senior tries to stop him. Chon's gorgeous, heretofore unknown sister Chon Lin (Singapore-born actress-singer-model Fann Wong) wires Chon about his dad's death and pursues the villains to cosmopolitan London. Promoting his deputy to sheriff, Chon heads off to New York City to find Roy.Roy has made a mess of his life and earns his income as a lowly waiter. When our heroes arrive in England, they deal with a gallery of Charles Dickens type characters as well as some real-lifers. One of the more humorous scenes shows what happens when Jack the Ripper falls prey to a high-kicking martial arts babe. During the screwball shenanigans, Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon meet Arthur Conan Doyle, before the author wrote the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, drop in on Queen Victoria, and foil an assassination. Talk about a whirlwind of events! Jackie Chan plays tribute to his all-time favorite comedians and dancers in ""Shanghai Knights."" Chan cavorts with an umbrella a la Gene Kelly in an imaginative homage to ""Singing in the Rain,"" while he battles his assailants. Later, Chon dangles helplessly from the Big Ben clock tower like famed silent movie comedian Harold Lloyd did in ""Safety Last"" (1923). As Roy and Chon struggle to smuggle themselves out of New York, Jackie adroitly thwarts Gotham police dressed, appropriately enough for the era, like the Keystone Cops in a revolving hotel door. The way that our hero eludes and handcuffs the cops in the revolving door gag is priceless. When Chan isn't generating more than enough giddy-up in terms of his own unique acrobatic antics, Wilson indulges in his giddy-yap brand of verbal wit, spouting words and phrases coined in the 1960s that were never uttered in the 1880s. ""Shanghai Knights"" features modern-day music on its soundtrack as if to make this semi-kung fu western palatable for contemporary tastes. Altogether, as sequels go, ""Shanghai Knights"" surpasses ""Shanghai Noon.""",Shanghai Knights
7,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A typical Jackie Chan movie,7,22 February 2004,"This is the typical Jackie Chan action kung-fu buddy comedy, pretty much. There are no big changes to the typical formula, but people who've enjoyed the earlier films in the genre, by Jackie Chan. The plot is nothing totally special, though it does build on something that actually happened during the time this is supposed to take place. The acting is pretty much what you'd expect from this type of movie and these actors; nothing great, but nothing really bad either. The characters are mostly just different types of comic relief or dramatic effect, none of them very believable, but once again, it's pretty much what you'd expect from this type of movie. The humor is the usual for Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, nothing more, nothing less. The film isn't specifically interesting or attention-grabbing, but it's fun and thoroughly entertaining, so if that's what you're looking for in a film, then this is an ok choice. Not the best, but there are a lot of worse films. I'd recommend this to any fans of Jackie's previous films, or of Owen Wilson's humor. It's entertaining, if you're into this type of film. 7/10",Shanghai Knights
8,anaconda-40658,Shanghai Numb.,3,4 May 2015,"Shanghai Knights (2003): Dir: David Dobkin / Cast: Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Fann Wong, Aidan Gillen, Donnie Yen: Sequel to Shanghai Noon with a title that suggests storybook themes in a way that Owen Wilson attempts to impress people with bogus adventures, plus it references classic films and actors. Yet it is still just a series of set pieces and tired plotting. The Chinese Seal is stolen and Jackie Chan's father is murdered. His sister pursues the killers to London where an assassination is planned. Chan and Owen Wilson reunite and various stunts and action sequences follow. Standard issue plot with David Dobkin doing well as director. Hopefully he will move beyond this. Chan combines action and humour. Wilson throws out one-liners and delusional fantasies. Unfortunately they are merely reciting what worked better during their western outing. Fann Wong is skilled as Chan's sister who pursues her father's killer. She is the one interesting role in the film and it is still not enough to make this watchable. Villains are unfortunately standard with Aidan Gillan leading the pack. He is about as frightening as Elmer Fudd less the personality. Because Rush Hour spawned a sequel, I suppose they figured out of fairness, why not sequel Shanghai Noon. The result is a well made comedy that serves as nothing more than a pointless sequel. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Shanghai Knights
9,movieman_kev,"Almost as good as ""Noon"", but not quite",7,14 March 2005,"Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan are back again as Roy O'Bannon and Chon Wang, this time traveling to London to avenge Chon's murdered father. Also Chon's sister, Lin (Fann Wong), is added to the mix as a potential romantic interest for Roy. While ""Knights"" isn't as good as the previous ""Noon"", it's entertaining enough and never seeks to be more then it is: A mindless action/ comedy. It's a lot better than Jackie's 'other' franchise sequel, Rush Hour 2"". Having enjoyed this film, it just makes my hopes for David Dobkin's next directed movie, ""the Wedding Crashers"".My Grade:B DVD Extras: Commentary with David Dobkin; Second Commentary with Alfred Gough and Miles Millar; Fight Manuel; Action Overload; 11deleted and extended scenes; Trailers for ""Bringing Down the House"", ""The Recruit""",Shanghai Knights
10,Aaron1375,Good follow up to Shanghai Noon.,8,17 February 2003,"Shanghai Noon was a pretty good flick and so is this one...it is a bit better than Noon.  Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan seem to have more chemistry this time and the humor is better.  The action is always solid, but it is mainly Chan doing all the fighting here with Wilson kinda just hanging back. The story is Chan's father is killed and the killers go to England and Chan, Wilson head to England to find the killers and get this royal crest back...also Chan has a sister to whom Wilson's character is attracted. Nothing ground breaking, but it is still a good buddy flick and worth checking out.",Shanghai Knights
11,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Shanghai Knights,7,11 January 2005,"OK, I'll mention not of the bland storyline, not of the kung-fu action (Jackie Chan seems to be a tad slower these days don't you think?), not of the infamous ooh-la-la licking scene where a sultry Fann licks Owen. This review will focus on the gags. Yup, you got me. The gags, without which, the film will never be the same: 1. The (mis)pronounciation of Chon Wang as John Wayne (ok, this is carried over from the first film) 2. How Roy creates Sherlock Holmes! 3. How the aspiring police inspector-writer happened to be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and how he got knighted! 4. How Roy unwittingly gave away his creation Sherlock Holmes to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (haha!) 5. Charlie Chaplin appears in the show! (yeah, he's the kid you see in the trailers!) Now you know where he got his inspiration from! 6. Wonder what happened to Jack the Ripper? Fann has the answer! 7. Automobiles are a weird invention, Roy? However, nothing much can be said of your investments in zeppelins :P 8. Moving pictures present a good investment opportunity And yes, stay on after the film ends. The outtakes, as usual, are always hilarious.",Shanghai Knights
12,SimonJack,Two sidekicks whose click is fast fading,4,18 May 2021,"Jackie Chan's character in this and his previous film with Owen Wilson, is named Chon Wang. Wilson's Ray O'Bannon pegged him in 2000 as a Chinese John Wayne. So when he calls his name in this film, it sounds very much like John Wayne. And, that remains the funniest thing in this second pairing of the two actors. Chan and Wilson play two sidekicks whose ""click"" is fast fading.This film has a little humor in the plot by introducing two characters of history from England. One could guess the first one right away. Tom Fisher plays a Scotland Yard inspector, Artie Doyle. That's Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the British author who created the character Sherlock Holmes who became England's most famous sleuth in a series of novels and short stories. In real life, Doyle was a medical doctor before his writing career - not a Scotland Yard detective. The second historical character is the young boy, Charlie, whom those who hadn't already guessed would be revealed in the end as Charles Chaplin. With the movie set in 1887, the real Charlie Chaplin of film fame wasn't yet born. A young Aaron Johnson plays Charlie.Those little fictional insertions of a couple of famous names are the extent of humor in this action comedy. And, as some others have noted, by this time in his career, Jackie Chan is no longer the karate or Kungfu master who is unrivaled. He has to be rescued a couple times by someone else. He gets captured a couple of times, and is injured three times and clearly beaten in his final martial arts contest with the villain, Lord Nelson Rathbone, played by Aidan Gillen.The screenplay for this film is a jumbled mess, with smaller plots in three locations tossed together. The script is full of holes, and it comes off as more hokey than any kind of action thriller. Chan was still making money on his films, but the declining net earnings was matching the declining quality of his movies.",Shanghai Knights
13,JamesHitchcock,Entertaining and Amusing Martial Arts Comedy,6,14 August 2006,"In ""Shanghai Noon"" Jackie Chan played a Chinese-born Western Sheriff named Chon Wang (pronounced, in one of the film's many in-jokes, ""John Wayne""). In this sequel the action moves from the Wild West to the London of 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Chon has gone to London, accompanied by his American sidekick Roy O'Bannon, to track down the men who have murdered his father, the Keeper of the Imperial Seal. The murderers are a rebel against the Chinese government and Lord Nelson Rathbone, a British aristocrat who is a cousin of Queen Victoria and tenth in line to the throne. Rathbone is planning to murder not only the Queen herself but also all the rest of the Royal Family so that he can become King. It falls to Chon, O'Bannon and Chon's sister Lin (with whom O'Bannon has fallen in love) to thwart this dastardly plot, assisted by a cheeky street-urchin (who later turns out to be Charlie Chaplin) and a bumbling policeman (who turns out to be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle).This is not, of course, a serious historical drama. There are numerous historical inaccuracies; apart from those already on your ""goofs"" board, I noted a couple more. There is no such place in Ireland as ""Holmes County"". Queen Victoria had nine children and, by 1887, numerous grandchildren, so any cousin of hers would have been a lot further down the line of succession than tenth. These goofs, however, do not matter greatly, as the film never sets out to be a serious drama or an accurate picture of late nineteenth century life. Like most Jackie Chan vehicles it is a comedy which incorporates martial-arts elements. (It has many similarities to the more recent ""Around the World in Eighty Days"" which presented an equally inaccurate picture of life in Victorian Britain).Much of the humour comes from the martial arts sequences, which, as normal with Chan, combine exciting action with slapstick comedy. Humour also arises from the relationship between Chon and O'Bannon, amusingly played by Chan and Owen Wilson. Many adventure stories have at their centre a European or European-descended hero accompanied by a loyal, but subordinate, non-Caucasian companion, a pattern going back at least to Robinson Crusoe and Man Friday and famously exemplified by the Lone Ranger and Tonto. In ""Shanghai Knights"" this pattern is inverted. O'Bannon has been publishing, under a pseudonym, a series of novels which give a fictionalised account of his adventures with Chon and which always show himself as the hero. In reality, however, it is the brave and resourceful Chon who takes the leading role; O'Bannon is lazy, boastful and something of a coward, a man who left to his own devices would prefer to lead an easy life and use his fame to attract the girls. He is, however, a loyal friend to Chon and can sometimes find reserves of courage when required. This may not be a serious film but it can be an entertaining and amusing one; I preferred it to the first film, ""Shanghai Noon"". 6/10",Shanghai Knights
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's funny because they make funny references to the future,4,21 November 2005,"In case you didn't know, I was being sarcastic! Man, this was a pretty bad sequel to ""Shanghai Noon"". I mean, it wasn't the acting or plot, I think it was the script. Also the character development? What character development? Owen Wilson just seemed so out of place in this film. You might as well have called it ""Shanghai Jackie"". I admit, Jackie has become a big star and deserves it, but now I think his ego is getting out of control. You can tell in the movie how much he is showing off his moves. We get it, Jackie can do karate well. It was cool in the past, but now, he's just getting old with it. I'm sure many are agreeing with me too. 6.3? Please? I really didn't get into it.4/10",Shanghai Knights
15,=G=,Equal sequel,7,16 July 2003,"""Shanghai Knights"", sequel to and by most accounts equal to ""Shanghai Noon"", sticks the same Chan and Wilson characters in another adventure which takes them to London where they become embroiled in convoluted intrigues neatly worked around everything from Big Ben to Charlie Chaplin to Jack the Ripper to Queen Victoria...etc. Fun stuff (maybe funnier, depending on taste) which features equal parts of Chan's inventive martial arts and stuntmanship and Wilson's poker faced off-the-wall comic relief, ""Shanghai Knights"" is an enjoyable three star comedy romp  and I could go for another helping. What's next? Shanghai Daze? (B)",Shanghai Knights
16,OllieSuave-007,When East meets West again...,7,18 March 2014,"The East meets the West again in this sequel, where British Parliament rebel Lord Rathbone (Aidan Gillen) murders Chon Wang's (Jackie Chan) estranged father (Kim Chan) and escapes to England with Wang's Imperial Seal. Chon teams up with Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and sister Chon Lin (Faye Wong) to avenge his father's death and to uncover a plot to murder the royal family.This is another good old fashion western comedy featuring Chan's signature martial arts moves and Wilson's mellow and grandiose personality. The two make a rock-em, sock-em team as they take out bad guy after bad guy, and, put in the martial-arts-skilled Faye Wong in the mix, you got triple the action and fun.Like the first film, the plot is quick-paced, helped by the story's many adventures, cultural references and fast action. More subplots and supporting characters were added to the story such as a young Charlie Chaplin (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), which served as a touching antagonist-turned-sidekick to our three heroes. The Sherlock Holmes and Jack the Ripper references served an interesting twist to the movie, as well as the appearance of Queen Victoria - all contributing to the grandiose and splendor of England back in that time. While I didn't care for Gillen as the lead villain, I enjoyed seeing Donnie Yen as the villainous Wu Chow more. His fight against Chan, pitting martial arts star against martial arts star, is a thrilling display of action cinema. The clash between the east and west cultures continue to be amusing and the slapstick humor and whimsical jokes from the cast made this a continuously entertaining feature.Grade B",Shanghai Knights
17,cherold,fun sequel,7,1 June 2004,"The implied promise of a sequel is that it will give you what you got from the first movie, but that promise is often broken.  Shanghai Knights is an exception, giving the audience that same mix of goofy dialogue and slapstick martial arts that made the first movie so much fun.  This time the duo heads to England, allowing them to make a bunch of incredibly silly jokes about England and Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chaplin.  The movie is essentially one long wink, and if you like that sort of humor your likely to find much of it amusing.  At times I thought they pushed the anachronistic dialogue a little too far, as when Owen asks the gorgeous Fann Wong if she works out, but overall it works pretty well.  Chan supplies a number of very entertaining fight sequences along with his usual goofy charm and the end result feels like a more actiony version of a Hope/Crosby road movie.",Shanghai Knights

19,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Even less fun than the original,2,21 June 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs When his father is murdered in the Imperial City, Chon (Jackie Chan) relocates his former partner Roy (Owen Wilson) from the first film and they set out to find the culprit. Their adventure reunites Chon with his long lost sister and takes them to London, unveiling a sinister plot involving the unscrupulous Lord Rathbone (Aidan Gillen) and his plot to over-throw the queen.This is another one of those films where I didn't find the original awfully enjoyable, so I didn't rush out to see the sequel. So, two years later, I've seen the sequel to Shanghai Noon- and once again, I needn't have bothered. At least twenty minutes too long, the uninteresting plot just meanders on and is rarely funny. Even Chan's amazing athletic abilities look bizarrely unimpressive and no fun to watch. In my eyes, this is just another Chan salvage job where only the out-takes give it any re-deeming credit. *",Shanghai Knights
20,g-bodyl,Worthy Sequel!,9,26 October 2010,"Shanghai Knights is a sequel that is just as good as the original. I'm glad they made another movie featuring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson together. They had just as good chemistry as they did in the original. Even thought this took place in London, I still loved it.Chon Wang, now a sheriff, finds out that this father was murdered. He goes to England with his faithful sidekick to avenge the death of his father.The acting here is very good. Owen Wilson was really funny and Jackie Chan has some good attempts at humor. Jackie Chan still can kick major butt though.Overall, I had a good time watching this film. Too bad they are not making a third film. I rate this film 9/10.",Shanghai Knights
21,CuriosityKilledShawn,Poor,4,11 May 2004,"Substituting the wide open spaces of the old west for the dingy, dirty streets of London is not fun. Roy O'Bannon and Chon Wang do not look like they belong there (and that's not meant to be part of the fun). The plot is the weakest, most uninspired and half-baked codswallop you can imagine, probably churned out in a few days, with a stereotyped villain so mass-produced and static that you'd be right in assuming the makers found him in a cereal box.Sometimes the writing is creative, such as the nods to Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chaplin, but Britain is represented in the most cliched 'Hollywood' way that it bogs everything else down.The escalating series of set-pieces may be imaginative but they sure do become very boring and repetitive. All they are really doing is filling the screen with movement, none of it being exciting or engaging (the same problem Matrix: Reloaded had) and when the movie is carried by these scenes alone, as the plot is not up to much, it almost completely fails.
The only saving grace is Owen Wilson who is far too talented and likeable to be wasting his time on this. He and Jackie made a sweet team in the first but this is not a good film for them.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1 sound. It contains dozens of deleted scenes, 2 commentaries (I find it hard to believe that there are 2 commentaries worth of things to be said about this) and an 'Action Overload' featurette.",Shanghai Knights

There are plenty of awesome fight scenes and wonderful stunts, and the opening is actually quite powerful, plus Fann Wong made a fantastic addition to this sequel in my opinion!. The ending is really funny, and all the characters are really likable, plus Aidan Gillen is very menacing as the main villain!. One of my favorite moments in this film is when Aaron Johnson(Charlie) steals Roy's(Owen Wilson) watch that his uncle stole!, as Owen chases the kid all over, and I thought this was very well made and written as well, plus there is one incredible stunt sequence involving Jackie and Owen on a clock tower!. It leaves the door open for another possible sequel, and the film has lots of great laughs in it as well, plus Donnie Yen was wicked in his role.

Overall a must see!. **** out of 5",Shanghai Knights
23,tabuno,An Uneven Action Movie with a Killer Ending and Improved Scenes,7,26 January 2019,"9 February 2003. Still not quite there, but the opening sequence is one of the most somber and killer sequences of any Jackie Chan movie and takes his movies into a more complicated realm of serious drama and comical humor. The fight scenes are original and fresh that capture the imagination and represent a significant improvement of the state of the art of Martial art fighting in the movies. The transition between serious drama and comedy is awkward, with even the humor a bit forced at times. But this is a fun movie with Jackie Chan keeping up improvements with each installment. There is a bit of serious talent, maturity starting to show through in this movie. As time goes on, it's possible that future movies will become out and out blockbuster hits if Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson can continue to develop their characters and relationships and get a good script that handles drama and humor as well as the best of comedy-dramas on television, one of the most difficult balancing acts in scriptwriting.",Shanghai Knights
24,The-Sarkologist,Nothing Like Chan's Originals,5,17 December 2020,"This is another one of those films that I'm not quite sure about. In fact, I'm not really all that sure as to how well it did. Basically it just seems to be an attempt to cash in on the Jackie Chan popularity, particularly from his days in Hong Kong cinema. However, the thing is that when he went to Hollywood, his films really just didn't seem to be the same. In fact, there is really nothing about this film that makes it stand out, other than it being a Jackie Chan film.So, the film starts of with Chon Wang (Chan) as the sheriff of the town that he had finished up in in the previous film, though we learn that the love of his life has left to go to San Francisco. However, he learns that his father has been murdered, and the imperial seal has been stolen, so he has to travel to London to deal with the problem. On the way he meets up with Roy to discover that the gold that he left with him is now all gone.Okay, it probably wasn't too bad, and it does have some charm about it, even though Owen Wilson really did annoy me. Then again, I suspect that the character is supposed to be annoying. The plot itself was fairly basic as well, and once again, it just seemed to be cobbled together to attempt to appeal to the Jackie Chan fans, and I have to admit that, well, while I saw it, and thought that it was entertaining, I simply didn't consider to to be anywhere near as good as some of his Hong Kong stuff.In the end, well, the jokes were too Hollywood, the style was too Hollywood, and it was, well, just fairly average as far as films go.",Shanghai Knights
25,slightlymad22,As enjoyable as the original,7,28 July 2014,"Like it's predecessor ""Shanghai Knights"" has a nice mix of action and humour, and in Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, two actors who clearly enjoy working together, and playing these characters. Like ""Shanghai Noon"" this movie bounds from one Chaplin-esque fight and gag to another.The Great Seal of China is stolen by sinister intruders, and its guardian killed. The guardian of course is the father of Chan, who is sheriff of Carson City, Nevada. Hearing of the tragedy from his beautiful sister Chon Lin (Fann Wong), Wang hurries to New York to join up with his old comrade in arms from the first movie Roy O'Bannon (Wilson).The movie is just the sort of mindless entertainment .For Jackie Chan, ""Shanghai Knights"" is a return to form after ""The Tuxedo"", whilst Wilson has been making a wide variety of roles Meet The Parents and Zoolander with Ben Stiller, Royal Tennebaums and Behind Enemy Lines with Gene Hackman and I Spy with Eddie Murphy.Among other reasons to enjoy this, is over the closing credits there are outtakes (Something Chan has done since his first American movie the Burt Reynolds led ensemble Cannonball Run) in which Chan and his co-stars miss cues, fall wrong, get banged and bounced on assorted body parts, and break up laughing. The outtakes are particularly good this time. I think every movie should have outtakes over the credits. Imagine Saving Private Ryan if it ended with outtakes......",Shanghai Knights

The direction was par excellence, the acting and sets, the story and props...everything was wonderful, exciting and exhilarating executed.You get to see Jackie, as only he can, pick up just any old thing and kick someone's butt with it. His choreography of these scenes was (as always) most excellent.While this installment was a bit subpar to the original, it was not the failure nor the flop other reviewers would have you think. It is great fun to see Chan and Wilson together again, this time in England. They are on an utmost mission: to save Chan's sister, who is attempting to locate their father's murderer, on her own. Having a penchant for attracting trouble, much like her brother in that aspect, of course she is the damsel in distress by the time they find her, but she soon shows she IS his sister, but demonstrating some very good foot and hand work.While it is not as rich in any area as the movie which this supplements, it is still a very entertaining endeavor and I hope they do more of this line together.This movie gets a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Shanghai Knights

One goofy and very funny moment after another is what we get. Jackie Chan and especially Owen Wilson have a certain quality perfect for a movie like this. Of course we also see some real Jackie Chan martial art scenes.The story is not something very important in a movie like this. Just see this for some good old fun, a lot of it, and try not to think too much. There are some nice scenes involving character names and historic persons like Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Doyle, Charlie Chaplin and Jack the Ripper. Highly enjoyable.",Shanghai Knights

This time around, our boys (Chan and Wilson) travel to turn-of-the-century London to tackle the killer of Chan's father. They get to ride in an automobile, even! The villain, Aiden Gillen, is smooth and effective. Chan's character has a pretty, ass-kicking kid sister in this one, played by Fann Won. Some funny name dropping comes up, including one surprise that is funny but highly improbable. It's just that the film lacks the pizazz of the first and lumbers along to an almost-identical finish to the original. This is a sequel that should not have been made. I knew we were in trouble from the opening, when I spotted a U.K. casting credit.",Shanghai Knights
31,DunnDeeDaGreat,Not as much fun as the first,5,13 February 2003,Shanghai Knights was a decent film but not as much as fun as the first.

The only thing that saved this from being a turkey was the fight scene between Yen and Chan. Make this one a rental.,Shanghai Knights
32,dglink,Hilarious Reteaming of Owen and Chan,9,19 January 2016,"Three years after teaming up in ""Shanghai Noon,"" Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson returned as Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon in the often hilarious sequel, ""Shanghai Knights."" Chon's father, keeper of an imperial seal, is murdered in China, and the seal stolen. Seeking revenge, Chon seeks out his old buddy, Roy, who has become a waiter and ladies' man in the American West. Roy has wisely invested his and Chon's money in Zeppelins, rather than dubious automobiles, which sends the penniless pair to London, where they uncover a plot to murder the Royal Family. Events unfold at a fast pace, each plot turn funnier and more implausible than the last. Owen taunts a stoic sentry outside Buckingham Palace, insults the British about their accent and loss of the American Colonies, is bewildered by spotted dick, and becomes the funniest Ugly American tourist in Victorian England.The physically adept Chan is often dazzling; his carefully choreographed martial-arts movements are almost balletic at times and recall Charlie Chaplin, who, played by Aaron Johnson, has a small but critical part in the film. But even beyond Chan, the film overflows with sight gags and slapstick; references to silent comedy emerge throughout, and a revolving fireplace and a wax museum recall Abbott and Costello routines. Chan and Wilson work together like a polished comedy team. Although Owen has most of the best lines and Chan most of the best action, Chan is more than a straight man and has some comedic moments of his own. While lovely Fann Wong as Cho's baby sister, not to be confused with baby sitter, and Tom Fisher as Artie Doyle, a would-be writer of detective novels, have their moments, the film belongs to Chan and Owen. The script by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who also wrote ""Shanghai Noon,"" is full of priceless lines, and the score by Randy Edelman incorporates several pop songs that provide amusing background to the frantic action. Director David Dobkin maintains a frenetic pace that will hold viewers' attention throughout the nearly two-hour running time. ""Shanghai Knights"" is that rare film that will leave viewers sorry to see end and wanting more.",Shanghai Knights
33,rebeljenn,mildly entertainly but poor film,2,9 April 2006,"'Shanghai Knights' stars Jackie Chan in an adventure that takes him to London with his American cowboy counterpart. This film combines action and adventure with comedy. Do not expect to see a great film, and don't take this film too seriously. In terms of an action and adventure film, the script is a little dull and the story moves slowly between imaginative sequences of action. The humour is not memorable, and it primarily consists of cultural jokes. This is not a memorable film, but it is okay if you want to sit and watch a fairly-entertaining-but-little-substance film for a couple of hours. A 2/10.",Shanghai Knights
34,EijnarAmadeus,Chan and Tucker bends into fabulous chemistry,7,26 June 2003,"SHANGHAI KNIGHTS (2003) the review might contain spoilers((( Buddy-action/comedies is a genre hitting the cinemas all over with big respect and blocks, I say: 48 hrs. Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour and many more off course, and off course Shanghai Noon there is. The sequel was released this year, and I really say; man! This is a really good movie!STORY: The story spins good. The Chinese Man (Chan o' course) are living a respectable and considering very nice life in the west in Carson City as a sheriff. Though his best buddy from the first movie Roy are living in New York, pretending and flirting with the ladies like he was a richman, and he is in the real world a waiter/""gigolo""! But in London, things have started happening. The thing is; Roy and China-guy has to work together and this time things really gets entertaining and slick: Roy invents Sherlock Holmes, they get to know Charlie Chaplin as a small-boy-pickpocket-thief, Chan's sister kicks Jack the Ripper's ass, they fight in Madame Tussaud's wax cabine, they fight in the top of Big Ben, Roy writes ego books about himself, Chan plays Singin' in the rain while fighting bad-guys and more - doesn't that sound cool then I really don't know! The film is like really much better then what I thought, it's better then the original both considered funny and thrilling. With great chemistry between actors Owen Wilson (who steals much of the show) and Jackie Chan it all runs very nice, and with dozens of other good supporting roles as Artie Doyle (Arthur Conan Doyle who later steals Roy's character in Holmes and decides writing books about him) and the main bad-guy who wants to be the King of England. Back to Wilson and Chan, this is good! We remember this folks from the start in film history, and there's always been actors coupling together good - like Gibson and Glover, like Robbins and Bridges...okay? As in the scene when Wilson says: ""I love you buddy!"" is worth a star more itself! The funniest scene of all is when Wilson, Chan and a bunch of women has pillow war and suddenly in all this slow-motion freak stuff this ugly and really out-of-order man ducks up and starts joggling together - we've never seen him before and we never see him again! Ha ha! Laughing out loud!It's crazy, it's funny! And Wilson, man! What a guy! Like when this Chaplin boy starts messing with him and Wilson answers: ""We've got parents! Who loves you!--"", delightful! Urge you to see it! STARS: **** 4/5 (ching-chang-oung! Get ready for kung-fu!)",Shanghai Knights
35,lawprof,Is Jackie Chan Heading for a Lifetime Achievement Oscar?,7,8 February 2003,"Well, a Lifetime Achievement Oscar may be the only category that's open to the aging but impish martial arts virtuoso, Jackie Chan, whose latest series-sequel, ""Shanghai Knights"" is...excellent, fun, entertaining.My kid got into Jackie Chan films a while back and we have a half-shelf of $5.99 videotapes of the young Chan.  Poorly shot with howlingly funny dubbing they nonetheless catch a Kung-Fu master at the height of his considerable prowess.Hollywood and Jackie's sincere but imperfect effort at learning English  led to a series of films that are high budget such as ""Rush Hour"" with its sequel and ""Shanghai Noon,"" now followed by this film.  Each has a sidekick for the irrepresible Chan but ""Shanghai Knights "" is the first where the faithful companion is a strong character in his own right.""Shanghai Knights"" begins with the Peking (not Beijing, it's the end of the nineteenth century) murder of Chan's dad and the theft of the Imperial Seal (a device to mark documents, not a pet).  Chan is a Nevada sheriff who upon learning of the homicide and theft sets off to New York City to find his pal, played formidably and with evident relish by Owen Wilson.The duo head for London where an unending series of misadventures brings the heroes, along with Chan's gorgeous and martial arts-skilled sister (Fann Wong) into the path of such diverse characters as little Charlie Chaplin, Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Jack the Ripper and others.  Of course all ends well and if the martial arts terpsichore is less breathtakingly complex than its predecessors - well, let's cut Jackie some slack.The film is PG-13 but Wilson provides a measured but running dose of raunch aided by a bevy of scantily clad beauties.  There's no doubt HE had a terrific time making the movie.Director David Dobkin keeps the pace moving and pays humorous tribute to films and stars from the Gilded Age of the cinema.  I won't spoil the amusing surprises but listen to the music as the intrepid trio (sister now a full-fledged partner) waft to and fro in a caricature of nineteenth century London.  Sad to say most moviegoers won't recognize the well-executed takeoffs of some great moments in film.As always, a special Chan treat are the outtakes before the end credits, scenes that prove making these films may not be good for the health of the no-longer-young star or his cast but they all have a blast (literally).And here's good news for the many who will enjoy this movie.  I don't know if there will be a ""Rush Hour III"" but last week I couldn't get within 150 feet of the venerable Yonah Schimmel's on the Lower East Side's Houston Street.  Chan and crew were filming a sequel to this new release - a flunky stopping pedestrian traffic told me the title would be ""Shanghai Knish!""  I can't wait.7/10.",Shanghai Knights
36,movieguy1021,Shanghai Knights: 7.5/10,7,25 January 2003,"Fresh out after his box-office bomb The Tuxedo, Jackie Chan is back, again playing the role of Chon Wang. In this sequel to Shanghai Noon, Wang and Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) are in different parts of the country: Chon in Nevada, Roy in New York. However, after Chon's father is killed by Lord Rathbone (Aidan Gillen), he must go to London to find Rathbone to avenge the death of the father. Along the way, Chon's sister Lin (Fann Wong) comes in. Guess who is smitten by her?Another reason why Chon has to kill Rathbone is that he has a sacred Seal of the Emperor. That's just thrown in to make the plot make more sense. Mucho fight scenes and hilarity ensues.Chan does better in buddy action comedies like this, instead of straight action. He's noted for using props around him in his fight scenes; this movie is no exception. Chan just takes any old prop he sees and does, what looks like, improv. It's hard to imagine all of these scenes choreographed perfectly; they seem so slipshod (in a good way). All of the fight scenes have Chan's usual charm and wit, you can't help but smile whenever he does seemingly impossible stunts.Many of the characters were one-dimensional. Rathbone doesn't really have any depth, except that everyone likes him. However, in movies like this, you don't really need twists and turns. Lin's beautiful, but what is her background? Someone working for Rathbone has no depth whatsoever and just pops in. And, of course, there's the little pickpocket (Aaron Johnson) whose name is quite funny. He just comes and goes.The opening credits were almost exactly like the ones for Shanghai Noon, with sweeps over Chinese letters. Something I enjoyed was how they incorporated famous figures, though a little bit goes a long way. About halfway through, it takes one of those obligatory buddy turns, where they end up hating each other. However, this time, the roles are reversed from Shanghai Noon and it lasts for about two minutes, which leaves you wondering why it was even put in. They took the cliché light-heartedly. At times, it did get heavy-handed (especially at the beginning), but managed to pull through.The sets were very authentic. Unlike the first, where they could just use cheap facades, they had to create a whole new world, and they did so. You could really believe that the clan was in England. I also liked the transitions in between scenes. They were all `swishes', but as the movie progressed and got more `complex', so did the transitions, from going out on both sides to diagonal. It may seem rather juvenile to put it in, and even more so to mention it, but I thought they were quite cool.I do wish, however, that they had spent more time in the West. If they had had more about the horse from the first one (also, whatever happened to Chon's wife, Falling Leaves?), it would have been better. However, it almost immediately left the West for the East. Like The Tuxedo, Chan allows himself to be pushed around and beaten.Chan is great, as usual. He's a great diversion from the real life. He can make us believe that what is done can be done. Technically, he can, because he does his own stunts. Wilson is in top comedic form here, as usual, also. He's quickly becoming an item in Hollywood, and his name's getting out there. Then again, he did do I Spy.I laughed a lot during Shanghai Knights. Many came from the fight scenes, and others were from Wilson's one-liners. I love how the writers can merge action and comedy seamlessly. I hope for a Shanghai Five, where they go to Hawaii, or some sequel, since this franchise is going somewhere.My rating: 7.5/10Rated PG-13 for action violence and sexual content.",Shanghai Knights
37,Mr_Sensitive,Shanghai Knights Summary,7,1 March 2005,"Follow the super hit of Shanghai Noon, come its sequence Shanghai Knight which is a surely no disappointment. Some people might also consider it to be better than the first.This time Chon and Roy traveled to England to get the revenge on Chon father murderer and to get the Emperor Imperial Seal back. Yep, just the storyline it sounds very good; and it did, from the start of the movie to the end there is something going on that won't bore you at all. And after watching a couple of time, I still find it to be a fast pace action pace film. Owen and Jackie are still great together. Better than expected. Overall, a very satisfying watches with some insightful of the history, like the character of Charlie Chaplin and Sherlock Holmes, how it comes alive.Reason To Watch: Ø Good Action Scenes, Ø Owen Always Great, Ø Fast PaceReason Not To: Ø Pretty Easy Ending,Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)",Shanghai Knights

It's difficult to say which I like better, although the two seem a little more at home in ""Noon.""  ""Knights"" is a movie not to be taken seriously.  The soundtrack attests to that, being mostly British invasion rock from the 1960's.  And there is a lot of historical fudging, not the least of which is Owen Wilson's dialogue and attitude.  He just seems so miscast as a cowboy.  What keeps this movie from going wrong is Jackie Chan's amazing moves.  Here he shows where he shines as an action-comedy star.  And the martial arts styles of Fann Wong and Donnie Yen are no slouch either!  So, never mind the anachronisms, just prepare to admire Jackie Chan.",Shanghai Knights

40,lagudafuad,just as nice as the first,6,31 March 2013,"Shanghai Noon (2000) gradually becomes Shanghai Knight, with both actors from the previous movie reprising their role as Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and Roy (Owen Wilson). The movie is not as good as the first, but it is surprisingly interesting funny and captivating. This time the makers also went as far as bringing into the plot this time much more familiar themes that we are more used too, we have in the plot this time a boy who winds up being Charlie Chaplin, the detective in the film ended up being Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who goes on to write the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and according to the movie the name Sherlock Holmes is a made up name by Roy.The movie plot is about our dynamic duo from the first movie, only this time their adventure takes them to England. The movie starts with the death of Wang's (Jackie) father who was a guard of the royal diamond seal which was stolen. Wang's father while dying told his daughter Chon Lin (Fann Wong) to retrieve the stolen seal and also deliver a puzzle box to her brother.Now Wang her brother had become a Sheriff in Nevada, and when he got the message about his father's death and the seal stolen away to England, he searched for Roy to get some money to travel to England. Roy on the other hand had lost all their gold that they got in the first film to gambling and daft investments. So now together with Wang's sister Lin, they have to retrieve the diamond and have it return back to china.Many more homages were made in this film that I will like to mention: 1. The name of the villain also was tagged ""the finest swordsman in England,"" which is a tribute to Basil Rathbone, who is known for his swordsmanship and always seem to be better than his counterparts in his movies but always holds back because the hero has to win. Also Rathbone played Sherlock Holmes in the 1930s to the 1940s series.2. Also in the movie we get to see Jackie Chan pay homage to the Rush Hour movie where Jackie distracts the guards by using Chinese vases.3. When knocking on Conan Doyle's door, the clothes that Roy and Wang are wearing are exactly the same dress that Holmes and Watson wore in Conan Doyle's stories.The movie did fairly in the box office but it was a massive hit in Pakistan, where the movie was dubbed in Punjabi and several millions copies of the movie's DVD and VCD sales were great, and so making the producers to also make Shanghai Noon also in Punjabi.This movie is a nice watch one that you will like seeing, and I enjoin you that you do.www.lagsreviews.com",Shanghai Knights

42,supertom-3,"Good sequel, good fun!!",6,23 July 2004,"This is another of Chan's best Hollywood efforts. The film is more frantic than the last one and has less subtlety particularly in the score. What it does have however is top quality action, the closest in recreating the high energy of Chan in Hong Kong. The comedy is superb once again, more over the top but still very funny with some great jokes referencing the period concerning the future, with Wilson's character remarking about what a bad idea the automobile is. Some of the action is fantastic it must be said. A disappointment is the showdown between Chan and another action legend from the orient, Donnie Yen who is sadly wasted to be honest. Their showdown is not nearly long or spectacular enough. Still a fun movie though. ***",Shanghai Knights

In fact, if you have the slightest dislike for Jackie Chan movies than this movie will definitely not turn your world around. Despite being extremely amusing and having some pretty sharp wit it never reaches the same intensity as its predecessor and in that regard it could be considered a weak sequel.On the other hand it has a genuine nice feeling that definitely makes it worth watching. The various anachronisms are all so very slight that they are unlikely to distract the viewer from the main plot.

This movie is good for many reasons like the fact that it holds up in storyline and does not add anything unnecessary and 2. it is a great performance by Jackie Chan. The movie is really funny and has awesome action scenes or sometimes Dance/Action scenes that rock.

Before she leaves, she sends a letter to her brother advising him of the wicked deed. Wang arrives in New York to claim the money still owed to him by Roy from the 1st movie, and together they set off for London to help Wang's sister and, perhaps, familiarise themselves with the ladies of Lahndon Tahn.It's neither riotously funny nor dreadfully dreary, coming across as more of the same in every regard.Jackie is watchable as ever, and even Wilson doesn't annoy too much and, for all its silliness, some of the action sequences are actually half decent.If you liked the first one, you will certainly enjoy this too.

47,AnishMisra,Shanghai Knights Review,8,6 April 2018,"Shanghai Knights is a film directed by David Dobkin. I had seen Shanghai Noon some months ago and was entertained by it. Due to some reasons, I couldn't see the 2nd part. But after seeing it yesterday night, I was overjoyed.Plot: Chon Wang and Roy go to London to seek vengeance for murdering Chon's father. Story and direction: These are the kind of films that I love. For the full 114 minutes, I was highly entertained by this film. Not a single moment felt dull. The comedy for me was spot on. The writers have so correctly written the story that it cashes on the star-power of our protagonists correctly Also the fight scenes were so nicely choreographed. It is always a treat to watch Jackie Chan fight. A big salute from my side to his stunt team for making me believe that good and realistic stunts are possible in cinema. The stunts also feel done in one-shot which I is a big thanks to the editing team. The sets and costumes were awesome and life-like. Also some popular references to pop-culture were appreciated. About some flaws with the film, I would say that if you are considering as something will be great about the film story-wise, don't. There is nothing much to the story. Also I did feel that there were some historical inaccuracies, that angered me a lot. Performances: Jackie Chan will always have a special place in my heart. In this film too, he shows that not only he is dedicated to his stunts but also delivers a good performance. Owen Wilson also performs good as a ""side-kick"". Fann Wong was a good addition to the cast. Donnie Yen and Aidan Gillen proved to be quite good villains. Tom Fisher too provided some great support.Favorite Scene: It is always a treat for me to watch Jackie Chan fight. So, for me the favorite scene of the film would be the London Market fight scene. The scene is choreographed so nicely. The comedy also was spot on and Jackie Chan makes the stunts feel so easy.Verdict: I had a great time watching this film. My tie was very nicely utilized. This film is highly recommended for those who want to have a fun time and also are ardent action lovers and Jackie Chan fans.I am going with an 8/10.",Shanghai Knights
48,AlabamaWorley1971,"""This country blows!"" But the movie doesn't.",7,10 February 2003,"Artistic? No. Great script? Uh-uh. Huge fun for young fans and old? Good Lord, yes! I love Jackie Chan movies because Jackie Chan loves making movies, and his energy and vigor are clearly up on the screen. I think Jackie & Owen work better than Jackie & Chris (although I think Chris Tucker's one of the funniest actors ever) because Jackie and Owen have a similar energy and laidback style. Fann Wong is gorgeous and I hope she works in American movies more often. Aidan Gillen is a super villain; all he needed was a mustache to twirl. Very cute movie! Something you can take your 10-year-old kid brother to without worrying. 7 out of 10.",Shanghai Knights
49,SinjinSB,Picks up right where the original left off,7,9 February 2003,"This sequel picks up right where the original left off and brings us more entertainment from Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. There's a nice blend of comedy and action. The two leads work well together and this time Jackie has a sister that is thrown into the mix. A pretty typical buddy film, without a plot that matters. Just showcasing the talents of the two leads...Jackie's kung fu and subtle humor and Owen Wilson's goofiness. You know what you're getting here and as always, don't leave before the credits are over as often some of the funniest moments are the outtakes.**1/2 (Out of 4)",Shanghai Knights

If you want to go and be entertained and laugh for a few hours and see one of the best film chemistry between two actors in film history, then you will enjoy this movie.  This is just a feel good comedy from start to finish. No more, no less.  It's not the best movie ever made, but for a few hours, it will make you feel good.  So don't go expecting too much, just go and have fun. I kind of wish they could make one of these movies every month.",Shanghai Knights
51,moviesfan11,incredible action and non-stop laughs! a great ride,10,23 July 2003,"Shanghai Knights, the sequal to the 2000 hit Shanghai Noon, is even better than the original. This was funnier, and there was more action then in the first. In the first, only Owen Wilson is funny in some parts, but in this one, Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, and other people, are also very funny. If you liked the original, then see this. If you hated the originl, you still might enjoy this. If you like Jackie Chan movies, then you will relish this Chan film.Final Grade for SHANGHAI KNIGHTS: A-PG-13 for action violence, mild language and some sexual content.

52,JimD73,Doesn't Survive Past Noon,3,17 May 2004,"Shanghai Knights (2003) Action/Comedy Reviewed 5/17/04 Starring Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Donnie Yen, Aiden Gillen, Fann Wong, Tom FisherPlot: 0/2: I really have no time for this, so I would like to thank Anonymous from the IMDb for this summary:In the 1880's, Chon Wang (Jackie Chan)'s father and keeper of the Imperial Seal has been murdered by Parliament and royal family member Rathbone (Aidan Gillen), (who steals the Imperial Seal) with Chon Wang's sister, Chon Lin (Fann Wong) witnessing the murder. Chon Lin follows Rathbone to London to kill him, while sending Chon a letter telling him of the murder. Chon then travels to New York for Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). Together they travel to England and meet up with Chon Lin to kill Rathbone and get the Imperial Seal back.Seriously, we already had Wang's uncle die in Noon, do we really need death in the family for the second again. Most of this is rehash and whatever isn't is bull beyond belief. One of the worst ideas ever was to put Arthur Conan Doyle as a main character. Jack the Ripper was an okay kind of comic bit, but don't mess with Sherlock.Action: 1/2: His name is Chan. He is the man. The action in this movie is okay, but ruined by the last scene. Seriously, this dumb guy Rathbone keeps giving back the dropped sword to Wang, and then he gets his ass thrown off Big Ben. Idiot, he deserved to die, but that was stupid.Comedy: 1.3/2: I would be lying if I said parts of the movie weren't funny. I would also be lying if I said any piece of this movie was hysterical. Some of the 'laughs' actually did there part to hurt the plot, such as the pillow fight. Christ.Acting: 1.5/2: Wilson and Chan have their roles down from Shanghai Noon, but everyone else is seemingly lacking something. Still, not terrible.Entertainment: 0/2: Really, this movie was so chock full of cheese, I can't see anyone having a very good time with this steaming turd.Bonuses -.3 for messing with Sherlock: see plot -.3 for the idiot Rathbone: see action -.3 for this: there is a romance between Chon Lin and Roy that is without a doubt the cheesiest romance ever. Not to mention they have zero chemistry.Total: 29%: Now this is a bad movie. It had a couple laughs and almost decent action, but is terribly cheesy. Avoid if you want to have a happier life.Also See: Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon",Shanghai Knights
53,mwendel,Funny & Entertaining (Possible Spoilers),6,12 May 2003,"Ok.  While the plot itself isn't bad, I found the story deployment weak at times.  There are a lot of humorous comments and jabs at the British history and culture throughout the movie, which are funny, but I think lack something in the delivery.  Maybe I'm just finding Owen Wilson's character a little too bland in his delivery and introspectiveness.  Either way, I think a lot of what was meant to be intelligent, dialogue-based humor just didn't quite hit the mark.The fight/action scenes really steal the show.  With Jackie Chan being known for great non-stop (and sometimes humorous) action sequences with no stunt double, he once again astounds with his evolutionary martial arts creativity.This movie contains several fantastic and original fight sequences with inspirations from the Keystone Cops, Abbott and Costello monster flicks and even Singing in the Rain (which is a particularly clever sequence that includes umbrella play).  Indirectly or possibly unintentionally he pays homage to some of the trendsetters and pioneers in the film industry.Jackie Chan pulls out the ladders, chairs, boxes, crates, hats, swords, coats and everything else hanging or lying around and once again displays his tireless efforts to make martial arts movies, in my opinion, more than just a male testosterone trip down action lane, but a genre with main stream audience appeal.In summary, this is an entertaining (although groan provoking) movie that's worth watching.",Shanghai Knights
54,Streetwolf,Slightly disappointed but the end credits were the best!,7,25 January 2003,"Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen I've waited to watch this movie for ages to see such brilliant martial artists in one movie.Summary: Chon Wang is now a sheriff in Nevada, but upon hearing news that his father has been killed and the royal seal has been stolen Chon heads to find Roy O' Bannon, but finds his friend in trouble after he has lost all the gold. They head to England to find Chon's sister Lin, who is in jail after trying to kill Rathbone, a member of the royal family, who killed Chon's father, whilst he was guarding the seal. After getting released from jail, Roy, Chon and Lin do their best to get the seal back before it lands in the wrong hands.Several famous names appear in the movie, Sherlock Holmes, Charlie Chaplin, but the funniest was Jack the Ripper. Jackie was excellent again and his fight scenes were a little bad timed, but still great to watch. I was extremely disappointed that Donnie Yen's character didn't have a BIG fight scene with Jackie and I do hope he has a bigger role in other movie projects that he has lined up (The one with Jet Li sounds interesting!) but it was a fun movie to watch, and the end credits, I've always been a fan of Jackie Chan's end credits, but this one broke the record of being the funniest. Owen Wilson's character Roy O'Bannon was weak in this movie. The first 15 minutes of him in the movie were dull and I'm still trying to figure out how he left the hotel, whilst Chon was in the doorway...how did he sneak by?I rate this movie a 7/10 and it's a must watch for all Jackie fans.",Shanghai Knights
55,TheBabblingFool,Definately Jackie's Best American Work,9,7 May 2003,"Shanghai Knights is a silly film, but then again most Jackie Chan films are. Just like Shanghai Noon used the old west, Shanghai Knights uses late 1800's London as the backdrop for some wackiness of historical proportions. It's not historically accurate, but who cares?Jackie and Owen are still a funny duo together, and have a great chemestry. I have to admit I found the first film funnier but there are times when they play off each other that are smile-enducing joy. I think the best addition to the cast is Fann Wong, playing Jackie's sister. She has to be one of the prettiest women I have ever laid my eyes on and her fighting is impressive.
Speaking of fighting, this is the highlight of the film. Jackie uses the historical backdrop to pay homage to films of the earlier era. Jackie fights cops in a routine similar to Keystone Cops. Another fight with Umbrellas is played as an omage to Singing in the Rain. And a sword fight between the main villain and Jackie seems to be a nod to practically every Zorro film ever made. All of these fights left me with a smile from ear to ear! These are hands-down the best fights Jackie has done since coming to the U.S.In the end Shanghai Knights is an excellent sequel, that full of wacky humor. I had a blast watching Jackie and Owen run around and cause chaos like 1800's London was a big Saturday morning cartoon show. Shanghai Knights oozes with infectious fun.",Shanghai Knights
56,JAKastner,Better days then 'Knights',7,8 February 2003,"Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson first teamed up in the modestly budgeted comedy, Shanghai Noon. The movie had a moderate $15 million opening weekend but went on to gross $56 million by the end of its domestic run in theaters. After a good following on home video, Touchstone Pictures has decided to increase the sequel's budget to $50 million and see if the magic can work better the second time around. Both stars need a big hit as The Tuxedo and I Spy failed to become big hits at the box office recently. But will the reteaming of Chan and Wilson bring in the big bucks or will other films outshine this comedy sequel?The story goes that the cowboy team of Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon are back together again on a special mission. They must travel to London after Chon learns that his father, who is keeper of the royal seal, is killed and the seal of the emperor has been stolen. They must travel even more quickly as they learn that Chon's sister has gone after the killer herself. Things become even more complicated as Roy falls head over heels for Chon's sister. Both Chon and Roy must join forces with some strange London characters in order to catch the killer. The story of Shanghai Knights is okay for a comedy of this kind but it does seem slow in many parts. Less talking and more action would have been better then what was given to the audience.The acting was what you would expect from a comedy of this kind, just okay. Jackie Chan has a field day with all the brand new action sequences he has in this film. His English makes it difficult for any scene in which he is speaking seems understandable but it works better then his earlier films. Owen Wilson does as good of a job as what is presented to him. He can't do more then what is presented in the script and that is what the audience expects. The performances by the other characters were moderate at best. There were not many who stood out within the film because their acting was what the audience expected.Overall, Shanghai Knights is another good time at the movies during the slow season at the box office. The main thing that this film suffers from is predictability. The film performs at every level it is expected to and doesn't surprise the audience by doing something that had not been done in the first film or in other films of this kind of genre. The action sequences were the best that have ever been performed in a Jackie Chan film. Jackie Chan really out does himself in Shanghai Knights. The story, outside of predictability, suffers in that it slows down a lot in certain parts of the film before picking up again with an action sequence or two. Shanghai Knights is just another good popcorn films to catch during the slow season at the box office, so catch the film if you have the time during the weekend. If not, there is always Daredevil coming out Valentine's Day weekend.My Rating: ***1/2 out of 5",Shanghai Knights
57,vvanpo,The chemistry is still there,6,18 February 2003,"Jackie and Owen continue the chemistry they showed in Shanghai Noon.  They look like they have fun working together.  The movie is fun too, not to take too seriously.  One thing you must not take seriously is its timeframe. The storyline involves Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee.  I looked it up.  That's 1887.  So I played a game of what doesn't belong like automobiles and paperback novels - and Chinese sheriffs.  But like I say it's all fun.  Even Charlie Chaplin and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle get in the act.",Shanghai Knights
58,baumhenrik,Fun for the whole family,7,29 September 2019,This movie is a perfect example that movies don't need to be perfect and demanding to be entertaining and give you a good time. The jokes are funny the actors fit their roles the setting is interesting and the action sequences give it that special something. Especially the umbrella fight scene is burned in my head since I first saw it. Jackie Chan is just a stunt choreography genius.,Shanghai Knights
59,chuckrules,Great Chemistry,7,20 May 2003,"Realistically we can skim right over the plot in just a sentence or two.Jackie's character reunites with Owen Wilson's character to track the murderer of Jackie's father to England, meet up with Jackie's sister, and save the royal jewels of China. Pretty simple.What saves this movie is the interaction between Chon Wang (Jackie) and Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). The two are hilarious together. Where the Chris Tucker/Jackie Chan collaboration lags is that it seems Chris is trying to be the focus of the entire movie and steal every scene. Owen Wilson with his laid back style seems to be playing off of Jackie and enjoys being the second fiddle who ultimately gets the most attention because of that. The dialogue that he fires off is just wonderful and crisp. After reading the interview/profile on Owen Wilson in Premiere I would love to see where he finessed and changed the dialogue.Also the physical scenes with Jackie stand out in this film. I read once that he choreographs his fights as if they were a dance and that is never more apparent than in the homage to ""Singing in the Rain"". I think Gene Kelly would have greatly appreciated this interesting take on his famous dance. Sad to say but I believe I was the only one in the theater laughing at that point",Shanghai Knights
60,ToddTee,"People who comment about ""factual errors"" in a fictional comedy",8,29 July 2009,"Far too many people seem concerned that the author of a comedy set in the late 19th century - or any time, in fact - doesn't adhere to facts. Isn't that why it's fictional? Give us a break and stop reporting that the type of button on Joe Blow's shirt wasn't used until 1892 and this movie is ""set"" in 1878 and so the button can't be used. Try enjoying it as a comedy and not worry about this meaningless ""stuff"". Nobody but you cares about such minutia. The rest of the world is too busy laughing to care if Charlie Chaplin was really alive at the time of the movie, or the movie industry existed or Arthur Conan Doyle was ever a police detective for Scotland Yard. The movie was a blast, and these deviations from history are part of what made it so.",Shanghai Knights
61,joshfedderson,"The Unlikely duo of best friends join up once again, this time in Great Britain!",9,29 May 2018,"Shanghai Knights brings back the fun duo of Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson and this time they travel to London to seek vengeance on the murder of Chon's father and to rescue Chon's sister Chon Lin. The two friends find themselves in great Britain, and it's a whole different world then the old west, things are more proper but also more fun. The duo make new adventures with a British twist and Roy falls for Chon's sister who actually has a thing for him too. Eventually the two foil a plan made by an evil British higher up and save the united kingdom and the Royal family.This second installment was good and I enjoyed the story I also enjoyed how Chon's younger sister was in it along with her own Ninja moves. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the fact that it didn't have a lot of fighting action in this one then the first, I'm not saying it was bad, but it didn't have that much Chan action therefore I give it a 9. But it makes for a great sequel, and if they do make a third one, I hope it will be good too. 9/10 for Shanghai Knights",Shanghai Knights
62,drunken_critic,Jackie is great at stunts,7,21 November 2003,"I have come to the conclusion: I only go to Jackie Chan movies to see spectacular stunts and cool fight scenes.  This movie was like a dance movie for guys.  The fight scenes are more than punching and kicking.  The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed dances.  The fight scene in England with the gang that harassed the kid thief is a perfect example.  It was homage to the movie `Dancing in the Rain' when Jackie Chan (character John Wayne) fought gracefully with an umbrella.I wish there were more fight scenes and stunts in this movie.  I felt the story was boring and formulaic and the only thing redeeming was the fights/stunts.  The script was corny.  Every person involved referred to/or was a famous person in history.  This movie was the sequel to Shanghai Noon. It was mildly funny in the first movie when Jackie Chan's character was named John Wayne, but this movie it was done overboard.  The kid thief ends up being Charlie Chan.  The detective at Scotland Yard is the writer of Sherlock Holmes.  Jack the Ripper even makes a lame cameo in this movie. It felt very lame and almost painful watching some parts.  For instance in the end they are knighted by the Queen, Chan and Wilson bow in humility made me sick at the cheesiness of the situation.  I squinted my eyes and grimaced during most of the attempt to make an original story, but I came alive during the action sequences of the movie.Hopefully in Chan's next movie, there will be more stunts and fight scenes and less dialogue. 6.5/10",Shanghai Knights
63,DD-931,Anachronism as Comedy,7,27 April 2003,"I'd just like to point out to all the people who are complaining about the goofs in SHANGHAI KNIGHTS that the anachronisms ARE PART OF THE HUMOR OF THE MOVIE!  Good Lord, folks, most everything Owen Wilson's character says is anachronistic ON PURPOSE!  It's a comedy!  Lord Rathbone?  ""Artie"" Conan Doyle?  Charlie Chaplin as the Artful Dodger?  I laughed harder at this movie than I have at any movie in the past year.  It's sad to me that more people can't enjoy this movie as the delightful GOOF that it was meant to be.  When Owen Wilson said ""...Vera, Chuck, and Dave..."", I had a great laugh...and sadly, was almost the only one in the theatre who got the joke. There are even Pythonesque moments in this film if you're open to watching for it.  Anyone who thinks this is presented as an accurate representation of England probably would argue about the scientific implausibilities of the Teletubbies.",Shanghai Knights
64,CMUltra,"Matches the enjoyment of the first, which is good!",7,20 July 2003,"*Minor Spoilers!*Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson reprise their characters of Wang and O'Bannon in this second installment of the series.  I hope there will be a third!Chan's slapstick fight sequences are even better here than in Shanghai Noon. They're bigger, better and there are more of them!  In addition to all of the clever integration of set items (fruit stands, wax sculptures, books, ladders, etc) that we are accustomed to, the Shanghai Knights sequences are also imbued with a wonderful sense of meta-humor.  While he's using an umbrella in his kung fu against the Fleet Street gang, there is a sudden brief and whimsical nod to Singin In The Rain, complete with flawless stylisms by Chan.I believe the use of actual characters from the period was a bit overdone. At times they were cute winks to the audience while, at other times, they seemed needlessly inserted.  Distracting. One very nice addition was Jack the Ripper, if only because of the brief and very decisive meeting he has with Wang's sister, Lin.  Lin is played by Fann Wong and, as the female interest, is superior to Lucy Liu's character of the first movie.The villains are better too.  Aiden Gillen is good as Lord Rathbone, then fantastic in his action scenes.  The best, however, is Donnie Yen.  Yen's portrayal of the evil Wu Chow is okay, but who really cares?  The character itself is merely the vehicle to get Yen and his fantastic martial arts skill into a movie with Jackie Chan.  Seeing these two work together in beautifully choreographed fights was a dream come true.  And though partially edited out of the actual movie, the DVD thankfully offers their climactic fight scene in its full-uncut glory.My only disappointment of note was Wilson's O'Bannon character.  He wasn't quite as consistently funny in this outing, and the character itself could have been portrayed better.  There was no evolution in O'Bannon.  He had the exact same deficiencies as in the first movie.  I understand that the charm of O'Bannon lies in his irresponsibility, but a *little* maturing could have been accomplished while keeping the charm intact.  Evolution is important to keeping the characters fresh, but O'Bannon was the same as in the first.Overall, I rank this a little better than the first and HIGHLY recommend it!6.5 out of 10.",Shanghai Knights
65,jwpappas,The worst Jackie Chan film of all time,1,14 July 2003,"SHANGHAI KNIGHTS is easily the worst Jackie Chan film that I've ever seen & I am a guy who sat through HALF A LOAF OF KUNG FU. The chemistry between Chan & Owen Wilson is non existant as they seem to be reading their dialogue off of billboards a mile away. The jokes are lame, the fight sequences are faked & unconvincing & its obvious that Jackie is just too old to chop the suey anymore. What is the point of a jackie Chan film when it isn't Jackie doing the fighting or stunts? If you want to have fun with a Jackie Chan flick check out any of his HK flicks from 1989 to 1998 (ie PROJECT A, SUPERCOP, DRUNKEN MASTER 1 & 2, FIRST STRIKE, MR NICE GUY), but avoid his US stinkers like the SHANGHAI & RUSH HOUR flicks & THE TUXEDO.

69,thirdi,"Entertaining & funny, a good sequel",10,15 December 2003,"I'm scratching my head trying to figure out the negative comments regarding this movie. Some people take stuff way too seriously I guess. Shanghai Knights is a hilarious and entertaining movie that is pretty much perfect for anyone who is looking to sit back and take a fun ride. After all, isn't that what a movie should be?  Or at least when you're in the mood for it?I'm not looking for historical accuracies or poignant subplots when I rent a movie like this, I just want to escape my boring life for a couple of hours. And this film delivers. Owen Wilson is outrageous as he wisecracks his way in and out of side-splitting situations and tight spots.  And he and Jackie Chan play perfectly off each other. As in the first movie, the comedy is nicely fitted between superb action scenes and a decent enough story. But let there be no doubt, these are comedies, and they are among the best in the last few years.  I'd have to say Shanghai Knights is a bit better than the first one, through and through, but you really can't enjoy it without having seen Shanghai Noon.As far as the action, I think many take it for granted, but all the fight scenes, Jackie Chan's work especially, are like poetry on film. There must be an enormous amount of time spent on planning this stuff, and its amazing to watch.

Loved the performance by Jackie his stunts , sense of humor , action and also the performance by Owen which I didn't expect to be better than the Shanghai Noon but it was even better and the moment when Jackie finds out he's not rich and he's a waiter .

The fighting is great, and the sets look expensive and lavish.  But the writing is mundane and not that funny. Fann Wong, who played his sister, was wonderful, but I thought Owen Wilson was just darned annoying; I would have enjoyed it more without him.I dunno, this movie seems to be a hit at the Cineplex, but gee Jackie, aim higher next time.",Shanghai Knights
72,Squirelly Joe,"Extremely Good, Especially Seeing as how it's a Sequel",9,8 February 2003,"The great thing about Shanghai Knights is that it doesn't follow the bomb-drop pattern that many sequels do. Every character in this movie that was in Shanghai Noon has the same actor. Even the same horse plays Fido! Sadly, the princess is absent from the film, as well as Chon's native wife. But it still stays true to the original in terms of character traits. Chon is still a bit stuck up and Roy is still reckless and witty. The plot revolves around a precious gem stolen by a high-class Britain who kills a certain someone in the beginning of the movie. A bonus of the movie is Chon's sister that, in a way, makes the movie fresh in terms of action scenes. The character jokes I found particulatly funny, which ties into the name jokes like in Shanghai Noon (Chon Wang being sounding like John Wayne and Roy's real name being Whyat Erp). The final action scene was extremely well done and as in all Jackie Chan movies, the bloopers in the end provide a good comical ending to the movie.",Shanghai Knights
73,hoopoe,It is great to get so many belly laughs!,8,7 February 2003,"Thank you, Jackie and Owen, for making me laugh out loud.  The Gene Kelly bit was a masterpiece with the umbrella and the background of ""Singing in the Rain"".

74,perla_arabia,Fantastical,8,25 February 2007,"Fantastic in the full meaning of the word. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson have such natural chemistry, you feel as if they could be you and your buddy. I have been a Jackie Chan fan for 15 years now, but since he started making Hollywood movies i haven't been following up much on his movies. His talent is amazing but he no longer wins duels, or saves the day, or is the hardest fighter among all. He is constantly being saved by a side kick or the female lead, which is rather disappointing for me. I don't mind it much, it sends good messages to the youth about martial arts being for defense not inflict harm, as well as the meaning of being a team. But come on its Mr. Chan the guy can do sooo much, i would love to see him in a good role, along with Owen again or other stars if Hollywood thinks Jackie on his own won't sell. This movie was a fantastic journey that exploited every aspect of the English :D making sure not to miss any chance of recycling names and historical events. It was hilarious and really fun to watch, a good follow up to Noon.",Shanghai Knights

First of all it is a comedy, second it is Hong Kong style action with a twist....  third (and this is the most important) its a SEQUEL.  If you didnt love 'Noon', dont see this one.
I loved the campiness, and the humor of this film.  It is rife with historical blunders...  cars, charlie chaplin....  etc,  but because Jackie and Owen do thier jobs,  I didn't care...  I was just waiting to see the next bit of action or witty word play.The action is difinately from an older Jackie Chan, but is more artistically plotted. Owen Wilson, had better lines in the first movie, but carries through on RoyO'Bannon's roguish charm.See this movie f you like the first one....  chances are you wont dislike this one.",Shanghai Knights

I didn't expect much from this film but boy...it does entertain me. Owen Wilson and Jackie are perfect together. Both are funny especially Owen Wilson. The story basically is about Jackie and Wilson going to London to avenge for Jackie's father. Highly recommended for Jackie's fans. Better than SHanghai Noon !!Ratings : 8 out of 10,Shanghai Knights

It has so much good humor and many, many references to other classics that just make one pay attention, much as one has to do with The Princess Bride.Many hilarious moments and Chon's sister kicking the Ripper's butt is one of my personal favorites.Worth buying.I very much wish Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson kept making this series.",Shanghai Knights
80,potidaean,Rolling-in-the-aisles Hilarious,10,17 February 2003,"Better than Noon, this movie has tons of inspired jokes that come out of nowhere. Owen Wilson has the best lines in the movie, and Jackie Chan can still kick ass and look great, even if he's not as acrobatic as he was 20 years ago. The final fight was disappointing, but everything else makes up for it.Best of all, no more Lucy Liu. Fanny Wong is so much better (and hotter), though they should have given her better fights. She always seems to need to be rescued. Also, the little kid wasn't as annoying as he could have been, so that's a big plus in any movie. In all, a great movie that I'll be watching again and again (like the first). Yeah, there are a lot of stupid parts, but if you let your brain coast on neutral, this movie is packed with entertainment of all sorts.",Shanghai Knights

Seen it as a kid, watched it again, this time understanding all the cultural references which made it even more enjoyable. Charlie Chaplin, Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle, etc. Flaws, of course there were (machine gun hitting absolutely nobody, okay, maybe just 1 person). Same as the first, I didn't enjoy the stereotypes. Sure it makes it fun sometimes, but I'm just tired of them. Definitely enjoyed the ""Singin in the Rain"" fight scene, one of my Jackie favorites of all time. I wonder where they'll go next (sequel pending).",Shanghai Knights

That was so funny. Overall 7 out of 10.,Shanghai Knights
83,isabelbutic,Funny as hell,9,23 February 2004,"After noticing that the movie starts off with Jackie Chan as a wild west sheriff back in the 1800's, there's no use in pointing out that this movie is dumb. I'm assuming people reading this have seen the movie, so I won't do to much summarizing. Besides, IMDb includes a synopsis for that reason.To begin, I noticed that a lot of people who didn't like this film were not from the U.S. Perhaps slapstick American humor just doesn't do well abroad? shrug. Many thought that the historical fudges were supposed to be taken seriously. But because this is an action-comedy cut it some slack! They're just trying to make you laugh! Others wanted this to be a serious martial arts flick and probably thought it was too cutesy. How are people supposed to laugh if there's blood and guts? I don't think Drunken Master approach to the ""fight scenes"" would work in this film.The fight scenes were brilliantly choreographed. I don't have that much blood lust and would much rather watch Jackie cleverly manipulate ordinary objects into nonlethal weapons. In the special features, Jackie said if it was just fighting, then not only would it be violent the scenes would get boring. I can relate to that- after 400th fight scene in Crouching Tiger I was pretty much bored of them.I thought that the sequel was hella better than Shanghai Noon. Lucy Liu trying to sound like an aristocratic Chinese woman was grating on my nerves. There were just way too many cheesy moments in the last film. Not that the sequel was cheese free, but they cut down on it at least. All the relationships between the characters were believable and enjoyable to watch. I wish they had a little more of the Artful Dodger causing trouble and mouthing off- but I guess O'bannon did enough of that for both of them. And the scene where Chun tells his sister why O'bannon would make a lousy boyfriend was too funny.",Shanghai Knights
84,Citymars,Shanghai Nyets,3,10 July 2003,"Another sequel in a long history of film sequels (e.g., Beverly Hills Cop 2, Legally Blonde 2) that borrow the main ingredients but miss whatever elusive quality made the original enjoyable in the first place.  ""Shanghai Noon"" was unexpectedly charming fluff, but this follow-up weighs a ton.  Even the leading actors seem to feel it.  Did the three-year interim between films really age them?  Jackie Chan is less spry than ever before, and Owen Wilson's anachronistic delivery lacks the sparkle that made it funny the first time around.  A seriously misguided effort was made to enliven the proceedings with a silly and obvious music score.  One can only hope that whoever was responsible for the music has been punished along with the writers and director.",Shanghai Knights

Some of the jokes where very good and well timed and the ""singin' in the rain"" tribute was excellent in its construction and flawlessly executed.  There was not much substance in this adventure however and nothing new was learned about our ""heros"".  The creation of a sister was a good touch, making her more than capable of taking care of herself was also nice.  Not showing her using her brain much, was sad: making her the damsel in distress was depressing.  I will not waste your time any more than to say that if  you like pure action flicks, or are a huge Chan fan than it will be a fun ride, but nothing more.  Worth a watch on DVD.",Shanghai Knights
86,puckbond007,"Shanghai Knights-7/10 is a wildly entertaining, fun, action-packed movie...",7,14 March 2003,"Possible SpoilersShanghai Knights is a wildly entertaining, fun, action-packed movie filled with funny one-liners, wonderful fight scenes, daring escapes and adds a few nice touches to boot. A sequel to the enjoyable 2000 movie Shanghai Noon that teamed up Jackie Chan as devoted Chinese Imperial guard Chon Wang(John Wayne a terrible cowboy name) and Owen Wilson as wise-cracking gunslinger Roy O'Bannon. In movies like this the plot has become irrelevant but the two stars make for two loveable rogues and the action and funness make the movies enjoyable...and this sequel was slightly better I would say. This time around a royal heir to the throne(20th in line...nope make that 10th) Rathbone played by Aiden Gillen has murdered Wang's estranged father and keeper of the Imperial seal...and is plotting to eliminate the royal family along with a Chinese traitor who also has aspirations to rule. This time we get Chon Wang's sister Chon Lin played by Fann Wong(who also gets to do some ass-kicking and plays Roy's love interest) and she follows the murderer to London as do Chan and Wilson. The film is peppered with jokes about English weather and food etc. and we are treated to all of London's landmarks like Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, The Tower of London and Madame Tusauds Wax Museum but once again we are treated to Jackie Chan's unparalleled imaginitive style of fighting using all kinds of objects and structures as both weapons and defense. I especially loved the Singin' in the Rain umbrella fight scene. As I said earlier this movie also has some nice touches with its historical cameos of sort. Although exact periods of time are slightly off that is easily forgiven. I loved the numerous references to Jack the Ripper(the serial killer who murdered several prostitutes in the White Chapel district and was never found...its hilarious to think maybe some little Chinese chic just kicked his ass off a bridge and he drowned). Also Tom Fisher is delightful as tender Scotland Yard detective/writer Artie Doyle(Arthur Conan Doyle creator of Sherlock Holmes). We are also treated to a cute little thief who would become known as Charlie Chaplin. Funny since Chan has sometimes been called a modern day action version of Chaplin. Wonderful historical cameos like that really added to the sense of fun this movie has. Overall, Shanghai Knights is a very enjoyble sequel starring the amazing fighting talents of Jackie Chan and the fun antics of Owen Wilson. Forget the plot and just enjoy the action, the humor and the fun of it all.",Shanghai Knights

88,natport19,funny and frequently witty...,6,14 March 2003,"As good as you may believe Jackie Chan to be, it is his chemistry with Owen Wilson that makes Shanghai Knights a success.  The action sequences are at the head of its class for the genre, but it is the humor and frequent wit that connects all of the dots.  Without spoiling all of the details, Shanghai uses its fictitious storyline to humorously incorporate historical figures into its plot, such as Jack the Ripper, Charlie Chaplin, and Arthur Conan Doyle.  Never stretching its PG-13 rating, the movie remains funny even with its light ethnic jabs and sexual material.Chan and Wilson also starred together in the original installment to this hopeful growing franchise.  Also, they have both proved their recuperation after horrid efforts in The Tuxedo and I-Spy, respectively, in the second half of last year.  Now that Wilson has a few of these buddy comedies under his belt, it might be best for him to return to his greatest talent: writing.  Nominated for Best Original Screenplay at last year's Academy Awards was The Royal Tenenbaums, which he co-scripted with director Wes Andersen, but it was their screenplay for Rushmore, along with flawless performances by Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, that is by far the better of the two.But for Shanghai Knights, which is consistently funny, the humor extends into a series of hilarious outtakes proving Chan's lack of knowledge in the English language.  The best of which is when he means to say `baby sister' and results in saying `babysitter.'  Wilson is quick to poke fun at him, showing that their great chemistry so apparent on-screen is also a backstage thing too.  So, if you are sick of the over-rated Academy Award nominated films, then two hours with these guys will do you no harm, and you will laugh just as hard as you would at any other 2003 comedy (yes, including Old School and Bringing Down the House).*** out of ****",Shanghai Knights

He was actually an actor from the age of five and did not get to America until he was 21 in 1910.The year is 1888, and Jack the Ripper is wandering the streets of East London, hunting down prostitutes(and Xion Lin for some reason)to mutilate.The year is 1862 and Richard Gatling has just invented the Gatling Gun of which of which the Chinese assassins have a prototype.Aside from the immense historical inaccuracies, Jackie Chan is incredible, the gags are brilliant, the Singing in the Rain fight sequence will make you say ooh and ow, Owen Wilson makes the most evil insult to orphans everywhere. I recommend seeing it but don't use it as a historical guide for anything.You will like it and your kids WILL love it.",Shanghai Knights
90,cvw,If you liked the first...,8,21 January 2003,"A few minor spoilers follow.The thing with movies like SHANGHAI NOON is that they're difficult to critique.  Really, there's only one question you can ask: is it a good one?Yup.  Even though many of the bits are recycled, even though it has its share of rough patches, even though the producers inexplicably decided to include a Short Round-esque kid into the equation (well, he's more of an Artful Dodger, really,) it all tips over to the plus side.  If you liked the first one, you'll like this one.The plot is.what the Hell do you care what the plot is?  Jackie and Owen kick ass in England (mostly Jackie, natch.)  End plot summary.Jackie's fight scenes are some of the best he's had in YEARS.  You can't explain a Jackie Chan fight sequence, you just have to watch it, and here they're every bit as energetic, ridiculous, and slapstick as any of his past glories.  They do, however, have the added dimension of someone (whether it was the producers or Jackie, I don't know) deciding to just pull out all the stops and go ahead and let Jackie be Buster Keaton.  There's a silent film feel to many of the kinetic sequences here (none more so than a Keystone Cops-esque fight with a handful of cops and a revolving door.)  I can't honestly think of a more seamless blend of Jackie style stunts and silent era slapstick (check the fight scene in the marketplace for reference: straight outta Keaton.)  A blatant reference to Harold Lloyd in the Big Ben sequence at the end doesn't hurt, either.Owen Wilson still plays Owen Wilson, just snottier.  There's an speech he gives a street urchin that borders on the outright cruel, but it works just because Wilson's such a willing doofus.  The bad guy, played by Adian Gillen, looks like the bastard child of Alec Baldwin and Gary Oldman, and he plays it with the appropriate moustache-twirling menace.  The film gleefully ignores feasibility, or even historical accuracy, although it dips into history more than a few times.Flaws?  Yes.  Many glaring.  Why, why, why do filmmakers feel the need to insert a wisecracking kid into a perfectly good buddy film?  And for God sakes, I know we're in England, but did the wisecracking kid have to be a cockney street urchin by the name of Charles Chaplin?  (And yes, that means exactly what you think it does, right down to the kid sporting a little fake moustache.)  The music is jarring and obvious, and underscores with gigantic capital letters what everyone with a pulse was picking up on anyway. There's a pillow fight in the middle that's just wrong.  I can't break it down, but it just plain feels wrong.  It's also too long, but that's neither here nor there.Many of the geek persuasion will undoubtedly pick up on the fact that many of these stunts have been done before, as well (they even use the revolving fireplace gimmick from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.or was it THE LAST CRUSADE?) But like those same three chords that bands have been using for about half a century, they still work: if the repetition bugs you, you're thinking too much.  That said, some of the repeats are in the bloopers (some of which simply HAVE to be staged.)  Remember Chris Tucker's cell phone going off in the RUSH HOUR II outtakes?  It's Jackie's turn this time.  Remember how Chris Tucker called him Jackie in one flubbed scene?  Now Owen Wilson gives it a shot.  Certainly, these kinds of things must happen in the process of making the film, but do you have to stick 'em in the blooper reel AGAIN?None of this drags too much, however, and frankly, if you're not willing to get in the spirit of the proceedings, you shouldn't have bothered seeing the film in the first place.  SHANGHAI NOON ain't gonna redefine cinema, but it's a good one of its kind.",Shanghai Knights

Chon Lin (Fann Wong) sees her father, the keeper of the seal, killed. With his dying breath, he gives Lin a puzzle box containing a message for her brother Chon Wang (Jackie Chan). When word reaches him in Carson City, NV, he ditches his job as sheriff and goes to New York to enlist the help of his friend Roy (Owen Wilson)-whose personal integrity and a dollar wouldn't get you a cup of coffee even back in 1887. Chon's sure he's settled down and is no longer a womanizer. Yeah right.Chon and Roy go to not-so-merry old England to join forces with Lin, who has followed the killer there-Wu Yip (Donnie Yen). His benefactor is Lord Rathbone (Aidan Gillen); it's a you scratch my ruler ambitions and I'll scratch yours kind of thing. Our trio is assisted by Scotland Yard detective (Tom Fisher) and a street urchin named Charlie Chaplin (Aaron Johnson).The basic premise here is solid, but the plot elements oscillate between overbearing, predictable and incredulous. Also, the numerous historical references come across as gratuitous and the '60s music on the soundtrack is (duh) out of place. Did I mention the continuity faux pas involving the brandy carafe?That said, the action sequences are up to Chan's usual standards and the romantic angle between Lin and Roy is handled quite well.  While Chan's and Wilson's performances are decent, Wong's dynamic onscreen persona steals the show. Despite its flaws, this one is worth a look.

Wilson's comedy is a bit overstated, and the ""famous person rolled into the plot"" schtick becomes old quickly.Still, it is fun at moments.

The plot is disposable, but Jackie Chan is in rare form, and the creativity of his physical gags seems particularly developed this time out. Owen Wilson is equally enjoyable although he's basically doing nothing except giving off a tremendous raffish charm and good humor.  The fact is, everything he says in this movie is funny.  Some of it is laugh out loud, some just makes you smile.  But this is one of the best times I've had at the movies in quite a while.",Shanghai Knights
95,TheRedneck2004,Top notch,8,8 February 2003,"To be honest with you, I hate sequels to comedies. They're almost always rehashes.But every so often, a diamond in the rough comes along.  Shanghai Knights is a very fitting sequel.  It has energy, unlike many other films the past few years, it has a very ""Indiana Jones"" style to it.  Also different from other comedies: this movie has a plot. :OThe beginning is typical, someone steals something important to set things in motion.  As a student of history I found all the little nods at history (Chaplin and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle being main supporting characters, the Chinese Boxers) to be fun, while not always correct.  But, when you go see an action comedy, you don't expect historical accuracy, right? 
Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson have what most duos don't: chemistry. They work well together, and they play off each other.  Wilson's rambling tirades about the differences between America and Britain, and his constant bashing of England are hilarious.  The action pieces are top notch, and as I already mentioned, I was pleasantly surprised to find an actual story.It started off as an action/drama film with a few gags in it, then develops into humor where you're not just amused, you chuckle, then as the film progresses you start laughing out loud.  It gets funnier as it goes along, as well as becomes more dramatic.A great film, immensely entertaining.  I give it an eight, simply because it's no Star Wars, LOTR, or Gettysburg, but it's definately better than most of the junk floating around these days, and will most likely find it's way to my small DVD collection (devoid of comedies for the most part, DVDs are expensive, so I only buy movies I really really like, mostly three hour dramas. ;)).",Shanghai Knights

The only problem i had with Shanghai Knights is why they had to link some of the characters to famous people from that time, i thought this was totally uneccessary to the story and kind of put me off a little bit.

The original Shanghai Noon was a fun little film, and this one is too. But it isn't really as funny because we've seen most of it before. Most of the original humor comes from making fun of Britain, which I'm certainly not averse to.Jackie Chan choreographed the fights for the movie and seemed to have a lot more freedom than any of his past US film. If you've seen Miracles, you'll recognize the style Jackie is using here. A lot less gritty, much more funny prop use. There's a very nice fight with Donnie Yen, and all comedy bits are pretty good, especially the homage to Gene Kelly.Where the first movie was a tribute to seemingly every Western ever made, Shanghai Knights is a tribute to the physical comedians of the early cinema, with references to, among others,  the Keystone Cops, Abbott and Costello, the Marx Brothers, Buster Keaton, and of course Charlie Chaplin.

The incredibly handsome and witty Owen Wilson is hilarious as Roy.  Chan & Wilson have great onscreen chemistry.  This sequel is definitely A+ material.  It's a must-see for everyone.  The outakes at the end were a great bonus as well. It's just nice to go see a movie like this and to be entertained. Overall=excellent movie!,Shanghai Knights

If u liked the first one,u'll love the second one.The chemistry between owen wilson and jackie is much better than in the first one.

107,datasage,kung foo with a Hollywood polish,6,25 January 2003,"I saw this movie at a preview screening. What i can say about it, it just like the first one.  It does pretty well at action and comedy but don't expect more than that. Jackie Chan really doesn't act and the story is really simple. Father gets killed. Son and daughter avenge father. They save england and china from a conspircy. They attempt to make the story more believable by sticking in some historical characters. It gets some laughs but thats it.Anyway if your looking for mindless entertainment. This movie meets the mark, but don't expect more.",Shanghai Knights

109,wsp,Cheesy but fun!,8,21 January 2003,"I went and saw the premier of this movie for free :D.  I also went into this movie expecting to see just what is was meant to be, a cheesy action flick / comedy with the purpose to entertain, just like all of Jackie Chan's movies. This movie was no different.  It was fun to watch and had a lot of cool stunts and action sequences (and the outtakes at the end are always fun), which allows you to over-look issues you might have with acting or plot. I also found the era references amusing and cute.  This movie is perfect for Jackie Chan lovers.",Shanghai Knights
110,btlqt,One word to describe it--DAMN!,5,17 February 2003,"I have to be honest, during the first fifteen minutes of this movie I was scared that it was not going to hold up to the Shanghai Noon, but once Owen Wilson appeared, I was corrected. This movie contains the same wit and sarcasm along with action that made the first movie so great. Jackie Chan and Fann Wong's amazing stunts with Owen Wilson's comedic timing make this film a must see (if not in the theaters, at least rentable)",Shanghai Knights

If you're looking for lightweight, passable entertainment, this movie should satisfy your needs...7/10.",Shanghai Knights
112,tonberrykinged,A fun (and very funny) adventure,9,22 February 2008,"Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson join forces once again in this sequel to the kung-fu comedy western Shanghai Noon. Unlike the Rush Hour films this franchise seems to have plenty of life left in it - and that isn't just because Chris Tucker's nowhere to be seen! The story surrounds Chon Wang's (Chan) quest for revenge after his father is killed by a dastardly English royal with his sights set on the throne. Now living in America, he gets the chance to reunite with inept sidekick Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) who has moved to England. This is where most of the action takes place, allowing for plenty of 'fish-out-of-water' humour and general Brit-bashing. As usual, Wilson's laid back delivery hits the mark, and the chemistry between the two stars really works.Shanghai Knights features some of Chan's best fight sequences in a Hollywood movie. It's clear he's been given more time for his customary choreographic perfection than in the previous movie. Highlights include his tussle with guards in the library and the showdown with fellow kung-fu legend Donnie Yen (Hero, Iron Monkey) under heavy machine gun fire! This is one of those movies which really is for all ages. It would be a misleading to call it a family film because that would suggest a syrup laden, overly moralistic film which, thankfully, this is not (witness O'Bannon's cruel put-down on a London orphan). Shanghai Knights is that rare thing - a sequel that surpasses the original, and a Hollywood production that makes the most of Jackie's talents.Summary? A very fun (and funny) adventure.",Shanghai Knights
113,celmovies,awsome!,9,26 January 2003,"It's one of the funniest movies that I've seen in a very long time. Jackie and Owen have great chemistry and you can tell it. Also, the blooper reel at the end of the movie is a classic. I love movies that show the bloopers.",Shanghai Knights
114,yachtsman,A piece of **** !!!,1,18 February 2003,"This movie is really a piece of s**t !!!Though I went to watch this movie without any expectation, I didn't expect it was such a BAD movie. Jackie Chan was the key factor to the disaster. His acting was real bad ! His so-called ""kung-fu"" was just craps. To be precise, he's more like a circus man (a clown) rather than an action or martial art actor. Many US people may think that Jackie was a real kung-fu star. However, as a matter of fact, he does NOT know any kung fu at all. All he learned during his childhood was only some tricks used by circus people to make audiences laugh. Unlike Jackie, Donnie Yen was a real kung fu fighter. He received formal, harsh training during his childhood. He really CAN fight ! Believe it or not, he is really capable of killing a civilian (including Jackie Chan) by a punch if he wants.Another weakness of this movie is that almost 99.9% of the dialog were in English. I personally don't believe that all ancient Chinese people speak fluent English. Back at that time, there were tens or hundreds provinces in China. Each of those province had their own dialect. Some people even had difficulty in communicating with others from different provinces with another dialect. People at that time received very, very little education. They couldn't even spoke pure Mandarin (their official language). How was it possible that almost all of them knew and spoke fluent English ? Even though they did, would brother and sister spoke not at their mother-tongue but at a foreign language( English), even when they were talking privately ? That's totally ridiculous !I swear to God I will never see any movie by Jackie Chan in the future ! NEVER !!!",Shanghai Knights
115,loren1989,2003: Movies are getting off to a good start,10,1 March 2003,Shanghai Knights is the first 2003 movie I've seen and it's quite entertaining.

116,leducjjr,Great Duo,10,7 March 2003,"This is my favorite of the JC movies.  The chemistry between JC and OW is really awesome to watch.  I really prefer this duo over JC and CT in the 'Rush Hour' movies.The stunts were fast, dazzling, and incredibly artistic, as usual.  My favorites were the umbrella fight, the vase fight, and the swordplay near the end.  The vase fight was a nice take on a similar scene in a previous JC movie.Mr. Chan is a true entertainer and his charm, mixed with Mr. Owen's bluster and Ms. Wong's 'fierce kitty' screen presence makes for a delightful movie.Some of the adult humor will need to be explained to the younger kids because they will ask questions... and there is some graphic language. Not much more than you'd hear on broadcast primetime but it exists nonetheless.",Shanghai Knights
117,Sangohan,A good 2nd movie,8,3 January 2004,"Shanghai Knights is the second movie in the ""Shanghai"" theme.Jackie Chan is as always the main character in this movie and of course the Kung Fu is one of the most spectacular things about the movie.At least, that is what you would think. The story is original, funny and easily understood. It will appeal to the masses. The acting itself is also very good. Jackie Chan's English is getting better, but i wouldn't want it differently. That is one of his trademarks, and that is what we like.A very good thing is that is doesn't dwell on the first movie. There are of course the references, but if you haven't seen the first movie, you will have no problem understanding this one.What i liked is the reference to certain figures. It suggests as though they were the creator of the name ""Sherlock Holmes"".... It adds a certain realism to the movie.In short, if you want a movie with action, some kung Fu, lots of stunts and a lot of humor... this is certainly the one to pick!",Shanghai Knights

From Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Charlie Chaplin it is the best. And as usual , at the end of the movie Jackie lets you see all the mistakes , too. These alone make the movie great!

So, i wasn't too excited hearing about it. Then i saw the preview.  Looked funny.  So i went to the sneak preview tonight at 7:30... MAN THAT WAS SOOOOOOO FUNNY! It is way better than the original.  There are too many jokes.  The 1st hour feels like 10 minutes(a good thing).  It slows down but still very fast paced.  It has better fights and better humor (involving famous Europeans)  It was a well done comedy.  Jackie Chan is as good as he normally is maybe better.  Owen Wilson , did his thing great( he has a very funny dream about a bordello),  See, this movie if you want 100 minutes of laughs.7/10 stars.",Shanghai Knights
121,ricderob,Nice and no more,6,28 October 2012,"Shanghai Knights boasts an adequate story, interesting characters -loved the Scotland Yard inspector-, good acting -especially from the villains-, some funny moments, solid action scenes, cute movie and historical references, and strong production. So you can watch it confidently, knowing you're not going to get a horrid piece of junk.That's the positive side. On the negative side, the movie is thoroughly unremarkable. I only watched it last night and I'm racking my brain trying to remember something memorable about it. After a while, I can only come up with two things. The name of the Jackie Chan character cracked me up: Chon Wang -pronounced ""John Wayne"". The same as in the first part, of course, but I haven't watched that since it came out.The other thing that cracked me up ***minor spoiler start*** is that Roy blew all their money from part I by investing in zeppelins instead of cars. I thought that was pretty clever. But then there's the head-scratching moment when Roy confesses he lied, he actually lost the money publishing his book... a book that so happens to be a hit all over the country and is even well-known in England. Huh? I guess the script called for a ""confession moment"" and there was nothing else he could confess to right then ***minor spoiler end***.How does this movie compare to Shanghai Noon? Can't tell, I don't remember. As for Rush Hour (not to mention early Jackie Chan films), I found the latter to be funnier, more original and an altogether better film. But Shanghai Knights is still OK, if you're tired of rewatching old Jackie films.",Shanghai Knights

124,dvddragon,Jackie's Best movie in the last 4 years,10,3 February 2003,"I saw Shanghai Knights today and I must tell you that I really liked it. To start off, I am a big fan of Jackie's HK movies and basically I  didn't like most of the movies released after 1998.But finally I was satisfied. SK is really great; the best I have seen in the last 4 years. There is a fight sequence in the market. And Jackie returned to his (g)olden days where anything was a weapon. He used vegetables, umbrellas, ropes, ladders, weight loads and what not. He also performed his trademark ""one second"" climb up.Overall there are about 4-5 action sequences. Although Jackie used some of his tricks from his previous movies, you won't feel bored as you haven't seen them for a long time.You might have already noticed that in his new movies, he doesn't show his close-up while performing some exciting stunts. Here also I doubt if he was doubled. But in the outtakes, he revealed it was he himself on the reel at least for a couple of difficult stunts.And Owen Wilson is here to make you laugh. In SK, he proves that he is a better partner to Jackie than the over-acting Chris Tucker. His silent comic scenes are much better than Tucker's screams. Altogether a nice blend of action and comedy.After watching the whole movie, I felt proud that I am a Jackie Chan Fan. At the age of 48, he did things which his American counterparts don't do themselves.",Shanghai Knights
125,mhickcox,Too cute and contrived,3,11 February 2003,"I was disappointed with Shanghai Knights.  Most laughs were contrived and a reversal of the same guffaws from Shanghai Noon.

Many times we don't see Chan's acting ability but this one shows that he has depth as an actor, plus his exciting, funny and highly elaborative action sequences. One of Chan's best!

I'd hate to see further unknowing cinema lovers subjected to this tripe.",Shanghai Knights

A few good fight scenes, but not nearly enough to balance the inconsistencies and loopholes in the plot. Where are the guys getting all the money to live in London? Were there really automobiles in 1888? Chan and Wilson have great chemistry, and Jackie has one or two great fight scenes, but a lack of credibility in the script make this a disappointing comedy.",Shanghai Knights

While I didn't split either side laughing hysterically, I did laugh a lot.  It's a little predictable, but Jackie Chan movies are known more for the mind-boggling action anyways, so I couldn't complain.  I had to look past historical fact to enjoy the film, but the historic cultural figures portrayed in this film added to the humor.  I'd definitely suggest renting this if you're looking to enjoy an evening with friends (preferably who haven't seen it).  Sidenote:  I didn't see the first film (""Shanghai Noon""), but my friend said this sequel was actually better than the first.",Shanghai Knights
138,afexion8,Jackie's Still Got It!,8,21 January 2003,"I just saw a preview tonight, and I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoy Jackie Chan, and ""Shanghai Noon"" was fun, but I was sure that a sequel would be really stretching it, and result in a bland formulaic bore, or a mediocre re-hash of past Chan films. Well, it is not bland, and it's not a bore, but many scenes from many films are re-hashed, alluded to, or spoofed. I don't know how they managed to squeeze in so many references to other wildly different films, from ""Abbott and Costello Meet Dracula"" to ""Singin' in the Rain"" to ""Billy Elliot"" - but it works!The plot of ""Shanghai Knights"" is a bit more intense (and I think interesting) than ""Noon"", but there is still no real suspense or surprises - so what? There is ample opportunity for Jackie Chan to do what he does better than anyone. It is the unique, seemingly effortless, lightning-quick acrobatics/dance moves/fight scenes by Chan that will amaze you and entertain you throughout. He seems as quick, strong, and flexible as ever, and he manages to improvise some ""new"" props to fight with along the way. (A revolving door, umbrellas, lemons - is there anything that he hasn't used in a fight?)His ""baby sister"" is a fantastic addition to the cast, and shows off plenty of amazing moves of her own. Wow! She can climb better than Spider-Man (but her outfit is not as revealing).And, of course, the outtakes were hilarious - I laughed til I cried. Maybe the funniest set of outtakes yet. Don't leave early!""Shanghai Knights"" is a fun, silly romp, that is also very entertaining and quite unique. (I'm not sure where the ""Knights"" part comes in. I didn't see any.) I can't wait to see it again, to see what I missed while I was laughing so hard.And - I even think they should make another sequel. Let's call it ""Shanghai Mourning"" - get it? Mourning, Noon and Knight!",Shanghai Knights
139,allidee,"Cookie cutter, but worth it...",7,24 January 2003,"First let me preface this review by saying I'm an Owen Wilson fan. I think I could watch the guy read the yellow pages and laugh. That being said, his humor alone made this movie worth seeing. It's more of his trademark stuff - bizarre comments made with unique delivery. So bottom line, if you like Owen Wilson, you'll like this movie. (And I suspect if you're a Jackie Chan fan, you'll like it, too.) I saw it as part of a free sneak-preview, but I'd have paid to see it...maybe not the full price, but a matinee price...As for the rest - it's a comedy, not a creative masterpiece. It followed the recipe of the first movie (Shanghai Noon) and in my opinion it wasn't quite as good, but that's probably because the first one was a novelty. This one, you knew what to expect in terms of the buddy relationship and the type of humor.The plot is very thin - Chon's father is killed in a plot to overturn 2 governments, and both Chon - with Roy - and his sister set out to a) set things straight and b) avenge their father's death. But the plot is really only the sideshow. The main attraction(s) are the Chon/Roy relationship and the fight scenes. I'm not at all qualified to comment on the fight scenes, so I'll leave that to the real kung fu buffs, but suffice it to say they were impressive and dang these guys are FAST and Jackie Chan is wicked clever/creative.There are plenty of sub plots (Roy having the hots for Lin, the father-son angst felt by Chon, the little orphan kid's fate, etc.) to make up for the lack of depth in the main story line. And there are more characters in this one that get further developed. You truly hate ""Rathboner,"" think Yip is fiendish, and Lin is possibly more of a hero than Chon or Roy. So in spite of the weak main dish, there's plenty of tasty side dishes to fill you up.
As for performances - clearly there are no Oscar contenders, but I thought they were good. Jackie and Owen were in usual form. Jackie showed some emotion that I liked. Fann Wong joins the ranks of other ass-kicking babes. She's a nice strong female character with the right amount of vulnerability. I thought Donnie Yen's character left a bit to be desired, but he had a good fight scene with Jackie. I just didn't have the visceral hate for him that I did for Rathbone (Aiden Gillen). He was truly despicable in every way. Well done. Lastly, the little orphan (who will remain nameless in this review) was funny and added a nice component to the story. The Yard Inspector was bumbling and waaaayyy stereotyped... I wasn't moved much by him.Bottom line: I think this movie accomplishes what it set out to do. I laughed out loud A LOT, I marveled at the fight scenes, and I became more enamored with both Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. And the out-takes at the end were as funny as all get out.So, not quite as good as the first, but definitely entertaining. And that's my humble, but honest opinion.",Shanghai Knights
140,dan5262,If you dont like this movie the problem is with YOU not the film.,10,8 February 2003,"If anybody says this movie is not funny they have a problem. Owen Wilson has a very hard to understand comedy style. Many weak minded peoples may not understand such greatness. He is one of the funniest humans in the business. (note that i said ""humans"") Jackie Chan is the best martial artist/actor in the world. He is a GOD AMONG MEN. His funny and amazing fight scenes are more than half of this movies appeal.The combination of these two talents makes for one very ecentric and goood movie. Some movie critics may say this movie is corny and stupid, but who cares what they think because we are all able to think on our own.

The time just flew by and I found myself wanting more of ""Shanghai Knights.""  It obviously met its objective since it clearly was not trying to be ""Gone With the Wind.""Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan have a remarkable chemistry together and it's a privilege to watch them work.

It's a straight forward sequel, almost like an expansion to use computer language. The fights are funnier than in Noon though and Owen Wilson is always really funny. The worst thing about this movie is the ending I guess. You know what's gonna happen and it's just too slow towards the end. Altogether it's a decent flick but a bit of a disappointment. They could've and should've made more out of this movie. If you want comedy check out Old School instead and if you want Owen Wilson you're better of watching The Royal tennenbaums over again.
