0,Woodyanders,Stark portrait of one very bad man,8,16 November 2021,"New York homicide investigators undercover a slew of videocassettes at an old abandoned house in Poughkeepsie, New York. Said tapes depict the heinous exploits of cunning, evasive, and sadistic serial killer Edward Carver (a frighteningly convincing portrayal by Ben Messmer).Writer/director John Eric Dowdle ingeniously utilizes a deliberately rough around the edges pseudo documentary style complete with interviews with various relatives and law enforcers, a few dramatic reenactments, and degraded VHS footage of the psycho's horrible acts that works like gangbusters when it comes to creating and sustaining a deeply creepy and disturbing mood.Moreover, the unflinchingly dark, grim, and nihilistic tone along with the fact that the killer is till at large at the end gives this picture an extra chilling edge. Stacy Chbosky contributes a stand-out turn as abducted teen and lone survivor Cheryl Dempsey. A very potent and upsetting film.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
1,BA_Harrison,I wanted to believe,5,9 July 2016,"The Poughkeepsie Tapes is a faux documentary featuring found footage of a serial killer's handiwork. Through interviews with FBI profilers, the police, and the families and friends of the victims, and with excerpts from the murderer's videotapes (horribly distorted imagery: next time, Mr. Killer, buy a better camera!), we learn how the murderer has successfully evaded capture.I've seen an awful lot of found-footage horror/pseudo-snuff in my time, some of which has achieved a level of realism that has bordered on the limits of what I will watch. But despite it's controversial reputation, I didn't find The Poughkeepsie Tapes in the least bit shocking, largely because at no point was I convinced that what I was watching was real.Some of the acting was very weak, which certainly didn't help (those girl scouts selling cookies were dreadful), but the main problems I had were with the killer, who wasn't in the least bit intimidating (his voice and ridiculous costumery were laughable), and the fact that no genuine documentary would ever show uncensored footage of dismembered victims, as this did.I wanted to believe and become fully immersed in the movie, but in the end I couldn't, and that seriously spoiled the experience.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
2,michaelRokeefe,Engrossing and very disturbing.,8,4 February 2018,"Director John Erick Dowdle tracks a criminal from start to finish. A cunning serial killer (Ben Messmer) leaves a gruesome trail. Police storm an empty house in New York, but what they find is provoking. Hundreds of tapes are found and they provide an orderly arranged presentation of years worth of videotaped torture and murder. Brutal, horrific and gut twisting. It will not be hard to figure out why this film is rated R. May not be your cup of tea, but I sure got into it.The director helped his brother Drew Dowdle write. Atmosphere and special effects at time seems uneven, but believable. The cast includes: Stacy Chbosky, Samantha Robson, Ivar Brogger, Amy Lyndon, Lou George and Kim Kenny.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
3,Hey_Sweden,It doesn't live up to the hype.,5,8 October 2021,"""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" treads on very familiar ground for any movie watcher who's used to serial killer dramas. Functioning as a faux documentary, it relates the tale of a particularly odious monster, Edward Carver (Ben Messmer). Sadistic and creepy in the extreme, Edward has taken the time to document *practically every second* of the stalking, abduction, and torture of his victims. So investigators have had to go through tape after tape of some very sick stuff. We get to see how this crafty and slick psycho has managed to elude the authorities for a long time.The filmmaking Dowdle brothers make a serious effort at shocking and disturbing their viewers, but all of this may have had more impact if this viewer hadn't been somewhat inured to this sort of material over the years. The main problem is, this viewer was never convinced that he was watching something ""real"". Part of that is due to some very amateurish acting. And part of that is due to the fact that Messmer is not really successful at making his villain truly menacing in any way. One way that a viewer can tell this is fictional is the way that the Dowdles take the time to wallow in depravity and gore when an actual documentary would be more likely to exercise restraint rather than go for sensationalism.Despite the reputation of ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"", it would ultimately be much more interesting - and genuinely disturbing - to watch or revisit ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"", the real high water mark as far as this kind of film goes.Five out of 10.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
4,trashgang,disturbing lost flick,8,7 September 2015,"Another found-footage flick that people said, you must see it and I tried to track it down, for years. When it came out it vanished from the planet like nothing, it never had a proper release or was seen in the theaters. Strange things went on with this flick and even up to today it doesn't have a proper release, only available on VOD. So I thought yeah well, this is going to be a terrible flick if it didn't has a release but God was I wrong.Must say that I was warned that it was a disturbing flick and yes, it was. Always loved flicks about serial killers and this found footage is one with that theme. We do follow the cops trying to nail the killer and slowly we do see the video's the killer has left behind and it all starts so easy and low profile but towards the end it really get you by the throat. Even as it isn't that gory at all still the score used and the way it is filmed you will forget that you are watching a film. You are dragged into a documentary and into the sickness of a killer's mind.As strange as The Poughkeepsie Tapes is it is a gem. It was made a good two years before the receding tide of found footage flicks out now. Due to budget concerns they may have pulled the plug on the promising film. This is all really speculation, for there was never any public statements about the decision to not distribute the film. MGM still owns the rights, and other studios have offered to buy it. The hole might be dug too deep now, the film is possibly no longer culturally relevant for a theatrical release, and the studio may be hiding in the underbrush, waiting to pounce it on an unsuspecting public. The fear that is may get lost in the already crowded sea of found footage trash to sift out of Hollywood. A second release date was scheduled for January 2, 2009 but that date too faded into memory. A must see.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
5,HumanoidOfFlesh,"Murder is clean in ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"".",5,13 January 2009,"""The Poughkeepsie Tapes""-a faux documentary about the activities of the mixed serial killer from Poughkeepsie called The Waterstreet Butcher garnered tons of hype before its official release.The premise of the film is certainly interesting:the police raids a home of suspect and finds it empty aside from boxes of VHS tapes.On these video cassettes are hundreds of hours of footage recorded by a serial killer as he filmed the abductions,torture,murder and disposal of his victims.""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" plays like a tame version of ""August Underground"" series.The amount of violence and terror is surprisingly minimal.What drags ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" down is truly horrible acting.The interviews with investigators(there is even laughable ""dismemberment expert"")are terrible as was the archive footage of court proceedings and press conferences.The killer is also ridiculous as he giggles and yells and acts more like a total buffoon.""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" is not shocking or disturbing.The torture and murder scenes are usually off-screen and they lack a bite.If you want to see truly horrifying serial killer movie check out Austrian ""Angst"" from 1983.5 out of 10.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
6,StevePulaski,Terrifyingly terrifying,9,2 June 2012,"I've been seeking a resource to watch The Poughkeepsie Tapes since I saw the original trailer in 2008. After that, no word was ever spoken about the film again. I heard of no release, no screenings, and no mainstream DVD. What happened? As of today, at least to me, it's all still a mystery. Finally, I have seen the film in its entirety, and I hesitate not to label it one of the creepiest faux documentaries I have yet to see.Found footage films are a dime a dozen, with already several released this year alone. They are an easy way to make a buck; shoot a film for no more than roughly five million dollars, and wind up making an explosive profit. It's as easy as that. Very few bring such motivation, confidence, and shining capabilities to screen, but The Poughkeepsie Tapes pleasingly differentiates itself from just another fake piece of work in the sea. Many found footage pictures today occupy a certain cinematic quality about them. Some of them, like the extraordinarily underwhelming Paranormal Activity 3, feel a tad too polished, and because of the extreme popularity of the franchise, seem to have taken a much more Hollywood route. The Poughkeepsie Tapes doesn't do that, and always remains in the field of campiness and believability.It centers around the humble town of Poughkeepsie, New York, where, after police raid a house in the city, a stash of over eight-hundred VHS tapes of grisly murders committed by a sadistic man behind the camera are found. They are greatly detailed, even with static in the background and color and audio distortion personifying such an effective state of realism that I am without words. I've raved about cinematography and atmosphere in films many, many times before, but here, it is beyond haunting. A work of photography and directorial skill of immense levels.We are presented with interviews of FBI officials, psychologists, police offers, victims' parents, and more. Every so often, the clips are punctuated by a videotape itself, showing one of the killers' acts of torment or assault. I was hauntingly reminded of August Underground, a dirty, degrading picture that showed two nameless characters running around going on a sick and unjustifiable murdering spree. The Poughkeepsie Tapes occupies more than just mindless snuff, but depth, efficient backstory, and impeccable detail in its photography, execution, and realism.Some of his first tapes show him praying on the innocuous and the vulnerable. One of those is Jennifer Gorman, an eight year old girl playing in her front yard with her dolls, who is beaten over the head and abducted by the killer. As time goes on, his killings expand to acts that had to have required planning, strategy, along with a touch of crazy. One of the victims we closely identify with goes by the name of Cheryl Dempsey, a teenage girl whom he kidnaps one night while she is alone with her boyfriend. She is abused sexually and physically, being kept in his basement, as well as being referred to as ""slave,"" which he continuously hammers into her head as her new name.As the film progresses, things become deeper, more intriguing, and inevitably, more and more consuming. Images and sequences increasingly become exceptionally haunting, some of them for some people could be scaring, and many are some of the finest work in the genre from the last decade. John Erik Dowdle has effectively created a brilliant horror gem, one of keen timing and direction, and one of style and detail that doesn't rely solely on loud, abrupt musical chords and cheap exploitative jump scares. It sets itself up to be an involving piece for those seeking one, and allows itself to be discussed long after the credits finish rolling. Stay after if you're interested in seeing one more terrifying shot.NOTE: For those interested in seeing the film in its entirety, the full film has been posted on Youtube in one convenient part, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsuTTMiSScc Starring: Bobbi Sue Luther, Samantha Robson, Ivar Brogger, and Iris Bahr.

7,KineticSeoul,If your into the horror found footage genre it's watchable,5,13 September 2016,"I remember this movie being advertised a long long time ago and wondered why it wasn't hitting theaters. With the success of the found footage genre when it comes to profit. They probably wanted to cash in, but they put some thought into this one. Not to say this has a lot of psychological depth or anything like that. But it does have that gritty and raw feel to it that was prevalent in the 80's. This is basically a fake found footage movie that goes is a sort of trippy and psychedelic direction when it comes to how it was shot. The routine torture and murder seemed to drag on and on and would have been somewhat effective if the acting was good. But you can clearly tell the actors were well...Acting. I know that sometimes the mystery adds to the fear effect, but a bit more psychological depth would have made it more effective. I mean this is a fake found footage and documentary about a serial killer and rapist. Who is crazy and yet very methodical and knows how to frame and clean up the evidence. I will say that when it delved into one of the victims Cheryl Dempsey's story-line it did get a bit interesting with the stockholm syndrome and all. The first hour was routine and tedious, however after a hour into the movie it does get a bit intriguing but it takes too long to get to that point. Overall, if you are into the horror genre it's watchable.5.5/10",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
8,Ed-Shullivan,Kudos to the director/producer for distributing a serial killer film done on a shoestring budget,6,12 February 2020,"Okay so this homemade small market film was written/directed and produced on a shoestring budget, and thus the results were not expected to be of epic proportions as the much bigger budget(s) of either The Silence of the Lambs (1991), and/or Hannibal (2001). Knowing in advance that the Poughkeepsie Tapes was produced and directed by independent film makers I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning performance in the acting and/or the cinematography, but what I did get was an impressive enough THRILLER genre film which kept my interest sustained throughout.No doubt there are many areas of improvement that can be recommended for The Poughkeepsie Tapes, but not for the miniscule budget and short timeline (30 days?) that the film makers most likely had to work within. I am taking into consideration what others may have been able to accomplish with the same restrictions that this team had and I must say that I am impressed with their end result.I make no false claims as it is a grade B level film at best, but having said that I have watched a heck of a lot of films with 100-1,000 times larger budgets and timelines and with major Hollywood stars promoting their less than stellar films that were a lot worse than the Poughkeepsie Tapes.I have zero affiliation with the film makers so please do not assume I am providing a generous complimentary review as I am no more than an enthusiastic film lover of the Thriller/Serial Killer genre and if you are too than please appreciate this Grade B film for what is their end result on a shoestring budget and a 30 day timeline (I found this tidbit out by watching the writer/director extras included on the Blu Ray release)A decent 6 out of 10 rating",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
9,marmar-69780,the poughkeepsie tapes,8,24 May 2020,"The poughkeepsie tapes is one effective but also little disturbing film in which is shown how mind and brain of psychotic serial killer works and operates,i dont think that this film is one of best in its genre,mostly cause it didnt offered nothing new to genre and some scenes were just made to disturb people and for nothing else,but i will also say that to me some scenes were unsetteling and i found them to be chilling and effective,acting was fine for this kind of film,but it had some unconvincing moments also some plot points were to hollywood like and not like documentry type like rest of film was,poughkeepsie tapes was a fine horror with some disturbing staff",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
10,jtindahouse,A very good horror film with only a couple of flaws holding it back,7,29 November 2017,"There are only two things holding 'The Poughkeepsie Tapes' back from being a truly great movie. The first is the acting. My goodness it is shocking in some scenes. It's rare for a movie released as recently as 2007 to have acting this bad. The girl trying to pop the balloon is possibly the worst piece of acting I can remember seeing. The second thing is the inclusion of some scenes in the final cut. This is supposed to be a (fake obviously) documentary on a serial killer and yet there are a tremendous amount of things that would simply never be shown in any real documentary (explicit patient records spoken out loud by a doctor is a very obvious one that comes to mind). Apart from those two things though I have to say I quite liked this film.This is an exceedingly dark film, make no mistake about that. It was made without a conscious, and I quite like that quality in a film. There is also one element to the story (revolving around 9/11) that I found very innovative, creative and original. It's one of those things that keeps you thinking after the film is finished. This certainly isn't for the faint of heart, however if you're up to it you may just find yourself very much enjoying 'The Poughkeepsie Tapes'.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
11,jadavix,"Tedious, failed attempt at realism through mixture of found footage and documentary style testimonials",4,20 May 2021,"The ""Poughkeepsie Tapes"" is one of those movies that mixes found footage with documentary style testimonials from people somehow related to the footage. I believe a similar thing was done with ""Lake Mungo"" and maybe some other movies.This approach just does not work for me. Found footage can be amazingly effective. But the testimonials? Every time they come on the movie grinds to a halt. These add nothing in terms of realism: I can't help thinking the actors just look uncomfortable and wish they were shooting a typical scene. It's like they are scared of the camera and resent having to acknowledge it.In fact, the documentary-like aspects of the movie are its downfall. It would have been much better without those, or with far fewer intrusions of this kind. The movie's killer isn't even that interesting. The deluge of talking heads, and the uninteresting sparse grainy footage, make you realise how one-dimensional this villain is. You wonder why they spent so long analysing his activities, especially when the movie tells you there's fifty serial killers in the US at any given time. What makes this one so interesting?All the talking heads, and all the documentary footage, don't answer this question.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
12,kevin_robbins,This is a bit underrated and was definitely entertaining,8,26 October 2021,"The Poughkeepsie Tapes (2007) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a mockumentary about a series of tapes found by the FBI filmed by a ruthless serial killer of various children, prostitutes and others he kidnapped and tortured over who knows how long in various locations and states. Can the FBI leverage these tapes to find out who is responsible for them? This movie is directed by John Erick Dowdle (Quarantine) and stars Stacy Chbosky (No Escape), Ben Messmer (Bold Native), Samantha Robson (A Good Year), Ivar Brogger (Jersey Boys) and Amy Lyndon (The House that Jack Built). The stories and documentary style delivery was actually pretty well done. The videos were fantastic and the torture and kill scenes were very entertaining. My favorite was obviously the balloon idea. Brilliant. The masks and circumstances were so good, random and well contrived. There's also some great gore and props used for the torture and kill sequences. This was very clever and believable. The story is also very good and fascinating. This is a bit underrated and was definitely entertaining. I'd score this a solid 8/10 and recommend seeing it.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
13,atinder,"This movie really good chilling moment also as really silly moments,",6,3 April 2013,"The Poughkeepsie Tapes (2007) I have tried watch a number of times before, I could never really get into the movie and again I saw half of it yesterday and I saw the last half of it today. It did take me while to get in this movie, I do like the video being balloons at times and there was some good tense and chilling moment in this movie. If wasn't for the really poor acting from most of the cast and some scripts sounded a little to fake (I would Easily believed this was real) however it NOT real and I know that. I Thought did have powerfully story and some good chilling moment in this movie, that might make you thing, the next you see stranger.Small spoiler I found is bit silly for Killer to go and see the mother of the girl He Kidnapped only for mother not doing anything knowing he was kidnapperIt was really some- what entertaining. 6/10 Good movie",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
14,JoeB131,A more effective use of Found Footage,6,10 October 2020,"Found Footage has been done to death. This one actually is a slightly better because they make sense. It's a compilation of found footage from a serial killer, news reports, interviews with experts and witnesses... So it actually has a little more of a realistic feel than, let's say, the person who is still holding their camera phone steady while the Zombie Apocalypse breaks out.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
15,drownnnsoda,"Engrossing simulation of the ""true crime"" docu-format",9,28 December 2018,"""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" follows the travails of a serial killer in upstate New York known as the ""Water Street Butcher,"" utilizing interviews with various talking heads (criminologists, police officers, family members of victims, etc.) paired with footage from a cache of VHS tapes the killer kept documenting his egregious crimes spanning the 1990s.I recall seeing the trailer for ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" at a screening of ""The Mist"" in 2007, and followed earnestly as it got pulled by MGM and fell into the world of online lore. In some ways, it has lent the film an appropriate mythology, though it was frustrating for genre fans who truly wanted to see it. Watching it all these years later now that it's been released, I found myself pleasantly surprised, as it doesn't seem to have aged at all since it was made over a decade ago.Some reviewers have criticized the film for being plot-less or scarce on characters, but these are both really just the nature of the beast here-it's a ""true crime"" documentary, and the filmmakers make an earnest attempt to weave some sort of narrative into the proceedings; at times this is to its own detriment, but the subplot featuring the killer's slave victim, Cheryl Dempsey (effectively played by director John Dowdle's wife, Stacy Chbosky) is well-incorporated. The real show, however, is the contents of the killer's tapes themselves, which are interspersed with fairly convincing faux news footage and interviews with ""officials"" examining the case. The killer's home movies are at times legitimately disturbing, and some moments are difficult to watch even with the intellectual understanding of their fictionality. The grittiness of the tapes themselves anchor the film in a truth that feels raw and unrestrained, and results in an overall effective film.For fans of real true crime media, ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" proves an entertaining sort of simulation of the true crime documentary format that has only grown in popularity over the last decade. The film functions as a thrill ride of sorts, filling in the blanks that actual true crime documentaries inherently contain; it fills the void with a direct window into the criminal's sickest fantasies. Faked or not, there are images in the film that are harrowing. 9/10.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
16,jfgibson73,Seriously Messed Up,4,17 February 2011,"Fake documentary about a serial killer who was so good he never got caught. Part of the movie has investigators talking about the crimes, and the other half is home video footage the killer shot. We see him abducting a variety of victims, torturing them in a dungeon-like environment, and killing them.Having watched a lot of low budget movies, I can usually accept a low standard for acting. In this movie, however, it was different. The actors playing the law enforcement roles were so forced, it was distracting. On the other hand, the scenes that were meant to be the killer's footage were pretty believable and much more naturalistic. That's probably what highlighted how bad the analysis segments were.Some very disturbing content with imagery that has stuck with me. Not sure how to rate it. Part of the movie is poorly done (the talking heads), and the other half is sadistic. For people who are into messed up stuff.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
17,begob,"Good, but not a horror.",6,12 September 2014,"Well paced, but it reminds me of some real-crime US documentaries from the '70s, so not an original.It is unpleasant, but no jump scares and no tension. So it's not a horror either - although there is a disturbing murder at 1:09.The interviews to camera aren't convincing - I guess that's difficult to get right, to balance script and improv with good editing. The two main characters are interesting. I think they showed too much of the killer in his mask and ruff - gave the impression of a dramatic bloviator, which ruined the deliberate mystery for me. The interview with Cheryl was a chance to make a great story, to show how she was in love yet doomed, show us the real killer. But it was just a bit sad.The decision to use ""authentic"" '80s sound & vid quality for the first half was a bad call - although it had some effect, I found it irritating. The soundtrack relies on discord at scary moments, elsewhere a soft xylophone rhythm.Well worth a watch, but it me no horror makey.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
18,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,A chilling albeit unrealistic pseudo-documentary,6,14 March 2017,"Usually I hate these found-footage styled movies. They're often shaky, full of bad lines and an excuse for producers to skimp out on expensive editing. I am a big fan of horror though, and of the VHS format. There's something strangely captivating and nostalgic about those bright contrasting colours and flickers of tape tracking across the screen. That being said, after seeing the brutal sadism within this story that goes beyond normal for most horror, it didn't scare me per-say but it came across like the producers were trying too hard for shock value.The Poughkeepsie Tapes throws together every serial killer trope from the media, borrowing from the disturbing and meticulous crimes of murderers and molesters like John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy (both of whom if I recall were actually mentioned in the film), and of course we get some elements from unsolved cold cases like the JonBenet Ramsey murder. There are even a few themes similar to fictional films such as The Lovely Bones (2009) and Sinister (2012). Sometimes though it felt like The Poughkeepsie Tapes didn't know which direction it was going in. We've got this serial killer without much of a purpose, who seems to be a sociopath, who uses a girl as his ""slave"", whose crimes have no motive or similarities (of course, this killer is also supposed to be some kind of genius doing different murder styles each time to throw of the cops, of course), oh and let's not forget, he's also a fetishist for scantily-clad women sitting on giant balloons and bouncing on them. O-kay, yeah. This comes across as neither frightening nor creepy, but rather just bizarre.We also have his VHS tapes, which are quite well-done for an indie film although it's obvious that the VHS footage was tampered with on purpose for a low-grade quality effect. Yet the events occurring on each tape all have more of an early Eighties vibe than a Nineties vibe. Watching them had me immediately thinking back to that period when the two polar opposites of the news, both the sensationalist and the fluff, began to emerge, which would be the Eighties. The popping bright colours also give a more Eighties atmosphere than a Nineties one. If the VHS tapes hadn't been such a central plot device to the story I probably wouldn't care as much, but it does seem like The Poughkeepsie Tapes is definitely set in the wrong era.I absolutely loved the eerie, ambient soundtrack. The acting was okay, nothing special but not terrible, either. Sometimes ""Ed"" the Poughkeepsie killer seemed quite over-the-top, to the point where his angry screaming of ""POP IT!"" to one of the balloon girls and his angry rant at Cheryl Dempsey seemed more comedic than scary. I've seen better performances frankly in my high school drama class. Ed's entire character was utterly ridiculous. I don't mean to sound all pretentious but nothing about him felt real. Even sociopaths and nihilists usually have some underlying motive in their crimes. The ones who kill simply because they love blood and guts are the ones who always get caught and arrested right away because they see it as a sick game. Ed just wasn't realistic enough to be scary. What was more disturbing in this film than Ed himself is the psychological grief and turmoil of the victims' families, especially Cheryl's mother, who finds herself going through the supposed ""five stages of grief"" blatantly on-screen before accepting Cheryl's death, only to discover that Ed has not killed Cheryl at all but instead turned her into a mentally-ill shell of her former self who later commits suicide.As a film working by acting as a fake documentary, The Poughkeepsie Tapes is not really a slasher picture and won't give any fans of that genre the frequent elaborate murders they are expecting. It does tend to drag on a lot while still having quite a powerful atmosphere. Evidently a lot of effort went into this film; we get aerial shots of Poughkeepsie itself in all its Autumn glory. We get numerous types of found footage from different years. We get references to significant historical events of the time, such as the tragedy of 9/11. I did enjoy it; with horror films I often find that less is more. Gratuitous violence, sex, profanity and blood can just make a film look cheesy. This one isn't one of my favourites and I think a lot could have been improved upon, but I did still like it. The Poughkeepsie Tapes was filmed in 2007 but mysteriously held back from its release date until 2014, which I wonder was possibly an attempt to create anticipation from a crowd of moviegoers, the suggestion of ""this is that film they didn't want you to see"".",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
19,Analog_Devotee,A PRIME EXAMPLE OF WELL-MADE HARDCORE HORROR!,9,28 April 2021,"This is a prime example of well-made hardcore horror. No reliance on the supernatural to facilitate fear, just a human scumbag not far off from the many we've come to know through true crime docs and books; more than enough to scare the hell out of anyone. It's not fun-horror or the cheese a lot of us horror fans love to gorge ourselves on, it's brutal, and at times jarring in realism.The female performances (specifically the victims) are the ones that stand out the most here. If I had no prior knowledge of this film and you were to pluck a couple of specific scenes out for me to watch with zero context, I'd have believed you if you told me they were real, and it's all because of how well the women here portray fear.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the guy who plays the killer. His most convincing scene was probably his conversation with the woman inside the ""police"" vehicle. Other than that, though, he's not the best, and I thought the decision to have him wear that stupid plague doctor mask was abhorrent. In the end, I only knocked off one point for it.The performances in the mock interviews were also, for the most part, very well done. Aside from one interviewee mentioning how his wife reacted to something, I found the dialogue to be extremely believable, and I commend the writers for that. The divulgence of plot-thickening details through these interviews was also well executed; perfectly timed, believable, and a specific one involving a police officer jaw-dropping. They really weaved this into a gripping story, which in turn makes the brutal scenes much more effective because there's not enough time to become desensitized by a constant geyser of viscera.Timing is everything when it comes to building considerable tension, and these writers nailed it. Knowing when to give it and when to yank it away, when to punch and when to retreat. For anyone who has played the Resident Evil video games and are familiar with the calm serenity of the ""save rooms,"" that's what these interview segments also act as. You're thankful to not be witnessing some sickening atrocity, but sooner or later you're gonna get thrown back in, and you can't help but wonder what messed-up stuff you'll be faced with this time. Better breathe during the interviews, because you'll be holding it outside of them.One reviewer mentioned that everyone who watches this film seems to have a specific scene that sticks with them forever. Most say it's the mime mask, which, I have to say, was very creepy and I loved the camera angle. I don't want to be very specific about the scene that stuck with me for fear of ruining it for anyone else, so I'll be vague: there's a scene towards the end where a victim is interviewed; her apprehensive dialogue, as well as a certain reveal after a movement of one of her arms, caught me completely off guard. It's probably the first time I've ever shouted ""Holy ****!"" at my television.As the credits rolled, a random cover blurb I'd seen on a Wrath James White novel a few years ago popped into my mind. It was written by widely-renowned horror novelist Jack Ketchum, and it said, ""If Wrath James White doesn't make you cringe, you must be riding in the wrong end of a hearse."" That pretty well sums up how I feel about anyone who doesn't come away from this film at least a little disturbed.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

Have professionals and other schmucks talk about the tapes, the motive of the killer and other boring crap. That's it pretty much. Watch disturbing footage of the killer and listen to bums.I call the people schmucks and bums because I'm talking about their acting skills. The acting in this movie is awful. This flick and the Blair Witch type way they try to make you believe what you're watching is real, failed miserably. There isn't a second of this movie where the writing or acting succeeds. Right from the get go, if you have any clue whatsoever in what you're watching, you'll realize it's fake. And that is where the movie needed to succeed. But it wasn't even slightly believable and thus, the movie turned into a major turd sandwich.I do have to admit I enjoyed the way the killer would talk to his soon-to-be victims. It was calm and friendly and kinda silly. So that was a good thing. Also, I do have to give credit where credit is due. It's pretty clear that the makers really did try to make a legit pseudo documentary flick. So nice job at trying to make a good film. Just do a better job casting and directing your actors. And writing, that stunk too.Sure I know I sound like a douche but when it comes down to horror flicks that create zero scares, zero chills, and flat-out zero horror, then I just gotta bash it. It boggles my mind that this flick had any type of hype surrounding it. Okay, enough of this stupid review, time to get back to Ren and Stimpy.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
21,deatman9,A chilling movie!,6,19 October 2012,I watched this movie the other night and I was pleasantly surprised. The acting is was really good from the serial killer it was a very creepy performance. The acting from the rest of the crew was not that good but this movie is definitely worth a watch.This movie is a found footage mockumentary. So the movie takes off with a bunch of interviews of police and FBI who found hundreds of tapes containing murders and torture.This movie was actually better then I thought it would be. It was actually really creepy. The bad quality of the camera kind of annoyed me but it was good overall,The Poughkeepsie Tapes
22,Movi3DO,Creepy And Intense Mockumentary,8,8 March 2021,"Heard about this movie on YouTube so I watched it on Amazon Prime. This is a mockumentary about the tapes found from a home of a mysterious and sadistic serial killer.What a creepy thriller. Some of the footages shown were suspenseful and gripping. I found myself on the edge and silent, witnessing the horror and creepiness of the video. The killer was quite mysterious and disturbing, and we didn't know much about him as a person, which made the mystery even more creepy and entertaining. I liked this aspect because if we knew too much about his background, it would not make sense and decrease the suspense.The biggest problem of the movie was that some of the premise and technicality made the mockumentary felt less real. The killer was quite exaggerated and seemed to have many combinations of many serial killers' characteristics. The dialogues that some of the actors who played the interviewee felt not very realistic. The most noticeable one was the footages, which were distorted a bit too much. The intent was to make the videos more real, but I thought they went a bit too far. Also, the footages had background music. I knew that they wanted to make the footages more suspenseful, in which the music did its job, but I believed that the effect would still work well without the music while making the footages more realistic.Overall, a creepy, suspenseful, and disturbing mockumentary. Definitely had a great time despite the flaws. 8/10",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

There has never been a more realistic found footage film ever. However if you are easily frightened, and have a delicate sensibility, then : Don't ever watch this movie! It is too well produced, and too real. I have not seen it for year, but it still makes me think hard about people to this day. Warning this movie will effect you, and you can not unsee it. I'm not joking though you can not handle this movie. You will be sorry, or you won't. But you will be changed.

24,asda-man,Scary doesn't always equal good.,6,29 July 2013,"I saw The Poughkeepsie Tapes on Youtube as the film is virtually impossible to find on DVD, thus the experience might've been slightly marred by the sub-par quality, especially as the film itself is constructed to look like an old camcorder. My feelings towards it are very mixed. Did the film scare me? Yes, it absolutely did. I didn't think that it would and I kept lying to myself that it wasn't scary, when in fact I was actually quite scared and I don't scare too easily. Yes, I watched it on my own in the middle of the night, but I do that with lots of horror films and they never usually scare me. When it was over as soon as I moved I chills crept up my spine and I kept thinking about it. It certainly disturbed me and got under my skin which is a good thing. There are some very, very effective scenes. In particular, the crawling scene which is exceptionally well done and the interview with Cheryl is very unsettling. I also loved the masks, they were really creepy, especially Cheryl's female Michael Myers mask.However, was this film good? No, not overly. The first thing that struck me was the acting by the FBI people etc. they were very wooden which took the realism out of the film. They also had some very contrived lines to say such as, ""My wife watched half an hour of the tapes and she couldn't touch me for a year."" and, ""If this gets to theatres, the killer will be watching regularly."" This dialogue to me seemed like an over the top attempt to scare the audience, but it actually treats them like morons because we know it's not real and we know that the killer is not sitting next to us in the cinema... Mainly because the film didn't even reach cinemas which is actually a shame because it's still a lot better than a lot of films on currently.There were also quite a few dull moments and little to no plot development. I know that it's supposed to be a mockumentary but there needs to be more to it than just watching a killer do sick things to people. Although a lot of the tapes did have some disturbing moments, like him talking to kids etc. this didn't really add much to the film. One of the more interesting and disturbing ideas was unfortunately glossed over, which was the killer's bizarre balloon fetish. There weren't enough insights like this to help us get to know the killer and I think this is important for a film focusing on a serial killer and is one reason why Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is so effective. However, the music was well done and unsettling, although sometimes the tapes could've been creepier without the music because it takes the realism away. Also, sometimes it was impossible to see what was going on thanks to the wobbly, washed-out image.So all in all, it was an OK experience. I wasn't exactly bored, but it definitely needed more padding out. The directors' clearly have a lot of potential because they can craft some truly terrifying sequences, there just aren't really enough of them. There needs to be more to a film other than it just being scary, otherwise it just turns out dull, even though it did do scary very well. I liked how it was able to get under your skin and not rely on jump scares. It also surprisingly, didn't have much blood and gore, which I find impressive. I'd like to see a European or Asian remake (even though that would never happen) because I think that the film would be more focused if it was put into the hands of say, Kôji Shiraishi who directed the wonderful mockumentary, Noroi: The Curse which is just as scary as this film (probably even scarier) but also much better made. However, Poughkeepsie is a film that I would recommend, especially if you want a good scare.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
25,phenomynouss,uneven tone and uneven quality,6,28 February 2021,"For some reason I was fully expecting this to be brutal and particularly violent and traumatic and as such just instinctively avoided it for a while. But boredom got the better of me and I went and watched it. Thankfully it is not as overly gorey or gruesome as I expected, instead relying a lot on extreme discomfort and the implications of torture without actually seeing much of the actual torture.
The story is one of cops in Poughkeepsie New York finding a huge stash of VCR tapes during a raid on a serial killer's house, and there's literally thousands of tapes chronicling the killer kidnapping and killing people. It all unfolds in a documentary style which serves very well as a framing device.
But right away the film starts to quake a bit. Some of the actors portraying FBI agents or specialists look badly out of place or way too young, some of the actors add in unrealistic comments that are supposedly meant to show just how extreme this killer is/was.
The uneven quality of the acting starts to cause some of these scenes to be literally laughable, as an FBI specialist, in his most overly dramatic ""barely holding it together voice"" tells us that his wife accidentally watched 30 minutes of a tape and wouldn't let him touch her for over a year. Even remembering it now just made me laugh out loud not because of how it sounds, but just the absurdly serious way it was delivered.
Other events that are supposed to be serious, including even clips from the tapes themselves, filmed by the killer, sometimes struggle to maintain a balance between the theatrical/macabre and the absurd, in particular whenever the killer is shown dressed in his Plague Doctor costume. No matter how brutal or disturbing the content on screen is, the ridiculous theatricality just makes me laugh.
Some of the content matter actually fares better as a result of this unintentional comedy; without the absurd image of the killer walking on all fours with a mask on the back of his head, it would be much more difficult to take in the more brutal and sadistic things he does.
But at the same time, some of these ""unintentional comedy"" moments aren't a naturally flowing element to leaven a horrible moment. A lot of the police and witness interviews just try too hard to come across as ""Serious true crime Netflix presents AmazonPrime documentary"" and it comes across as almost wacky as a result.
The way the killer is repeatedly described as being an almost Mary Sue-ish caliber of serial killer, able to always outsmart the cops at every turn, always have everything pre-planned to perfection, described in such a way like if the killer was a Sith Lord, he would be ""more powerful than Darth Vader and the Emperor and Darth Maul put together on steroids baaaa""
Some of the unexpected best parts of the film are when it touches upon Cheryl Dempsey, the longest-running victim of the killer, that it could almost become the story of her alone, her experiences and how it permanently damaged her as a person. But most of the film is spent fixating on the serial killer like he was a living Terminator, an absolute unstoppable genius that would make Hannibal Lecter look like a buffoon.
In fact it spends so much time hyping up the killer that I ended up spending more time laughing at the film than being disturbed or grossed out by it.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
26,PedroPires90,"Good, but had potential to be a classic",6,7 May 2021,"It's a very different and interesting approach, even if it gets a bit boring, repetitive and predictable.Some parts are disturbing but not THAT disturbing for people really into horror, who watch a lot of films from any decade, from any country if the world. The acting is good and that makes the experience worth enough and I really liked the editing.However, I felt that, as a movie, this idea and this story should have resulted in something unique and memorable. It isn't. Intriguing enough, good enough, but it's not even the 1st or 2nd best film of the director.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
27,Shattered_Wake,Not nearly as shocking as it thinks it is,3,9 January 2009,"After a massive collection of tapes containing video of the torture & murder of hundreds of innocent men & women is found in an abandoned house, an investigation forms to discover who is responsible for the decade-long terror put upon the town of Poughkeepsie.After being pushed back more than a Detroit Lions offensive lineman, 'The Poughkeepsie Tapes' finally saw the light of day here in early 2009. Rumours and news swarmed around this film since its announcement. When trailers were released, arguments and debates (stupidly) broke out on the validity of the tapes. Let it be clear: None of it is real. It may be based on something real, but these are not real tapes (which is quite obvious while watching). But, that doesn't mean it can't still be good, right? Well, while that is true. . . there are more than a few other reasons why this wasn't good. At all. I think, of the technical aspects, one of the major flaws of the film is the acting. Just about every actor in this film is just plain painful to watch. I don't think I actually saw a single believable character in the film, especially the FBI agents. If I ever met an FBI agent that acted like some of these people, I would greatly fear for the security of our nation even more than I already do. In addition to that, what FBI agents would actually do a film like this? Not the film we're watching, clearly, but what the film represents: The documentary. For a fairly recent serial killer of this magnitude, the majority of this information would be kept locked away from the general public for a long while. Obviously that would ruin the 'effect' of the film, but the lack of realism was really damaging to a film trying to be as real as possible. Also, I had a major problem with both the cinematography and the film quality of the tapes. I mean, this killer is quite clearly invested in his 'work.' The profiler states that he thinks the killer did this as a way to enjoy the murders long after they ended, that he was very meticulous about the filming. . . yet, the majority of these tapes are grainy and choppy and low quality? Why? Why wouldn't he have good film/video? Even a basic $300 video camera will deliver reasonable quality (at least it would have a night vision function, which clearly his camera did not). I get that it was a way of differentiating between the tapes and the other parts of the documentary, but I think a viewer is smart enough to realize that when a woman is in her underwear bouncing on a balloon (seriously), it's not going to be one of the FBI agents. As far as the content of the tapes, I wasn't very impressed. They weren't overly shocking or gruesome, barring a couple examples. They weren't well done or convincing. They didn't scare me. The majority of them were just laughably bad, like a 'Scary Movie' spoof of the 'August Underground' movies (which, in themselves, are laughably bad enough as it is). But, I suppose that's what it kind of is. Not a spoof, really, just what seems like a more tame, more mainstream attempt at an 'August Underground'-type film. . . but, really, it's just bad.Final Verdict: 3.5/10-AP3-",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
28,timothygartin,Overly Melodramatic,5,28 October 2021,I liked this movie and a lot of it worked well. The big issue I had is that the killer is too theatrical and the videos that are supposed to be found footage are too overacted and polished. Nothing feels real in a movie that needs a sense of reality in order to work.,The Poughkeepsie Tapes
29,ritera1,A genius idea in format for a very well-worn genre,8,2 February 2021,"Must have been extremely cheap to make, too, as I read it was shot only in 15 days. Did indulge visual sadism, which personally I could have done without.There is a subgenre of horror like this that is made extremely cheap and is extremely graphic. On the fringes of the movie business. Clearly there are movies that fall into the debatable areas of free speech. Ones like this put two toes into the water and some put the whole foot.The history of this asks questions as the director had a good slate of mainstream films subsequent to this. He turned out to be a good horror action director. But then I read that it didn't have a release until 8 years after completion. I'd guess word got around about it which launched the director's mainstream career shortly after this was completed. Sounds like a movie in itself.Felt the huge creative failing was the assumed degradation of the POV VHS tapes. Grainy and fluctuated between colors in the same fashion, clearing up at specific points when the victims were on screen. Changed from the original source material. In the end found it extremely annoying. Unchanged VHS clearly has a far better look of starkness to it. Maybe too much for a movie like this. Wonder if that's why it was manipulated.Clear for a chunk of it that they were shooting and cutting around the violence. Some moments were way too graphic and indulged in insanity.The acting struck me as very melodramatic but don't think it was necessarily a failing. Many worked quite well. Not traditional movie actor looks. The killer himself was way over the top and relied on yelling far too much. Maybe a bad director's choice.The format was very clear. Interviews, crime scene photos, stock footage and the killer's tapes. When the Girl Scouts appeared, it broke from such as the 2 girls didn't acknowledge the camera, although it was shot like that.I figured out much later that it took place in the '90s, but nothing was done to underscore that point early on.When the killer ""hid"" the camera in Cheryl's bedroom, was not likely vs it being the '90s and the cameras were very large. A smaller Hi8 tape was in Cheryl's grave near the end (for some reason) but that didn't explain why the tapes found were VHS.And clarification on the passage of time was ignored. Simple inserts would have been much better.The SWAT raid looked very weak. Not even a sound effect of a helicopter or background noise of police cars. I know this was likely an extremely low budget, but it was obvious.The Cheryl element, established early on as a huge portion of the tapes, was sporadic until much later. Interesting element after she was found to have her addicted to pain as that was her life for years.The brief Cheryl interview near the end was very effective.Clearly an exploitation movie, although made fairly well with a creative approach. But the chances that such tapes (that included two murders) or crime scene photos being released, much less wrapped into an actual documentary, would be impossible. No chance.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
30,Cedric_Catsuits,Sleep inducing drivel,1,12 August 2013,"I admit I gave up on this half way through, but nothing I saw led me to believe it was about to get any better. The use of the 'tapes' may have been for 'realism' but they are so poor in quality it makes much of the film unwatchable.This is supposed to be a horror film? Certainly there was nothing horrific in the first half. Films with such low production values need to pile on the blood and gore or spine-tingling thrills to get any sort of reaction, but this is just mildly unpleasant and utterly pointless.I guess it's just another bunch of clueless amateurs jumping on the budget horror bandwagon, and failing miserably. How this averages a 6 is beyond me - there must be a lot of people with low expectations who don't watch many movies, because if they did have something to compare this with they would see how dreadful it is.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

Now,when I heard about this,I was like,ugh,just show me the damn movie and then I saw the tapes..I HAD TO TURN IT OFF!! The Poughkeepsie Tapes,is actually to me a bit sad,this dude,I don't know his name but he directed As Above So Below,had to use disturbing video tapes,that I actually don't even know are fake,I heard rumor's about these tapes being real,to make a brilliant banned horror film,what about trying your best then gathering a whole bunch of crappy actors and going 'let's make this really violent,torturous movie with really deranged murder tapes..but otherwise,let's talk about the good things,well,this film was so creepy and disturbing then anything! The guy who played this guy was so messed up and creepy,shivers ran through my back like all the time,I am not going to spoil but what this guy did was so deranged and scary and especially where it was all set.

The documentary style aspect of the film was very entertaining in learning bits about the killer himself and how he disappeared and how the tapes were found, and then there were the tapes..crickey.

34,deadbull-95171,For Stockholm Syndrome fans,6,4 January 2021,"If you have been a true crime buff for decades, have read all the books and abstracts by ""FBI profilers"", seen all the authentic documentaries with real killers,
know about Sylvia Likens and Gertrude, the ""girl in the box"" what went down at Unit 731, have read the transcripts and actually heard the tapes of ""Pliers"" Bittaker ripping apart his victims, not easy to come by and drove law enforcement people and courtroom personnel from the room because they were so unbearable.....(Shirley Ledford )a real record keeper he, and on and on.....then you will see the myriad discrepancies in this movie trying so hard to be P.O.V. and real.
Remember when Henry, portrait of a serial Killer was considered the bottom line of ""real"" film making. Frankly compared to this, it WAS. Looky....mainstream real snuff has been leaked, and not on the ridiculous ""Dark Web"" either....Look for the leaked footage of the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs if you want to see eyes gouged out with screwdrivers etc. or perhaps the authentic footage referred to in Don't f..k with Cats......surprisingly available on a server around Jerusalem.......Apparently a lot of contemporary psychopaths, if you want to use that term to describe people who like to kill sadistically, have really embraced the digital age and in fact do create media memoirs of their adventures in other people's agonies.
I saw the title of the first comment and didn't even read the rest of it , no insult intended, I rarely read ""news"" articles either, the headline is usually enough. because I agree. Th entire movie, like the Sylvia Likens story , could have been streamlined nd empowered by focus on this fictional case alone. That headline inspired me to type this because I think it's perceptive.
The filmmaker has obviously read about ""disorganized/organized profiling to cook up his ""mixed"" profile that is the complicated by even that being a cover for this ""super-killer""
All in all, if you are sort of new to the game, this is original enough to hold interest. Had it focused on the ""Cheryl"" incident, it might have become truly disturbing, as some details presented there, how long term abuse victims do in fact become deeply attached to their torturers, and the extremity of physical and mental stuff they endure, and on rare occasions survive, could have made this not so much ""scarey, but something more profound, deeply sickening, by creating heavy empathy for the victim as there suffering progresses. there are too many points of view here......too much fancy footwork, should have gone victim P.O.V. almost all the way, one victim, over time, and pretty much leave the tragic ending intact.

36,Ziglet_mir,Great Horror paying homage to The Blair Witch,8,8 March 2020,"A tightly paced mocumentary style, Blair Witch Project tribute that focuses on a ""real"" serial killer-rapist known as the ""Water Street Butcher"".With beautiful shots of the western and eastern banks of the Hudson River and the Poughkeepsie area, the film shows us the dark underbelly of the town through the interviews of FBI agents, detectives, physicians and family members of victims interlocking these moments with footage of the actual kidnappings and killings the butcher took himself.There are some legitimately terrifying moments here, some harken my mind to Lynch and others to the clear inspiration this received from The Blair Witch Project. Moments with the handheld camera are blocked brilliantly and there is good suspense that builds in several of the killing sequences. One scene, in particular, with the use of walking on all fours and a mask is executed excellently.As far as performances go, believe it or not, I was most fascinated with two of the interviewees who I think did an incredible job, Ivar Brogger and Lou George. The former perhaps doing the beat straight FBI interviews I've ever seen and the latter summoning the likeness and professionalism of Albert Rosenfeld in Twin Peaks.

37,FilmFatale,"Mixed Bag But Effective, If You Let It Be",6,15 March 2014,"Like many people have mentioned before me, I remember seeing this trailer before some major release and being shocked that it was being released to the general public like that. I had been following it a bit on some of the horror websites and was intrigued; I suppose that's why I hadn't forgotten it after all these years. I had some time to kill today and decided to watch it and I was rather pleasantly surprised by it.Not to say that The Poughkeepsie Tapes is ""entertaining"" - it's obviously a dark and unpleasant movie, and its structure means that we have no clear resolutions or ""victim turning the tables"" moment of catharsis to give the audience something to cheer for or even a deep understanding of killer and victims because we've only got those snippets of the tapes from which we get our information. Parts were also incredibly frustrating, especially if you like your stories to have a beginning, a middle, and an end.What worked for me was how there were some very clever parts and the killer was interesting even without the audience getting to really know him or see him. You had to be quiet and follow along with all of the tapes and the talking heads in the interviews or you'd miss some things, and I liked the way I wasn't beaten over the head with plot points. Plus, the scene with the killer entering the room with the ""car trouble"" lady was one hell of a disturbing image.

40,FrightMeter,"Certainly not perfect, but effective nonetheless.",8,20 January 2009,"""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" is a tough film to review. Much like any recent horror film, there are going to be people who love it and people who hate. Reading some of the recent reviews here and on other prominent horror sites, one would think this film is as sloppy and as terrible as ""Ax 'Em"" or ""Dark Fields."" In fact, though this film has a plethora of problems, I believe it is an effective, creepy, and thought-provoking little film.It is presented as a documentary. Basically, a serial killer has been terrorizing the community of Poughkeepsie, New York for years. Cops are baffled by the cleverness of the killer. He is even able to frame a police officer, who is executed for the crimes. When they discover the home of the serial killer, police and FBI find hundreds of VHS tapes, each detailing the crimes of this vicious killer. We are shown footage of these tapes, interwoven with interviews of police officers, family members of victims, and even a victim herself to get a perspective of the killer and his crimes. Some of the footage is downright creepy and disturbing, including the murder of a young child and torture of several victims. The mask the killer wears is also quite creepy.One of the main problems with the film is in presentation. We are suppose to be viewing ""real"" footage of the killer and his crimes, but can't help to notice the convenient ""suspenseful"" background music that plays during each clip. Did the killer go in and edit and add music to each of his tapes? The killer's identity remains a mystery throughout the whole film and it is a stretch to ask viewers to believe the he was able to get away with some of the stuff he did (framing a police officer). The acting by some is rather hokey, but I can't decide if it was meant to be that way because is is suppose to be ""real"" people being interviewed, or if these people are just bad actors.Despite the flaws, ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" does some things extremely well, mainly making the viewer uncomfortable. The killer is pretty brazen, and it is horrifying to think that, yes, there ARE people out there like that. Like the film says, there are anywhere from 25-40 active serial killers working at any given time in the United States. The black and white footage of the ""crimes"" is pretty effective and provides some great tension. There is also one scene where the killer is walking on all fours toward a victim with his creepy mask on that gave me chills. Though the ending is unsatisfying, it almost couldn't have ended any other way.Overall, I have seen MUCH worse. Those dismissing this as nothing but brainless torture porn obviously have short attention spans or just weren't paying all that close attention to it. The film is constructed and edited very well (despite the flaws I mentioned above) and the story is actually pretty solid. I can tell a lot of thought went into this film. It could have been better, but that can be said about any film. Go in with an open mind and watch this with the lights off at night.

Absolutely among the worst movies I have ever watched.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

You actually feel disturb in some scenes specially the ones with kids. As the FAQs says they made a lot or research on actual serial killers and their bizarre behavior with the victims, it's very shocking.I don't understand why this movie is so ""hidden"" it's one of the few found footage (some of it) that's feels accurate to why it's tape the way it is. With a few plot holes involving a suspect,this movie is very gripping and shocking. I say give it a watch",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
43,andell,Got Through Half...and that was enough!,1,6 January 2009,"The Poughkeepsie Tapes is a faux documentary that is not based on a specific case itself, but rather on a series of real cases which are alleged to have ""inspired"" the purveyors of this trash! And yes, I realize that this film will almost certainly attract a core of cultish fans, but inevitably it is trash.For those not in the know, the Poughkeepsie Tapes is about a killer nicknamed the ""Water Street Butcher,"" who was never caught and left a gruesome compilation of video tapes in which he approaches, stalks, chats up, attacks, murders and then in some cases, even dismembers and disposes of his victims.As cliché as can be, his victims are almost exclusively female, and range in age from children up to adults: however there is nothing even remotely new here. ""Buffalo Bill"" in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" carved tailored patterns out of the flesh of his victims; the best the ""Water Street Butcher"" can offer us is a jittery, poorly lit compilation of torture porn scenes which ""incriminate"" him, but which do not actually lead us towards a conclusion that makes the torment of watching this all the less rewarding! I'll be the first to admit that I didn't make it to the end of the film. Not because I was frightened, but rather because I had reached the level of tolerance with the film, and simply was no longer interested in sitting through this movie any further! At some point, there has to be more to make these films worthy of their audience besides saturating us with images of dead bodies having heads sawed off and women being tortured and murdered! The gore fiends will almost certainly flock to that materials, but most of us are more discerning and aren't really inclined to invest in so unpleasant a movie going (or video) experience.I don't recommend this film, not even as a rental!",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

Although it does not work at the documentary level, due to the low credibility of the interpretations, it does work in the representation of the supposedly found recordings. This distortion of the images, although it is a stylistic signature that goes beyond the imitation of reality to create its own, almost experimental language, builds some of the most discomforting moments in recent horror cinema.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
46,GethinVanH,Tries to hard to be shocking,2,20 June 2009,"The Ploughkeepsie Tapes is an absolutely awful movie. It's not even a movie, I would call it a slaughter/torture porn film for people to watch in groups during sleepovers to scare each other. This movie is written by people with the minds of teenagers, for people with the minds of teenagers.There's very little purpose for the movie other than to utterly horrify the viewer with gruesome details of a fake serial killer. At one point the police go into extreme detail about the intestines of a victim being ripped out and ""laying on the floor like Christmas lights"". There's absolutely no realism. I didn't believe for a second that it was anything but a mockumentary. The acting and writing were atrocious.It's pretty much Blair Witch Project meets Saw. It's the mockumentary style which has been done many, many times. It's been done a lot better in Blair Witch, Cloverfield, and dare I say, Diary of the Dead.And unlike Saw and Blair Witch, there are no characters to root for, all the viewer gets is screaming victims, who are introduced, murdered or survive and get tortured.This film is pretty much the equivalent to a sucker punch to the balls. You know those youtube videos where nothing is happening and then someone pops up and screams very loudly? That's what this movie is. I'm not sure who enjoyed this movie?

47,umimelectric,Disturbing for mom but nothing a modern horror fan can't watch,5,14 October 2017,"I decided to give this a viewing after reading how disturbing it's supposed to be and that it was never given its cinematic or home releases that were intended for it.Some imagery and themes are unsettling, particularly those involving the younger victims. If you are very bothered by the implication of children being harmed then you should probably watch something else but I find real life is much scarier than fiction.It's loosely based off of an actual serial killer in that city in the 90's though it's really a work of fiction as most if not all of the events in the film do not reflect reality. Found footage genre so some people will treat it like they are viewing real events anyway.The acting is so mediocre that the best I can do is a 5/10. Acting is not this challenging...and even worse it's not challenging for someone to notice poor acting so it's a mystery why it's allowed in so many indie films as if a director can't notice it, yet I can without a problem.In the case of found footage, it would seem acting should be relatively simple...but the ""FBI agents"" that are interviewed on camera just seem like loser actors hamming it up, right down to the hesitant breaths they take before speaking, and the dramatic facial expressions. Watch some true crime stuff on TV where they speak to real FBI agents...they are completely calm and collected, factual and to the point. These FBI agents in the film come off as actors who want to be noticed by exaggerating their parts and making their lines seem more poignant than that of how your typical dull federal agents would express themselves on camera, a place where they are not naturally comfortable being.All in all, if you want some torture porn, this movie may suffice.

Right away acting was flat but I forgave it because it fits the idea of a documentary where these are real people not actors, but then when you get to the ""real acting"" everything is so over the top and almost silly it is even worse. This so-called genius killer doesn't display any behavior that shows he thoroughly planned anything at all and did not even stick to a specific MO. If anything he is a bizarre mix of the Joker level of loud villainy plus someone pretending to be a normal guy with really shoddy camera work. I have seen a lot of true crime shows and read about infamous killers and I can say reality far surpasses this garbage.

The ""actors"" (I'm being generous) cleared that up for me very quickly.
The ""experts"", the victims - all wooden and impossible to believe. Terrible, terrible acting.Also, a lot of COME ON, NOBODY SEES HIM?Then, torture and horror.

50,azeemnavarro,This could've been so much better,4,26 July 2019,"This mockumentary tries to recreate the feel of the crime shows that you can find on the Discovery Channel, and it kinda achieves it. The Poughkeepsie Tapes is about the hundreds and hundreds of films the NY cops discover in the house of a serial killer. This movie alternates between the cops and investigators telling the story of the decades long career of this murderer, and the footage that it is in the tapes that were found. Pretty good plot, isn't it?
In paper, this movie should be great, in fact, when I first saw it I loved it, I gave it a 9/10. But after a rewatch, the flaws were so many, that I don't know how I didn't noticed them the first time.
The major problem in this movie has to be the acting. Most of the actors that play the detectives do a mediocre to bad job, only one or two are believable. The main victim, the one that ""survived"" is actually great, but just that one. The worst actor in here, is by a long shot the killer. Everytime he speaks in the movie is like you're seeing a mad and edgy 12 year old. He's so unintimidating that I just laugh when he says something. Yeah he has some moments were he's good, but that doesn't compensate his terrible acting.
The fact that this movie was never formally released hurts a lot the technical quality of the film. I have only seen a vod version, and the video and audio are just bad. I hope this will get a proper release someday, maybe that day this movie will be a little bit better.
Talking about bad quality, why the films of the killer had to be this sh1tty? They put this distortion effects and white noise to them, that is an artistic decision (?) that I don't understand, because you can't see or hear what's even happening. Even then, that's doesn't mean much if you consider that most of the found footage is laughtable (omg that balloon one) , because of the bad acting I mentioned before. There's just one scene that's truly creppy, that's the one that everyone knows where you get a close up of one victim, and the killer is in the back, crawling towards her in that weird costume, in a strange and animalistic way, and finally killing her in a gruesome way. That scene is simply amazing.
One thing that really bugs you, is how they present the killer, as this intelligent and one of a kind criminal, one that breaks all the rules, and that's why they never caugh him. But when you see how this dude operates... comon, that guy is really stupid. Abducting a girl in the daylight in front of her house, stalking a girl for hours without taking any precautions, letting girls in your house expecting that they will not notice the freaking tied up girl that is under your table. That is how a mastermind killer behaves? I guess he just felt lucky.
I'm sure that with a bigger budget, a different cast, and more experience from part of the director, this movie would've been great. I give this a 4 because of the premise and trying to do something new. See it if you need a quick watch.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
51,jmerlino,Interesting found footage flick.,6,24 September 2020,"The ""found footage"" format always works better (I think) when it's presented in pseudo-documentary form like it is here.The only problem with this movie is that it's hard to believe a serial killer could be THAT clever, going so far as to engage in a multi-year project to frame a police officer. That just wasn't believable.I know the ""brilliant serial killer"" thing is one of those horror movie tropes that we just have to deal with because they make for better stories, but most serial killers are of average or below average intelligence (or so I have read),",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

Ignoring the unbelievably tame tapes themselves (I don't really find ""gore"" scary when it's overdone), the fact that the killer goes around recording everything, even at his own crime-scene with cops around, would get him caught REALLY fast. The killer is basically like one of those attention-seekers who keep recording themselves and posting it on Twitter and Instagram for the world to see. And what exactly was he recording on? That camera's battery lasts longer than most cameras these days.I got hyped up with people recommending this movie, and it's a dud with a LOT of ""logic"" (it is trying to present itself as a documentary) issues that can't even be ignored cause of ""suspension of disbelief"".

That to me is the realistic core of the horror of this film.On the surface this is initially quite a normal low budget 'fake documentary' style film. You may even be a little bored for a while.The genius stroke is how this film somehow drags you in and makes you care about the victims (especially one), even while the law enforcement officials drone on ineffectively and you scoff at the whole thing to start with. .I won't spoil it, but this film is essentially a fake 'documentary' about a serial killer. What really makes it stand out is the attention paid to the victims. It has the horror of Henry:Portrait or Confessions of a Serial Killer but much more.This really stuck in my head - in a bad way!

59,BloedEnMelk,"Quite effective, but could have been better.",7,27 March 2011,"I'm somewhere between a 6,5 and 7,5 if it comes to rating this movie, so I'll keep it on a 7. It is creepy and effective, but I think more could have been done with it to make it come above average. The story of this movie is a simple one. In the house of a serial killer there are a lot of tapes found. On those tapes are the abductions, torture and murders of his victims. The Poughkeepsie Tapes is about this found footage, and in between the footage we see interviews with all kinds of people. FBI, students, parents, friends, and a surviving victim. A few things that annoyed me were the background music and the quality of the 'found footage'. If you are a serial killer, and you want to videotape everything you do, then why do it on such a low-quality camera? IMO it would be a lot more realistic if the 'found footage' quality was a lot better. And, found footage doesn't come with sound effects or a sound track. An other annoying thing was the surviving victim. It made me think of a real girl who was abducted by nutcase Cameron Hooker in 1977 and been hold captive for 7 years, spending a lot of that time in a box. It is also reminding of an equally sick nutter called Gary Heidnik who kept (and killed) girls as slaves in his cellar. But though the surviving victims were obviously extremely traumatized for life, the Stockholm Syndrome of the girl in the Poughkeepsie Tapes is totally over the top. Which makes it more unbelievable. Speaking about unbelievable, what about the time he spends hidden in the girls room, with the camera still going? Does he have an everlasting tape?The good thing though is that there are some very unsettling parts in this movie, and overall it does feel pretty realistic. One thing I liked for example was that the normal voice of the killer was indeed very next-door guy, which is a good contrast for those moments where he is a total sick bastard. There were some moments I could feel my hair standing up.I can imagine that for people who are not used to disturbing movies, this one is very disturbing. But if you are pretty thick-skinned like me and you watch a lot of movies, then you might be disappointed. Still, I did enjoy it, it could have been a lot worse, but then again it could also have been better.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
60,DexX,A skeleton of interesting ideas destroyed by shoddy execution,2,23 April 2015,"Oh dear. I had been told this was an amazingly disturbing film, genuinely horrific, a must-see for fans of the genre. There was so much hype that I just had to see it.Oh dear.There is a kernel of a good idea here: a serial killer so meticulous that he changes his MO periodically to throw investigators off his scent. The sub-story of ""murder by bureaucracy"" is also a creepy concept, worthy of a whole film in its own right - a cop framed by a serial killer to take the fall for his murders, and revealed to be innocent only days after his execution? That's a great idea, but it's wasted in this film.Sadly, these interesting ideas are destroyed utterly by a laughably bad script, idiotic attempts at police procedure, and universally appalling acting. Not a single performance in this entire film is convincing. Every single person who appears on screen or is heard in voice-over sounds like exactly what they are: bad actors reading a bad script.For those seeking a dumb, trashy thrill, it doesn't even satisfy on that level: a handful of reasonably effective scenes of psychological horror are padded out by interminable periods of hilariously bad actors trying and failing to sound like cops and FBI agents.This is a bad mockumentary, a bad horror film, and a bad thriller.

Horror is my favorite genre, but it very rarely scares me anymore. This one did. It's hard to watch and it sticks with you.

Okay so some of the acting is a bit rubbish. I maybe recognised two or three people from other things. All in all, it is a credible documentary style offering although, what passes for 'real life' acting is a little above theatrical ham for a few of the cast.No matter, this is a genuinely creepy film. You have to keep reminding yourself that it is only a movie as some of the scenes are quite realistic thanks in part to the shaky hand-held camera footage and what your brain 'fills in' off camera. It's 'mock snuff' but well done 'mock snuff'.The subject matter is disturbing as the age range of the victims is broad.Claimed as the first part of a trilogy, I would definitely want to catch the follow ups but only if they were of the same gritty quality and the acting (for a few) was more realistic. The documentary 'experts' were filmed particularly well.A lot of thought, time and effort has gone into the making of this movie and you will be rewarded if you watch it all the way through.One of the most disturbing images is of one of the victims, late on in the movie. You might be left 'scratching your head' wondering how they did that.If you think it will be like Scream or Evil Dead, you will not be happy. It's more of a 'FBI Files' or 'Real CSI' type of movie.I would say that a bigger budget would allow for some ultra-realistic prosthetic body parts to push the scare-o-meter to the limits.Be afraid but keep telling yourself, ""It's only a movie!""

67,aequanimis,More Like a High School Film Project,3,11 May 2020,"The Poughkeepsie Tapes is an interesting take on the ""found footage"" genre, which presents itself as more of an analysis of a serial killer's tapes and his bloody tirade that takes place over the course of decades. It has more of a documentary-style and tries very hard to play as a legitimate, real-life production. The style is interesting, but I found that I just couldn't take The Poughkeepsie Tapes seriously.Firstly, and most importantly, the actors were are all terrible. Throughout the film, we occasionally see snippets of characters who can be put into two categories: people with personal experiences with the killer or the Tapes themselves and ""experts"" who offer insight into the killer's mindset, who he might be, and who break down the elements of the Tapes. Each of the so-called ""experts"" felt like the writers of this movie took all the ""forensic-agent-detective-doctor"" stereotypes they could think of and all of the key catchphrases this archetype tends to utter and mashed it all up and tried to spread it out onto each of these characters. There was even the token Asian doctor who just HAD to have the broken English and thick accent, because Asian doctors tend to have that, right? These characters felt like they were barely able to deliver their lines, much less actually be believable, reliable figures within the film's universe. The other category of characters in the film were even less believable. The most notable example is Cheryl Dempsey's actress. Her attempt to appear as a damaged, meek victim of horrific abuse and untold horrors only came off as if she was just a shy, two-dimensional cardboard cutout. They likely told her, ""Pretend like you have no will of your own,"" and she sure did, but in the worst way possible.Secondly, it's hard to take this movie seriously when the so-called genius serial killer, who is made out to be an amalgamation of Ted Bundy, Ed Gein, John Wayne Gacy, and all the terrible killers ever imagined, except he has the brain power of Albert Einstein, comes off as the sloppiest, doofiest human to ever walk this Earth. He's apparently so elusive, so smart that the investigators can't even properly profile him, because... that's how elusive and smart he is. Except... he abducts little girls in broad daylight, compromises his identity by directly and publicly confronting the mother of his hostage, likes to spontaneously kidnap people like Girl Scouts who are likely being expected by their parents and live near him, and makes no effort whatsoever to even wear gloves or clean up his crime scenes a little bit? Is that the super genius I'm supposed to believe evaded custody and came up with an elaborate scheme to frame another man using his donated sperm?There were other aspects of this film that felt cumbersome, but I could ignore. There were some ill-fitting music choices that really took away the gravity of the content being shown on-screen. There are two major flaws to this movie that killed it for me and made it feel like someone's film class project. But I don't think it's impossible to enjoy this film. It's definitely interesting, and I'd like to see more films take a similar approach to this genre of film.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
68,jnelso19,OK Dowdle Brothers You Win,8,6 January 2013,"Since the beginning of their film careers, the Dowdle Brothers (Or the Brothers Dowdle, whichever way works for you) seem dedicated to scaring the crap out of people. Granted you can do that with an unexpected nude scene, but it can also be done by making a film out of everyone's comfort zone. They followed the latter and they did it with much success despite the film not seeing any theater time except at a couple of festivals. Now they story of this film goes deeper then the film itself so like every story, we'll start from the beginning.With The Poughkeepsie Tapes, the Dowdle's decided to go all out with what many could consider a more intense ID Channel special. (Since the spoilers button was pressed might as well use it) It shows some looney bin deciding to kill a crap ton of people with a true lack of prejudice, ranging from children to a couple nice enough to help someone out. What makes it better or disturbing, he films all the murders in one way or another. Now this guy follows all the basic traits of a serial killer, except he has a combination of smarts that mixes well with his insanity. He knows he's being watched, he knows he's being tracked, yet he also knows how not to get caught and how to get what he wants at the same time. Of course with this killer you have to have the FBI following his every trail. This however is where the film falls apart. The FBI people despite their full knowledge of how this guy works, can't even get a glimpse of the guy, even though he shows up to a crime scene of his and taunts one of his victim's family members (For real, how in the hell was he able to leave the scene without being talked to. But we'll let that one slide). The other great part of the killers madness is that he got a police officer killed using our set of rules regarding justice and he used it in ways that no one should be allowed to find out. Yet the paper trail remains and the FBI is so stunned to even follow it. (Spoiler: He used semen from a donor bank to implicate an innocent man, now not knowing how one acquires semen. I'm confident that he would have to sign for something just to show he isn't bottling it up for mass distribution. With that he would have to show ID, and at worst give some more background info. The Dowdle's fail to observe the FBI even looking into it. Something that I would've looked into the instant that kind of info came to mind. The things that some people miss). Despite that major flaw, the film still creeps the hell out of people myself included. It never shows the killers face, scary point 1. The killer sounds normal scary point 2. The killer changed MO's as much as we change Facebook profiles so you never know who he's going to kill, scary point 3. The Dowdle's did their job as filmmakers to get people to always look behind and to not trust anyone.Now the legend regarding the tapes of course is that it was acquired by the Suge Knight of film companies MGM and for some reason was never released. Now everyone is up at arms regarding this decision but despite my firm belief in the 1st Amendment, this one deserves to be found in rare places (found this on Youtube whoever is interested). Why, much like Fight Club where you don't want to have crazy people getting recipes to kill, you don't want this film to be watched by the wrong person. As to say the least is a How To Guide on how to get away with serial killing and getting it all on tape. Even though MGM never commented on the sudden shutdown, it appears other people seemed to agree that it was too much for the American public. Which in this day and age where shootings are more common then divorce, it's a good thing that it was keep in the dark. Saying that, if this film does get on screen, it should be supported and it'll still make noise for this reason. Despite the first person film perspective being overused, it's still a scary movie and that's rare in days where crappy horror franchises rule.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

The acting's on-par and the effects are nice. It's a good film to put on in the background while you're doing something else, which is more than I can say for a lot of flicks. Where this movie fails is its attempt to be taken seriously.Anyone with any type of training is going to know that the majority of the methodology is ridiculous. A serial killer doesn't go around targeting adults and children - even if they're after victims of opportunity. They have a type, may once or twice go against it due to an outside interruption, but that's it. And those that they do go after because it was either kill them or be caught, those are their most disorganized.It's apparent the filmmakers just wanted to put something together to make people uncomfortable. And if you have no experience in anything criminal-related, it might get to you. But even the torture that was described was pretty standard for even things you'd watch on regular television (Law & Order, Criminal Minds, NCIS, etc.).I give it 6/10 because it didn't bore me to tears, it just had me going ""that's not how that works"" way too often.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
70,danthepoetman,Not good,4,31 August 2019,"The acting is terrible throughout. The topic is horrific, and the found footage made-up creates a crude rendition of it. Yet, it's bad. It's boring. I almost stopped watching 3 or 4 times and had a lot of trouble going through the whole 80 minutes.
I hate the over sensitivity of today's culture. But I wonder if it's not rude for real families and victims of such crimes to mock-documentary them, to make a false documentary of fiction. That much at least, disturbed me a little.
But for the rest, I'm not sure why anyone would recomend that flick.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

72,Suicide_Saint,Found Footage at its Best,9,2 August 2014,"I was first introduced to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" at an early age and have been an avid horror fan ever since. 20+ years later, horror films are still a constant among my viewing habits. However, most films in the genre have become predictable, repetitive, and anything but what they are intended to be: scary. The found footage style is especially clichéd, which lowered my expectations for this movie further still. Needless to say, this film absolutely shattered all of these preconceived notions. ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" is an unrelenting, voyeuristic look into the world of a depraved and very successful serial killer using the ""hand cam"" and documentary style to an absurdly unsettling degree. The presentation, cinematography, acting, audio, costumes, pacing... essentially every portion of this film is chilling. This film never saw a cinematic release (despite a trailer displayed during ""The Mist"") and even more baffling, isn't available on DVD. This only adds to the mystique of the film, of course. The degree of realism is uncanny and was achieved without the pretentious ""based on a true story"" tagline. Without giving anything away, Stacy Chbosky gives an absolutely haunting performance as victim Cheryl Dempsey despite a small amount of screen time. In fact, everyone from the realtor at the beginning to the authority figures ""interviewed"" throughout the film are incredibly convincing. Not only is this a must-see for horror fans, this film is a testament to the fact that you do not need ""A-list"" actors, bloated budgets, or absurd amounts of computerized effects to make a compelling film. ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" is a frightening film experience and will, no doubt, leave a lasting impression on even the most seasoned horror movie veterans.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

I wouldn't even recommend it for a disturbing film I guess for some people it will be disturbing but if your looking for disturbing films there so much other films offering more than this. The story was ok I guess all interview sequences weren't good. One positive I think crawling needles to neck scene was fairly original and cool the most disturbing scene in the film aswell Id say.

There isn't much plot it's more about going through the different scary scenes of people getting tortured and killed.It's not too too bloody like the Saw movies I think are probably bloodier but this movie is so intense! It actually feels like you are watching serial killer footage which is scary.

77,omgakeem,A one star is generace!,1,21 November 2020,"I had never heard of this movie (if you want to call it a movie) read the description and thought it sounded interesting, boy was I wrong. From the first scene I knew it was not a real story, the actors were just so bad except for Stacy Chbosky as Cheryl, did they use friends and family for the parts. I could go on forever about how bad this is so I will just say BAD!!",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
78,Andrelamus,"Not Amazing, but Interesting and Creative",7,15 November 2018,"While the found footage is not new nor unique, we do get to see these parts from the killer's eyes which makes it refreshing. The deterioration and low quality effect which is added to the tapes significantly strengthen the feeling of dread while watching them; and while it may be annoying at times (usually with the rapid hue changes), it adds more than it detracts.The combination of the first two tapes (disregarding the balloon tape) set the tone for the brutality of the movie, starting with the kidnapping and subsequent torture of a child, the movie holds no punches. The movie adds an element of voyeurism which is heavily represented from the third tape onwards. The tape is a recording of a home invasion done by the killer. The scene makes the viewer feel like he is in the killer's shoes and not supposed to be in the house. The hiding and close calls only add to the tension and atmosphere of the scene until it ends with the inevitable death of the couple.
The reference to 9/11 in the interview following the officer's exoneration was a great detail which helped the movie feel a little more realistic. As if these events were really took place and had other real-life events influencing them. Although a predictable twist, I felt like it was a great one to help immerse the viewer in the movie and improve its believability.The interview and the end of the movie with the survivor was absolutely amazing. The actress was great and the scene had a wonderful feeling to it. It was a powerful ending, showing the lasting affects of the killer's torture on its victims. She was constantly asking what to say because she ""doesn't know what you (the interviewer) want me to say"" which reminded of the earlier torture scenes in the movie which revolved around total submission and erasure of self.While the movie had some great points which I've discussed, it did have some weak points. They are not detrimental to the movie, but they sure do hold it back from being a perfect one.The acting of Jason Ribling feels extremely out of place. While in a regular horror movie I would have write it off as comedic relief, in the documentary format is feels like bad acting. There were two more cases of of bad acting, or over-acting to be precise. The first was the with Pam Fears, especially before and after the scene mentioned above. It felt too dramatic and had too much emotion in it, instead of the cold posture usually presented in real crime documentaries. The second was the killer himself in some of the tapes; especially while shouting at his victims to ""say his name"" and walking on all fours in another. Those in particular didn't make me feel scared, but rather weirded out from his over-dramatic, almost theatrical behavior.For a documentary which felt like it cares for the little details, it felt weird it would perpetuate the 24 hour waiting period for reporting a missing person, especially in a case of child abduction with clear signs of violence. It definitely broke the immersion the movie tried to encompass the viewer in, presetting itself as a real documentary.For a killer who the police describe as extremely intelligent, organized and knowledgeable, he seems very disorganized and a risk-taker in his tapes. Again, if this was a regular film, I would count it as a sarcastic polarization between reality and what the police think, but since the interviews were done post-viewing the tapes I count it as a plot hole. The interviewees knew the killer 'lucked out' and got away with his risky decisions, yet they gave a current description of him as some form of mastermind. Moreover, the film stretches the levels of suspension of disbelief when it says the killer used a house for months as his base of operations without alerting anyone (the basement has no sound isolation as evident in the scene with the girl scouts) or leaving any identifying evidence.I'm not a great fan of open endings though in this particular instance, I feel it fits this movie quite well. We are left with a certainty that the killings continue to wherever the killer moved, yet the biggest question is left unanswered, who is the killer? Albeit agreeing that an open end suits the movie better, I would like to see this question explored and answered in extra material which expands upon the movie.Overall, I find The Poughkeepsie Tapes to be a good movie. There are a significant amount of good qualities in the movie which easily outweigh its weak points. A solid horror pseudo documentary, and a great entry to the found footage genre.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
79,mickeyshamrock,This movie has a lot more creative juice than I was expecting...,6,5 May 2008,"Based on the trailer for THE POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES I thought I was going to hate this movie  not because it looked disturbing but because it looked really lame. Truth is  it is a little lame, BUT the movie has a lot more creative juice than I was expecting and ultimately I found myself enjoying it. Similar to J.T. Petty's S&MAN or Remy Belvaux & Andre Bonzel's MAN BITES DOG, THE POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES is a pseudo documentary about a serial killer. While S&MAN and MAN BITES DOG are superior films, THE POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES excels due to its strict adherence to/understanding of the documentary format. Personally I didn't find the film as disturbing or horrific as I assume it was trying to be, however it did contain enough well thought out moments to convince me that the writer and director had done their horror homework (in particular a very William Castle ""esque"" sound bite/moment toward the film's finale). 2 little notes: the first 15 minutes are kind of slow so give the movie time AND I don't see this as a ""theater"" movie (I saw a DVD screener). THE POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES feels like a small screen movie. Have a few beers and toss it on during a late Saturday night or early Sunday morning.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
80,crooow-2,Bad script and acting kills any chance (pun intended),3,3 September 2014,"This fake documentary had promise. I didn't mind the grainy film shot by the killer. It masks most of the actual violence (which they have characters tell you about afterward). It got more graphic near the end and I didn't need/want to see that but what can you expect going into a movie like this? What made this almost unwatchable was the incredibly bad script and bad acting by the peripheral players. The killer and victims were believable. The police, parents, news reporters and FBI agents were not. In one interview an FBI agent says ""You know the funny thing about this?"" which was unbelievable from all angles (including the delivery). Another interview has an agent saying ""Maybe he thought I would admire him but I could never do that after what he did to Cheryl Dempsey"". Oh so you were thinking of possibly admiring him? A couple of the cops were believable but it was so distracting to have these completely ridiculous interviews interspersed with the actual investigation footage and the killer's tapes. I persevered to the end but I thought about turning it off many times. For people who said that made it more realistic, try watching actual interviews with police and FBI agents on IDTV.The other aspect was that the police work didn't hold together. They claim to have the killer on a gas station video covering his face and they also have the mother of a victim who saw him up close so they have a sketch and his car and yet they have zero clues. And the killer got enough sperm from a sperm bank from one police officer with a history of violence and no alibis who was near all the victims so that the killer could frame him? Ridiculous. I guess the sperm bank just gives out huge samples to random guys in their mid-20s with no documentation. And you can go in and request a specific person's sperm and keep it ""fresh"" enough to plant on multiple victims.The more I think about it, the stupider this whole movie is becoming.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

82,Tysoncarter,Deserves a much wider audience,6,9 June 2012,"The Poughkeepsie Tapes is filmed as a faux-documentary which recounts the story of the 'Water Street Butcher', a serial killer who terrorized a town called Poughkeepsie, NY for over ten years.I thought The Poughkeepsie Tapes was an above average horror film. We were shown a very methodical killer who very much enjoyed playing games with his victims.Gore wise most events happen off camera, but by far the most unsettling parts of the movie happen in the killers basement or dungeon. Here we see him tie up his victims, either to pipes or in different positions to get his point across he is in charge. The film primarily focuses on one victim in particular, a girl called Cheryl. After abducting her and imprisoning her in his basement, the killer seems to develop a special interest in Cheryl and becomes determined to keep her alive as his personal slave. In the beginning this involves just a few words, making her call him master for example. Eventually he takes this further to the extreme of introducing Cheryl to another victim in the dungeon and then he orders Cheryl to kill the new victim.SpoilersWe even see the killer re-visit Cheryl's home and meet her mother, which results in a traumatic revelation for her mother which I didn't quite buy into 100%. How did she know it was him?? A feeling?? I guess the point of the scene is too show just how twisted this guy is, as he took great delight in meeting the mother.I like the fact that Cheryl was found alive, albeit in a very bad way. Missing parts of her body and having suffered endless torture, seeing and listening to her interview at the end was so sad, it showed his methods had unfortunately worked and she could no longer live without him. Her suicide was the only way to end it really, it would have been no life for her to carry on as she was.The negatives are mainly about some of the acting. It is a low budget film, and does look like it due to the nature of the VHS quality of the found footage. The look of the film doesn't detract anything from it, but whilst some actors/actresses were great, Cheryl in particular, some of the cops for instance were a bit wooden. Also the use of a soundtrack in parts over the footage was strange, not sure the killer would have had time to add some mood music but again the good outweighed the bad. With a bigger budget and more studio support this really could have been a horror film that was widely seen and highly regarded in the genre, as it is it tends to divide opinion from the small minority that have seen it. A shame really as the idea and concept deserves much more.The film was originally released in 2007. When I say released I mean shown off at a few festivals where it received a good reception and great word of mouth and then was strangely pulled from all release schedules. Here we are in 2012 and there has still never been a cinema or DVD/blu ray release of the film. They even put a trailer out before a few other major releases but again it just slipped into oblivion. When I see the state of a lot of horror films in particular that get a big worldwide release and suck big time, it shocks me when a low budget but above average film is just left to rot on a shelf. People need to see this film. On the IMDb forums people still talk about this film regularly. 5 years on from its non-existent release and people have somehow managed to see it and still talk about it. Such a shame that this may never get the wider audience it deserves. At the very least it should be made available on DVD or on-demand video services. If you do get chance to see this, which whilst it may be tough is not impossible (some websites were offering it as a free to watch film if you sign up - that's how I found it) or through some miracle it gets a disk release I think you will be pleasantly surprised if you are into your horror films. I know for sure I have seen much worse and whilst it may not be the gore-fest that some people lust after, it has enough in my opinion to satisfy all horror fan needs.For more reviews please visit me at http://headinavice.wordpress.com/",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
83,Aka_Who,Could have been truly terrifying...,5,8 January 2009,This type of film is not new or unique however I have yet to see one with this level of detail and creativity put into it. Given a higher budget I think this could have possibly been a truly horrifying experience. As it stands however it is simply too flawed. The handi-cam footage is laughable when it is not annoyingly dark or shaky. The gore is disappointingly tame. The biggest flaw however lays within the acting. To pull off a film like this you must be careful to recruit actors talented enough to nail their part. Sadly too many of them miss their mark which all but kills the documentary feel the creators were going for. I would rate the story/idea a TEN but the execution and presentation a THREE or FOUR. ~PGDGM~,The Poughkeepsie Tapes
84,Taotrac,"Beautiful cinematography in select scenes, but leaves you wishing...",8,2 May 2010,"The Poughkeepsie Tapes is tragically good, meaning, there is something extremely special about this film delivered in very rare moments. For starters, it's a mockumentary about The Poughkeepsie Killer, a surprisingly intelligent serial killer who tapes everything he does and goes out of his way to make his killings look eerie and downright cinematic.First off, we're introducted to FBI and Morgue interviews, and it starts showing some clips of the serial killer's recordings, which get on your nerves at first glance not because they aren't creepy, but because the director of this film (this is a mockumentary, after all) applied way too much noise and static to the VHS clips to make it even look realistic. What was the killer supposed to be filming with, a 1901 crank film camera? Beyond this introduction though, you get over the clip's annoying quality, and the movie starts to make your jaw drop. The interviews quickly get boring, but the clips get extreme and downright (and you'll just have to see to believe) beautiful. The cinematography of the killer's tapes is downright awe-inspiring, and brings back a horror style not seen since the days of black and white film. Mardi Gra costumes, monster-esquire body movements...unrealistic horror beauty at it's finest, and the moment this starts happening, I started wishing the whole movie was just the tapes, and not any silly interviews. There are 'hundreds' of these 'tapes', that the police in the film found, and well, this film makes you want to see the rest of them!Now, that's not to say this film doesn't have it's detective twists, it's neat police work, etc etc, but this film would have been a underground legend if it had been a hour and 30 minutes of just the tapes alone, because there's so few of them in the film, that the beauty of them leaves you wanting to see so much more. One look at the homage the tapes give to the Phantom of the Opera type stylings and you'll no doubtly agree.Great movie, it really is, and it will leave you in some kind of awe!",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
85,MidiHorrorReviews,Amazingly realistic film.,9,17 September 2016,"Firstly, I must point out that this film had me second guessing the backstory research (that I had done previously) throughout! Some of the clips from this series found footage 'tapes'-that we are exposed to- are reminiscent of scenes from snuff films and appear so vividly realistic; that it became hard to distinguish when the narrative was being genuinely scary rather than real ( I will say this film is NOT a true story, but speculation is that it has some moments that resemble actual cases). It is through these raw realistic portrayals and crime show documentary style techniques, that we are drawn into the film with both awe and repulsion. We recoil at some hideous moments, terrified of the fate of the person we are viewing. We gasp as people are bound,gagged, tortured and then slain in front of our eyes. This is a film on par with Cannibal Holocaust or even the original release of The Blair Witch project, for it's believable portrayals and twisted take on the horrifying insight into a criminal's psyche. Like a studious serial killer who is etched forever in our memory (like the evolution of Hannibal Lector in the films The Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon and Hannibal), we learn how intelligent The Water Street Butcher (as he is dubbed by investigators) is and how creatively he has developed his techniques, his executions and ultimately his power over his victims.Our killer uses his crimes to set up a series of red herrings for the police, which ultimately help him to evade capture. One particular victim develops a love so fascinating for her captor that it makes us shudder at her unnerving desire to continue to please her ""Master"". We learn of how she has slowly been tortured, dominated and submerged within his world, to the point of developing symptoms of Stockholm Syndrome and thus furthering her twisted attraction to her captor (more so due to his perpetual dominance over her for several years and an inability to break free from it once her ordeal is over). Through the interviews with the victims families, forensic specialists and differing levels within law enforcement and their equally involved legal guides, we learn more about the details for these crimes and the hellish nightmare like levels of depravity our killer delves into. The use of the documentary style, the camera/video techniques, the dialogue (which is wonderfully realistic) and the casting -all unknown and believable in their roles from each angle of the film have all created this very pragmatic and factually realistic film that is a superb, if not unnerving watch in parts. My only fault is the limited release of The Poughkeepsie Tapes. It did appear at some festivals with the Dowdle brothers in 2007 upon release, but since has been pulled from the actual release (despite cinematic advertising) and not been released either cinematically or on home media to this date! It's been 9 years and further developments on why are torn between issues with distributor MGM and the possibility the films likeness was too realistic and possibly touched on some actual real life crimes of a similar nature.

Imagine how horrifying it would be to be their victim?! Cheryl really drove it home for me. That was so gutwrenching and it really stuck with me. Instead of picking apart film aesthetic, how about lose yourself in the fact that stuff like this (or worse) has happened and still happens in real life.

93,nickarsenev,Disturbing.,8,14 December 2019,"One of the best found-footage horror films, undoubtably. The Poughkeepsie Tapes balances out two important things for a good horror movie of this genre - it's very disturbing and also very believable. Although the acting could be better a lot of the times, this mockumentary still almost never had me feeling easy about it. Very well crafted, the pacing is great. Throughout the film ""interviews"" and ""the tapes"" take turns on screen, and it's really done great. To be perfectly honest for a brief moment I suspected that this actually a story based on true events, because I went into this film with almost no info about it whatsoever.
What's special about this film is that it's not just horrifying, uneasy and disturbing, but also very heartbreaking at times. There are some emotional scenes that are very believable, you really feel for the characters. Also now I finally know where's that ""-Like this? -Yes"" sample is from. Shoutout to Greafer. 8/10.

94,KillahKitty,The Mockumentary element worked better than the found footage.,6,7 August 2013,"The Poughkeepsie Tapes is a part mockumentary, part found footage film about the tracking of a serial killer, and the footage they found from his house.I gave this this film a rather average 6 out of 10; although in terms of the genre, it is probably better than most out there. For me, the mockumentary elements surpassed the quality and interest of the found footage parts - the acting and scripting of the talking heads were of good quality, believable and added depth and intrigue to the plot.However, I was expecting more horror from the 'found footage' elements of the film. While they were sinister and gory in part, they seemed to lack horror and suspense - especially as we are sold the story that the recording was a pivotal and essential element of his crime and motivation. For me the highlight was the mockumentary interviews in the final scenes - they were well acted and scripted, and very genuine. The closing scene were also very good (and while not exactly a twist due to it being somewhat predictable) it was a very good conclusion, leaving the viewer with questions but still drawing the film to a close well.Definitely worth a view if the genre is of interest to you - although if mockumentaries and FF are not of interest to you, you would probably be better off giving this a miss.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

The girl who played Cheryl did a good job, but the rest of the cast seemed like they flunked in acting class. I wonder if the budget only left $100 to pay the actors. The ridged overacting ruined the thrillride that this movie could have been. It's certainly no Paranormal Activity or Blair Witch.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

97,badbones777,A surprisingly good little film,7,1 November 2014,"I was quite impressed with this film and definitely think it's worth a watch.It is low budget and in some instances the acting isn't stellar and occasionally some of the really dark sequences make it a bit too dark to see what is going on - normally this works fine as it makes your imagination do a lot of the work, but in one or two cases I really would have liked it a little brighter just so I could follow what was happening (mainly involving the killer moving and I didn't fully catch exactly what he was doing.) This is however a fairly minor gripe and I enjoyed the film and found it pretty engrossing.As many people have noted, the standout parts of the film involve the gradual breakdown and degradation of the Cheryl Dempsey character and the Master/Slave relationship that develops between herself and the killer. It was a surprisingly effective story and I don't think the film would be anywhere near as good without it.For the most part I like that the vast majority of the killers motives and so on go completely unexplained (though it does lead me on to one of my gripes later on). One of the FBI profilers offers some conjecture as to what might have driven the killer to do these ghastly murders but that is about it. The film also does a pretty good job of making you dislike the killer (some of the stuff he does is pretty awful and sadistic) and wanting background that is never provided - in most cases this works well as it makes the viewer feel the same level of exasperation as the authorities.That said....there were a few things that didn't work for me -almost all of them mechanical/technical details.1.) There is too much emphasis on how awesomely great the killer is. By this I mean things like not a single finger print being found at the house, etc didn't work for me. I began to wonder at one point if they were building toward a superhuman/supernatural angle and it did spoil some of my suspension of disbelief.2.) Partially tying in with the above point - the whole James Foley storyline. i seriously think this entire thing could be cut form the film and it would make the film a lot better. For starters, it only serves to make the killers skills laughably good rather than intimidating (the whole taking his sperm donations from a fertility clinic......I guess it's not impossible but I found the level of planning/resources and time involved in the frame job so ludicrously unlikely that I think the film suffers for it).Secondly, given that the killer actually approaches Cheryl Dempsey's mother and she becomes aware that he is the killer before he leaves just makes the whole Foley angle even more ridiculous. If Mrs Dempsey has met the killer then unless he was masked/heavily disguised (which would be rather odd at a crime scene) then she must have known enough to know that Foley was not the killer (I don't think she comments on the Foley angle at all in the film). I certainly think she would know enough to help narrow down some of the profiling issues the authorities have been having, unless the killer actually looks like Foley, but even then, that's a pretty good lead. No, for me the Foley angle weakens the film considerably.3.) While I realise that a lot of stuff goes unexplained in this (and as I mentioned above this is mostly actually a positive thing) I think at least some hint of a reason as to why the killer chooses Cheryl to be his ""Slave"" rather than a victim would have been good.Beyond that though it is a good film and I would recommend watching it.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
98,buenoschiches,"Had potential, but lost it very early on.",2,13 July 2017,"Honestly, the concept was interesting and it started off not TOO badly, but this movie is SO TRY HARD. It seems like a horrible, sad version of an edgy torture film that a bunch of bros stand around each other in a group and go, ""Yo, you see The Poughkeepsie Tapes? Aw, man- it was ssiiiiccckkkk."" Exactly that.It lacked ANY depth, nothing was a shock and everything was predictable. You didn't get to know any of the victims or many details of the crimes. Why wasn't the house where they found the tapes registered to anyone? They still have no idea how they got that guy's sperm and didn't really care to investigate how he did that or if he chose that guy specifically? Then, more than anything, the acting was HORRID. Especially Cheryl's mother, anyone in the medical profession and any police officer. It seemed so incredibly stereotypical and like they were literally instructed to ""act like a doctor, act like a cop, act like a mom, etc."" No one acts like that. Also, police forces never refer to cases/killers as the names chosen by the media. This was all based on a bizarre 80s fantasy to make an edgy (but not really that edgy) film that would be a cool and interesting thing to happen in real life- but it's like no one attached to this film has ever done any real investigation themselves or read up on any real crime stories- they've only ever watched movies that romanticize all of this.

99,atclubsilencio,Flawed but still harrowing.,7,15 June 2012,"As of 2007 this film has yet to be released, even the sibling directors have gone on to do other films (the dreadful REC remake, Quarantine, and the not-horrible Devil.) But it's the film that hasn't been released that is their most effective work. The main weakness throughout is the acting. Sometimes it's passable, other times it is dreadful. The actors who are in the titular tapes are spot on and raw. When it comes to the talking head interviews, however, things get a little shaky.Eventually, though, this low budget freak fest finds its footing, and the audience is served a line of tapes featuring ghastly, sometimes all too real, acts of violence, torture, and dismemberment. The directors pull no punches either. They don't cut away right before the blood is shed. We are confronted with brutal and truly rattling sequences of sustained terror. But it's not all blood and guts, even though for a while it seems that's all this film has to offer. It also deals with the repercussions of abuse and the psychological damage it can cause, all leading to a denouement that is more frightening in it's implications then the gore we have witnessed. Not for the faint of heart, but if you have the patience, and you stick with it, The Poughkeepsie Tapes is ultimately a highly successful exercise in unadulterated terror. Seriously, though, some of this will singe your imagination and may make you more than a little queasy.

101,cheezomlet,I knew one of the victims of the Serial killer in Poughkeepsie,7,11 January 2008,"I have not seen the movie yet, I have no idea if its true, but it seems to be at least somewhat based on the serial Killer in Poughkeepsie. I live close to Poughkeepsie and I knew one of the women who was murdered by the serial killer (Sandy French).I do know that from what is sounds, the movie sounds grossly exaggerated..maybe Blair which and truth combined?We will see when it comes out this Spring!Here is the real story: Kendall Francois was born in the city of Poughkeepsie and grew up on Fulton Street. He attended Arlington High School, where the 6'4"" teenager played football on the school team until he graduated in 1989. He joined the Army in 1990 and went to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for basic training. In 1993, Kendall attended class at Dutchess County Community College as a liberal arts major. He continued as a student on and off until 1998.Although he was not working at the time of his arrest, he did have several jobs in the past. Kendall was employed at the Arlington Middle School from 1996-97, which is a few miles from Fulton Avenue, as a school monitor. Some teachers at the school complained about Kendall's behavior, especially toward the female students. He often played with the girls in an inappropriate manner, touching their hair and telling sexual jokes. Although he had a clean record at the Middle School, children had a strange name for Kendall. They called him ""Stinky.""During the time span surrounding the disappearances, Kendall Francois lived at home with his mother, father and younger sister, who continue to deny any knowledge of the killings. Many people wondered how the parents could not have known what was going on? Especially Kendall's mother who was employed as a nurse for many years at the Hudson River Psychiatric Center in Poughkeepsie. Surely at least she should have suspected. But it was reported that Kendall had told his parents a family of raccoons had died in the attic and he was having trouble removing the carcasses. This explanation seemed to suffice. In a statement issued through their attorney, the family had this to say: ""We find ourselves plagued by unimaginable circumstances. Our youngest son is suspected of committing grave offenses from which his life hangs in the balance. We have virtually lost everything, been dispossessed of our home and cast into the street with only the clothes on our backs.The family requests that under these extraordinary circumstances, the public and media respect the only two items we have now, our privacy and personal respect"".",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
102,redcore-2,Worthless,2,17 March 2010,"This film goes to proof how a movie about killing, torturing and mutilating people in fact can be boring when there are no brains behind it. Graphic descriptions and exaggerated sickness is far from enough for a horror to be scary. This movie constantly tries to convince me that I am scared and repulsed by repeating how sick and disturbing it is. But I do not want a movie to tell me I am disturbed, I want to feel it myself. This is another example of how sometimes the attempt to make the story seem real actually has the opposite effect – it is so unrealistically exaggerated that you start doubting in everything it claims. Mockumentary worked for The Blair Witch Project and Rec (of course the Spanish one) but it's getting really old and obviously does not always have the desired effect. I was constantly asking myself what is the point of this picture? Is it to make me aware that there are a lot of serial killers in the USA? Is it to show me how to make a homemade snuff or that if I plan carefully and change my M.O., I can kill as long as I want? I can tolerate pure entertainment if it is nicely done.

103,ax105,Chilling Pseudo-Documentary is Successful,5,21 October 2012,"Wow, what to say about this film. It is by far one of the better ""found footage"" movies out there and fits the psychological niche well as well. So, without further ado, I will break it down into a short pros and cons list.Pros: -Deeply disturbing movie, strikes all the wrong chords is all of the wrong ways. -Has some truly awful scenes that will stick with you long after the credits roll. -Fascinating and believable performances by all involved, especially the killer himself. -Suspension of disbelief is excellent, makes you think that the movie is instructional viewing for FBI, or a dark documentary. -Twisted ending. Truly awful.Cons: -There is an extremely annoying amount of ""VHS tape"" effect laid over the video. The found footage is horrifying, but almost annoying and distracting due to the shaking video and scrolling distortion lines. -Not a movie for the passive horror or psychological thriller fan. Has some very intense and awful moments that will deeply affect the uninitiated. -Struggles with pacing in some scenes. -Twisted ending. Truly awful.Bottom line, do not go into this movie expecting a bland horror film. This is a deeply disturbing movie without a happy ending, and a harsh kick in the teeth. If you are prepared for a different kind of psychological terror, then this is for you. In all honesty, I wish I had watched something happy instead.Effective film, but not one that I would want to ever watch again. 7/10",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

106,nabiki,"Not just awful, awful with a heaping side of misogyny!",1,10 December 2007,"I just saw this movie at a film festival and was simply overwhelmed with the bad. The Poughkeepsie Tapes was introduced to us as a very disturbing documentary, however it was clear from the credits (or very soon thereafter) that it simply wasn't a documentary. From there it was hard to tell where the film makers really wanted to go. Did they want it to be a comedy? There was certainly some awkward humor that brought a laugh or two at the ridiculous nature of some of the things being said or done. Or the fact that a commedia dell'arte mask that is scary in and of itself is rather less so when paired with a cape, gloves, and neck-ruff. But then there'd be the dead earnest video tape evidence, killing any humor whatsoever. Then there was the flubs in the film making that constantly took one out of the movie. For instance, the killer supposedly filmed himself over years. But the 'taped' footage is degraded fr far beyond what it would really be, and you'd think a killer so meticulous would care about the quality of image and would maybe over the course of how many years... buy a new camera? Also, at one point which is supposed to occur early on, you can see from a shadow that the camera he's holding (in 1998?) is not a VHS camera, but a hand held. The only thing that was really clear to me about this movie is that one or all of the makers really, really hates women.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

The movie was decent, for its originality and story focus (as opposed to the generic, slasher flick). I didn't find it as horrendous to watch as it was made out to be, and that was mostly due to what I'm about to mention...
The film was grossly let down by the over the top VFX. It made this very painful to watch. Old VHS tapes just do not look that bad, and it was a constantly annoying over the top attempt at selling the idea. It pulled me right out of the movie and killed the realism it was so desperately trying to sell.
It's just like, we get it, these are the killer's self shot tapes. Get over the VFX!
Also the early ""news"" segments were presented in the same manner as the later, even though they were supposed to be decades apart. Same camera quality, same graphic treatment, this was a pretty big oversight.
I guess the VFX team were too busy overdoing the tapes effects to notice!

111,amandasdumbspam,"Decent Film, but Missed Potential",5,28 September 2020,"I watched this film on a whim, not knowing much about the plot, and was surprised to find that it wasn't as bad as I had expected it to be.A lot of the plot details were ridiculously unrealistic. I usually don't ridicule horror movies for losing touch with reality, because it's one of the least normal genres out there. But because this is a found footage film that's supposed to make the viewer feel as if they're watching a series of true events, I felt that there were a lot of pieces that didn't add up. For example, the fact that the Killer didn't leave a single fingerprint in his house before abandoning it; even if he hadn't left prints, he could very well have been identified through fragments of hair, skin, saliva, any other DNA-containing bit of evidence. Additionally, we are led to believe that the young police intern/rookie was the only one that watched all of the Killer's tapes? If that's true, then law enforcement involved in this case has done a terrible job. One single kid cannot carry the weight of an entire collection of evidence. He could have missed hundreds or thousands of details that would help pinpoint the culprit, especially because his voice was present in many of the clips. Furthermore, Cheryl Dempsey's mother coming face-to-face with the Killer himself and knowing that he was the man who had her daughter is one of the most unrealistic aspects of the movie. This woman was devastated and worried to death, but when she recognized the man before her, she did nothing but stand still and provide the cops with a less-than-mediocre police sketch. Overall, the storyline was very juvenile and far-fetched to a frustrating degree. Again, I'm not one to give a damn about realism as long as the film I'm watching isn't aiming for that. But a movie like this, which is meant to feel like an actual documentary, fell flat with the storyline.Besides the plot holes, I felt that the Killer's identity was very underdeveloped. The speculations that were shared about his possible origins or motivations didn't seem to connect with his behaviors in the tapes, and the fact that he was apparently an evil genius with the ability to predict each action taken by law enforcement was laughable, as the clues he left in his tapes (such as speaking, interacting with other people in public, and driving a very specific car) would typically be more than enough evidence for police to go off on. His tendency to use theatrical props and behaviors as a way to conceal his identity made him feel less threatening to the point where I forgot I was watching a horror movie, and began looking at the film as if it was some bizarre teenager's drama class project.One of the exceptional aspects of the movie was Cheryl Dempsey's acting. She was marvellous as a victim, possessing the rare ability to cry in what sounded like true pain and agony. I was surprised to see that the actress who played her part didn't go on to greater things.Overall, this was a mediocre movie. I probably sound like the most cynical jack-ass, which I apologize for, but the juvenile tone of the film disappointed me a surprising amount. The acting was either amazing or terrible, depending on the character, so I cannot give this movie a bad rating, as my sympathies lie with the actors who truly stood out. I would recommend this film to people looking for moderate gore and disturbing scenes, as well as odd torturous tactics by the Killer.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

Because of this you are left to rely on the interviews of detectives, family members etc to really focus your intention on. However, the performance of the actors is too unrealistic and over acted, taking you out of the crafted world and really leaving nothing of value for the mockumentary as a whole.The detectives, police officers, FBI agents etc often talk about the killer with a since of respect, awe, and impressed vibe, instead of the disgust and anger or even detachment you would actually see in real life.

The story and the main character are intriguing enough without all the blood and guts. Mr. Dowdle managed to create a truly disturbed murderer whose effect on the viewer is intensified by subtly keeping his identity hidden and his fate unknown; think Blair Witch but with a depraved criminal instead. As the facts and stories accumulate fear of the stone-cold killer intensifies as we get to know him through the victims he filmed, becoming more and more deranged with each crime. This is one of the few films that grip you because of the unsettling mystery not horrific imagery.That being said, the overall quality of the film is questionable. The camera technique and movement are quite amateur which is made more unappealing by the intended tape damage throughout most of the film. Yet this little turn-off is easily adjustable once you get to grips with the murderer's journey. There are some missing facts intended to make the mystery deeper which can be seen as plot holes but in such a film, less is more.In short, if you can get past the seemingly low-budget execution you will be rewarded with a new perspective of the limits of derision.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
125,badassseth12,Incredibly well written and very disturbing,8,4 October 2010,"Rather than a cheesy rip off or mindless moronic gorefest this film takes a terrifying concept and gives it a body. The effects are slightly low budget and but very powerful when combined with the psychological effects of the story. Without going into detail, somethings are slightly off and open small holes or just seem pointless altogether. But they are few and far between. ""Ed"" the Killer is portrayed very well as a psychopath with sociopathic tendencies. The torture videos themselves are not nearly as disturbing as the underlying theme that someone could actually do this. A real breath of fresh air in a genre that seems to be nothing more than retreads of the same garbage. The blood is minimal and the film relies on the tone to frighten and disturb the viewers. It really is a shame that this film didn't make mainstream.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

127,themurphile,Ed Wood Phoned in Better Garbage,1,5 November 2015,"This movie has only one quality worthwhile and that's the actress portraying Cheryl. The mother shows zero emotion and the law enforcement characters have clearly no idea how law enforcement agents speak. One of them gives a pretty detailed description of a victim who they later show who looks absolutely nothing like the description. Mention is made of intestines being strewn about ""like Christmas lights"" but when shown the victim we see a small smudge of blood on his face and that's pretty much it. A lot of obvious things happen which you see coming from a mile away and the details of the story are not altogether original to begin with. Understanding that the poor quality of the footage is deliberate and part of the story, most of it is so bad you can't even tell what's supposed to be going on in he scene. One of the worst movies I've seen in a while but as my title alludes, if you like Ed Wood style terrible movies then it is entertaining for that purpose. If you think you're getting a good story with remotely tolerable acting then buckle up for the rocky road ahead. My only regret is the inability to give fewer than zero stars to this horrendous piece of garbage.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
128,zeroserj,Creepy and gritty...,7,8 April 2012,"...but ultimately pointless.The film rolls on at a steady pace, mixing fake interviews made with poor actors with 'found footage' which, at times, is completely unwatchable due to film makers going OTT with the 'they were VHS tapes, man!' gimmick.The highlight of the film and ultimately the saving grace is the killer's interactions and relationship with Cheryl (the chapter that includes a short, creepy interview with her is horror gold).The film is convincing and horrible but ends without a point and although I do appreciate that the 'endless ending' adds to the horror, it came across more as if the makers simply could not think of a way to wrap it up.For torture-porn movie fans only, really. Everyone else will walk away just feeling a little uneasy but not take a lot else from the film.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
129,elizabeth-carlyh,We have a keeper!,8,13 April 2013,"After contemplating what Id be sitting alone to watch, how disturbing this would actually be, and as a Mock Documentary I was very apprehensive to watch 'The Poughkeepsie Tapes'. I cant say this was the most disturbing, or scariest movie i have seen, although while watching, had me looking back over my shoulder a few times. The story was just a tad over the top from the start, the acting from the reporters, at the beginning and a few other minor characters, spoiled the reality.Otherwise I felt the acting was entertaining, especially the case officers and teacher whom were interesting, humorous and real.There was a few unanswered questions, which tends to bother me, and the 'tapes' were sometimes just too blurry to get the full effect of what was really happening, I'm still guessing? I couldn't miss a second and had to rewind if I happen to look away. I found it clever, it kept going- the end was further than expected.This is one of those films I loved, one I can't wait to tell my friends about, but follow with 'you may think its silly'.For those who can leave work at home, I would say its a keeper!",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

At first, I saw this movie on a YouTube app﻿ and could not read the description. After doing some research today, I found out it was fake, I admit I was a little disappointed. This guy would make a very interesting psychological case study. Of the entire film that I found most interesting was the Cheryl Dempsey character. After her rescue from the Butcher, the evident fact that she had Stockholm Syndrome was very sad.

131,vallabrache,Just absolutely disturbing,7,3 July 2021,"I'm a big fan of horror flicks. Most particularly; I'm a big fan of slasher films. I class slasher films into the two categories: fun slashers and disturbing slashers. A fun slasher is one whereby you almost root for the killer as the victims in the film are so vapid and 2-dimensional (think friday the 13th, nightmare on elm street).Then there are other slasher films like Poughkeepsie Tapes that are not a fun time at all, but only extremely disturbing.I found the acting to be fantastic, and I felt for the victims. The best part of the film is probably the last third - and the performance from Stacy Chbosky (Cheryl Dempsey) is particularly powerful and saddening.This is the kind of film that doesn't leave your mind after watching it. You may find yourself thinking about the disturbing nature of some people.This film gives you a glimpse into the macabre nature of a serial killer. Unlike many other films - where the serial killer is almost glamorised. This film is gritty and it is realistic.I rate harshly - so I award it a 7/10. For me, it is a good film, and definitely above average. But I would not consider it a masterpiece.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
132,oohyes300,Viewers Guilt,8,3 December 2013,"This movie is scary, definitely, I think it is so scary that a lot of people have to write either really bad reviews or really good reviews as a defense mechanism because it is so scary.I disagree with the people who are saying that the character Cheryl Dempsey had Stockholm Syndrome. I think it is suggested that the fake-documentary producer is the killer, and that she is being intimidated into saying she cares about him. I think also it is suggested that the viewer of the movie is the killer on a certain level, because in that one scene the interviewer is speaking from off camera, it sounds like he is pressuring her to make some pre-arranged statement.Maybe there were a couple of low points where the plot was weak or the acting was bad, but it would not be possible to sustain the level of outrage throughout the whole thing. The killer is so evil in some of the scenes that there isn't any way to sustain that kind of awfulness.I also was upset that we didn't get to see the killer arrested by a butch female cop, or beat to death. If there is a sequel they have to do that. It's a shame for all that built up hate against the killer to go to waste by not killing him off at the end. The movie isn't trying to make a statement about our culture, but there are definitely parallels to what Christopher Columbus and the Confederate plantation owners were doing.After I watched this, I wanted to go and beat up some slave owners, beat up some serial killers and rapists, and beat up anyone who is involved in domestic violence. The killer is a real evil guy in this movie who breathes heavy like a pervert.There's some things in horror movies that don't necessarily have to be brilliant, just show the bad guy doing horrible things so that you don't like him. I totally disagree that the girl was supposedly in love with the killer based on Stockholm Syndrome, I think it was just plain intimidation. She keeps saying ""what do you want me to say"", as if in response to someone off-camera bothering her to say something, she doesn't just come out and say ""he loves me"" un-prompted.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

134,deslegumes,Good directing altogether but falling short in the characters,4,23 May 2010,"Although this in essence is a truly scary horror movie which will undoubtedly scare happy teens for years to come, the characters in it are sadly - despite very good acting skills on some parts - largely unrealistic in the way they are portrayed. It became a bit annoying in the end, because they were all acting in that particular way, indicating that this perhaps was just a directing mistake - or I speculate it could also be that it was done intentionally to ""take the edge off"" and make the movie a bit ""less"" frightening actually (though unlikely).My issue is that there is a bit ""too much"" acting; people who have been involved in cases like these, be it up close or just a reporter, tend to speak about them in a detached, matter-of-fact way. This is both natural and helpful, and is probably a kind of defense-measure on part of the human psyche. The officers, forensic investigators, family and so on are often here showing the ""theatre"" syndrome, exaggerating both voices and body language.Maybe I'm just boring, analytical and interested in details, but don't forget - every good police officer or forensic detective probably are as well :-PIf you don't care or saw the movie and didn't notice anything unnatural, then good for you - you got your moneys worth :)For a comparison in what I mean, take a look at *any* episode of *any* true crime investigation, e.g. Crime Investigation Australia.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
135,judsonfsnell,"Amidst some stylistic shortcomings, this movie shines.",8,5 March 2011,"The excellent: Truly unsettling use of POV hand-held camera footage, made all the more nauseating given the shoddy VHS-transfer look.Visionary storytelling with multiple narrators with their own motivations (the Water Street Butcher himself, his victims, their families, law enforcement, etc).A very masterful amount of restraint in what is actually shown on screen and what isn't. Face it, after the last thirty years of horror movie filmmaking, we as audiences are almost surprised to not see every last drop of blood, inch of skin or swing of the weapon.The good: Pace, peaks and valleys are really well edited together. Cinematography is smart. And when it's working for the story, the b-roll cutaways and oversaturated time lapse landscape shots really punctuate the narrative.The less than good: Some actors' performances drag it down. The son of the convicted, the mother of the abducted and a couple of the forensic/FBI guys really come off as cartoonish.Those same b-roll and landscape shots that gave the film's morose tone and suffocating environment their occasional bursts of almost Gus Van Sant-eque surrealism just appear three times too often. Every time a new cop/authority is introduced, you can literally count the two ""before we said action"" frame up shots with their voice-over. Same goes for the undercrank landscapes - they're great - but overused.That all said, the less than good just can't overshadow how brilliant this gloves-off, hyperreal piece of true horror is. Taking cues everywhere from Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer to POV type films like Blair Witch to smart approximations of low-budget documentary work, you really do get sucked into the ride. As many have commented, this is not the six-horny-kids-get-slaughtered-off-black-man-first formulaic dirge. And though those movies have their own place and occasionally have some fun or interesting permutations on the recipe - The Poughkeepsie Tapes belongs on a different shelf altogether.It's excellent, and just a few turns of the screw away from flawless.

I usually don't like found footage films because they seem cheaply made and fake, but this one had me asking ""wait, was this a real documentary?!"" At the end. The whole time I obviously new it was a mockumentary, until the end credits when instead of using the traditional format of listing actors to their parts it simply says ""featuring"" and then lists a bunch of names. It is unclear which names are characters and which are their corresponding actors. This sent shivers down my spine. Obviously after some light Google I knew it was fiction, but it still had me second guessing my love for horror. The whole way through I took comfort in the knowledge that it was all fake, but in those final seconds, wondering if I was so twisted that I had enjoyed a real documentary about a serial killer (with that amount of gruesome footage, I love true crime documentaries as much as the next crazy-cat lady lol). Well let's just say that very few horror movies have the effect of making us question our own sanity, and this is one of them.

It seems like nowadays whenever anyone wants to make a serial-killer movie they HAVE to somehow work in child murder and other distasteful subjects.Of course, while the details of the movie may be disturbing, most of the flick itself is decidedly not. Few things could have prepared me for the sheer banality and boredom wrought upon my virgin mind by these tapes.It's also funny to find out that some people apparently thought that some of this is real.

This movie is, by the directors own admission, a mock-umentary that takes pieces from numerous serial killers and their own imagination.

148,rvadera,"Well, I didn't like it.",3,7 January 2021,"My problem with the movie is I don't understand what they were aiming for. What i got was a fake snuff film. But I am supposed to be awed by a fiendishly clever serial killer, always one step ahead of the police. But the tapes show a scumbag with no redeeming features, and people getting killed and/or tortured with nothing particuarly clever about any of it. There are some creepy moments, but mostly its just watching something terrible happen to someone on screen.Chris Dempsey was the most interesting part of the film, but they did nothing with her, beyond make her pitiful. At the end she kills herself with her suicide note announcing undying love for the killer.But nothing in the tapes show why, so what's the point of that, beyond glorifying the killer? I think if they explored that, it would have made for a far better movie. For example, Dempsey could have found out that she was a masochist and the killer being a sadist slowly realises this and understands she enjoys the torture he inflicts on her and loves him for it but being the sadist he is, he discards her, knowing no-one else can fulfil her needs, and this leads her to kill herself after being released.That would show his cleverness by the creative way he gets the one victim who enjoys her fate to kill herself in the end anyway.That would have been far more interesting and could allowed some kind of character development and the perverse personal interplay between them.Overall, it was unsatisfying. I don't enjoy watching people being hurt, that's not what I look for in a horror film. I'm not really one for the slasher genre. Either I want to feel scared, or kept guessing on what comes next or I want to see an interesting story being told using the horror format, or all three.

If you've seen even a couple movies with a similar plot before, the Poughkeepsie tapes does not offer anything you haven't seen before. I would not consider this a horror movie, and it barely deserves the genuine title of 'Thriller/Suspense'. It's more of a dark drama or an Atmospheric Thriller.

But these are few and far between. In its place, we are 'treated' to documentary footage detailing the rise of this mad man and how incredibly smart he is, in addition to a sentimental love sub plot which is just bizarre and un-realistic (which makes no sense when the root of the horror lies in realism).I expected so much form this movie and wanted to love it and embrace it much like I did REC, but when the quality of narrative is this lacking, it really isn't worth the time of day. What's more, it is incredibly frustrating to see what could have been, concentration on murder footage and less reliance on badly acted talking head segments.If you like pure horror than stay well away form this sorry excuse. A waste of a brilliantly original idea.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
151,siciliano_allineare,Enjoyed the movie,8,31 October 2009,"I read comments left by others after watching this movie. I was curious to see how ""real"" people may have thought it to be.It is a very rare thing for me, to watch a movie that affects me so much that I then search for more information after the fact. This in itself should be some measure of just how deeply the movie affected me.I found myself throughout the movie wishing that the filming was better, but I couldn't stop watching it even though the video clips of the depicted tapes were designed to look so horrible. I have read some of the posts that complained a real serial killer would have wanted better quality videotapes, that there are better video camera's out there, etc. If the killer being depicted wanted quality, he would have probably sought out a better camera, maybe perhaps, we were lead to actually think about the fact the killer used the same camera for 10 years, that he took extreme care of his camera because the film had the same flaws throughout. Whatever the case may be, the fact that a crummy video camera was used I believe was meant to evoke thought rather than a mistake that was overlooked.There are many aspects of the film that would beg questions based in reality, and thank god to be honest. Several times I felt the ""reality"" of the movie. The profiling was uncanny. The way that the killer was depicted as purposefully misleading and the methods used to do so were unnerving. We live in a society that, in general, believes that there are only a handful of serial killers at any given time, and that they are captured on a regular basis. The actual truth is far different. Most serial killers are never captured, and continue to kill over decades. It would stand to reason that the very best serial killers are never ever captured.Unnerving to say the least. I don't think this movie was meant to be another cheesy horror flick. I think this movie was meant to deeply move the viewer in such a way that it provokes thought and even fear. Long after I watched the movie, I thought about it and found myself looking at people totally differently. Thank god serial killers usually go after women or couples as I am single and don't date.There was a real realistic quality to the amateurish filming. The film maker did not focus on the master/slave aspects or even the bdsm aspects of the movie as a regular Hollywood movie might have. There was not a lot of blood and guts, or even scenes that showing violent acts with blood spurting or scenes of drawn out struggles or fighting. In this the movie was certainly far more realistic than regular horror flicks. I found myself wanting to see more about the main character while even watching the movie. Found myself wanting to watch the retired FBI agent teaching the profiling course more. Even found myself attempting to guess who the killer was and if he was in the movie itself and not just his ""tapes"".This was a very well made movie in my opinion. And now I have to ask myself why I think that so you, the reader, will understand what I mean. Forget everything that I have written above. Then think to yourself this, what makes a good movie? I think it not how it was made or who the actors are, that is what makes a movie sell. I think the more true measure of a good movie is what it makes you feel, after watching it. After all, are not movies designed to pull on our emotions? So is not a good movie one that has done a great job of making us feel something even though we may be disgusted, angry, sad or worse? And if a movie can make you feel emotions long after you watched it, is this not the sign of a very good movie? The ability to draw from a person you have never met, emotions that are so strong, that you think of them long after is also I believe, the sign of a good director.And I would further say, that if you do not get this movie then you should stick to the regular Hollywood horror flicks, they should be more to your liking.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

It was great. I'll admit, when I watched The Poughkeepsie Tapes I was under the impression that it was a real story, which just terrified me even more. This movie was the most visually shocking thing I've ever seen, real or fake. Period. I was actually a little upset at my boyfriend for letting me watch it because he knows what I can and cannot take as far as visual violence. This movie showed no mercy and for that I can ignore the bad acting. It's the best horror movie I've seen yet. After the movie my boyfriend and I talked for an hour or so about the most horrific parts, whether we thought it/parts were real, the truly sick nature of a human being like the killer was very intriguing.I think everyone needs to lay off the Hate-orade, it's obviously impaired your ability to review good movies. This movie made me nauseous, it reminded me of all the sick people in the world and that at the very moment I was watching this fictional serial killer, one was looming the United States with just as or more terrible things to do to human beings. He just hasn't been exposed yet. This movie, if nothing else, reminds you about the darker side of what human beings can do. It is, for that reason, better than any stupid humor college-frat-favorite or plot less chick flick out there right now. I recommended it to my best friend and she and her boyfriend watched it that night, she called with a lot to say about it, saying ""that's the sickest thing I've ever seen"" (referring to the brutality) - This movie is far beyond any ""horror"" film to come out in a long time. It seems all you need to make a ""horror"" movie these days is a bunch of chicks with large breasts, a vat of fake blood, and a recycled plot. Don't get me wrong, the women in this movie aren't unattractive but they're REAL looking, they look like they could live in your neighborhood and just that made it hit much closer to home.I rated this movie a 10 because in the beginning of the movie, as I am easily paranoid as is, I told myself that I was going to watch this movie through a technical lens. I was going to find flaws in the acting, the cohesiveness of the plot, the scenery, directorial oops, things of that nature. Well, ten minutes into the movie I was totally engrossed and did not resurface until well after the movie had ended. Just how this movie was able to suck me in so deeply makes it great.

Throw that overproduced saw horse manure out the window, and forget about cheesy slasher flicks, give me something that is going to stick with me for a long time and disturb me in ways I didn't think possible. Having said all that, I was very interested in this movie, and couldn't wait to finally see it, even though I am a bit late.The Poughkeepsie tapes struck me as an August Underground type film. Much of the movie was seen through the killer's perspective, giving a much needed break from traditional horror films, and this portion was poor quality, giving it an old home movie type feel. These are all good things. However this movie was plagued by bad acting, poor character development, and generally uninteresting plot, making much of it painful to watch. Most of the actors forced their lines, taking away much of the realism I think the film was trying to go for. None of the killings were particularly stunning or gruesome. In fact, I don't remember too much blood or gore at all comparatively speaking. The killer himself was barely developed, other than constantly hearing about how unique and brilliant he was at killing. Most of his tapes were filled with heavy breathing and maybe a few awkward lines that generally made me cringe from how bad they were spoken. Even August Underground, which many people thought was bad, developed the killers in a way that let the audience get to know them. The Poughkeepsie Tapes, however, developed nothing more than a man who takes some of his fetishes too far.Overall, this movie would have been good for a college film project, but falls short of anything fantastic, or even mildly entertaining.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
154,theblueteapot,bouncy bounce bounce,1,9 January 2012,"What the f*** is with the balloon?It's all ""ooh, scary torture"" and ""ooh, creepy mask"" and then BAM! Balloon bouncing. WHAT. THE. F***?My favorite part of this movie is when they're executing the cop and, in the midst of a lethal injection scene, they do a multi-coloured flashback of the balloon bouncing. And then: death! And a freeze-frame on the gal looking bewildered as the balloon pops. Damn fine directing right there. Damn fine.It was unsettling.... Though not quite as unsettling as the fact that the directors actually have a camera and free reign to make more movies (about balloons).",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
155,ApplesPWNStrawberries,You guys are being WAY to critical about this movie,7,27 September 2012,"I thought this was a pretty decent movie. It was creepy and the entire time I was on the edge of my seat wondering just HOW they were going to catch someone who's pretty much made a perfect ""persona"" and perfected his way of killing.I have to say that I'm annoyed by the amount of people saying that the acting is the worst EVER. I'm sorry, but I've seen SO MUCH worse then this. Have none of you watched a documentary before? I spend a majority of my time watching documentaries (I have NO LIFE, I know). From ones based on pure facts, to conspiracy theories; I've watched quite a handful. And one thing I can say about the ""professionals"" doing the interviews, they're ALWAYS socially awkward, and wooden on camera. THAT'S why this was so creepy and convincing to me. They're acting is fine. It's the characters they're trying to convey that's ""fake"". Trust me, watch a few documentaries and see. They trip over their words, they have long awkward pauses--one's where I honestly believe my computer/disk has frozen, laugh when it inappropriate, or just word things a bit strange. They don't know how to react to camera's, and these actors did that quite nicely. I enjoyed this movie, and I'd watch it again.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
156,eddiebrock32,Very creepy and entertaining!,7,22 October 2012,Now this movie I see most complaining about the acting or such but I am a real horror critic and I think this movie had an element of creepiness to it. I like to put myself in the shoes of the people and get a better understanding which is why this freaked me out I mean having someone like that in your neighborhood is very unsettling to me. I am the type that likes documentary based things so this came as quite a good film to me as it depicted a sporadic killer in a believable story. This is something to give a watch just to see a different side of things. If you like realistic things I suggest giving this a watch because although loosely based off of many cases it is true that these people exist in the world that give us these stories to go on.,The Poughkeepsie Tapes
157,ModernMike,An Excellent View in to the Study of a Killer,8,30 January 2017,"When I first heard about this film, I had seen the trailer before a film and then suddenly heard nothing more. Thankfully I had written the title down in the notes section of my cell phone because, had I not, I probably never would have seen this movie. I'm a student studying criminal justice with a particular interest in serial homicide. When I had broken my phone and synced my new phone with the old data I found the list of movies and noticed this was still on the list.This film takes you deep in the mind of a killer and his journey from amateur to, practically, professional level. I found the idea of having found a killer's old video documentation of his murders an interesting and great way for analysis through out the film. Personally, I have used this film for analysis in classes and my professors agree that it does help get into the mind of a killer.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
158,lilypad-657-403326,A failed attempt to shock,3,15 January 2014,"First, this kind of mockumentaries with interviews never appealed to me. Second, this particular one is just absurd. I can't really imagine FBI agents casually revealing such information or the evidence the tapes are supposed to be. Third, what was supposed to be shocking and uncomfortable to watch, turned out to be just poorly made, sometimes even funny (in the ridiculous way). The quality of the recordings, intentionally bad, is actually SO bad that I don't think any serial killer with a serious approach would agree for such a shortcoming in his masterplan. After all we're supposed to get an impression that this murderer is like nothing the FBI has ever seen before, aren't we? Well, as much as I wanted to be crept out, I'm just slightly disgusted. Of course, the movie is kind of disturbing, but it's the same feeling you'd get while doing some reading on any actual serial killer. Heck, you'd be probably feeling much worse since the Poughkeepsie killer is fictional. Others are not.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
159,justin-red54-788-251779,Crazy,7,10 September 2013,I love horror films or anything with blood and guts but they made this film look real as possible and the story is nuts and the ending with his slave makes it even crazier....if you like sick or creepy films then yea watch this because it will leave you in aw....i read the reviews and some girl said the same type of stuff as me and she said even days after watching this film she kept thinking about it and i would agree I'm going to have this film on my mind for days....i need to get drunk to forget about how this type of stuff really goes on...so yea i need 10 lines to post this thats why I'm dragging it on this looonnnggg lol,The Poughkeepsie Tapes
160,cfairman-1,what a waste!,3,8 August 2007,"O.K., first of all this film is in no way original. Think one part Blair Witch, one part Henry: Portrait of a serial killer and whole bunch of Man Bites Dog. I just sat through a preview of this and during several crucial moments of suspense and dramatic build up the crowd was laughing. The acting was more like a student film than a Hollywood thriller, which utterly killed the rather impressive mockumentary style of the film. Not to mention the supposed genius sociopath that continues to outwit police and FBI, however when we see him behind closed doors he comes across as a overzealous drama enthusiast with anger management issues. A far cry from say your average Hannibal Lecter.The pacing of the film was very awkward and the archival footage is at times a laugh riot. Beware the Technicolor balloon squashing scene! As for the positives, there were at least two really exceptional gore sequences. Everything else is your typical, underexposed, mysterious off camera violence enhanced by a creepy soundtrack. Sadly in at least two scenes you might even root for the killer simple because his victims seem so clueless and unsympathetic.Overall not a flick I'd recommend or even bother with on DVD. For gore/torture fans it has only a couple perks but the rest of the film is something you seen before.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
161,jesschurch-224-490798,Hack Horror,2,28 January 2015,"Look, this movie is definitely disturbing on many levels and that is exactly why I gave it 2 stars even though I wanted to give it none. ""Found footage"" style is the new go-to for every hack in Hollywood and I'm tired of it. It was barely good back in 1999 when Blair Witch was released. Every moronic filmmaker with a flimsy idea and no money wants to use this method. So why is this one worse than most? Because it used something real. Something this was a REAL tragedy that ruined quite a few families. And I'm not being a moralist here; I would not have had any problem with this film, had it only been artistic, original, or inventive in any way. But it wasn't. It was just another gross-out ripoff trying to suck from the teat of the Saw franchise, but even worse because actual women were murdered by this guy. So I was bothered and disgusted for NO reason, because I could have watched a legitimate documentary about this case. Or, even better, a well-made movie based on characters that weren't either victims of actual, serious crimes or fat pieces of psychotic s*** that died in their prison cells. Do we really want to appreciate anything made by sick, non-imaginative a-holes who spent this much time trying to emulate a snuff film? I sure as hell don't. This was an abomination and I regret every minute I spent watching it.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
162,paynet-51643,HOLY SNOZBERRIES!!!,8,15 November 2020,"Alright, let me start off by saying I do not do horror movies normally. Like I might do 1 or 2 a year then all the lights stay on for a week or two lol However, I do have a fascination with true crimes and serial killers. After watching a US serial killer compilation film on Prime this movie came up as a recommendation and it looked fascinating.Now I must admit I completely thought this was a real documentary about a real serial killer. There were a few moments where I was questioning it being real due to some of the ""recorded killings"" that are shown but the back story, how they wove it into reality and the quality of the documentary/interviews/specialists all had the feel of a real documentary from the 80's or 90'sThis movie is intense and while thinking it was real, was very much horrifying and heart wrenching. So I hope this will help some other easily fooled sap to have a heads up that its fake!!",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
163,milhorst,Steaming Pile,1,18 October 2021,Painful to watch....not due to the subject matter.......just because the D. P. really should have gone to film school. It burns my eyes...........................................................,The Poughkeepsie Tapes
164,corbinastin,Laughably bad,2,3 August 2021,"This film attempts to shock audiences masquerading as a murder documentary. It fails miserably with utterly nonsensical dialogue and really poor performances from almost everyone involved, the ""killer"" could be you're funny friend from down the street helping you with an art project. A total waste.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
165,cbean-03116,"In no way was this mind altering, decent movie however",7,4 April 2017,"I read so many reviews stating you cannot un-see this movie so I was hesitant about watching it. I also did some research on the actual events that took place. As the movie progressed, the facts and what was portrayed in the movie became so far from each other, it truly took any ""real feel"" away and became just another V.H.S. movie.From the real killer being African American and the killer you see on film being Caucasian to the tapes having countless murders on them when he was found guilty of eight murders. (Still heinous of course) He never killed a child but they really tried to amp up the movie with the use of a child's death in the beginning. Things like this really started to breakaway from reality and bring it back to filmography.Everyone knows that murderers are out in the world right now but there is no reason to watch this and become afraid it might happen to you. Much like you shouldn't watch a movie where someone gets cancer and tell yourself that you will get cancer now.Also, I am not speaking out as a desensitized person, the short scene with the axe had me cringing and almost looking away but it really helps that those scenes are extremely hard to literally see visually due to the grainy video style they shot with. Beyond that, there is not much ""gore"" to speak of overall in the movie.I will also point out that I enjoy film making so while some scenes may be hard for some to watch, I try and figure out how the director pulled off the shot. This, has its limitations of course. After reading the synopsis of ""A Serbian Movie"" I nearly vomited rather than wanted to see the movie.Overall, it was a decent movie, some scenes were creepy but if you do not have an issue separating reality from filmography, this movie is worth a watch without the fear of ""damaging your mental state""",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
166,scottlundberg-39006,Clearly for horror fans only,8,22 October 2021,"Disturbing, disturbing, disturbing.Looks like the original ""POV"" serial killer horror. I liked the approach to the mastermind of all serial killers ""inside view"". Ted Buddy; amateur. Very graphic and unsettling and while gripping without the Teen Scream overlap.

I watched it 10 years ago I won't watch it again as I felt physically sick watching it and generally on edge and scared as someone who falls asleep watching horror films I often get asked what's the scariest film I've seen and got me this is it !",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

169,alienkevin15,There is something here,7,27 May 2009,This is my first review ever.The horror films that Hollywood has been releasing are forgettable to say the least. This movie is not like any other slasher I have seen in a long time. This movie is what I would call a breath of fresh air to the horror genre.I just finished watching the Poughkeepsie Tapes and I am not sure what I am feeling. The movie is terrifying and it portrays some of the most brutal scenes and images I have ever seen. While watching it you feel like you have to look away for some of it but you still watch it. The whole movie reminds me of the feeling when you are driving by a car accident and you have to see what happens even if you know what you are going to see may shock you. The movie gives me hope that there are still film makers that want to push the limits and enjoy terrifying there audiences.This movie does have it's share of flaws but mostly the biggest one for me has to the acting. This flaw is pretty big because it takes away from the reality of the movie. Which sometimes is not that bad since you already think that the movie is a documentary and not a movie. Not all the roles are terrible but you can easily tell which characters I am describing.Overall I enjoyed this movie a whole lot. The Poughkeepsie Tapes will definitely shock you and will remind you that people out there still enjoy what they are doing and have fun at your expense. We should be happy that people are still doing this because that is what makes us enjoy horror so much.,The Poughkeepsie Tapes
170,linusalfmartin,"Definition of ""Creepy""",8,3 November 2018,"I've been watching a ton of horror movies to celebrate Halloween in my own way. And out of all movies I've seen this year, ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" caught my attention the most and stayed with me.In this movie we get to see some of the recovered videos from a Serial Killer, how he stalks, tortures and kills his victims.
The whole time watching this movie I was thinking ""at least none of this is real"" but by the end the movie had me doubting it was just fiction, I had to search the web to see if it really was a ""mockumentary"". Which I happily found it was.
But the fact that the movie is made well enough for me the question if it's real or not shows how good it is.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes

Beside being completely boring and the bad acting, the supposed ""VHS found footage"" was most annoying. You get typical shaky camera, but the picture quality is more like a digital filter than any kind of real damaged VHS video. I just found that too distracting and annoying to get through this film. Just awful. ...And I'm a horror movie buff that's seeing lots of terrible movies. Skip it.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
172,delucaalex,"Interested story, HORRIBLE ACTING",2,12 March 2011,"I have to start off by saying that I am an avid horror/gore movie fan. From big Hollywood to cult classics. This film had potential, the story was interesting and honestly the script was passable. The acting however is so bad that it was painful for me to watch it to its end. The actors over-act, the directors tries to do a little to much in some scenes... which does ruin any potentially horrific scene. It is honestly these little extra efforts that- in my opinion, turn this film from B movie to a terrible attempt at a true Hollywood horror movie type. One thing this director should of done is just kept things simple. Less characters: too many FBI agents, ""professionals"" and other characters that simply get lost and are forgettable ( is there really a need for 3 news reporters?). Unecassary dialog: when the ""killer"" tapes his basement/dungeon scenes, he simply talks to much to his victims- the way the actor speaks his lines and the dialog ruin these hopeful gruesome scenes. ""What is your name?....Slave is your name"" too cliché in my opinion. I do agree about the awful quality of the tapes from a supposed meticulous serial killer- even cameras on cell phones took better videos in those days. Another thing that is laughable is the use of 3 real life reporters- HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE acting and pointless. The way one of the reporter stands in front of the crime scene/house is exactly the same despite it being two different news reports. The way she holds her mic and stands is the same and just looks awfully funny. All the way down to bystanders walking in the background during interviews looks fake- a few of these ""actors"" couldn't even act a simple background walkthrough without making it look fake. The IDEA of this film was great.It could of been a decent film, with: 1- much less characters, 2- More simplisitic dialog, 3- simplifying the scenes ( no need for so many cheesy props - overuse of police car lights, police tapes,etc). Its these little things that made me cringe so many times during this movie. But overall the bad acting will be something everyone will notice it for me. If you can get past the horrible acting and cliché dialog you will find this to be an interesting story. Just so many unfortunates.",The Poughkeepsie Tapes
