0,SnoopyStyle,what I expected,3,18 December 2017,Jon Baker (Dax Shepard) and Francis Ponch Poncherello (Michael Peña) join the California Highway Patrol (CHP) as new partners in Los Angeles. Ponch is actually undercover FBI agent Castillo who has sex addiction and investigating possible corruption inside CHP. Rookie Jon is former pro biker struggling to start a new career and salvage his marriage.The gay panic humor is too broad and repetitive. I can't say that I expected more from this movie. It's exactly aimed at my expectations. It's not a praise. Dax pushes too hard which gets annoying at times. Michael Peña is too angry to the point of being unlikable. The plot is a muddled mess. The main drawback is the lack of likability of the two lead characters.,CHIPS
1,Horst_In_Translation,Comes really short in a lot of departments,4,2 October 2017,"""CHIPS"" is a new 100-minute film from this year (2017) and this one is the newest work by writer and director Dax Shepard, who also shows up as an actor in here, actually as one of the two protagonists, which should not surprise anybody really as performing in front of the camera is probably still his main profession. Before I go on about the movie, let me say that I have never seen the Golden-Globe nominated television show this is based on, so I am entirely judging this film as a standalone movie and not gonna talk about parallels or differences compared to the show I just mentioned. Okay, that's just to make my position clear. Now back to the film: Honestly I thought this wasn't a good watch at all. Peña occasionally elevated the weak material, especially in the first half and here and there, there is also a solid moment comedy-wise. So the film is not a failure as a whole. But it does have many disappointing aspects. First of all, I am a great D'Onofrio fan and seeing him as the main villain in here made me curious. But his character is so poorly written that he really can add nothing. The story depicting him as a loving father never brought any emotion at all and he is basically eventually nothing but a ruthless brute with no character development or memorability at all. Such a shame. The plot twist near the end with one female character being his accomplice honestly felt like a bad joke really.And here we already have a reference to one female character that is written poorly and while criticisms about badly-written female characters are sometimes feminist nonsense, it is very true for this movie here. Then again, the male characters weren't really written any better. Equality huh? The film tries to deliver from all kinds of perspectives, but it fails in almost all of them. The action felt all for the sake of it, not just the severed head, the friendship component between the two ""heroes"" never feels authentic and Shepard's trademark cool/fool acting routine gets repetitive and unlikable fairly quickly. It was also painfully obvious how inferior he is to Peña range-wise. They tried to hide it by giving Shepard really mostly comedy material, but it wasn't working. And the story as a whole is nothing worth watching either. Let's be honest here: Had the film ended by Hernandez kicking Jon out as it would have happened in 100% of the cases in reality, this would have been a good thing as the film would have ended quickly right away and I guess fans of the original series would have liked it. Looking at other works by Shepard and their critical reception, it is probably not too surprising that it did not turn into a quality watch here. However, it is also not Razzie material, not that bad. I don't know if it was a commercial success with audiences, but I would not be too surprised either if they decide to make a sequel at some point. ""They"" means Shepard in this case and if he goes for it, I must say I am really not curious and I'd be surprised if it turns out better than this one here. Okay, that is all I guess. This 2017 film here gets a thumbs-down from me. Not recommended.",CHIPS
2,Prismark10,Have it with some fries,5,13 June 2017,"CHIPS was a cheesy television show starring Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox. I could never see the film version being a serious action film and it is not. Dax Shepard who writes, directs and stars in it and has opted for a comedy route as in the Starsky & Hutch film.Shepard plays Baker, an ex motor cross rider who has had numerous accidents and corrective surgery leaving his body with all sorts of metal bits and dependent on pain killers. Now over the hill, he has joined CHIPS because he needs a regular job to get his estranged wife back and riding a motorbike was the only thing he was good at in police training.Michael Pena plays Poncherello a FBI agent who has gone undercover to seek out corrupt police officers. He is driven, he even shot a fellow officer in order to apprehend a bad guy and also is has a sex addict always nipping in to the bathroom.This is a mismatched buddy comedy, Poncherello gets to rely on Baker's deductive reasoning and motorcycle skills. There is not much to the plot as we know the bad guys early on in the movie.The film with its obsession on sex, toilet humour still comes across as an undemanding, silly but fun movie. They even roped Estrada in for a cameo.",CHIPS
3,nogodnomasters,You are three beers too intimate,9,15 July 2017,"Ponch (Michael Peña) is a Miami FBI agent. Jon Baker (Dax Shepard) is an ex- professional biker who barely graduates from CHP academy with his sole police skill being able to ride a bike. There are some suspect dirty cop on the police force and Ponch is sent to California to go undercover and investigate. Ponch likes the ladies with yoga pants while Baker is stuck on his ex-wife (Kristen Bell). The two are polar opposites.Other than a non-credited cameo, this had very little in common with the original series. It reminded me of the 21/22 Jump Street films except the humor in this film is more sexual. I had numerous LOL moments watching this movie as they were able to maintain running jokes. Please note when it is 5 AM in Miami, it is not 8 AM in California. That is a world that spins backwards. The plot is simple and straight forward. They are after laughs and not clever.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity",CHIPS
4,kosmasp,Chips (on their shoulder),6,29 July 2017,"As someone else stated correctly: this is not aimed at the Fans of the original TV show. But I would like to think that Dax is a fan of that show and at least in his mind tried to do it justice. Having said all that and adding that I am not the biggest fan of his, I did like the casting of Michael Pena.Now the humor is borderline, though there is something there. Some things could have been really funny. As in relevant and funny at the same time. But delivery is not the best at times. And yet the movie achieves more or less what it sets out to do. It's about entertaining, it may be gross and vulgar and you may not like it, but those who do will appreciate it",CHIPS
5,paul_haakonsen,"Sex, cops and laughs in abundance...",7,6 September 2018,"I found ""Chips"" in the comedy section on Netflix, and not being familiar with it, I decided to give it a watch as I do enjoy comedies.I was familiar with some of the cast, so I had somewhat of a bit of notion of what to expect from the movie. And I will say that ""Chips"" rose to the occasion and really delivered top notch comedy entertainment. I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the entire movie.""Chips"" was a good combination of comedy and action, as well as having a good character gallery, which really made the movie come to life. Especially so since it was characters that you instantly bonded with and took a liking to.I must admit that I am not overly keen on Dax Shepard usually, but he was really great in this movie and really carried his role quite well. But for me, then it was Michael Peña who carried the movie with his hilarious performance, and he was so greatly cast for the role. But there were also lots of other good performances throughout the movie.There are many funny scenes in the movie, and they had me laughing heartily throughout the course of the movie. And the chemistry between Shepard and Peña was just phenomenal, both as actors but also their on-screen characters.""Chips"" is a gem in the comedy genre, and one that definitely need more recognition because it is just through and through entertaining and funny.",CHIPS
6,sunwarrior13,A Mindless And Disastrous Film,2,20 June 2019,"CHiPs is a comedic film based on a great TV cop show during the late 70's and the early 80's that stars Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada with the same title. This stars Dax Shepard and Michael Pena as Officers Jon Baker and Frank ""Ponch"" Poncherello respectively.The story is simple.An undercover FBI agent in Ponch enters an FBI and teams up with Jon,an inexperienced CHP rookie. With that tandem,expect the story to make fun of their them working together. As expected,their inability to work as a team is the source of the film's comedy as they drive each other crazy.In addition to that,we also see the difference in their personalities.Finally,we also see how these officers deals with their social life and how they finally made a way to work together as a team to be able to solve a multi-million dollar crime.No question that one would be dissatisfied with this film especially the fans of the TV show. It was obviously mindless.Added to that,the the gags and comedic scenes are far from generating laughter among the viewers. One would probably be even disappointed with it particularly the show's fans as it was shown not to relive the show's legacy but to make an effort to ruin it. What is worse,it obviously insulted the viewer's intelligence as it makes an attempt at action comedy instead of trying to live up to the innocence of the TV show that provided lots of joy and happiness among its fans.The only good thing about it was having 2 amusing moments. Nothing more. Skip this film at all costs.",CHIPS
7,Theo Robertson,Unlikable Film Based Upon A Likable TV Show,2,2 April 2017,"I was never a great fan of the 1970s show CHIPS. Most of my peers liked it a lot and I could see why because it was a fairly likable show featuring a couple of fairly likable characters played by a couple fairly likable actors. The downside was that like so much American television from the period it gets a little bit preachy , but apart from that it was a likable show featuring a couple of likable characters in the California Highway Patrol in a likable American TV show ""Hey Theo can you use any other adjectives apart from likable ? otherwise this comment will end up becoming unlikable"" Sorry to bring irony in to this comment but you can see the point I'm making. When I saw the trailer I thought ""Why does Hollywood continually remake popular TV shows as crude comedies that have nothing in common with the source material ? "" Well one reason might be cynical capitalism where they know they're fleecing the public. By the time bad word of mouth spreads the damage and the profits are done so nothing else matters If you've seen the trailers you'll be scracting your head what this film has in common with the TV show CHIPS. It contains toilet humour , gay jokes and other near the knuckle humour . If nothing at least the trailer is accurate . Within the first ten minutes I'd lost count of the number of F and S words featured so much so I thought I was watching a Scorsese movie. On top of that the humour is dreadful featuring toilet humour , sexual jokes about someone's wife and ... well stuff that 15 year old boys would consider juvenile . Some people might enjoy this but I found it a genuinely unlikable film",CHIPS
8,LeonLouisRicci,Could Ruin a Movie Date...Action Hard...BUTT... Sex Comedy a Softener,5,6 July 2017,"Some of this Action/Comedy Stuff is Slightly Funny and Explosively Slick, but some of this Stuff is a Cringe Fest of the Lowest Order and Repulsively Sick.It's Hit and Miss from the Get Go.

9,zardoz-13,"These ""Chips"" Are Made for Laughing",8,3 April 2017,"""CHiPs,"" a classic police procedural television series about a couple of California Highway Patrol motorcycle policemen, ran six seasons on NBC-TV (1977-1983) and inspired a 1999 made-for-TV reunion movie. Fans of this beloved series may have to fortify their sense of humor to handle the raunchy big-screen reboot that ""Hit and Run"" writer & director Dax Shepard has produced for 21st century moviegoers. Shepard has imitated the strategy that ""Hangover"" helmer Todd Phillips used in 2004 to parody the popular television police procedural ""Starsky & Hutch"" (1975-1979) that aired for four seasons on ABC-TV. The only other crime series about police partners that successfully survived the conversion from intelligent to infantile has been ""21 Jump Street"" (1987-1991) on Fox. Surprisingly, the ""21 Jump Street"" (2012) reboot and its sequel ""22 Jump Street"" (2014), co-starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, delivered loads of laughs and coined millions at the box office. Comparably, ""Starsky & Hutch"" and Shepard's ""CHIPS"" have grossed out their audiences more than engrossed them. The sidesplitting succession of juvenile R-rated gags ridicules anybody who treats gays without tolerance, extols the advantages of Anilingus, and skewers those afflicted with a sex addiction. Not surprisingly, bawdy, lowest-common-denominator humor of this type will alienate fans of the immaculate television series. ""CHiPs"" was wholeheartedly wholesome, and its heroic duo conducted themselves as role models compared to their rude, crude, and lewd cinematic counterparts. Neither Larry Wilcox nor Eric Estrada flashed their firearms during the entire series. Jake Rossen has pointed out in his article ""14 Things You Might Not Know About CHiPs"" on the Mental Floss website: ""According to some fan tallies, a gun was drawn by police in just three out of 139 episodes—and never by Estrada or Wilcox."" Instead, Dax Shepard and co-star Michael Peña wield their pistols with reckless abandon throughout ""CHIPS.""Anybody who saw ""Hit & Run"" (2012) shouldn't be surprised that Shepard has approached the subject matter in ""CHIPS"" with tongue-in-cheek glee. Mind you, parents planning to take their children to watch the farcical ""CHIPS"" should know that the ""Kids-in-the-Mind"" website counted not only ""85 F-words and its derivatives, 14 sexual references, 41 scatological terms, 39 anatomical terms, 10 mild obscenities"" but also ""9 religious profanities (GD), 25 religious exclamations."" Imagine a no-holds-barred rendering of ""Police Academy"" with vehicular mayhem, bullet-riddled combat, grubby interracial sex, and a wire decapitation, and you've got a glimmer about how enormously ""CHIPS"" differs from ""ChiPs."" ""CHIPS"" has been reimagined as a prequel. This action farce chronicles a crime wave of explosive armored car heists and the shenanigans of two dysfunctional California Highway Patrol partners determined to crack a suspected ring of corrupt cops that have been orchestrating these robberies with military exactitude. Like most 70s and 80s police procedural reboots, the central characters that Dax Shepard and Michael Peña portray share little in common with predecessors Larry Wilcox and Eric Estrada. Peña is cast as a womanizing, sex-texting, homophobic, trigger-happy, FBI agent named Castillo on loan from the Miami, Florida, field office. He has been reassigned to work undercover as a California Highway Patrolman. Castillo abhors the alias that the Agency has conjured up: Francis Llewelyn ""Poncho"" Poncherello. Castillo's CHP partner is a fortysomething, probationary rookie, Jon Baker (Dax Shepard of ""Idiocracy""), whose glory days as an X-Games motorcross champ are dim memories. Mind you, Baker remains a virtuoso on a bike, but his accuracy with a pistol is utterly pathetic. He couldn't hit the side of a barn even if he were facing the front of the barn! Worse, he has broken as many bones as Evel Knievel, with 23 surgeries. Desperately, he hopes that his crisply-creased, brown CHP uniform will induce his estranged swim coach wife Karen (Kristen Bell of ""Veronica Mars"") to come back to him. Karen's father served as a uniformed policeman, and Jon is gambling that the uniform will do the trick. Eventually, Ponch and Jon single out veteran CHP officer Ray Kurtz (Vincent D'Onofrio of ""Full Metal Jacket"") as their chief suspect. Unfortunately, they lack adequate evidence either to link Kurtz to the raids or to pinpoint his accomplices. Ironically, our heroes don't realize that they have been mingling daily with Kurtz's accomplices inside the department. Meantime, the heat of their investigation pressures Kurtz to stop the robberies. Kurtz has been struggling to wean his errand son, Reed Jr. (Justin Chatwin of ""The Invisible""), off heroin before the authorities arrest him. Kurtz converts the millions of dollars in loot his accessories and he stole into something of equal worth—a valuable painting--that he can take across the border without fear of arrest. Before Ponch and Jon can collect sufficient evidence to collar the evil Kurtz, they must bond so they can trust each other without a second thought. Ponch must curb not only his sex addiction but also his homophobia in the CHP locker room when fellow patrolmen slap and hug each other in their underwear and try to embrace him. Similarly, Jon must recognize that his unfaithful trophy wife Karen is a lost cause. When he isn't amusing audiences with one rollicking comic scene after another, director Dax Shepard stages some exhilarating motorcycle chases. One ends in an abrupt wire decapitation. The climactic firefight between the cops and the robbers is appropriately incendiary with hails of lead flying. Happily, Shepard's Jon Baker and Peña's Ponch emerge as three-dimensional characters, fleshed out with greater depth of character than their superficial, square-jawed, prime-time counterparts in the venerable television series. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a hardboiled villain with bulldog tenacity who refuses to back down without a fight. Shepard and Peña's antics as well as their potentially offensive but uproariously funny predicaments aren't likely to endear audiences that adored the original show. For the record, ""ChiPs"" star Eric Estrada has a cameo near the end as an EMT, while Larry Wilcox is predictably nowhere in sight. ""CHIPS"" qualifies as a gritty, giddy, gung-ho reboot of ""CHiPs.""",CHIPS

They are very different people and immediately clash.I enjoyed the original CHIPS, the TV series, as a kid. My expectations for this movie weren't too high but initially it went very well. Quite funny, un-PC and fun. Michael Pena, with his particular brand of humour, was great as Ponch and gave the movie the energy and fun it needed. The crime drama side wasn't too bad either.However, from a point (unfortunately nearer the beginning than the end) the writers and director ran out of ideas and resorted to cliché and formula. The humour got weaker and more juvenile, the drama became a series of standard car chases and shoot-outs. Truly funny moments became fewer and further between and watching became a chore.In the end I wished I hadn't bothered.",CHIPS

12,ferguson-6,Dax the slash,3,23 March 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. In a Hollywood self-congratulatory world that considers sequels, reboots and remakes as creative projects; and imitation as the most sincere form of flattery  not to mention the safest hedged bet  it's not in the least surprising that we now have a film version of ""CHiPs"", a lightweight and popular TV show that ran from 1977 through 1983. What should be surprising is that a studio entrusted Dax Shepard with the ultimate slash role of Director/Writer/Producer/Actor for this contemporary version.Of course, as with film versions of ""21 Jump Street"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"", the target audience isn't really those who watched the original TV series, but rather the group of big-spending millennials who seem to thrive on raunchy humor, while placing minimal value on a coherent or interesting story. Buddy cop films that blend tense drama, wise-cracking partners and eye-widening action have long been popular, with the jewel of the genre being Lethal Weapon. This latest entry does nothing to threaten the now 30 year reign of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.Dax Shepard stars in his own film as Jon Baker, now reinvented as a former X-games motorcycle champ who is attempting to save his long-fizzled marriage by becoming a cop. The rookie's partner is undercover FBI Agent Frank ""Ponch"" Poncherello played by Michael Pena. Each has their own personal issues: Jon is addicted to prescription painkillers, and Ponch struggles to control certain urges  and unfortunately for viewers, the two spend an inordinate amount of time discussing these issues.The crime wave they are attempting to bust involves a corrupt cop. Seeing that Vincent D'Onofrio is in the cast immediately takes away any mystery about the bad guy's identity, but were there any doubt, the film exposes him in the first action sequence. After that comes the onslaught of verbal sparring, explosions, gunplay and one especially gory moment.With Dax Shepard at the helm, we understand going in that the raunchy humor faucet will be fully open. Topics covered in one-liners, gags and recurring themes include: homophobia, sexting, masturbating, bowel movements, marriage therapy, d**k jokes, prescription drugs, paparazzi, and yoga pants. But seriously, how many ""eating a**"" jokes does one movie need? It's a topic that goes from uncomfortable to unnecessary pretty quickly.Cars and bikes are vital here, though it seems that the motorcycle stunts could have been jazzed up a bit, and we certainly expected more cameos than the mandatory one near the end. The original series thrived on being 'tongue in cheek', and Mr. Shepard's version brings new meaning to the phrase. The opening credits state ""The California Highway Patrol does not endorse this film. At all."" It's an understandable stance.",CHIPS
13,FlashCallahan,Soggy Chips with too much sauce.....,1,3 April 2017,"A maverick motorbike racer reeling from a divorce and a California Highway Patrol cop who's secretly an FBI operative must overcome their personality clash and work together to uncover a major theft.....The theft is obviously the budget that was spent on this film.Dax Shepard is a name that strikes fear through me whenever I hear it. He's made some trash in the past, Hit and Run was a much as a crime as it's title, and although Employee Of The Month was a Dane Cook vehicle, his screen presence ruined every scene he was in.This film came out of the blue. The trailer was dropped a few weeks before release, and here in the UK, there was zero marketing for the film.And her's the reason why.It's an abomination, totally misogynistic, Racist, Homophobic, politically incorrect, and about as poisonous as a supposed comedy can get.When the height of humour is seeing Vincent D'onofrio working out, you know the writing is something that deserves to be put in a time capsule and buried, and years later, another generation will realise just how inept writing can be.The film is incoherent, badly acted, and focuses on nothing more than peoples weaknesses and disabilities in order to gain a few laughs.The screening in which I saw this monstrosity was a tumbleweed-esque place, not one snicker, guffaw, chortle, or any word that can describe expressing humour was heard.There is no chemistry between the leads, not even real life couple Shepard and Bell, the latter whom should start considering not depending on her husband for roles.If I see a poorer film this year, I will be shocked, because this atrocity deserves all the criticism it gets.As Brando said after watching this.....'The Horror, The Horror'....",CHIPS

It's a generic buddy-cop comedy that goes straight for the dick-touching and sex jokes that win over twelve year-old and frat boy alike. At least, they should, but there's no humor in any of this.

16,Hellmant,The good jokes are just way too few and far between!,6,30 March 2017,"'CHIPS': Three Stars (Out of Five)A cop buddy action-comedy flick, based on the popular TV series (of the same name) from the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was written and directed by Dax Shepard, who also stars in the film with Michael Pena. The movie also costars Vincent D'Onofrio, Rosa Salazar, Adam Brody and Kristen Bell (Shepard's real life wife). It tells the story of two California Highway Patrol motorcycle officers, that get into a lot of trouble when they begin investigating a corrupt cop. The movie has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's also underperformed at the Box Office. I absolutely love Dax Shepard's last writing/directorial effort, called 'HIT AND RUN' (a 2012 action- comedy flick, starring Shepard and Bell), but this film is extremely disappointing by comparison.Jon Baker (Shepard) is a former bike riding champion, that's suffering through a breakup with his extremely superficial wife, Karen (Bell). In order to try and impress her again, Jon decides to join the California Highway Patrol. Despite his only skill for the job being bike riding, Jon is hired on as a probationary officer. He's quickly partnered with an undercover FBI agent, called Frank Poncherello (Pena), who's obsessed with sex. The two get into some intense action together, when they go after a corrupt cop in their department.The film has all of the ingredients of a good cop buddy action- comedy flick, but the jokes just aren't funny enough. A lot of the movie feels kind of dry too, because of it. The action scenes are good though, the buddy relationship is well developed, and Shepard and Pena are both good in their roles. Some of the humor works too actually, but the good jokes are just way too few and far between. It's a movie most viewers can definitely wait for Netflix or Redbox to see.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/208412653",CHIPS

Unfortunately, Ponch's new partner (Dax Shepard) is a retired competition dirt bike racer with a serious painkiller addiction.However, Ponch's own secret sex addiction is also keeping him from concluding the investigation. Based on the 1980s cop drama, this boilerplate buddy-comedy written and directed by Shepard falls far short of its intrepid inspiration. Marred by unfunny jokes, an obvious villain and over-the-top bike chases, CHIPS is more trash than tribute. Unfortunately, funerals for cops who ride motorcycles do require more than one coffin.

20,The-Sarkologist,An Absolute Travesty,1,9 April 2017,"This movie was absolutely appalling. In fact it went beyond bad to be absolutely sickening. When I first heard about a remake of a classic eighties TV series (that I watched) I was a bit baffled, and somewhat disappointed, to discover that they had turned it into a comedy. Okay, there is remaking a classic series to make it somewhat more light hearted, and then there is completely butchering the memory of what was a really enjoyable series. This film basically falls into the second category. In fact I am glad that the film has actually received as bad a rating as it has (even though it isn't as bad as to satisfy me).So, as I mentioned, the film is based on an old TV series about a couple of motorcycle cops in Los Angeles who are a part of the Californian Highway Patrol (hence the name Chips). Anyway, they have changed it a but to make Frank Poncherello an FBI agent on an undercover operation who also happens to be a sex addict. As for John Baker, well, he is an ex-motorcross rider whose marriage is on the rocks, and wants to impress his wife (who is, by the way, beyond impressing). However, both of these characters are pathetic, and Baker actually goes beyond pathetic to being absolutely putrefying. The guy literally made me sick.As for the plot, well, there was one, but it was pretty pathetic as well. Mainly a couple of guys a robbing armoured trucks and it turns out that there are some people in the CHiPs squad that are helping them (which is why Poncherello has to infiltrate them). They do have a gun fight at the end, but it is really not all that fantastic. In fact the plot really didn't make all that much sense anyway, but then again that is to be expected from a movie as bad as this one.Personally, I don't mind it when they do a remake, and sometimes they can be quite fun (though never anywhere near as good as the original), however this movie when beyond being bad to the point that it was just wrong on so many levels. In the end it basically completely ruined what was a half decent series. However, it makes me want to what the remake of 21 Jump Street just to see how that one turns out.",CHIPS

22,Reno-Rangan,A tale of two motorcycle cops!,6,4 September 2017,"I haven't seen the 70s series from where this film got inspired by. But before that, I had in my mind that it could be a remake of 'Electra Glide in Blue'. Anyway, it was directed and starred in one of the main roles by Dax Shepard. His direction job is not going anywhere. Though all his so far attempts are appreciable. In this film, it was Michael Pena, who led the rest of the characters. He'd done similar roles in other films like 'End of Watch'. But literally, he ruled it by sidelining everybody else in the film, including Dax.Two motorcycle highway patrol cops team up. They are not an ideal match for the job, but they are assigned in that way by their superior. One of them was an ex-motorcycle stuntman and the other one who had lost his partner recently. They begin to investigate a highway robbery that leads them in the right direction. But can they handle those gangmen who have overpowered them in many ways is what brings twist, before ending with a big action sequence.A stylish cop flick and a quality presentation, but messed up by its screenplay. The story had a purpose, but the film scenes looked not arranged properly in order. There are many unnecessary scenes, just to bring some comedies. Yeah, some of them were really fun, but the film overwhelmed by bad jokes and random action sequences. The actors were good, though it was only the lead two who were the bright spot in the narration. If you forget all the logics, you could enjoy it. It serves a decent entertainment. Yet when it comes to rating, it won't deserve any big number.6/10",CHIPS
23,Thanos_Alfie,Funny...,5,4 April 2021,"""CHIPS"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch an experienced police officer investigating a heist with the help of a rookie officer who tries his best to help. Their cooperation starts with many problems due to their huge character differences but later they find the way to work together.I liked this movie because it was funny consisted of plenty of action scenes. The direction which was made by Dax Shepard, it was interesting and he combined very well his two main characters with their huge differences. The interpretations of both Michael Peña who played as Ponch and Dax Shepard who played as Jon were very good and they did a nice job. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Vincent D'Onofrio's who played as Ray Kurtz, Rosa Salazar's who played as Ava Perez and Ryan Hansen's who played as Brian Grieves. All in all, I have to say that ""CHIPS"" is a funny movie to spend your time and nothing more. If you have high expectations by it I advise you to lower them before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.",CHIPS
24,cruise01,A buddy cop comedy that has a few funny moments but easily forgotten.,6,31 March 2017,"Chips being remade onto the big screen after being based on a TV series which may divide the audience. I have never seen the original TV series but know about the concept idea and the actors. Dax Shepard, who is starring, wrote and directed this latest buddy cop comedy film does have its fair share of laughs and gags with a forgettable boring plot. I thought the cast Dax Shepard and Michael Pena were a lot of fun to see on screen playing John Baker and Ponch. Two motorcycle officers that are caught in police corruption and a couple of money truck heists. Dax Shepard as Baker, an ex motor cross athlete, who had several accidents leading to surgeries. Leaving him depending on pain pills. Ponch, an undercover officer that has a hard street personality and sex addiction. Seeing the two trying to work together can be entertaining and funny. The film does have its decent amount of laughs and gags. But these jokes can only go so far until it is easily forgotten by the time the film ends. Dax Shepard direction on handling bike chases was a lot of fun and exciting. It cannot make it up for the lack of plot, which most buddy cop movies usually fall back on with the old heist idea. And Baker and Ponch are caught trying to investigate their fellow officers that may be involved. Then, the sub plot of Baker trying to be the top 10 officer to impress his distant wife Karen (Kristen Bell). If you enjoy stupid humor, Chips will be enjoyable and probably one of those films you can view one time to be entertained and easily forget about it. It lacks character development and plot. The car chase sequences are exciting and Dax Shepard and Michael Pena are fun to see portraying these ionic characters. Chips is a fair comedy film that has a decent amount of laughs and gags, and may have dropped the standards on bringing the TV series to life.",CHIPS
25,eddie_baggins,"Unfunny, awful and dumb",1,18 October 2017,"The only true undeniably funny thing about Chips, an unwanted and unnecessary remake of a TV series no one cares about, is the just how criminally unfunny Dax Shepard's film is.It's not easy for a ""comedy"" to bring so little to the table of laughs but this newest example of a brash, crude, rude and daft American comedy is so bereft of laughs that you begin to take matters into your own hands and laugh at just how badly jokes are told or just how bad a group of actors that should know better are.With a plot line that is not worth the effort to write about and a bunch of characters that are led by a Shepard's sad sack one time pro-motocross rider Jon, who has zero charisma and Michael Pena's creepy undercover Ponch, who prefers looking at girls in yoga pants over solving crimes, Chips never had a chance of succeeding, which makes it one of those films you can't even fathom was ever greenlit, let alone funded to become a Hollywood event.Chips isn't exactly a property you hear a lot of people talking about but clearly Sheppard thought the world was hanging out for a reincarnation of the TV series but in trying to take a page out of the 21 Jump Street book of ""hip"" remakes, Chips feels very much like similar reboot failure Baywatch, in that it thought a bunch of dumb characters and gross out dialogue and scenarios was enough to get it over the line.It's actually embarrassing that filmmakers would think audiences would lap up tired and sad comedic tropes that are on display in Chips and it displays a lack of awareness for the industry to think that they can churn out dross like this and have people lap it up, as perhaps surprisingly to them, we should and by the looks of this films reception do expect a lot more from our escapist entertainment.It feels like Hollywood hasn't yet figured out that just because someone is talking filthy or a scenario is gross out, it doesn't make it automatically funny and the quicker comedies in the same ilk as Chips realise this, the better it will be for all parties.Final Say – A sad state of affairs for all involved, Chips is not in the slightest bit funny, memorable or even slightly likable. Directed amateurishly and acted out by its performers in a manner that suggests they all suspected they were on board a sinking ship, Chips is a deplorable comedy and a reimagining of an old property that should've stayed out of the public eye.½ a tray of kitty litter out of 5",CHIPS
26,leonblackwood,Not that funny! 3/10,3,8 October 2017,"Review: After growing up watching Chips on a regular basis, I really wasn't expecting them to do a remake, especially as a comedy, and now that I've watched it, it really didn't work. The silly comedy throughout the movie, was badly written and not that funny but the serious side of the film, was half decent. Michael Pena (Ponch), plays a undercover police officer, whose on the hunt for some crooked cops, who done a multi-million dollar heist. He's teamed up with a rookie cop, Jon (Dax Shepard), whose a motorcycle specialist, even though he has loads of wounds over his body, and he's constantly taking medication for the pain. After getting to know each others bad habits, it doesn't take them long to work out who the bad cops are but after an epic chase which leads to a tragic episode, the leader of the gang becomes remorseful, and he takes matters into his own hands. The serious part of the movie was watchable but the jokes throughout the film were pretty bad. Dax Shepard, who wrote and directed the film, obviously has a warped sense of humour, because the sexual references throughout the movie were bad taste. Anyway, the acting wasn't anything amazing, and the storyline was pretty poor but if you don't take the movie seriously, it's light-hearted fun. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Dax Shepard, 42, who also brought you Hit & Run and Brother's Justice in 2010. He wouldn't have been my first choice to bring this series to the big screen, especially as he's primarily know for his comedic roles but I was glad that he brought some seriousness to the project. He's starred in movies like the Boss, This Is Where I Leave You, The Judge, Veronica Mars alongside his wife Kristen Bell, Hit & Run, When In Rome and various other comedies. Some of the action scenes in this films were quite impressive, along with the bike scenes which looked pretty real but I still was expecting more from this, so-called reboot. Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $27millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/comedies, starring Dax Shepard, Michael Pena, Vincent D'Onofrio, Rosa Salazar, Jessica McNamee, Adam Brody, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Richard T.

30,GOWBTW,You talk about taking a wild ride!,5,19 September 2017,"There have been a lot of reboot of TV shows in the past. Some were good, others not so much. The ones I have seen were fine. Warner Bros. have done a few movie versions of their past TV shows. ""Starsky & Hutch"" was a Sony product which Warner Bros. snatched was comedic. They made ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" raunchy. But ""CHIPS"" has topped that. There were more puns and innuendos than anyone else. Making Jon Baker(Dax Shepherd) the underdog. And Frank Poncherello(Michael Pena) the more serious character of the film. This movie is different from the hit TV show. Larry Wilcox was serious. Erik Estrada was serious. Shepherd and Pena, take their roles to a whole new level. This Jon Baker is tattooed and riddled with scars. Poncherello on the other hand isn't a CHP, he's a federal agent. These two are investigating crime inside the department. This is heavy. Since this version is 21st Century, crime fighting has gone to a new level. Who would know that the captain would hit on Ponch like that. To put it like this, there was too much negative results. The heavy language, sex jokes, and the pictures from cell phones was just too much. More comedy than action. Without Erik Estrada, this movie would have been a bomb! He did save the movie. Enough of the critics, they were right about the bad points, but I enjoyed it though. This is made for individuals. But I won't forget the original TV show. 2 out of 5 stars.",CHIPS

But it was trying to hard to this raunchy comedy, and it really came up short cause of that. Now there where one or two moments where I did laughed a little. But the jokes are all over the place, and the humor goes nowhere. Shepard and Pena do have some chemistry but nothing like Wilcox and Estrada did. Michael Pena is a good dramatic actor, but also proves he can be funny also, but I thought he was funnier in ANT MAN. And Dax Shepard has always been funny and entertaining, but does not amount to much has writer and director, cause I don't think he knows how to write comedy very well.

Michael plays Frank Poncherello-originally played by Erik Estrada-and Dax plays Jon Baker-originally played by Larry Wilcox. Dax also takes writing & directing credit for this firecracker-it's not really a bomb but it is pretty close. Personally, I think if you are going to remake a movie or TV series, you should stick pretty close to the essence of the source material and here, they don't. I mean, parts are good but overall, nope. Dax plays a former pro motorbike rider that joins CHIPS while Michael is a hot-headed F.B.I. agent that is sent in undercover to find dirty cops in the CHIPS department, and of course, they are teamed up as partners. Kristen plays Dax's ex-wife that Dax is always trying to get back together with and Vincent is a fellow CHIPer. There is both comedy and drama and lots of chases and gun fights but if I remember correctly, I don't think the original stars-Erik & Larry-ever even fired their weapons. There is a cameo from Erik near the end. He plays an EMT and I am not giving anything away here because I've seen that very scene in the trailers, but Larry does not make an appearance.

35,3xHCCH,Fun Obnoxious Partners,4,23 March 2017,"There had been a lot of buddy cop movies involving one serious level-headed cop forced to work with a crazy wild cannon partner. In the 80s, they had a balance of drama and comedy like 48 Hrs. (1984), ""Lethal Weapon"" (1987) and ""Tango and Cash"" (1989). Later on, the comedy dominated, as with ""Rush Hour"" (1998), ""The Other Guys"" (2010), and ""The Heat"" (2013). This new one ""CHIPS"" now joins that long list. ""CHiPs"" was a hit TV series which ran for 6 seasons in the late 70s to the early 80s. This was a generally very wholesome, light comedy- drama series that made stars out of Larry Wilcox (as Officer Jon Baker) and specially Eric Estrada (as Officer Frank Poncherello). As with other buddy cop TV series that became films like ""Starsky and Hutch"" (2004), and ""21 Jump Street"" (2012), this new film incarnation of ""CHIPS"" is considerably edgier and raunchier than its venerable, vanilla- flavored predecessor. Jon Baker is an injury-laden ex-motorcycle riding champ who wants to save his sinking marriage by becoming a policeman, barely making it under probation as the oldest rookie on the force. His partner goes by the name of Frank Poncherello, an undercover agent sent to investigate a violent big-time heist suspected to have been perpetrated by a gang of policemen. Both of them have their own hangups and eccentricities which put them at odds with each other at first. Later though, they end up saving each other's lives and eventually forge an strong yet unconventional partnership between them. The action in this film is violent and graphic (decapitation alert!). The adrenaline mainly comes from all the breathtaking motorcycle riding stunts weaving in and out of traffic, which I hope will not encourage the already unruly motorcycle riders on the streets now. Those custom Ducati bikes they rode looked very fine and powerful. There are also car stunts, gunfights and big fiery explosions galore to keep the energy on the constant up. Another aspect that keeps the energy up is the very raunchy comedy as written by the same guy who directed and acted as its lead character Jon Baker, Dax Shepard. This comedian is mainly known for his work on TV series like ""Punk'd"" and ""Parenthood"". ""CHIPS"" is his biggest film to date. The comedy style is very shallow and juvenile, with a lot of sexual references, with a lot of naughty closeups to further amp up the raunch factor visually. Shepard's brand of comedy is very physical and over-the-top, not always funny. Michael Pena is usually seen in serious good-guy roles, like ""Crash,"" ""World Trade Center"" and ""Collateral Beauty"". I have never seen him in such a vulgar role like this one before. He looked mighty awkward doing this role, and maybe come across as miscast. However, because of this discomfort, I felt he actually funny in the role of a guy that had a lusty deviant sex drive lay beneath a calm and professional surface. Their chemistry together was really iffy, but actually gels better towards the end. If you have been reading my previous reviews on films like ""Hangover"" (MY REVIEW) or ""Sausage Party"" (MY REVIEW), raunchy comedies are not really my cup of tea. But this one had its few laugh out loud moments, mainly due to the naughty guy banter of the two lead actors. The obnoxious factor can go overboard though. As an extra bonus, a paunchy Erik Estrada had a cameo before the movie ended, not too flattering, but it was good to see him again. 4/10.",CHIPS
36,rgkarim,A Chip Off The Mundane Block,6,24 March 2017,"Robbie K here, starting the evening reviews with yet another comedy to grace the silver screen. Tonight's film is a rehash of the golden era of television (the 70s) cop comedy Chips. What does forty years of sitting in the dust mixed with the modern era of comedy bring to the table? Well my friends that is where I come from, and as always, I'm happy to share my thoughts on the latest ""masterpiece"" to grace the silver screen. So, let's roll out shall we?LIKES  Decent Story  Good Acting Chemistry  Some bike stuntsSummary: Not going to lie, I didn't have high hopes for this comedy. Yet to my surprise, Chips actually stepped up to the plate in terms of plot. It feels like an extended episode from the show, that was part action, part crime mystery, and a majority comedy. It was simplistic yes, but it works to bring the entertainment value and energy that the sitcom brought long ago. While the story was decent, the real shining value is the chemistry between the ""dynamic duo"" that really makes this movie. Dax Shepard for once didn't annoy me, as his character was balanced, surprisingly deep, and quite useful in the story, compared to some of his other roles. Although still awkward and idiotic, his antics were toned down and complemented by his partner in crime played by Michael Pena. Pena still shows his dynamic acting style, portraying both rough edged street smarts with sexual promiscuity. The stubborn mule Pena plays is blind-sided by his weaknesses, and only Dax's character can deter him from the trap that is his mind. It was very entertaining (and impressive) to see the energy both brought to the mix, alongside decent character development, kept the movie going. In addition, there were some decent stunts (primarily bike riding) that added zest to the comedy and maybe a little suspense. DISLIKES  Lazy writing  Rushed Development  Not as Funny as hoped  Perverted at timesSummary: Like many comedies, Chips suffers from some lazy writing at times. I give Shephard props for capturing some antics of the classic show, but his modern style does not give props in terms of unique writing. Let's face it, most modern comedies are all about the cursing, and while it was slightly diluted, there was unnecessary use of the cursing that wasn't funny to me. In addition, there were plenty of moments that could have been comedic gold, but the direction took a different path that was rushed and lazy, leaving little wit, surprise, or delivery to maximize laughs. And the perverted aspect, much like the cursing, got pretty old/disgusting quickly. No offense to anyone's bodies, but there were a couple of scenes where I couldn't burn the image/concept out of my head, leaving me sicker to the stomach than laughing. As for the Kristen Bell moments, they played a key character development, but her limited screen time was shallow stupidity than entertaining, but hey she did look good doing it. Outside of the comedy, the character development also could have been a little deeper and the suspense a little more if they wanted to expand upon the genre. Yet, when the single objective is comedy, the story often will take a hit. The VerdictChips has the nostalgic feel to it in terms of its plot overall, and a few cameos, but that is where it drops off. I again applaud Shepard and Pena's chemistry and how they expanded upon characters who were better known for their tight uniforms. Unfortunately, the modern telling is much like the theme of the genre, simplistic stupid moments with a curse laden dialogue and perverted moments. If this is your style, then this movie is the one for you this weekend. For the rest of my readers though, this movie is worth waiting for Netflix before feasting your eyes on this piece. While better than I thought, it would be, it still is no masterpiece. My Scores:Action/Comedy/Crime: 6.5 Movie Overall: 4.0",CHIPS
37,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of CHiPs,4,31 March 2017,"Cool cars, explosions, wire decapitations, men calling women d*cks and a-holes. Yeah it's all here in the stupefied reboot of CHiPs (my latest review). Anyway, after seeing 2012's Hit and Run, I didn't think Hollywood had it in them to greenlight another Dax Shepard movie. I was mistaken. Here we are in the present where CHiPs has Shepard as writer, producer, director, possible stuntman, and star. Dax Shepard, who might be the rude, cinematic stepchild of Hal Needham, plays Jon A. Baker. Baker is a guy who on a whim, makes the California Highway Patrol as a probationary officer. He loves to load up on Arby's, he pops tons of pills, and his disposition is altogether feminine. Baker joins the CHP in order to impress his snobby spouse who separated from him. In reality, this dimwitted buffoon wouldn't have a chance at being a real cop. Trust me. The big oaf can't even shoot straight.With the addition of Shepard's wife (Kristin Bell) being featured in a small role and some in your face motorcycle chases, CHiPs might be the ultimate ego trip for Dax (as a kid I guess he was always a fan of things with a motor). My thinking is that Shepard could get by as a character actor but he should never be able to have full control over a film again.So OK, you're curious to why I'm obviously panning CHiPs. Well it's unnecessary, assembly line junk. For one thing, CHiPs has literally nothing to do with the TV show it's based upon. The only similarities are the main character's names (Francis ""Ponch"" Poncherello and Jon Baker), the warm Cali setting, and the faint sounds of a modern day CHiPs theme playing in the background. In truth, if you were a fan of said show which ran from 1977-1983, CHiPs the movie will come off as a complete insult to your fandom. Sadly there were five people at the CHiPs screening I was at. I'm sure they all felt the same way.Now according to its wiki page, CHiPs the TV show was categorized as a action crime dramedy. Shepard's movie on the other hand, is just another raunchy, R-rated claptrap that doesn't deserve the CHiPs name. Heck, it probably should've garnered a separate title altogether. Oh and you gotta wonder why Michael Pena, an actor who appeared in Academy Award stuff like Crash, Million Dollar Baby, and Babel, would agree to co-star alongside Shepard. He obviously didn't read the screenplay and owed Shep a favor.Speaking of Dax Shepard's script, well it's patchy, vexatious, and painfully unfunny. There's no genuine comic timing between the actors in CHiPs. Their jokes and/or quips have no meaningful payoffs. Shepard would rather his movie concentrate more on the aspects of homophobia, masturbation, colitis, tossing salad (don't ask), or chopper equipment than actual police work (or a story which CHiPs clearly doesn't have). Vincent D'Onofrio and Jessica McNamee play two of the many villains in CHiPs. But because this flick is so poorly edited, you clearly don't know what criminal activities they committed in order for everyone to wanna hunt them down.All in all, CHiPs concludes with none other than the TV show's original star, Erik Estrada. He makes a small cameo in the back of an ambulance. He too talks about tossing salad (a slang term for eating one's anus) in his five minutes of screen time. Tragic. His co-star (Larry Wilcox) from back in the day, didn't appear in the movie version of CHiPs. Good move Larry. You're better for it. Rating: 1 and a half stars.",CHIPS
38,Kingslaay,Funny moments but needed more care and direction,6,12 April 2017,"I was excited to watch Chips as I could do with some action comedy. The trailer looked promising and included funny moments. Action comedies, when made coherently, are a joy to watch and quite memorable. Sadly Chips is an incoherent mess. From the beginning to the end we failed to see a any sort of concrete plot but something that loosely resembled a plot. While the crew may have known the plot we had little clue due to poor storytelling and craftsmanship. Attention, some insight and care are needed for such comedies not to go off the rails. Chips had decent actors and funny moments but lacked a coherent plot or a story to connect it together. So instead of enjoying a light headed comedy in all its glory viewers might be still trying to get a sense of the story. The film was also somewhat unoriginal since the unusual pairing of cops has been done before. It needed an interesting twist to make it a really odd pairing investigating a decent crime. It has hard to decipher what the motive and plan was as well by the villains. Unfortunately Chips is a poor man's 21 Jump Street which excelled in everything Chips failed in from a coherent story to unique characters which made the comedy pour out effortlessly.",CHIPS
39,bkrauser-81-311064,A Real Dud,5,28 March 2017,"Remember 21 Jump Street (2012)? Boy that was a fun movie. In many ways it was the perfect meta-commentary of the type of low-stakes, low-rent, low-brow crap Hollywood has been throwing at us recently like chimps in a mismanaged zoo. Literally anything and I mean anything with even a modicum of franchise potential is being made and remade and remade again these days. Thus when 21 Jump Street (based on a soapy cheap-looking TV show) reared its ugly head, I for one was clenching for an awful night at the cinema.In many ways I was expecting something like Chips, i.e. an ill-conceived, aged and offensive grotesquery that at best is a watered down version of literally everything you've already seen. Remember all those completely forgetful Martin Lawrence clones that were hammered out one-by-one in the early 2000's? Me neither; how about those equally forgettable Kevin Hart movies? Okay, getting warmer. Well imagine that plus a big fat layer of tepid, lazy direction and you got the basic ingredients for what should honestly be renamed ""Bullchips."" Chips was directed, written and stars Dax Shepard who you may remember as the dude in Without a Paddle (2004) who was not Matthew Lillard or Seth Green. Here he plays Jon Baker, an over-the-hill Motocross athlete who, according to co-star Michael Pena, is ""always two-beers too familiar."" He's the typical California ""dude"" who's far too self-involved to notice he's a walking, talking stereotype. Or at least he is until the script asks him not to be.Speaking of stereotypes, Michael Pena takes the place of the rambunctious Erik Estrada as Poncherello. In this universe he's an undercover FBI Agent searching for dirty cops, stolen loot and California dimes willing to give it up to the ""Ponch"". While it's easy to say Pena is the best part of this movie; saying that would be like complimenting the only cylinder firing on a broken motor.Chips is based off the famed 1970's TV show which ran from 1977 until 1983. As you would expect from something that hasn't been figuratively opened since the 70's, this film is a festering gob of unrecognizable gunk. The police procedural portions of the film are rote and redundant while the duo-building moments of banter reek, of awkwardness and fragile male egoisms that haven't been funny since the Reagan Administration. Yet there they are, on the screen just begging audiences to laugh as Baker and Ponch discuss at length the preference and frequency of night-long a**-licking.Aside from the film's boorish leads, Chips has a hard time communicating who or what we should actually care about. The audience is made aware of who our bad guys are long before our leads do, yet the film goes through so many airless, dimensionless minutes trying to coax our heroes in the right direction. Then the film goes into fruitless avenues to play out juvenile bits for the sake of little or no information pertinent to the story. Then, to add insult to injury they flip through a Highway Patrol database and randomly point to their bad guy because of nothing more than a mean look.It gets worse. Shepard's Baker for example takes a lot in stride – His wife's obvious infidelity, his advanced age, Ponch's bathroom habits etc. He takes it all in stride with the exception of his work which he takes on with the vigor of a newly endowed meter maid. It's supposed to be a reoccurring joke yet because the movie is so shoddily edited there are so many, either setups that are never executed or comedic payoffs that seem to come out of nowhere. Then they simply drop it in favor of Ponch's romance, I guess with a fellow officer (Bock)? Through all the mired, half-realized nonsense, only one thing remains clear – Chips was trying, trying to follow the exact same playbook as 21 Jump Street. Yet while 21 Jump had the rare quality of being reliably absurd and self-referential, this thing is just a vulgar, incompetent mess with little worthwhile to say other than ""watch out for yoga pants!""",CHIPS
40,moviexclusive,Just chip in and have fun!,6,23 March 2017,"If shows such as Starsky & Hutch and The Streets of San Francisco sounds alien to you, then there is a high chance you won't know Chips either. Chips was a successful TV series about two highway patrol officers that aired from 1977 to 1983. Comedian Dax Shepard (Parenthood, Hit & Run) basically took the title and rewrote it as a modern-day buddy cop comedy for the big screen. Surprisingly given its run-of-the-mill theme, Shepard's first major studio directorial piece actually works!Shepard plays Jon Baker, a has-been motocross champion who is trying to get his life together and hopefully winning back his trophy wife (played by the real-life Mrs Shepard, Kristen Bell) by joining the California Highway Patrol (CHP). Ponch (Michael Pena) on the other hand is a hotshot undercover FBI agent who is assigned by his boss to infiltrate the CHP when a recent heist involving an armored van is suspected to be an inside job. When a hotshot agent is paired up with a rookie, sparks are bound to fly and with any buddy cop comedy goes, this pair of mismatched buddy is going to break the ice and save the day.Liked his last movie, Hit & Run, Chips relies a lot on jokes about sexism and homopobia. The story on the whole is wafer-thin but who cares when Shepard is able to keep things interesting especially the terrific chemistry he has with co-star Michael Pena. Check out the scene where Ponch has to carry his naked, half-paralyzed buddy (Baker suffers from severe rheumatism when it rains) to the bathroom. It's hilarious. It's fortunate that Shepard's writing is way tighter this time round, it makes the gags funnier and the tone goofier. Just don't go in expecting anything smarter than a thesis.Instead of relying on unnecessary gross gags and explicit nudity unless you count two naked breast shots as offensive, Pena's Ponch is painted as a sex addict who constantly has to go to the bathroom to pleasure himself plus the fact that he can't control himself when he sees women in tight spandex. This is a recurring funny gag that works perfectly fine despite the lack of anything visual. His partner on the other hand is a lousy shooter and suffers anything from food smell to cat but he knows the make of a motorbike just from the sound of it. The relationship between these two is so genuinely crafted that by the time the credits roll, you really root for this pair of fumbling cops. Nowadays, anyone in Hollywood that needs a bad guy just need to call Vincent D'Onofrio (Daredevil, Jurassic World) or Michael Shannon. In Chips, it's the former. The prolific movie and television actor portrays Lieutenant Vic Brown, the evil mastermind behind the heists. Not much is known about this character with the exception that he has a drug-addicted son played by Justin Chatwin, the young man from Wars of the World. Brown also workout in the gym in his spare time, he is tough and he wants to retire to some remote island with all the dirty money. He looks like an interesting menacing character though the fast pacing doesn't allow him to do more.Shepard continues to bring his love for anything on wheels to the big screen. This time he is not paying tribute to muscle cars; he is piling his love on Ducati motorbikes. With actual on-location shoot along the highway and roads of busy Los Angeles, the numerous grounded chase sequences actually deliver some crazy fun. Even if you walk out feeling vexed with Shepard's silly comedy, you still need to seriously credit Shepard for not employing nonsensical quick cuts and green screen effects. This reboot or remake or whatever you want to call it is way better than the trailer. The entire premise might be inconsequential and mainly an excuse to fill in before the next slapstick humour and nifty chase lands. Yet this is Shepard's best enjoyable effort to date.",CHIPS

42,phubbs,Chips,2,22 June 2017,"'chip happens'...really?Yeah this one tagline should sum this entire movie up for anyone, if it doesn't then...umm...like I dunno, wow!So CHiPs was a light-hearted American police drama based around the Californian Highway Patrol that ran from 1977 to 1983. These guys patrolled the highways of California on their rather slick looking police motorbikes complete with cool looking uniforms and shades. The duo were young, good looking, slim, wore tight uniforms and looked dashing on their bikes, twas all about that baby. Essentially this was a TV show for young lads who looked up to cops or wanted to be cops (big change from the present day huh) and enjoyed cool vehicles. The late 70's to mid 80's was full of these types of cool shows featuring cool vehicles and stuff. 'The Dukes of Hazzard' gave the youngsters a cool muscle car to ogle at. 'Airwolf' had an ultra cool all black helicopter. 'Starsky & Hutch' had another cool muscle car. 'The A-Team' had a cool looking van and lots of plosions. 'Knight Rider' had a seriously cool all black, talking secret agent car. CHiPS was basically the same type of thing but it offered cool looking motorbikes.What I found disappointing about this movie was the simple fact that they try to do exactly what almost every other movie adaptation of these cult shows has done. Firstly they have made it an adult movie with adult content. Secondly its a comedy bordering on spoof of the franchise. And thirdly the main characters aren't actually doing the job of the original characters, they are using the positions as cover or just starting off. Yes I know they are trying to revamp the idea for the present day and yes I know they are also trying to add a fresh element. But these angles have been done before, this isn't new or clever.So the movie is actually quite violent and chock full of profanity and sexual/toilet humour. Yes I'm sure the teens may like this (maybe) but talk about alienating the core fanbase that maybe wanted to see something a bit more sensible for Pete's sake. Not only that but as I've already stated the original show was quite a light- hearted affair with little violence, so this movie has completely rejected that. Maybe a more lighter approach might have worked guys, you know instead of poo, cock, ass, drug use, masturbation gags. I mean for Christs sake! Ponch (Michael Peña) is a sex addict in this movie, every time he sees female ass he has to go jerk off. Is that the best you can do with this material??Jon Baker is played by the director & writer, Dax Shepard (gives himself the lead role huh), and boy he is bad. Apart from trying to look and sound like Owen Wilson (seriously the hair was a dead give away), this guy can't act, he's not funny, the hair just looks weird...almost like a wig, and he constantly goes around trying to show off his torso...like all the bloody time! Not only that but his uniform is clearly custom made to look as tight as possible to try and emphasis that. Peña's uniform looks normal, Shepard's looks like its bordering on skintight...yet he has no real physique. But seriously this guy was cringeworthy all the way through, a complete hit and miss mate, stick to...well actually just quit.Obviously the plot surrounds trying to catch some criminals (robbers) and obviously there is a twist involved, not that you care because the movie tells you straight away. Baker is an ex-freestyle motocross racer so that inevitably means we'll be getting some ridiculously over the top bike stunts later on down the line. His body is also wrecked from all the injuries sustained from that previous profession so there is this subplot about him having to take tonnes of medication all the time. Didn't really catch on with that but without his painkillers his body locks up or whatever, I dunno. Basically it means that Ponch has to help him into the bath tub naked at one point because hilarity! Cue cock and balls in partners face visual gag.The movie clearly has a deal with Chevrolet because that's what all the main characters drive, its so fecking obvious. Towards the midway point the duo realise their bikes aren't fast enough so they ditch them and, of course, get super fast modern bikes. Yep they both get a new sexy full body leather biker uniforms complete with police insignia; and two red hot motorbikes also with police insignia. Its at this point that the entire movie concept goes out the window and it could literally be anything. Just two leather clad stuntmen on turbo charged bikes, looking über cool and performing boring meaningless stunts.This has to be one of the most lazy, mundane and pointless movies I've seen for some time. This falls into the 'xXx' category of utter garbage of the highest order. I can't even say the action was good because it wasn't, in fact there was hardly any action at all. What you do get is so flippin' dull its really quite amazing. You have a movies essentially about fast motorbikes and you fail to make it thrilling...or even look good??!! The humour was dreadful whilst the violence profanity and gore was completely unnecessary. Shepard shouldn't have been cast and actors like Peña and Vincent D'Onofrio embarrass themselves. Almost the entire movie is just a series of setups for lame gags later on down the line, which you can see a mile off.2/10",CHIPS
43,rockman182,Chips (2017),6,13 June 2017,"Creating feature length films from old TV series must be a popular thing to do these days. This year alone we get CHIPS and Baywatch, with both upping the adult content as opposed to the much more tame TV shows. I have not seen any of Dax Shepard's previous directional efforts, nor did I know that he was making films. Having not experienced the show, I thought the film had its moments but it can't avoid being generic or unoriginal.The film is about two highway patrol officers who are very different from each other, and how they try to solve a case. One of them played by Michael Pena is an undercover FBI agent with a sex addiction and his partner is a former professional bike rider, whose long term injuries and relationship with his estranged wife plague him. I'm not sure if the original show has the similar basis for character personality but this and the chemistry between Pena and Shepard worked for me. I like the buddy cop relationship so I have no problem with it in film as long as its written well.The chemistry between the leads is good and some of the back and forth between the two is done well. Michael Pena gives a refined performance and I wonder why he doesn't lead more often in film. Other than that the plot can be simplified, there's an over complication of moving pieces that detracts from the film hitting with comedic elements. There is sufficient action in the film, especially bike based chases. I didn't mind the adult humor in it as I find it better than something tame and PG-13.The side characters aren't exactly built well. As I stated there are a lot of moving pieces and characters that come and go so its hard to really find out why people (especially the villainous group) are doing what they do. I will say though I like Kristen Bell in that bitchy uncaring role, the same of which she plays in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. This was one of the first times that I was seeing Rose Salazar and I definitely want to see her in more things, she's beautiful. Overall, the film doesn't have much originality and doesn't really stand out in memory. However, a few laughs are provided and there was enough going to provide a few moments of fun. I don't see a sequel faring well based on the reception.6/10",CHIPS
44,dave-mcclain,"""ChiPs"" is insulting to Movie Fans – and especially to those who are fans of the original TV series.",1,25 March 2017,"""CHiPs"" (R, 1:40) is early 2017's addition to the long list of feature films based on television series, a list that is full of movies that were tops, many that we flops and more than a few with cops. The most common live action adaptation model is taking a classic TV drama which had a little comedy (or even no comedy), recast it and make a movie that's a comedy with a little drama in it, or take a comedy and amp up the humor (or try to). Examples include the ""Addams Family"", ""Brady Bunch"", ""Jump Street"" and ""Naked Gun"" franchises, plus ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Charlie's Angels"", ""Dark Shadows"", ""Dragnet"" (1987), ""Get Smart"", ""Maverick"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"" (tops), ""Bewitched"", ""Car 54, Where Are You?"", ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"", ""The Honeymooners"", ""Leave it to Beaver"", ""McHale's Navy"" (1997) and ""My Favorite Martian"" (flops), ""The A-Team"", ""The Dukes of Hazzard"", ""I Spy"", ""Veronica Mars"" and ""Wild Wild West"" (somewhere in between). So, in which category does the adaptation of the late 1970s / early 1980s drama ""ChiPs"" belong? I'd say that whatever money it earns, it's way too much.Michael Peña plays a Miami-based FBI agent who is assigned by his boss (Isaiah Whitlock Jr.) to go undercover and investigate the possibility that officers from within the California Highway Patrol are behind a string of brazen armored car robberies in Southern California. He assumes the identity of an experienced CHP officer named Francis Llewelyn Poncherello who is transferring from Redding to L.A. Oh, and he has a habit of shooting his partners to save them from dangerous situations, he's a sex addict and is accused of being a homophobe. (Are you laughing yet?) Dax Sheppard (who also wrote and directed) co-stars as Jon Baker, a rookie officer who was given the job on a probationary status, only because one of the trainers at the academy (Maya Rudolph) took pity on him – and because he rides motorcycles really well. Jon is a former BMX star who had to quit the sport because of the effects of his many injuries. He now pops pain pills like candy, rainy weather puts him in even more pain and he only wants to be a CHiP because women love men in uniform and he's trying to win back the affections of his estranged cheating wife (Kristen Bell – Shepherd's much more talented real life wife). (Laughing now?) There's tension between these two officers because of their different life styles and their differences in focus (Jon trying to successfully complete his undercover assignment and get laid as much as possible and Ponch trying to survive his probationary period by writing as many tickets as possible and have sex again with his beautiful wife, if that's at all possible), but they have to learn to work together to catch the bad guys. But there's no suspense here. It's made clear early on, so it's not even a spoiler to say that CHP officers are indeed behind the armored car robberies and their leader is Officer Ray Kurtz (Vincent D'Onofrio) whose main motivation seems to be to get enough money to move his heroin-addicted son (Justin Chatwin) someplace else (where there are no drugs?). The closest thing to suspense is whether this film can produce more than an occasional snicker from the audience. (Spoiler alert: It can't.) ""CHiPs"" is insulting to Movie Fans – and especially to those who are fans of the original TV series. This adaptation bears little resemblance to its source material in tone or content. Whoever agreed to let Dax Shepard write and direct this big screen adaptation should be arrested (by real cops, because Ponch and Jon would screw it up). Shepard's idea of character development is ludicrous, offensive and completely unfunny, while the things he has his characters say and do often make no sense. And that includes the character's motivations, such as Jon's obsession with winning back a wife with whom he has no chemistry. (Ironic, huh?) If you want to see Shepard and a few random women naked, then see this movie, but not if you like your comedies to actually make you laugh (unless poorly timed and poorly presented homoerotic humor, jokes about being oversexed and characters falling off motorcycles is your idea of funny). Early on, we read on the screen: ""The California Highway Patrol does not endorse this film. At all."" I've never been with the CHP, but the MFC Facebook Page can't endorse this movie either. At all.

49,CANpatbuck3664,CHIPS Could Have Been Funnier but It's a Decent Action/Comedy,6,25 March 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* An FBI agent (Michael Pena) is facing discipline from his superiors at the Miami office. He worked as an undercover operative in a gang that robbed a bank but while they were being rounded up, they took one of the agents Clay Allen (Adam Brody) hostage. Instead of dealing with the criminal, he shoots him through Allen. He also mentions that he banged the guy's wife while the criminal is being arrested. Back at the office, he's berated by his boss Peterson (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) for being reckless and possibly being a sex addict. He tells him that he needs some time away from Miami and that they'd been contacted by the California Highway Patrol about getting some help from the Bureau. There's been a rash of armoured car robberies by gangs on motorcycles in Los Angeles. They think there's some inside help for the gang and they could possibly be looking for a mole. The agent seems excited until he finds out his undercover name is Francis Poncherello.His partner is a rookie named Jon Baker (Dax Shepard). Baker's impressive riding a motorcycle (he's a former competitive motocross champion and he's had several surgeries from crashing to prove it) but he's not very good at much else. He means well and his earnestness wins over the department into graduating him into the CHP on a probationary period. He's excited to tell his wife Karen (Kristen Bell) but they've been separated for more than a year and she doesn't seem too interested in what he's up to. Between the two of them, they have to solve these robberies and root out the corruption plaguing the CHP.Most people know Dax as an actor (I remember him from Without a Paddle) but he's actually directed movies before (Brother's Justice and Hit and Run). I really didn't like Hit and Run but the note I took from that movie was that he knew how to create some gorgeous shots of cars and car chases. He continues that here and while the action scenes aren't superhero flashy, they feature some pretty solid riding and some almost pornographic sequences of these beautiful motorcycles and what they can do. It was one of the better parts of the movie and it shows that you don't have to have a gigantic budget to entertain action movie junkies.You don't really expect extensive character development in a comedy. It can be one of those things that's a nice touch but it's rarely essential. CHIPS wasn't an especially deep movie but I did like the friendship that eventually formed between Ponch and Baker. I actually felt sorry for Baker despite the fact he was useless in essential functions of his job. He's oblivious to the situation he faces and it takes someone like Ponch to open his eyes just enough to comprehend what's going on. Shepherd and Pena play off each other well enough and you don't mind following them through this story.I'm a really big fan of some of the actors/actresses in this cast. Michael Pena is one of those guys that can cross genres and always improves the quality of something he's in. Shepherd also has his own kind of laid-back charm. I think that neither of them are bad in this movie but their performances suffer from the tonal inconsistencies that CHIPS has. Neither of them are really ""the straight man"" or the normal person you see in a buddy-cop movie. They both go from regular guys to goofy bros on a dime and it fluctuates completely from scene to scene. Both of them are funny here but neither of them are consistent or really hilarious. I did like some of the actors/actresses in the supporting parts. Rosa Salazar, Jessica McNamee, Adam Brody and Isiah Whitlock are all decent in their respective parts. Kristen Bell was good in here small part as well. I really like Vincent D'Onofrio and I felt bad for him. He showed up to work and delivers a solid dramatic performance but he seems like he's in a different movie. He's completely serious when everyone else is cracking d!@% jokes.Other than the flip-floppy tone of CHIPS, the other reason I didn't spot it more points is that it wasn't that funny. I did laugh a little throughout the movie but there wasn't anything really memorable about the comedy or lines I'm going to be quoting later. Most of the funny bits are spoiled in the trailer and while I never got angry, the humour gets pretty juvenile (the movie comments on homophobia but it has a few gay jokes that seem questionable). They also play certain jokes out a little too long like Ponch's weakness for yoga pants or the fact that John can't deal with the smell of someone else's house.I wanted to see this movie but it was hard not to get scared off by the other reviews that people were putting online. Having seen CHIPS, this could have been a lot worse. It's hard to organically weave real drama into a movie that's trying to be funny and vice-versa so I appreciate the movie trying but it came up a little short. I do think this is a step up for Shepherd and his movies seem to be getting better as he continues his career as a director. The movie this reminds me of is Keeping Up With the Joneses. There are better comedies out there but if you can keep expectations low, you might end up liking this.",CHIPS

And when i say that, i mean sex and toilet humor. it's all been done before and it's not funny anymore. Even the idea of cameos are unoriginal. You just knew Erik Estrada was gonna pop up somewhere.The plot is a hackplot - Within the CHP lies a group of corrupt cops. Our heroes have to find out who they are, provided that Jon Baker can stop dwelling on his cheating wife and Ponch can stop dwelling on his desire for sex to the point he has a chronic masturbation problem. I'm not kidding.Oh yeah, and Jane Kaczmarek? I'm pretty sure she had a body double but her character appears as a topless, sex-depraved cougar in this one. She's also the boys' boss. I'll let you think about that one.To sum this one up, Hollywood sure loves it's 70's/80's TV show remakes (Baywatch comes out later this year) But i've learned from watching past remakes like Dukes of Hazzard and Starsky & Hutch never to expect much from remakes. just a complete soiling of what made TV back then so classic.",CHIPS

60,ginocox-206-336968,"Diverse and inclusive, but not very funny",4,13 June 2017,"""CHIPS"" invests considerable time and effort in being and promoting inclusion and diversity, but not nearly enough effort in being funny. There are several scenes and discussions about homophobic behavior that aren't very funny. Clandestine homosexual relations prove to be a clue that is ignored by investigators blinded by homophobia or preconceptions. Several scenes involve a character who is unable to understand comments made in Spanish. Male heterosexual Caucasian characters are easily outnumbered by characters who are ethnic minorities, female and/or homosexual. Homophobia is one of the obstacles to the budding central romance. Hispanics are generally depicted as well adjusted, sexually confident and successful in romance, while Caucasians are hampered by insecurities and infidelities. One Caucasian character in unable to resolve his romantic issues until he embraces romance with a Hispanic character. The sexuality of middle-aged characters is explored in several scenes and a character is offended by witnessing intercourse between a morbidly obese interracial couple. This obsession with political correctness backfires in two scenes. In one, a homosexual relationship seems to be implied but later proves to be a father-son. In another, a diverse group of individuals is scanned to find a suspect described as attractive, who they all agree must be the missing young Caucasian female member of the group. At times it isn't clear whether the film is attempting to promote diversity, ridiculing it or parodying its own obsession. But the plot is given short shrift. It involves five corrupt law enforcement personnel among less than a dozen given significant screen time, meaning that most of the ones we meet are corrupt. Why so many bad apples? So the gang of criminals can be diverse and inclusive. They rob armored cars and escape on motorcycles so they can be chased by cops on motorcycles. They plan to leave the country for no particular reason. One character has a SWAT HMMWV in his garage for no particular reason. Another has an ambulance tucked away somewhere. The plot seems largely incoherent. The movie offers a few funny lines and a couple of stunts involving motorcycles, but not enough to sustain a half-hour television sitcom, much less a feature-length film.",CHIPS
61,Brooklynsmagicmike,The movie mixes gory action & sexual comedy which combines for subpar results.,5,28 December 2020,"I had never heard of or seen the series Chips before watching this film but it was on sale and my grandparents who were familiar wanted to see it so I decided to rent it. Based of the premise and cast it seemed to me at time what should be an interesting watch. It definitely endedup being an interesting watch but in very different way.First the movie while there are few laugh out loud parts. Overall it isn't super funny, and by the end of the film the jokes (which are 95% sexual oriented) get boring and tiresome. Also Michael Pena and Dax Shepard while I love each indivually as an actor, I found there chemistry in this film to be quite off at times.Secondly the action in the film is very bizarre. Some of it is silly and more of what you'd expect from action comedies. And then the rest is like something you'd see out of Rambo movie. Now its not that I don't like that type of action my issue was more that formulated with gaggy/silly type of action was off-putting.Lastly I felt the movie was extremely too long. They could of removed about 20-25 minutes from the film it wouldn't really changed much of anything at all.With all that said the reason heres why I at least gave the film at least 5 stars. The visuals were done really well. The acting wasnt necessarily bad for the most part. And the film even with its flaw keeps you engaged to get through it albeit wouldn't be film you'd most likely watch again.",CHIPS
62,kaptenvideo-89875,Probably most enjoyable for the little teenage boy in all of us,7,9 April 2017,"Comedian Dax Shepard has been acting on screen for years without making it big. He is perhaps best known as Kristen Bell's husband and being part of the main cast in drama series Parenthood"" which doesn't actually say a whole lot either. But he is one of those actors who is willing to write, produce and even direct his own stuff if satisfying offers don't come his way. And CHIPS"" must be one of these pet projects, because he fills all four jobs mentioned above, sharing the screen with co-star Michael Peña. There are actually bunch of other cool faces around in smaller roles, including – of course – Kristen Bell. But it's mostly about Shepard and Peña offering a buddy action comedy, so if you feel like you could like them, it's half a win for the movie already. (Sadly, there's smaller number of famous friends on screen than in Shepard's previous projects, 2010's Brother's Justice"" and 2012's Hit and Run"". I guess Bradley Cooper and Tom Arnold felt that they have done enough for him and let him sink or swim alone now.)Shepard is convincing in the sensitive/wise doofus role that he has chosen to himself, although his acting range seems limited in general. So he has surrounded himself with some rock solid players, starting with Peña who has the coveted ability to make every movie a bit more better just by appearing there. In this regard, he's like a young- ish Latin version of Morgan Freeman, or something. What is more important here: Peña can effortlessly do action, drama and comedy and there's need for all three here, Shepard couldn't hold the fort alone. And speaking of solid, we also have Vincent D'Onofrio who is every inch as imposing and magnetic as we have come to expect from this veteran thespian.Based on the classic TV series of the same name (1977-83), it's about the adventures of two California Highway Patrol cops. But it's not the eighties anymore, so we get currently widespread type of raunchy mainstream comedy with some action. If you want to measure the general style of the story and also the nastiness of the dialogue, you should check out the Red Band trailer, for example. It is not able to effectively share the quite enjoyable buddy comedy vibe CHIPS"" has during most of its running time, but you do get an idea if you would like to see some more of it.The result is probably most enjoyable for the little teenage boy in all of us, with plenty of cursing, light violence and sex- or body- related jokes. If you can't catch their wave, you will probably be a little tired when the end comes. I actually enjoyed most of this raunchy silliness although I felt that the ending felt a bit rushed and half-hearted.It's easy to imagine that the success of 21 Jump Street"" movies made pitching the project and gathering the money for CHIPS"" easier for Shepard & Co. The projects are quite similar: old and loved TV series turned into modern American comedy, two likable guys in the middle of it all, verbally sparring, punching and shooting their way to glory.",CHIPS
63,srdjan_veljkovic,Too little fun,5,3 February 2019,"The movie is designed for having fun. It fails simply because there is not enough of it.Otherwise, it's OK. All the elements are there. Simple, but not dull story. Decently done action. Good comedy actors doing their stuff. There are a few good laughs. Hot women.All of that is not great, mind you. Had some of it been great, maybe it would not be such a problem that it's not enough fun. For example, women are hot, but, not very hot. Kristen Bell is past her prime, Jane Kaczmarek is certainly past her prime (but, kudos, she looks great for her age), the short Latina does have a great behind, but that's all there is, and the blond is OK, just not hot enough to make a difference. There's even a scene when a bunch of female cops receive a tip that a beautiful female cop was seen at a crime scene and then they come to a silent collective conclusion that it must be the hot blonde - it's an interesting scene and joke, but, it, too is not played out great. So, it's all good, but not enough to make a difference..The main problem is that most of the fun is supposed to be had with some quick dialogues, mostly between the protagonists, but, also them and other people. Some of it works, but, most falls flat.It's not a terrible way to spend 1h40min, but, not great either, there are much better action comedies.",CHIPS
64,carlos37andre,"It's bad, but is good",5,27 December 2017,"Look, I will go straight to the point here, the movie itself it's pretty much bad, there are a lot of buddy-cop-film-stereotypes, pretty much al the characters are really superficial, some cars explode in every car accident in the movie for no reason at all (like a Michael Bay movie), the parts of the script that are meant to keep the plot going are really lazy, lame, and again, full of stereotypes of this type of movie (like the chief be a guy that pretty much yells every time that he talks with someone). Anyway, you get it, the movie isn't refreshing, does not innovate in any kind of way, and has some pretty bad acting (like Vincent D'Onofrio. In fact, every one that isn't the two main characters - Peña and Shepard - are delivering some kind of bad acting here, so, is probably the director's falt).Buuut, I found myself laughing a lot through the entire movie (mostly the first 2/3 of it), of course, some jokes doesn't work (pretty much at the end of it), but I really laugh more that I usually do in a movie a bad one (or some good ones too), so, the fun that a have watching make it not that bad for me. My advice for you is: Go see it expecting a bad movie (I did that), I'm almost sure that you will have a good time. It's a good bad movie.So, in short, Chips is a bad movie, but has some moments, and can really worth your time, if you go see it with the right thought.5,5/10",CHIPS

Baker needs to prove himself to save his marriage; Ponch (unknown to Baker) is undercover FBI and is on the trail of dirty cops. There is a statement in the beginning of the movie that says the California Highway Patrol does not endorse this movie. Good catch. No one should endorse this movie or even see it except for one thing: the motorcycle stunts and vehicle truck and car crashes are very good and we can only hope no one was hurt. One can watch the movie with the sound off (recommended) as you won't miss anything and just watch for the motorcycle rides and vehicle crashes as they are spectacular.For the rest of the movie, well, it's simply terrible. Nothing is funny. The acting is suspect and overdone all around although I will say Michael Pena is pretty good regardless of what is going on around him. The dialogues he is given are not his fault but we do wonder why he agreed to be in this. There is simply too much raunchy and crude attempts at humor much having to do with gays, male and female genital parts, bathroom habits, and sexual descriptions of the act. Way too much. This is basically the whole show. Not good. Notables: Vincent D'Onofrio as Ray Kurtz, a bad Lieutenant; Jane Kaczmarek as Captain Jane Lindel; Josh Duhamel as Rick, boyfriend of Karen (Kristen Bell) who is Baker's wife.

But, CHIPS the movie was fairly humorous - more so than the show. A number of funny lines kept one involved and it was the several side-story humor that kept the show going. This film struck me as a bit of an attempt to be Lethal Weapon type - but didn't have the potent acting or writing. The acting was below par and at times was atrocious. Not that the actors were bad but that sometimes they clearly just mailed it in. The scene where Ponch (played by Michael Pena) was confronted by his boss looked like they were reading lines off of cue cards. Literally. It had the feel of being slapped together the last minute, neither actor appeared to know his lines, and it almost seemed they were being fed lines, saying them for the first time, ever. The film was disjointed in its plot line and various story lines. One of the great things about Chips the show was that it was all about Los Angeles, and sunny, southern California. It was in that 70's Emergency family that also flowed out of Dragnet. And, the movie did not disappoint, showing many wide angle views of various parts of LA.Would never have seen this film in the theater.

This was the typical ""cop- buddy"" comedy, with one key difference from say the Starsky and Hutch remake: It was not funny at all.When I say not funny at all, I did not even crack a smile, and found myself looking at my watch. The plot is totally ridiculous, and the jokes were primarily about Ponche's sex addiction where he has to masturbate in public bathrooms, yes I am not kidding. Another theme is about Ponche's fetish about eating women's butts, clean or dirty. Yes, I am not kidding. That was a central plot line.Then there is John Baker his partner. He is basically portrayed as a opiate pill head who drives his bike high on opiates who has not taken a dump in weeks. Then there is the ""hilarious"" sequence where Ponch keeps crashing his motorcycle. Here again, it just was not funny. I guess if you are a teenager you might find the non stop bathroom/sexual stuff funny.

I watch their TV series and reality shows; in films; on Facebook groups and YouTube. I'm even followed by @COPSTV on Twitter (no pun intended)
I enjoyed watching the ChiPs TV Series (1977-1983) and I think it was good.
And I was among the first to watch CHIPS when it came out in 2017 and I loved it.. A Lot. Three years later I watched it again for the second time and boy have I not fall in love with it even (a Lot) more. This is the type of movies that you'd be watching over and over and still be enjoying it as if you're watching it for the first time.
It has everything you looking for. The story; the humor; the action; the scenery; the good actors; the music and most of all the charming women in blue.
Yet it feels different, for no other movie could make me laugh in the most intense moments as a comic relief but this one. And although this movie is so unpredictable, yet everything feels right and falls in the right place to complete a great story that you wish it never ends. So you end up watching it again because you just feel that you haven't had enough of it.
As for the actors, I love all Michael Pena movies (well all the ones I've seen so far). He's got a great presence and he steals every scene he's in with ease. I've seen him playing a policeman before in one of my other favorite cop movies; End of Watch (2012) but in that movie, in my opinion he had a darker and more realistic role to play.
Rosa Salazar (Alita) was the one that caught my eye for her slight resemblance of my favorite on-screen female cops of all time, Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan in Dexter (2006-2013).",CHIPS

Growing up in the 70's, ChiPs was one of my staple shows to watch. Ponch and Jon were my wing-men when I went out on my bicycle and cruised those roads. This was more painful than any wipe-out I ever did trying to do stupid BMX stunts on my bike with no protective gear (it was the 70's, we didn't need helmets).There was absolutely nothing of the original show left in here, except for their employer and the fact they were on motorcycles. That was about it. I did go as far as three stars for the stunts and the riding/driving performances. More of those and less of the 'dick and fart jokes' would have resulted in a much better product.This panders to the 'I don't need substance to be entertained' crowd, so if you're over 30, you likely will not enjoy this travesty. The fact that Eric Estrada even made a cameo in it speaks volumes to me (he must be having some financial troubles, or they offered him enough to overlook the obvious issues). Unlike Sausage Party, which is a raucous and raunchy romp through food porn that's expected, this overplays the stupid and underplays the subtle, occasional one liners. Less talk about eating ass, yoga pants and dick touching would have resulted in a far superior product. I think I need to go do 'The Baker' to erase that experience from my mind now.....",CHIPS

124,lewismillican,Desperately unnecessary and painfully unfunny,2,28 August 2019,"'The Californian Highway Patrol does not endorse this film. At all.' is CHIPs' opening gambit, and quite ironically almost nobody else does. To call this an incredibly disposable comedy would be a bit of an understatement. Perhaps suited to a trashy weekend movie night with a few friends, and then, and only then would it classify as a 'comedy'. Because actually, the word 'comedy' should be used very loosely indeed with CHIPS.Jon, a highway patrol officer (played by Dax sheperd) is teamed up with Ponch an FBI agent (played by Michael Peña) to investigate a heist that may or may not have crooked cops conspiring. Based on the late 70's/ early 80s TV show CHIPs, the recent reincarnation seems promising enough right? Well, comedies don't always necessarily have multifaceted plot lines, and CHIPs is no acceptation to the rule. It does however seem to be devoid of real purpose going through the motions of a storyline devoid of purpose or inspiration.There are an abundance of problems throughout the movie, but straight off the bat the worst of which are the characters themselves. Besides supporting lead Jon (whom was actually rather funny at times) the entire movie was lacking in its use of supporting characters, and completely misses the value of a subtle cameo that could bring a comical edge. Supporting lead Ponch was truly uninspiring and completely lacks the art of comic timing and delivery. This has to be expanded upon because Michael Peña is undoubtedly a fine actor, but a comic actor; questionable. Michael either has a knack of selecting shoddy projects ('War On Everyone' springs to mind), or is simply not made for comedy, most likely the later is the answer. Of course comedy is completely subjective, therefore that has to be taken into account. However, what is not in dispute is the writing throughout the movie, and a lot of the jokes, setups and punch lines were lazy, generic and tiresome.Besides that, it does have to be mentioned that the car and motorcycle chase scenes were sublime. Not only are the stunts jaw-droppingly good, but each and every chase sequence is riveting and wholly enjoyable. Alongside that the cinematography displaying California's sweeping vistas during these action sequences also bumps this movie up a few notches. Unfortunately this does not detract from the lack of substance the characters possess, nor the writing throughout the movie, as the chase sequences are only around 20% of the content. In fact if CHIPs was just a one and a half hour chase compilation it would have been entirely more watchable.CHIPs seems completely unnecessary in every way. It provides very few laughs for a 'comedy', and therefore meanders off into the realms of a very very poor action movie. For comedy to really flourish in a movie there needs to be a level of onscreen chemistry between the central characters, and there is absolutely non whatsoever. The scripting is woefully bad, and on occasion bordering on cringe. Unless you are rather intoxicated on a Friday evening with a group of friends and the night is sinking faster than the titanic, please please please don't watch this.",CHIPS

131,Joel_S,"Original Fans will Hate it, New Kids will wonder where Channing Tatum is",2,25 March 2017,"It's clear to everyone that the creators of this stupid movie were ripping off the concept of 21 Jumpstreet, i.e. do a raunchy parody movie of a more serious cop movie from 20+ years ago. This idea of doing parody gross out movies targeting 14 year old boys from an original source material that was far more serious (Starsky and Hutch, 21 Jumpstreet, CHiPs) has been in vogue the past 10-15 years. 21 Jumpstreet although pretty mental in it's own right and to a lesser extent Starsky and Hutch from 2004 had something that CHiPs does not, likable lead actors. Sure Michael Pena is highly likable, but sorry Dax Shepard is not. Dax Shepard is a weasel. Starsky and Hutch had Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson at their prime and in top form in 2004, they were very likable back then. 21 Jumpstreet had the hunky and likable Channing Tatum paired with the very likable Jonah Hill. CHiPs is a really gross and stupid movie that tries hard to be hip and cool but fails miserably. In an alternate universe Wilmer Valderrama made a more serious CHiPs movie playing Ponch in 2007.

156,seanb333,"Brilliantly executed tribute movie, great fun to watch!",10,22 July 2017,"No detailed Spoilers, 1 vague spoiler with warning at the end, but it doesn't give anything away.The original CHiPs is a good-natured cop TV show with banter, funny moments, and relatable characters that were going after the bad guys and helping people. The cheesiness came from it's OCD focus on the 2 main motorcycle cops being the coolest and getting all the chicks like Luke and Han. Well like Han anyway.Great performances by all the actors. Pena and Shepard were awesome together, I hope they make a sequel. I really liked how D'Onofrio played his part, I'm sure he had to reign in his intensity so as not to steal the show, or turn it dark. I was stoked to see Rosa Salazar again, loved her and Dak Shepard in Idiocracy. The directing was well done; this was an A movie. It combined wise-cracking, character development, and a solid plot, for good storytelling. The cameo scene with one of the original actors was funny but also great because he got to interact with our heroes. The pacing was perfect, none of those lagging scenes where you wonder why you're there. This was a well crafted movie, what you go to the theater and pay the big bucks to see.I loved how they worked in the iconic CHiPs theme song. Emphasis on ""worked in"" - comic timing genius. Yes some the humor is crude, similar to Ted, but not over the top like Southpark. I enjoyed each of these but CHiPs pulled off something special, It's Likable. Because it remained a fun buddy movie.Forget the trolls trashing this movie. They don't get what it's about. Or they don't have a sense of humor. Or they have their own agenda, for which any movie is fodder. This CHiPs movie is great fun and deserves a high rating. They pulled off a funny spin on a classic cheesy TV series without denigrating it. Not an easy feat given society today's mean appetites. Hat's off to the cast and crew!Rent this movie if you want a fun movie night! Highest recommendation.*** vague spoiler about story / characters *** Dak Shapard's take on Jon Baker - or was it the writer's take on his personal circumstances? A combo of both - anyway it's hilarious! Salacious fun, a very entertaining performance by Shepard. Think of your favorite Upright Straight Man thrown into extremely dire circumstances, life falling apart, yet keeping it together. This is what comedy is all about! And what they did with the Captain ( a father figure in the original show), played by Jane Kaczmarek, uh, well, as they say - comedy ain't pretty. Ms. Kaczmarek is though, that's not what I meant! ** END vague spoiler***",CHIPS

So, if you're a fan of the series, I cannot say whether you will enjoy this film (though based on other reviews I've read, it seems unlikely). What I can tell you is that I had low expectations and just wanted a laugh. Dax Sheppard's films have always been hit-or-miss for me. When I bought the tickets, I wasn't even aware that it was rated R. I was very pleasantly surprised! My friend and I both laughed non-stop at the off-the-wall humor. The success of the jokes was in the delivery - often very deadpan and unexpected. Some reviewers complained about the sex addiction/masturbation jokes, but I found them hilarious due to Sheppard's sincere concern and Peña's awkward embarrassment.As a motorcyclist, I very much enjoyed all the bike action and liked that they kept it relatively realistic (but don't look for realism as a general rule; that's not what comedy is about) regarding the necessary skills (Ponche thought he could match Baker and was sorely mistaken) and the comparative speed of a lightweight sport bike vs. the clunky cruisers. I also loved that, when they upgraded to sport bikes themselves, they wore proper full-body riding gear instead of promoting riding in street clothes as most films do. In short: this is a riot, not an Oscar-winner. Go for laughs, not for a serious cop film.",CHIPS

It genuinely seems like people are OFFENDED for the supposed insult to the original 80's series. Which for the record was more than 'campy' in it's own right. The original TV Series won exactly ZERO awards in the US for anything. The claim that some of the humor is a little 'vulgar' is fair; and there are some truly unnecessary 'boob nudity', but the flash of male-nudity definitely added to the hilarity of the scene.I watched it with my 73yr old Father-In-Law, my 40+yr old wife and 16yr old son. I gave my Wife a look-or-two at some of the nudity but other than that there were plenty of laughs, by all-ages. If you walk in thinking you are going to watch a goofy, sort-of-slapstick humor you will (or should) truly enjoy the movie.It will NOT be considered for Oscar consideration, it never was meant for that. It might even win some Razzy awards. I think some reviewers here judge every movie as if it was being made to give ""Best Picture"" awards a run-for-their-money...Give it a shot, I expect if you can laugh at yourself, and others without worrying you're a racist, misogynist or xenophobe you will have a good time. :)",CHIPS

I was laughing many times and enjoyed the humor. Loved it.The action scenes are really well done too. Dax has a way of keeping it a bit of the old school when he films his movies. Not CGI ridden or with loads of special effects. Naw, he just sets up long action sequences and films them, getting a real organic effect when watching the scenes.The only negatives I could give is that I was hoping to a see a little more grit, and less lightheartedness in moments of the movie.

He tells familiar stories in new ways, creates unique characters, and gives them interesting things to talk about. He reminds me of the work of Kevin Smith in that regard. This is a buddy film, 2 guys navigating life, not sure if they like each other. And Dax does a great job keeping this film from being like the last 1000 buddy films that the industry has turned into formulaic garbage. This is a fun film! Especially if you're a guy. There were just so many great ""guy"" moments, where I was like, ""yes, that's how me and my buddies would look at that situation."" It felt good to get those uniquely guy moments again, haven't seen those for... years,(Swingers comes to mind) and never this well done. Directing was solid. Acting was great.

I found myself LMAO over and over. Dax and Michael compliment each other perfectly, Vincent was spot on, I just had a good laugh. Im tired of bad reviews putting people off good flicks... grab a beer and have a light hearted night off",CHIPS
210,dbusch-27846,Significantly exceeded expectations,8,1 July 2018,"I get the impression that the people who left negative reviews did not understand what type of movie they were getting into. The first thing you need to understand before watching this movie is that it was written and directed by Dax Sheppard. With that in mind, you should expect a certain type of comedy given his background. And if you enjoy his type of comedy, than this is a can't miss. For someone with no acting experience prior to being cast on punk'd, Sheppard has built himself a pretty decent resume, and to his credit, become a talented actor, writer, and director. 
My main takeaway from this movie, aside from the fact that it is hilarious, was that Michael Pena is an incredibly versatile actor, and is just as talented in the comedic genre as he is in the dramatic genre. He steals the show in the movie. Dax Sheppard is his typical endearing self, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. If you like his work, it's definitely worth a watch.",CHIPS
