0,MartinHafer,Modern existentialism...and loud pop music from the 60s.,5,1 March 2019,"To really love and enjoy ""The Big Chill"", it would probably help if you are old...at least 65 but preferably older. I am sure many of that generation love this film...its music, its angst by a generation that were hippies and so much more. Me, I am not exactly young but feel that the movie really isn't speaking to me or my generation...at least not as much so.When the story begins, an old college friend has killed himself and all of his old college buddies arrive for the funeral. Following it, these once idealistic folks all get together to spend a weekend together. During this time, they talk and talk and talk about their lives, their regrets, angst, how their ideals have vanished and about death. All this is accompanied with pop music from the 60s...and played at a very very high volume compared to other films. I know many loved this music, but it seemed to completely dominate the picture...even more than the 50s music in ""American Graffiti"".The acting is good in this one and a lot of famous actors appear in this film before they really hit the big time. The directing will please some...though the rapid edits and way the story shifted from one group to another to another to another left me rather cold. To me, it felt very episodic...and the characters all rather self-absorbed. I didn't particularly enjoy it, though I appreciated aspects of the film and its originality.
FYI, at one point, someone in the film mentions John Beresford Tipton. He was a character from an old 50s TV show ""The Millionaire""...if you cared.",The Big Chill
1,bkoganbing,Let's all talk about Alex,8,28 February 2019,"Alex has just died and by his own hand. So Kevin Kline and Glenn Close who
knew him from college invite several of their chums from college over to their
sprawling estate in South Carolina for old time sake. Might be the last time
they all get together.Those watching The Big Chill now can't realize just how idealistic the 60s were
for so many young people. When all of them including Alex thought they would
be changing the world once they left the cocoon of college. It just didn't work
out. It was worse for Alex because he held on to the dream longer than the
rest.Such diverse characters as action hero actor Tom Berenger who tries hard not
to believe his own hype and Jeff Goldblum who writes for People Magazine and creates and destroys celebrities. Meg Tilly was Alex's girlfriend and Jobeth
Williams who is a housewife and would like to be a writer, just not one like
Goldblum. Mary Kay Place thought at one time she would be a public defender defending innocent people from oppression. She's learned over the
years that the truly innocent are few and far between. Not every female
attorney winds up being Ruth Bader Ginsberg.Most interesting of all is William Hurt and we know a lot of people got through
the 60s within a haze of marijuana smoke and other recreational drugs. He
decided there was money to be made and while he's on the high end, money
he does make in the trade quite illegally.This is quite an ensemble cast that director Lawrence Kasdan assembled and
he gave them some good words to come forth from their mouths. Even better
The Big Chill has the ultimate 60s-70s soundtrack to match the changing moods and situations the characters have.Glenn Close got nominated for a Best Supporting Actress yet it seems almost
unfair to single her out. The Big Chill is truly an ensemble effort. It also got
nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.For those who were young in the 60s, The Big Chill is your film.",The Big Chill
2,SnoopyStyle,Great ensemble cast,8,25 July 2014,"The suicide of their friend Alex brings together a group of college friends with Alex's young girlfriend Chloe (Meg Tilly). Karen Bowens (JoBeth Williams) is unhappily married. Sam Weber (Tom Berenger) is a divorced actor. Michael Gold (Jeff Goldblum) writes for People magazine. Meg Jones (Mary Kay Place) is a disillusioned former defense attorney looking to have a baby. Sarah Cooper (Glenn Close) had an affair with Alex in the past and married to successful businessman Harold Cooper (Kevin Kline). Nick Carlton (William Hurt) is an aimless Vietnam vet permanently dismembered. They stay behind for the weekend and reconnect with old drama and new issues.It's a feel good movie about a death and life from Lawrence Kasdan. Everybody is living their lives but are trying to come to terms with their former idealism after their compromises. It's a movie about people in a specific time in their lives that are jolted into some reflection. Also it's a great ensemble. Meg Tilly has some hilarious lines. Watching it again recently, it occurs to me that this movie needs a sequel.",The Big Chill
3,gavin6942,Overlooked By Today's Audiences,7,19 August 2014,"A group of seven former college friends gather for a weekend reunion at a South Carolina winter house after the funeral of one of their friends.In some ways, this film is something like ""Secaucus Seven"", with various friends who drifted apart getting back together again. These seven had high hopes in the 1960s, but are now becoming disillusioned in the 1970s (with a shoe company named after a Chairman Mao quote and a public defender who has learned that most accused criminals truly are guilty).Somehow, in the thirty years since this film was released, it has gone under the radar and has been forgotten. Despite many big stars and a notable director (Lawrence Kasdan, a protégé of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg), not to mention a great soundtrack, how has this film become forgotten?",The Big Chill
4,lee_eisenberg,"Versus ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"".",7,4 March 2006,"Most people probably know that ""The Big Chill"" was a remake of John Sayles's directorial debut ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"", about some radical friends getting back together. Here, they turned the friends into yuppies and added the part about the suicide. But it's still a good movie. Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum, Mary Kay Place, JoBeth Williams, and Meg Tilly all star, and this movie certainly affirmed that they were to be the next generation of great American actors and actresses, even if some of them didn't do too much afterwards (Kevin Costner of course played the deceased friend, even though his scenes were left on the editing room floor). And of course, there's the soundtrack: whether it's ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"", ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"", or something similar, this flick had a great selection of songs. A true classic.",The Big Chill
5,jboothmillard,The Big Chill,7,30 April 2008,"From director Lawrence Kasdan (Body Heat, Wyatt Earp) this drama about friends reunited is pretty good. Basically a group of old college friends, now grown up, come together for the funeral of Alex (Kevin Costner, who had all his scenes cut) who was at one time the brightest and best of all of them, but didn't achieve as much as the others. These friends: Harold Cooper (Kevin Kline), his wife Sarah (Oscar nominated Glenn Close), Nick Carlton (William Hurt), Michael Gold (Jeff Goldblum), Sam Weber (Platoon's Tom Berenger), Meg Jones (Mary Kay Place) and Chloe (Meg Tilly, Jennifer's sister) after the funeral try to reacquaint themselves. JoBeth Williams as Karen Bowens and Don Galloway as Richard Bowens. Besides the obvious funeral, the scenes that stick for me are the dancing around the table, and because there is no original music, some great songs have been put in, such as Aretha Franklin's ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"", The Beach Boys' ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"", The Temptations' ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg"" (which was number 94 on 100 Years, 100 Songs) and Marvin Gaye's ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"". It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. Very good!",The Big Chill
6,moonspinner55,Kasdan seems to have been raised on television (and yet has contempt for the medium),6,5 November 2001,"1960s college radicals in the present day: yuppies, aging hipsters, a television star, and a lonely wife. Director/co-writer Lawrence Kasdan was probably the kind of college radical who protested in his living room, in front of the TV set. He sets up the most obvious of gags, complete with character cut-outs, and yet he does manage a laugh or two--but it's purely on the good will brought about by the actors. The writing does not exist on any plane of reality, the changes in tone are jarring, the dialogue is frequently juvenile and/or embarrassing. Just as William Hurt is about to explain his sexual dysfunction to Mary Kay Place, we get a 'funny' jump cut to another room where the other characters react to Place's high-pitched scream, but--ha, ha--she's just reacting to a bat which has flown into the room. That's a good one. Or how about when Meg Tilly tells the story of her deceased boyfriend who didn't eat meat because he was afraid he'd be reincarnated as a steak. This is the kind of nudge-wink material Kasdan can't seem to get passed. Some of the players--Jeff Goldblum, Glenn Close and Kevin Kline, in particular--do rise above the occasion. Meg Tilly is much like a friendly, stoned bunny rabbit, but hers is an insulting role. William Hurt is made to be sullen and combative, and yet this character would not have shown up for the party. Mary Kay Place has another insulting role (she's just there to get pregnant!), and I have no idea what JoBeth Williams or Tom Berenger were trying for. A few moments do hit the bull's-eye, and the nostalgia inherent in the theme (coupled with an oldies soundtrack) was enough to win over audiences. **1/2 from ****",The Big Chill
7,Theo Robertson,Left Me Cold,3,22 March 2003,What a tedious film this is. Get a bunch of up and coming ( As these actors were in the early 80s ) film stars and put them in a plot where absolutely nothing whatsoever happens plot wise . THE BIG CHILL is so low concept that its six feet under . I can not believe this movie is so well regarded by IMDB voters . If you find a film involving some friends talking about their poor departed friend Alex compelling you may like this . Personally speaking if this is the company Alex kept while he was alive I`m not surprised he topped himself,The Big Chill
8,Scarecrow-88,The Big Chill,8,7 February 2011,"It takes a suicide to bring a group of college friends back together for his funeral. They were ""hippies"" who thought their voice could change the world, but now all of them are either rich or settled into a sort of comfortable suburbia. Kevin Kline and Glenn Close are a married couple who invite their buddies to stay the weekend after the funeral. They are about to sell their chain of stores to a corporation, becoming quite wealthy in the process. Tom Berenger is a television action star. William Hurt is a dope-head who suffered an ""unfortunate injury"" in Nam and is similar in ways to the friend who committed suicide. Mary Kay Place is a lawyer who has had little success in her sex life and simply wants a child. Jeff Goldblum is a writer for People Magazine. JoBeth Williams is an unhappy suburban housewife still in love with Berenger. Meg Tilly was the younger girlfriend of the suicide victim who remains in the house they were starting to renovate. These characters will spend time together, reminiscing, dwelling on the past, enjoying each other's company, while at the same time discussing adamantly the mistakes and disappointments which have occurred in their lives. Not exactly a real ""plot"" to speak of, more or less THE BIG CHILL works off it's awesome cast of incredible 80s talents assembled, the tone often a mixture of laughs and melancholy. It is sad that it took one of their own killing himself in order to bring these people back together, and the film follows them as they come to terms with the loss and their own futures. Developments include the revelation that Close had an affair with the suicide victim, Berenger and Williams' growing closer as the weekend continues, Kline given permission by Close to assist Place in her desire to be a mother, Hurt's interesting relationship with Tilly, etc. The soundtrack is incredible and speaks for the cast's generation, along with a screenplay that has a great deal to say. While I do prefer THE RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN, written by John Sayles, THE BIG CHILL is a movie I find irresistible because the cast appeals to me, and there's a watchability to it, in that I can return to it and never tire of it. I do believe some might consider this movie a bit ponderous and too relaxed, but I think that's part of why it continues to endure. The use of a camcorder derives some funny moments such as Hurt's chat with himself(along with Goldblum's antics, cerebral discussions with both Close and Berenger)and Tilly's airheaded nature(her sexiness is used to effect as well)is utilized to the hilt. The courtship of Berenger and Williams, and Close's deep, close friendship with Place, are given a great deal of screen time. I personally think Hurt steals the film, but the entire cast(also in abundance are the Goldblumisms)shine, each member given an opportunity to strut their stuff. There are times when conversations get a bit heated, particularly when the suicide victim is brought up, but we see how long-term friendship is lasting even during times of hurt and grieving.",The Big Chill
9,preppy-3,WAY overpraised but still lots of fun,10,30 May 2011,"A bunch of college friends from the 1960s (Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Mary Kay place and Jobeth Williams) all get together in South Carolina for a friends funeral. They're all in their mid-30s now and are, in various ways, dissatisfied with their lives and/or jobs. They spend the weekend together and bury the 60s along with their friend.This has been wildly overpraised over the years. Yes it's a fun, entertaining movie...but that's about it. I saw it when it came out in 1983. I was 21 and (maybe) too young to understand the problems these people were dealing with but the excellent acting (especially by Close), great direction, sharp script and wonderful soundtrack kept me entertained. However people who came of age in the late 1960s seemed to really ""understand"" this movie and it became a surprise hit. Over the years people have acted like it's some landmark of cinema. Well sorry folks but it isn't! It's VERY good and entertaining but that's all it is. The script is full of great one-liners...but nobody really talks that way. Also some of the situations are way too pat and predictable with obvious (and trite) happy endings all around. Yeah I DO love it but only because it's an excellent comedy-drama. It's worth seeing but don't expect some masterpiece.Also Kevin Costner was originally in the movie. His character is the one who commits suicide. However all of his scenes were cut out. Why I don't know but I think it helped the film. This is not a crack about Costner's acting--I don't think he's that bad--but he represented the 1960s in this film. I thought it was a good move to never show him. How do you put a name or face on somebody who's supposed to be representing an entire era? Well worth catching.",The Big Chill
10,grantss,"Okay, but not great",6,20 May 2015,"Okay, but not great. Script was rather basic, and contrived at times. I didn't find the characters and their relationships completely believable.Acting was, on the whole, average. Kevin Kline, Glenn Close and Tom Berenger are solid in their roles. William Hurt, as always, overthinks his part. Jeff Goldblum gives his usual irritating look-at-me performance. The entire movie ends up being saved, and made, by the soundtrack. The music is fantastic, really helps the feeling of nostalgia and keeps the movie from bogging down completely.",The Big Chill

It was a one-hour forty-five-minute retrospection of missed sexual opportunities or other missed hook-ups. This was like a long episode of friends minus the laughs and plus the lamenting.The only positive about this movie was getting to see archive footage of ex-Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler.

12,evanston_dad,The Midlife Crises of Ordinary People,5,8 February 2008,"Nothing is more boring to me than any movie or book about someone else's midlife crisis, and ""The Big Chill"" is about nothing but a bunch of privileged baby boomers in the middle of them.The big cast features all sorts of actors who would go on to become big stars of the 1980s and beyond: Glenn Close, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum. There's no denying the chemistry between these fine actors, but the whole movie feels whiny and self-indulgent. I sense that it may be one of those films that you have to be the right age to appreciate. After all, I was all of eight years old when it came out, and saw it while I was still in college. Actually, it was aimed squarely at people who in 1983 were about the age I am now, so maybe I should revisit it.Grade: C",The Big Chill
13,anaconda-40658,Big Chill Out.,8,16 September 2015,"The Big Chill (1983): Dir: Lawrence Kasdan / Cast: Tom Berenger, Kevin Kline, William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum, Glenn Close: Disjointed yet engaging drama about unity within the midst of tragedy. It opens with news of a suicide and eight friends from college who gather for the funeral and eventually spend the weekend at a summer estate. Tom Berenger plays a TV star who questions his abilities when a stunt goes wrong. Kevin Kline and Glenn Close play a married couple. He is about to score financial success in his running shoes business, while she is a doctor who once had an affair with the deceased. Interestingly their relationship is fueled by an understanding that is admirable at best. Jeff Goldblum plays a sex obsessed journalist setting his sights on the nightclub business. William Hurt plays a Vietnam vet struggling with drugs and impotence. Mary Kay Place plays a former attorney looking for someone who help her conceive. Meg Tilly plays the girlfriend of the deceased. Jobeth Williams plays an unhappily married woman looking to possibly ignite an old flame. They all interact or cross paths throughout this hazy weekend. While not overly satisfying director Lawrence Kasdan of Body Heat brings forth a portrait of several friends sharing a common bond with the deceased while reflecting upon why their bond will last long after winter turns to spring.

14,HotToastyRag,80s classic,6,12 May 2020,"Every decade has a handful of quintessential dramas that define the mindset of the people. If put into a time capsule for the 1980s, The Big Chill would certainly remind people how suburbanites viewed the world. They're all white, they're all privileged, and they're all self-centered. But since that's the point of the movie (unless I missed it) it's okay! If you're looking for a meatier Lawrence Kasdan masterpiece, you'll have to wait until the 1990s. Remember the tagline for Grand Canyon?In The Big Chill, Kevin Costner (whose scenes have been deleted) has died, and all his friends get together in a house for the weekend to grieve and explore their feelings. There have been so many movies that copy this format through the decades, so keep in mind that this one came first when you rent it. There's the yuppy couple (Glenn Close and Kevin Kline), the unhappy couple (JoBeth Williams and Don Galloway), the childless woman approaching spinsterhood (Mary Kay Place), the actor who realizes he's getting older (Tom Berenger), the artsy fellow who can't communicate without his video camera (Jeff Goldblum), the girl who can't stop stretching and showing her limber limbs (Meg Tilly), and the depressing fellow with plenty of one-liners (William Hurt). Yes, everyone thinks about his or her mortality when a friend dies, and a multitude of emotions will come up. You might find yourself questioning the importance of all the little things you value. You might wonder how solid your marriage is. You might see the value in living on through your children. You might even cry in the shower. (Yes, that's from this movie.)This is a film that will speak to people at that stage in life, seem boring to the younger folks, and be called stupid by those old enough to have seen bigger problems come and go. I liked Grand Canyon infinitely better, but that's probably because the 1990s are more my decade than the 1980s. Rent this classic and see if you like it!",The Big Chill
15,gradyharp,Heating Up THE BIG CHILL,10,22 November 2010,"THE BIG CHILL is a recurring reunion: with every viewing it brings back memories of where we all have been in a period of time that seems so distant yet so important. The film written (with Barbara Benedek) and directed by Lawrence Kasdan has reached icon status: it is as quality a memoir of baby boomer post college life that remains as poignant today as when it was released twenty seven years ago. Brought together for the funeral of suicide victim Alex, eight friends gather for a weekend of remembering and reliving the times when they were all students - Alex being the most promising of them all - and wondering what drove their little hero to kill himself. Each of the friends, through self produced play with a video camera. Through intimate conversations, and through the psychology of group 'therapy' explains where they are now in comparison to where they thought they would be. The only member of the group who is 'new' is Chloe (Meg Tilly) who had been Alex's girlfriend. The group - Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, and Jobeth Williams interact philosophically, over food making in the kitchen of the Close/Kline home, share frustrations and fulfill expectations in both friendship and physical interactions. Surrounding this film is a selection of popular songs from their time that extend into the memories of the viewers. It is a funny film. a tender film, a tour de force of acting by some very fine actors, and a memory trip that is wroth repeating with some frequency, like opening the old photo album. It has staying power. Grady Harp",The Big Chill
16,Mr-Fusion,"Probably not timeless, but still accessible",7,18 April 2016,"On paper, ""The Big Chill"" doesn't seem like my kind of movie at all. I'm no baby boomer (of which this movie so finely targets) so I won't be waxing nostalgic along with any of these characters. Which is the whole point when you really think about it. What the hell would I know about having a midlife crisis in the materialistic '80s? And yet, I was hooked. For one thing, this is one hell of an ensemble cast each one somehow making unrelatable material very watchable. And you come away from this feeling like these people have undergone something profound over one weekend and come out the other end stronger than ever. There's humor, drama, and great performances throughout.Oddly engrossing.7/10",The Big Chill
17,JamesHitchcock,Hippies Turned Yuppies,7,5 March 2010,"When I was a student at Cambridge in the early eighties, shortly before ""The Big Chill"" came out, a friend of mine had a poster on his wall entitled ""Woodstock Tenth Anniversary Reunion"". (The actual anniversary had taken place in August 1979, not long before we went up). The joke was that those attending the reunion were all middle-class professional types, smartly dressed in lounge suits with well-trimmed short hair. This poster exemplified the way in which my generation saw the baby boomers, twentysomething hippies turned thirtysomething yuppies. Those who still retained their hippie idealism were mercilessly derided as being at least ten years behind the times. (And derided not only by Cambridge students but also by the likes of B. A. Robertson, in his satirical song ""Kool in the Kaftan""). ""The Big Chill"" takes a rather more charitable look at the problems facing those idealists from the 1960s who tried to retain their idealism during the conservative Reagan years of the early 1980s. It features a group of old college friends from the University of Michigan who are reunited after fifteen years. The event which reunites them is the death of Alex, one of the group, who committed suicide while staying at the home of his friends Harold and Sarah. An impromptu reunion occurs as the old friends gather for Alex's funeral. The precise reasons why Alex killed himself are not spelled out- he did not leave a suicide note- but as the movie progresses we realise that he had become disillusioned with the course his life had taken. (He was a brilliant scientist, but had dropped out of the academic life to become a social worker). His friends also come to realise this, and the realisation prompts them to consider the paths their own lives have taken. Most of the group were involved in the counterculture of the 1960s and the peace movement or other forms of radical politics, but most are now living much more conservative, middle-class lifestyles. Harold is a business executive and his wife Sarah a doctor; they live in an elegant antebellum home in the South. Sam, a one-time radical, has now become a Hollywood actor closely based upon Tom Selleck, down to the moustache. (While watching the film I assumed that Selleck himself was playing the part; it was only when I saw the cast-list that I realised it was actually Tom Berenger). Karen is also now living an affluent lifestyle but is feeling dissatisfied with her husband Richard (who was not one of the college group). Michael, once a radical journalist, now works for the apolitical, celebrity-obsessed ""People Magazine"". Nick, a Vietnam War veteran, has now become a drug dealer. Apart from their friend's suicide, the question which haunts the group is what became of their youthful idealism? Contrary to what one might have expected, the film does not take a straightforward ""radicalism good, conservatism bad"" line. A key scene comes when Nick nearly gets himself arrested by badmouthing the local policeman. Harold, a personal friend of the officer, manages to smooth things out, but then berates Nick for his rudeness and stupidity. To Nick, who still subscribes to the sixties idea that all cops are ""pigs"" , this may seem like a sellout to the enemy, but I suspect that most of the audience will side with Harold who realises that some of his contemporaries have difficulty in distinguishing between idealism and childishness. ""The Big Chill"" has something in common with another movie from the early eighties, Barry Levinson's ""Diner"" from 1981, which also deals with a reunion of a group of former classmates, although that film is a period piece set in 1959 and the characters are rather younger, being in their twenties rather than their thirties. What the two films have in common is that both are excellent examples of ensemble acting.This was the second film of its director Lawrence Kasdan (his first was the very different neo-noir thriller ""Body Heat"") and it starred a number of actors, such as William Hurt and Kevin Kline, who were to become regulars in Kasdan's movies. , (Kevin Costner, originally cast as Alex, was edited out of the final version, but also went on to become a Kasdan regular). There are too may good performances to list them all, but special mentions must go to Kline as Harold, Glenn Close as Sarah and Meg Tilly as Alex's strange, unworldly younger girlfriend Chloe. One question much discussed on this board is whether the film is ""dated"". Leaving aside trivial questions of fashion (even in the eighties Tom Berenger's hairstyle must have looked very seventies), I think that it is ""dated"", but only in the narrow, limited sense that it deals with cultural phenomena such as the sixties counterculture which were very much of their own era. In a wider sense it is not dated because it deals with timeless issues such as love, friendship and the challenge of staying true to one's youthful ideals in later life. (Another eighties film on this theme, although in my view a less successful one, is Fred Schepisi's ""Plenty""). I felt that the film was occasionally slow-moving, with too great an emphasis on talk over action. I also wondered whether it might not have been improved by keeping Costner's scenes to allow us to see what sort of a person Alex was and why his death had such a traumatic impact on his friends. Overall, however, I felt that it was a very watchable film, and often a moving one- one that could be watched for pleasure not only by those who are too young to remember the sixties but even those who are too young to remember the eighties. 7/10",The Big Chill

19,StevePulaski,Needs more of a reason for the audience to care other than a catchy soundtrack,5,15 September 2015,"The Big Chill opens with Harold Cooper (Kevin Kline) and his wife Sarah (Glenn Close) receiving a phone call telling them their friend Alex has just committed suicide. At the subsequent funeral, Harold and Sarah reconnect with their friends from University of Michigan, including Sam (Tom Berenger), a successful actor, Nick (William Hurt), a Vietnam War veteran, Karen (JoBeth Williams), the dissatisfied and frustrated wife to Richard (Don Galloway), Meg (Mary Kay Place), a real estate attorney, Michael (Jeff Goldblum), a womanizing jokester, and Chloe (Meg Tilly), Alex's girlfriend.Following Alex's burial, Harold, much to Sarah's dismay, invites everyone over to their lakehouse for the weekend, where friendships rekindle and old memories are revisited, as the gaggle of formerly close friends decide to recount past experiences and elaborate on current ones in the face of tragedy. The film shows that certain calamity does indeed bring people together, and Alex's death has allowed for a bunch of old chums to address their friendship, and, inevitably, their relationship with Alex, in addition to seeing how they could've prevented Alex's suicide.The Big Chill is a film that winds up swooning people into thinking it's a fairly deep examination of grief and death, in addition to a cultural exploration, when it's really a film that suffers from its own glibness. The film has a lot of great music, which - in its organizations seems more like a 1970's era playlist - sometimes takes prominence over the film's characters. Being that there's little in the way of plot progression, the bulk of the film is left up to the characters, whom do an middling job at keeping the film going for the first half, at least.The problem with The Big Chill is the real film doesn't start until the last forty minutes. The real animosity and drama doesn't begin until all the small-talk is out of the way, and while that's maybe commonplace for these kinds of situations, it makes for a film with stifling inertness. During the first hour, the only remotely interesting character is Michael, thanks to his hilarious insights (""It's unfair that they throw you a great party when they know you're not going to be there,"" he states during Alex's funeral) and his wit, while the remainder come off as narcissistic brats with little offer.The music in The Big Chill is uniformly strong, recreating that nostalgic vibe of the 1960's and rekindling that spark of youthful idealism and the inspiration of hope and change. It also works to help the audience remind themselves of the time period in which these characters grew up, with hits from Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Temptations, and Aretha Franklin, all of whom adding to the feel of the 1960's encapsulated in a film set years after the decade of revolutionary change in America. The problem is that, with this assortment of terrific tracks and their placement in the film, The Big Chill feels like a mixtape or a playlist, inevitably spawning keen memories but doing little in the way of being substantial or memorable in a long-term sense.The remaining forty minutes, however, challenges screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan (who also serves as director) and Barbara Benedek, in addition to the characters they have penned for this film. The final act of the film allows for true emotions to bleed through, and the soundtrack to finally take a backseat to some real emotional honesty, in a film that has ostensibly been delaying it with recognizable golden oldies and chuckle-inducing dialog. The focus on pathos becomes much darker, and the eventual sympathy and sorrow for Alex's untimely death is finally questioned in a way that forces all the characters to be interrogated in some way.While The Big Chill develops into a more watchable film during its last forty minutes than it was in the preceding sixty, it's ultimately still a film too focused on glib revelations and momentarily insightful instances. It's the kind of film that, during its time and its era, it was seen as an intelligent and fascinating social critique, whereas in the present day, it's nothing more than a potential-filled drama that is nowhere near as relevant or as impacting as it was in its heyday (along with other films like Easy Rider).Starring: Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, Meg Tilly, JoBeth Williams.

20,lasttimeisaw,an enigma is better left in lacunae,7,8 September 2017,"A surprising Oscar's BEST PICTURE nominee, writer/director Lawrence Kasdan's sophomore feature THE BIG CHILL focuses on a weekend reunion of seven 30-something alumni of the University of Michigan, 15 years after leaving the ivory tower, but what convenes them together is anything but jovial, their friend Alex's shocking suicide. The overhanging question shrouds the cohort of eight, joined by Chloe, Alex's much younger girlfriend, is what is the reason behind Alex's given up on his life, but like Alex himself, whom we are not privileged to see in his physical form (Kevin Costner is cast as Alex but all his scenes with his facial appearance are left in the editing room), it is elusive and open-ended, it might be just as well a spur-of-the-moment decision out of depression. In lieu of solving the mystery, Kasdan takes in his stride to examine the sophisticated interrelations among our subjects, who begin to introspect their own feelings in the aftermath through gingerly disposed small talks and congenial interactions infrequently salted with discord and liaisons. Pivoted around a ballast of camaraderie, nothing egregiously dark will emerge to tickle a cynical mind, Sarah (a radiant and Oscar-nominated Glenn Close in the mode of a good wife/mother which in retrospect appears at a premium in her tracking record) admits that she had an affair with Alex, which unfortunately dampens their friendship, before marrying Harold (Kevin Kline, full of panache), the ultimate version of an understanding and competent husband, who has no qualms at the bidding of her wife to become an inseminator of Meg (Mary Kay Place, embodies the career woman stereotype with considerable pizazz and tizzy), who adopts a modern view of independence and plans to become a single mother of her own accord when the biological clock starts ticking. As per the likability quotient of their characters, in the descending order, the next-in-line is Karen (JoBeth Williams, a fine performance), a housewife forgoes her writing dreams to raise her children and gets bored with her stagnant marriage, the reunion tantalizingly rekindles her romance with her old admirer Sam (Tom Berenger, emits a refreshing air of forthright amiability and attractive unassumingness before being typecast in the villain compartment, for keeps), a well-known TV actor in L.A., divorced but sagacious enough not to wreck a family just for the old time's sake (after a mutually desired consummation, of course). Then the only new blood, Chloe (a lissom Meg Tilly channeling a less convincing orbit wobbling between a barmy nymphet and a post-traumatic soul), takes a liking to Nick (William Hurt, tangibly tackling the most complex character here with searing precision), a Porsche-riding, pill-popping Vietnam veteran who has no place called home and stigmatized by impotence, whose defeatist outlook cuts through the sweeping but bland melancholia like a scalpel, before receding to its residing harbor in the well-intentioned but anodyne ending. Finally, Michael (a jaunty Jeff Goldblum) is a People Magazine's writer who seeks both a new career opportunity and some carnal dalliance, falls between those two stools at length, nevertheless his can-do spirit is always in full swing to bring exuberance. A cracking ensemble piece punctuated by a potpourri of hit parade ear-worms, THE BIG CHILL enthralls viewers with its fabricated spontaneity, palpable warmth and liberating candor, yet as a matter of fact, there is a discerning aftertaste apropos of the elephant-in-the-room: ""Who is this enigmatic, gone but not forgotten Alex and what drives him to his undoing?"", after all, is it a tactful circumvention as an enigma is better left in lacunae or a flagrant glossing-over in favor of something less perturbing? The jury is out, seemly.",The Big Chill

22,thesar-2,When Will AZ Get a Big Chill?,8,3 March 2013,"In a shorten work week's timeframe, a friend recommended The Big Chill two times. In both incidents, the reason he stated it was good was because it was the best role he's seen from Kevin Costner.Spoiler alert, Kevin Costner's Alex is dead prior to the movie's opening and pretty much all we see of Costner is his surgically sewn up wrists obviously showing the cause of death. Damn, my friend must really hate Costner.But, that's not the whole reason he liked it, and I can see why.The ""takes-place-over-a-weekend"" movie reunites long-distant friends of the past after said Alex takes his life. During this talkative and exploring one's feelings weekend, there's a bunch of drug usage, alcohol consumption, sexual exploring, hot topics (of the 1983 era, that is) and some of the most wittiest dialogue and revolutions I've heard.That's pretty much the basic premise but listening to them isn't so basic. The script still seems fresh today, almost 30-years later and this is the first time I've experienced it. It helps most of the fantastic humor comes from Jeff Goldblum, whom I've always adored and found hilarious. But, that's not to take away from the other all-stars, a pre-2001's-Ocean's Eleven collage of actors, if you will.Both Kevin Kline and William Hurt – another couple of actors I admire, did great, Meg Tilly was fantastic in her character's shoes and an all-time favorite of mine, Glenn Close, who appeared to have the most depth of all the characters combined, did excellent. An honorable mention goes to an actor whom I never got into, but did a surprisingly good job: Tom Berenger. Again, this is not to say the remaining cast wasn't great and they did their jobs accordingly.So, we have these old friends together again, following a very bad incident and let's watch them learn, explore, communicate, attempt to work things out and learn from this. It's a deliberately paced film and felt real. These actors and this script felt genuine. And damn what a kickass soundtrack! (I can't forget that positive.)It's a high recommendation, especially to those who've lost someone close to such a tragedy.** - Yeah, I'm not going into my own feelings of suicide, because, mercifully, I haven't lost someone close to this kind of end. I don't feel its right to judge someone's decision on it and I will honestly conclude my feelings with the aforementioned word used: tragedy. It is one, above all else, regardless if I was or was not within reach of someone taking their own life.",The Big Chill
23,gbill-74877,Always makes me smile,8,17 May 2021,"""Nick, I no longer know how to handle myself stoned.""
""You don't have to handle yourself with us.""The Big Chill has a group of college friends from the 1960's coming together again because one of their circle has committed suicide. It explores the pain of this loss, but more so, the fading of youthful idealism, losing touch with friends, and moving on into more conventional, middle-aged lives. Ideals are compromised and cynicism begins to set in, hence the title, and these were timely themes for those in the 1980's looking back at the 60's.It's a fine ensemble cast, with some fantastic work from William Hurt, Glenn Close, and Jeff Goldblum in particular (side note, check out Glenn Close shaking her thing 38 years before Da'Butt at the 2021 Oscars). The film plays the sadness off pretty lightly, helped considerably by a soundtrack filled with classic 60's pop and Motown, though there are truly poignant moments when someone touches a nerve, or they reflect on where they are in life. The moment that Hurt's character questions the depths of their friendship in an uncomfortable way was incredibly real and powerful, and overall, the banter between them always feels natural.I can identify with the line ""I feel I was at my best when I was with you people,"" when reflecting back on people in my life, even if my memory may be a little distorted, and I think this resonated with others too. Some of the film feels canned and the various hooking up got a little much, but for me, it always makes me smile, and works.",The Big Chill
24,g-bodyl,"Pleasant, Feel-Good Drama!",9,5 January 2014,"The Big Chill is a relatively charming film that is all about friendship and the meaning of friendship. This film is more for adult audiences, but I feel like any person of any age could enjoy this film if they understand the deeper meanings of friendship. This film may be a bit talky, but this is never short of interesting as we listen to strong dialog, attentive characters, and a killer soundtrack with many awesome songs.Lawrence Kasdan's film is about a group of college friends who reunite after the death of their dear friend, Alex. These friends spend the weekend together recollecting their memories from the 60's despite living in the 80's.The acting is really good because of the strong cast. A cast of Kevin Kline, Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, and William Hurt really can't go wrong. We get to know each character very well and we can connect or relate with them. I can classify this film as a character study because the film focuses on strong, central characters.Overall, this is a very good drama that can be both sad and feel-good. Through the bonds of friendship and sex, we come to realize these characters are meant to be friends and how strong each and every single individual is. This film can be a little preachy at times, but nothing wrong with some very strong dialog. I rate this film 9/10.",The Big Chill

He does it at the summer home of a successful duo, Harold (Kevin Kline) a rising running shoe manufacturer and Sarah (Glenn Close) an MD. As Alex was their friend from college days at U of Mich, they were helping him get back on his feet. Now, at the funeral, more friends poor in. Sam (Tom Berenger) is a television star, Meg (Mary Kay Place) is a fine lawyer, Michael (Jeff Goldblum) writes for People Magazine, and Karen (JoBeth Williams) is a housewife with two small boys. Only Nick (William Hurt) seems somewhat adrift, as he failed to complete a doctorate in psychology and is suspected to be a seller of drugs. All of them are grieving for Alex but, as they gather after the funeral, they begin to pick apart how far they have come in the last ten years or so. Gone are the lofty ideals of the Sixties and reality has set in. For example, Meg wanted to be a public defender until she found out how guilty most of her clients were! Now, she has opted for a more lucrative career in real estate law. In short, most of the clan has soberly fallen into jobs and choices that support a typical lifestyle. They are somewhat freaked out by Alex's young girlfriend, Chloe (Meg Tilly) for she has a more cynical view than these Idealists had when they were her age. In a long weekend together, they grieve, reveal secrets, and try to make sense of their existence. What a concept! This classic movie is still a wonderful experience. The cast is superb, with all of them delivering tour de force turns. Also lofty is the script's general scrutiny of living day to day and needing your friends to pull you through. The soundtrack is likewise wonderful with powerful choices of the best of the 60's. Add on great costumes, scenery, and Kasdan's fine direction and the result is mesmerizing. The Big Chill is big on entertainment and enrichment so get it, get it.",The Big Chill
26,atlasmb,Relevant And Rewarding,9,23 April 2021,"Noted for its prominent soundtrack of sixties music, ""The Big Chill"" is an ensemble performance that struck an emotional note with many viewers in the eighties. Its story is simple: a group of college friends reunite for the funeral of a common friend who died by suicide. During their time together, they re-evaluate their lives, especially in terms of the idealism they had when attending the University of Michigan during the tumultuous sixties.The cast is notably strong, including William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum, Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Tom Berenger, Mary Kay Place, Meg Tilly, and JoBeth Williams. Glenn Close, in particular, shows a wide range of emotions during the reunion, though sometimes she Is MIA in grief while the others congregate and commiserate.The most iconic scene is probably the kitchen cleanup scene to the strains of ""Ain't Too Proud to Beg"". But director/writer Lawrence Kasdan includes many moments of real reckoning for these foundering friends who don't know whether to recapture past moments of youth or to somehow reconcile their current lives with forgotten values.Roger Ebert wrote that ""there's no payoff and (the film) doesn't lead anywhere. I thought at first that was a weakness of the movie. There also is the possibility that it's the movie's message."" That definitely is part of the message. But there are moments of forgiveness, salvation and real connection forged between some of the characters.Also, it should be noted that these characters represent only a portion of the young adult population of the sixties. These were self-disenfranchised radicals, really---progressives who not only questioned every convention, but rejected the norms of society whole cloth, putting all their faith in the concept that idealism itself can justify any notion. There were others. And it is possible to question all conventions in a quest to develop one's own paradigms and principles, perhaps to create a hybrid of the established and the revolutionary.Kasdan has created a film that is enjoyable to watch and relevant to many who eventually confront the real responsibilities of adult living. Those who like this film might want to check out another Kasdan effort that deserves attention: ""Grand Canyon"".",The Big Chill

This was Kasdan's second stint as writer-director after the success of ""Body Heat,"" but he falls short of his lofty goals. Apparently he was going for an incisive drama about the meaning of life. The characters broach heavy topics but don't get below the surface, typically copping out of such conversations with a joke. Hence, there is a lot of talking but little is said. The all-star ensemble is impressive, but it's hard to warm up to the characters, who are smug yuppies. More thawing needed.",The Big Chill

Sarah is heartbroken over the death of their friend Alex and hides her grief in the shower suggesting that she and the deceased had a past. Karen and Sam were apparently involved back in college , Meg wants to have a baby with one of the male attendees and Michael is planning to start up a business and is seeking investors. Nick is bemoaning the fact that he is no longer able to ""perform"" due to a war injury and leans on drugs for solace.

Nick gets pulled over high by the local cop but Harold is able to explain the situation and gets Nick off. The gang frolics and plays over the two day weekend making videos and watching college football and exchanging pleasantries and regrets over what has occurred. Oddly enough all are rich and successful except for Chloe and evidently the deceased Alex who was living with Harold and Sarah while renovating an old house for himself and Chloe.The ensemble cast works well together having been cooped together up for weeks prior to the shoot.

Kasdan does deliver a few pointed observations that fall somewhere between sarcasm and wit but his continued saving grace to relieve the torpor of some scenes is to inject the film's soul and energy; the music score into them rather than trail off in whiny hissy fits by this self absorbed crowd. His ensemble cast performs adequately and allows him to keep a decent pace as he moves from dynamic to dynamic with characters displaying a benign self righteous vacuity but not before they are redeemed at denouement with one of the ""beautiful people"" (Glenn Close) showing us what peace love and groovy is all about along with everyone at the breakfast table free of funk off on the right path.

I figured that since I'm now older myself I might be able to identify with the people and their experiences in the film and get some self-awareness out of it, but the only thing I realized is that I had a good reason for not remembering this. Oh, the idea is promising enough: a mutual friend dies of suicide, and so after the funeral a group of now-grown ""anything goes in the '80s"" yuppies gather together in a house for the weekend to supposedly re-evaluate their own lives and try to gain a little self-realization (if not self respect). Problem is, none of these characters are very interesting or likable, and nothing is really going on here, neither intellectually nor physically to hold your attention. Unless you count that I've always had a thing for the dark-haired Jobeth Williams, kind of thought Glenn Close was pretty alluring in an offbeat sort of way, and enjoyed watching the pretty Meg Tilly doing her leg exercises.A real nothing of a film, despite the infusion of a kick-ass soundtrack of classic '60s tunes and the bumping of hips around the kitchen to the sounds of ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg"". *1/2 out of ****",The Big Chill

At least they never said it to me,"" says Richard (Galloway) the outsider of a group of college buddies now in their thirties. He talks about adulthood as if it's a rueful inevitability; less a right of passage than a chore. The rest of the ensemble cast of The Big Chill seem to be fighting what Richard has accepted. For better or worse, they all seem to be stuck; trying desperately to keep the torch of youth lit.The Big Chill starts with Harold (Kline) and Sarah Cooper (Close) preparing for bed in their idyllic South Carolina home. Sarah answers a phone call and is informed that their friend Alex killed himself in the bathtub of their vacation home. At the funeral, the couple's old University of Michigan friends reunite and decide to spend the weekend reminiscing. Among them is Sam (Berenger), a notable TV actor; Michael (Goldblum), a magazine journalist; Meg (Place), a single real estate attorney; Nick (Hurt), a war veteran with a cocaine addiction; Chloe (Tilly), Alex's much younger girlfriend and finally Karen (Williams) and Richard, an unhappily married couple. A lot has happened since the group had graduated and a lot can happen over the course of a weekend.While thematically very different than director Lawrence Kasdan's freshman effort Body Heat (1981), The Big Chill does show a similar affinity to character over story structure and pat resolutions. All the friends are brought to life by a stellar ensemble cast of talented actors. Mind you, there are no showy performances that demand Academy attention (though Glenn Close was nominated for Best Supporting Actress). Each player does their part to populate a delicate and bittersweet nostalgia trip that drifts like a raft down a rolling river. These are people you know, or at the very least, still images of who those people you know, used to be.Beneath the grieving, the sexual tension, the retrospect and the admittedly catchy jukebox soundtrack there's a deep sense of existential ennui that dominates the frame like a heavy fog. Today audiences will likely appreciate the characterizations but audiences at the time knew very well that these distinctive personalities are not just lamenting the death of their friend but the spirit of the 60's. Let's not forget that their alma mater was a counter-cultural Mecca that hosted the writers of the Port Huron Statement, the entourage of John Sinclair and free Sunday concerts at West Park. As time passed the hippies of the 60's became the yuppies of the 80's with the characters of The Big Chill are at once reminded that they bought in and the never seen Alex checked out.All that said however, The Big Chill for all it's understated emotion still collects the mephitis of popular American nostalgia. It's the kind of nostalgia that can simultaneously give Norman Rockwell paintings their cumulative heft yet give the most troublesome spots of Forrest Gump (1994) their chintzy glibness. You can't help but think by the time the credits roll, the characters have settled comfortably back into lives of quiet desperation yet self-congratulating themselves for ""maturing"". Only Nick seems to be bending in anyway towards the dulling flicker of dying idealism. But instead of the bitterness that was honestly realized in Return of the Secaucus 7 (1979) we get the upbeat vibes of ""Jeremiah was a Bullfrog"".All-in-all, The Big Chill is a decent film with fully realized characters worth following for an hour or two. While watching I wondered what would be my generation's Woodstock? Do we have any political organizations that explode with the controversial fervor of the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) or any musical idols that compare to Bob Dylan or Jimi Hendrix? Will our desire to create a more just and verdant world be fully realized or will we fall inattentive, indignant and distracted by new shoes and a few fond memories.",The Big Chill

So I'll admit that it was cool seeing graduates of the University of Michigan, and even more cool watching as they were losing in the football game to Michigan State. Other than that, I struggled to relate to The Big Chill. I guess this is where I admit the dark truth that will make me a pathetic character to everyone...I never had friends like the ones depicted here. I didn't form these kinds of strong bonds with people at any point in my life, and I can't imagine congregating for an old classmate's funeral and discussing how my life has gone. I don't know, does anybody have a friend group like this in real life? Either way, that's all there really is to this movie. It's not a story in the traditional sense, but a look at how people change and how certain aspects of them always remain the same.There are moments of good comedy and solid drama in The Big Chill. Whether I have friends like this or not, I can certainly appreciate the camaraderie between them. There were a number of little subplots that are woven throughout the film, and I was interested in about half of them. At least one of them creeped me out, but I suppose that's my own personal prudish nature. The biggest things to compliment about The Big Chill are the soundtrack and the cast. In both areas they spared no expense because these are memorable tunes, and great actors. I loved revisiting all the songs and singing along with some of my favorites. Likewise, I appreciated the A-list acting talent in the film which elevated a number of scenes. My only complaint in the entire cast was the choice to have Kevin Kline fumble his way through that southern accent. It was so off-and-on that I couldn't understand the point. In summary, The Big Chill is a decent drama, but not one that delved deep enough into anything real to impact me. I'm glad I've seen it now, but I don't think I'd watch it again.",The Big Chill
37,ODDBear,A great movie,10,26 December 2005,"The Big Chill is, as described by many critics, an irresistible trip down memory lane. The characters here compare their sixties ideals with the harsh reality of their lives in the eighties and think about how much simpler life was at one point when they all felt they had the world at their feet. Becoming a grown up in a radically changing world, full of rebellion and optimism only to wake up years later and find that their impact on everything doesn't amount to much.Each character in The Big Chill is representative of how they cope with that reality. They all come together when one of them has committed suicide and they spend a weekend remembering past times and discuss the present. The suicide victim, who's obviously the most extreme example, is a man who couldn't find his way in the cold hard world, where your opinions and ideals don't add up to a hill of beans and you find out that you're most likely not going to accomplish anything of what you dreamed you would. Some people in The Big Chill have adapted to these new times quite nicely while others haven't.When I watch The Big Chill I sometimes wish I had grown up in these times, when the world was a little more innocent and naive and blind idealism ruled. Growing up in the 90's I feel the best of times had already passed. But really that's just one way of thinking that the grass is always greener on the other side, perhaps in years to come another film like The Big Chill will depict the reality of the 90's and show how the world has changed since then and then I'll feel all nostalgic. The Big Chill shows me that you don't have to be a product of the sixties to fully enjoy the film and get the point the film is making. That's a rare thing in a film, it's quite universal in it's message and it becomes a trip down memory lane no matter when you grew up; you find similarities in many things here.The Big Chill has it all; great story, great actors, great music; it's just a great movie.",The Big Chill

Kasden started his directorial career with a nice tribute to film noir movie in Body Heat but then for some reason felt that every movie he would make from then on would be a large ensemble cast feature like Silverado, Wyatt Earp, The Accidental Tourist, I Love You To Death and Mumford. It reminds me of those old Mickey Rooney movies when Mickey says, Hey gang, let's put on a show! I'm surprised with Kasden's love for big casts that he never put out a musical. The Big Chill stars Tom Berenger, Glen Close, Jeff Goldbloom, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, Meg Tilly, Jo Beth Williams and a few others in this yuppie yawner. Lawrence Kasden and Barbara Benedek were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Screenplay for this film as was Glen Close for Best Supporting Actress. Incredibly the film was also nominated for Best Picture. It didn't win any awards which spared the audience of having the entire cast come on stage to accept. This movie has some good moments and a good cast of ascending stars and a good soundtrack of 60's tunes but it goes nowhere, the characters accomplish nothing and you don't really care about the characters after spending a couple of hours with them. Alex was the only one to kill himself but perhaps a mass suicide would have worked better and spared us from this self-absorbed inspiration to the TV show 30 Something. I would give it a 5.5 out of 10.",The Big Chill
39,gbheron,Ensemble Acting at it's Best,9,3 February 2001,"""The Big Chill"" is about my peers. When first released in 1983, I, like the characters, was in my early thirties, a former rebellious collegian from the '60s. After a decade in the work-a-day world, being a family man and raising babies, watching ""The Big Chill"" was like a fantastic time machine and took me back to places long forgotten. It really connected with me on a visceral level and I loved it. Now, almost twenty years later, I've watched ""The Big Chill"" again. Same effect? Not exactly, although a lot of this may be due to the effect of viewing any movie a second time. My views of the 60s are not so gilded as they were then either. ""The Big Chill"" is still a very good movie; you have to love it for the ensemble acting. So many of the actors in the movie went on to have respected careers in the 80s and 90s. It's one of those rare movies like ""American Graffiti"" and ""Diner"" that served as a launch pad for acting careers.  And the soundtrack is perfect, capturing the breadth of late '60s pop music. I really wish Kasdan had done with these characters, what Updike did with his ""Rabbit"" novels, that is, show the characters at ten year intervals through their lives. This is one of the better movies of this type and is highly recommended even for the gen-x'ers.",The Big Chill
40,gab-14712,A Beautiful Ensemble Film!,9,17 October 2019,"In my humble opinion, 1983's The Big Chill is a classic. Up to this point, I have seen the movie twice. Each time I have viewed the movie, I was affected in ways I did not think I would have been. I find that funny because both times I have seen this film, I am not even close to the age of the characters. As a man still in my 20's, obviously I haven't had to ask the question, ""What is it like to be in your 30's""? But the theme of reminiscing about your past, about your college days is very prevalent to me. College shaped my life in an enormous way and five years after graduation, not a day go by as I think about these experiences I collected. I guess ten years down the line, I will be like the characters as seen in the movie. Also, this film is about friendship, love, and sex. Very important themes for any rational human. What I truly liked is how Lawrence Kasdan's script and the performances from the ensemble cast were able to effectively use these themes to the greatest effect.Lawrence Kasdan directed the film based off his original screenplay about a bunch of friends who attended the University of Michigan together in the 1960's. These group of friends shared many of the same ideologies, politics, and thoughts. After they graduated, they pursued their own separate, successful careers although they remained in touch for the most part. It's now 1983 and they all reunited thanks to the unfortunate happenstance of a suicide from one of their friends. Being in their mid to late 30's, their ideas about life and the world changed. The group of friends along with Alex's younger girlfriend, Chloe (Meg Tilly) stay at Sarah (Glenn Close) and Harold's (Kevin Kline) house. As these friends get to know each other once more, they just might see how much they have changed as individuals.What do all of these names have in common? Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum, Tom Berenger, JoBeth Williams, Meg Tilly, and Mary Kay Place? They were all of the fantastic actors who made up this ensemble. This movie truly works as an ensemble, not as a singular character piece. Each character had their moments to shine, but they worked together well as one collective group. Honestly, I felt like a part of their circle. Watching these actors interact with each other was so much fun as well as emotional. They all asked relevant questions, such as what is it like to be in their 30's, can we still have children, what should we have changed about the past, and so forth. Many of these actors, while not entirely at the height of their careers yet, would go on to have fantastic careers. Glenn Close was this film's MVP (and she was nominated for an Academy Award), but William Hurt is a close second for me.Another reason why this film affected me the way it did was because of the killer soundtrack. I am an old soul, so 60's rock and roll and R&B is my jam. Even though the setting is the 1980's, these characters grew up in the 1960's where their radical personalities were able to jive out to this music. Smokey Robinson, The Rolling Stones, The Temptations, and the list goes on. This film might just be able to boast the title of the best soundtrack of all time. I really mean it!I did not pay attention to any reviews and did minimal research before watching the movie. The cast is what attracted me to the picture. I was pretty shocked to see how many mediocre reviews this film has. The overall scores are not terrible, but I consider this to be one of the best films of 1983. It does not have much of a narrative and it can be overly talky, but I am a nostalgic person. No matter if its 1983 or 2019 or 1968, all generations goes through the same themes of friendship, love, and nostalgia.The Big Chill spoke to me in ways many films do not. The music, the dialogue, the acting performances are all great. Glenn Close and William Hurt lead the fantastic ensemble. The film is authentic and pure. It may not have a point or lead to anywhere earth-shattering, but watching friends come together to share their joy, sorrows, and pain is always fun to watch.My Grade: A",The Big Chill
41,Pedro_H,Well acted and memorable - if a little clever-clever and convenient.,8,29 February 2004,"Seven  former college friends meet up for a funeral of a former friend and lament about what might have been and how their liberal ideals have been compromised.While this is one of my all-time top 200 movies - and one of the best films of the 1980's  - I am still not sure why it works or why I actually like it! Sometimes you look at a film and wish you could walk out of the audience and in to the on-screen world, but I don't really want to here.
*Smallest possible spoiler*Someone is dead (a before-famous Kevin Costner actually - but you wouldn't know it from the outline shots!) but does anybody really care (on screen or off)? Suicide seems to be the reason, but don't come looking for definitive answers as to why. He left no note.I was expecting some dazzling revelation to this puzzle as the ""grand climax"" - but we don't get it as the movie only wants explore the hippy chattering classes' dream that has turned bad (although only in the punishment-of-luxury version of ""bad"") using the dead, and soon to be buried, Alex as a throw-people-together device. Curious in the casual use of drugs and even more curious in the mention of a character having taken cocaine - something we never actually saw. While this may have been a cutting room decision we are (from 1983) at the point where drug taking is seen as the norm? There are no voices against and I wouldn't want to list the drug users (soft or hard) from the non drug users. It is a ""non issue"" says this film.The more you reverse engineer this product the more you realise why some of it is false. Bring any group together and you create families - if only for a small period of time: Mum, dad, kids and uncle figures. People work together here (watch the table being cleared by team work), but they are not equals and their hippy-dippy sharing-and-caring days are clearly over.Tom Berringer even has his own TV series that seems to embarrass him. Why? Because it is a kind of cod Magnum Private Eye programme that shows him leaping in to sports cars and bedding women? Do you think he didn't beg for the role, celebrate after he was given it, use it to seduce women? And let us not forget the money. ""I always try and put something of value in to every episode"" he says at one point. So he writes the scripts as well does he? Pure nonsense. Ironically the film's greatest strengths are that it doesn't have a climax and it doesn't really have a point. Nothing is solved, not even Alex's death, and their world has been reduced to well paying jobs and pseudo-intellectual jaw-jaw over the kitchen table.They are secretly miserable people, leading secretly miserable lives from which the only respite is dope, sex and jerky dancing to soul greats. Soul, now that is an interesting word...",The Big Chill
42,Tito-8,"Great cast, great music, great entertainment",9,19 May 1999,"It took a little while for me to really get into the film, but in the end, I was hooked.  Once I got to know a little about each of the characters, I found it hard not to care about each and every one of them.  Yes, it was dialogue-heavy, but once I liked the people on-screen, the conversations became rather engrossing.  Even if lots of talking doesn't sound too appealing, I still think you should give it a look, because it isn't too often that a film has a cast that is so hugely talented.  And of course, this film has one of the greatest soundtracks in movie history, and these songs seem to fit the mood perfectly.  I had high expectations for this film, and although it wasn't quite what I had expected, this film did not disappoint.",The Big Chill
43,oneloveall,Tasty ingredients don't make a complete feast,6,17 March 2008,"With a simply superb funeral introduction, it would be able to be fooled into thinking this movie the classic some make to be. For an 80's flick the audience-friendly, adult get-together plays out like The Breakfast Club for yuppies, exuding some memorable energy at points but misfiring just as clearly at others.Unfortunately, when it appears Kasdan has managed to authentically capture this old group of friends admirably, besides for throwing in occasional juicy tidbits of underplayed drama, the arc begins falling around midpoint and never manages to recuperate steam.Some of the lines feel extremely foolish by now, but the chemistry between this group remains.",The Big Chill
44,TheOtherFool,Loved it,8,9 April 2004,"Lawrence Kasdan wrote, directed and executive-produced this the same year he co-wrote Star Wars VI... must have been a busy year for him!This is a great 80's drama with a group of friends coming back to their home-town for a funeral after one of their group killed himself. In the weekend they think about why he did it, and how they are doing in their own lifes. There's also some old, not-forgotten love hanging in the air, and some other relationship-related subjects (that's sex people!).Great performances all around makes it particularly fun to watch, despite the heavy subject. Hurt shines as drug addict but Goldblum steals the show as writer for People Magazine. But there are no weak actors in this one (even Close wasn't annoying, now that's a first!).8/10.",The Big Chill
45,Isaac5855,A Winning Comedy-Drama Backed by One of the Best Soundtracks Ever!,9,18 July 2006,"1983's THE BIG CHILL is one of those beautifully crafted and wonderfully acted films that is so ingratiating that I can watch it over and over and never tire of it. Director Lawrence Kasdan hits the bullseye in this alternately hilarious and moving variation on the earlier RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN. This film follows the reunion of a group of friends who went to college together, who have gathered for the funeral of their mutual friend, Alex, who has committed suicide. The original screenplay included scenes with Alex, who was played by Kevin Costner, but, in a stroke of genius, it was decide to delete all of the Alex scenes in the film, lending a wonderful air of mystery to the character of Alex and allowing the audience more input as to why Alex decided to end his life. Alex's friends are Harold Cooper (Kevin Kline), who now owns a shoe store franchise and his doctor-wife, Sarah (Glenn Close), who also serve as our hosts ; Michael (Jeff Goldblum), a writer for PEOPLE magazine; Meg (Mary Kay Place)an attorney who wants to have a baby; Sam (Tom Berenger) an actor with his own TV show who misses the simple life; Karen (JoBeth Williams), a restless housewife who would really like to be a writer and Nick (William Hurt) a drug dealer who would like to be anything else. Also thrown into the mix is Chloe (Meg Tilly) Alex's girlfriend, who knows a completely different Alex than his friends do. This gathering of old and new friends sets the stage for some long-dormant resentments to bubble to the surface and for some long buried passions to be re-ignited. Kasdan has a sharp directorial eye and a flawless ear for dialogue with one of the most quotable screenplays ever and it is all set to a soundtrack of the greatest music from the 1960's ever compiled for a movie soundtrack. The cast is perfection...Close received a Best Supporting Actress nomination but the entire cast works at the same level and to honor one without honoring the ensemble wouldn't have been right. This is the ultimate ensemble piece and it works just about perfectly. Anyway you slice it, an instant classic.",The Big Chill
46,bigverybadtom,What Exactly Was The Point?,5,22 April 2018,"I've heard of the movie and finally found and saw it. I knew what the idea was-a group of former college friends coming together for the funeral of another who had committed suicide, and they stay for the weekend at the summer home of one of them. They speculate on why he committed suicide, talk about their past idealism, what they are doing now and their unhappiness with it, make cynical comments about other people, plot to have sex with each other, plot to break up with their partners-or not. One of them is even a major actor who is a clone of Tom Selleck, with a ""Magnum, P. I.""-type television show.The problem is, the characters are basically uninteresting and unsympathetic, with their past idealism evidently transient and shallow. One woman who had tried to be a criminal lawyer found her clients detestable, and went into corporate law, one is a Vietnam veteran who uses drugs (but doesn't seem to have been traumatized by any combat experiences), one is obsessed with telling the others of how his small company is about to be bought out by a big corporation and how his friends could make money off this (though he is aware that his saying this is highly illegal), the actor admits he left his wife and children because he was bored with them. Only the host couple come out of this favorably, with their decision not to break up and with the husband rebuking the Vietnam veteran for having mouthed off to a visiting policeman, who had previously saved the couple from criminals.An annoying factor is the constant playing of late 1960's songs, evidently to remind us that these people grew up in that era. Okay, we get the point, there's no need to pound that into our heads. Passable as a soap opera, but this film clearly does not live up to its high reputation.",The Big Chill
47,dansview,Not Sure What it Wants to Be,7,30 August 2014,"As one reviewer here mentioned already, there is not much talent in choosing extremely popular music hits to fit an era-specific film. I would be more intrigued if they chose obscure songs from the time or even psychedelic instrumental music from the 60's.It's like if you did a movie about people who went to college in the 80's and the soundtrack was Duran Duran, Madonna, and Michael Jackson. Big Deal. I never understood why people compliment soundtracks that are just some mega-hits playing in the background to fit the era depicted in a film.Why did they all go to University of Michigan? Only one character now lives in Michigan. Some were raised in the South, and others generic. Where did William Hurt's character drive in from in an old Porsche? I've seen this film several times and I did not see Kevin Costner in any coffin. It must have been a quick shot. But I'm pretty sure he is way too young to have gone to college in the 60's.Congratulations to the writers and director for putting in some defense of conservatism. Two different characters explain the virtues of the conservative life and point out the childish self-indulgent nature underlying the 60's mentality.Why did Hurt's character go to Vietnam if they were all radicals? Did he get drafted? He had a Masters Degree. He would have been in college for the whole war. No one even mentions his army service, either to thank him or condemn him for it.Other than hearing about it in passing, there is no indication that Hurt and Williams' characters had been a couple in school. I saw little if any affection between them.I loved the scenery. I guess it was South Carolina or some such place.I don't like to see multiple adulteries depicted. But it was not necessarily condoning the acts, but rather saying that this is what those kinds of characters might do.When we watch a film, we need to remember that the film makers are not necessarily endorsing the actions of the characters they create. They are just making them do things that fit their personalities. It wouldn't be much of a movie if no one did anything wrong.I think the two conservative characters balanced the message of this film. Which is that the way to change the world is to take responsibility for yourself, your family, and your community. That doesn't entail simply protesting stuff or denouncing things. It consists of hard work, dedication,delayed gratification, and loyalty.Good dialogue overall, but they could have implemented a few deeper passages, like in the movie Network. Hence my title. It was like it wasn't sure if it wanted to be a lighthearted reunion picture, or make some deep statement about life. I think it was ultimately the first, with a little of the second.",The Big Chill
48,La Gremlin,"Heartwarming, and it's got a great soundtrack!",7,15 August 2001,I shudder to think of the day when I'll be able to *really* relate to this movie.  It's about some friends from college who haven't seen each other in many years.

On viewing it some 20 years later I'm struck by how smug & supercilious these characters all are, particularly Kline & Close. Were they supposed to be depicting such shallow vain self-satisfied characters? Or has time altered perspective? The platitudes spouted right & left that were amusing then are laughable at best now. And what would happen if all that great top-40 1960s & 1970s R&R background music was eliminated? What might have given this movie a more lasting edge (at least for me) is if the director had taken the running gag of the various characters performing for the found camcorder & used it as a general theme; that is have the whole film be a ""staged for the camcorder"" performance. Then this saturation of self-consciousness carryings-on might have been warranted.As always, fine performances by Hurt, Goldblum & Place. And a very lovely Meg Tilly.",The Big Chill
50,yris2002,an intelligent and sensitive script for a talented cast,8,15 June 2009,"Reunions of former college mates can be an enthusiastic, but also dramatic experience, mainly when you have shared with your now adult friends great ideals in a better and just world, and all those ideals have been abandoned in favour of professional careers and wealthy lives and, moreover, when the only mate who has faced the unfillable gap between the ideal and the real has just committed suicide and thus caused that same reunion. Single sense of more or less pretended personal self-fulfilment, but hiding a dramatic sense of disillusionment, is rendered through noteworthy dialogues: intelligent, witty, ironical, sensitive and deep. Each protagonist will have to take off his/her mask, and show himself/herself for what he/she is now: the easy and devouring enthusiasm of those, not so distant, at least chronologically, but mentally and emotionally buried times cannot be acted for long. The only form of consolation, a very significant one, actually, is the possibility to share this sense of disillusionment, and the understanding that the only way out of personal dramas is communing with others. Evidently, the actors, nowadays known as talented performers, but not so famous in 1983, are more than good. Not to mention the soundtrack, which contributes strongly to the emotional impact of the movie and makes one feel like rediscovering the great and out of time hits of the 60's, 70's.

The loss of a friend by suicide, and maybe the loss of the idealisim of our younger years. The soundtrack continued to stand out, and is a real killer. I would maybe just like to single out the character of Chloe, portrayed by Meg Tiilley. She is such a pleasing counter balance to the older, more, wounded characters. In fact she is the simplicity that they all pine for. I'm going to bump my rating up to 8/10.",The Big Chill
53,frankwiener,The Big Ice Box,3,18 March 2018,"Every time I write a negative review for IMDb, I have to brace myself for negative feedback, sometimes in extreme form. Here goes anyway.More than anything else, Kevin Kline running around the streets of Beaufort, South Carolina in teeny, tiny running shorts symbolizes this truly sad effort better than anything else. As a long distance runner for decades, even before this film was produced, I felt embarrassed for him every time he appeared in his skimpy outfit, which was much too often. Eventually, I became just as uncomfortable for everyone else connected to this movie, and it wasn't only because of Kevin Kline's ridiculously scanty running shorts. By the way, does anyone know why the running shoes were delivered for the entire group in the first place? I saw a few people playing touch football, but they didn't need brand new running shoes to pursue that very limited and very brief activity.As one who attended two Big Ten (now ""Big Fourteen"") universities during the late 60's and early 70's, I could not relate to this film in any possible way. Admittedly, I was fiercely independent back in those days, so I never affiliated with a fraternity or any association that substituted for one, which is what this group appeared to be. The dialogue was often inane, shallow, and just outright monotonous to the point of tears. No offense to the French film aficionados of the world, but I have seen far too many French films in which a set of characters sits around and expresses its philosophy of life, as was the case here, with no satisfying resolution as an outcome. To me, this movie's success was surprising, including its achievement of Oscar nominations not only for best picture (!) but for best screenplay directly for the screen(!). Seriously? Was 1984 such a lean year for Hollywood? Maybe George Orwell can explain it.In the end, we have an association of totally self-absorbed and self-obsessed baby boomers, a group of which I am a somewhat reluctant member, gathering to mourn one of their best friends who had just committed suicide for reasons that were never fully or properly explored. So, what did they do for most of the time? Lament ad nauseam over their own, selfish needs, desires, and shortcomings before suddenly erupting in dance to late sixties and early seventies songs that were, quite honestly, far from the best of so many possibilities that had been produced at the time. In fact, I found that the often abrupt transition to these songs interfered with whatever action was struggling to unfold on the screen. Although ""Joy to the World"" by Three Dog Night would have been one of my last choices from 1971 to close out this tedium, I was very happy to hear it as I realized then that the fat lady, bless her heart, had finally appeared and that this entire cinematic ordeal was finally coming to a merciful end. Indeed, joy to the world!I gave this film a rating of three. It could have been lower if not for the on location photography of picturesque Beaufort and the surrounding South Carolina low country.",The Big Chill

55,Jared_Andrews,A Nostalgia Film for Kids of the 1960s,4,18 May 2018,"The Big Chill is an exceptional title for a movie. It could be used for a number of different stories, ranging from some sort of action sci-fi flick to a get together of old friends. This movie is about the latter. This movie opens on a grim note. An old college pal has killed himself, so all his closest friends (now in their mid-thirties) gather for his funeral. One man gives an emotional speech about their lost friend. Everyone tears up. The funeral proceeds, then it ends with the playing of a favorite song from the past. It's the first of many classic songs played throughout the film. At first, they seem fine, even soothing and nostalgic. But they soon grow tired and stale. It's clear that the movie didn't believe enough in itself to establish the nostalgic vibe through the dialogue and visual palette, so it opted to blast hit song after hit song. This would make for a great mix for a road trip, but it's not an effective way to make a movie.After leaving the funeral, the friends gather at a country house and share stories of the old days. Past feelings re-emerge, as do realizations of the current dissatisfactions in their lives. Not much happens over the course of the weekend, save for a few strange adulterous moments. One is alleged to be for a greater purpose, but that claim is dubious and bizarre. They seemed more like typical college hookups, probably brought on by the emotional vulnerability they experience after the death of a friend. The movie is well-acted, and the characters are interesting enough. The jokes are hit and miss, with a few too many misses to score big points as a successful comedy. On the whole, it's not a total failure. For the appropriate crowd, it could really strike a chord and make a meaningful impact. As far as I can tell, the appropriate crowd is anyone in their mid-thirties to mid-fifties, especially those who grew up listening to the Rolling Stones. The movie doesn't offer any resolution-there isn't one to be had. They shared moments together in college, and they did so again during this weekend. It's a story about growing into later adulthood and accepting the life you've made. A reunion with old friends will not provide an antidote for all that ails you, but it can offer a temporary reprieve from your day to day. Maybe this time together will remind everyone that they should gather more often. Or, maybe this is just another moment in time.",The Big Chill

The movie has the fealing of nostalga in that it is an 80's film, but it is not a cheesy film. In fact it is a good movie from the decade (a decade that is widely forgotten in movie goers minds).The solid acting from a bunch of now well-known stars actually saves the movie because the story is sometimes either very thin or sometimes difficult to fully follow.Of course this may be that at times I was slightly distracted, but still a great movie would grab your attention.A couple of interesting things about this movie are the scenes with Kevin Costner (if only there were more or if only there was a DVD with the deleted scenes or at least commentary by Costner saying like ""and here is where I was cut as of the cast rest reflect"" on his character's life).Instead though Costner does not even get a credit as you only see his body at the very beginning.Music buffs will possible enjoy the movie the most as it does have a good soundtrack with rather unique uses of music (think Grateful Dead played during a funeral and you good possibly guess some of the interesting uses)Viewed on tape in 2001.

A close group of University of Michigan friends, having graduated many years before, reunite for the funeral of one of their group, a guy named Alex. Many themes are explored, including the guilt they feel for letting their friend slip away, without knowing about his pain, or his loneliness. All of the friends have achieved varying degrees of success and/or tragedy. This is all explored during the course of a weekend, as they all try to reconnect, and examine where their lives have taken them, as opposed to where they once believed their lives would go. A few romances, frustrated and unconsummated from their college years, are reignited.I guess we would all like to have a weekend like this with old friends.Well-acted, and a thoughtful story told very well. Having grown up in Michigan during the 60's, the motown music is thrilling to hear, and fits into the movie very well.

62,adrongardner,A cruise to nowhere,7,23 January 2021,"The Big Chill is a Woody Allen movie with real people and better music.Larry Kasdan's boomer epic would have no teeth at all without the Motown backbeat, but we hang on to the end even though there's no destination at all.It always felt like The Big Chill was a peek into Harrison Ford's college reunion and it still feels that way in 2020. We're just hanging out on the Falcon adrift of purpose but with the coffee talk of a jail cell in Rio Bravo. Without the soundtrack the movie would be dead in the water, but the Stones and the Band are just as much a character here as they are in a Scorsese piece, placing us into a time and place not only in history but in the mid-life malaise of the entire crowd.Are the best days behind or ahead? Nobody here has come to terms with either yet, but it feels in the end as if even though a friend has died, there's a lot of life left to live. Even if Kevin Costner's part was dead in the water, save the cufflinks, the movie may have no purpose, no compass and no plot - it still has a pulse and that's just enough to make it survive.",The Big Chill
63,kimbpaul,37 years later,9,20 April 2020,"I never get tired of seeing this ensemble flick. Countless times I've watched it since the 1st time seeing it in a theater, it holds up well; still gets to me. There's sadness, bitterness, dreams fulfilled and failed, mystery and joy. Great actors, some early in their careers. Well worth the watch a couple times a year.",The Big Chill
64,fred-houpt,The Big Yawn,5,2 November 2006,"I bought a copy of this film only on the strong recommendation of a friend of mine. Watched it last night and here are my views. Great cast, all excellent actors, somewhat early in their careers. All went on to much better films. I can see what attracted them to this script, the ensemble writing is evenly doled out, the American angst is well proportioned and clearly expressed. For me it is entirely dated and is fading fast. What appeared so neat and chick in 1983 now looks too self conscious and although well intentioned, limp like a wet noodle. I kept thinking of other films that had family and friend dynamics that really left an impression. Think of ""Ordinary People"", of ""Terms of Endearment"" and if you really want to have your eyebrows scorched, the white hot interpersonal relationship between Jack Nicholson and his estranged family when he returns home for a visit in ""Ironweed"".The Big Chill does exactly that: it cools out each and every single opportunity for these characters to catch fire and spit out some sparks. Why Kasdan, who both wrote and directed this movie, opted to smooth out all possibility of real drama is not clear to me. The film could have exploded along many different lines of friction. Instead all possible avenues of heat were subsumed by the relentless pit stops into self-examination, terminal long staring into the camera as the person thinks about something and then cut into the next scene without any closure. We get a drama that had all the makings of a volcanic eruption but the earth barely shook. It was all cooled out into a feel good retrospective of a generation that was unable to mourn for a lost friend and unable to emote past an adolescent level. No one was willing to give 100% and really hurt anyone and if pain was visible it was hugged away, kissed away and finally banished with too many ""you know I love you"" answers. Really, I thought: who talks this way? In real life, conflicts do not go so smoothly, almost ever. So, what was Kasdan offering us? A vision of bright people who were unable to take any meaningful risks at reaching each other at the core of the heart, too afraid to commit themselves lest they cause some discomfort along the way. The script ended up, for me at least, in portraying these fine actors as shallow and that is a shame. They can all act very well and the story could have been much darker. From where I sit in 2006 this film looks sad, dated and despite great music, half of what it could have been. If this film had been released today I suspect people would laugh, unable to see themselves in the exchanges that pass as communication. I was quite disappointed.",The Big Chill

1) Glenn Close sporting that ramen noodle hairdo.
2) There's a nude shot of the younger Mrs. Doubtfire & close ups of her posterior.
3) It's supposed to be a funeral yet it plays out like a ""chilled"" out hang. The mood is extremely irksome. None of the characters are even remotely likeable.
4) Lacks a coherent storyline, so tries to fill it with terrrible, random 70s music. There'll be people shaking their hips to the said music as well while traversing the kitchen space.

66,Better_Sith_Than_Sorry,Eight Characters In Search of an Exit,8,19 February 2019,"Plot in a Nutshell: An Oscar-nominated screenplay takes center-stage in this ensemble piece, focusing on a group of old college friends trying to come to terms with the suicide of one of their own.Why I rated in an '8': Two things. Soundtrack and script. I won't add much to what's already been said about the music in the film. It's a great collection of '60s and '70s tunes which went platinum within six months of release and 6x platinum by 1998. My only question is, who doesn't own this soundtrack? As for the script, it was widely recognized by multiple organizations and won the Writers Guild of America's Award for Best Comedy. To me it's the star of this film. Roger Ebert noted ""the dialogue sounds like a series of bittersweet captions from New Yorker cartoons."" That's a pretty good observation. Here's an example, spoken by Jeff Goldblum's character at the funeral: ""Amazing tradition. They throw a great party for you on the one day they know you can't come.""Several reviewers complain here that this film doesn't seem to 'go anywhere.' Ebert himself felt that 'there's no payoff.' This is accurate. If you are looking for a grand finale, you won't find it here. This isn't a story where someone gets the girl or wins the Nobel Prize. Have you ever heard the phrase ""it's not the destination, it's the journey?"" That encapsulates this film. The story itself isn't very exciting, but the music and dialogue that are used to tell that story - that's what makes this film worthy of repeat viewings.Best line: ""In Hollywood, I don't know who to trust. I don't know who likes me or why they even do like me.""/""Well you don't have that problem here."" (Pause) ""You know I don't like you.""Roger and me: Despite saying it was a good movie, Roger Ebert gave this 2.5/4 stars. I like it a little bit more - 8/10.Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Yes, definitely.",The Big Chill
67,Putzberger,Leave it in the freezer,2,17 May 2006,"There are a couple of wonderful moments in ""The Big Chill:"" the touch-football sequence, and the scene in which all the characters are jamming to the Temptations' ""Ain't Too Proud to Beg"" while making dinner. Had Kasdan kept these three or four minutes and left the plot and dialog on the cutting-room floor, he could have spliced together a handful of entertaining beer commercials that would have contributed far, far more to our culture than ""The Big Chill."" In and of itself, ""The Big Chill"" isn't that bad. It's just a silly soap opera that might deceive you into thinking it's High Art because of the A-list cast and pretensions to seriousness. It's very calming to watch, thanks to its shadowy lighting and Kasdan's preference for soft colors. No actor is particularly outstanding, but no one embarrasses himself. Special kudos must be awarded Oscar nominee Glenn Close, who, as adulterous wife Sarah, is able to deliver Harlequin Romance lines like ""there was a secret place in me that only Alex could touch"" as if a human being could actually say them. But what makes ""The Big Chill"" vile is its ideology.Has any movie done more damage to this country? On a superficial level, we had to endure ""thirtysomething"" and pathetic reunion tours by every washed-up 60's band on Earth. There's also the sad fact that movies like ""The Big Chill"" convinced a few addle-headed members of my demographic group (I was born in 1967) to try to create some kind of generational identity. (It was doomed to fail: there weren't that many of us, we didn't face an existential threat on the level of the Vietnam War and the self-appointed voice of our generation was Douglas Coupland, who couldn't write.) On a more permanent, damning level, it's possible that ""The Big Chill"" helped cement the myth of American decline. Please note, none of the aging hippies in this film were the slightest bit disappointed in or dissatisfied with themselves. No, they were angry at the world that didn't live up to their ideals. Particularly nauseating is Mary Kay Place, a crusading public defender who lost interest in her job when she found out she'd have to represent actual criminals. A close second is smug creep Kevin Kline, who dismisses all music released after, say, 1971 as garbage and rationalizes his materialism with a single throwaway line. The ultimate message of ""The Big Chill"" is that the world is going to hell, so you might as well make yourself a nice cup of herbal tea, toke up a number and nestle in your nice, big suburban house. Which this country's entire upper class has done while three genocides have raged and the children of the working class have fought and died in two wars.But there is one saving grace to ""The Big Chill:"" the filmmakers had the wisdom to cut Kevin Costner out of the movie. Imagine Kevin Costner and William Hurt in the same scene . . . it's a termite's wet dream.",The Big Chill
68,dwr246,They lost their starry notions on the way...,10,4 April 2006,"As people enter middle age, most contemplate their lives, asking how they got to where they are, what happened to their youthful dreams, and where they are going. This movie explores those ideas as seven college friends reunite for an unforgettable weekend.Seven friends who attended the University of Michigan in the sixties reunite for the funeral of their mutual friend, Alex (Kevin Costner, who was edited out of the film, and who only appears as body parts of the corpse). Alex has committed suicide while he and his girlfriend, Chloe (Meg Tilly) were staying with Harold (Kevin Kline) and Sarah (Glenn Close) Cooper. Harold is a successful businessman, and Sarah is a doctor. Coming in for the funeral are Sam Weber (Tom Berenger), a Hollywood actor; Michael Gold (Jeff Goldblum), a successful journalist; Nick Carlton (William Hurt), a drifter; Meg Jones, a Philadelphia DA; and Karen Bowen (JoBeth Williams), an unhappily married housewife. Once together for this sad event, the seven of them decide to spend the weekend together for an impromptu reunion. During the course of the weekend each of them confronts what has happened to their hopes, dreams, and idealism, where are today, and where they want to go. By the end, each has found something of their former selves to take with them as they go their separate ways.This is an interesting premise, and it's well executed here. You see where each person is proud of what he or she has accomplished, but also reminded by the presence of the others of what he or she dreamed of accomplishing. The gap between the two is what drives the film, and makes the self exploration real, as each person in turn opens up to their closest friends. In the end, they seem to realize that perhaps their best accomplishment has simply been their connection to each other.The acting is wonderful. The cast worked as an ensemble, so the level of acting among the performers is uniformly good. It is clear that the actors all respected and valued each other. As a result, the chemistry between them is real, and the relationships created are believable.I was a senior in college when I saw this, and at the time I wondered if I would worry about where I had been and where I was going as I aged. In the twenty-two years since graduation, I can only answer that yes, I have asked those questions, and explored those issues with those to whom I was close at the time. That's why I think this film has a certain timelessness, because it really does speak to everybody who has ever serious contemplated their life direction. And it's well worth taking the time to contemplate it along with those who do so in this film.",The Big Chill

Also along are Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, Mary Kay Place, Jobeth Williams William Hurt and Meg Tilly. Kevin Costner was to have played the deceased friend, however, his scenes were cut out. You can see his now famous hairline at the beginning of the film when the corpse of the deceased friend is being prepared for burial.Each of the characters open up, revealing lost dreams, empty expectations and hopes for the future. Close is simply marvelous and Hurt stands out as the flaky member of the group, who doesn't seem to know which direction to take.It's a little hard to believe that such a diverse group could have all achieved such great success and fortune. For example, Close's character is a doctor, Kline owns a group of shoe stores, Goldblum writes for People magazine, Berenger is a famous TV star etc.A small enough fault as the main essence of the film involves the various dramas unfolding between the characters.The Big Chill is a great ensemble piece, not to be missed.",The Big Chill

I remember I was waiting with bated breath for 14 years and then...This is a somewhat interesting talk piece about college leftists who have grown up and have re-assembled to honor their fallen friend years later as matured leftists with money. I mean, is there a more repugnant thing in this world than people who rail against capitalism and use that same system to get rich (see Bill Ayres, Yoko Ono and The Eagles)? I believe that this was a hit because of the soundtrack not because of the protagonists' underlying beliefs. Case in point, early in the film the defense lawyer played by Mark Kay Place was complaining about her clients, as she expected to defend ""Bobby and Huey"". That would be Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, 2 members of the Black Panthers, which was a domestic terror organization. Charming.There are some funny parts in the film, which is not completely awful.

72,TheTwistedLiver,movie about self important thirty something yuppies in the 80's,4,20 March 2010,"First off, let me say this is a movie with a great cast of actors, most of them going on to really define themselves in other movies as true talents. That being said, this movie is really dated, and if it was other people acting in it would fail completely. Having lived in Ann Arbor for five years on the campus of the University of Michigan, I can honestly say that the director truly did capture the smug self importance of university of Michigan alumni. This he got down perfectly, as well as the narcissism and ego of the baby-boomer generation, who hypocritically dove head first into greed and money after sowing revolutionary oats in the sixties.But most of all, this film seems to be about the confusion and despair those of that generation were during the early years of the , capitalist 80's. The characters reconnecting after one of their college friends killed himself because he felt he was a failure, speaks volumes for the self induced pressures placed on those of that time. Real or imaginary, failure didn't seem to be an option.Tom Berrenger as the movie star character of J.T. Lancer, a take off of T.J. Hooker of course, seems the most out of place amongst this group of friends, he doesn't seem like a Michigan graduate, way too good looking and far less cerebral. Jeff Goldblum would be perfect, he would have been a student and graduate from Michigan, intelligent, smug, self important, selfish.The woman who wants a baby, the character played by Mary Kaye Place, she claims she just wants someone to ""Plant the seed"" but when Jeff Goldblum offers she says something sarcastic about how it wasn't romantic, if she truly just wanted someone to plant the seed and nothing more romance shouldn't be a consideration. This of course is just one flaw in the film. Overall, at the time this came out, and for people of a certain generation I'm sure this was an important film, but now in this day and age it is way less relevant, as many wish they had the luxury of choosing to reject capitalism, most are struggling to get by during this time of the great reset.",The Big Chill

Everyone raves about the music, and while there is no doubt it is good, this is where I have my largest bone to pick. The overly clichéd use of most of these songs is unforgivable.

The characters, however, do accurately portray those of it's generation: self-important, empty, know-it-all hypocrites. If I sound angry it's because they are infuriating, along with the director, who, as in his other masterpiece, ""Grand Canyon,"" has produced a film to successfully appeal to and promulgate the worship of childhood that has so marred our society.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this pretentious tripe.",The Big Chill
75,bobvend,Tries to be profound...and fails miserably.,3,23 January 2019,"Aside from the beautiful South Carolina location shooting, I thought very little of this film about a group self-obsessed proto-yuppies who never run out of whine. The ensemble cast is well-suited for their roles (some like Kevin Kline, who couldn't shed his self-absorbed yuppiness if he tried, are too well-suited). These are all characters types most of us have either know , or been ourselves. Yet they come across as cardboard, vapid, and annoying; and their's no reason to give a steamin' country dump about them or their issues. It's nearly impossible to invest in any of them or care what happens to them.I'm also going to break with the majority of reviewers here by stating that the soundtrack, however great, was a huge distraction for me. Far too many scenes lost any chance at poignancy by having these Top 40 tunes shoehorned into them. It's almost as if the studio was hedging its bets...it the film bombed, at least they'd have a killer movie soundtrack album to push.It's pretty sad when the only thing in the film that truly feels authentic is the on-TV intro for Tom Berenger's character's slick private eye TV series, which is hilarious in it dead-on accurate lampoon.

76,bjacob,Well made but meandering,6,13 January 2018,"I agree with what Roger Ebert has written about this movie: something in the style of ""it knows all the moves but has no payoff and it doesn't go anywhere"". It's interesting as a portrait of (very) early middle age but eventually you're left with a question: ""so what?"".There are also some minor inconsistencies which are each very forgivable but all together contribute to the disconnect I feel towards this movie: it's clearly set in the 80s but the characters are supposed to have a past rooted in the 60s counterculture, and yet they seem so relatively young. And yet they have turned that page pretty swiftly, and made it big, while continuing from time to time to utter oddly naive considerations. 
There's a lot of music in the film, diegetic and not. Sometimes we get whole songs while the characters do stuff in the background, and it seems a bit of a narrative copt-out.For the positives: it's very well acted and contains several genuinely funny moments. But I struggle to see what's supposed to be ""seminal"" about it. There's another film on a very similar theme, ""Le déclin de l'empire americain"" -- which feels infinitely more real and poignant than this one.",The Big Chill

If you have never seen it, watch him in 'French Kiss', in which he nails the French accent so perfectly, as well as the mannerisms.A bit weird to see Mary Kay Place in such a smaller role.

To put it mildly, I made it through about an hour and couldn't stand any more.This movie ushered in the flurry of baby boomer flicks that polluted the movie industry for the next dozen or so years. I was actually relieved when Tom Brokaw's book spotlighted the Greatest Generation, since it was a welcome switch from navel-gazing fifties kids whining about their lost youth. Do baby boomers think no one else ever experienced anything -- love, sex, parenthood, grief?

Having watched it again just now, I have to reiterate what so many others have said, that its being so dated detracts from its message. No matter who the victim, or how the survivors may be related to him and to each other, suicides are tragedies. Pure and simple. It seems that Alex's friends snap too easily out of their grief and into a horny, hazy nostalgia punctuated by a Motown soundtrack that provides rimshots to scenes where zippy one-liners didn't come easily.Nonetheless, well-chosen ensemble casts always have an appeal for me, and in this one I particularly enjoy Jeff Goldblum and Mary Kay Place. Her ""they're either married or gay. . ."" speech is a classic; one I had memorized after the second time I saw the movie. Twenty years on, I can still relate.What I watch ""The Big Chill"" for now are all the wonderful locations in Beaufort, SC. The house used for the exteriors is called ""Tidalholm.""

I like a good ""serious-comedy"" every once in a while but this one was just too weird for me. Most of the characters were just un-inspiring and boring and the few that did have some life were just creepy. Giving your husband away to impregnate your friend? Talk about screwed up morals. In the real world this becomes a big problem and never ends well. Not to mention as a father of 3 boys it would make me feel like a real winner trying to explain to that kid when he gets older how and why he was conceived. I guess his answer would be something like; ""well we all got stoned for the weekend after our friend killed himself and thought having an illegitimate son would be a lot of fun"". Although I think the 60's produced a lot of good music, the afterbirth of ideas are just horrible. Thank God the movie industry has moved on from such ideological, boring crap.

85,timcurryisgod,"entertaining, iconic 1980's movie, but kind of full of s _ _t",6,20 March 2017,"***sort of plot spoilers, broadly speaking*** I think a more accurate synopsis of this movie is: seven old college friends get together over the funeral of one of their cohorts. They each center themselves amidst the tragedy of the suicide of their friend, i.e. ""it's all about me, b/c I should have...."" They reminisce over their convictions when in college as compared to now. They realize they're sell outs but agree they are okay with it. The one person in the group who reminds them how cushy they've always had it gets chastised for so doing while everyone else agrees they're all still good people. Everyone ends up happy because they all have money to continue pursuing their own interests. Meg Tilly's character complements the self-serving dialogue of the others with unpretentious, guileless candor.The movie attempts to convey the bittersweet-ness/ sadness/ realization that the white baby boomers who grew up privileged and ""came of age"" during the 1960's~ a time of social consciousness and change ~ really did not carry those same convictions into their post college lives, and they must face this.A star-studded, entertaining movie w/ a cool soundtrack, but definitely told from a privileged POV.William Hurt delivers the best performance acting wise; but then he also was playing the character who reminded everyone else of reality versus their self obsessed guilt, showing the others that obviously they didn't really hang on to the principles they supposedly valued while in college; it was just ""cool"" for them. I really enjoy Hurt in such roles where he is cast in contrast to the protagonist(s). His acting is so expertly understated and filled with effective emotional subtleties; I really think he is a great unsung actor- just remarkable.While it's great fun to watch Kevin Klein and Glenn Close as this loving couple who are a touchstone for their friends, that pales in comparison to the gravity and depth of Hurt's performance. It's also fun to watch the delightful candor and naivety of Meg Tilly's character which she plays really well. And yes, Jeff Goldblum is very funny in the movie and fun to watch.The setting is beautiful of course; it's South Carolina coastline and the Tidewater mansion. It does add something to the story; perfect setting for it. I haven't read the book yet; guessing it's pretty good.",The Big Chill

The big names actors involved made me curious about seeing it. It's just goes no where and the characters are dull and unlikable.

87,SammyK,"Monument to the ""Me"" generation",6,13 May 1999,"Watching ""The Big Chill"" from the point of view of someone who didn't grow up in the sixties is a painful experience. Being emotionally and socioeconomically distanced from the subject matter, the film's flaws are glaring and verging on insulting, if it wasn't for the film's sheer naivete. While the cast is otherwise impressive, and Lawrence Kasdan has produced some work of note (penning ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""), the film's premise is one of Yuppie self-infatuation. The film's characters lament a lost youth of idealized rebelliousness, while never drawing to attention to the fact that they have become the very epitome of what they once railed against - the establishment (and mastheads at that). Their woes are excruciatingly superficial - it's as if real problems don't exist. It's the 80s at its worst - displaying cheap sentimentality, manipulatingly conveyed through a conspicuously consumable soundtrack, no doubt one of the most successful soundtrack albums ever, found in the record collections of every baby boomer. It's interesting to note that Lawrence Kasdan tried to replicate the success of this film with ""Grand Canyon"" which was an even greater mess, incorporating another staple of the boomer generation - New Age Philosophy.

90,mcshortfilm,"peace, love and yuppie-ness",5,24 August 2005,"""The Big Chill"" was a classic film of the 1980's. It was the film which identified the 1960's baby boomer's as modern contemporary ""yuppies"". Throughout the 1980's, yuppies were spotlighted in the media as the generational trend in post-Reagan era living. After ""the Big Chill"" people turned to Doonesbury and ""Thirtysomething"" to find out what the baby boomer's were up to. What once became a generation of free spirited hippies soon changed into a lifestyle revolved around corporate jobs, wearing suits and driving Volvo's. ""The Big Chill"" is a simple story that involves a group of old friends who reunite after hearing the news that Alex, a close friend has committed suicide. After the funeral, they spend a long weekend at the house of one of their friends, a married couple played by Kevin Kline and Glenn Close. They get together and spend time talking and trying to make sense of their lives by questioning the death of Alex and what's become of themselves. There is a sense of confusion about who they are and what they've become. ""I always feel like somebody wants something from me"" says a friend played by Tom Bergeron whose turned into a famous Hollywood actor. He feels guilty about his fame and the wealth that's earned him his paranoid suspicion's of other people. How could a group of friends like this go from ""tuning in an dropping out"" to living this corporate lifestyle? ""I hate to think it was all just...fashion."" says a confused Glenn Close. Kevin Kline offers reassurance that they ""accomplished things"". The 1960's did change a lot for the civil rights movement, the women's movement and protesting to help stop the war in Vietnam. What I always wanted to know, was Kevin Kline speaking on behalf his friends or his whole generation? Both of my parents who lived through the 1960's never became yuppies. I tried watching this film once with a close friend who was heavily involved in the drugs, protests and road trips of that period. After a half hour or so into the movie, he was incapable of watching anymore. He did'nt believe that these characters actually lived through the same things that he lived through. It sort of falls into this notion that if you grew up during the sixties and listened to the Beatles and had somewhat shaggy hair, you were instantly considered a hippie. It's a way for people to identify with something they had little or nothing to do with. The number of people who actually did experiment with drugs, sex and other aspects of life were really far few from the mass culture. This is why I feel suspicious of ""The Big Chill"". How involved were these characters in the hippie movement? There is one character Nick, played by William Hurt who seems like the most believable character. He has a great performance as a bitter man who is tormented between the past and the present. He still has some of his naive and youthful instincts. He also seems like the most likable because he doesn't seem to hide any emotions like the rest of his friends. The other characters like the lawyer, the writer for People magazine and the movie star...how genuinely involved were they in the 1960's movement? We see these characters trying to relive the past by doing drugs and even sharing sexual partners. As my friend said ""It seems so phony. I don't know anyone who turned into this"". A lot of baby boom audiences have responded bitterly about this film because it seems so personal and yet they cannot relate to the characters, and therefore they feel fooled, tricked or envious of these characters."" The Big Chill"" does not speak for an entire generation and that is the problem. William Hurt may have been stuck in the past, but for crying out loud, he shouldn't be wearing a suit and driving a Porsche!",The Big Chill
91,JasonXIX,"""I don't like talking about my past as much as you guys do""",9,6 July 2021,"In recent times, The Big Chill has been relegated to 'Boomer' movie status. Probably due to the time it was made, the soundtrack, and the rampant narcissism. But to call this a boomer movie is to completely miss the point.As a millennial, I can say the narcissism and selfishness on display in this movie fits right in with the current social media generation. The characters in this movie even record themselves with a 1980s video camera. I can only imagine all the selfies and social media posts this movie would contain if made today, so this movie is not unique to a single generation.Also, this movie isn't just about the death of the 60's, it's about the death of idealism. It's really easy to be idealistic in college when you have no other real responsibilities. However, once you're out in the real world, you have to make many compromises if you want to survive. Maybe Alex couldn't live with compromises he chose to make?The Big Chill doesn't end with any phony epiphanies or big revelations. The viewer is not offered any reassurance that the characters have learned anything or are any better off than they were at the beginning. Such is life.",The Big Chill

If you ever had a really tight knit group of school friends that you absolutely love and then spent years without them, this film will allow you to feel like you are having a reunion with your friends. The closeness, inside jokes, various personalities, mini-dramas all add to the flavor. The soundtrack is one of the best of all time and the storytellers use the music to connect the audience with the characters. For such a large cast of strong actors, this group does a wonderful job not to overshadow one another. It is a harmonious blend of styles and personalities that can make solid use of non-verbal communication. I have viewed thousands of movies. Very, very few deserve a second viewing. The Big Chill is one that I have enjoyed at least ten times over the years.",The Big Chill

I sat through the whole thing waiting for something even remotely interesting to happen.  Nothing ever did.  Bluntly put, it's an overblown, self-important piece of yuppie garbage which might serve as a cure for insomnia but as a movie it's pig swill.  None of the characters have any basis in reality, nor do any of them evoke even the slightest bit of empathy(although to be fair the acting-along with the soundtrack saves this movie from being a total catastrophe.  There isn't a bad performance to be found here)  These aren't exactly people you'd want to hang with.

As has been stated in other reviews criticizing The Big Chill, nothing really happens. A group of old college friends gather for the weekend after the funeral of one of their pals. They talk, they eat, they dance. But that's it. No drama! No conflict! No real plot! A complete bore. Yes, the all-star cast is very good. The production values are decent. There's even a couple of good oldies inserted in the movie that make you move to the music. But that's not good enough to keep one's interest for nearly two hours. I couldn't wait for the movie to end as I kept looking at my watch every 5 minutes. I'm a fan of Lawrence Kasdan. Looking at the roster of flicks he's written over the years (Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Empire Strikes Back) you can see this guy has talent. But I wonder how this movie managed to win a WGA for best original comedy much less get nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. A dull movie-viewing experience.",The Big Chill
96,kostasxrysogelos,This is the 80s.,8,11 September 2006,"Some of the users claim that this movie is a remake to a film called ""The return of the saecaucus seven"" (1980). I haven't seen it, I didn't even know it existed, so I won't go any further. All I want to do is add a comment on one of the best 80s movies.I often ask myself: ""Which is the essential 60s, 70s, etc. movie?"", and by saying ""essential"", I mean which movie best captures the spirit of its times. I have come to the following conclusion: ""Easy rider"" (1969)is the essential 60s movie, ""The exorcist"" (1973) is the one for the 70s, and this one represents in an excellent way the 80s. One could claim, that the beginning of a decade doesn't necessarily deal with the same questions that the end of it does. That is true, but I think that the only decade, that actually fits this claim, is the 60s. The 70s were much a decade of decadence, loss of faith and disappointment. The 80s were a decade of show-biz. The point was to look happy, even if you weren't. That's the point of ""The Big Chill"".Essentially starting from this point, the movie has a lot more to say. What we are experiencing, is the true decadence of the ""flower-generation"". They don't have a purpose in their lives, they have lost their faith and are truly scared of the present and the future. Much of it also goes through the 70s; but there's a crucial difference: In the 80s you must look happy. All of them try to show that everything's cool, yet they know that they're fooling themselves. The shadow of their deceased friend -who would be 'played', as a corpse, by K. Costner- is everywhere.Many critics hold this movie as the most mature of its decade. I wouldn't go so far, but I know it's a film with a point: The love-generation is dead and gone forever. Four years later, ""Wall Street"" will complete the puzzle: The Yappies are here.",The Big Chill
97,pwalkerfm,Not as good as I remember,4,22 April 2021,"I don't usually like movies less as the years go by, but this one is the exception. TCM is running it again here in '21, and frankly, I find this movie less enjoyable today than I did when it came out some 40 years ago. Today it seems somewhat indulgent and cumbersome with a bunch of idealistic boomers trying to cope with the real world in their 30's. I won't deny the cast is star-studded, (with many who went on to even greater success), and the acting is quite good. The story is too predictable and at times, just boring. The entire cast seems like life revolves around them, and their stories are not very interesting. About the soundtrack...why is the music so loud and the dialog so muted? I guess that was a ""thing"" in early 80's movie making, but to me it is irritating. Overall, yes this movie is generally recommended by most, but I find it less interesting than I did when I was in my 20's. Perhaps it is just age talking here.",The Big Chill
98,leliorisen,The Way We Were,9,18 June 2003,"I am about 10 years younger than the generation that makes up the Lawrence Kasdan masterpiece, ""The Big Chill."" But when the movie came out, and I was a decade removed from my own midwestern Big 10 alma mater Wisconsin (as opposed to the film's Michigan alumni), the film had an enormous impact on me. For a long time, it remained the film I would list as my all-time favorite.While I still am a big fan of the film, having recently purchased the DVD and seeing it for the first time in quite some time, I did find a hint of dated psychobabble, enough for me to drop it a notch to a 9 from a 10. But what the film did so well was inhabit a certain generational psyche and mindset and it did it with finesse.What makes The Big Chill so special is the way it captures a particular group of friends who have an evolutional moment in their lives when one of their college friends passes on. It's a film about re-discovering ones own lives and roots and moving on.Those who lived close enough to the generation in the movie to have understood what the characters represent, appreciate the insightfulness and message of the film. And the incredible soundtrack remains one of the best uses of music in movies ever.It was this film that turned me on to a whole slew of superb actors. Kline, Hurt, Close, Place and crew exude great chemistry. The entire experience was exhilirating at first viewing and remains so to this day for me. It's a personal film and tends to make one examine their own lives and relationships.Sure, there is a bit of dated material in it, but it still is vastly superior to much of the current wave of self-indulgent swill that uses similar ensemble conventions.Interestingly, I can somewhat understand someone who did not live in this time being bored with it.

101,michaelmunkvold,"I hate ""The Big Chill"". There. I said it.",5,17 May 2015,"Maybe I was born too late to enjoy ""The Big Chill"". I've been told that it is one of the defining statements of the baby boom generation - people of my parents' generation mention this movie in the same breath as Woodstock and the March on Washington. It's lost on me, though. I see only two hours of narcissistic whining and dancing around a kitchen table to Motown.Maybe you had to be there. Some movies are inseparable from their era, and mean far more to people who were there at the time than to people who have only read about it. Such movies bring back memories of what it was like to be alive at that moment in history. Nostalgia can make even a mediocre movie a powerful experience.Make no mistake, ""The Big Chill"" is a mediocre movie. Yes, I know it's ""culturally significant"". I know it gave birth to the ensemble comedy-drama as we know it. And yes, I know the Motown soundtrack is awesome. But I just didn't like this movie. For me, it was nothing more than watching people I didn't like talking (and talking and talking) about things I didn't care about. Watching this movie is like going to a party where everybody but you has known each other for years. The audience is the odd man out.The plot, such as it is: A group of thirty-somethings get together for the funeral of their college buddy, Alex, who committed suicide. The group's power couple, Harold (Kevin Kline) and Sarah (Glenn Close), invite the others to stay at their house for the weekend. Memories are shared, old wounds are reopened, and, of course, old flames have sex. And that's it. There's no climax or resolution. It doesn't end, it just stops.Performances are varied. Kline and Close are wonderful as the adults in the room, people who are too busy living their lives to have existential crises. William Hurt is fun as a smart-assed screwup; he may not know where his life is going, but unlike the others he has a sense of humor about it.The rest of the cast struggles, however: JoBeth Williams and Mary Kay Place are given paper-thin characters as Middle-aged Women With Romantic Troubles, and Jeff Goldblum (as the group ""brain"") and Tom Berenger (as an aging actor) fall back on their stock characters of Spazzy Nerd and Wooden Tough Guy, respectively. Meg Tilly, as Alex's much younger girlfriend, seems like a little kid at the grownups' table - although, to be fair, maybe that's the point.We never really know these people. We don't get to see inside their friendships and see why they supposedly love each other so much. We're just supposed to take it on faith that they've been through everything together and will stick together no matter no what. I don't see why they would bother.I'm sure that ""The Big Chill"" was powerful for Baby Boomers who were just starting to make the transition from Flower Children to regular adults. Every generation needs a movie it can call its own, a movie that reminds them of a time when they were young and the world was no bigger than the sum of their own problems. But for such a movie to really succeed, it has to reach beyond that generation, to have the same resonance for each new generation that sees it.""The Big Chill"" fails that test. Middle-age doesn't look good on it.",The Big Chill

104,1981,A let down.,5,24 May 2001,"I have to admit, this movie did not impress me. I had heard, many times, that this movie was a modern classic that dealt with the existential crisis of growing older and facing the ephemerality of one's youthful dreams. Furthermore, the topic, suicide and its effect upon a close circuit of college friends, did seem intriguing. But it did not hit the mark, in fact, I feel the movie grossly missed its intended message and sunk into equivocality and ambivalence.What do I mean? For example, it becomes very apparent that everyone is touched and hurt by the suicide of their friend, however, why must they turn to marijuana, sex, infidelity and some highly questionable decision making like Mary Kay Place's search for a possible father to aid her in conceiving a child without a father? Now I am not some strict moralist and I am not saying that the world should conform to the loftiest of ideals, but I do feel as though we have a meandering script, a story without a message, merely a half-hearted continuation of an ethos that died hard at the close of the 1960's, i.e. free love and the recreational usage of drugs. We never see this successful and supposedly adult characters candidly address their pain, disillusionment, sorrow. What we see is them revert back to old college idealism and easy answers to pressing and disheartening questions. The script seems to suggest that while life is not easy, it is okay to use drugs and sex to depart from life's problems for awhile, no harm done. I disagree, but then again I am also far more cynical at my age than these characters evidently were when they were in college in the 1960s.My one compliment of this movie is its excellent music, however I don't think it was artistically crafted to aid and serenade the montage.",The Big Chill

However, one of my prerequisites for a movie to be good is that there be a story, or something at least resembling one.The Big Chill has no discernible story. As you've no doubt already read, it's about a group of yuppies who reunite for a weekend after the death of one of their college friends.The movie essentially deals with these people rekindling old friendships, and trying to ""find"" themselves. So for two hours we watch people sitting around and talking...people who are self-absorbed narcissists who, as a result, we really don't care about. The movie reminds me of the scene from Woody Allen's ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" where after Gil (Jeff Daniels)walks off the screen, the other actors refuse to go on with the story, and just sit around playing cards. the difference, of course, was in that movie, the inaction was part of the plot, while in Big Chill there is no plot. it's as if someone took a movie camera and placed it in someones living room, and just left it on.

Now it's playing in heavy rotation on my cable provider, so I watched it again, and apart from the music, I couldn't figure out what was so great about it. What a sad group of selfish, narcissistic tools! Their characters play this to varying degrees, but they're all jerks one way or another. Sarah and Harold are a super successful couple who have supposedly put Sarah's affair with the deceased behind them by soldering on in a public perfect couple 2-step, but Sarah clearly never got over the deceased (several subtle scenes demonstrate this). Apparently, she ends up salving this wound by allowing her husband to impregnate their lawyer friend, Meg, who is also a guest for the weekend and refers to old clients as ""repulsivos"" and to her need to earn a good living as ""El greedo strikes again."" Who wrote that crap?! Then she tries hooking up with virtually every man under the roof (save for lonley housewife Karen's husband, Richard) before finally nailing the seemingly perfect Harold. Karen has a long-burning crush on now tv star Sam, and tells him she's leaving the boring, predictable . Richard, only to plan on returning to her married life after ultimately seducing Sam. Nick is a self-loathing drug dealer who is impotent, and that's about as far as his character development goes. Michael is a lecherous magazine journalist who starts pursuing the deceased's much-younger girlfriend AT THE FUNERAL while also having a girlfriend at home, and basically has zero redeeming qualities. Finally, Chloe, the girlfriend, who gives us no useful information regarding her boyfriend's suicide, who was only with him for 4 months, and adds essentially nothing to the story (though I adore Meg Tilley, it's just a shame her character didn't have more to do). I know it's not great to review older movies though a modern lens, because times change, and whatever year a movie comes out, it's largely relevant to that time, and should be appreciated as such. But no matter what year it is now, the main reason this movie doesn't hold up is that it's impossible to care about these people because they are so awful, and it drags the entire movie down.",The Big Chill
115,lancekoz,"Not perfect, but still excellent",8,11 June 2007,"Cable played ""The Big Chill"" Saturday, and I have to say it is still excellent. It's not perfect...but tries and attains enough in its successes to more than make up for uneven acting and some clumsy, too-sweet moments in the script.And although the concerns of the people seem somewhat thirty-ish and need to be considered in the time-period of the eighties, the conversations about friendship, morality and life-choices are still important and deftly worked into the storyline. It was a hit driven by good writing about somewhat believable humans, which is much less common in mainstream movies nowadays, especially ones with such a big name cast.And that fun, fun music doesn't hurt either.I agree that it may have been copied from ""Return of the Seacaucus Seven"" (which is fine in its own way), but see Chill anyway.

116,hank65,half-assed imitation of a much better film,3,5 September 2001,"I've come to use ""The Big Chill"" as a litmus test over the years. Hollywood, in the person of Kasdan, made this Hollywoodized version of ""Return of the Secaucus Seven,"" and made it fake and false where Sayle's film was low-key, well-observed and believable. Anyone who tells me they prefer it has different tastes than mine.Yes, it has a great cast, great production values, and a great soundtrack--all that money can buy. Unfortunately, its writing and conception are Hollywood conceits, shallow and silly. Not only are the characters less interesting than in Sayles's work, albeit better played, growing up in ""The Big Chill"" means giving up ANY AND ALL your idealism, as opposed to finding ways to live up to them, which is what real people try to do.Fortunately, the whining Baby Boomer characters that Kasdan so likes are becoming unfashionable, and modern audiences seem to be seeing through this piece of tripe.",The Big Chill

With a cast consisting entirely of soulless automatons exuding dime-store angst and sorrow, you can look forward to a combination of the vacuousness of a typical chick flick, combined with a yearning desire for critical respect.A complete waste of time.  Two hours of your life that you'll never get back.  When this film is remade towards the end of this decade, look for Sandra Bullock, Hugh Grant, and Matthew McConaughey to be the cloying, overaged brats on the screen, rather than Jeff Goldblum, a random Tilly, and the always unctious Glenn Close.

118,thebuckguy,"Cartoonish, would be unwatchable w/o William Hurt & the Soundtrack",3,19 January 2016,"I saw this when it first came out and occasional TV viewings since then haven't made me a fan. Some time after seeing this, I saw ""Return of the Secaucus 7"" which probably inspired it--the director of ""The Big Chill"", Lawrence Kasdan used to deny ever hearing of Secaucus 7, and later just denied seeing it. Unconvincing, because it was a movie that played for months at some theaters and helped usher in the 80s/90s wave of indie film. John Sayles made it for $20K, employing actor friends and using a plot that brought together college classmates, most of whom had gone on in the way normal ways that people often did in their first 10-15 years after college and even poked fun at their old political idealism. It even had a subplot involving a penis, like ""Big Chill"". Despite cheap production values, I saw why people had loved it--Secaucus 7 captured change and provided a natural setting of friendships gone deep and frayed. As for ""Big Chill"", it's easy to see why many critics and members of the public never liked it. It's basically a high concept version of Secaucus 7--better production values, middling known actors and overly dramatic, cynical shifts in people's lives. The acting seems flat and the characters don't really seem to engage each other. At least we were spared Kevin Costner trying to act--I always though he should have stuck to corpses. The best parts were William Hurt who probably was playing himself--not literally, but he has the best lines and delivery and carries off the most twisted, if somewhat unbelievable back story. And then the soundtrack...without it the vapid quality of the movie would have been in the foreground throughout.",The Big Chill
119,Smile_U_SOB,"""No one ever said it would be fun. At least... no one ever said it to me.""",10,28 January 2008,"""No one ever said it would be fun. At least... no one ever said it to me."" This is the line spoken from a character named Richard who is not part of the core of baby boomers, instead this character is the conservative uptight husband of one of the characters, and what he says sums up the entire film. The Big Chill refers to the chill that director Kasden had through his bones when running into an old college friend who had different ""values"" than him, and Kasden felt a ""Big Chill"" running through his body realizing that this person whom he knew as a college kid had a far different outlook. In the scene where Richard is sharing his personal views with two of the baby boomer characters, played by William Hurt and Tom Berenger, Hurt gets a look a lot like there's a chill running through him. But then after Richard says ""No one ever said it would be fun. At least... no one ever said it to me"", both boomers get a look like ""Perhaps he's right"", and indeed he is. This movie is a classic, because it not only embraces the baby boomers and their side, but it lets them realize that their youth was in fact... youth, and when its time to grow up, life isn't as easy and/or simplistic as when you are young. Jeff Goldblum is my personal favorite character, providing some of the best lines since he is a true outsider of the group; as is William Hurt's character, a drug dealer who still hasn't grown up. In one scene he mentions that perhaps all of them never knew each other at all being that they were so spoiled as children. The entire cast is fabulous. The weakest link is Mary Kay Place's story about wanting to get impregnated; it sort of drifts in and out of soap opera qualities, but no matter... This is one of the best character-driven films ever made, and I recommend it highly for baby boomers or for those of us who are annoyed by them.",The Big Chill

124,romanos_georgiou,I heard it through the grapevine,8,9 March 2009,"There is no great beyond. There is nothing waiting for us, there is nothing to look forward to, there is no hope for the days to come. This is an obituary for the generation past.The Big Chill is one of the greatest American movies ever made dealing with the concept of loss. I am you. I am all of you. A generation lost, a generation out of the tracks and into the unknown. You are what you choose in this life, not in some glorious afterlife, you are your hopes and dreams, your failures and successes, your mistakes and wrong doings, your past and your future, you are your friends.There is no doubt that the concept of modern western life runs through the looking glass of adulthood and friendship. These two ethical constructions define not only the individual, but also his surrounding environment, the juxtaposition of self and society, of creation or destruction within the normal boundaries of a capitalistic State. It is within these constructions that family is born. Nevertheless, the binding force of the entire human web is based on the only natural error that Man has never come to terms with: death.The circle of friends portrayed in The Big Chill is long broken; a smell of forgotten innocence only remains to remind the group that once they were one. Not pieces of a puzzle, but the puzzle itself. Back in college they've learned to act as a fist, with strong bonds with one another; back in the American 60s, they learned that the dream of piece, love and understanding was not utopic, not unreachable, but just moments away All of this now already faded away.In the prosperous America of the 80s lies another reality for them, the ultimate capitalistic dream, the life of the modern man encloses words such as family, money, kids, school, house, company, but not friendship. The ultimate hope of the once strongly connected group rests in the hands of the misfit, the one that never grew up, the one that probably stayed glued onto daydreams of the past and not conformities of the present, the boy that flew out of the window. And it is in this point exactly where Lawrence Kasdan begins his story, he heard a sound, probably we all did, and it was from the grapevine.The circle comes into closure, when one dies. After the funeral, a weekend is all that there is left for the eight friends to try and comprehend what went wrong. But in this very last stand of their own, they realize that what was missing was not something out there, but rather something within each and every one of them; old friends after all miss each other. With a light, romantic and earthly touch, Kasdan achieves his filmic purpose. You want to be a part of this, you want to reach out and feel the warmth, you don't want this to endand it doesn't. At the end, we'll all leave in that house forever, alongside with Sam, Sarah, Michael, Nick, Harold, Meg, sipping coffee, hot chocolate and wine under the sounds of Marvin Gaye and the Temptations, knowing that all this is our personal, unique hideaway, our world outside the world, our very own Neverland.",The Big Chill

In fact, it's one of those rare gems that came out of the 80s that luckily does not look or feel like the 80s. The quality of the film is uncanny. I especially took to the characters Michael and Meg (Goldblume and Place). Their sarcastic and ironic wit is really captivating. So, instead of going out to dinner with your friends, rent this film and invite these friends over for a couple of hours.

Personally, I feel that movies like these shall be made in every 10-15 years. Movies are not only a source of entertainment but also informative. This early 80s movie depicts the life styles of 30 somethings of that generation. We have tons of stupid teen movies or cheap ROM-coms and I found no much difference between them in terms of content or stories whichever decades they were made in. But movies like big chill gives good idea where we are going in life compared to our last generation. This is feel good drama and we can identify ourselves with the character even after 30 years.

For those of you who aren't looking for an in depth analysis of the film, just want to know if it's worth watching, let me start out by saying the movie is worthless drivel. This movie has a reputation of almost being a modern classic. So like most movie fans I thought I'd give it a look. What a disappointment. I would have been much better off watching ""Mama's family"" reruns. And that show was horrible of course. Though the film has some great actors (And some of my favorite actors - Tom Berenger and Kevin Klein {sp?}) That is literally the only positive comment I have about this movie. The story is simply terrible. Dark depressing drivel. This reminds me of some of Hemingway's later work. He was hailed as a great author. And then he shot himself. And people realized that he was not great he was depressed. This movie is another of those situations. If you like movies that are intentionally depressing and morbid, this is for you. I, on the other hand, am just waiting to find out that the principle creator of this film has shot him/herself. Or committed suicide in some other way. We can only hope that the people who were involved in this hunk of worthless garbage have not made any more movies. After I finish this warning (review is not nearly a strong enough word) to other movie lovers, I will look up the film makers and note them. If only to be sure I never again subject myself to such simplistic trash. You can bet that many of the positive reviews on this movie are posted by bandwagon viewers. In other words, people who write positive reviews simply because of the movie's reputation. Do not waste your time on this one.

131,Conrad-23,A Superb Film about the Importance of Friends,10,24 July 2000,"The Big Chill is one of those films that anyone who had a group of friends and aspirations from youth can easily relate to and better yet, enjoy! The 8 characters in this film are extremely well-developed and all have equal and individual importance to the group as a whole.  The story is about 8 friends who went to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor during the late 60's.   All came from affluent families (this is told by Hurt's character in the film, and helps to explain as to why all of the friends have such successful, yet emotionally unfullfilling careers).  They are reunited years later for the funeral of Alexplayed by Kevin Costner, but his acting scenes were deleted), who was considered the best out of the group, but ended his own life in despair.   Sarah (Close) and Harold (Kline) Cooper; now a doctor and businessman respectively, house their friends for the weekend following the funeral. It is this weekend where all of the friends discover how much they need one another and start to mourn their lost ideals from youth.   Meg (Place) is now an attorney; Sam (Berenger) is now a popular TV actor (kind of a  Tom Selleck as ""Magnum P.I.""); Karen (Williams) is now an upper-class mother and housewife catering to her cold husband Richard (Galloway); Nick (Hurt) is a former radio psychologist  now involved in transporting illegal narcotics and following in Alex's footsteps;  and Michael (Goldblum) is now a writer for People Magazine.  Chloe (Tilly) is the younger character who was Alex's last girlfriend and serves to represent the tangible being of what was Alex. The other characters see in her not only the youth that they mourn and remember from college (naiveness, a carefree lifestyle, ""flexability"", etc) but also one of Alex's last attempts at feeling young again (he was much older than her). The musical score is superb and correlates with the drama of each scene perfectly. The opening sequence where each character is learning of Alex's death and traveling to the funeral to the tune of ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" is not only outstanding , but also ingenious in thatit provides the audience a small glimpse into each character's settings in which they all believed they were emotionally happy.  The most famous scene from the film is most likely where the characters dance to ""Ain't To Proud to Beg"" while cleaning the kitchen after dinner.  The symbolism is outstanding in this movie. There are so many levels of symbolism that I cannot even begin to count them all.  The cast is superb, all of the actors deserve equal praise.  This movie is definitely one of the best to come out of the 80's and goes to show the importance that friends have in a person's life",The Big Chill

Some of them had a very strict 50's upbringing and then that just shattered time and time again.They did have the Best America could offer then... Education, Opportunities, Music, Lifestyles, etc... America was on Top then, we had the whole world to ourselves The only thing we were missing was some Transparency with our government, business and race relations.I had to summarize the background of this move to show you how this it sort of wonders on after the Tumultuous 60's & 70's. That generation grew up on a constant state of Shock and Change.... It wasn't till the late 70's till now that the urge for Sameness and Normality would rule. Go to any Shopping Mall, they are all the same now.This movie didn't appear so even till now 2/17/08 When I first saw it there were many current assumptions and the movie just sort of flowed like a dream...But now it is more of long lost memory; I feel sort of disconnected to it.

137,khristal23,I was not impressed . . .,4,8 July 2005,"I was very disappointed by this movie. It did not meet the expectations I had for it based on what other people told me about it. It is basically the story of these college friends who have lost touch since they've been out in the real world. They have had kids, divorces, etc., since they last saw each other. They are brought together again by the tragic death of one of their friends, a member of this group that we never get to know because he is dead as soon as the film starts. They all stay together in the same house for the weekend and talk and talk about life, death, love, etc. They listen to old records. After the weekend is over, they go home. Big deal. The main problem I have with this movie is that there is nothing really going on. It's not really about anything. So, therefore I can't bring myself to feel much sympathy for these people, or even begin to like them or care one way or the other what happens to them because I don't feel like I get to know them. They all have this history with each other which we know nothing of and don't get to know much of. It was a real letdown. So be warned: If you didn't like Sideways or Reality Bites, you will not like this movie. It is the Sideways and the Reality Bites of the 80's. They even do the camcorder thing just like in Reality Bites. The only movie where I appreciated that was Blair Witch.

Just watching these boring characters talk will put you to sleep. The only somewhat interesting character is William Hurt. He is interesting because he has a drug problem. His drug problem is about the only action in the film. No, the drug use is the only scene without mindless talking, so it is all the action in The Big Chill. I did not believe that the director did a good job establishing the characters' past relationships with each other. I felt somewhat cheated that I did not get a sense of how these characters interacted in the past. Wow, the cast still drink, smoke pot, and talk about the old times. They must have loved each other like brothers and sisters in college. The director just assumes, incorrectly that the viewer can relate on how close these characters were. In conclusion, all of the characters stunk besides William Hurt. This movie is supposed to have a point to it. I think that it might be the older you get, the more you cherish the past and question the future. At least that is the point I got after sitting through this mind-numbing talk fest.",The Big Chill

Personally I love it. When I first saw it in high school I had a group of friends who I was very close with and we knew each other as ""Big Chill"" friends. Today I could not tell you where one of them is. What I like about the movie most is the characters. There is something about every character, even Alex, I can relate to, and there is something about every character that reminds me of at least one person I knew in college. The dialog is very real, what would actually be said in that situation. I did not think the movie seemed very ""scripted."" There are some LOL moments, some misty eye moments, some poignant moments, etc... I think anyone who is 30+ has the same questions as the characters in this movie. As a bonus, it simply has the best soundtrack I have ever heard. The songs fit the mood of the movie in general, and the specific scenes perfectly. They are not just songs for the sake of songs. Anytime I hear one of the songs from this film I immediately think ""Big Chill."" Even 22 years after I first saw it, there are some scenes which just resonate so clearly with me. I like the fact the flashback scenes were cut out, I think it is best Alex is left faceless and you still get to know a bit about him. It is also a very well made movie. It fits together like a puzzle. Clues in part A make sense when you get to part B. Overall a great film with a tremendous cast. It is a movie you have to listen and pay attention to in order to get something from it. If all you like is Die Hard type movies, you will not get it. But if you like movies such as Dead Poets Society, Stand By Me, Good Will Hunting, Diner, Breaking Away, etc... watch The Big Chill. By the way, this movie DID NOT rip off Return of Secaucus 7. If you watch the extras of TBC DVD you know the idea for it came in the late 1970's. 1983 is simply the release date of TBC, it was not written, pitched, filmed, and released in one year.

However, hoped to make an impact through teaching.I finally decided to tape the movie last night, primarily because of two ings -- the great 60's music and Tom Berenger. I've recently seen a lot of his late 70's/early 80's movies, and can't get over how handsome he was. When you see him no on October Road, it's hard to believe it's the same person. It's interesting to see how he's evolved as an actor. To echo some other sentiments, you wonder why his career didn't take off, especially after Platoon.Just one question, can it be assumed that after Sam and Karen made love, that that's all they wanted and now she's going back to Richard?

142,Hobbes2,Great soundtrack; nice on location set; great mix of good actors; flat dialogue,6,12 November 2018,"Starting with what I enjoyed the most -- the soundtrack and the set -- both were excellent. Most of the music was from the 60s and each time a song plays, it's a nice break from the dialogue. The soundtrack is an excellent complement to the movie and the acting continues throughout the music. The location is a beautiful antebellum mansion in the midst of the South Carolina low country.
The cast is top notch - a literal collection of accomplished actors, though most were at the early stage in their careers. The plot is a bit loose, with no real climax throughout the film. There is a lot of dialogue and as some reviews I've read refer to it as ""intelligent"", most of it sounded too contrived to me. Yes, there is some use of larger than average words and concepts, but with a group this large, it struck me as odd, how there were almost no interruptions whenever someone was speaking. They were each able to complete their thoughts and everyone seemed to understand everyone. There was rarely more than a single topic discussed at any point in time...rather unusual for a group that large. I would have expected at least a few side conversations, as well as people losing their focus on the conversation and/or speaker. Due to the extended dialogue, I felt the movie dragged at times. In spite of that, I think it's worth watching if you've never seen it, especially if you're a fan of late 60s, mostly Motown, music.",The Big Chill
143,sitchey,Good soundtrack but thats it!,2,19 July 2014,"Best thing about this movie was the soundtrack FACT!! Cant believe I sat through this, just awful. OK you can say some of the acting was OK, but come on where was the script? Bunch of old friends meeting up at a funeral. And sure why not through in my husband can father your baby too??? What the hell was that about for the film? Not really relevant, nor was the fact that one of the guys ran off with the widow nearly 2 days after the funeral! Good product placement for Nike though ;) As said they only thing I enjoyed about this was the soundtrack! Good start with you cant always get what you want by the stones! And that song was poetic as I didn't get the movie I wanted!",The Big Chill
144,hollywood_jack,What a Cast,10,21 November 2017,"One of the best ensemble casts ever gathered together. I love everything about this movie. Great cast, great soundtrack, great script. My first exposure to Lawrence Kasdan was big shocker as a screenwriter for Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies. But barring a couple films here and there I really got to appreciate Kasdan as a filmmaker on his own merits. And this is where it started for me. With a bunch of friends mourning a loss and pining for the past, while listening to the best music ever recorded.",The Big Chill
145,Redamedia,One of the finest films ever made,10,23 November 2004,"Lawrence Kasdan does a remarkable job crafting a realistic, funny, touching, and enjoyable look at a group of people, reunited after the suicide of their friend Alex. Over the course of a weekend, each character is able to evaluate his or her own life, the effects of their friend's death, and how their relationship with that friend changed over the years (additionally, how their relationship with the surviving friends has changed). We all have friends we've known for years and years, but how well do we really stay in touch? What do we assume about our friendships? The Big Chill is a very insightul study on the nature of friendship, and how an unexpected suicide can shake up our reality. The movie also has tremendous performances from a terrific ensemble of actors. Especially compelling was Glenn Close, whose character once had an affair with Alex. This is one of the first films that seamlessly blended in a soundtrack of songs that not only served to move the story, but were also important in their relevance to the era in which they were popular (the time when the friends were at their closest). This is a fabulous, timeless film.",The Big Chill
146,curtclevenger,Shallow maybe. True in essence? You bet.,9,10 December 2000,"After reading some of the comments rendered by the folks that saw this movie, I wonder who actually lived through the times this film is based on and who didn't. Anyone who was idealistic and rebellious at the end of the 60's into the 70's will surely see a bit of themselves in this film. Most of the people that I grew with during this time are now firmly entrenched in the ""establishment"" that as youths they abhorred with all the passion they could muster. It's called growing up, and finding your way to justifying where and who you are.The characters are all products of successful families, who usually ended up being the ones that questioned authority the most anyway. That they themselves are now successful, only leads them to search for what was so important to them in their youth. The fact that the one member of their group that hadn't bought into the system commits suicide leaves them with even more questions.The cast and crew of this movie couldn't have possibly done a better job of capturing the mood and emotion of the time. Every time I watch this film it stirs feelings of longing. Not only because I identify with the story, but because the soundtrack alone brings it all home.",The Big Chill
147,mfogel,One of my all time favorites.,10,10 August 2002,One of William Hurt's best works. The rest of the cast do a fantastic job as well and they seem to jell together very quickly. Anyone who ever had a reunion of any kind can relate to this film. The soundtrack is great also. The seen when Glen Close gets artificially stimulated should not be missed.,The Big Chill
148,StillThere,"The Big Chill holds up well a quarter of a century later, but...",8,3 August 2008,"Twenty-five years after its release, I decided to watch ""The Big Chill"" again. Thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's strong script and fine direction, the superb performances of all cast members, and the beautiful cinematography, I find that it hasn't lost its power to move an audience. Sure, Kevin Kline's less-than-convincing Palmetto State accent sounds rather silly at times, but other than that, what's not to like about this film? The film has held up well; I find suggestions that it is ""dated"" to be untrue and irrelevant, as the film quite accurately reflects the mood and state of our society at the time that it was made. As such, it is a rather beautiful portrait and/or elegant portrayal of life in America in the early 1980s.On the other hand, comparisons with ""The Return of the Secaucus 7"" are probably inevitable for anyone who has seen both of these gems. For me, ""The Return of the Secaucus 7"" is vastly superior in every way: originality, authenticity, humor, and ability to move. As much as I admire Kasdan's entire body of work, John Sayles is the true master of American cinema. The so-called ""star power"" of The Big Chill and the slickness of the production pale in comparison with the rawness and reality that is ""The Return of the Secaucus 7.""Notwithstanding the claims to the contrary, I find it hard to believe that ""The Big Chill"" was written without any knowledge of ""The Return of the Secaucus 7,"" its premise, and its plot. As such, ""The Big Chill"" is something less than a remake - I won't use the word ""plagiarism"" - but there are just too many similarities to allow for sheer coincidence. While this does not necessarily diminish its ability to entertain, it does affect any claim that it is a landmark. It is not.",The Big Chill
149,davequinn-1,My Favorite Movie Ever!,10,5 August 2021,My favorite movie. This movie is the most important coming of age movie in the history of Hollywood.

150,lcbergstedt,ENTERTAINING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING,9,8 December 2002,"I love movies that make you think, that develop the characters thoroughly and that involve great ensemble acting... and this one fills the bill on all scores... the only weak point was the glenn close character asking her husband to father theirfriend's baby via direct sexual contact.    that seemed absurd to me..   otherwise all the characters and the dialog seemed real ..and i wish there were a sequel.. one of my tests for a good film about interesting characters",The Big Chill

So I rented it and made it through the entire thing. Pretty grueling. I kept expecting something to happen. I don't mean a car explosion or anything, just something... It was like an episode of Days of our Lives. A bunch of people talk and talk and screw each other but when it finally and mercifully comes to an end, it's all quite inconsequential. None of the characters seem to care about anything but themselves, and as the viewer, I doubt you'll care about any of them. I wish they'd have introduced the suicidal character before he died, as he would've likely been much more interesting than any of the ones featured. People say the soundtrack is the best part... Unfortunately, I'll never hear The Who's ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" again without connecting it to this film. throw on a record and save yourself from having to sit through this grossly overrated self- righteous snooze-fest.",The Big Chill

Really captured the era, and you really want to know what happens to everyone in the years ahead. I don't understand how this movie could get a low rating. Even high school & college students appreciate this movie, and it is nearly twenty years old. Stayed around for the long haul. It is interesting to see where the actors have gone since this movie was made. The only thing I don't like is that I have to write ten lines for this to be seen by others on this web site.

153,mg174,Thought it was amazing but had a few issues...,9,10 August 2013,"Talky movies - nothing wrong with that - I'm much more into a good banter than a good car chase. This is a movie that's dated only in the clothes they wear - the insights of a life after college and the friends you make in your twenties is still spot on for today. This movie contains some utterly great lines. Um, what's with the sexualising of Glen Close?! I'm being mean but really! Kinda plot less - could have had more of an arc - but not a huge flaw because it puts you in a lovely mood - so engaging. And I would give it all the stars in the world because Jeff Goldblum is completely sexy and lanky and goofy and funny and kooky and hedonistic and smart and engagingly neurotic and intellectual looking - I think he's given the best lines - he is just himself I presume - I adore him, the young him anyway. Yes, I'm being shallow but there is something about him which is completely magnetic, charismatic, unique and lovable. Would have preferred some more explanation - for example WHY was William Hurt's character now a cynical bastard - what exactly happened? Also it seemed a plot hole that they didn't sort out Alex's affairs and help out his relatives?",The Big Chill
154,psykofax,"The perfect soundtrack, the perfect cast, the perfect script...a wonderful movie.",9,8 May 2005,"As a member of Gen-X having just revisited this movie after several years, I have to say that the soundtrack took me down ""memory lane"" in a big way, and may be one of the best things about The Big Chill. My generation's experience with this music is very different than that of my parents', having been force-fed Three Dog Night, The Band, and all the rest as a young child. It remains a part of my psyche, buried deep in the most obscure and remote of my memories. It was fantastic to hear those songs again, in spite of how much my taste in music has changed over the years. A classic is a classic, and the soundtrack is LOADED with them. Music can make or break a movie, and in The Big Chill, the music is an integral part of the film, as important as the cast, the writing and the directing. Its hard to imagine different music, just as it's hard to imagine a different cast. The songs weave in and out of the movie as easily and naturally as the subplots weave in and out of the story.22 years after being dragged to this movie by my parents (who LOVED it), I remain pleasantly surprised at what a good movie it is as a whole, and how much more I liked it as an adult. The acting is brilliant. The writing is excellent. The directing is fantastic. Everything snaps into place in ways that keep you from getting bored, irritated, or otherwise turned off. Sometimes melodramatic, sometimes hilarious, the characters are well-constructed by the writer(s) and beautifully brought to life by the cast. Two hours fly by without dragging, down time, misfires or backfires. The story unfolds in 1983 with a crew of Baby Boomers, college friends brought back together by tragedy, taking stock in their lives as they get reacquainted with each other after many years have passed. The story may be dated, but anyone, no matter their ""generation,"" can find something to relate to in this film. The interpersonal relationships, the individual journeys, and the self-reckoning that comes with the death of a friend... all of us can grasp these concepts and drink them in, get lost in them, feel the pain, and feel the joy. We can relate to it because its themes are timeless... love, loss, sadness, joy, growing up and getting older. This happens to us all.My only real criticism of this picture would be that once in a while the film was a little too poignant and too depressing for my tastes, but only for brief moments. It could be that no one else who sees this film will agree with me, or even notice. That's fine. Opinions...we all have them. For me, it went a little overboard, just a smidgen. This is the only reason I did not give this movie a 10. It is still a wonderful movie. Some might suggest that this ""going overboard"" was what made the movie effective. It was effective, very much so, but for me it was a bit too much from time to time. Once in a while, my heart strings need a rest.However, the music remains the most memorable part of the film. I had to look The Big Chill up on the internet to be reminded of the general story line, but the music has stayed with me all these years, and will remain with me, from the first notes of Joy to the World through the rest of the soundtrack and back. I would watch this movie again, and recommend it to anyone, no matter how cynical they are or what generation they belong to. Its that good.",The Big Chill
155,jpsoule,"Great blend of music, truth and movie-making",10,23 July 2005,"You never realize how good you have it in college, no matter how often you hear those tired old clichés. Clichés like 'these will be some of your best friends, memories and times of your life so enjoy them while you can'. You never believe you are anywhere NEAR as naive or idealistic as your folks or 'elders' keep telling you you are because you firmly believe you know better, heck, you're not a kid anymore. That is until you finally go out beyond those 'ivory towers' and get a 'real job' in that 'cold cruel world' you were warned so often about. This movie reflects on the essence and emotion of this painful realization, but blends it with good 'vibes', without sugarcoating the reality. Anyone who thought they 'knew it all', worked so hard in college (or high school or grad school, etc) and was ready for 'life' only to face a RUDE awakening, will identify with these characters and their situations. This movie leaves you feeling better about life and inspires insight into your own...a very high compliment in my humble opinion.",The Big Chill
156,cmglover,Well worth a look.,9,30 August 2003,"This movie always makes me laugh. It also makes me cry. There is something simple and tragic about this long conversation. My experiences with a gathered group of friends has almost never been this explorational nor vaporous. Despite the sense of comic tragedy associated with the loss of Alex from their lives, these people seem to insist on remaining surprisingly self-absorbed.That does not say that the performances weren't incredible. I believe the strongest of these is Meg Tilly's great showing as the outsider who doesn't understand and yet moves through her grief in her own way. Kevin Kline is excellent as Harold, the ""glue"" of the group. I also felt a wonderful pull from Tom Berenger and William Hurt as they explore their characters and challenge each other from different points of view.The music soundtrack for this film is exceptional and perhaps the most valuable character in the production. Each of the scenes is played out to the backdrop of the vocals and instumentals that formed the characters' (and so many boomers') early lives.A nice film with a good balance of prose and laughs. Not just a feel good film but a film with some things to say. There are a few weak plot points (like Meg's ""ticking clock"" and Nick's impotence) that seemed to be more distracting than anything else. The film is still a very nice entertainment and well worth a spin on the couch twenty years after its premiere. Well worth a look.",The Big Chill

Those ""funny one-liners"" (and there are plenty!) are much more than that: they tell us volumes about the characters. This movie certainly does not spell anything out to the viewer (except, perhaps, the obvious), so you must be able to find the meaning behind the words.  If you listen to what the characters are saying, then you can understand their past relationships, their present feelings, which friends have stayed close, etc.  Remember, these are old friends: the script is very realistic so the characters are not going to explain every line to one another.  I believe to truly enjoy this movie you need to pay close attention to all of the details and understand a bit about the attitudes and ideals of the two eras the movie depicts.Wonderful, intelligent movie!",The Big Chill

The Big Chill made me wish that I had gone to a big university and had a reunion with my best friends years afterwards. This movie struck a chord that stays with me to today. I have watched it many times and still feel the same way at the end as I did the first time I watched it. The ensemble cast seems perfectly assembled and the direction and editing is superb.

I love the depth of William Holden's character. Being a vet and having a life altering injury. As well as the relationship between Glen Close and the deceased and the fact that her husband Kevin Kline makes peace with that relationship. Although a little unrealistic still very fascinating. Jeff Goldblum's character is so shallow but yet he has an unadvertised deepness and sense of humor that only the twisted like myself and Tilly's part understands.

It deals with all of life's battles with growing up and dealing with the separation of your closest friends over time. The acting is solid and the emotions are present. The main reason I suppose I enjoy it so much is how real it is to life. It's not a monster destroying a city, its not an insane story that seems hard to believe, its just life and what happens.

165,super_trooper,Reality staring you in the face,7,1 January 2003,"There was something about this movie which I couldn't place my finger on. Although I barely made the 60's, of which all the characters are reminiscing of and therefore perhaps I maybe missed some subtle messages or didn't get some in-jokes about the 60's, this movie still applies to everyone.  I guarantee every generation will have a time where they come back after 10 or 15 years and see friends that had been so important but are now barely on the radar.  They will have a weekend of drinking and tears and fights and laughter.  You will look at someone and remember a deep, hidden passion for them that you felt so long ago and never shared with anyone.
That is of course, the plot of the movie.7 friends (who go wayyy back) one husband (who disappears pretty quickly) and a widowed girlfriend (who is barely known by anyone) come together after they learn that Alex, a friend formally part of the clique, had committed suicide (this part was infamously played by Kevin Costner).  They have a weekend of sex, drugs, and good ol' fashioned rock and roll, the whole time bringing up past ghosts that had seemed long forgotten and faded.  This is touchy subject, even in today's standards.  Yet the movie handles it beautifully.  My favourite section in the whole movie was when `You can't always get what you want' was played at his funeral.  Not for the song, although it is a classic but for how the characters react.  Each sit there in the church, some smiling quietly to themselves, while others have a sadden expression, remembering great times that were and never will be again.  Every person has a song like that, one that makes you remember your friends, one that makes you sad or laugh and  or grin to yourself as you remember the things you did. That to me clinches the movie.  It shows how true the script is, and how humanly the characters react.  There is a lot of angry hype about the movie, how there is too much talking and not enough sex or car chases or whatever people think is missing.  Yet for me, it is reality.  When something like this happens in real life, people do not over dramatise.  Life is not a soap opera, although movie-goers seemed to want this movie to be.  In a real-life situation, people would do exactly what the characters did, examine themselves and try to find a reason for the problems that have happened.  Yet the hard truth is, especially about suicide, sometimes, there is no one you can blame.  I think people didn't like this movie too much because it rang too true.  It was too realistic. People go the movies to be entertained, to fall in love with the fairy-tales lives that movies have.  This movie is honest.  It seems, for now, people just want to be naïve and live in a fantasy world.  If you want a true movie, see this one now.",The Big Chill

Clever dialogue has lost the innocence its characters never had. The film has become a parody of its times---almost unsettling to watch. It is a kitsch archive of cliché incorrectnesses---the splash then drivels now. This movie provides excellent documentary evidence of the narcissism for which my generation has been roundly and justifiably criticized. The characters work through their disappointments by forming an in-group. They assert their personal wagers against ageing and inevitable maturity by jogging in jeans and listening to R&B. Their escapist attitudes are masked by conspicuous consumption (the unrestricted use of an ante-bellum mansion, the custom delivery of brand name runners and the constant discussion of money-making alternative lifestyles). They have no intention, nor can they even consider embracing a circle of interests above and beyond personal gratification.This movie is corporate America at its best---affirmative groupthink for a complacent, competitive and self-hating middle-class.",The Big Chill

The Big Chill is essentially a remake of this film that came out three years earlier. Return of the Secaucus Seven is about a group of friends who gather after many years to reminisce about their college experience together as political radicals. While not as slick and certainly lacking the star power and soundtrack of The Big Chill, Return of the Secaucus is better written and a better character study. I recommend it if you've enjoyed the later version. John Sayles is a great writer/director.

Hurt's character is obviously the next member of the tribe in major trouble and just as the group was impotent with Alex, so too will they be impotent with Hurt .. their weekend of ""consciousness raising"" went awash between concerns of money and business, social/professional status, kinky sex, and issues of conventional marriage.

After seeing the movie, several co-workers told me that I just HAD to see it because they knew I would like it. Well, I didn't see it until early 1985, in Sioux Falls, SD, at a 'second run' theatre. I was so overwhelmed that I actually cried several times during the movie (which may have been because my friend and I drank 2 pitchers of beer while watching it). Whatever the reason, after that, I watched it at every opportunity available, even setting my alarm clock for ungodly times in the middle of the night to get up and turn the TV on. (This was many years before I owned a VCR, you have to realize.) I even ""watched"" it on cable channels I didn't have; sometimes I could see it and sometimes I could only hear it, yet I was up watching it in the middle of the night! To this day, I still can't NOT watch it if I see it's on TV, even though I have two copies of my own. Although I quit counting the number of times I've seen it several years ago at 47, I have an annual ritual of watching it on New Year's Eve, just in case I didn't see it during that year.I know I'm prejudiced, but I don't understand why people give it negative ratings. I don't think it's whiny, and the narratives (talk, talk, talk) are what make the movie, along with the sound track, of course.

172,powderhound-3,I'm too young so maybe I don't understand,8,27 September 2005,"I think there was a segment of America that may have dabbled on the edge of ""Hippieness"" without being hardcore activist, free love and so on. My parents were mid western wallflowers living through the same things at the same time but sticking to the status quo Christian right. The characters in this film seem like they were mostly privileged kids who attended a university and dabbled in some of the trends of the era. Being big Michigan football fans doesn't fall into what would be a ""hippy"" way to spend time. They listen to more R&B type tunes as opposed to the Jefferson Airplane,Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin (to name a few). They may have felt they were part of the ""movement"" by having a sit in at the Ann Arbor cafeteria for better vegetarian lunch options. There isn't enough background given to decide if they are hippies or not. I'm sure there were plenty of people smoking grass who weren't hippies. This is a great movie that really makes you think about your life whether you grew up in the 60's or the 90's. There is a common thread that can be identified with no matter what your age. The performances are stellar because the interaction and caring between characters is so real. I highly recommend it I enjoy this movie every time I see it.",The Big Chill

The characters are great and everyone can relate deeply to at least one. Witty, smart, intelligent, and fun, this movie never has a dull moment. It shows the importance of success but most of all, family and friends. It's a great family movie OR a flick to watch partying with good friends. A must see!A group of college friends are reunited for a funeral of a college friend who committed suicide, which turns into a weekend party/reunion. All are very successful but obviously flawed. From a businessman having less than ethical practices, to an alcoholic actor, to control freak doctor, a miserable/loose housewife, to a lonely attorney who's abandoned her values, a former psychologist who's turned to fast cars and drugs, a womanizing professionally frustrated writer, to a clueless 20 year old.

174,Ahyoo,Cannot love this movie enough!,8,4 February 2006,"I found this movie by searching for all William Hurt performances. Yes, there was a period of time that I just didn't think anybody is better than Bill Hurt. (Hey, he is been nominated for best support this year for Oscar! I wonder whether he will walk the red-carpet. He has said openly that he hates it.) Then, of course I fall in love with this movie immediately. Great cast, acting, writing, directing, music and everything about a sweet feeling we all have for old friends, and something we all would like to go back to revisit. Hurt's performance is once again interestingly intriguing. Close is as good as always. Tilly is always surprising. And after this movie, I watched several other movies by Mary Kay Place and liked her very much. Some people suggested to make a sequel while all these actors are still active. I agree with it 100% and I will be the first in line to see it.And if you noticed where I am living now, you'd understand it is sweet to hear all the movie characters talking about Ann Arbor and University of Michigan. Hey.....",The Big Chill
