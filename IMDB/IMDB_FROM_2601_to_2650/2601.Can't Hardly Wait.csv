0,SnoopyStyle,Competent 90's teen comedy,6,22 October 2013,"The high school seniors have just graduated, and they're having a blowout final party. Preston Meyers (Ethan Embry) is hopelessly infatuated with Amanda Beckett (Jennifer Love Hewitt). When she's dumped by her douche jock boyfriend Mike Dexter (Mike Dexter), Preston can't hardly wait to proclaim his love for Amanda.It's nice to see some familiar faces when they were young. Ethan Embry does a pretty amiable teen. Jennifer Love Hewitt does this hurt face throughout the movie. She's hurt by the break up. She's hurt by the douche boyfriend's attitude. Then she goes nuclear on everybody. The best has to be perpetually short-tempered outsider Lauren Ambrose, and the over-compensating Seth Green. However it's all too familiar. In the end, it's hard to see what Preston actually sees in Amanda other than an object on an unachievable pedestal. Does he really know her? She doesn't even know who his name. They probably never had two words together.",Can't Hardly Wait
1,BA_Harrison,What a cast!,8,8 August 2019,"At a post-graduation house party, Preston Meyers (Ethan Embry) tries to pluck up the courage to tell school hottie Amanda Beckett (Jennifer Love Hewitt) how he feels about her, with the help of a love-letter four years in the writing. Meanwhile, Preston's best pal, misfit Denise (Lauren Ambrose), gets frisky with an old friend.The lovelorn high-schooler desperately trying to get with the girl of his dreams is a teen comedy cliché, but while this might not be the most original example of the genre, or necessarily the funniest, it succeeds in being a very charming little movie, helped immensely by an engaging group of characters, with a standout cast of familiar '90s faces.Among the revellers are Clea Duvall (who always seemed like more of the misfit type to me), Jerry O'Connell as a jock loser, Melissa Joan Hart, Jaime Pressly, Jason Segel and Chris 'The Shermanator' Owen, as well as all four members of Josie and the Pussycats boy-band Du Jour: Seth Green, Alexander Martin, Breckin Meyer, and Donald Faison (the last two playing members of a band called Loveburger). Jenna Elfman (Dharma & Greg) also turns up in the film as a sexy stripper in an angel costume.With such a great ensemble and solid handling by writers/directors Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, the result is a fun reminder of the joys of youth and the trials and tribulations of first love.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Can't Hardly Wait
2,edwagreen,Can't Hardly Wait for this to Be Over **,4,30 January 2013,"Those who make these ridiculous teen-age pictures which is supposed to show the coming of age after high school graduation do a disservice to the youth out there. High school is shown as one big preparation to graduate and drink the night away and that college shall be a 24/7 non-stop continuation of this.As in all these type of films, we have an assortment of characters where Joe College usually winds up behind the egg-ball at film's end and love is realized by others.Enough of the wild parties at a graduate's home. How convenient that the parents aren't home.These pictures really lack substance when you think about it.",Can't Hardly Wait
3,BandSAboutMovies,Not all that bad.,5,29 September 2020,"Ah, the late 1990's, when teen comedies came back for a while. What a simpler time than today, trapped in our homes and constantly waiting for the inevitable next chapter of the end of all things. Or something, right?This is where the career of so many of your favorite stars began. You can literally play spot the star here.Figuring that the best part of teen movies were the party scenes, this movie is basically one long party scene. I guess that's the way to do it, as hijinks ensue movies off a meager set-up are so much of what I watch.While it takes it's title from The Replacements song, it really doesn't have much to do with the song (other than featuring it in the credits).Ethan Embry and Jennifer Love Hewitt are the main stars here, star-crossed lovers who absoutely must come together for the good of the story. Along the way, there are many last night - when high school seemed like the end all, be all of our existence - moments that must have a resolution before college begins.That said, this film smartly sets up that yesterday's cool senior is tomorrow's geek freshman. This lesson would serve you well for your entire life, reminding you that you must continually prove yourself.Of course, Clea Duvall's Jana is my favorite character, although I find the fact that she ended up hooking up with Steth Green's Kenny to be out of character. That said, high school is about being out of character.Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont would go on to make Josie and the Pussycats, a movie that's way better than it has any right to be.",Can't Hardly Wait

Love struck dork Preston Myers (Ethan Embry) , gathers his courage to act on his long time feelings for former prom queen Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt). This crowd of mostly horny teens all have different agendas for their life. Some laughable situations. In spite of its stupidity, an enjoyable flick.My main reason for watching is Lauren Ambrose, a sensible loner, who shares cast credits with Seth Green, Sean Patrick Thomas, Selma Blair, Peter Facinelli and Charlie Korsmo.",Can't Hardly Wait
5,preppy-3,Fun teen movie,8,1 December 2017,"This mostly takes place at a huge party thrown for a bunch of kids after they graduate from high school. The movie focuses on a few of them. Amanda (Jennifer Love-Hewitt) and Mike (Peter Facinelli) have been together since 9th grade but break up just before graduation. This gives nice guy Preston (Ethan Embry) a shot at her--but he's going away the next day. He also has a perpetually depressed friend Denise (Lauren Ambrose). Then there's William (Charlie Korsmo) a super nerd who has always been tormented by Mike--and plans to take his revenge at the party. Then there's Ken (Seth Green) a white boy who likes to pretend he's black.This got good reviews when it came out and it's easy to see why. It's a surprisingly fun teen movie. It's colorful, has a great soundtrack and a very fun and witty script. There's also good acting by the entire cast and it's fun to see what some of these people went on to do. Love-Hewitt, Facinelli and Embry are still going strong. Also there's an uncredited appearance by Jenna Elfman. A fun, enjoyable teen movie.",Can't Hardly Wait
6,Calicodreamin,This cast is everything,7,24 January 2021,"Gotta love the awesome 90s vibes and all star cast. There isn't a plot, but it doesn't really matter. Just one raucous house party with hilarious antics and a warm fuzzy ending.",Can't Hardly Wait
7,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Look at it this way... at least it's not the train-wreck 'Josie and the Pussycats' was,6,21 May 2005,"See-through, predictable teen-romance-comedies... don't we have enough of them by now(if not far too many)? Apparently not according to Hollywood. They keep churning them out, anyway. This one suffers from the typical problems associated with these films, and some more. The lead, Ethan Embry, clearly isn't charismatic or interesting enough to carry the film on his shoulders, so the writers had to come up with about five dozen more main characters, none of which have any real substance or are any more than tired stereotypes. The plot is contrived and uncreative, with every single old arch-type and cliché thrown in the audiences faces. The love-story is thin and vapid. None of the characters are likable or well-developed. The acting is acceptable. Now, what this film really benefits from is the very high number of recognizable teen star faces. Just about every major teenage actor(well, actor in early 20's who's portrayed a teenager) is in this, though most have very minor roles. The humor is fairly daft. The timing is often off, and many of the punchlines are overplayed. Not really anything else to say... one to avoid, unless you're a fan of the genre, I suppose. I recommend this only to big fans of the genre and people who are dying to see all the teen actors in one film together. Everyone else should probably just skip it. 6/10",Can't Hardly Wait
8,Uriah43,One Last Fling After Graduation,6,22 February 2019,"This film essentially begins on the last day of high school where upon graduation everybody decides to have a party at a house where the parents of a student have gone away for the weekend. Yet as excited as everyone is to have finally completed high school one particular item of interest on everybody's mind is the fact that the most popular athlete ""Mike Dexter"" (Peter Facinelli) has just broken up with the most popular female student ""Amber Beckett"" (Jennifer Love Hewitt). To that end, all of the guys lust after Amber and hope to take advantage of the breakup for their own selfish purposes at this party. Mike, on the other hand, has made a few enemies along the way with one particular student by the name of ""William Lichter"" (Charlie Korsmo) especially intent upon gaining a certain amount of revenge upon him at this same party. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly enjoyable high school comedy which featured several humorous scenes along the way. I especially liked the performance of Seth Green (as ""Kenny Fisher"") who I dominated this film for the most part. Be that as it may, while this clearly wasn't the best ""high school comedy"" I have ever seen it had its moments and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Can't Hardly Wait
9,anaconda-40658,Can't Hardly Wait for It to Be Over.,3,30 June 2015,"Can't Hardly Wait (1998): Dir: Deborah Kaplan, Harry Elfont / Cast: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ethan Embly, Lauren Ambrose, Seth Green, Jenna Elfman: Teen comedy about moving onto the next stage of life. It centres around a party where sex and loud music are the norm. Jennifer Love Hewitt is tired of countless sexual innuendos and Ethan Embly is a love struck graduate who has kept a hand written love letter for four years in hopes of giving it to her. Film serves as another example of teens viewed as sex starved alcoholics. Predictable tripe directed by two people, which is perhaps the film's biggest surprise. Their names are Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont who do well in a sequence in which a note transcends about a room. Unfortunate a decent script never floated about the set or this might have been better than the concocted formula crap that it became. Hewitt basically sits and looks pretty while Embly bellows and wails about his urge to share his feelings. It is obvious that they will connect and that Hewitt will look at him with starry eyes. Lauren Ambrose and Seth Green dislike each other and are trapped in a washroom until they finally put differences aside for sexual conquests. Then there is Jenna Elfman making a ridiculous cameo as an angel who hasn't anything better to do. With its total lack of anything original, I can't hardly wait for studios to quit producing crap like this. Score: 3 / 10",Can't Hardly Wait
10,thesar-2,Maybe I Shouldn't Have Waited,8,10 April 2016,"I can't hardly believe it took me this long to see this for the first time. I mean, I love the 90sand this was sooo the 90s. I guess I'm warming up to house party movies. If they're done right, i.e. 2012's Project X was an abomination. But, recently, I watched the 2016 house party-themed Sisters and loved almost every minute of it. Going back almost 20 years, and I felt the same here for Can't Hardly Wait.Sure, it's typical – even for 1998 standards, and you know how some of the multiple stories will play out, but the interactions, the genuine comedy and dialogue mixed in with everyone's great chemistry and this movie stands above most house party films.Graduation night brings together multiple groups of just released high school students into a late night party where pretty much everyone reminisces about other people's memories dating back as far as the second grade. If they were sad to let it all go and move onto to their college lives spread across the country, they didn't show it. Most everyone was having a blast. Well, maybe not Yearbook Lady. Or the host.Oh, and there's a main thread of a plot: Normal Preston has had a crush on recently separated and popular Amanda and works his way through the film to find the courage to confess his stalking to her. Er, I mean, love.It's a good movie with an incredible number of recognizable faces in the background – always love an early sighting of Jason Segel and always had a girl-crush on Clea DuVall. And there were many more people I loved from the 90s. In fact, this is the perfect 90s nostalgia film, speaking of reminiscing, myself. I mean, just listen to the soundtrack***Final thoughts: I probably would have never seen this movie had I not missed two questions of a ninety-nineties movie trivia game and both incorrect answers were from this movie. So, I guess that wasfate.",Can't Hardly Wait
11,tabuno,"An Above Average ""Animal House""",7,25 January 2019,"7 March 2004. This ""Animal House"" update brings more intelligence, more meaning to a dumb period of college partying. The focus on selected characters and the relationship are both entertaining and enlightening. In addition to the somewhat less raucous but much more intelligent college party - ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is both a fun movie that balances both dumb antics with meaningful interludes between the characters.Seth Green from Buffy the Vampire Slayer offers up a different and rather deeper character demonstrating his flexibility as an actor and Jennifer Love Hewitt portrays a reluctant Prom Queen misunderstood - in an anti-popularity role. The memorable aspect of this movie is in its balanced treatment of the post-high school experience, avoiding the raw, idiotic nonsense of Animal House and bringing a much more rewarding entertaining experience to the audience.",Can't Hardly Wait

I love everything about Can't Hardly Wait, the soundtrack, writing is nicely done, the way it was filmed, eccentric scenes, and wonderful vibe!

13,Rectangular_businessman,A typical nineties teen comedy,5,28 September 2012,"""Can't Hardly Wait"" summarizes perfectly well every single cliché and archetype from any of the teen comedies done in the nineties. Not That this is a bad thing, and think that I prefer the clichés from the teen movies made in that decade than most of the awful and unfunny comedies from the recent years.Even when some of the references in ""Can't Hardly Wait"" could considered ""dated"" by modern audiences, and despite the fact that the story from this film is totally stereotypical and predictable, at least it still has a certain level of entertainment value to be worth-watching.Personally, I'd rather see a movie like this than stuff like ""Project X"" any day.",Can't Hardly Wait
14,pmtelefon,Fun Stuff,8,31 March 2018,"Maybe I'm a little too hard on teen movies. After watching most of the '80s teen flicks maybe I think I've seen it all. Forgive me.

If I was twenty five years younger it would be great.",Can't Hardly Wait
15,Anonymous_Maxine,A surprise classic!,8,17 March 2008,"I just read a review of Can't Hardly Wait on the IMDb by a user who mentioned that he has walked by the movie in his local video store countless times before finally renting it. Personally, I saw it countless times when it was released because I worked at a video store at the time, but it is probably the one movie that I have been ""meaning"" to write a review about since I started writing reviews on the IMDb nearly ten years ago. The teen comedies, especially the ones that use losing virginity as major plot devices, are an intolerable lot almost without exception. This one, however, is definitely an exception. Everything is blown out of proportion from what high school is really like (and I went to a ridiculously rich high school, so I know what it's like to party in multi-million dollar mansions while the parents (someone else's, of course) are away), but it's blown out of proportion in all the right ways. It's hard to pinpoint what it is that makes this movie work while so many other movies like it fail completely, because it does have a lot of the same flaws. Granted, I should be a little careful, because I haven't seen the movie in at least six years and it's dangerous to review a movie I haven't seen for that long (the movies that I thought were cool when I was in high school are now sometimes shockingly bad), but while this is certainly not a family movie or a critic's movie, for its target audience it can definitely serve as some pretty good fun.It's true that Can't Hardly Wait doesn't remotely approach the honesty and importance of the classic high school films, like Say Anything or The Breakfast Club, and it's also true that most of the characters (almost all, in fact) are comic caricatures of the traditional high school types, but the movie never pretends to be anything more than that. I think it understands that it's a joke, and so it just has fun with itself, and with the right state of mind we can have a blast along with it.Seth Green is the white kid who thinks he's black, and he pulls off the accent and the behavior remarkably well. So well, in fact, that for a while I thought he might be typecast like Sean Penn was for a while by Fast Times (another classic) and Keanu Reeves was by Bill & Ted (Keanu had a much harder time shaking that image, but he has definitely done it by now. Peter Facinelli is good as Mike Dexter (his most memorable role before or since), the cool kid with the hot girlfriend who has an agreement with his friends to break up with their high school girlfriends so they can graduate to college women. Unfortunately, he's the only one who goes through with it, and thus enters poor Jennifer Love Hewitt, who mopes and moans through most of her role, one of the only boring and totally uninteresting parts of the movie. Even her goofy future-sorority-girl girlfriends are more entertaining. Then again, Hewitt's character, as it is, doesn't belong in this movie, she belongs in a movie that takes itself a little more seriously, and even then she should be played by someone else. But the real highlight is Charlie Korsmo as William Lichter, the geeky kid trying desperately with his Star Wars buddies to get into a cool party and sabotage it. While his buddies wait on the roof acting out their favorite Star Wars scenes, William proceeds to get drunk and ultimately give us the best scene in the movie, a heroic live performance of Guns N' Roses' Paradise City in front of the whole party, who finally begin to see him in a new light. Strangely, Korsmo hasn't acted since this movie.There is another character named Denise Fleming who spends most of the movie locked in a bathroom with Kenny Fisher (Seth Green), with whom she used to be close friends until he became, as they say, too cool for her. Their conversation is the most realistic and heartwarming thing in the movie, it's always been confusing to me why the writers locked her in a bathroom for the whole movie. Probably to give her and Kenny enough time to have their heart-to-heart chat, ""etc.""It's easy to badmouth a movie like this. It has many of the stereotypes of your typical high school comedy, and the situations and the structure that the writers have created are often ludicrous in the extreme. The movie's target audience may not be as big as the truly successful coming of age films, but the target audience is richly rewarded with this movie. It's about 100 times better than American Pie, for example. Unlike that movie, there are no cringe-inducing scenes, no stomach-turning toilet humor, and no conspicuously shaped holes in any apple pies. This movie is just good fun!",Can't Hardly Wait
16,dee.reid,I couldn't hardly believe it but...,7,25 July 2005,"...This is actually one of the most entertaining teen comedies I've seen yet. In the post-John Hughes teen era, 1998's underrated multi-character comedy, ""Can't Hardly Wait,"" a joint venture by directors Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, is funny and engaging in a way most teen comedies aren't anymore. This is a movie I've seen a fair number of times over the years but I have to admit a particular fondness for the characters, despite an uneven script and other writing issues, as it brings back memories of my high school career, which I left in June of 2004.In the movie, Denise Fleming (Lauren Ambrose) reminds the audience that ""fate works in some really {expletive} ways sometimes"" - we get rebuffed every time we want something to happen but doesn't. But sometimes life cuts us a break and that's what would happen for Lonely Guy Preston Meyers (Ethan Embry). For four long years, Preston has pined for Amanda Beckett (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who is of course the pretty cheerleader and has conveniently ended her relationship with her idiot jock boyfriend Mike Dexter (Peter Facinelli). In the opening sequences, Preston explains the circumstances regarding his ""fateful"" relationship with Amanda. An aspiring writer, Preston has revised and revised a soul-bearing love letter that will confess to Amanda the feelings and reasons for why they were destined to be together despite life elements that have proved otherwise. Preston plans to give her the letter at a post-graduation party the night before he's scheduled to leave for Boston. And of course, a number of circumstances and misunderstandings will hamper Preston's dogged determination to give Amanda his letter. But before one writes this off as a typical teen romance, please let me continue...Even more interesting, are the various subplots taking place paralleled next to the main plot line. Mike Dexter isn't exactly the most cherished individual in high school, as explained by William Lichter (Charlie Korsmo), in a verbal tirade that parodies Bill Pullman's inspirational speech from ""Independence Day"" (1996). Along with his two geek buddies, William plans to lure Mike and one of his random jock friends to the pool house, take Polaroids, and capture them in a ""naked embrace."" However, circumstances allow William to become the unlikely life of the party. Meanwhile, wannabe homeboy Kenny Fisher (Seth Green), plans to ""sex as many honies"" as possible at this party. He's got the full kit in his backpack, including the ""Kama Sutra,"" the Hindu book of love. But his plans take a backseat when he's locked in the upstairs bathroom with Denise. It is here that the two former friends, now strangers, confront one another about the drastic changes their lives have taken since junior high, and it is this portion of the script that comes to be the most interesting, largely because of the interaction between Ambrose and Green. In addition to these, there are plenty of smaller subplots including a foreign exchange student, the party hostess as she tries to control the night's events (as well as her sanity), a yearbook geek (Melissa Joan Hart) who wants to be the first to get the signature of every graduating senior, William's nerd buddies who are on top of the pool house, and a band called Loveburger (fronted by Breckin Meyer) tries to get its act together but in-fighting nearly proves to be the group's demise. Boy, it's going to be one hell of a night...Despite its script problems, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is sure to get some kind of a cult following in a few years, which of course comes from the fact that the subplots are far more interesting than the core story. But I dismiss it as nothing truly detrimental to the film as a whole. Of course, my favorite story just happens to be the one with Amanda and Lonely Guy Preston. (I guess it's because I more or less fall into the category of high school Lonely Guys who pine for the pretty girl but don't get the pretty girl.) Yet, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" obviously can't hardly wait for some kind of cult fame over the next couple of years.7/10",Can't Hardly Wait
17,Coxer99,Can't Believe I've Seen This Before...,5,17 March 1999,"A graduating class reunites in this unoriginal look at an end of the year high school bash. It's a 90's version of ""American Graffiti,"" with all the stars having a heart to heart with themselves before they go off to college and be snobby someplace new.

18,estebangonzalez10,Can't Hardly Age Well,4,7 December 2015,"""Don't look back. You should never look back.""There is a scene during the movie where someone spray painted ""This Party Sucked"" on the door, and I guess that the same thing can be said about this predictable and formulaic teen comedy that tries way too hard to capture the spirit of former John Hughes' comedies from the 80's. Perhaps it is my fault that I just got around watching this film now, but if that is the case all I can say is that it hasn't aged well considering many films since have done a much better job at delivering laughs and breaking genre conventions. Can't Hardly Wait is completely predictable from start to finish and the characters all fall flat despite some charismatic performances from the cast. The script may be the biggest disappointment because the characters aren't given anything interesting to say and they all play generic characters. This was Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan's first feature film as directors, and they only went on to direct one other movie together (Josie and the Pussycats). Can't Hardly Wait was received quite well in the late 90's, but I can't see its appeal. It feels like a generic teen comedy about teenagers partying after graduation. They all promise to be memorable, but in the end everything that goes on in the party is completely predictable. There are fun moments, but the film never justifies it 100 minute runtime. Jennifer Love Hewitt plays the girl everyone in school loves and admires, but she has recently been dumped by her boyfriend, played by Peter Facinelli, who wants to move on and meet college girls now. Their breakup is the talk of the school, and Ethan Embry's Preston believes fate has given him another shot to talk to the girl of his dreams. Preston has always been in love with Amanda (Hewitt), but she doesn't even know of his existence. We find out about his secret crush for Amanda through his best friend, Denise (Lauren Ambrose), who he confides in. Other people we meet at the party are the classic characters we've seen in many other 80's and 90's teen comedies: some of the hot shot athletes who are best friends with Mike (Facinelli), their gorgeous girlfriends who are part of Amanda's group, the rockstar wannabes, and the nerds who want to avenge all the years of bullying they've endured. Charlie Korsmo gives one of the most funny performances as this nerd who after drinking a bit too much becomes the sensation of the party. There is also a side plot involving Denise getting locked up in the bathroom with Kenny Fisher (Seth Green), someone who she shared a past with but hasn't been in contact since. Locked up together in the bathroom seems like a good way to dig up the past and they both open up with each other. The side stories and secondary characters are actually more interesting than the actual main plot involving Hewitt and Embry's relationship and that is what ultimately hurt the film for me. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Can't Hardly Wait

Nearly every scene had me going ""He/she is in this too?"". It was fun to see them here at the dawn of their respective careers with almost no obvious pretense on display. The film itself is riddled with the genre's many time tested (or worn, depending on your point of view) clichés, and the characters and their respective stories are wafer thin--even for a teen comedy--but despite this there's zip to its pacing and an enlivening charm from its cast that lifts the material. If you like the genre, if you have a nostalgia for that late 90s pop fizz era, then you'll probably enjoy this one.",Can't Hardly Wait

While I would not rank this anywhere NEAR as good as fast times at Richmond high, The Breakfast Club, some kind of wonderful or Clerks-to name a few, the movie, Can't hardly wait, is mildly funny at times and is good for a few laughs. Some of the things that happen to these characters will be familiar to viewers when recollecting their own high school years. The movie, however, breaks no new ground and doesn't have any particularly memorable lines or unforgettable characters which is it's weakest aspect. There are a lot of teen movies which deal with these same story lines that just do it better. The ending was a bit hollow, a bit rushed-but this movie is decent enough to pass the time, though not remarkable and you could do worse with this genre(much much worse). All in all it rates about average or a 5.5 or so.

23,Movie-ManDan,Much Better Than Most Others in this Genre.,7,15 April 2017,"There's a total of about 15 minutes in this film that does not take place during the time of the most out of control high school party of the year. Party central is an isolated place where recent high school graduates raise hell and where they all learn more about themselves. What makes this so much different and better than most party films is how well it knows to handle...almost everything!Several high schoolers star in their own stories that make this film what it is. We get to care about these characters right away. They're not super deep that they're Oscar material, but still deeper than most in other flicks. There's four major stories: Seth Green plays a wigger desperate to have sex and gets locked in the bathroom with Lauren Ambrose's character (who some people think is the only smart one). There's no telling when they get together and break up, only that they do it many times. Charlie Korsmo stepped out of retirement for one last hurrah before having a decorated education. He plays the geek of the class named William. He and his two other geeky friends have a plan to crash the party for revenge, but he just gets loaded and becomes a ladies man. The heart of the film involves Jennifer Love-Hewitt's character named Amanda. Her longtime high school boyfriend, the jock and pretty-boy of the class just broke up with her to date college girls. Meanwhile Preston, who has always had the hots for her and believes in fate, is ready to make his move on her. This is the bulk of the film where the needed seriousness comes from.All of the songs used in this film are awesome. Some are new, and some are old, some are rock, some are pop. There's a variety, unlike nowadays party films that strictly go by dance tunes from the past year. But most importantly, the film knows exactly what to do with these characters and exactly how to make them and their situations likable. They are so much more than your average dumb party-goers. Love-Hewitt's story is the best, but Korsmo's is the funniest. It is his best performance.3/4",Can't Hardly Wait
24,ctomvelu1,Sleep aid,4,23 November 2010,"Badly dated teen party flick that might have played better in the 1980s. Ethan Embry goes to a high school graduation party in a private home where he encounters Jennifer Hewitt, whom he has loved since childhood. He spends most of the movie trying to find a way to approach her. She, on the other hand, has just broken up with the class jock and is besieged at the party by an army of guys looking to hook up. Why she stays as long as she does is a mystery, but it makes for a convenient finale when Embry finally catches up with her. Dullsville. Blandsville. A more interesting storyline has supernerd Seth Green getting stuck in a bathroom with chubby classmate Lauren Ambrose. They have never been particularly fond of one another. So they argue and fight, then they make out, then -- well, you will have to see the movie for the rest. But frankly, I wouldn't bother.",Can't Hardly Wait
25,gangstahippie,Great teen film,8,7 March 2008,"Rated PG-13 for teen drinking and sexuality, and for language.Can't Hardly Wait is a great teen movie.I watched it yesterday because I love the teen comedy genre.Can't Hardly Wait is a film that is very funny at times but it also realistic and sad as well.The film follows a bunch of graduates at a party.One of them wants to find this girl who recently broke up with her jock boyfriend and express his love for her.He has been lusting after her since the beginning of high school.There are three geeks who want to get revenge on the jock.One of the geeks goes to the party to lure him out but eventually has a good time, gets drunk, popular and befriends the jock for a brief period of time.There are also two people who were friends when they were younger but now dislike each other who get locked in a bathroom.Cant Hardly Wait is a funny, interesting and realistic portrayal of high school and if you like teen films, you wont want to miss this.",Can't Hardly Wait
26,michaeltrivedi,Nah,4,2 January 2020,This movie was darker than I thought. I thought it would be some sappy comedy love teen movie like 10 Things. I wouldn't say anything good about it from what I saw. Except it was rather dark. I am curious what they did with that.Not worth my time4 stars,Can't Hardly Wait
27,baumer,Much much better than Never Been Kissed,7,28 June 1999,"I am a product of the 80's slasher film and the teenage film generation. Films in the 80's like Fast Times, Wild Life, Revenge of the Nerds and Ferris Bueller's Day Off and such, were films that may not have been classics to the critics, but to a fifteen year old boy, they were our Citizen Kane.  They taught us how to pick up women, how to attempt to have sex, how to skip school and why to skip school.  They taught us that parents and adults really don't understand us and that kids really aren't that bad, we just want to have a bit of fun before life gets too serious.  We have all been through emotions and experiences like the ones that those movies preach about, so it is easy for us to relate to what those films are trying to say. And it makes it that much more fun to relive those experiences ten years later.  Can't Hardly Wait is the closest to an 80's teen film that I have seen in quite some time.  Compared to films like the aforementioned Never Been Kissed and even She's All That, this movie is a classic.The film was written and directed by Harry Elfont and Debra Kaplan, and if they are not about my age ( late 20's ) they certainly are lovers of 80's teen films, because it shows here that they did their homework.  Some of the scenes in this film are complete homages to great 80's films like Sixteen Candles ( the two geeks on the roof ) Wild Life ( a huge party where some of the characters grow up and learn a bit about themselves and each other) and even Say Anything ( a not so popular guy in love with the school hotty.) It seems to me that Harry and Debra are lovers of the films that made growing up in the eighties so much fun.The story is about a party on the day of the completion of exams.  Here we meet all the major players in the film.  And yes, they are all contrived, but that is what a film like this is about.  They were not trying to re-invent the wheel here, they were trying to stick to a formula that made so many movies work. You have Amanda Beckett ( Hewitt ), the prom queen that just got broken up with by the star jock named Mike Dexter ( played with so much zeal by Peter Facinelli, look for him to have a future in Hollywood ).  Then you have Preston ( Ethan Embry ) who is not necessarily a geek but he is far from a popular jock, think of Dawson.  Anyway, he has loved Amanda for all of highschool and now he is finally getting the guts to tell her of his undying passion for her.  You also have William Lichter, who is the school geek that comes of age in the party.  He does all the things that you would expect a typically written geek in a film to do--- get drunk, have a public display of wildness that gets people to see him in a new light, and of course, in here it is his karaoking to Paradise City ( which is one of the film's funnier scenes ) and of course get laid.  As I said, this movie sticks to a very popular formula.  Don't look for a film like this to say new and something profound about today's youth.  This movie is here to entertain and that is it.  And it does that well.Also you have Kenny Fischer ( Seth Green ) as a very white guy who thinks he is black to cover up his insecurities, and his friend from public school named Denise.  Needless to say many issues are going to be raised at the party and some of them are hilarious.A great cameo is turned in by Jerry O'Connell who plays Trip McNeely ( the ultimate jock name ).  He was idolized by all the cool kids when he went to their high school.  Now he is in university and according to him , in a converstion with Mike Dexter, he tells him that "" guys like me and you bro are a dime a dozen.  Chicks are a lot different in college.  They care about the environment and things and they all date guys that are in pre-med. "" It is a very funny scene.What makes this movie so much fun to watch is that it is reminiscent of an 80's film.  And that is the highest compliment that I can give it. Because, just like they don't know how to make movies like Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street anymore, they sure as hell don't know how to make films like Breakfast Club, The Sure Thing and Secret Admirer.  But this film comes really close to being like those.  And if you remember those ones as films that were some of your favorites when you were sixteen, see this, it will make you laugh and entertain you, and that is an accomplishment on its own.",Can't Hardly Wait
28,Victor Field,"Can't Hardly Like, either...",4,17 December 2000,"I knew that Melissa Joan Hart, Jerry O'Connell and Jenna Elfman were all uncredited, but I had no idea that Liv Tyler's voice was off the credits as well. If only they had all had the wrong idea.There have been quite a few good teen flicks in the past few years, but ""Can't Hardly Wait"" isn't one of them. Admittedly it did get better in the second half once the messy first bit was over, but apart from Jennifer Love Hewitt (the only reason, to be honest, that I checked it out on Sky Moviemax - in addition to bombing in America, it never got a British theatrical release), the only other performer to make it through intact was Seth Green. But then he always delivers the goods. Grating ""humour"" and a soundtrack that, unlike ""She's All That,"" is not something I can imagine teenagers today checking out, does not a good movie make. Skip it unless you're a major JLH fan or want to see how many cast members from other teen flicks or TV shows you can spot (and there are quite a few).",Can't Hardly Wait
29,gbheron,Poor Rehash of Better Movies,5,23 July 2000,"I read the comments and it appears that teenagers love this movie. So I'll give a boomer's eye view. It stinks. It's a poor rehash of much better movies like American Graffiti, Fast Times, Dazed and Confused, et al.
CHW is a story of unrequited love set at a suburban high school graduation party (of the unchaperoned variety). All the stock characters are there, and they do the stock things you would expect. It is all excruciatingly predictable and shallow. If you are not an American high school graduate from the years 1997-2000 you would do well to avoid this movie.",Can't Hardly Wait
30,TOMASBBloodhound,"If nothing else, at least this film has Jaime Pressly.",8,13 March 2004,"Although not in the same class as The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, or even Better Off Dead, this is still a highly effective teen movie. It's really the only teen movie made in the last 15 years or so that I keep in my collection.The plot is simple enough. We have a bunch of high school kids getting together for one last party after graduation. We see all types interacting with one another and getting pretty wasted in the process. Our main character is a sensitive writer type who has been lusting after the most popular girl in school for the past four years. She has recently been dumped by her jock boyfriend, so this Mr. Sensitive thinks this party is his chance to finally hook up with her! Along the way we see several side plots involving nerds, sluts, stoners, jocks, white guys trying to act black, and any other type of kid that the high schools of today produce. Overall, this film is very, very well done. I'm still surprised how much I like it.And every 15 minutes or so Jaime Pressly can be seen strutting her stuff. I swear that girl is amazing! It's too bad she doesn't have that many scenes. The last we see of her is when the cops bust that party. She's all curled up and passed out on a chair. Just waiting for that special guy (like me) to carry her out of that party and take her home! Oh well, we can dream, can't we? By the way, the guy who plays her boyfriend is the guy in the pickup truck whose buddies beat the crap out of Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights!Anyway, I like this film. The sensitive writer guy is a lot like me. I also connect a little with Seth Green's character since I was accused of acting black in high school because I was the first kid in the suburbs to listen to rap music. There's a little of each of these characters in all of us, I suppose.Do yourself a favor and watch this film if you get the chance. It's nothing profound or deep, just a bunch of kids having a wild party and learning some things about themselves and each other along the way.Oh, and have I mentioned that Jaime Pressly is in the movie?I'll give it 8 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.",Can't Hardly Wait
31,jpschapira,This one's a nice party...,7,9 February 2005,"Yeah, yeah. It is the girl, it is the boy, it is the crazy one, it is the geek, it is the popular one, it is the party. I know all those things that most of the time come along in the package of a teen movie. But this film is really one good piece. I can't say great, but I can't also say bad.Here, unlike many teen comedies, we get to meet the characters. To know details and things about them, because they aren't comic creatures. They aren't one dimensional, you know? It always happen that some characters just got to be there, and don't have much development, but some others do. And it's not easy to create much development for one night only, because there is only a party.This guy, Preston. He is totally mad for this girl, so that he thinks they are meant to be. And maybe they really are. And this girl, is so trapped in her world (no matter what that world is), that she's not looking anywhere else. And if she looks, it might be too late. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Ethan Embry are more than alright for this characters. She (Hewitt)is gorgeous, and she doesn't need a lot of effort to play Amanda's part. It's just the part of a gorgeous girl. He (Embry) is impressive. In his eyes you can see that he has been left aside, most of the time. Embry gives some kind of depth to his characters, even if he doesn't have to. I liked him in ""White Squall"" and I understand him here.The rational character is Denise. She doesn't want anything to happen but she hasn't even tried. Ambrose gives simply the best performance of the movie. And Seth Green made me laugh. His character, Kenny, wants anything to happen, but he has looked to much, and needs to stop a little bit. As for William, well, he is that neutral character, he needs some new things in his routine. His life has been the same for too long. Many things could happen in this party.All the rest of the cast is in and out, going and leaving, talking, remembering. High School is ending, it must be enjoyed, I think.Last, but not least: there's fate...",Can't Hardly Wait
32,Tito-8,Better than I was expecting,7,15 February 2000,"I don't tend to expect much from teen comedies, but this turned out to be a minor surprise.  It's nothing great, but it was generally enjoyable, and the young cast did a reasonably good job.  Lauren Ambrose and Seth Green easily gave the best two performances, and their relationship was far more interesting than the central Hewitt-Embry situation.  Had the filmmakers focused solely on Ambrose and Green, this could've been a great movie.  But as it is, it's better than most teen flicks, and worth watching the next time you want some undemanding entertainment.",Can't Hardly Wait
33,emm,Can't hardly wait to write another disappointing review.,4,7 February 1999,"I can't hardly wait to take this back to the video store and forget about it. Gather 'round your wacky friends, serve up 250 cans of Coors, and enjoy this trashy flick until you drop dead on the floor and it's all over. The life and times surrounding the Gen-X culture ignites a spark, and Jennifer Love Hewitt sparkles on occasion, yet she does fairly good, and so scarcely. This movie is beyond ridiculous, overall. Making special use of our time is the term ""movie"" that has no definition. It's a detailed in-depth examination of a night in the life of psyched-out and perverted young people at a house party doing endless rounds of dumb activity that never blesses the all-important plot. What a terrible shock to see cute, lovable Melissa Joan Hart (""Clarissa"", ""Sabrina"") wasted in something so raucous! The idea of featuring popular stars in uncredited appearances isn't working, I'm sorry to say. REALITY BITES is far better, although showing its age. CAN'T HARDLY WAIT has a couple of good qualities, but nothing really impressed me except for the final fifteen minutes. Party's over!Sony, I have you now! You're all mine!",Can't Hardly Wait
34,Movie-12,"Where's the story, the character development, the structure...* out of ****",3,5 July 1999,"""Can't Hardly Wait"" is the kind of movie that would rather talk about its characters rather than develop them. It prefers to leave out all concepts of plot and just consisting of hundreds of babbling teens. It is amazing how the movie ever got the green light to be shot.I won't tell you the story to ""Can't Hardly Wait,"" mainly because there is no apparent story. Even so, I can explain the main characters and their roles in the film. But first, the setting: It's graduation night a Hunnington High School. The seniors all plan to throw a big party. All sorts of things are supposed to happen there.1.  Jennifer Love Hewitt is Amanda Beckett. The popular, and I mean popular, talk of the school. She is described as a legend who just broke up with the much-liked jock named Mike Dexter. 2.  Peter Facinelli plays that jock, Mike Dexter, who flirts with all the good looking girls and broke up with Amanda because he thinks that the college women will be much more interesting-and attracted in him at that.3.  Ethan Embry is casted as a meek Preston Meyers who has been in love with Amanda since the second  he first saw her. He is just to shy to ask her outor even speak to her. 4.  Lauren Ambrose is the films only half interesting character named Denise Fleming, who realizes that her classmates are a mess, but the filmmakers destroy her credits too by locking her in a room with the half whited and self centered Kenny Fisher. 5.  Kenny Fisher (Seth Green) is that fool who only cares about having sex with some of the local party girls. He has a specific list of victims whom he plans of hitting on during the night.Well, take a good look at them. None really have anything to do with the other. All are moralless idiots who have no clue about anything except the present day. I don't think that I actually cared about one of them. There are also many other frantics present at the big celebration. There are prom queens, many more jocks, beer bellies, the wild ones, the mild ones who are always teased and made fun of, the spaced guys, the lustful guys, the foreign, the irritated, the irritating, side unknown, no parents or adults of any kind, and the girl whose poor house is being used for the party, which of course gets out of hand. Also there are ""special"" guest appearances of  Melissa Joan Hart as a yearbook obsessed chatterbox, Jenna Elfman as an angel stripper who offers good advice to one of our major characters, and even the heartthrob Breckin Meyer from ""54.""The script is nothing more than a series of mindless party favors, meaningless conversations, and teen chitter chatter. I can't judge the structure because I found none. And how about the comedic perspective of the film. Well, here's a one-liner that directors Harry Elfont & Deborah Kaplan (You mean there are two directors? My my my, I could have guessed that there weren't any) might want to consider next time the make a movie called this: Hey, I saw a movie the other day and during the production I was muttering to myself  ""I can't hardly wait for it to end.""",Can't Hardly Wait

37,LebowskiT1000,One of the best teen comedy/drama films to date!,10,7 October 2002,"I really enjoyed this film from start to finish, I thought everything was done very well throughout the film.  I thought the characters were done so well.  Some of them, yes, were a bit stereotypical, but even then, I'm sure everyone knows someone that does, in fact, fit the stereotypes portrayed in this film.  I really felt that I could ""connect"" with the characters, especially the star, Ethan Embry.The acting wasn't bad at all, I thought all the actors did a fantastic job with their respective roles.  Ethan Embry especially did a great job, as did Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Peter Facinelli, Charlie Korsmo, Lauren Ambrose, and Seth Green were also excellent in the film.  Also, there were a number of other actors in the film that went on to do great things, including Erik Palladino, Sean Patrick Thomas, Donald Faison, Chris Owen, Clea DuVall, Selma Blair, among others.  Also, a few great cameos including Jenna Elfman, Jerry O'Connell, Melissa Joan Hart, and Breckin Meyer.The story in this film is nothing terribly mind-blowing, but it's just a ""day after high school graduation, guy likes girl, but never had the chance to express his feelings"" kind of story, but it is quite touching at times. One thing that I REALLY like about the story and the film in general is that the film didn't contain any kind of ""gross-out"" humor.  I'm getting a little sick of every teen film trying to out-do the previous one in ""gross-out"" humor.  It's getting a bit old!  This film pulls off a great story, with great comedy and great acting without trying to out-gross other films of the genre.  Kudos to the writers and directors.This film is just a fun movie, if you're looking for a good teen comedy/drama, this is the film for you.  I really enjoyed the film, and I hope you will too.

38,OriginalMovieBuff21,A great teen film,8,4 July 2005,"I have seen a lot of teen films in my life and this is probably in my top ten. Can't Hardly Wait was a really funny movie with multiple characters having a lot of screen time and funny lines. Mike Dexter, in my opinion, was the funniest character from the whole film as the cocky and bully jock played by Peter Facinelli. His role was funny as hell along with Seth Green and the nerdy kid, (I forget his name.) The movie was good and had a great soundtrack along with good performances by mostly all of the cast.

39,PIST-OFF,Better then expected.,7,29 April 1999,"I rented Can't Hardly Wait expecting to see nothing more than the standard cliched High School movie that usually stars a bunch of twenty year olds dressed in trendy clothes, listening to trendy music, and acting trendy and stereotypical. This is basically what I got but it went a little deeper then expected.  The development of Seth Green's charecter and the tough questions posed to him about his hip-hop, trendy, black wannabe life style were unexpected and very funny. Ethan Embrey's charecter delved a lot deeper into the obsessive love that can often push lonely teens to suicidal limits. The movie is very funny with a much better soundtrack than expected. The cliched ending however is saved by the uncliched end to the Ethan Embrey character's obsessive love. Jennifer Love Hewitt is the sexiest young star to come out of Hollywood since Alicia Silverstone's premier in The Crush. And one other good thing about this movie is it happens to be about the same graduating class as mine. Class of 98. Give this movie a chance you'll be surprised.",Can't Hardly Wait
40,AKS-6,Funny and entertaining,7,8 December 2001,"First of all, I don't know why I rented Can't Hardly Wait yesterday. It's been on TV about a million times and I haven't taken the time to watch it a single time...I am no fan of high school movies. Sure, I've seen many movies belonging to that genre, but they are almost always rather boring. There are exceptions of course, and Can't Hardly Wait is one of those exceptions. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I laughed out loud several times and it was entertaining from beginning to end, apart from one or two pretty boring scenes.Of course, there is nothing new to be seen in the movie. All the high school archetypes are accounted for. Prom queen? Check. Geek? Check. Jock? Check. Guy who desperately tries to lose his virginity? Check. Et cetera... But in CHW these types are more entertaining than in other high school movies. Seth Green's wannabe homeboy is by far the funniest character in the film. The Amanda-Preston storyline is, surprisingly perhaps, the least interesting and entertaining storyline, but it's not bad enough to destroy the movie.I'm surprised, but I have to say that I liked Can't Hardly Wait a lot.

Looks like this one's about the late 90s, and it's a decent example of a prime vintage.I can't really explain the nostalgic value of seeing Jerry O'Connell drop in for a cameo, seeing Selma Blair get hit on by Mike Dexter, seeing Sabrina herself Melissa Joan Hart run around like a kid with ADHD and seeing Breckin Meyer ask us if ""Anyone ordered a Love Burger?"" But it is magic. And if you look really carefully, there's Jaime Pressley and Jason Segel, present at the role call as well. When they were making this film they were looking for more than a fast hit, casting some popular young actors in a clichéd situation involving a party after the last day of High School. They made a film that encapsulated the time perfectly. Not just the fashions and attitudes, but the way movies were being made, and the way popular culture viewed the world. This movie was accurate to the time by showing its characters to be shallow, materialistic and oblivious. It didn't have anything to say about 90s teen culture, but caught what it was. While I don't give the film credit for its clichéd characterizations, I do give it credit for the way these clichés engage with each other into a coherent, though predictable whole.The main story being told involves Amanda Beckett, who has just been dumped by her jock boyfriend Mike Dexter. Nerdy classmate Preston Meyers, flanked by his nerdy friend Denise Fleming, decides that this is the night, at the end of High School Party, to confess his love for Amanda. And that's pretty much it. There are a lot of subplots and minor characters but it all happens around the main narrative.Ethan Embry, as Meyers, is pretty funny, Korsmo, as a vengeful nerd seeking revenge on Mike Dexter for a life time of cruel pranks is actually pretty good. Lauren Ambrose is decent as Denise, but her character is annoying and quite hypocritical. Most of the cast come across well in limited screen time, and some good cameos and funny scenes fort the trailer, with a theme by Smashmouth ""I can't get Enough of you Baby,"" and it was a minor hit at the time it came out.More than a decade later, Can't Hardy Wait is the ultimate nostalgia fix. It looks like a 90s movie, follows all the conventions of a 90s movie and is made like a 90s movie. Not intelligent, but still entertaining. I'll admit a personal bias, but still recommend it if you are a fan of the era.",Can't Hardly Wait
42,Ddey65,Teenagers NEED Movies Like This!!,6,23 May 2000,"""Can't Hardly Wait,"" is the kind of movie that today's kids almost lost the chance to see. Every generation of young audiences NEEDS a teen-party movie that they can call their own. The baby boomers had ""Gidget,"" and those ""Frankie & Annette"" beach blanket movies, my generation had ""National Lampoon's Animal House,"" ""Meatballs,"" and ""Porky's,"" but until this one came out, all they had were psuedo-sentimental ""American Graffiti"" wannabes, grunge movies, and slasher films, like the ""Scream"" trilogy. Others, like ""P.C.U.,"" and ""National Lampoon's Senior Trip,"" tried to fill the void, but ""Can't Hardly Wait"" succeeds where the previously mentioned films don't.True, most of the characters, and storylines are ripped from older teen films of the 1980's, such as those made by John Hughes, but if you recall, Hughes was accused of ripping-off older teen movies as well. This could say as much about the state of adolescence in this country, as it does about the quality of filmmaking,...that is, Nothing has changed since we were kids, and that may or may not be such a good thing.Besides that, the characters and their stories are given a healthy mix. William Lichter(Charlie Korsmo), and his geeky friends, are taken right out of Anthony Michael Hall & Company from ""Sixteen Candles,"" but while Hall's character was looking to prove his virility, Korsmo's wants vengeance on the top jock. Did you see how many activities that kid had under his belt? I'm surprised he wasn't listed as a member of the IMDb Contributor's Club. Jennifer Love Hewitt hasn't looked this good since she was on that all-white cover of Seventeen magazine. But my favorite character was Denise Fleming(Lauren Ambrose), a young jaded woman, who's glad to shove her high school years behind, refusing to believe all that ""best of times,"" or ""golden memories"" nonsense.  Witness her approach to the Yearbook Girl, played by the uncredited Melissa Joan Hart, as she explains why she never got her picture taken for the yearbook, and you'll understand why she was so great.And yes, this is another ""Films of the Nineties,"" for the Citadel Press(See my comments of ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective[1994]"", and ""Being John Malkovich[1999],"" for further reference).

I am not sure if the direct wants him to do that, or he personally tried to imitate Tom Cruise. In his other movie <<Telling You>>, he has a complete different voice.The most hilarious scene is when the girl who asks everyone to sign her yearbook got pushed away by this leading guy. He was not even looking at her when he pushed her to the floor. The white guy who talks like a black person also is very funny. He is short and talks like he knows how to get girl in bed with him.

44,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Hilarious Teen Comedy",10,18 September 2015,"Can't Hardly Wait is an excellent,hilarious Teen Comedy that combines great direction,a wonderful ensemble cast,a fun script and a memorable soundtrack. All of those elements make Can't Hardly Wait one of the best Teen movies of the 1990s and one of my favorites in the genre.Can't Hardly Wait tells the story about Preston(Ethan Embry),a Teen who has just graduated High School and has chosen a graduation party to confess his love to his long time crush the beautiful and popular Amanda Beckett(Jennifer Love Hewitt). Meanwhile,Kenny(Seth Green),a Hip-Hop loving misfit who wants to lose his virginity but gets stuck in the bathroom with the cynical Denise(Lauren Ambrose),a former friend. Class nerd William(Charlie Korsmo)wants revenge against his bully football jock Mike Dexter(Peter Facinelli). All of them are in for a wild hilarious night they will never forget.After the critical and Box Office success of the Teen/High School classic Clueless(1995),the teen genre was booming again in the late 1990s and in my opinion one of the best Teen films to come out during the 90s and one of my favorites of the genre was Can't Hardly Wait,a terrific and hilarious Teen Comedy that was a modest success at the Box Office and over the years has developed a Cult following that is well deserved. Can't Hardly is a movie that is just entertaining from start to finish and it's a film that wonderfully pays homage to it's inspirations and fore fathers in the Teen genre whether it's the John Hughes films,American Graffiti,Dazed And Confused and Fast Times At Ridgemont High and while it takes most of the elements from those movies Can't Hardly Wait creates it's own world and style that makes it entertaining and re-watchable after many viewings. Also,like the movies I mentioned above Can't Hardly Wait shows off tons of actors who would become bigger and more famous years later. Nearly 80% of High School movies have one or two party scenes but in Can't Hardly Wait nearly the entire movie takes place at a party where tons of wild and crazy things take place. Having the movie take place at a party makes the film feel fresh and almost like a stage play and that is one of the things that I think sets CHW from the other Teen movies during the late 90s early 2000s. Despite being set at a party the movie never runs out of steam or wears out it's welcome and there's an energy that keeps going until the very end. The Comedy and laughs in Can't Hardly Wait are funny and non-stop with a mixture of slapstick,over the top characters and moments of hilarity and insanity. I also enjoy the fact that CHW takes place in one night which I think makes some of the situations ever more funny and over the top. The screenplay by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan is fantastic giving the characters dialog that hilarious,witty and clever. I also enjoyed how Can't Hardly Wait despite being a very funny movie deals with love,fate and looking back at the past while moving into the future which is dealt with in different ways by the main characters. And speaking of the main characters they all are very much the same kind of stereotypes that you see in other High School movies(Nerd,Jock,popular girl etc..)but as the movie goes on we learn about who they are and what they want with some depth and emotion. CHW also has one of the biggest and largest ensemble casts I have seen in a Teen film with lots of fun and interesting supporting characters who make small and brief appearances but leave an impression on viewers. The ending of Can't Hardly Wait wonderful because not only do we learn about the fates of the main characters with also get laughs,romance and some surprises. A great ending.The cast is great. Jennifer Love Hewitt is excellent,beautiful and sexy as Amanda,a popular girl. Ethan Embry is terrific as Preston,a guy in love with Amanda. Charlie Korsmo is wonderful and funny as William,a nerd looking for revenge. Lauren Ambrose is fantastic as Denise,Preston's cynical best friend. Peter Facinelli is amazing as Mike,a Football jock. Seth Green is great and hilarious as Kenny,a Hip-Hop loving goof ball. Also,lookout for fun appearances and cameos from Melissa Joan Hart(Vikki,the yearbook girl),Jenna Elfman(The Angel Stripper),Jerry O'Connell(Trip McNeely),Breckin Meyer(Walter)and early roles from Jason Segel,Freddy Rodriguez,Jamie Pressly and many more. The direction by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan is fantastic,with Elfont and Kaplan bringing a simple but effective style and energy to the film with good lighting and pace. Great direction,Elfont and Kaplan.The soundtrack is a wonderful mixture of Rock and Pop songs that go with the energy and atmosphere of the film. In final word,if you love Teen Films,High School movies or Comedies,I highly suggest you see Can't Hardly Wait,an excellent and hilarious Teen Comedy that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Can't Hardly Wait
45,Hallelujah289,"Decent, has some memorable characters",6,4 June 2020,"Decent film with a good cast and some original moments of comedy and characterization that shouldn't be missed. However in other ways, fairly standard. Not much to the central romance plot, but inoffensive and Jennifer Love Hewitt plays a convincing popular girl with soul. Seth Green's sensitive, wannabe gangsta character is hilarious. I liked the prom king's character arc and semi-friendship with the drunken nerd who becomes cool for the night.Soundtrack is good, and actually the set is neat. Feels like a play.Other than that, not my favorite movie, but certainly has much charm in places and memorable performances.",Can't Hardly Wait
46,dobbin-4,"Great film, Seth Green makes a good film great.",7,7 May 2008,"The film is a good depiction on views on the future and sudden realizations before their life truly starts. The film is about the party after graduation involving nerds and jocks alike. Seth Green plays the ""Cool in his own mind"" type of guy and really makes this movie special. The main character is good as the nerd who just wants his break for once instead of being broke. As a nerd, it was good seeing what happened to the jocks. Overall, anybody anywhere will like this movie, it is funny, it is witty and the stars are just so numerous it becomes sort of a ""Which star comes next"" type of movie. I rate this film 72%.",Can't Hardly Wait
47,Jared_Andrews,"Light, Funny, Heartfelt Teen Movie",6,13 July 2020,"For as superficial and unoriginal as the ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is, I must admit that I found it be entertaining in the early moments. The conversations, music and bouncy energy of it all is funny in a frivolous way, which is enough for a movie like this one. It's all perfectly benign, intermittently charming enough to elicit a smile but not funny enough to make anyone laugh out loud. It's noisy enough to make its presence felt but not so loud that anyone is rattled. And It's considerate enough to cause an occasional slight head tilt in thought but not provocative enough to lead to any serious exploration.An average guy and his platonic female friend fill the roles of the two lead characters. I won't mention their names because I don't remember and honestly it doesn't matter anyway. The guy has obsessed over some pretty girl for years despite never uttering so much as a single word to her. Through high school he has remained convinced that they are cosmically tethered because they both ate strawberry Pop Tarts in class once (he talks about Pop Tarts as if they are some sort of immaculate French pastry, which illustrates precisely how distorted this dude's world view is).His female friend rolls her eyes at him because she rolls her eyes at everything. What's her story? Not much. She goes to high school and doesn't like it. Cool. She must be a blast to hang out with.The guy learns that the popular jock dating the girl of his dreams has recently dumped said girl so he can date college women. This is average guy's chance, he decides, so he plans to give dream girl his letter that professes his love to her. It's a silly plan, but this is a silly movie, so it is to be expected.All the characters are delusional, caring deeply about the shallowest of everyday things. Everyone feels like a token representative of one group or another, even if many of these groups are not representative of a real high school student body. The jocks are at their jockiest, the overachiever strives to conquer one more challenge, the disillusioned girl thinks this is all lame, the band thinks this could be their big break, and yada yada. Each of the kids is a caricature of some broadly defined click. Cartoonishness is not limited to the people at the party - the part itself is a caricature. Somehow the whole movie manages to be completely cliché without being in any way accurate.Amidst all the shallow events that litter the movie, there is one genuinely tender moment. After the jock decides he wants to get back with dream girl, she rejects him. Embarrassed, he calls her out in front of a crowd, exclaiming, ""Who would want you now?"" It's a brutally dehumanizing thing to say. But she stands strong and replies, ""Somebody."" The moment is sweet and would actually be moving, except the moment is undercut by the fact that this girl is beautiful and has had guys chasing her constantly from the second she became single earlier that day.Still, I must admit, I kind of liked the scene. That's how I felt about the movie overall. It's flawed in very obvious ways that are easy to make fun of (which is why I made fun of it), and yet it still has a certain level of likability. All things considered, I'm glad I watched it.",Can't Hardly Wait
48,Meredith-7,Fantastic example of a 90s teen flick,7,22 July 1999,"I really enjoyed this film.  It was so very funny in parts and it does not slow down for even a second.  I thought everyone did a really good job with the characters they portrayed.  It was so believable as a teen film, because they depicted exactly what goes on at a party full of recently graduated 18 year olds.  The funniest scenes were between Seth Green and Lauren Ambrose in the bathroom, and the sweetest between Jennifer Love Hewitt and Ethan Embry, but that goes without saying.   There are plenty of cameos from very familiar faces, most of which seem to work well.  Its like a cross between Clueless and Animal House.  A very funny film.",Can't Hardly Wait
49,Mike-DD,One of the better teen flicks,8,26 August 2000,"For a teen flick, this one's real good - good acting, plot and sub-plots, witty dialogue, some comedy-of-errors-and-mistaken-identities, and soundtrack. You get a good look at some of the high school cliques - the jocks, the queens, the geeks/nerds, the outcasts, and Preston, the ordinary-guy-who-sits-next-to-you-in-class-whom-you-know-but-don't-talk-to-much. As in, ""You know, Preston is....you know.....Preston"". A surprising cameo role for Jenna Elfman as the angel, witty as ever. Seth Green is ridiculously funny as well, and the whole movie on the whole keeps you feeling good and comfy. It rolls along, picking up on people's lives along the way, and sometimes makes you want to scream/sing/dance/make-out along with the characters.",Can't Hardly Wait
50,rob-236,Can't wait to see it again,8,11 February 2002,"Thoroughly enjoyable teen comedy about a group of totally different high school students together in one mad party. This little gem went unnoticed in the UK without a cinema release and I managed to pick it up on video for the reason, like so many other people (probably all males anyway!!) that Jennifer Love Hewitt was in it. Hewitt is not the star here though as she only fleets in and out of the story. Ethan Embry (Empire Records) plays a caring, if a little gullible, guy who has fancied the pants off the schools most popular girl (Hewitt) all though school and he sees this party as an ideal chance to tell her, hearing that she has split from her `jock' boyfriend (Peter Facinelli  Honest). That is the main storyline, although there are many others involving different characters. Seth Green (Austin Powers) is superb as the white boy who thinks he's a `gangsta from the hood' Another storyline, and probably my favourite, involves 2 geeks who desperately want to get into the party, and the different things they try to do so. Good cast, stand out - Lauren Ambrose, who I have never seen in anything previously. Jerry O'Connell (Joe's Apartment), Melissa Joan Hart (Sabrina the teenage witch) and Jenna Elfman (Dhama and Greg) all appear unbilled.",Can't Hardly Wait
51,skullhead739,This is bad.. but also really good,7,3 July 2020,"I find myself very conflicted at this film. It has a cheesy, typical 90s story. With some cringey acting, characters and moments. But I found myself really enjoying this film. Its biggest success is the charisma of the characters and the cheesy but very relatable and sweet storyline. It has very funny, sweet and relatable moments that make this a fun watch.This film perfectly depicts the 90s and hasn't aged well. But it is a very nice blast to the past with clothing, music and oh boy the amount of actors in this that weren't famous at the time but now are wildly well known is crazy. The cast is awesome in this and it's a great movie that reminds you of the joyfulness and relatability of high school.Summary:
I enjoyed every second of this film. It's a real easy to watch typical 90s high school movie but that's what makes it so great. I would definently reccomend this.",Can't Hardly Wait
52,thefan-2,Engaging highschool romantic comedy,7,7 August 1999,"A story about two young couples learning to be in love.  Since it's also a highschool graduation comedy, the love affairs are between pairs of cliches.  Still, the movie is worth a rental or two.There's the prom queen who admits to herself, almost too late, that her football hero boyfriend is a moron who gets off on mooning the cashier at Burger King and giving the freshmen wedgies; and there's the quiet young writer-to-be who has idolized her for four years and whom she's never so much as noticed.Then there's the painfully virginal boy who wants more than anything else to be cool and who vows to get himself laid at the party, but who ends up falling in love with a childhood friend, a dumpy little girl he abandoned freshman year because she was in all the ""smart"" classes and had no money.The prom queen and her writer are kept apart until the very end of the movie, while the other couple spend the entire movie locked in a bathroom together.  Nice symmetry!  Many subplots and incidental characters, and some memorable scenes descended from National Lampoon's Animal House.As often happens in Hollywood, when faced with the job of casting an actress in the role of a supposedly unattractive character, the filmmakers goof by casting someone who might be subtly, or not so subtly, more attractive than the star.  See Janine Garofalo in ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs,"" for example.  In this movie, Jennifer Love Hewitt as the prom queen doesn't seem half as desirable as Lauren Ambrose, the supposedly ""dumpy"" little bluestocking who is in reality, like Janine Garofalo, a major cupcake.  Plus, Hewitt has these little faces she makes, the visual counterparts of the way girls that age talk nowadays.  Highly annoying, but she has her fans, and we always can hope she'll outgrow it.  7 out of 10.",Can't Hardly Wait

And it works for some of the movie, I just didn't find it nearly as funny as it was trying to be.Can't Hardly Wait probably gets more credit in pop culture than it should, cause, even if it's funny, it's just not that funny.",Can't Hardly Wait

(**SPOILER**) when amanda and the boyfriend have it out in front of the entire school and he turns out looking stupid.. that was a classic slam.  but overall with some corny jokes and the nerds trying to get advantage of a particular jock for making his life horrible in high school..which most nerds dont do.. i liked the movie and the party was pretty good.

55,Minus_The_Beer,Not Just Another Teen Movie,8,3 July 2017,"In the wake of the John Hughes teen-flick boom of the '80s, the '90s was well-stocked with a plethora of coming-of-age films aimed at teenagers. Some were better (""Dazed & Confused"") than others (""Empire Records""), but regardless of where you stood on the social ladder, there was most assuredly a film tailor-made just for you. For every ""She's All That,"" there was a ""The Craft."" Perhaps no film so perfectly encapsulated the late '90s vibe better than ""Can't Hardly Wait,"" a film named after a Replacements song jam packed with music from the likes of Eve 6 and Blink-182. Arriving just one year before ""American Pie"" would close the decade with a definitive thrust, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" didn't exactly make a big splash upon release, but has proved to be one of the most re-watchable of its time and of its kind.It's the last day of high school at Huntington Hillside and the class of '98 packs into the house of one of its more unfortunate classmates for one last hoorah. A virtual melting pot of geeks, stoners, jocks, morons and miscreants, this is a party for just about everyone. Most prominent is our lead character, Preston (played by Ethan Embry, recalling a time when the actor was known as more than ""that creepy guy"" from any number of horror/thrillers), who is taking advantage of the occasion to finally tell the girl of his dreams, Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt, recalling a time when the actress was the ""it"" girl), just how much he admires her. He's been silently stalking her through the halls, writing a long-winded love letter that he plans on giving to her tonight (because that's not creepy or anything). On the other side of the party, disgruntled nerd William Lichter (Charlie Korsmo) seeks revenge against his tormentor, the insufferable jock Mike Dexter (Peter Facinelli), who -- depending on who you ask -- is either a god, a role model or an a-hole.The guest list is jam-packed with a slew of actors who were either in every other film of its era or who would go on to do bigger gigs. From Seth Green's wannabe poser, to the criminally underrated Lauren Ambrose (who turns into Green's unlikely love interest), you can't throw a cat in this film without hitting a ""Hey, I know that guy/girl!"" Jason Segal, Selma Blair, Jerry O'Connell, Breckin Meyer, Clea DuVall, Freddy Rodriguez, Donald Faison, Jaime Pressly and Jenna Elfman, playing an angelic stripper. This film is stacked with young talent. Thankfully, none of this ever feels cluttered or disjointed. Directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont duck in and out of different social circles with ease, delivering a memorable moment just about every other minute. The film is high-energy and the cast is more than up to the task of making the sum greater than its parts. Though Green and Ambrose nearly hijack the narrative with their natural chemistry, the film truly belongs to the entire cast.More than just a time capsule, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is a great example of a teen flick done just right. The audience is never insulted, though there is admittedly more than enough sentiment on hand. Unlike the aforementioned ""American Pie,"" the film never goes for gross and never cheapens its characters. These feel like real people having a real experience. Though it didn't have as big an impact as it should've, chances are, if you came of age during the late '90s and saw this film, it's an undeniable part of your DNA at this point. Insanely re-watchable, even those of us in our '30s and even '40s (!) will find it worth revisiting from time to time, unlike our actual high school experiences.",Can't Hardly Wait

Jennifer Love Hewitt is endearing but has a surprisingly small role. It is the breadth of talent that makes this movie what it is.

However, on the lips of everyone is the news that big-man-on-campus/jock-jerk stereotype ""Mike Preston"" (Peter Facinelli) has dumped long-time girlfriend/school Queen Bee (but nice girl) ""Amanda Beckett"" (Jennifer Love Hewitt at the pinnacle of her beauty) because he wants a summer of sexual freedom in preparation for college.With Amanda finally free, every guy views himself as a replacement candidate for Mike. Among them is kindly intellectual, nice guy ""Preston Meyers"" (balding Ethan Embry) who has had a crush on Amanda since freshman year and is convinced they're destined to be together. Despite the scoffing of his platonic and cynical best friend ""Denise"" (Lauren Ambrose), Preston is determined to let Amanda know his true feelings for her.Meanwhile, class nerd (Charlie Korsmo) and two dorky friends plot revenge against Mike for a school life of humiliations. Pretty-Fly-for-a-White-Guy ""Kenny Fisher"" (Seth Green) is determined to lose his virginity. And ""Yearbook Girl"" (Melissa Joan Hart) tries to get everyone's signature for her yearbook. Oh, blink and you may miss Jason Segel in his film debut as well as a host of other now famous actors in bit roles.As stated, this is not a period piece. However, as the decades have gone by the late '90's look better and better. And this movie is about as late 90's as it gets. It's become a time capsule of pre-9/11, Great Recession, obesity epidemic, Covid and iphone zombiecated America.As a film, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is mildly amusing. Although clearly inspired by them, it's not ""American Graffiti"" or ""Dazed & Confused."" Still, the story moves quickly, the actors do their jobs, and Miss Hewitt is gorgeous. The ending, though, is nerd fantasyland. Prematurely balding, Kurt Vonnegut-fan, ""nice guys"" like Preston do NOT get girls who look like Amanda because they wrote a ""nice"" letter. The ending is silly. It's as if the writers watched ""American Graffiti"" and said: ""Hey, wouldn't it have been better if the ""Blonde in T-Bird"" had shown-up at the airport to meet Curt?"" Uh, no, it wouldn't have been.",Can't Hardly Wait
60,tripwires,Can't Hardly Wait for it to End,5,13 August 2001,"I remember watching this, like, 3 years ago and thinking it was the funniest movie I've ever seen. It was showing on HBO, so out of pure boredom I watched it again. This movie is proof that it's hard to relate back to your old self when you've grown a little older. I truly wonder, with all my heart, why movies like this one were made. Like, what's the point? It's not overly funny and doesn't require even the slightest amount of thinking, except oh wait, except maybe like, halfway through? You begin to wonder why are you watching it in the first place. Is it entertaining? Only slightly. Is it funny? No. Where the hell are the jokes? Or rather, where is the plot?
Jennifer Love Hewitt proves to be one of the more overrated actresses in Hollywood. Perhaps it's just her role, but her popularity never ceases to amaze me. The lead guy, Ethan something or other, is relatively okay as Preston something or other, but like Hewitt, suffers from a flat character with no depth and no, well, character. The few comic reliefs in the film are Seth Green, Melissa Joan Hart (better here than her regular TV show, Sabrina the Teenage Witch), the guy who goes around reminding everyone of their embarrassing high school moments, and the guy who played William, especially when **slight spoiler** he got up onstage and sang/lip synched to Guns and Roses' ""Paradise City"". Seth Green had totally outdone himself, considering his character in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" didn't require a lot from him. Other than the ones I have just mentioned, I don't think  remember anyone else.Granted, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is a good movie for light entertainment, or just to cure your extreme boredom.

62,RJBose,Can't Hardly Write,7,16 October 2002,"Hollywood studio writers seem to be writing the same scripts over and over again.  Doesn't anyone there have any new or original ideas? Are they locked in some sort of time warp in which they must relive their high school years in an unending cycle? The ""high school students' wild party"" is emerging as a standard and tired cinematic genre(as in the ""haunted house"", the ""big game"" and ""tragic romance"").  ""Can't Hardly Wait"" endeavors to string together an entire movie about the eminently predictable events and people of one graduation night party, and generally succeeds in this albeit modest mission of rather limited goals.  Of course, we have all seen this before, recently in the ""American Pie"" chapters, but also through a wide selection of ""teen"" movies over the past 25 years; (""American Graffiti"" pioneered this in my own early high school years by setting the whole story within one night for high school seniors on their way to their respective futures). Within this context, however, a few notable observations can be made.This was apparently one of the first major screen roles for TV star Jennifer Love Hewitt.  As a vehicle for her, this movie fails, as she morosely sulks through the plotline.  She is supposed to be the most beautiful and sought after girl in the high school, although nothing demonstrates why she would have been considered as such by anyone.  Her boyfriend, (of course) is the school idol and football star, who (of course) is a shallow and self-centered jerk.  The story follows the attempts of one of the students who had admired JLH from afar from the first day she transferred to the school, to reveal his feelings for her (contained in a now four year old letter) before he leaves for college (Dartmouth, in a vaguely original touch).  There are various sub-plots including a dork emulating ""hip-hop"" locutions and mannerisms, the revenge planned by the class brain (to be taken on the aforementioned jock with the assistance of some fellow nerds) and the ""coming of age"" of an embittered girl, disdained by the ""in crowd"" who are shown as vacuous and petty (of course).The hip hop dork is played by ""Scott Evil"" of the Austin Powers movies, apparently heavily influenced by the ""Bud Bundy"" character of ""Married With Children"".  There is the obligatory ""foreign exchange student"" - a male this time- who is (of course) the butt of some simple minded humor.  A recurring character (uncredited for some reason) is the girl who played ""Clarissa"" and the 'teenage witch"" in those TV shows, Melissa Joan Hart (another three name leading lady) who is the ""school spirit"" advocate who is (of course) a loser.The movie is predictable, but there are some interesting diversions and false starts (or finishes) that keep the story more interesting and original than one might suspect.  (Is there any one of us who at some point has not felt that a particular song playing on the radio was somehow a message from the Fates intended for our ears alone?) One important issue significantly left unaddressed, however, is what JLH's four year relationship with the jerky jock (who is humiliated in front of all (of course) before the final credits, says about her own character's intelligence or depth.  That's really something for these movies' writers to think about.",Can't Hardly Wait

64,LJStephens1980,This does bring back memories,10,17 May 2008,"this came out in September '98, (Australia) I graduated High School in October '98, and can relate to everything that is in this film. Whilst not in the same categories as Shawshank Redemption, or Casablanca, this is still for its genre a remarkable film. The cast in one word: perfect. Jenniffer Love-Hewitt obviously didn't have to act here... her Amanda is both likable, yet god! she doesn't know that prince charming aka: Preston Myers (Ethan (Embry) has pined for her, for four years! Man! and if that weren't enough there are a load of real interesting sub-plot's in this film. Including the legendary Seth Green as a white homeboy, Kenny Fisher, who think's he black. He mainly interacts with another great actress, Lauren Ambrose, (who was also in Six-Feet Under, and a few others from this film). who's character Denise Fleming, doesn't want to be at the party at all. Without giving away, how she and Kenny (Seth Green) end up together, confronting how, and why there are no longer friends it's hilarious.Another two interesting sub-plot's are the band: Love-burger, and the actions of the class nerd: William Lichter, are so goddamn funny!For its genre, this is hard to top, other films, try but without much success.

65,Junker-2,Can Jennifer Love Hewitt act?,3,14 November 1999,"""Can't Hardly Wait"" was a perfect fit for Jennifer Love Hewitt. She doesn't have to act. All she has to do is sit on the sofa, pout and show off her cleavage. To her credit, however, she does this very well.I am seriously beginning to doubt Miss Love's true acting abilities. When is she going to be in a substantial movie with a role that requires her to do some real acting? Perhaps if she ever does have such a role her lack of any real acting talent would be exposed and her star would come crashing down. So it's safer for her to stick with lightweight movies such as ""Can't Hardly Wait.""I gave CHW three stars: Two for Seth Green, who is pretty funny all the way through, and one star for Melissa Joan Hart in an unbilled appearance. Other than that, you've seen this plot many times before and you've seen these characters many times before.Of course, CHW would have been somewhat redeemed if it had given us a positive message or two. Instead we get more cliches, like getting drunk will change you from Mr. Nerd to Mr. Popularity. Please!""Providence"" fans, look closely to see a pre-Providence Robbie Hanson guarding the beer keg. No, on second thought, leave this movie alone and watch a re-run of ""Providence"" instead. That would be much more entertaining.",Can't Hardly Wait

68,burnzyburns,Pretty bad,4,4 March 2021,"Before American Pie turned this teen movie genre around forever, we had Can't Hardly Wait from 1998.And it's pretty bad.It actually stars a ton of recognizable faces, from JLH to Jason Segul. They all went to on to do other teen movies that are much better then this one. It's ironic how they all clash in this movie and this was probably the start for most of them.But this movie is a hot mess. There is no likeable character, no real plot structure, no funny/memorable scenes, horribly cliche (even that's not done well). It actually gets worse and worse as the film goes on, and I wanted to give it a 6 or 5 out of 10 but I just couldn't help and go under the median and give it a 4.The American Pie reference is there because it came out the next year and basically buried movies like this forever. It basically turned around how teen movies should be done.Go ahead and browse the National Lampoon catalogue of terrible teen movies and you will find some of those movies are better then this one (like Dorm Daze 2. Thank me later). Well that's not a good case for Can't Hardly Wait. With its (very) few moments like the soundtrack and Ethan Embry pulling off a half-decent main character, this is not nearly enough to rise this one above to any sort of rank.Easy pass.",Can't Hardly Wait

A whole movie about her would have really bit.",Can't Hardly Wait
70,mronrox45,The last great teen movie,10,14 January 2013,"I liked this movie a lot. It had all the elements of a great teen movie without the whinny, class warfare of the 80s teen flicks. Seth Green was excellent in his role and has a lot of one liners that we still use around our house today. Its hard to really critique this movie on a normal basis because it lacks real depth. But if you want to laugh a lot and have a good time with friends, this is the movie to break out of the DVD collection. Like I said before, this is truly the last great teen movie to come out of Hollywood. I've heard that the directors cut is better but the original has enough laughs to make it watchable. Watch it....and watch it again!",Can't Hardly Wait
71,oliver-123,Not as good as some would have it,6,22 November 2006,"I have certainly seen high school movies I enjoyed more (Dazed and Confused, for example). I felt many of the performances, like that of Jennifer Love Hewitt, only came alive later in the action - JLH did not make much impact when she first appeared, but was good later on - and maybe there were too many different story lines. The most consistently good actors were Ethan Embry and Lauren Ambrose; I have to admit, I found Seth Green's character a pain in the backside, and, not being of that age or culture, had little sympathy for his relentless ""homeboy"" stuff; he was much better when he stopped! There were some nice set pieces, like the nerd suddenly lighting up the party with his (drunken) karaoke performance, and the top jock getting his richly deserved comeuppance - but why was he back with his friends the following day, as if nothing had happened? One can't feeling they would have been uneasy with him, maybe even a little contemptuous after what they had seen and heard.It was undoubtedly a bonus to see actresses such as Jaime Pressly, Selma Blair, and Melissa Joan Hart making an appearance, if only fleetingly in Selma Blair's case.Nice ending (after some credits), reminded me of the end of Gregory's Girlfriend.",Can't Hardly Wait

As I used to hate Jennifer Love, watch it would be the worst moment of my life. I let her watch it first and the next day it was my turn... It was until in the beginning of the party and I was already loving it.
Can't Hardly Wait is about one party where everything happens! Only this? I can say yes. But it's incredible how the director mixed a lot of stories into it. And as a consequence here in IMDb it's classified in three genres: comedy, drama and romance. I really loved Preston Meyers, played by Ethan Embry. Sometimes he was funny, sometimes he was sad... The scene which he talks with the Angel Stripper is very good too. Other good character is Denise Fleming, one rejected girl.  In summary, it's not a unlosable movie, but it's almost. Of course teens will like it more than older persons but it at least deserves 6. It's impossible to hate it. I'll give it 9.",Can't Hardly Wait

77,SykkBoy,"Nothing special, but not bad",6,14 June 2001,"When I first heard about this flick, I mainly only wanted to see it for Melissa Joan Hart (even knowing she had a very brief role). I'm no fan of ""giraffe neck"" Jennifer Love Hewitt and in this movie she did her typical ""I have large breasts, so don't really need acting talent"" impression...Being of the Generation X variety, I liked this movie more than my fellow Gen Xers and a few grumpy boomers...(FWIW, American Graffiti was overblown and if you weren't of that era, it was nothing special). MY egenration had ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" and the John Hughes films. This was a nice throwback to those films. Simple, humorous and fun. No overblown plots, character development, etc. just a fun time at the movies.Amongst the other positives: Seth Green, not a bad performance yet. MJH, not many scenes, but then, I'm a tad bit biased ;) The band that never gets to playa  single note (having had a high school garage band, I got a kick out of the pretentious lead singer, the guys arguing over what they were going to wear, etc.) The nerd's first beer Jenna Elffman as the stripperA nice pleasant film that sadly sounds as if some funny scenes got cut to appease the MPAA and get a PG13 rating...funny that this movie has the same rating as ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" where a man pulls another man's beating heart out of his chest (not that I'm against some good old fashioned heart ripping, just odd that these two movies carry the same rating). Maybe is Speilberg had directed this...
Overall, a decent little film 7/10",Can't Hardly Wait
78,Susie-7,Standard '80s film with less sex.,6,5 August 1999,"My only real complaint with this film is that, much like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, there is too little time for all the characters in this film.  Fast Times was based on a book, so I assume the characters got flushed out more in it.That being said, this movie was decent.  It was very reminiscent of high school in many ways; Seth Green's character in particular was a prototype for many people I went to school with.  The only thing that really is not consistent with my own experience, and it is the same with virtually all teen comedies, is the popularity thing.  I went to three different junior highs (Grades 8-10) and a senior high (11-12), and there was never a single popular group, never mind a most popular couple.  In Grade 12, for example, there were three massive groups- one was the drama group, another was the slacker group, and the last was the Indo-Canadian group (which, for anyone who doesn't know, is made up of the people whose families are originally from India or Fiji, not Aboriginal peoples).  All three groups hated each other and in the case of the first two (since the third was not really a ""popular"" group but rather the majority of Indo-Canadians in the school) really seemed to believe that they were popular.  In actual fact, those of us not in either of the groups didn't give a sh*t.  At the Grad dance, I did not even know who either the king or queen was.  There were 700 Grade 12s, and no one knew everyone.  So I am unsure whether the popularity pyramid represented in movies is an accurate picture of most people's experience or not.  My boyfriend's school had a popular crowd, but his school had only slightly more students but divided into 5 grades instead of two, making only about 300 grads, most of which a person had gone to school with for 5 years and not 2.  In this film, I believe Melissa Joan Hart says there are 500 and something grads, so everyone did not know everyone else.  Is it realistic in such cases to have two people admired by the entire school? I have no clue. About the only teen movie I can think of where there isn't this one little clique at the top is Fast Times, but that movie doesn't deal with extreme popularity or unpopularity.Still, even having gone to schools without much of a hierarchical structure, there were still enough small hierarchies to understand the popularity issues in this movie and empathise with the nerdy William or the superficially-worshipped Amanda.  I also thought that it was very realistic (and equally as realistically frustrating) that Mike Dexter realised the error of his ways only to continue acting like that; I've witnessed that story before many times.  And I certainly can appreciate this movie's demonstration of the superficiality of high school.  Thank God I got away from that and moved onto the superficiality of university.All in all, this was a decent movie, but it needed either to reduce the number of characters or to increase its length in order to truly be a really good movie.  Still, it is certainly equal to some of the better teen films of the 1980s.",Can't Hardly Wait

My favourite character is Seth Green (Kenny Fisher). I also like Melissa Joan Hart, who played an annoying yearbook girl. Jennifer Love Hewitt was ok, but Ethan Embry (Preston Meyers), Charlie Korsmo (William Lichter), Lauren Ambrose (Denise Fleming) and Peter Facinelli (Mike Dexter) did amazing jobs. It is extremely funny.Most teen flicks aren't funny, but this one was. It had a better plot than American Pie (If you call four teens trying to have sex a plot), more jokes than in She's All that, and better acting than in Detroit Rock City. There's about only one teen flick thats as good as it (Scary Movie) and one thats better than it (Road Trip). My rating: 9/10",Can't Hardly Wait
80,Phoenix-107,Best Teen Movie,8,18 June 2001,"Without a doubt the best of all movies in the oversaturated teen genre. More accurately describes high school life and kids than any other movie, and especially any TV show (i.e. Dawson's Creek,juniors in HS use doctor vocabulary). If you're a teenager and have not seen this movie, then shame on you, see it at once. If you're over the age of 20 or so, you may not enjoy it as much.

81,niteman,Will you enjoy this movie?,8,12 February 2000,"First, if you're over 30, you're right out.  You're too far out from high school to take this movie seriously.Now, there are two types of people under 30.  The first category are the teen-movie lovers --  those who laughed out loud at American Pie, boogied to 10 Things I Hate About You, and even misted up at the unlikely finale of She's All That.  It doesn't matter that some of the dialog is campy, the events don't make too much sense, the sentiments aren't profound, and sometimes the hijinks don't resemble anything that ever happened in any high school anywhere.   The movies are good fun, a nice reminder of a simpler time.For these people (myself one of them), Can't Hardly Wait is great.  It's funny, it's got Seth Green, a personal hero, and it has great intertwining plot lines held together by photogenic actors and actresses.  Bug-eyed Ethan Embry is at his best here, as is Melissa Joan Hart as a yearbook-obsessed kook and little Charlie Korsmo, all grown up, as the resident geek who finds fame lip-synching ""Paradise City.""  All of the stock characters are represented -- the jock, the nerds, the beautiful cheerleader,  the shallow ""best friends,"" the white wanna-be homeboys -- but, as in American Pie, are given enough human dimension that they're plausible and fun to watch.  The movie's entertaining from start to finish, refreshingly irony and angst-free, and the ending is cute as can be.The other type of people under 30 are those who take their movie-watching very seriously.  They don't have time for fun, silly movies, and they viciously rip them apart because they aren't perfect.  They hated American Pie because it had semen humor, they loathed 10 Things because it ""blasphemed"" Shakespeare, and they wouldn't think of buying a ticket to a movie called ""She's All That.""  That sort of person should avoid this movie like the plague.  If it's playing at a party, leave the room, you're only going to spoil it for the people born *with* a sense of humor.So, all you category-one youngsters, enjoy Can't Hardly Wait.

The movie was funny and I pretty much enjoyed every minute of it. The characters, although somewhat shallow, are interesting and distinct from one another.

85,Walls Of Jericho,"Flawed, but still good",6,30 March 2001,"I like this movie, maybe for reasons I can't explain. There are flashes of brilliance in this film that probably want me to like it, and I guess that's why I do. Nothing cracks me up more than when the two nerdy sci-fi dudes on the rooftop are talking about how one of them isn't going to get to see their internet girlfriend because she's on a photo shoot in Fiji, before he utters the classic line in total matter of fact fashion, ""But that's the price you pay for dating Christy Turlington"". It's those little things that suck me into giving this thumbs up. Seth Green, as the clueless but likeable (After he drops his guard) white rapper is another reason. Green just has a way of nailing these character so perfectly, projecting all the insecurity of a teenager.Now on to the flaws, the main one being the Jen Love Hewitt/Ethan Embry romance part, which IS the center of the film. I'm sorry, but it is hard to believe that his character would be so enthralled by her for anything other than physical reasons. We don't even have any evidence that he has ever heard her SAY ANYTHING, yet he can write letters professing love and how he sees beyond her exterior. Give high schoolers a little more credit than that, please. Sure he's a goofy kid, but he has to have SOME brains to go to Dartmouth, right? Meanwhile, she rambles on about how everyone thinks she's shallow, yet says nothing to prove the contrary. I can't believe her character is that emotionally dependant on a sophmoronic high school jock that she ""Doesn't even know who I am"". I get the feeling that if the Embry/Hewitt characters sat down over a cup of coffee, he would realize how stupid it was to obsess for four years. Do you think she even KNOWS who Kurt Vonnegett is?

89,Newguy,Trying to Rekindle The John Hughes Era,6,15 October 1999,"Can't Hardly Wait is an amusing little film about a high school  guy's four year infatuation with a girl, that uses the party after graduation for a backdrop.  The sub-plot is essentially what goes on at that party.  While not able to measure up to the John Hughes classics that define this genre, Can't Hardly Wait is a worthwhile film with a good enough story, a few neat gags and some interesting performances.  Seth Green as Kenny Fisher (a young white suburbanite who better identifies with African American culture) is great.  His timing and his tact (or lack thereof) help this film move along. Ethan Embry's portrayal of Preston is fine as well. Embry has a knack for portraying the heartfelt nice guy.  However, its Charlie Korsmo's performance as William Lichter (the class valedictorian) that steals the film.  Korsmo is perfect right down to his demeanor.  You really see the misunderstood nerd evolve into the teenager that he has desperately wanted to be (and in the course of one evening no less).  In my opinion Jennifer Love Hewitt (the object of Embry's affection) is merely eye candy.  They could have cast almost anybody in her role, and maybe should have.  Hewitt is flat and often devoid of emotion or presence.All in all, a good flick to watch on cable when you have nothing better to do.  Although no comedy today can truly capture what John Hughes did in (and for) the 80's, Can't Hardly Wait is a slightly above par comedy worth taking a peek at.SSB - New York City - October 15, 1999",Can't Hardly Wait
90,glassorange,One of the very worst of the teen movie genre.,2,15 March 2002,"Not all teen movies are bad.  Some are actually really good.  Such titles include ""American Pie"" and ""The Breakfast Club"".  The reason these films are good is because they have interesting, realistic characters and interesting, realistic (and often very funny) dialogue.  However, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" from 1998 has no interesting people whatsoever.  Maybe one or two realistic ones.  No good dialogue, though.  None.  The fact that so many IMDb users love this film is utterly mindboggling.  What's to love in this film that hasn't been done about half a billion times before?  There isn't a single original thought in the entire film.  The characters that aren't boring and mundane are the ones that are extremely stupid and endlessly annoying. Ethan Embry is a pretty good actor, as we've seen in films such as ""Empire Records"" and ""That Thing you Do"".  But he gets stuck with a dull character whose script gives him nothing interesting to say. NOTHING!  Not one thing in 100 minutes of this godawful picture (just 100?  wow, it felt like a decade).  It doesn't help that the girl he's a had a crush on for four years (CLICHE ALERT) is played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, who isn't much of an actress in the first place, and whose character isn't any help.I don't think anything could have saved this film.  There is a ridiculous cliche in almost every scene.  It's hard to imagine this film existing with out them (though it would be fun imagine this film not existing at all).

Pretty much every character in the movie is completely shallow and not believable, including Amanda and Preston, whom we're supposed to be rooting for. The only reason these two characters look good is because everybody else is so bad.

Having gone to wild parties in my high school days, I could personally relate to a lot of what went on in the movie, which made it a more entertaining experience. With only about 5 minutes left in the movie, I was feeling very satisfied and was glad I stayed up extra late to watch it.

The reason I watched it in the first place is because I've always been a huge Jennifer Love Hewitt fan, mostly for her aesthetic value. What sets this movie apart from most teen movies is the lack of anything heavy or depressing. Some directors think that sad stuff are ""catches"" the grip you and make you more interested. No, they just put a damper on the experience. The story is nice, the performances are humorous and interesting (props for Lauren Ambrose and Peter Facinelli for two memorable ones). The songs are nicely chosen (Paradise City, ah, the memories). And the movie's got every possible archetype you could think of: the geek, the jock, the jock's buddies, the wigger, the prom princess, the wise-cracking outsider, and a plethora of others.All in all, this is the movie to watch if you're looking for something fun, lighthearted and upbeat.

Except I gave the girl the note and told her not to read it until tomorrow, and instead I told her everything on it three days later, so she's not as clueless as Hewitt's character was...Anyway, the movie.  It meant a lot to me, but was also really funny and really great.  The stereotypes couldn't have been more stereotypical, and the ending couldn't have been more predictable, but that's what made it great.  We knew what we wanted to happen, and eventually, in a mixed up sorta way, it did.  That's only half of what made it great, though.  There was a surprise even with the predictability: Seth Green's character. Lauren Ambrose's character did a great job of bringing it out, while her's, although well developed, had loads more to offer.  Hewitt had a smaller role than expected (as said in an earlier comment) .  I actually found a great deal of symbolism, like an angel showing Preston the way...  Unexpected for a teen hormone flick.  (I was at a party last night, and we were talking about G-d and philosophy on the Holocaust, not about what college girls would be like).  I know exactly where the nerd was coming from, making all the devious plots and whatnot.  I'm glad I grew outta that part of my life...  The other two guys talking on the roof was REALLY funny, and even the ""we're G-d's salt..."" bit was great.  And the ""I don't wanna be Grand Moff Tarkin!""  Heh heh.  The part where Preston was thinking that it wasn't meant to be was the exact way I had dealt with things like that, it was a real eye opener that people think a lot like me sometimes.  I just didn't have the ending that Preston did, but then again, I'm not on my way to Boston so there is still hope...I hope you enjoyed my ramblings.  Whether you liked them or not, SEE THIS MOVIE!

I found myself hoping to see more of the scenes with Seth Green and less with everyone else- but I also apprieciated the way this film doesn't just revolve around one character. There are so many lives going on in this film that you feel as though you know someone like each and everyone of them.. I certainly know a lot of guys that are EXACTLY like Kenny Fisher... At times it's confusing and drifts from the actual ""plot"" (if there is one) a few times, but it's not supposed to be taken seriously- I hate it when people analyze films... All I know was I enjoyed it at the theatre and I enjoyed it even more the second time I saw it... and I know one more present I want Santa to bring me...  Can't Hardly Wait with a little green Bow on it please:)  B+",Can't Hardly Wait
98,cjlove2523,I need to write a 2 part review. This is part one,2,28 August 2019,"Yes, there are a lot of '90's stars in this ""movie"" about a love struck boy, Preston, who has pined pathetically away for the most popular girl in school, Amanda, for 4 years, because he thought they shared a special and deep connection. Look, I am probably going to sort of write in this review everything that happens because as much as I hate reviews where the only thing the reviewer say is literally what happens throughout the whole movie, after my little intro, I'm just going to dig right in and tell you my thoughts and opinions on the movie while telling you what's happening but not being able to tell you WHY.So back to Preston and what he thinks is this unspoken God's Will for him and Amanda to be together. He happens to be the very first person to see her out of all the students at their school when we exiting her car on her first day when she was sort of new and since he was late. Let's just say this love for her doesn't stem from any sort of conversation on literature, poetry, movies, art, or music. I mean... there isn't even ANY conversation AT ALL. When she first sits down next to him, (you don't see her at all so we get the BIG reveal, more on that later) he knew he was in love and it turns out it was because... they both liked the same strawberry pop tart! He even says in the movie ""What are the odds?!"" They eat the SAME pastry! So he believes *that* was their destiny, fate, and they were true soulmates. He never gave up on the dream that she belonged with him, just because of a nasty, high-sugar, low-protein junk food pop tart that's terrible to start off your day. The teacher asks the class ""Who would like to show Amanda around the school?"" (Uhh shouldn't this have already been done when her parents brought her to that new school to sign in? To bring the transcripts in, show her where her locker is, introduce her to the teachers? Did they just throw kids into new schools without even knowing where the toilets are etc?) Preston was a half a second too late as Mike, the popular football jock raised his hand faster and Amanda walked off with him... into a steamy hallway that looked like there was a fire somewhere close by. That was that, she ended up going out with the typical varsity jock football player who showed her around for the remainder of high school. But with just his luck, everyone is talking about this huge graduation party being thrown and everyone is going to be there! Preston even convinced his best friend, Denise to join him as she is kind of an outcast. (Although, she is actually my favorite character and seems to be the only normalish one in this movie) Then Preston right before they throw their graduation caps up in the air, he finds out that Mike broke up with Amanda... and he's THRILLED! They're both going to be at the same party that night! He's so excited that he shows Denise the note he wrote Amanda 4 years ago about how they belonged together because he can see the ""real her"" He can see she may one day have diabetes or high blood pressure if she keeps eating those strawberry pop tarts. I mean it has to be in that letter right? Because supposedly it says that to him, she is not just some beautiful, popular, cheerleader with a LOT of hair! (I mean come on! The hair department worked overtime on that mop top of Jennifer Love Hewitt) She's more than just Mike's girlfriend. Even though she's undecided in life and seems to have zero direction on her future, nor does she even know his name and they've never spoken one word to each other, they're soulmates!Let's take you to the party. The party where the girl hosting it is soooo uptight about nothing being destroyed, nothing getting dirty, or messy, or nothing getting ruined or broken. So why in the world did you have a graduation party and invite a bunch of people, including a BAND and NOT expect it to get a little rowdy? Everyone starts showing up. Mike is there with his friends, who have all previously promised Mike before the party that they too will break up with their girlfriends! Until the party. Oh but they still will break up with them, but not until after the Pearl Jam concert... in August. Mike is like whatever! Buuuurp. Preston is trying to find Amanda staking our every room and Denise is wondering why the heck she's even there. However, later on she gets the ONLY and I mean literally the ONLY mildly funny scene when she gets trapped with Seth Green's character, Kenny. A dorky white guy who tries really hard to be black. I'm not talking like Mac Miller or Fez from Euphoria. I am talking about the worst caricature of a white boy being black. It was dumb. Especially since it's all a show. Ends up he's a virgin and they end up having sex on the bathroom floor where they're locked in together. They go back and forth on hating each other to kissing to hating to having sex. It was mildly entertaining.Ohhh, finally the moment we've all been waiting for is here. In walks Amanda. In super slow motion, with the wind machine blowing in her hair, a song playing, everyone stops and stares at her, and she just... stands there. Alone. Literally. For like 15 seconds looking at everyone staring at her. Ok so nowadays I grew into JLH. But my GOD I wanted to scream at Amanda at least a dozen times during this movie! This is clearly a girl who does not want to be at this party. She has awkward encounters after awkward encounters, yet she still stays at this party because of.. story. The whole time she looks extremely bored as if she was forced to stay there being absolutely- out of her mind miserable. Everyone knows Mike broke up with her. Even her cousin. And so in this side room Amanda and her cousin are talking and he's trying to tell her how sorry he is for what a jerk Mike was to break up with her. And he's there for her if she ever needs anything. Then out of nowhere, he full on sexually harasses her. He just jumps on top of her while she's clearly pushing him away and making ""help me"" noises, and guess who finally finds her? Yup. Preston. He sees them on the couch and looks gutted. He is so sad that he is seeing the love of his life, his one and only soulmate trying to get her cousin off of her while he clearly has her pinned down against her will, but he solemnly walks away looking distraught. I mean.. did I accidentally turn on Three's Company?! You can tell she did not want him on top of her! She finally pushes her cousin off of her and says he's sick and leaves the room. But not the party because...story! But Preston leaves the party. And as he leaves the party, he throws away the love letter he wrote her. The documentation of his undying, never ending, intimate, devotion that he's carried around within his brooding heart for 4 years. He throws it in the trash and leaves. Some girl gets gum stuck to her shoe and she steps on the letter and that letter looked like it had more fun at that party than anyone else. The letter conveniently gets thrown around until it lands in a bowl (more on that later) So Oreston is out there trying to call a radio show because he heard Mandy by Barry Manilow on the radio or something?? Jenna Elfman, an angel stripper, tells him to go get the love of his life! And don't let anyone get in the way of his desire for Barry Manilow! Preston goes back to the party just in time to see drunk Mike telling Amanda that he will take her back. Oh by the way, she found the letter that conveniently found it's way dead smack in a bowl right in front of her face! (Fate!) She reads it for about a second and does her whisper smile and gets up and starts asking people who Preston Meyers is. And people are saying ""He sat next to you in all your classes"" yet she still doesn't know him. Again, never spoke to him, doesn't know him, doesn't know what he looks like. Back to the Mike/Amanda showdown. She tells him to screw off, they're over. She's holding the life changing letter as she tells him somebody else wants her. (She just doesn't know who they are) He's embarrassed and there's another whole side story where this nerd was going to get revenge on him for bullying him his entire high school life. But because Mike is embarrassed that Amanda upset him in front of people for like 2 minutes (the thing Mike has done to the nerd for years and years and years and years) they become best buds. Then after the showdown where Amanda ""wins!"" everyone is coming up to her congratulating her for being such a STRONG woman for not taking Mike back, so they all want her to take her clothes off. I'm serious. All these guys are just blatantly saying things like ""K just saw what happened, God you're hot, let's go to my van!"" and ""Remember when we danced together at junior prom? I had the biggest hard on!"" ""Damn Amanda your boobs are huge! Can I touch them?"" This is all while she's walking out the door leaving. Now, Preston has ONE last chance to prove his stalking, obsessive love for her comes to fruition. So he yells, ""AMANDA? AMANDA! I LOVE YOU!"" She turns around and looks up at him, and he is stunned. He holds his chest and starts chasing her down and fumbling his way down the stairs through people to get to her, trying to tell her that ever since Freshman year he's felt they've had this connection (pop tart!) and he thinks they belong together, so if they can just go somewhere and talk-"" No. Nope. That was it. That was the boiling point. She finally unleashes her rage that she had been single for like 5 seconds and already he thinks she's going to go somewhere and take off her clothes and just ""do him"" because of some sick fantasy he's had of her (she's right) BUT instead of stopping her and handling it like a normal person would, he blankly stares at her while she's telling him off.. like his mom just told him his dad just passed away. She walks away from him and he still says nothing. But not before one final turn around from Amanda telling him to ""go get a God d*mned life A-hole!"" And everyone starts laughing and cheering",Can't Hardly Wait
99,cjlove2523,Last half of movie Part 2,2,31 August 2019,"Ok so everyone is laughing and cheering after Amanda tells off Preston and he says... nothing. He does nothing. But wait.. somehow she's still at the party? But Preston leaves. Then the annoying, obnoxiously irritating girl who has been bugging everyone all night for their yearbook signatures asks Amanda for hers and after everything she just went through for the past 15 minutes, she just smiles and says sure! As she's about to sign her name, but a lightbulb went off and she looks up Preston Meyers and realizes that the guy she just told off was the same guy who wrote her this unbelievably life changing letter! HE'S the one who wants to be with her! He's the one who wrote thee letter, the one who said she's not jus a pretty prom queen. That she's more than just Mike's girlfriend. (Even though she's undecided about life, herself, and every other thing in the world) She realizes she messed up with Preston and the letter that says she's not beautiful and runs off to find him. After some non-humorous things that happen, it's the next day. Finally. We find out the consequences of people's futures via text onscreen. I'll spare the cliched endings except of course, our Romeo and Juliet Preston's packed and all ready to board a train to go to Dartmouth... the DAY after high school graduation. So he's at the train station and the announcer says his train is about to board when suddenly a girl with a whispery voice questions him and says ""Excuse me did you drop this?"" (Yes throughout the whole movie, Jennifer Love Hewitt has a weird whispery voice and sighs after ever word then laugh-sighs when she thinks what she just said was funny. Although it never was) Preston turns and sees... AMANDA! He looks down and sees she's holding his unreciprocated letter but now must be reciprocal seeing as she is holding it! He says ""You have my letter?"" She says in the cringiest way possible ""I thought it was MY letter?"" Well woman why did you try to hand it back to him then? Was THAT your opening line the whole drive to the train station? She couldn't come up with anything better like ""Hey Preston look I am so sorry I called you an A-hole, you see there was this mix up and I-"" No. Nope. She tried to hand him the letter back by pretending he dropped it and when he went to retrieve it she's like no it's mine. I read it. It was amazing! You made me feel like so much more than just the prom queen. You even looked past my pure beauty and even said I wasn't just Mike's girlfriend. But above it all (person I've never talked to before) we share the same taste in Pop tarts and that to me is just.. destiny! So she looks at him as he's carrying his bags and she says ""So you're going now huh?"" Preston with all his bags in his hands says ""Yeah I have this amazing opportunity and plans for my life"" She congratulates him, but then she condescendingly says ""Ya know maybe this is for the best. Maybe I should just be single for awhile."" Wait what? WHAT?! What the heck does that even mean? She was willing to be his girlfriend due to the Pop Tart note? Mike had just broken up with her the day before and she went on and on saying she was single for JUST 5 seconds and already Preston you think I'm just going to strip naked and ""do you?"" But now that you're leaving it's best we don't become a couple?? Something I know you've dreamed about for 4 years. Well, they say their awkward goodbyes. He turns to look at her walk away and starts to leave, she turns to look at him as he is walking away, so she starts walking away. But then the Pop Tart epiphany strikes! He drops all his bags in the middle of a very busy train station and runs to her and says ""I bet there is a later train I can take."" And then IT happens. The most ridiculously awkward, weirdest and cringiest, stupid out of place and oddest onscreen movie kiss I have ever witnessed. It's... it's just so hard to watch. I actually think I winced and shuddered when they kissed the first time. Then they stop and look at each other and kiss again and I think I had to look away that time because it looks like he is literally eating her whole face, and she looks as surprised as she did when her cousin kissed her. It wasn't sweet or romantic. It was sick. I'm actually cringing right now thinking about this stinker of an ending. Oh and the subtext is that another train came 7 hours later so I assumed they either kept kissing for 7 hours or talked about his plans for him to go live his dreams, while she stays put. But their happily ever after is that Amanda wrote to Preston every single day. I swear that's what it said. It said she wrote him a letter each day he was gone. Oh and they're still together. That was the last line. ""They are still together"" This movie came out in 1998. So if you watched it then, they are still together. If you watched it in 2004, they're still together. If you watched it yesterday, they're still together. I mean couldn't they have added they eventually got married? And instead of having a huge wedding cake they handed out strawberry Pop Tarts? The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2/10 was because of Denise and Kenny. I wanted to rate it a 1 but honestly it wasn't the absolute WORST movie I've ever seen. But it is in my bottom 20, that is for sure. Between JLH's fake breathy, whispery, sighing voice, and Preston's completely unhealthy obsessive ""love"" for a woman that hasn't the faintest idea of who he is, and then without even speaking of it with some sort of resolve or resolution, they end up forcing us to watch this dreadful, awful, frightening, and downright unpleasant and unnatural face eating kiss. I am so sorry. There were so many good quality teen movies in the mid-late 90's and this tried so hard to be one of them. And it just isn't. Again, I apologize if you read this entire thing thinking I'm the biggest witch. But after seeing this, instead of looking up a therapist to go talk to about it, I had to get it out somehow and this was the only way I knew how to do it. I'm just so glad I watched this after a skiing accident, where I was forced to watch movies and read books. Because I would have never chose to watch this willingly at a theater. And even better, I didn't even have to pay for it. Except with my LIFE! There's 5 hours of my life I'll never get back. Oh.. wait 2 hours. I just saw the movie was only an hour and 40 minutes. It felt longer. I thought Amanda was standing at that pose when she walked into the party for a whole minute but I guess it was just 15 seconds like I said earlier. Anyways, there's my review. I will NEVER eat a pop tart again and I actually hope I never even SEE one again for the rest of my life. And my final complaint that I touched on earlier. I really want to know WHAT they ended up doing with Jennifer Love Hewitt's 3 wigs and 83 hair extensions that they put on her head? I actually really hope they made a carpet for someone who needed one. Because that was just ridiculous. Just like that kiss. And just like this movie",Can't Hardly Wait
100,adilrye_1467,So clichéd...so average....but I cant stop watching,7,18 August 2007,"Can't Hardly Wait is the definition of a cookie cutter high school flick. In honour of High School Musical and Superbad debuting side by side, this is playing on Much Music over and over again. This movie is the generic high school movie homage that seems to be a bunch of classics put together. Part Revenge of the Nerds, part Fast Times, part Dazed and Confused...part everything. This movie thrives off nostalgia of the teen flick genre. That's why I can bear with it. It's a homage to a fun genre, and while it's nothing exceptional, sometimes you feel as if it has the potential to be something more. It's a decent movie to pick you up when you're bored...and as I type, I'm watching it. The cast isn't bad, and the movie does have its charm, but it's definitely not perfect and somewhat of a guilty pleasure.",Can't Hardly Wait

102,johnston.scot,Not Only For Teens,7,24 July 2001,"Not bad. Actually pretty good.While it's a ""teenager"" movie, I don't really think you need to be a teenager, or even particularly young, to appreciate it. (Teenagers who think so should consider that, with the exception of preteens, everyone *was* a teenager at some point in his or her life). The essential nature of the characters and situations are more-or-less historically universal.The characters had just the right mix of quirkiness and believability for this type of movie. Seth Green, in particular, created a character who hilariously blended the universal (the guy who desperately wants to be *something* instead of the nonentity he fears he really is) with quirky specifics (his own brazen suburban take on ""gangsta"" culture). Ethan Embry was a moony drip, but a likeable one. Mary Love Hewitt was sort of blandly attractive, which is what the part called for. A good ensemble of smaller characters and cameos complete the picture (I particularly liked the ""remember when you threw up on the bus"" (etc.) guy).",Can't Hardly Wait

It's not even pulling very good video rentals.  It now seems to me that one of the only thing that keeps any one (especially guys) going to Jennifer Love Hewitt movies is the possibility that she may have a nude scene in a R rated horror feature. Alas, she probably will never opt to do this, thinking she actually has talent as an actress. A good actress needs to evoke emotion in the viewer. While she is nice to look at, about the only emotion she's ever evoked in me is disgust at how dumb her character is in whatever movie she's in. I foresee either a career nosedive or a continued future on TV. I can't decide which is worse. As for the movie itself, I couldn't watch most of it because all I kept seeing was a board meeting of producers trying to figure out how to sell to a teenage audience. Apparently blatant stereotypes and annoying characters no longer pull in the kids like they used to.

In Estonia we don`t make changes to the movies and there are no restrictions only suggestions for how old the movie(s) is/are made. I personaly hate those cut versions ( Perfect exampel of how the movie could have been even better is T2-judgement day (the deleted scenes hold so much information )).Well sometimes there is those directors cut`s  but then there are very big changes (ex. LEON aka. The Professional).Those are OK. But these movie makers who come out with the movie and 6 months later there is like uncut version with scenes witch were cut out with no reason is in my opinion CHEATING(not in this movies case- because there is no uncut version jet[Should be]).

111,RickDVD,"The worst, but funniest DVD I ever bought.",1,2 May 1999,"OK. You've seen the movie. You either like it or hate it. Personally, I thought this movie should have had an R rating, and so do the directors in their commentary. The movie, complete with every flaw imaginable is commented on by the directors and Seth Green. They literally laugh at the scenes which were cut, explaining why they were cut.BUT, this is a high school party movie.The only flaw about this movie is that it didn't have an ""R"" rated cut on one side of the DVD and a theatrical release on the other side. The theatrical release steals scenes from many different parties from other movies, and the directors acknowledge some of their ""steals."" I would REALLY like to see this movie in an ""R"" version, so I could get to enjoy it at it's fullest.Try to find a movie which has people who are actually closer to the age they're portraying. Believe me, it's not easy! There were too many people over 21 in the movie in real life to believe they were high-school students. Selma Blair, 26 or 27... Gimme a break!!! I could go on about this one, since Ethan Embry was the Bass Player in ""That Thing You Do"" and that was made a few years earlier. However, Embry gives the best performance, and I liked Lauren Ambrose, too. Jennifer Love Hewitt's performance was not that good, but they explain the movie was shot at night during Party of 5 shooting. Hence, Jennifer could have been a bit tired. Also, her name on the movie probably put more fannies in the seats. Sure there are a lot of cameos, but most of the people in the movie probably thought it was going to be an ""R"", instead of a PG.Cut like it is, it's a poor excuse for a party movie. Maybe a date movie, but certainly not reality. I can't give it more than 1½ stars out of 5, and that's being generous. There are a lot better movies geared to teenagers ""then and now."" Try Fast Times, Say Anything, Breakfast Club or even PCU - a college movie but Jeremy Piven is 32 and really starting to show his age (balding).Now, had this been a college party instead of a high school party, things would have worked and the plethora of deleted scenes would have been added and you would have seen people actually drinking and smoking and having a good time. Not a scene with cupcakes as breasts! This is one movie I'd leave off the resume, if I was affiliated wit the film. It's not realistic enough.

This movie was thoroughly entertaining to me. The actors/actresses played their characters as if they were actually them. I believe that this is Ethan Embry's best performance yet. He made Preston really come alive.The relationship between Kenny and Denise was quite an interesting and humorous situation. Although some people find them more intriguing than Preston and Amanda, I disagree. Preston was most definitely the star of this movie. Okay, maybe I'm a little biased, but Ethan Embry is very talented. :-)It's hard for me to express just how much this movie impressed me.

113,tjchi,Good for what it's intended to be,7,6 March 2001,"Can't Hardly Wait is the most recent of a whole subgenre of coming-of-age teen movies (Fast Times at Ridgemont High comes to mind), but it resonates the most with me, probably because it was written with my age group in mind. These movies are supposedly for teens, but they're really for the twentysomethings reminiscing about what high school was like ""back in the day"". The soundtrack is perfect for its intended audience: I'm not sure if high school kids were listening to Young MC, Rob Base, and Guns N' Roses in the mid-90s, but that's what was being played at every house party in college at the time. All the stereotypes are loud and dead-on: the nerd who gets drunk for the first time (that would've been me), the all-black-wearing ""antisocial"" girl, the ""high school was their peak"" jocks, the white rapper wannabe, etc. (Did anyone else notice the name of Jerry O'Connell's frat?) Hey, you can say stereotypes are a lazy way to develop characters, I say the plot isn't the main point in this type of movie anyway.The only thing that seems a little off is that Jennifer Love Hewitt, the not-so-shallow prom queen, seems like the only person who's ready for college; everyone else is trumpeting their high school identities one last time (even Ethan Embry, who's still not over his infatuation with the hot girl in freshman English).

117,Tubular,A Perfect film for the right audience.,9,1 October 1998,"I've heard a lot of complaints about this movie, but it seems they all come from middle-aged adults or younger teens. The truth is, this film was designed for the class of '98, and that is who it appeals to. The movie was very Hollywood, that can't be denied. Although the soundtrack may not be very original or the directing very innovative, it seems to me there is definitely a kernel of genius underneath. The plot and moral seem to me to be very meaningful and deep, but after the gloss-over by the PR department and the consultants it's possible to watch the movie as a very funny comedy. Although all of the characters are straight-from-the-box stereotypes, I don't think any other movie portrays them so colorfully or so life-like. Every character in this movie reminds me of someone I know and it seems like the dialog is recorded straight from the halls of my highschool. The main moral of the movie, that fate does exist and love is more important than anything else, may be a factor in many movies, but in no other movie is it made clear just how important it is. This is not strictly a chick's flick, anyone can enjoy this movie. This movie is perfect for any high school senior or college freshman interested in a pop-romantic comedy.",Can't Hardly Wait
118,crewgrrl,A positive review,7,31 January 1999,"I enjoyed this movie a lot.  The characters were fairly one dimensional but I still recognized them as myself and my high school peers.  I related to a lot of the situations the movie presented.  I too have been in love with someone since middle school but never been able to tell them.  I liked how everything works out the way it should.  Though real life doesn't work that way, it is nice that things can at least work in a movie.  It reminded me of 16 Candles and left a good taste in my mouth.  I can't hardly wait for my own graduation parties.",Can't Hardly Wait
119,cdr-2,Ranks high in its genre,7,22 January 2000,"What a sweet movie this is! Predictable all the way, but saved by it's extremely likeable cast: Ethan Embry, as the daydreamer nice guy, Seth Green, showing off is talent in his part as a wigger and the photogenic Jennifer Love Hewitt, who has the part of ""perfect girl"" down to perfection. (Is there any other way to describe it? She really is that good at it.)Like most good films in its genre Can't Hardly Wait has many witty moments, pace and charm. The parallels with Fast Times At Ridgemont High are obvious.Seth Green as a white boy who really would rather have been a black boy is a very funny and to the point social comment. It's a shame, however, that the film can't break loose from the stereotypes that resurface in every teen comedy. There's the blonde bimbos who just look pretty and are armpieces to the jocks. There's the jocks who drink beer and pick on the nerds. There's the nerds who have big glasses and re-enact scenes from Star Wars and the likes. Why don't producers seem able to break away from those stereotypes? The moments where these characters are brought into play, the boring slapstick they engage in... Those are the moments where the film loses it's pace and that's why these films only brush upon interesting subject matter. This is also the reason why new generations won't be bored to watch until the end of this film in twenty years time. I know I changed the channel 30 minutes into Fast Times...Without the everlasting stereotypes and standard storylines (nice boy wants girl... nerd gets cheerleader for one night or forever more) this kind of film might actually distinguish itself. As long as that doesn't change the rating of this film is likely to remain stuck at 6.3, at which it is stuck right now. That's where the genre deserves to be as it is. I rate this film slightly higher at 7.",Can't Hardly Wait

However, after viewing this movie the other night on cable (I had no intentions of renting it!), I am here to formerly apologize to Writers/Directors!I was pleasantly surprised to find this film absolutely hilarious!  For me, it was a real throwback to the teen movies of the 80's that I grew up with. Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink (notice the John Hughes theme here?) and a slew of other films that made you feel a little less alone.The writing and acting, combined with the wonderfully diverse soundtrack, makes this a movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good couple of hours of laugh out loud fun.",Can't Hardly Wait

The fact that it came out just as I graduated high school probably helped, but certainly wasn't the whole reason. I don't even know how to express what I want to say about this movie.  For one thing, I loved the archetypical characters.  You have the jock, the princess, the artboy, the homey, and the sarcastic, bitter girl.  Which is pretty much what highschool works out to anyway. The scenes between Kenny (Seth Green) and Denise (Lauren Ambrose) were wonderful.  The hatred between them was delicious, and as they started to talk, it just got better. I loved the relationship between Preston (Ethan Embry) and Denise.  They were completely the almost platonic best friends, the relationship that everyone wants.  Loved them I'm not sure about the ending, but I won't give it away.  Suffice it to say that if you're a fan of high school romance movies, you'll love this one.",Can't Hardly Wait

The acting isn't good, and the story isn't particularly innovative or even all that interesting. But when you put everything together this movie is actually quite entertaining.I think it is sheerly for the fact that we can all identify with so many of the characters in the film. At least all of us who have been through or are in high school. Each of the characters represents someone we know, or at least a conglomeration of stereotypes and people who we may know, or know of.

133,hddixon3,Vastly underrated teen movie,9,14 January 2006,"Intelligent script that has held the test of time - eight years after this movie was released, it's still hilarious. It contains a lot of classic, stereotypical characters - the nerd who plans revenge; the cruel jock; the thoughtful, poetic protagonist; and the elusive beauty (every high school had one).There are also some excellent bit players, like the complete poseur and the annoying person who can't quite seem to leave high school behind (a small, unforgettable role played by Melissa Joan Hart). It would be too easy to have these characters come off as hackneyed, 80's teens who are only interested in sex and getting high. Thankfully, they are much more multi-dimensional than that, and the actors portraying them really show this.The script was also good, containing excellent dialogue and witty one-liners. The reason I did not give this movie a full ten is that in comparing it to the true classics of teen films - Ferris Bueller's Day Off and the like - it still comes up short. Notice that I said the characters were very likable and deep. However, they're not unique enough to warrant instant recognition, like a Ferris Bueller.Try this movie out for an intelligent, late 90's take on high school.",Can't Hardly Wait

Can't Hardly Wait is your typical high school movie, filled with typical high school moments- nothing too memorable, inventive or creative here. For movies it gets a 4, for comedies it might rate a 4.5 but as modern ""appeal to the raging hormone teenage girl"" movies goes it's better than the rest, maybe a 7.More enjoyable than Animal House? Put the crack pipe DOWN bro....When you want to compare something like Can't hardly Wait you should use other more ""high school"" themed films like 10 Things I Hate About You or She's All That (both just as good, just as pap as Can't hardly Wait- perhaps they're all done by the same 100,000 monkeys working at 100,000 terminals at UCLA) but you shouldn't ruin your movie credibility forever by using Animal House and this seat wetter in the same sentence, much less the same movie review.",Can't Hardly Wait

When I was done with this movie, I wondered if ""Fast Times"" was really a horrifically bad film as well, glorified in the memory of a teenager at the time of it's release.Well, I watched ""Fast Times"" shortly after seeing this.  While I must admit that the antics of Jeff Spicoli have lost some of their humor over the years, it is still TEN TIMES more worthwhile of a film than ""Can't Hardly Wait"".A Jennifer Love Hewitt nude scene couldn't have saved this movie.

The exposition where the characters were introduced was done with eloquence--we get to know all the characters in the first 9 minutes of the film.  The movie feels like a party, man.

145,cedsouza,A timeless effort in analyzing stereotypical characters in High School with humorous acting.,10,21 July 2003,"Can't Hardly Wait...There is so much I can say about this movie. It happens to be one of my favorite movies and my all time favorite teen flick. This movie surpasses all other recently released teen movies because of the hilarious plot line that managed to capture different groups from high school to a tee. With cute Preston Meyers as a bashful hopeless romantic, the audience is forced to follow this fellow through his teenage years of pining after Amanda Beckett. Then in comes Kenny Fisher. I could go on forever about the hilarious antics that Kenny pulled in this movie and how well he pulled the audience into his world of rap music, gangster talking, white boy thinking he is black attitude. Denise is another actress that captures our attention so willfully as we constantly listen to her monotone voice bantering on about why growing up sucks and life is just really messed up. The flirting between Denise and Kenny is so hilarious that you can't help but laugh at this unfortunate disasterous couple. Next is William. William is the dork of the school who was always the butt of everyone's jokes. But he managed to play the role well as the dork that finally cuts loose and lets the good times roll. While Mike Dexter might be the worst portrayal of the jock thinking he is too cool for high school, his character makes him the enemy, which is what the audience is supposed to think of him. The movie itself has amazing shots, and I love it whenever they start following one action from room to room and then pulling something from that and following another action. For example, the letter that is traced from the trash outside to being swept inside by hockey player, to being rolled over to another room by way of keg only to finally make it to Amanda Beckett in the pretzel bowl. All in all, this movie captures all the stereotypical roles of high school teenagers bringing this movie to epic heights with its comedy and its acting.

I know where I'll be on March 9th (Australian video release date)- at the video shop purchasing this, my favourite movie of all time (that would be almost 15 years).When I went to see this movie I was on the verge of a breakdown because I so desperately wanted to see it, and complications (7 year old brother) had gotten in the way. By the time I walked out of the cinema, I was restored back to complete sanity. It was absolutely hilarious and my friends and I almost fell off our chairs from laughing so hard.In my opinion, the funniest storyline was Seth Green and Lauren Ambrose locked in the upstairs bathroom. I think that they gave the funniest performances of the entire cast. Ethan Embry was good too, and when Charlie Korsmo got up and started singing ""Paradise City"", while completely smashed, we laughed and laughed.This movie wasn't meant to provide a deep insight into today's youth.

Only after you leave the wonderful world of 9-12th grades and have some college under your belt can you fully appreciate all the subtleties here.  The creators wonderfully place all the stereotypical high school personalities throughout the movie, from the girl who has way too much spirit to the geeks who are at odds with the jocks. And I think that the creators behind this movie have done an excellent job of inserting songs that coincide with the feelings of each scene.  I don't know if I've ever seen a movie with better fitting songs to the heart and meaning of a scene.  The music makes you feel right along with the characters.  The casting is nearly perfect, with Jennifer Love Hewitt playing the ""hottest girl in school,"" and Ethan Embry gives a masterful performance as the intellectual and introspective Preston.

This movie is honestly jam-packed with some outstanding performances. Ethan Embry, Jennifer Love Hewitt,Seth Green, Charlie Corsmos, and just about everyone else shine like the stars they are.

162,Claire-14,cute film!!!,10,20 December 1998,Maybe this film won't hit the box-office but I have to admit it...it's a great one and really entertains!!!Some of you thought that this movie is a big joke and a very unrealistic one...indeed it is.But come on!!You're too serious!!!It's supposed to be hilarious!!I brought my friends along and they loved it so much.Anyone can be entertained by this enjoyable movie...unless you're a prude.You can watch Can't Hardly Wait for a million times and you won't feel bored at all!!!This is a highly recommended film for all ages.,Can't Hardly Wait
163,mikie737,The absolute best teen movie to come out in years.,9,11 January 1999,"Can't Hardly Wait gave a brand new generation of teen's something to call their own.

164,big geek,much ado about nada,3,31 March 1999,"This movie had a threadbare, guess the outcome in the first ten minutes, brain-dead plot. Betcha it did just fine at the box office.I laughed at two jokes in the movie. I laughed sarcastically at most of the others. I stared quizzically at the rest.There are no redeeming qualities to this movie. It is supposed to be about high school life. It has no resemblance to real high school life.The characters are drawn in the broadest, most stereotypical terms possible. It made me miss the Breakfast Club.",Can't Hardly Wait
165,splender,Awesome!,9,15 February 2000,"In my opinion, Cant Hardly Wait was one of the best movies i have ever seen!! With Strong performances by Ethan Embry(My FAVE Actor, plays Preston), Seth Green(Real Funny Guy, plays Kenny), and Peter Facinelli(The Jock) made this movie incredible.Now if u love all those teen-age flicks, this is a sure pic for you, but if not, i think u might find the movie to be cute and funny at points, but this one is geared towards the younger generation.But i think that it was a great movie that kept me laughing and i highly recommend it!",Can't Hardly Wait
166,bozo700,"Made me relate to so many things, it was exciting.",10,23 January 2000,"This film is one of my favorites.  It made me feel so many different emotions throughout the movie because I felt that I could relate to all the characters in one way or another. Ethan Embry is one of my favorite actors, and his quirky facial expressions, his funny dialogue, and the way he goes after Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt), make the movie worth watching.  Of course there is also Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Wow.  Seth Green puts on an amazing performance as Kenny.The main reason I liked this movie is because I felt that I could relate to every single character.  Each person brought something different, funny, and memorable to the movie, and they all took me to different points in my life where I have been THAT character (especially Ethan Embry's).Older people might not enjoy this film as younger people, but I truly enjoyed this film and enjoy showing it to other people who haven't seen it.",Can't Hardly Wait
167,emtr97r,not as good as it could've been,10,3 April 2000,"In general, Can't Hardly Wait proved to be nothing better than any other teen bopper type movie.  It gave nothing new or unique to walk away from the theatre with.  It looked as though it had more to offer but budget, rating, or other filming problems made the movie---well...SUCK!!! The only good scenes were the characters of Seth Green and Laura Ambrose.  They brought real points and situations with teen relationships and outcomes.  This movie has a few funny moments (just a few), but because of those...it's a must see for all teens.",Can't Hardly Wait
168,XanderHarris,Truly a classic!,9,29 December 2001,"I've seen this movie twice, and I must say I like it even more since I watched it again. This one is not just a great, entertaining movie with a really great cast (Seth Green being the most outstanding actor), no it is also responsible for the teen-movie revival after 1998! Because this movie was never *that* successful it is hard to compare it with John Hughes ""The Breakfast Club"", but in my opinion ""Can't Hardly Wait"" made a lot of great teen movies possible, just like ""The Breakfast Club"" did in the 80's!My rating: 9/10",Can't Hardly Wait
169,miillan,Best movie,9,6 May 2006,"This movie is a very special movie for me and one of my friends. We saw it for the first time very long ago and we did directly connect with the character Kenny Fisher. From that moment the movie is a standing internal joke between us and later on we actually bought the movie, mainly for the purpose of seeing it whenever we want to and make us happy when we're down. The movie is so funny, and it's just getting funnier and funnier each time you see it, especially for all the details you recognize after a while. For an example, early in the movie and in the beginning of the party William Lichter is making his way through the kitchen towards the beer. Right next to him a girl stands, examining a banana?! This movie is a clear choice for a fun evening with your friends. The only thing you want to cut out of the movie is all the scenes with the main character, Preston, he's so boring, therefor the 9 in grade.""Use me for my body baby""",Can't Hardly Wait
170,Buffy_buff,I need more!,10,27 October 2006,"I heard of these movie through the Seth Green page of IMDb, and when I saw it on sale at the video store near me, I had to buy it.I sat down and watched it straight away and it is fantastic. It has everything you could want in a movie - romance, humour, high-school hierarchy. It's all really good and has underlying morals...which you don't notice because you're too distracted by everything else.I love all the characters and I've put all my friends onto the movie and often we sit around just quoting it. A must-watch.The only thing that disappoints me is the cutting-out of all the drunk girl and stoned girl scenes.As a BuffyTVS freak, I am familiar with Amber Benson and immediately recognised her in the few seconds she is on screen in the cut version.I really hope they come out with a directors cut with all the deleted scenes. I wonder how we can contact them to insist on this? Any ideas people? Anyway, think about how we can make them do it and WATCH THIS MOVIE",Can't Hardly Wait
171,tinathacker,excellent high school comedy,10,27 July 2001,"I this has got to be the funniest high school comedy I've seen in ages! Firstly it has great music,secondly it has a great cast and thirdly it excellent!There's not one bad comment i can make about this film. The whole film centers around a graduation party which illustrates many different storylines that may change his/her life. There's Preston Meyers who's just heard that the school beauty Amanda has just broke up with high school jock Mike. So he plans to tell her how he feels at there graduation party with hilarous and sad results until the climatic but sweet-natured ending that made me jump up for joy! There's Preston's friend Denise who gets stuck in the bathroom with her old friend Kenny Fisher other storylines includes the class nerd plotting to ruin Mike's life. He also becomes very popular at the party!I highly recommend this movie to all teens who want a good laugh!",Can't Hardly Wait

My two favourite characters were Kenny ( Seth Green) and the bands singer ( breckin meyer ( I can't believe he is uncredited!)) Kenny Is so funny and sadly reminds me of most guys I no! I can't imagine anyone other than seth doing a better job!! Breckin makes me laugh everytime as he is never afaid to embarass himself!! other people who should not be forgotten are Ethan Embry doing a great good as leading man, Lauren Ambrose doing a good job with her sacastic humour (with is always funny!!) The whole band (funny everytime especially the hat!!) and the line 'but william you could get drunk!!' a winning movie everytime!",Can't Hardly Wait

176,lumsdon,the best teen comedy around,10,16 February 2003,"This is possibly my fav film of all time, it doesn't really have a linear story line and by the end you feel that you know all of the main character's personalities.  In the UK this film didn't do very well and not many people have heard of it so that is probably another reason why I like it so much. It is much more enjoyable that the hyped comedies such as American Pie with much more believable characters.  All in all a great teen comedy.",Can't Hardly Wait
177,someguywithanose,One of the best,10,7 June 2003,"This is one of the best movies out there. And the music in it is awesome. The best part is the part when ""Dammit"" by Blink 182 is playing (I'm trying to not spoil it) and the very beginning when that one song is playing and they're all about to graduate.

180,stebridge,A teen movie that IS worth watching,9,16 September 2004,"Typical American end-of-term party in a large house with lots of drunk teenagers trying to hook up with each other. There is a plot to this film though, where Amanda (J L Hewitt) has broken up with her boyfriend and is now single. Word spreads around school pretty quickly and EVERY guy interested turns up at the party. But there is one guy who is determined to hook up with Amanda because he feels he has a lot in common with her and that she is the one.I liked this film a lot, for a number of reasons:there is a plot/storyline that unfolds throughout the film and branches out into a serious of smaller plots, introducing new characters into new scenes or smaller plots/story lines that are carried forward during the filmunexpected turns in the film that keep the viewer entertainedthe sheer comical aspects of almost every scenethe truth behind some of the characters; the realism of characters portrayed",Can't Hardly Wait
181,andres_babe14,I loved it,10,10 February 2005,"Can't Hardly wait was like one of the best movies ever! It inspired me to become a screenwriter. My name is Priscilla, I am fourteen years old and can't hardly wait touched me. The plot, the music, and the friendship between Preston and Denise. I really loved the hooker's words of wisdom about fate! It's so true ""fate is there, but it only takes you so far because once you are there it's up to you to make it happen""-The angel hooker.If you have not seen can't hardly wait and you have ever wanted to do something so bad, but you never got the chance to just remember if fate was willing to take you that far then take that chance!

Velma from Scooby-Doo. She was cool. She was a hip, hip lady."" That last part, she was a hip, hip lady, is a total ripoff of Slater's comment in Dazed and Confused at the end of the part when commenting on Martha Washington he says that she was a ""hip, hip lady"" emphasis in both movies is exactly the same, and Dazed was first. yo Not to say that I don't like CHW, its definitely one of the best 90's teen movies.

183,trthekeeper,everything a teen movie should be,10,22 July 2005,"this movie is one of my favorites not because its an epic crime movie, or a moving memory masterpiece (i heart alliteration), or even a funky unique cult movie- its just a damn good chick flick and my favorite one of all time. this is because 1. it has my former dream girl of all time Jennifer Love Hewitt in it, and 2. the protagonist- Preston is me pretty much or at least i think of him that way. its a simple movie, as should all chick flicks be. and I'm gonna go on a chick flick tangent now. you know you like chick flicks, how can you not? if your a guy reading this then deep down you know a chick flick at some point has made you smile, or even made you shed a tear even if you refuse to admit it. there's always gonna be a place for chick flicks in the movie world, because we all want that happy ending. sure some stuff is nice during the movie but it all leads to the climax, it all leads to the happy ending. and whats not to like about a happy ending? nothing. ""cant hardly wait"" has a freaking good ending by the way. I'm not gonna spoil it for you but you'll definitely smile at the end and that means the movie has done its job. plus Seth green makes a nice appearance as the ""white guy that acts black"". this movie has it all, or at least all that it should for what it is. i dunno what it is but i love this one.",Can't Hardly Wait
184,mattgen79,Great film,9,6 June 2006,"Can't Hardly Wait 1998Shown on UK TV recently, it was the first time I saw this, (somehow I managed to miss it first time round). It encompasses so many aspects of a typical end-of-school-party, that there are bound to be a few incidents that anyone can relate to in some way. It is a 'teen movie', but not in the normal sense of the word. To begin with, there is actually a semi-decent plot, (ok, a coming of age story), although the best features are really the dialogue and performance by the actors. It feels unusually believable, yet obviously surreal, at the same time. It is sort of a heightened and idealised version of these parties, almost how you would want to remember them, even though things didn't happen quite that way in reality.There are some great scenes that put the characters in situations you want to find them in, and the ensuring comedy is great. Also all spectrum's of a year group have tried to have been accommodated, even if they are portrayed in such a pigeon-holed and categorised way. That's half the fun, and you wouldn't watch this thinking it was an intellectually heavy-weight film.It is a great deal better and not even comparable with the the American Pie trilogy or other such 'teen films' produced by studios. Increasingly, the intention is to make a non-specific film for teenage audiences, with the idea that ticking all the right boxes, with character representation, will create a success. This is not the case, as good films have an undefinable quality about them, which is natural and not contrived.There are occasions when the acting could have been a little better here, (I got the feeling that J-L-Hewitt slipped into monotone a few times), but overall the performances carry the film well.One of the things I particularly enjoyed was that it is genuinely funny without taking itself too seriously, or relying on parodying scenes from other films, in order to get a quick joke (which might be expected), eg. Not Another Teen Movie style.Admittedly, it does reference a number of films, but in a subtle manner, and collates these elements in a highly enjoyable overall film. I really enjoyed watching this film! What a great picture.",Can't Hardly Wait
185,VanPyree,Just another mediocre high-school movie,6,25 December 2016,"Just like all the others, this is a high-school movie about one last party of sorts before college. A few clichéd characters, some pre-frat-boys doing what frat boys do, geeks geeking around, some school-spirit girl trying to get folks to sign her yearbook, outsiders doing their own thing and it's mostly love stories.This was a pretty common genre back in the day and it was near peak saturation. I rewatched this film with a clean palette, but it's just not that good. It's not that bad either, but there are very few redeeming qualities about it, other than perhaps a ""before they were famous"" look-back through this yearbook of a movie. You also get to see peak Jennifer Love Hewitt at the peak of her fame.There's nothing interesting about the story that hasn't been said and done before. There's no deeper meaning to the film, no subtleties, no mysteries, no reason to see it twice, maybe not even worth watching once or paying attention while watching. There's no interesting story-telling technique, no camera tricks or cinematography. The music is just a playlist of whatever was popular back then, Third Eye Blind, White Zombie, Creed among others. It's only interesting as a snapshot of the late 90's. It captured the spirit of the 90's, the youth culture, the movie culture, the fashion and the language. Other than that, this is a 6/10 film at best.",Can't Hardly Wait
