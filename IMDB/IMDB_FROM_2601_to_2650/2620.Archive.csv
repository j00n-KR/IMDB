0,nogodnomasters,Have a safe and productive day,5,2 August 2020,"George works in a remote Japanese facility on AI. He was managed to preserve his wife's brain/memory on analog. He is working on robots to contain the memory while there are forces out confound them including his second prototype who is jealous of the third.George lacks personality while the robots steal the show. The action was not riveting. SPOILER: And if you didn't like that ""Dallas""/ ""Knot's Landing"" thing you might want to avoid this one.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity",Archive
1,kosmasp,Opening the files,8,25 September 2020,"If I would compare it to an other movie, it would be a spoiler. Then again, once you've seen it, maybe I gave you a hint with what I just wrote. Or maybe I didn't (but I probably did, didn't I?). That aside, because I don't want to spoil anything, if you are into Science Fiction movies, you may like this. It has very good visuals and while I wouldn't call myself a Theo James fan (more a Stacy Martin fan), he does a really good job.There is tension there are questions ... and there are themes that some might have resolved otherwise. But it does make sense overall. And while you could question everything in the end, you could also just take it with a grain of salt. And just accept that some things, possible in reality or not, just make sense in the overall world of the movie. So it is coherent and well thought of, but even that does not mean you will like it",Archive
2,deloudelouvain,For the sci-fi genre it wasn't bad.,7,6 December 2020,"For sci-fi fans this movie will do the job. The plot is interesting, maybe not new but there is a nice twist to it, something I didn't see coming, and that made it a bit better than I expected. Don't expect a lot of action though, it's rather slow paced with barely any other actors than Theo James, who acted really well by the way. But the story is engaging, you keep watching it as you want to know what will happen. For that writer/director Gavin Rothery did a good job, the story is never boring and that even if it lacks of action scenes, the small cast and the quite monotone environment. Archive could have been worse but in the end I think sci-fi fans will like it.",Archive
3,siderite,A stylistic mix of Ex Machina and Moon that yet provides none of the qualities in either,6,6 April 2021,"The film might have been a decent one if it weren't for the ending. I don't want to spoil anything, but basically in the end nothing happens. There is no closure, no reason for what has happened already, it just ends abruptly on a note that is part of a different song. The location is great, the style is very reminiscent of Moon (for which the director worked as a concept artist) and the play on building your own girlfriend in a remote location feels like taken from Ex Machina. But Moon was an extraordinary performance piece and an innovation at the time while Ex Machina tackled (realistically) real issues of artificial intelligence. It's not like Theo James played badly, it's that his character is bland and sometimes inconsistent in behavior and emotions.Bottom line: movies written and directed by the same guy are either amazing or they flop. This one is a flop, unfortunately. Great visuals, but no story whatsoever.",Archive

5,westsideschl,Keeping Up with the Human Brain,8,19 March 2021,"Caught me, an unexpected twisty ending. Basic science very shaky, most notably mid 1900s hobbyist electronic gear on shelves. Didn't explain how you store a person's memories, emotions, cognitive processing, etc. on a computer (even a server farm) since there is nothing out there now that comes remotely close. Besides, unlike the brain, it would take an entire power plant dedicated just to that pseudo-brain. Nice effects; interesting different take on used before plot.",Archive

Bored to freaking death!",1,5 January 2021,"This film start with a man ""George"" jogging, and he back to his working base talking to a robot scene! As turnout, this film is a series of imaginations of a dying AI company employee ""George""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and super annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the monitoring scene, overuse of the alert voice scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the long angle waterfall scene, overuse of the watching cartoon scene, overuse of the robot walking scene, and overuse of the jogging scene!

7,jimbo-53-186511,Sadly it's another dull AI film,3,8 August 2021,"George works as a robot builder in a remote location, but a tragic event in his life causes him to try to build and recreate his riskiest and potentially most dangerous creation...As Artificial Intelligence is an interesting concept in and of itself I will always try and look on these type of films with some degree of hope, but unfortunately most of the time it seems that a lot of writers and directors lack the imagination to make said concept truly work....So it seems that George is developing AI and is increasingly successful in replicating the perfect AI (although he is trying to keep this a secret from his superiors). A tragedy in George's life makes him re-evaluate his priorities, but at what cost?As I've said despite a heart-rending scenario and an interesting concept, Archive is bargain-basement quality with superficial character development and uninteresting plot twists. Theo James does his best in the lead, but can do nothing to enliven such a flaccid script. Although it does pick up moderately in the second half there is precious little to involve in this sedate, practically coma-inducing narrative..There's a silly senseless twist at the end which merely confounds and infuriates rather than adding any value to the film. One to avoid.",Archive

9,myriamlenys,average science fiction movie,5,31 May 2021,"HERE BE SPOILERS, SO READERS BEWARE...""Archive"" deals with a number of highly interesting themes, such as the possible impact of recent advances in technology on Mankind's immemorial quest for eternal life. Sadly the movie is resolutely superficial, shying away from anything resembling a philosophical discussion. It's as if the various makers of the movie were saying : ""Listen, YOU do the thinking. We've got enough to worry about, like paying the caterer and cleaning up the last of the litter before Wednesday"". Compare and contrast, for instance, to the work of a science fiction author like the late Roger Zelazny, who treated some of the same topics. His best stories and novels crackle with wit, emotion, breadth of reference and, yes, profundity.The movie ends with a giant twist. Some people will like and appreciate it ; I wasn't too fond of it, since it strayed perilously close to the dreaded ""And it had all been a dream"".From a purely visual viewpoint ""Archive"" is beautiful, with fine locations and effects.The plot deals with a scientist's desperate attempts to transfer the memories of his deceased wife into a new ""body"", with the body in question consisting of a robot. Consider how much better the movie would have become if it had turned out that something as bulky and ungainly as prototype 1 had been the ideal vessel for this exercise.",Archive
10,TdSmth5,"Powerful, if you've lost a loved one.",8,30 August 2020,"In the future, George is some scientist working all by himself in some huge remote facility in Japan during winter. His employer, some corporation, keep tabs on him occasionally via black and white video calls and puts pressure on him. He's working on AI robots. His first creation J01 is looks like some fridge with legs. J02 looks like a little astronaut robot and interacts more with him. He talks to them like he would to children and they in turn act like sisters. J03 is in the works. At first only a humanoid torso like a prototype from a Westworld lab. Later we learn that indeed, J01 has the ""brain"" faculties of a 5 year old, and J02 those of a 15 year old. And the two sure act their age.During flashbacks we learn that he had a wife, Jules, and was applying to get the funding for his project. He does get the funding and will be given the Japan facility. That's when a bizarre car accident kills the wife. But technology is such that they can keep her/her consciousness alive in some fridge for a certain time. Running that business is the Archive corporation. George does have the wife fridge at his home/lab and of course plans to implant her consciousness into J03. Archive Corp. senses that George is up to no good. Similarly his employer has some crisis manager get in touch with him who gives him a gun. Later we learn that through the Archive fridge one can actually communicate with the deceased, but George makes no use of that feature. There is some time limit to the the whole archiving business and George's wife is nearing that limit.George succeeds with J03, who now has consciousness, a full body, and skin. And for the most part they are happy together, but of course things will have to unravel and as usually happens with sci-fi movies it's during the very last minutes, just as his employer decides to shut him down.Archive combines the visuals of Half-Life with Oblivion and Westworld into a long and slow movie that focuses entirely on the George character. Unfortunately, not a lot happens. Moreover, this is the kind of movie that doesn't do much to explain itself initially. At the beginning you don't know what's going on and it's not clear the movie wants you to know. That's not a good way to start a movie. It's only once the flashbacks start that the viewer can make sense of things. For a sci-fi film it unfortunately lacks some scientific angle. There's a bit about how consciousness is stored but I would have liked to see more science. Music is typical sci-fi emotional poignant stuff. Everything depends on the twist at the end then whether the whole movie redeems itself or not. I would say, it almost does. It would have been more effective were this movie shorter and had a bit more going on. But the length and the music are designed to get you and thus make the end more touching.",Archive

12,valleyjohn,Very Clever,7,4 June 2021,"Archive is one of the cleverest, well thought out Sci-film films I've seen in a very long time .It's hard to explain why I really liked the story because it would give away the plot , which is is all about twists and turns that you don't see coming .2038: George Almore is working on a true human-equivalent AI. His latest prototype is almost ready. This sensitive phase is also the riskiest. Especially as he has a goal that must be hidden at all costs.I love the interaction between George and his three robots . No 1 is loyal but limited in what it can two .No 2 is super intelligent and can think and talk almost like a human but looks very basic and isn't very mobile .3 is the ultimate AI .The trouble is that because they have human emotions , no 2 and no 3 get incredibly jealous but does it really matter in the scheme of things ?The film is really about hanging on to a loved one once they have died and eventually having to let go..
This is one of those films that stick in the mind days after . Written and Directed by Gavin Rothery , he is someone to definitely look out for in the future.",Archive
13,Easygoer10,Umm...Woeful!,3,23 October 2020,"Like so many other robotic and/or cloning films, this is yet another engineer/scientist/inventor who experiences a loss (or losses) and must replace the person(s). Typically a spouse, that is precisely what occurs in this boring garbage. Keanu Reeves was cast in an equally bad film ""Replicas"" (2017). There are minor differences. Add in ""Wall-E"". This plot also copies ""Ghost In The Shell"" in several ways: 1st: The robotic woman. 2nd: He drives a 1980's Lotus. 3rd: There is much Japanese influence. 4th: Peter Ferdinando is both films, etc. The constants are I know who the antagonists and protagonists are before they appear in the film. There is a lot of desaturation and drone footage. The bottom line is this: People don't take the time to come up with an original script. Skip this rubbish and do your laundry instead.",Archive

15,arungeorge13,Impressive production design and an unexpected climactic twist save an otherwise predictable sci-fi drama! [+61%],6,12 October 2020,"Not quite in the league of sci-fi brilliance as Ex-Machina or Blade Runner 2049, Archive has an interesting (yet familiar) premise that features humans and artificial intelligence. George, an A.I. scientist, is trying to upload his dead wife's conscience into one of his brilliant android creations. In the process, he has created two prototypes - a bulky one with the intelligence of a toddler, and another smaller, leaner version with the brains of a teenager. Both the prototypes (treated as sisters) develop a connection with their creator. George, however, wants to build a 3rd and final prototype which has the potential to perfectly carry his wife's sensibilities and demeanor.The story gets a little dramatic in the middle portions, with one of the prototypes feeling jealous of her creator's newfound enticement with his latest, brainiest android. There's also the evil corporate angle which only drives the film faster towards its finale, but what catches you off-guard is that incredible last-minute twist. It leaves the door open for repeat viewings and multiple interpretations. Since Archive takes the predictable route to get to this cracker of a twist, it doesn't get a rating more than what's currently assigned.Theo James is ideally cast as George; to think this is a film that's primarily about a human living in an isolated lab with 3 robots, James pulls off the stoicism quite well. His relaxed self in those flashback sequences with his wife proved to be an informal breather in an otherwise sober film. The production design and special effects certainly deserve applause.",Archive
16,martimusross,Good Movie But Painfully Slow!,6,17 January 2021,"ArchiveThis was a clever and sophisticated movie but flawed in that every embryonic robotics engineer knows the holy grail of artificial intelligence is that of a perpetually self-learning machine. For the inventor to overlook this basic idea is beyond ridiculous.The rest was a cross between Kubrick and Mary Shelley and really very good. The movie posed the unanswerable question ""What is the essence of a human spirit""? The movie suggested a photocopy would suffice however we all knew this experiment was doomed to failure as essence must lay with emotion not intellect, and his revulsion as his ""monster"" developed sexuality was wholly predictable.Interesting and unexpected twist.Theo James was excellent but we never see this mans acting muscles flexed he really needs to be given something worth his talent. A casual observation he really needs to change his look as he looks too like Jamie Dornan, no photocopies!",Archive
17,vithiet,"Fantastic sci-fi movie, best I've seen since Ex Machina",8,11 July 2020,"I expect a lot of people will compare this to Ex Machina, and for good reasons. Excellent story, interesting character development, great acting and directing, this is definitely the kind of smart, evenly paced sci-fi I love (if you're expecting explosions, lasers and flying car chases, you're gonna have a bad time...).

20,Headturner1,Too bad,4,2 August 2020,I watch everything with Theo James and while this just sealed what a great actor he is it was disappointing. It's very SLOW and doesn't really explain anything. And the flash back don't really build any character development or make you care. A better similar movie he did was Zoe. The robots look like Mother disappointing and get worse. If it wasn't for Theo's incredible acting I'd of stopped 30 min in. The ending at least made the movie a 4 sadly even that doesn't save it.,Archive

It reminded me a lot of ""Silent Running"", the 70s classic. I was largely bored but wanted to see it through for the nugget of the story which is George's wife was killed in a horrible wreck so he attempts to ""robotize"" her, or so he thinks. The plot unfolds in non-linear fashion which annoys me, but the twist at the end was of some interest. This is art director cum director Gavin Rothery's first feature film, so yeh, we have ""notes"".

He creates robots but his latest invention is one infused with/ has memories of his late wife. His boss is suspicious of his intentions.The twist at the end came out of left field.

25,phenomynouss,Mildly interesting,6,7 November 2020,"I found it very hard to get invested in this movie for much of its run. I'm actually not even really sure if I was just not interested enough in it or if the movie just wasn't strong enough on characterization to keep a firm enough hold. I kept fading in and out, picking up the movie's information but not really feeling much of its overall theme or tone. It played out very plain and straightforward for the most part.Toward the end, it starts to get confusing (again I am not sure if this is just because I was emotionally detached or if the film was just too light on detail) and a lot of very important key concepts are left unfortunately vague. Flashback scenes become increasingly disconnected from the main narrative to the point where at one point I was unable to tell whether a certain scene was a flashback or not, even though it had a robot in it.
The entire ""somnulence"" thing was not given a proper explanation so I could not tell if it was some manner of suicide program or digitization or duplication, and could not understand why it was limited or what ""expiration"" meant specifically--- does it mean the customer has stopped paying and so the digital copy will be removed by the company? Or does the company enforce ""expiration"" due to whatever laws regarding making AI copies of people? This isn't answered until the very end.
As well, for some reason I cannot even begin to understand, the movie gives off the impression of being somehow post-apocalyptic or post-scarcity in some way. A scene in which a random stray dog gets into this guy's remote house seems to enforce that theme, especially since he's apparently living in the middle of the woods far away from civilization.The robots he makes are utterly adorable, named/numbered J1 and J2 and eventually J3, they are progressions in sophistication, with J1 being big, bulky, and childlike, J2 being smaller, more nimble, and talkative, and J3 being essentially a complete human replica android.
The Guy seems intent on making the perfect human replica, in the form of J3, to upload his wife's ""somnulence"" AI copy into after she died. For some reason, his boss, who yells at him over holophone every so often, cannot find this out and this is to be kept secret. Why is never explained.
At the end there is a very big and huge twist which answers much of the technical questions I had earlier, but only raise more and significant logical questions. The core of a good story is in there, but this film just didn't do a good enough job of telling that story.
It went for an indie arthouse feel to it, and I feel in the process it ended up losing a lot of its storytelling capability as a result. Emotions and themes are lost in service of moods and ambience. The human story, which is the forefront of the plot, feels almost suffocated by the environmental story.It would have worked so much better as a book or a miniseries, or with just a bit more narrative information, like ""Moon"" which it seems to be compared to.",Archive

And also the doctor.Soundtrack: nothing in particular to tell, so it go along very well.Conclusion: think that it's a movie that a sci-fi fan quite has to watch (if you are not bored about the theme).

27,Xavier_Stone,Great sisuals - but the same old AI story rehashed a bit,6,13 July 2020,The special effects and drone camera work are great and this film could have been amazing. A poor worn out story line about AI and it's usual drawbacks are given a slight variant but it's mostly similar to other movies with the same subject line; and requiring a single actor to carry 90% of the film.Moon with Sam Rockwell did it best and this tries to match the effort with sub par results.

Meaning it is quite slow-paced. But the execution is really good and I enjoyed it throughout. Not only the portrayals of the characters, but sound design was impressinve.. and wow, the sets! The production is beyond excellent. Well, it does have that cliché I really dislike of a ""smart guy"" being a complete idiot at times. But it. Just. Works. It will certainly drive the line between ""boring"" and ""memorable"" for many watchers.Personally, it has the kind of ambience and technology I love to bask in.I kept thinking about the boring ""Ghost in the Shell"" (2017) movie, and the original franchise.. Touching on a lot of deeper and layered thoughts when it comes AI and humanity. Although, as I said, it is vague in that department. Which is a blessing (leaving the interpretations of what is happening and how they'd react to the viewer, and not sullying itself with ) and quite sad, because it doesn't delve too much into it.

She is loaded into an Archive as J3 and if there too long all will be lost so George works very hard and fast to accomplish Jules to be reunited with him. George works for ARM a company that has the ability to put deceased essence into an Archive so that family and friends can say good-bye properly, but there is a time limit how long the deceased can be available.George's job in Japan is to make a formally abandoned research facility ready and his boss Simone (Rhona Mitra) is constantly on his case to finish the job by updating all the security for the house. George needs to keep making the robots a secret from Simone. So far he has made J1 (Chris Schubert) and J2 (Timea Maday Kinga) and they help him while he makes J3, who is almost done.In flashbacks we see Jules and George as a very loving couple. We do note that J1 and J2 are robots that for purposes of the movie have human beings inside them. They are big and bulky and it's easy to Imagine that in the making of the movie, that they often fell.One of the robots, J2, becomes jealous that George is spending too much time on J3 and not on her, but George tries to calm her and promises to do better.Notables: Toby Jones as ARM rep Vincent Sinclair who wants to know how ready Jules is for burial; Richard Glover as Melvin, an associate of Vincent; Hans Peterson as Mr. Elson, the Risk Assessor, who gives George a case to only be used in an Emergency, Stacy Martin is also the voice of J2 and the robot J3 and does a very credible job and she, basically, steals the show.We do see some attempts by other companies to invade the house to get all the AI (Artificial Intelligence) that ARM is protecting.This is quite a more interesting Sci-Fi story that we have seen in the past. The music is very loud at times and with it we see what appears to be videos of the insides of a robotic brain with transistors, diodes and memory sticks along with other units that make up a robotic brain.This may remind some of the movie Ex Machina, but this doesn't go there regarding sex or nudity.All in all this is very engaging and oh, there will be a very big twist later on........just so you know..................ha!

Another addition to the artificial intelligence and robotics films, among which was Ex Machina, which focused on the pursuit of artificial intelligence freedom and slightly on romance, only this one goes much further. It focuses on deeper and more serious bioethical issues, such as how one could hold the consciousness of a person who has actually ""gone"" for a bit longer by storing it in the ""archive"", a system where one could communicate with one phone call. The ""consciousness"" would gradually weaken until it was completely lost. Through these calls, one could get more time and to properly say goodbye to loved ones that are gone. But what would be the essence of this consciousness? It would have e.g. soul, or would it be a mere imprint of the dead, memories, thoughts, images etc? If consciousness still existed could we say that the beloved ones are not dead yet? What if someone took it even further and tried to store consciousness in robots to keep their beloved ones? So the film raises serious issues for the first time and despite the slow pace that characterizes the films of the genre in general, it is a pioneer in the genre and has a huge plot twist at the end that reminds of the movie ""6th sense"" with Bruce Willis. Of the films of this genre, Ex Machina is clearly one of the most well-known, but of much value is now the much older film with Robin Williams, the Bicentennial Man (1999), which I recommend as a reference film to artificial intelligence. Although it does not reach the top overall, due to the pioneering central idea it is remarkable and recommended to everyone.",Archive

He creates various versions as he gets better at it. One version is moody and depressed and so I wondered why anyone would ever create a machine with human emotions. It seems counterproductive and a waste of time and money. Hollywood needs to get a grip and stop trying to make people think inanimate objects are capable of having human traits. They are not human and should never be presented as even partially human or worthy of being treated as anything more than a machine. This is a pro robot movie already trying to sell you on the civil rights we will need to extend to a machine.,Archive

The acting is spot on and the entire film feels like a cross of Blade Runner/Westworld/Ex Machina/Moon as many have pointed out yet it has one very short brief unpredictable ending that is probably the most controversial element of the film's story.
Personally I found it to be way too brief considering how much effort was placed on the foreshadowing yet it works. It could have easily included more information about the 'outside' world especially from the wives perspective and both companies to explain why Theo's character wasted so much time in this Archive illusion to create the perfect AI for his supposedly 'dead wife' when in reality it was all done for the Protagonist to die after reaching the end. Lots of questions about his 'illusions' or 'dellusions' of breaches to his security, company wanting to sue him, etc and in the end it was all in his imagination. The film might make some feel cheated and for myself I feel it was a marvel accomplishment even if lots of holes in the plot it ends up being extremely entertaining...and might have a Sequel to answer all these questions.

At least it wouldn't have to put up with the main character anymore.His wife bounces back and forth between melodramatically fatalistic, and annoyingly childish. And I didn't find her physically attractive either, when she was alive. Although her robot form looked good.

-Great CGI (sometimes it blends so well you can't tell what is real and fake)
-Fresh take on an old sci-fi story
-Superb attention to detail
-It is easy to become emotionally vested in the two main AI
-The soundtrack has some great instrumental music but when the tracks with lyrics play I wanted to stab myself in the ears with a pencil (""Its good to wake up! Brush your teeth! Tie your shoes! I like to eat breakfast!"" smfh)Cons:-Main character is a horrible actor
-No reason to become emotionally vested in the actual human
-The script has some weak dialogue
-The chick is a horrible dancer
-Plot holes out the wazhoo (though that is expected with a sci-fi movie)
-Wtf is up with all the extreme contrasting??? It creates such bland environments when everything is artificially white.
-TOO MANY KOI - no way people in the future care that much about goldfishOverall I couldn't get over the fact that he had created these AI that looked like giant microwaves, yet was able to create a human-like AI.

67,jfost75,More than expected. Big plot twist,9,13 October 2020,"I read about this film a while back and based in the initial reviews, had low expectations. However, I was surprised to learn the reviews were mostly wrong.
The premise of the movie is an engineer suffers the loss of his pregnant wife and spends the majority of the film attempting to build an AI to replicate her and bring her back to life inside a robotic body. The various prototypes are his attempt to create the perfect human/machine blend.
The entire time, he is continuing to be threatened by the mysterious employer, threatening to shut down his project. Much of the film references these unseen intruders and their threat to his facility.
Throughout the movie, the man communicates with his dead wife via a program called the archive.
Upon finally creating the perfect AI to reconstruct his wife, we learn that the man himself is the one who died and has been living inside of a simulation the entire time and it was him that had been existing inside the archive. It's essentially a scifi version of The Sixth Sense in which the protagonist finds out he is the one who has died.
I have always enjoyed Theo Jones' acting and he did not disappoint in this film. If anything, it was the slow moving plot that ruined this film. Much of the time I felt like there was an entire story line the writer didn't wish to share. In the end it basically all makes sense, however you might spend much of the film questioning whether you should continue watching.

The movie sets a familiar storyline around the film Ex Machina (2014) but it still stands on its own. It was so painful to watch because most scenes are heartbreaking, and depending on what you believe in the emotions will pour out. If men create something it could have feelings and this film show the consequences of building phase after phase to perfection in a different humanity perspective. The decisions of the scientist made me feel sometimes hurt even though he has a sentimental purpose, but one can't be blinded to other things. I loved the ending it was unpredictable and I was amazed by the double meaning of resolve by its point of view.The composer Steven Price brings the science fiction so beautifully while adding a sorrowful feel into his music. This is the kind of film where the music must be in awe to achieve the touch of emotions and it successfully created a lot of different feelings.The cast was great, and Theo James carries amazingly the whole film but my loyalty lies in his creations.

77,ksgillihan,Oh man I did not expect that,9,11 July 2020,"This is one of the best science-fiction movies I have ever seen. Some maybe won't agree with this but for me it was damn near perfect. It's definitely a slow movie but it has a great story and thought-provoking ideas to consider. A man who is an engineer in artificial intelligence has his life blown apart by the death of his wife, right after he lands the job of a lifetime. It follows his work in developing artificial intelligence in the wake of his wife's death.Set in Japan, the main character is the only person who works in a facility devoted to researching and developing artificial intelligence. In the future, if a loved-one dies, a company called Archive can store that person's essence in a hard-drive like state but the remaining family only has a short time before the archive of their loved-one deteriorates completely. This company works to give people a chance to say goodbye to someone who died if they didn't get the chance to do so in life. There are fascinating implications that this brings up with life and death and what comes after. Our main character here has been working behind the back of the company he works for in order to insert his wife's essence into a new robotic body.Along the way the engineer has completed two prototypes in his efforts to perfect the technology required to be with his wife once again. The first model is very child-like and doesn't have much of a human-like body. The second has arms and legs similar to a human and displays cognitive abilities of a teenage girl about 15 years old. As the development of the body for his wife progresses, the second prototype displays jealousy and resentment towards the engineers new interest in making a body to download his wife into. This brings about new issues as the engineer progresses closer to his goal.I really enjoyed the characters of the first two prototypes and it really brings a depth to the story as a whole. The effects are great and the music score was enjoyable as well. The production was amazing all the way around. If you like science-fiction I think you will enjoy this movie.

I guessed it early on and was proved right. You probably will, too.This could easily have been a good one hour episode of Black Mirror, but instead lots of things were crowbarred into the silly 'corporations are bad' motif, just to spin it out for that extra hour.Excellent special effects and a pretty decent atmosphere don't make a compelling movie. There have to be some engaging characters, some sense of narrative direction and a modicum of originality... and this is where the movie stumbles.The good looking chap straight from the cover of GQ is alone in a remote lab busy putting together a robot to house the consciousness of his dead and equally good looking wife. Both of these people are annoying and do stupid things. It's like a Hallmark movie set in space.But the biggest sin of all is a filmmaker who thinks that women give a hoot about sci-fi.

I loved how the story slowly revealed itself to the audience. The biggest issue with the film, for me, was with the pacing. At two hours, this is easily thirty minutes too long. The director is trying to paint a mood with these long slow shots of the trees and waterfalls, etc. But they just go on forever and are used way too often. I found myself constantly skipping ahead because I was incredibly bored. Others may find it adds to the mood of the film. There's a fine line between setting a mood and boring the viewer. I found myself very bored.

86,ed-503-465183,I liked it. It had many layers and some surprises.,8,4 August 2020,"I thought this was a good-looking movie. The script and story were both good. It did seem to drag a little in the middle but it all paid off in the end.In an era where Hollywood turns out comic book action movies as science fiction this one was refreshingly more complex. While I'm not sure it would appeal to a younger audience because it deals with more adult themes and has a much slower pacing than today's typical offerings in the genre, there wasn't any gratuitous sex or violence. I think it would more than likely put a 13-15-year-old to sleep than it would to shock them.The ending is the payoff. So even though it somewhat sluggish in the 2nd act make sure you hang around for the end, I think you'll like it.",Archive

They tried to encourage the idea that humans are just things you can put on a floppy disc and so long as you have a floppy disc of so and so you can retain them for as long as you like. These types of movies are highly concerning to me because there is coldness, a lack of humility, and all the existential questions of mankind rest in a computer, which is dull and boring, to say the least.The acting was meh... This one dude has to hold the whole movie and he couldn't do it for two reasons. He isn't that good, and he doesn't fit the role of a nerdy scientist. Hollywood always wants to make things so unrealistic. I mean, even in some of the Egyptian movies, which we all know were either brown or black, cast white dudes (I am white), and lather tanning lotion all over them, which is just so unrealisticThese are propaganda movies to prepare us for the near future when AI and machines eventually take all our jobs away, and they are trying to get us to like AI, make them seem like they have souls, and pretty soon they will be able to vote and have civil rights. I mean, where this movie was headed was right in that direction. A big pity party for machines,, which they imply we are biological machines, but until we find our creator,they don;t know what instilled consciousness into mankind.Lastly, I want to point out once again, in the next 10-20 years robots will be taking all our jobs, and what are the people to do then? Its why they keep fining reasons to get us to fight each other because it won't be long before we realize its too late and they will have an army of these things controlled by the few and used on the many! If mankind doesn't begin to work together, then when AI is developed to the point it is getting, we will all be easily replaced able, and the the majority of mankind will no LONGER be a necessary nuisance!",Archive

99,Gorillaboi,"Boring, late-entrant in an over-saturated genre",4,18 July 2020,"Another run-of-the-mill A.I. movie about a secluded man obsessed with re-creating life in a metal body. Usually those films can be thought-provoking and innovative. But this one isn't. And results in a dry, meaningless plot with boring characters. It even has its own abysmal attempt at the Ex-Machina dance scene.But with that said, there is one very good touch to this movie. One that's unfortunately let down by the other 95% (that doesn't allow it to have the impact that it perhaps should have done). A nice idea, but poorly executed.Also, this movie is a perfect example of how NOT to use a score (music). More producers need to understand that it's not necessary to fill every second of a movie with an over-bearing score in the background. Because in doing so, the viewer loses the ability to notice which parts of the film something profound, sad, exciting, revealing or exciting is about to happen. The whole movie is filled with futuristic sci-fi ambience music; making every scene/segment of the movie feel exactly the same. Not helpful when the entire plot of the film is already set in one compound with very limited characters. It makes the whole viewing experience even more boring.If the producers of this film need to learn how to use the score correctly, refer to Moon (2009) and how it used Clint Mansell's masterful soundtrack.",Archive

107,ReaLMoisan,This is no Her or Ex Machina.,6,16 July 2020,"The movie looks great, solid special effects, wonderful production quality, with very competent cinematography and editing. In 2020, this should be the expectation, and as with most film and television media made in 2020, the writing is the weakest link. Unlike many infamous examples in horrific writing seen in these mediums lately, this film is at least competently written. The issue is what story it's trying to tell, and how it's told.There's a ""twist"" ending that actually works within the rules of the films universe, which shouldn't be high praise, but in 2020, it unfortunately is. The issue with the twist ending is that it undermines the entire journey the audience takes with the characters and plot. I won't ruin the twist, but it's on par with ""and then (s)he wakes up."" This writing device destroys the entire story, because none of it really mattered.Another issue with the writing is the characters, and their character progression and growth. Again, given the twist ending, almost none of the characters we get to know really mattered. But, even disregarding the twist ending, there's another issue with the characters. When a robot with almost no visual human characteristics named J2 is your most sympathetic character, you've done something wrong.Sure, it's an accomplishment they've written J2 to be the character the audience sympathizes with, and is the most invested in. The issue is, the film is Georges story, and once J2 exits the story, the audiences investment in the plots outcome drastically diminishes. Even J2 doesn't matter once the twist ending reveals itself, which only compounds the issue of the ending.Even disregarding the twist ending, there's still another issue with the writing; what is it trying to say? What subject matter does it explore, and what issues and topics is it addressing? Besides just telling an interesting story, this is usually the primary focus of science fiction. To explore social issues in a setting that amplifies the subject it's examining. This is where the writing truly fails from similar science fiction films like Her and Ex Machina, because this film doesn't seem to have much to say at all.",Archive

The main character delivers the humblest performance, clean and real, he really makes you believe he's the big brother of the robots without trying. I liked that they mentioned black mesa, it got me hoping that this would start a half life universe, but I believe the writers must have been just fans having fun with an easter egg. But the best about the movie, is the story, I'm so glad I didn't watch a trailer, or read about it before watching it, it's scary with the amount of trash out there to just trust some strangers to entertain you, but I don't regret a thing,! 10/10",Archive

Aside from the premise of life-like AI in general, everything else just really felt like immersive and believable Sci-Fi set in a not so distant future. The ""house"" controls and environment. The tools and drones. The security. Even the J1 and J2 robots are believable as near future (think Boston Dynamics robots but with a child and teenager's personality). The only negative thing for me was the way-too-human look of the final J3 AI (no spoilers, she's in the trailer). It felt like too huge of a technological leap from what she looked like for most of the movie -- think Nebula from Guardians of the Galaxy. They should have left her looking like that. I understand why they moved the story that way, but it just took you out of that immersive believability. And lastly, the ending. I kind of pride myself on always seeing what's coming in movies.

I really felt for J1 and J2 and what they must be ""feeling"" as their little bubble worlds in that lab were changing.There were some super sad and heartbreaking stops along the way to that ending... That ending!Initially I wasn't really sure about this movie and just watched it on a whim, but I'm glad I did. It turned out to be way better than I anticipated. Even partway through the movie, I just wasn't sure about it all, and I had a really hard time empathizing with the protagonist. He just came across as cocky, arrogant, and maybe playing a little too fast and loose with his work and didn't care who/what he hurt.But then towards the end, the movie and writing really redeemed themselves.Honestly, it's one of those rare movies that will follow me for the next few days because it really makes you think.

117,agof,...of spoilers and human brains.,6,5 August 2020,"JUMP IN THE URINAL
AND STAND ON YOUR HEADFirst of all it is actually a competent film it was captivating enough for the whole ginormous unwarranted runtime of ""poetic"" meandering. If you are into that, or if you have never encountered such thing called ""story"" before - this film can be your new favourite. My biggest criticisms of this motion picture are that a lot of scenes have really lo-fi video quality look to them, like early digital camcorders, film's juvenoia, and that J3 and J3,5 are damn humans in body-paint.
I understand that the guy makes a human proxy, and that this is a low budget film, which looks (probably) way above its budget. But at that point, if you are not going Bicentennial Man, you might just go damn Kokaku Kidotai (or Ex Machina) and say ""Our skin-technology is just this good"". Her parts are already that complex, to be recognizable as just human. So there were no reason for excessive lines and ""gamer""-design. Last model even has damn arm-hairs and goosebumps. And they go overboard with the close-ups to entirely ruin the illusion of a movie, and leave you with a filmed stage-play visuals.
Writers are bashing J2 for having development of a 16yo, as if that's not enough. You have a development of a 16yo. You are a direct and complete continuation of that you. Even 6yo J1 is already too much of development. That's already 95% state. The rest of ""development"" is actually just constant acquiring of new information - of life experience. The brain is not your ""cpu"" it's your ""hard drive"". The 7-22 period is your actual life, it's you living it and getting new experiences. It all goes downhill since ~23. From that point it's you trying to conserve what you managed to get while you had a chance. It's you constantly losing what you can't maintain. It's you slowly turning into a rabid conservative to preserve vanishing glimpses of your former self. It's you memembering, instead of learning.--------Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity. At the beginning of the film i actually though that this may be a proper tidied up version of Ubik. Dick is an interesting subject to study if you have storytelling-related hobby, but he is a terrible writer. I hoped that that barely coherent meth-trip is finally properly adapted into a feature-complete work. But alas. Ubik is a complete mess, but at least the messiness makes it open to possibilities. In a world with no rules everything can happen.
And then the kitten woke up. The ""twist"" here is as meaningless as it can be. There's not a single second of the run-time to set it up or tie into it. It's a twist for the twist's sake. Nothing in the whole film is related to it. Not the plot, not the story, not the writing, not the themes. You can add such twist to any film on earth and it would have the same effect. Usually this twist is at least somehow set-up. Here, you just know it will happen, because you've read a story at least once in your life. Not because of diegetic reasons, but because you know what a story is. It's so meaningless, it doesn't impact your experience at all. It doesn't even invalidate it retroactively. The movie is a movie you watched, and the ""twist"" is a separate thing which exists.On the other hand, it just means that this film has no story, has no ark, has no ending. It just starts, just goes for two hours, and then jus",Archive

Also a deliberate non understanding of human emotions by keeping intact emotionally undeveloped android prototypes that cause their own AI may-ham and a movie story-line diversion. What is great id the effort to create this story with a sense of physical-reality with props, CGI, cinematography and acting combined to immerse you into their reality. Nonetheless the melodrama as usual is very drawn-out and at-times wants you to fast-forward. This is not an action film but rather into the dilemma of love gone and the scary morality of electronic and mechanical resurrection of a person!",Archive

138,Left_back,Retread of some older themes,6,12 September 2021,"The story is about an engineer who tries to resurrect his dead wife in the body of an android he designs to handle the heuristic and neurological connections from the 'living' data stored in an Archive after her death some years prior.Much of this kind of story is reminiscent of scenes from Silent Running (with the helper robots), Ex Machina for the remote location setting, and a scene that is eerily similar to the cyborg creation opening of Ghost in the Shell during the transformation of J3.The engineer is in charge of a run down outpost of a research facility - hinted to be in the hinterlands of Japan.What strikes me as odd is that despite the lack of resources - he has to cobble solutions to various engineering issues with the outpost, and lacks parts to complete the design of the first two robot prototypes - is that there are enough materials and equipment to manufacture a synthetic android that is very humanoid. In fact the 3rd model (J3) is only partially formed at the beginning, and he steals the legs from J2 to complete the transformation.Technology aside, the drama tries to impart that the AI designs are advanced enough to give us an emotional and psychological triangle that results in jealousy, paranoia and suicide.The script contains too much side noise, and the film could use more judicious editing to pare the tale to enjoyable limits. If you can last to the end (and some movie goers may not) the twist was fairly obvious, but not in-your-face so.",Archive

Its almost What I got. At first, I wasnt that all excited and thought it was rather predictable. The first half was OK, but not impressed. Second half, really got me wondering and kept me on my feet!Even thou I knew his robots AI was going into the emotional states of anger, sadness and jealousy - I like how they brought up the important question of mentally illness and suicide. We need to listen, really listen and understand, how someone is feeling when they have a broken heart and are depressed. Especially in this age (the robot had a brain/mentality of a teenager).The ending was something I thought of a couple of times, but couldnt get my head around it, so I was waiting for another ending.
The ending was really taking me back to the White Christmas episode of Black Mirror. Since BM is one of my all time shows, I was rather Happy about this ending actually.

151,stanimiradeleva,Here's what's wrong with this movie,5,30 October 2020,"Read only if you have seen it (or don't want to see it).
I watched this movie a week ago and thought about it so much, that I came back here to write a review. There were so many plot holes and nonsense, that I just had to write them down.The big ""twist"" at the end was not a twist at all. It was not mindblowing, it didn't make any sense. It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and it did not add anything to the story. It was just an insult to the viewers, probably made, because the finished version of the movie was so bad and the writers had to somehow mask their creative weakness. It got the readers confused and disappointed and for one second some people maybe thought ""the movie was bad, but maybe I didn't get everything because of the twist"" and then never think about that movie again. Probably the reviews, giving 10 stars to this movie because of the ""twist"" are bots with the level of intelligence of robot ""No 1"".The guy is at the same time expert on robots (hardware) and artificial intelligence (software). He works alone, building super complicated things from scratch and doing research. Yet he looks confused and never repairs the security system in his remote house.Repairing the security system didn't matter anyway, so why was even mentioned (and took half an hour from the movie)?He builds one very simple version of a robot with AI, then a very good one, then one perfect/state of the art super amazing robot. He built a perfect robot using parts of the old robot, yet never bothered to put hands on the first version. Why?He was acting like an a****ole to the second robot and looked surprised when the robot got upset. For most of the movie, he was either yelling at or ignoring the robot and making it clear that robot No 2 is unwanted, leaving the robot alone for long hours and then wondering why the robot freaked out. The character obviously never watched any horror movies.Conviniently, his wife dies just when he accepts a project to build a robot with artificial intelligence and now he is super inspired.None of the robots had GPS tags and were disappearing like crazy, running around, getting wet, and so on - no care for very expensive prototypes.He was doing research, but completely ignored the No 2 robot, which was willing to learn and expressing feelings and complex emotions - a very interesting thing worth pursuing as research. As a researcher, he was taking zero notes. Yet, this is probably explained with the ""twist"", right.He was obsessed with robot no 3 aka the wife, but acted weird around her and did not explain to her anything.The guy that he met in the Japanese restaurant was only in the movie, so they could show some smoking. Obviously, Hollywood has a quota and has to show smoking people in every movie. No other reason.The movie was not that boring, but it was unnecessarily long and dull. There were other things too, but I managed to take them out from my memories, pardon archives. 5/10.",Archive
152,Temac,You Know When Writers Can't Think of An Ending...,4,25 May 2021,"This review has revealing SPOILERS in it. Do not read if you have not seen the film!!!When I was a schoolteacher, many of my English students would write a potentially good story but then run out of ideas towards the end. They would then resort to the 'and then I woke up, it was all a dream' scenario to wrap things up quickly. As a teacher I found this, not only boring but very lazy writing. Needless to say, I discouraged this type of ending in all creating writing exercises.But what have we here? The writers of Archive have done exactly the same thing! They have quickly wrapped up a very long and quite boring film with the good old standby 'it was all a dream'! But to be 'clever' they said let's make it his dream, not hers! Lazy writing and would get an F in my creative writing class.Nothing wrong with the acting performances. In fact, Rhona Mitra was exceptionally convincing. It's just the lazy writing that gets me. Or was it some executive poking their sticky fingers into the script? I can hear them now, ""you know, it's nearly 2 hours long and we must wrap it up as soon as possible, otherwise we'll lose our audience (and our takings)."" Perhaps we shall never know.",Archive

That's a huge imbalance in pacing. The movie is also supposed to make you think but it's not nearly as smart as the writers intended.

Theo James has the looks of a young De Niro or James Franco from time to time, but he (or his character) is quite charmless.It's strange that this reminded me of ""Moon"" so much, when you consider that the director of this film worked on ""Moon"" back in 2009. But that film is buoyed by an engrossing Sam Rockwell performance. And ""Ex Machina"" has the balance of Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Issac's performances.

The visual effects are good, except for how the last completed female robot looks ( like an ordinary human being with clearly distinguishable make-up). You keep waiting for something to happen, for a good twist, but that doesn't really happen. The twist at the end actually doesn't even fit in the whole movie concept and seemed kind of rushed. Tries to be something big, but ends up being to long with a lost focus in the storyline.",Archive

The last 3rd let's it down, the shock ending is anything but a shock and simply burns the first parts down. I think the Toby Jones scene finished it for me in retrospect. Nothing to do with his performance which is great work as always, but it demonstrates the lack of closure the film winds up at by pulling the same tired twist as other, better works.Hint. When being interviewed about your tripe filled film that ends with a tried and tested one, don't tell us you burned all the usual tropes in your search for originality.A pity, as the emotional nuances provided by the bots ARE really good, it deserved a more eloquent ending to match the set up, which is done well.

I loved the beta/analog future past meets future future feel of it all and I really hoped that it would prove me wrong. The end had a twist but it wasn't what I had hoped. It's like it ran out of steam (or budget) and wrapped up the last 5 minutes nearly in a twist that also felt tired.
Minimalist dialogue didn't help the story as is but it could have been a great commentary had they chose a different direction. There were some creative ideas for the tech though that made it more believable- sorta.

If you've seen ""I am Mother"" you can tell how you can make a good robot suit for a movie with small budget. But here you have a tasless copy of it. And wirst of all a person in a robot suit dont even try to play a robot. He just moves like a regular human in a suit. What an insult!It just shows how a director and a stunt playing a robot were not even bothered by quality. Probably just asked first random guy to wear robot suit and point camera on hit on day one.

235,bruce-58474,Archive it under the category Predictably Disappointing,2,22 October 2020,"This sci-fi drama is ANOTHER ahem, rehash of Pinocchio/Frankenstein's Monster. Only this version has Geppetto cast as another remorseful scientist that has lost his loved one and can't let go. THANKFULLY there's technology to keep her as a digital copy until he can build a new model (literally). If it sounds familiar, it's because Hollywood is notoriously bad at coming up with original material. These stories are so cringe now in their predictability,that they are literally unwatchable. Basic plot line goes like this; 1. A loved one dies. 2. the grieved has the ability bring the dead back to life. 3. There is no God or mention of God other than in cursing. 4. Ethics don't matter. 5. The dead rebel against the imprisonment at first, but then give in and accept/even try to embrace their false life. 6. But then the creator rejects the created, with complete callousness and disregard for the being's love for it's creator, it is rejected and left to dispair. 7. It will experience the range of human emotions without the ability to ever feel reciprocal love or feelings. 8. The end usually results in the death of one or both of them or one of them living on in a cold hard reality of jealousy and rage.
Sooooo Oooooold. Please come up with better material than this script which has so many plot holes, unnecessary dialogue and character development that ultimately goes no where. This movie had so much potential but gets lost in the same old cliches. The shadowy corporation, the dystopian society are hardly relevant on screen to the point that their inclusion doesn't add substance to the story and comes off as an unfinished thought from the script writer to the audience. Toward the end it seemed the script went through several rewrites in an attempt to fit an appropriate ending to an otherwise pointless story. This has the effect of leaving the audience dissatisfied with the conclusion, and wondering what the point to any of it was. Plot twists can't save this disaster. Overall this movie is like a bag of burned microwave popcorn. It started off promising, but ended up in the trash.",Archive

242,melchisky,"Possibly the best science fiction film of the decade, or so far this century",9,22 October 2020,"Most often, my reviews of movies have been mostly negative. That's because most often the emotional response provoked by most recent movies has been overwhelmingly negative. This film did not do that, and did just the opposite.This film has been one of the most thought provoking and philosophical treatment of various themes included in the film, themes that include Artificial Intelligence, the moral implications of such, and the possibility of uploading someone's mind into a computer, to give a form of life after death. These themes have been explored to great extent in a number of other science fiction movies in the past 20 years, including Replicas, Transcendence, Ex Machina, and The Machine....but this movie does it better. This movie was a pleasant shock, rather than a pleasant surprise, and I think this movie deserves and Oscar -- which it will never get, because Hollywood society thinks science fiction is for kids, rather than for adults smarter than anyone in Hollywood society.All that being said, there are reasons why I give this a 9 out of 10 rather than a 10 out of 10. Minor spoilers below, read at your own risk.....
The first 90% of this movie explores most of the themes outlined above, particularly AI and the moral implications of such, including discarding earlier iterations in favor of newer improved versions. However, there is a twist in the last few moments of the movie that change it entirely, and leave me unsure of how I feel about the movie or how I should rate it. It becomes an entirely different story at that point. It's such a radical twist that I suspect executive meddling, and have to say that it feels like two entirely separate stories were somehow meshed together, with the second one essentially invalidating all that came before. I still like the movie, but as I said, it becomes hard to say how I feel about it as a whole.However, I wholeheartedly recommend you watch this movie. I expect your feelings will also be mixed when all is said and done.",Archive

It is stylishly shot, directed and acted with aplomb by the attractive and enigmatic leads of Theo James and Stacy Martin. Indeed, the latter is well cast in her role who is both ambiguous, childlike and yet empathetic all at the same time. The wonderful Toby Jones also turns up in an extended cameo just to give it that bit extra. If you want wham, bang, action this is definitely not for you. However, if you enjoy psychological, moody sci-fi with stunning visuals then there is much you will enjoy. It is very 'Twilight Zone' with an ending I didn't anticipate.",Archive

This one is all about masterpiece writing, subtlety and art - not about action, combats or cool tech. It's closer to Blade Runner 2049 or Ex Machina than to Star Wars.Ironically the movie makes you think that it's about AI, while the title is exactly honest. I don't want to copy what has been already written, but I agree with almost all insights of user rmmil (you can find his review on imdb). The only thing I don't quite agree with is that the protagonist invented the Archive - I can't find any clues in the movie that thats actually the case (perhaps I need to rewatch).I'm giving this movie 10/10 because it's brilliant and haven't compromise on any aspect even though it didn't excite me as much as Transcendence did. In contrast Transcendence embodied some of the deepest truths about intelligence, but then decided to go for a remarkably stupid ending of ""we humans win even though we would have exactly 0% chance"".",Archive

It is very hard to express the difference from all those similar movies you have seen without spoilers so I wont go into plot any details. But it is different. The setup is very similar to ExMachina and the first half of the moive is a real slow burner. Beautiful shots and scenery but really nothing happens for a while. Then it starts to catch up in the second half. I was even emotinal for a bit for a robot, and no it wasnt the pretty female robot. All in all I recommend this movie to any sci-fi addict. Its more of an enomitional and visual ride so you should not expect any action here. What you can expect is beautiful cinematography, pretty good acting and a truly surprising twist at the end. Im not saying its flawless because it has some plot holes here and there but overall its one of the better movies of the AI awakening genre.",Archive

296,mlxyz,"More ""Moon"" than ""Ex Machina""",10,13 July 2020,"Gavin Rothery begins a new career as director with a well written and visually stunning sci-fi movie.
In 2009, Rothery was a key figure behind Duncan Jones' sci-fi masterpiece ""Moon"": the moon base, Gerty the robot and all the vehicles were all designed by him.
Now, Rothery gives another proof of his visual talent with ""Archive"".
Some people said that ""Archive"" is a sort of ""Ex Machina meets Black Mirror"", but I think that's not the right comparison.
In my opinion this movie is more a spiritual sequel to ""Moon"", with the same depht in all its charactersations and the same taste for world building and atmosphere.
Yeah, maybe ""Moon"" was more innovative, but I don't care. This is a kind of sci-fi that's extremely difficoult to find today.

299,maj-69161,Great visuals predictably disappointing ending,5,16 July 2020,"Archive started with so much promise. The story was intriguing to start but lost its way trying to incorporate genre cliches, easter eggs, and or homages to other movies. What many people took as visual extensions to the narrative of the film, ""which are breathtaking"" they are little more then space fillers and do nothing more for the film then allow to create your narrative within those silent moments. This can be very useful is some films, ie. (The Shining, or interstellar) this is not one of them. There is a clear path set out for you that is abruptly taken off course for an (upgrade) esque ending but fails to connect it to the rest of the movie. The larger entities in the movie lack depth therefore are left to the viewer to interpret. The lead is the most forgettable character as the robots show more humanity the he does, which I thought was the underlying storyline. I enjoyed j2 as she grappled with the reality of her existence and relationship to the lead. but once again left my with more questions as the end does not explain why she even existed or why we see her apart from the lead character. I would say it is worth a watch for the visuals but will not make my sci fi rotation",Archive

The scenery, the flow of the film, the background music, the atmosphere, the set, and just the film in general reminded me quite a lot of my favorite anime flicks. Also while watching this film, I was reminded of various other works that to me seemed to have influenced this film, most notably being the original Solaris film made in the Soviet Union, the Ghost in the Shell anime series, the Ex Machina film, and even the Half-Life video game.Without giving away any spoilers, a good metaphor for this film is like watching a long magic/illusionist trick evolving right in front of your eyes. After watching this film, you will see why.The story is very well written and leaves so much to think about after the movie finishes. This is always a sign of a good film when one continues thinking about it afterwards instead of just forgetting about it.My negative critique of the film is quite minimal, so I won't write about it here but instead let the viewers decide for themselves.

316,soulstorm-97777,An unexpected twist worth of Black Mirror. Lacks a bit in depth and dialogs...,6,7 January 2021,"Considering the nowadays standards for scifi movies I guess this one is not too bad. Nothing really 'new' here plot-wise, the base is still the one of mary shelley's frankestein. Isolated inventor, scientific resurrection, consciousness transfer, a bad corporation, robots... It's a big mixture that strays even on a couple of thematic scenes taking place in a cyberpunkish restaurant.
All in all, it kinda works surprisingly although the relationship between the inventor and his AIs deserved to be explored in depth. Weird as i may sounds, i felt way more sorry for the loss of J2 than for the whole car crash drama. I know is subjective but I think the teenager behavior of the second AI is the most successful thing portrayed in this movie, it touched me more than the dozen flashbacks and mourn for the inventor wife. It felt the more authentic.
Bad guys, guns, and a shortening time-line tried to build some thrill to prepare you for the end. The attempt is laughable but at least the final twist is solid and manages to save the movie, fair enough. Black Mirror taught one thing or two to the writers.
Once again i lamented the fact that drama could have been better invested, both in term of characters (some of the dialogs and interactions are weak) and plot (the final escalations of event could have build by the drama itself rather than resort to the bad guys who wanna shut everything), just my modest opinion...",Archive

What does consciousness mean? Are robots the better humans? What makes us human? What does feeling mean? This film spins a frame story that should explore all of that - but just doesn't. We, as viewers, expect the film to address the issue - but it just doesn't. Some say hat this movie is ""the same old AI story"" as before - but sadly it isn't even that. The film rambles along, unspectacular, with no interesting incidents. When something finally happens and you expect the film to be exciting: NOTHING. The film is inconsistent and misses plenty of chances to explore the interesting setting and characters in a meaningful way. The ending seems rushed, as if there was no time nor budget to continue the film and therefore as if they just pulled the plug in the middle of the plot - too bad. The best parts of this movie are Theo James and the beautiful scenery, otherwise the film disappoints too often too severly and is unfortunately not entertaining enough for it's length.

They are few in my list. And none entered it in the last 8 years. Sure, there were Many great pieces. But this one, oh my. Watch it. And after that, if you agree with my score, you'll probably also agree that those who thrown less than 8 may have overlooked some very important aspects of it. In my respectfull opinion. The funny thing is what some critisize is what makes it so subtle, refined and perfect.",Archive

327,kat1688262,Unexpected & Thought Provoking,10,11 July 2020,"This film was beautifully shot & acted. The premise is quite thought provoking and really makes you question what would you want when you pass away. Theo James never disappoints and this is another phenomenal performance. It takes an amazing actor to carry a film and he does it effortlessly. I was not familiar with Stacy Martin prior to this film, but was extremely impressed by her. She takes on the challenge of playing the different forms of Jules and makes you feel for each version. She beautifully brings the human essence to J3. I love a movie that gives you that dropped mouth & OMG moment - this one does not disappoint!",Archive

332,maxcali16,Better with each viewing! A Great Sci Fi.,9,10 March 2021,"From the great direction to the music by Steven Price who also composed Fury, American Assassin and Gravity. I absolutely adored this score.
My first viewing of this felt like a slow burn type film. After seeing the 3rd act I was shook.
Upon my 2nd rewatch and knowing where its going I liked it even more. Some lines of Dialogue have different meanings seeing it again. And the expressions.
The directing is done well too. Whole film looks Stunning. Theo James was a great lead. Now I just want this film in 4K.",Archive

334,sscheitel,Damn near perfect...,9,28 July 2021,"How this hasn't gotten more exposure is mind boggling. Everything about this movie is damn near perfect. The acting is superb along with cinematography and score. A great example of how singularity could play a role in our ability to process loss. A true ""bottled"" movie set done to absolute perfection. Never boring or monotonous and a story line that is to say the very least, complete. A roller coaster of mind bending emotions.",Archive
335,neilrance-822-568781,"If you enjoy Sci-fi like 'Moon', 'Prospect' & maybe 'Soloris' this is for yiu",8,24 February 2021,"As with other comments treat this stylish and thought provoking gem in its own right. Whilst gently paced and quiet in a lot of ways it has a really subtle emotional core, conflicts of interest and morality questions for the viewer, along with lovely production values for a fraction of the cost of bigger movies I'll bet.In our current critical age it is easy to watch a trailer and then liken to what's gone before in this genre, however it delivers what good indie style science fiction films can when other influences are borrowed and respected... not photo copied and rebranded, so give a few hours of your life...I rented for a couple of English pounds, wish I had bought to keep for a few more to enjoy again Dr m a digital vault. And along with the forementiond movies and the big hitters like Blade Runner(s), ex Machina, Sunshine blah, blah, blah. It's solid for me and is easy on the eye too.",Archive

339,ugh_the_boot,Like a dream,10,19 July 2020,Sometimes you watch a movie that really moves you and during both Archive and Moon (2009) I experienced an epiphany that gave me insight into certain topics that changed the way I look at things. The haunting but beautiful soundtracks really connect you to the experience. Everything in this movie just fits perfectly. Not really sure how many people were involved in both movies but this style absolutely nails sci-fi for me. I really wish to see more brilliant stuff like this again. Thank you.,Archive

343,benschuelke,One can never truelly understand death and the mind,9,22 October 2020,This is an exceptionally thought provoking film which questions some of our most basic understandings of the mind of an individual and what it means to loose someone. This sets it apart from other AI films in the genre. It will have you continually wondering about what defines one's own self and mankind's efforts to be reunited with the ones they have lost. The telling of this tale through the lense of an inventor in seclusion will have you questioning what is actually happening and possibly relate to the telling in a contemporary context.,Archive
344,pipmears,Written by someone with zero IT knowledge,2,8 March 2021,"Yes the actor playing George is easy on the eye and the cinematography is beautiful but my compliments stop there. What was meant to look futuristic was clunky and dated. Why did George need to give a robot a walk-talkie, surely in ""The Future"" the robot wouldn't need one. Also in the ""The Future"" the video streaming quality is much poorer than we have in the present. Why are they using giant game cartridges, why would a robot need a VR headset and surely they could build a facility without lots of door frame bottoms to trip over?! Don't bother to try and figure out the plot because the ending makes it null and void. Worth watching to enjoy picking apart.",Archive
345,jaybratene,"Slow-moving, but rewarding Twilight Zone episode",9,28 June 2021,"This movie plays out like a Twilight Zone episode. However, it is unarguably slow. Is its hefty runtime necessary to tell the story? Perhaps not. Is it enjoyable? Absolutely.The visuals are fantastic. This is a cinematic world that I would happily revisit. The plot is well-written. It may be slow-paced, but the last 25% of the movie makes up for the slow speed in my opinion. Many other reviewers share the same sentiments.This isn't an action movie. It's a sci-fi movie that makes you think. And it's great at what it does. If you don't want to watch a slow sci-fi movie that makes you think, then don't watch this.",Archive

348,booknerd-58629,Rare to like a movie this much,9,7 September 2020,"I'm a huge sci-fi fan. Wasnt expecting much. However the tenderness of the some scenes showed deeper layers than just a sci-fi flick. One scene was heartbreaking. And meanwhile I understand that everybody can have differing opinions, to miss these points and say this movie is stupid and boring, they must be missing a humanity/sensitivity chip. I also don't get why some say this movie is confusing. Did they watch it to the end? I liked the serious tone mixed with the goofiness in the flashbacks. It made the film seem real and relatable. Only drawback was the religious type expletives. Didn't need it. Aside from that, this movie had me reflecting back on it the next day. If you are looking for a dumbed down-explained in your face-movie, this may not be for you. This one takes at least 2 or more brain cells to understand it.Decent acting. Nice that there wasn't any nudity.Reminded me a tiny bit of Wall-E in a weird way with the robots.",Archive
