0,Leofwine_draca,"I liked it for Arnie's sake, but the film is hardly great",6,21 December 2016,"It's simply a case of ""good idea, bad execution"" with this flashy movie which has a great plot - based in 'the near future', it's actually not far from reality - but lots of irritating stylistic bits which really let it down. The inclusion of a loud pop song into the brew didn't help one bit either. We watch things happen in slow-motion, images shake and shudder on the screen, mixing together bits from THE MATRIX and ENEMY OF THE STATE to no good effect. Whereas those two films benefited substantially from such gimmicks, THE SIXTH DAY merely looks shallow and pretentious.Oh, how the flaws with this film are endless. For a start there's the finale, which goes on half an hour too long (something I've never said before about a Schwarzenegger movie), and then there's the action. To put it bluntly, this may have been a better film without the flashy action which doesn't do it any favours. From a silly laser shootout to a hectic car chase, this film just doesn't generate the thrills and spills of other, better action movies. I like my action detailed, whereas things happen in such a rush here that it's difficult to keep track of what's going on. Sure, Arnie gets to fight in a variety of locations, but slowing things down a little would have been a better bet. It seems like their hearts just weren't in it - bring back James Cameron, I say.Another flaw of the movie is to bring in unnecessary comic relief where none is needed. Two supremely irritating villains are there for comic relief purposes. They also lack any menace altogether - one sports blue hair, the other an eyebrow ring. They look more like goths or hippies than any substantial threat. The lightness of the script means that it's difficult to care about any of the characters or even understand them, and my liking of Arnie came from him as an actor, not the character he portrays.Arnie's acting is this film's main highlight, for me at least. Schwarzenegger really seems to have developed as an actor over the years, and here he's likable and believable as a friendly family man caught up in the chaos. While lacking the mean edge which outlined some of his earlier offerings, his screen presence is still powerful enough to make you believe he's capable of performing all the major stunts that he pulls here. A glimpse of a bulging muscle is enough to convince me that the 54 year old star isn't past it just yet. He's also pretty funny, especially when delivering throwaway lines like ""I might be back"" and ""I know who I am!"".There are two other good actors in the film. Michael Rooker looks very evil as a government heavy, although unfortunately he doesn't get to do anything too horrible to anybody. Elsewhere, Robert Duvall is also pretty good as a misguided scientist who predictably turns his back on the experiments he started with devastating results. Michael Rapaport is okay in a light relief role as Arnie's helicopter buddy, but the bland Tony Goldwyn is supremely miscast as the chief villain, as his wooden acting really lets the film down. Couldn't they have gone for somebody with a bit of menace? The music, like the action, is superficial and forgettable. The special effects are adequate, but why do they insist on throwing in dodgy-looking CGI (here in the form of super-helicopters) all the time? Some of the laser fights look all right, as does the ""abomination"" at the end, a clone who has only been 84% created - resulting in a slimy, icky creature that looks like Seth Brundle in THE FLY when he was between his ""human"" and ""fly"" stages. Sadly, most of the violence is kept off screen, and the only really strong bits I remember are a neck breaking (treated as a joke) and somebody getting their foot shot off (it doesn't matter, as these characters can simply clone themselves again). At one stage in the film's finale it looks like we're in for a nicely gruesome scene showing a baddie getting cut in two with a helicopter blade, but it just doesn't happen.Another thing that annoyed me were the amount of clichés present in this film. Plenty of times I had a sense of déjà vu, starting right from the moment there's a car chase and music very similar TERMINATOR 2 pops up. Most noticeably, though, is the influence of TOTAL RECALL here, as both films consist of Schwarzenegger on the run from government criminals who are trying to execute him, and both rely on hi-tech gear to impress. For instance, Arnold buys a life-like doll for his daughter which sits in the back of a taxi with him and makes annoying comments. Compare this with the scene in TOTAL RECALL where Schwarzenegger enters a ""Johnny-cab"" and has to put up with an irritating dummy who can't understand his instructions. The resemblance is uncanny.What this film does have is an intelligent story which basically explores all the areas of cloning, what it means, how it's done, and what effect it may have on humanity. The strength of the story is what makes this film watchable, if not unmissable. Sadly if only they'd done away with the lame villains and stupid comedy it would have been a lot better, if darker. One thing I did enjoy were the scenes that Arnie shares with his clone - strangely, it made me think of the two Van Dammes for the price of one in DOUBLE IMPACT. These are pretty funny and cool, just like Arnie himself. Let's hope he makes some good movies like he used to before he gets too old for it...",The 6th Day
1,SnoopyStyle,Cheesy near future movie,4,8 August 2014,"In the near future, human cloning is banned under the 6th day law. There are cloned pets and SimPals. Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) flies extreme helicopter rides. The family pet dies on his birthday and his wife (Wendy Crewson) pushes him to get a RePet. His partner Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport) takes over his job for a big client Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn). When he goes home, he discovers that there is a clone in his place and the dog is alive. Vincent (Terry Crews) and Talia Elsworth (Sarah Wynter) tells him that he's actually the clone. He escapes and becomes the subject of a manhunt by Robert Marshall (Michael Rooker). Drucker runs RePet and is driving to repeal the 6th day law with the help of Dr. Griffin Weir (Robert Duvall).The futuristic stuff seems random and cheesy. The production value is slightly lower. Everything looks a bit cheesy especially the effects in the cuts. Arnold is trying to revive his action career to no avail. The comedy doesn't work. The movie is an interesting concept done badly with Arnold no longer able to pull off the everyman role. The weight of yet another Arnold action movie wears this down. It's just a shadow of other better Arnold movies.",The 6th Day
2,claudio_carvalho,Thoughtful and Full of Action Sci-Fi,7,24 June 2017,"In the near future, cloning technology is highly developed and the corporation Replacement Technologies owned by the wealthy Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) is responsible for cloning pets in RePet shops. However there is a law called Sixth Day that prohibits human cloning and many groups and movements that are against any type of cloning. When Drucker needs to travel to a remote location, he hires the professional helicopter pilots Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his friend Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport), requesting an eye test from them first. However Hamk flies since it is Adam's birthday; the family dog has just died and he is thinking about the possibility of cloning the animal for his daughter. Adam decides to by a doll called Cindy instead but when he arrives home, he finds that Oliver and he have been cloned. Further, he is hunted down by four professional killers and he needs to flee. What happened to Adam and why was he cloned?""The 6th Day"" is a thoughtful and full of action sci-fi from the beginning of this century. Possible consequences of cloning human beings are shown through the family man Adam Gibson performed by Arnold Schwarzenegger in a double role. The plot has funny moments, lots of action and excellent cast. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O 6º Dia"" (""The 6th Day"")",The 6th Day
3,gavin6942,Pretty Awful,5,23 January 2014,"Futuristic action about a man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who meets a clone of himself (also Arnold) and stumbles into a grand conspiracy about clones taking over the world.I feel like this film could have been good in the hands of a different director, as the story itself is not all that terrible. But it just comes off as cheap and second-rate. We do not get many Arnold one-liners and we have to deal with some terrible transitional footage between scenes. Not even the awesome of Michael Rooker makes up for this mess. (And how Robert Duvall ended up here is a mystery -- far too much talent for this rubbish.) Strangely, the DVD features audio commentary from the composer. While I commend them for this (few special editions offer the composer a voice), it would have been nice to hear from a writer or director on how the film turned into what it is.",The 6th Day
4,jboothmillard,The 6th Day,7,28 April 2008,"I'd seen this film once or twice before, but I could only remember bits and pieces, so I was glad when I got to watch it again and review it properly, directed by Roger Spottiswoode (Turner & Hooch, Tomorrow Never Dies, A Street Cat Named Bob). The title. Basically, in the near future, the cloning of animals and human organs has become routine, but the cloning of entire human is illegal under ""Sixth Day"" laws (the ""Sixth Day"" refers to the Bible quotation of the first man, Adam, on the sixth day of Creation). Billionaire Michael Drucker (Ghost's Tony Goldwyn), owner of cloning corporation Replacement Technologies, hires charter pilot Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and partner Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport) for a ski trip. For security reasons, due to Drucker's prominence, Adam and Hank undergo blood and eye tests to verify their aptitude. On the same day, Adam is told by his wife Natalie (Wendy Crewson) that the family dog Oliver has died, and she tells him to go to RePet, a pet cloning company, so their daughter will not be upset. While Hank offers to fly Drucker, he suggests Adam should do what he is told. Adam is unconvinced after visiting RePet, and buys an animatronic doll, a SimPal, named Cindy instead. On the ski trip, Drucker and Hank are shot dead by a skier. Adam returns home and discovers that not only has Oliver already been cloned, but he sees a clone of himself celebrating his birthday. Replacement Technologies security agents Robert Marshall (Michael Rooker), Talia Elsworth (Sarah Wynter), Vincent (Terry Crews) and P. Wiley (Rodney Rowland) arrive intending to kill Adam. He manages to escape in his car, and kills Talia and Wiley in the ensuing chase, but both are later cloned. Adam goes to the police, but they do not believe him, as his car has already been reported stolen, and he is deemed insane. They call security, but he escapes before he can be captured. He goes to Hank's apartment; it is only after going back to his house that Hank is convinced of his story. Adam contemplates killing his clone but cannot bring himself to do it and they return to Hank's apartment, where they are ambushed by Tripp (Colin Cunningham), the skier who shot Drucker and Hank. Tripp shoots and kills Hank but is mortally injured by Adam. Tripp reveals himself as a religious anti-cloning extremist, and informs Adam that Hank was a clone, since he killed the original Hank, before killing Drucker, who was also a clone, and there is now a new clone of Drucker. Marshall and the other agents arrive, and Tripp tells Adam that he gained his information from informants working at the cloning laboratory. Tripp then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head to avoid capture and preventing his memory from being scanned. The agents attack Adam but manages to disable Marshall and Talia again and steals Talia's severed thumb. Using Talia's thumb, Adam sneaks into Replacement Technologies looking for answers. He finds Dr. Griffin Weir (Robert Duvall), the scientist behind Drucker's illegal human-cloning technology. Weir confirms Tripp's information about the cloning, adding that Drucker was resurrected. And the incident had to be covered up. Adam was cloned because they mistakenly believed he had been killed when he and Hank switched places, they only discovered this later and had Hank cloned as well, which also explains why the agents are trying to kill Adam. Weir explains that Drucker already died years ago, but if this information was exposed the company would lose all assets, as clones are devoid of all rights. Weir is sympathetic of Adam's plight, and gives him a memory disk of the Drucker clone, but warns that the other Adam may be hunted and his family will be in danger. Weir also discovers that Drucker has been engineering cloned humans with fatal diseases as an insurance policy against betrayal. Weir's wife Katherine (Wanda Cannon) is one of the victims of this conspiracy, Weir confronts Drucker, telling him that Katherine wants to die and not be cloned again, and he resigns. Drucker reluctantly shoots him dead after promising to clone both him and his wife. Drucker's agents abduct the Gibson family during Adam's daughters school recital and Adam comes face-to-face with his clone. The two reluctantly team up and devise a plan to destroy Drucker's facility. While Adam disables the security system and gets himself captured, the clone sneaks in, plants a bomb and rescues his family. Drucker, however, tells Adam that he himself is the clone; the other Adam is the original one. Drucker proves this by showing him hidden physical changes below the eye, dots marking how many times somebody has been cloned. Enraged, Adam fights off Drucker's agents and Drucker is mortally wounded while Talia, Wiley, Vincent, and Marshall are killed for the final time. Drucker manages to clone himself before he dies but Adam causes the equipment to malfunction, causing the new Drucker clone to be incomplete and extremely deformed. The cloned Adam fights his way to the rooftop and is rescued by the real Adam flying a helicopter as Drucker falls to his death before the facility is blown up. In the end, the real Adam arranges for his clone to move to Argentina to live a full life, while the Gibson family take in Hank's RePet cat, Sadie. The real Adam gives the clone a flying send-off. Also starring Ken Pogue as Speaker Day, Don S. Davis as Cardinal de la Jolla, Taylor Anne Reid as Clara Gibson, Jennifer Gareis as Virtual Girlfriend, and Andrea Libman as the voice of SimPal Cindy. Arnie is perhaps a little old and his trademark one-liners are a mixed bag, but he isn't bad, there is good support from Goldwyn as the villain, Duvall as the scientist, and Rooker as one of the henchmen. You can just about follow what's going on, as long as you keep up with which clone is which, and the details of the conspiracy, but otherwise you can just enjoy the futuristic world, the fast-paced chases and cool special effects, a watchable science-fiction action. Very good!",The 6th Day
5,ccthemovieman-1,To Clone Or Not To Clone,8,8 August 2006,"A good movie for DVD with terrific 5.1sound and sharp visuals, this was another entertaining Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. The action isn't overdone and the humor is subtle.""To clone human beings or not to clone"" is the question here and the topic of the movie. For one of the few times, Hollywood actually gives the right message. Wow, shocking to see Hollywood be on the side of morality for once. No wonder some Left Wing fanatics didn't like the story. The film, however, succumbs at the ending action to the typical ""Rambo mentality,"" where the good guys couldn't hit if they threw an H-bomb at them. However, most of the action scenes in the film are well-done with a lot more credibility.Arnold's thick accent doesn't credibility to his characters nor those around him in this story. Sometimes he can get away with it, but not in this movie. The villains in here are all effectively portrayed.Generally, a fun movie....and it looks great on Blu-Ray!",The 6th Day
6,rmax304823,Arnold Bench Presses Heavy Weight.,6,29 May 2016,"There isn't really much to be said about this late entry in the Arnold Schwarzenegger series. Here, or rather in the future, he is a happily married man who runs a charter tour service to snowy mountaintops. This kind of opening gives us a chance to goggle at some spectacular scenery and some equally stupendous visual effects. Watch as a helicopter folds its blades back into wings and turns into a metasonic racer twisting and squeezing through the same narrow rocky canyons that the fighters did in ""Star Wars."" A scurrilous agency has been covertly gathering DNA and cloning people, including Arnold, who sees his surprise birthday party turn into a REAL surprise.Arnold finds that he's being stalked so that he can be offed and his clone take his place, as anybody would. Bodies are flung around with abandon. Ray guns leave tunnels through human torsos.If you enjoy Arnold, you'll enjoy this iteration of his image twice as much because there are two of them. It must be said, though, that as an actor Arnold has the subtlety of a bird dog, maybe a pointer. And this is his worst performance as far as I can recall. The wisecracks are fewer and he seems to be lifting barbells while he waits for the check to be cut.",The 6th Day
7,rmax304823,Duo.,6,14 January 2018,"Ran ""Raw Deal"" (1986) and ""The Sixth Day"" (2000) back to back and its interesting to see the embodiment of decadence. Fourteen years can make a big difference. I don't mean Arnold's aging. That's a given for all of us. And I don't mean his graceless and wooden movements. That was always a given for Arnold. I mean the fact that Arnold's earlier movies were usually more or less realistic, although they sometimes reached the parameters of possibility. But later they tended to transform themselves into logical puzzles enhanced by an abundance of computer-generated images. In ""Raw Deal,"" for instance, Arnold takes a few belts in the jaw, but he can clean out a nest of a dozen or more gangsters killing every one of them. They're all prepared and armed to the teeth but it makes no difference. They shoot and miss. Arnold doesn't miss. But that aside, it's a realistic movie set in the present. We can at least IMAGINE that Arnold can shoot that much better than everyone else. The story even reaches for the surreal at times. His drunken wife throws a cake at him. ""You should not dwink and bake,"" he remarks unflappably. Later he kicks out the windshield of his Caddy convertible and drives wildly through a quarry full of enemies with machine guns. He mows them merrily down while ""I Don't Get No Satisfaction"" plays on his tape.In ""The Sixth Day"" the wit and self parody are largely absent. The pieces of the logical puzzle are there but no one really bothers to fit them together. One or two comments and Arnold has had enough of what he calls ""philosophy."" It's about cloning and the management and bioethics of same. The villains, for instance -- Tony Goldwyn in a fine performance -- have built a life-limiting disorder into each of their clones because even after cloning a psychopath there is still the possibility of redemption. What do you do if you encounter someone who is your identical clone, right down to the slightest episodic memory from childhood, carrying the same devotion to your wife and daughter as you -- and he, all unwittingly, has taken your place? You have a chance to murder him but should you? He is, in every sense except birthing, a second you, although he doesn't know he is. Isn't that murder? How about -- suicide?In any case, despite the zappy editing and loud noises, there are the usual moments of comedy. One young Gothic heavy has been killed and cloned so many times he's beginning to complain about a sore neck and has to be reminded that his spine was fractured in a previous life. A beautiful Goth woman with neon-blue hair is killed and then freshly reconstituted. She leaps nude from the table and rushes to a mirror, flushed with anger. ""Now I have to pierce my ears again!""",The 6th Day
8,Tweekums,Intelligent Science Fiction with Arnie-action!,8,12 September 2019,"In the not too distant future cloning technology has advanced to the point where people can have their pets cloned, complete with memories. Human cloning is officially some way off and illegal although there are those who believe it should be legalised.Our protagonist is pilot Adam Gibson who has been contracted to fly Michael Drucker, the mega-rich owner cloning firm Replacement Technologies. As it is his birthday and he has things to do so he lets a friend take the job without informing Drucker. Then when he gets home he is in for a shock; his birthday is already underway and he is already there! He is promptly grabbed by goons working for Replacement Technologies. Before he escapes he learns that he has been cloned, is to be illuminated because this could obviously expose a company secret and that his wife and daughter will be eliminated if they learn there are two of him. If he is to survive he will have to learn why they cloned him and in doing so expose the secret at the heart of Replacement Technologies.I didn't have high hopes for this film but when I finally got around to watching it I was very pleasantly surprised. The central premise raises interesting moral questions about the ethics of cloning; from the relatively simple idea of cloning pets to that of cloning people. Of course the copying of a person's memories as well as body will almost certainly remain sci-fi forever it is still fun to think about. More importantly it provides a solid basis for a sci-fi thriller with a good amount of action; plenty of twists and turns and plenty of tension. The action is impressive, as one would expect from a Schwarzenegger film... unusually there is the fear that he might not survive every fight thanks to the fact that there are two of him. The physical effects are impressive although some of the CGI looks a bit ropey by today's standards. Arnie is on fine form as Gibson, and his clone; Tony Goldwyn is suitably unpleasant as antagonist Drucker and Robert Duvall adds a touch of class as Dr Griffin Weir, Drucker's chief scientist. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of Arnie, especially if you liked 'Total Recall' as this shares the idea of not knowing if you are the real you.",The 6th Day
9,ma-cortes,A clichéd sci-fi thriller involved in humor touches by Arnold Schwarzenegger,6,15 December 2008,"In an Utopian nearly future , cloning is a habitual exercise, fish, dogs,animals and food can be cloned, but no human genre, being illegal and pursued.

He flees and must to solve the weird happenings from the creator of the clones, Michael Drucken(Tony Goldwyn), whose experiments is working Dr. Griffin(Robert Duvall).This is a gripping sci-fi story plenty of action, thrills, suspense,tension, plot-twists and quite entertaining. It's a clichéd thriller with noisy and agreeable fun . It builds gradually with an interesting premise leading an impressive and breathtaking highlights, thanks to involving plot is interesting enough to keep the movie going on. Action set pieces are well made and amusingly mixed with humor, the picture delivers just what we have come expecting.It's one of the best of those years generally inappropriate crop of blockbusters, but this one contains lots of action and enjoyable humor. A sympathetic and as corpulent as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good father of family plunged into a sinister scenery he tries to find out but doesn't understand. Adequate musical score fitting perfectly to action by Trevor Rabin and colorful cinematography by Pierre Mignot.The motion picture is acceptably directed by Robert Spottiswoode. He's a successful director from TV movies and cinema, as terror genre(Terror train), adventures(Air America,Shoot to kill),drama(Children of Hang Shi), James Bond film(Tomorrow never dies), and his best movie is ¨Under fire¨.Rating: Passable and good fun film.

The film also tackles theological issues, pondering the existence of a god, the soul and an after life.Thankfully, despite having an intelligence at its core (which, let's face it, is rare for an Arnold movie), The 6th Day still manages to be hugely entertaining big budget popcorn fun, packed with impressive action set-pieces, great special effects and ingenious near-future touches. Sure, it's a tad clichéd at times, particularly towards the end when the blatant 'remote control' plot device comes into play and Adam teams up with his clone to teach the bad guys not to play god, but director Roger Spottiswoode handles the action confidently and Arnie provides a typically assured performance.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",The 6th Day

Good-looking but juiceless sci-fi hokum directed with the usual overkill (car chases no longer take place on precarious roads; here, autos are sent plowing through homes and flying down stairs).

Yet viewing it now on its own chaotic sci-fi terms, it's a surprisingly brisk and enjoyable picture.Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, it's a futuristic collage of outrageous set-pieces and thought provoking thematics. Plot has Arnie as an ex-fighter pilot who discovers he has been illegally cloned, and thus he embarks on a mission of carnage and high paced machismo in a bid to get his identity back whilst exposing the evil corporation at the core of such nastiness. So, two Arnie's for the price of one then!It's not a plot that would hold up under close scrutiny, but then is that what we go into a Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie for? Quite.

The plot (for a Schwarzenegger film) is actually pretty complex--it brings up interesting questions about cloning humans (BTW the movie is against it).  The special effects are great (almost as good as in ""Total Recall"") and there's plenty of car chases and shoot outs.  Be warned however...despite the PG-13 rating some of this is pretty extreme.  It looks like it was cut from an R rating.The acting varies wildly--Arnie is his usual self...meaning pretty bad.  The scenes of him interacting with his clone are unintentionally hilarious. Robert Duvall (!!) is pretty bad as a scientist--I'm assuming he's in this for the money.  Tony Goldwyn is also pretty bad as the main villain.  The only real good acting is by Michael Rooker and Sarah Wynter (love the way her hair keeps changing color)--they're lots of fun as two killers.  But really--who watches this movie for acting?

17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Ironically not entirely original,6,6 November 2010,"Not many years from now, the cloning of humans is possible. It is made illegal, however. Still, one day, Adam spots another ""him""... with his family. This deals with the issue, what if the science was there... and it treats it surprisingly fairly, for a Hollywood film(the other end of the spectrum? The Island. Shudder). The points are made, sometimes subtly, other times... not. This has a surprisingly great script. You need to pay attention to keep up, without this being overly brainy for the audience its star attracts(no disrespect intended, we all need to unwind with sometimes that doesn't challenge us too much). We get a cool, futuristic world(with some creepy technology) with good production design and FX. And yes, this has similarities to Total Recall(and is certainly inferior to that)... it doesn't have the same message, though. We even get two Arnolds. The villain isn't half bad, neither are his goons(Rooker is dependable as usual). Rapaport does well, and is appropriately cast. The action is where this comes up short, oddly enough. We get shoot-outs, vehicle chases and explosions, and it can be somewhat exciting and tense, but it is strangely dull. It lacks the creativity that the exploration of the themes has. This is the only thing I've watched by this director(I think), so I don't know if this is a deviation from his style... we get a lot of Dutch(tilted camera) angles, and some slowed down footage. It's... meh. This has a few genuinely funny moments, and we get one-liners(of varying quality... at least one of them is admittedly memorable). There is a lot of disturbing content, a bit of sensuality, a little moderate to strong language and brief nudity in this. I recommend it to any fan of Schwarzenegger and those looking for a mainstream flick with this concept. 6/10",The 6th Day

Ironically, this is one of the Schwarzenegger starred movies that I liked for other than the action. We are definitely in a time when cloning has become more and more of an issue due to it becoming an actuality. Of course there was some fiction mixed in with the science in this movie, but ever since ""Jurrasic Park"" kicked down the door of science fiction with respect to cloning, every movie after it has gotten closer and closer to reality. From the clone centered movies that I know of, (e.g. The 6th Day, Godsend, Multiplicity, The Island, and even Star Wars II) ""The 6th Day"" has to be the best. Arnold's acting left a lot to be desired, but when doesn't it. I was focused more on the actual issue at hand: the ethics of cloning, and cloning for profit versus cloning for a greater good. The movie gave you a lot to think about while also somewhat steering you in a particular direction with regards to cloning.

Then someone decided to create this film, which has the idea but lacks the payoff. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a helicopter pilot in the future who arrives home only to discover a clone of himself celebrating his birthday with his family.

Robert Duvall plays a doctor who is trying to legally clone people since his wife is dying. Headquarters have already cloned assassins sent to kill him. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode who also made the James Bond action film Tomorrow Never Dies. Schwarzenegger appears to be having fun with duo roles. There is a scene where the clone anticipates killing the real version but cannot bring himself to do it. Duvall as the doctor is interesting because his wife is dying yet she doesn't desire to be cloned. Michael Rapaport as Schwarzenegger's partner has moments of comic relief but the role is cardboard.

He's already used them enough. But as for the movie, I would recommend for a good watch. Especially if you love Arnold films. It's a fun movie to watch and creepy at times.

Two Arnolds, of course. Although ""The 6th Day"" is an obvious take-the-money-and-run exploitation action flick with a PG-13 rating and almost immediate video release, it delivers plenty of the usual stuff which should satisfy boys under age 17.

Nonetheless, this formula flick works as pure escapism. Just don't expect anything new or anything more.",The 6th Day
27,MovieAddict2016,A lot better than it's given credit for.,8,5 December 2005,"Sci-fi-action-thrillers haven't been done very well since ""Terminator 2,"" or, if you prefer more strict sci-fi films, ""Total Recall"" (1990). Both starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now he's *back* in a film that is not only fun but conceals an important message. It's about cloning.It is the future. (""The very near future."") In the future just about any animal can be cloned at ""Re-pet,"" a store devoted to cloning your ex-pets. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Adam Gibson, a family man with a wife (Wendy Crewson) and daughter (Taylor Anne Reid). He strongly dislikes futuristic devices; in a time where people laser shave, Adam still uses an old-fashioned razor blade. His friend, Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport) is all for the future and what it holds; he even has a virtual girlfriend.But after Adam comes home one night to find someone in his house (""There's someone in my house, eating my birthday cake, with my family!""), he grows worried and soon finds a cloning conspiracy headed by a man named Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) and a scientist played by Robert Duvall who isn't quite so sure he's doing the right thing.""The 6th Day"" pretty much flopped when it came out. Not only should it not have flopped, but it should not have been so easily ignored. As we see now, with parents asking judges to ""create their own babies genetically,"" our times are nearing much closer to those in ""The 6th Day."" The film is not just an Arnie action flick; it's a bit more.The underlying roots of the film are not only important, but also contain ""Back to the Future""-type paradoxes. For example: they make clones by taking ""blanks,"" fitting them with the genetic structure of the human, then insert their memory (filled on chips of some kind) into their brains. As Roger Ebert roughly stated, when you are a child--let's just say ten for right now--you get a memory-scan or whatever they're called. Then, when you're fifty, you clone yourself at age ten. You could actually raise yourself. Of course, the question is whether you would want to raise yourself, but that's merely a technicality. And could you imagine if time machines and cloning devices existed in the same future? The results and/or possibilities are endless.One other thing I liked about this film is that they do not disclose the year. Just like ""Star Wars"" and such films, it becomes much more wonderful and suspenseful when it does not disclose the year the film takes place. In this movie, they say, ""In the very near future--closer than you think."" The movie was directed by Roger Spottiswoode, the man responsible for, among other things, ""Turner and Hootch""--that dog-buddy movie with Tom Hanks that I found pretty darn infectious and charming--and ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" a James Bond actioner I found weak and stupid. This stands out as one of his best. He clearly has an idea of the future and how it should look. Many of the actual objects of the future--from dolls to cars to virtual girlfriends--are given such familiarity and deep thought that we start to believe we really are in the future. ""The 6th Day"" doesn't try to show off the future; it sets us in the future and tries to make us believe. And it does so greatly.""The 6th Day"" is not only an important film, but an extremely entertaining one, too. On the plus side, the filming technique is very futuristic, but not the millionth rip-off of ""Blade Runner""--dark and broody. The only other film I can think of that dealed with the future and did not rip-off ""Blade Runner"" is ""Back to the Future Part II""--which used bright colors to represent its future.And as for the people who complain Arnie is too old in this movie--were you expecting his age to decrease during the filming? The nature of man and aging is involuntary--get over it already.""The 6th Day"" is the rare sci-fi film that leaves you pinned to your seat in awe. It's thrilling, fun, humorous, and adventurous.

However their hidden practice could get out to the public after a stuff-up of cloning the incorrect person, and the only way to rectify the issue is to eliminate the problem.

As he goes about trying to undo the wrongs in the fashion that only he knows how - not to pull any punches, literally and a one-liner quip to round it off.

32,Robert_duder,A second perspective years later,8,30 July 2015,"Years ago when I became a avid Schwarzenegger fan I remember watching The 6th Day and really not liking it much. I decided to check it out again recently and found myself pleasantly surprised that this is actually a great movie. It was one of Schwarzenegger's last films before he became Governor and it wasn't during the prime of his career. It was a colossal flop and is generally considering one of his worse but why? I hazard to say that this is almost on par with Total Recall. Set in the near future he is tough as nails, there is TWO of him, great one liners, terrific action...this was a lot of fun and exactly what you'd want from a Schwarzenegger film. It's interesting too that apparently it is set in 2015 (the current year) because it it still far ahead of where we are in reality but its still not completely ""out there"" for a Science Fiction movie. The concept is terrific and a cast that is outstanding. Its not a perfect movie and there are some rather campy moments mostly by Schwarzenegger but isn't that what we love about him? (Happy Birthday to him too as today is his Birthday.) The 6th Day is fun and well written with a strong cast and I can't imagine why I didn't like it the first time.Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't handle dual roles well. In fact, the special effects or double used in scenes with both of them is not great, in fact sometimes its terrible. There are scenes at the end where it blatantly clear its not him. His character is simple enough and doesn't have a lot of depth but he serves his purpose in running, chasing, shooting, fighting, delivering one liners and upending evil. This is what he does best and I think it was just timing that made it not successful. The cast of this film is outstanding as mentioned. Tony Goldwyn gives a great performance as the villainous Drucker. In the first half of the film I felt like he was underplayed but he definitely stands out in the latter half and is a great villain. You can't beat the closing scenes of him as a half formed clone. Michael Rooker is perfection as the main henchman, Michael Rapaport, Sarah Wynter, Terry Crews and of course Robert Duvall who plays a small but important part and is always a great addition to any cast. Each person mentioned has a good strong role and is well used in supporting parts.I admit that as a kid of the 80's who fell in love with that era of films I judge all action films by those standards. Putting aside the extremely sketchy special effects at various times, the action is well paced and balls to the wall so to speak. The end scene for the villain is fantastic and he himself turns out to be great as mentioned previously. The film is ending is very cut and dry and adds to the cheese of the film but I'm okay with that. Its just unfortunate they couldn't finely tune the tone of the movie to the rest of the good aspects. Regardless no one is watching Schwarzenegger films to Academy Award winning material (not that he doesn't deserve one in my opinion) but if you love Sci-Fi then there is plenty to really sink your teeth into here. A terrific obligatory car chase scene, tons of shoot outs and a story that works when it comes to clones. Even if you've seen it before like I had, give it another chance. You might be surprised. I certainly was!! 8/10",The 6th Day
33,A_Different_Drummer,"Ah, that Canadian Je ne sais quois...",5,13 January 2014,"If you are a Canadian, one of the greatest ironies you are likely to encounter in your lifetime is the ongoing ""dumbing down"" of the US film industry by Hollywood producers who voluntarily choose to shoot their films in the Frozen North so they can lop a mere 30 or 60 mil off the production cost.(Most likely, the money ""saved"" ends up in fatter executive salaries -- after all, this is Hollywood we are talking about, the place where ""creative accounting"" was literally invented.)The irony, of course, is that it was not so long ago that concerned Canadian politicians were taking draconian steps to protect OUR culture ..from those same producers! Joke, joke. Who would have suspected that, 20 years later incur ""global village,"" US producers and fast-buck artists would voluntarily move their productions here -- and voluntary comply with Canadian regs requiring them to ""top load"" said productions with"" Canadian talent"" -- both in front of, and behind, the camera. THE SIXTH DAY, a recent release starring ""The Arnold,"" is a marvelous case in point. Even if he is a bit long in the tooth, and even if his best"" Terminator"" roles are far behind him, Le Arnold really does deserve better than this soporific ROBOCOP clone which is so whitebread -- so completely lacking in personality, SO GOSH-DARN Canadian! -- that the only real ""action"" the viewer is likely to see is when he tries to beat the lineup at the urinals after credits role. OK, perhaps it is unfair to pick on THE SIXTH DAY. The same precise comment can be made about literally all the US movies done up here -- a billion dollars worth of annual production that voluntarily, without coercion, agreed to waddle unto the bar and guzzle down the cultural genomes of Preston Manning, Sir. John A., and Joe Clark. Yawn! Mandatory Canadian talent in front -- and behind-- the camera? Seems a small price to pay for those cost savings -- until you realize (yet another delicious irony!) just how different the"" artistic standards"" of our two countries really are. America genuinely rewards individuality, whereas ours is a country born and raised on homogeneity. Any good film critic can spot a ""made in Canada"" US production in the first ten minutes because the scenes are all so technically perfect, so correctly lit, so lacking in imagination, that each should come with a warning not operate heavy machinery while watching. And what about all those Canadian ""character actors"" shoved helter-skelter into those secondary roles — all part of that very same purely contractual, reverse-discrimination, cultural Heimlich manoeuvre? Did I say Canadian character actors? Hell, if ever there was an ""oxymoron"" that deserved serious scrutiny by world academicians, that indeed would-be the place to start. And, while we are accumulating delicious ironies, here's yet another. The deficiencies noted above are likely to be most obvious to -- surprise! --other Canadians. Evading Canadian content where possible, and inhaling US culture in all its legal and illegal forms, is ITSELF so darn Canadian that's practically a competitive sport north of the49th parallel. Imagine the irony -- that word again -- when Canadian viewers who have practically made a career of avoiding dry, starchy, Canadian production values turn on a ""US"" vehicle like THE SIXTH DAY, only to have their very own DNA thrown back into their astonished faces.

Arnie comes home from work only to find that he's already there and celebrating his own birthday. What a high concept idea! But the execution of it and the bad script turn it into a shambles.The action is badly done and the SFX are pathetic. I usually don't care much for SFX but I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie. Those helicopters that can turn into jet planes are soooooo tacky.Many of us doubted Arnie after Batman and Robin and End of Days (I was one of them) but he has proved himself here once again as an action hero who can still be the lead in a movie, even if it still a crap one.

The Direction is excellent!. Roger Spottiswoode did an excellent job with great helicopter shots, crazy camera angles, great use of colors, and he kept the film at a very fast pace! great job!. There is a little bit of violence. We get a severed finger, severed leg(by a laser), bloody cuts on forehead, bloody nose, and a corpse with minor wounds on it. The Acting is awesome!. Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always!, he is great in the acting department!, kicks that ass, spurts out hilarious one liners,cracked me up and entertained the hell out of me! (Arnie Rules!). Tony Goldwyn is EXCELLENT as the main villain he was very cool, played an excellent villain and was extremely menacing! i loved it. Michael Rooker is great as the other villain he was also pretty menacing and cracked me up.Michael Rapaport is very good here he had some charm and wish he had more screen time. Sarah Wynter does decent here but acts with her hair. Wendy Crewson is good as Arnie's wife and had good chemistry with him. Rodney Rowland was great here and pretty funny.

It deals with a serious topic and, although it is not too philosophical, it definitely doesn't banalize it. It is satisfactory intelligent and has just enough depth to challenge the imagination and arouse thoughts. The biggest flaw, in my opinion, is that the final twist is too predictable and if you watch carefully enough you'll know how it ends at the very beginning. It's a shame because this story has serious potential for a great mindfak. Then again, it would be too much to expect from Schwarzenegger movie.

37,The-Sarkologist,An Arnie Flick,6,16 June 2018,"Cloning doesn't seem to be as much of an issue now as it was back when this film was released, particularly since the famous Dolly didn't actually live for that long. Okay, there was been a ban on cloning in place since then, but you don't seem to hear as much about it anymore. Anyway, back then it is not surprising that an Arnie action movie, and this is basically what this film is - an Arnie action movie - came out with this idea in mind. It also isn't surprising that the bad guys seem to be the biotechology firm because, well, as one person told me the biotechnology department at his university seemed to be like some sort of James Bond super villain's lab.
 So, Arnie comes home one day to discover that there is an identical replica of him in his house. Now, cloning animals has been going on for some time, but cloning humans is a big no no. In fact not only is it illegal, but clones are considered to be void of any rights whatsoever and are to be terminated on sight. This is why these thugs appear to basically get rid of Arnie because they don't want anybody to know that they are actually cloning anybody. Well. We can pretty much guess what happens from there - Arnie goes on a rampage, kills the bad guy, and everybody lives happily ever after.
 The problem with cloning is that there seems to be an assumption that when we are cloned we pretty much become the clone, but honestly, I'm not actually convinced about that. In truth, there is so much we don't know about the brain, such as what makes us, us, that if we were to create a clone then we are probably just creating a completely new person. There is no suggestion that we are going to be able to transfer our consciousness into that new body, which means that if we are using clones to prolong our lives then we are probably just acting in vein.
 Okay, I am probably going a little too deep into what is basically an Arnie action flick, but we can't ignore these ideas because films like this are actually exploring these ideas. If we clone ourselves are our clones us, or are they completely different people. Moreso, if we are running around while our clone is running around do we experience both bodies - if not, then I guess this whole creating a replica in case we die isn't going to do us any good - we are still going to die.
 Interestingly though, there is this idea that it is not so much the rich and powerful protecting themselves, but protecting their investments. At the opening we have a multi-million dollar football player suffer a serious injury that will sideline him for, well, forever. So they kill him and bring in his clone. As such, it is actually working to make humans more of a commodity than they already are. Further, there is this idea that they have built in diseases to limit their life span, just in case they decide to do something that we don't particularly like. If that happens, well, we just kill them and then wheel out a clone that hasn't had that revelation yet - a great way to protect one's investments. Sure, they might not be the same person, but in reality that's probably what they want.
 As for the film, well, as I mentioned, it's an Arnie action flick, and if you like these types of films the you are surely going to be entertained for the two odd hours that it takes for this film to run.",The 6th Day

After some time he also understands the main purpose of the clones which is to take control of the world.I liked this movie because it had a simple but nice plot which consisted of some good scenes. The direction which was made by Roger Spottiswoode, it was good and I believe he achieved his main goal of making us understand the plot and let us follow it until the end. The interpretations of Arnold Schwarzenegger who played as Adam Gibson, Michael Rapaport who played as Hank Morgan and Tony Goldwyn who played as Michael Drucker were good. In conclusion, I have to say that ""The 6th Day"" is a nice Sci-Fi movie to spend your time with and I suggest everyone before watching it to be prepared for something interesting and different.",The 6th Day
40,Dr_Coulardeau,Science Fiction obsessed by human cloning,8,18 July 2010,"That film is not a masterpiece, for sure, even as an action film. But this film goes along with many films with Schwarzenegger that are dealing with the future. We of course think at once of Terminator. But it also deals with another theme that is popular with him: the use of technology and science to enslave humanity, I mean true real human beings. At times this ""technology and science"" is coming from outer space like in Predator. In this case, like in Total Recall or The Running Man it is coming from humans themselves. In this case it goes slightly further than in other cases. We are not speaking of robots, of the misuse of television and so on, but we are speaking of cloning. What happens when the inventor of a new technology that enables the cloning of a man in twenty minutes, including his mind, memories, etc by the recording of all that via an eye scanner, is using the technology to reproduce himself and his associates? What happens if that inventor is able to inject into each clone a fatal disease that limits his life span to five years maximum, and only the very few at the heart of the plot would be free of that fatal gene or could be cloned again without it? The story of course does not answer these questions really because Adam Gibson (a good old name for the one who will regenerate the creation of God, the creation of the first Adam on the sixth day of his work) self-appoints himself as the one who is going to clean up the plate and he does. The details are in the film. The film adds on this plate the fact that Adam Gibson had been by mistake cloned and then two Adam Gibsons have to cooperate and to survive together, a good lesson of humanity for which the family is the inalienable unit that any man in this family has to defend. Slightly man-centered, but that is no real accident. The man portrayed here is slightly old-fashioned. That's why he is against cloning and that's why he is a slight but gallant male chauvinist. Just watch the film for the action and do not compare with memories of yours. This film borrows a lot from various other films or from novels.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",The 6th Day
41,johnnyboyz,One of 'his' Greats,6,14 July 2002,This is great! one of Arnie's best films! His career may not havevery active recently what with Collateral Damage a come back filmalmost but the effects and acting are perfect. It occurred to me as aMatrix type film. It was always going to be difficult what with thefuture effects to deal with but they got it spot on. Some of thecontent is hilarious! I recommend this to any action film fan. You'llenjoy it for a laugh.,The 6th Day
42,damianphelps,Should Have Delivered More,6,20 February 2021,Its an interesting enough story to work with and a fairly capable cast to carry the film but it just fails to deliver either a real exploration of the scientific ethics or enough action and drama to deliver something else the popcorn elements of the film.Lots of issues with plot holes etc.Like 95% of The Schwarz films The 6th Day is entertaining enough. Its a shame that it wasn't allowed to go to the next level to become something quite special.,The 6th Day

44,FiendishDramaturgy,Intelligent action/mystery in the cloning genre,8,16 October 2003,"Impersonated by ""Impostor,"" 2002, this production is far superior in many ways. The casting was excellent; many of the main players having had only obscure parts until now, lent a crisp freshness to the production. Even with a few of them lacking in experience, these performances were completely professional and the characters were developed along the way well enough to enable the audience to care about what events occur.The mental turns this production takes are quite clever and intelligent, and demonstrates a superior directing ability. The scenery, sets, and background content are all quite well done; as if real thought went into each detail and scene, rather than just throwing a house together, decorating it like a mobile home and a hearty, ""...send those actors in there!"" Very nice.The story itself is quite disturbing down on a deeper level where people seldom reach you. It was both thought provoking and compelling. I found this movie hauntingly disturbing. We ~are~ in the age of cloning, after all.This is one of Schwarzenegger's best films, in my opinion; one of many very entertaining, intellectual action films in which he has starred. While there was not much science to this science fiction, it was still extremely entertaining. If you liked Terminator 1 or 2, Total Recall, or True Lies, you will thoroughly enjoy this wonderfully-written, (almost) directional(ly art-house) work of art.It gets a sound 8.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",The 6th Day
45,elshikh4,"No great action, satire, or Schwarzenegger !",6,2 December 2016,"In the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, Arnold Schwarzenegger's name always meant big and loud action. But since the second half of the 1990s, things weren't the same anymore with (Batman & Robin - 1997), (End of Days - 1999), and (Collateral Damage - 2002). So, at the time, I skipped (The 6th Day - 2000) since I wasn't so enthusiastic about it. However after 16 years, I watched it. And - sorrowfully - the result wasn't any better than what I expected!Schwarzenegger looks rundown. While he was 53 year old, he seemed like 65 at least (how about 53 as older than his character already!). I believe he was recovering from a heart surgery that he had before filming. So you can touch the heavy make-up which tried to hide both his age and exhaustion. It's bad that there is no one beside him in the whole movie. Although Tony Goldwyn was fine as the cold-blooded evil guy, but he lacked the star power and the high charisma. Robert Duvall was pale, doing it in it for the paycheck. Michael Rapaport wasn't funny, and seemed strangely confused all along. Michael Rooker played the same nervous, weary, and sweaty baddie in nearly 2 million movies in the 1990s alone. And this round, nothing was enjoyable about his performance, as usual!The action is all about endless, no dazzling, laser shootouts that take place in half dark garages. Everything feels cheap. I didn't run into production values that could be called grand. Even the climax, with saving a helicopter from crashing into skyscraper, was exposed as something done inside the studio! Director Roger Spottiswoode, who I adored back then; thanks to his action masterpieces (Shoot to Kill - 1988) and (Tomorrow Never Dies - 1997)--did it no less poor. I don't know why he got that fetish over the slow-motion? He drowned his movie with it, unnecessarily and pointlessly. Then those gaudy electronic-ish cuts, like we're watching hallucinations of a robot! And in some moment, he chose to distinguish one of the killers' failure by playing a somehow lengthy rock song in the background. So what was that about?! As if the MTV interrupted the movie suddenly! Sadly, Spottiswoode wanted to be ""hip"", but lost ""cool"" in the way.The story is similar to Schwarzenegger's previous movie (Total Recall - 1990), yet with less imagination and surprises. It has a consumed plot, which its timeworn skeleton is visible behind every event, to the extent that you become bored with the movie very fast. For instance, the lead becomes a fugitive, while he's innocent, so he runs away from his chasers by jumping into watercourse; well.. IT IS, indeed, (The Fugitive)'s same scene 7 years earlier! Moreover, it opens the door for plenty of logic questions: While the lead is cloned to cover up assassinating the company's owner, which might expose the human cloning business--wasn't killing him more practical and less expensive?? And considering the ending, what about that clone's presence in one country with his original self?! Wasn't his death, while sacrificing for his original, more dramatic and less complicated??The movie says that cloning is bad; when the lead explodes the evil guy's laboratory. Then, the movie says that cloning is good; when it leads to human heroes who deserve life; therefore, the lead's clone is left alive in the end. Contradiction.. Right?! Also, notice well that the lead hated how cloning could give humanity the gift of immortality, while he accepted eventually the cloned cat; namely the cloning that could give humanity the hated immortality! SO WHAT IS THE MOVIE'S MESSAGE ABOUT CLONING EXACTLY??!!The climactic sequence dragged a bit. The one-liners were so limited. The evil guys were mostly meant as comic relief, but that was done pathetically, to end up as not menacing or comedic either. The ""Sim doll"" was meant as a relief as well, however served as an awfully creepy factor instead; OH MY GOD, I still have the shivers!Trevor Rabin's theme music is a clear play on John Barry's theme music of (On Her Majesty's Secret Service - 1969). Just listen to the 2 of them, and you'll easily find out that the first stole the second, yet after changing couple of notes. I think that was an early example of the ""Temp Music"" which fills Hollywood's movies nowadays, as masked plagiarism that proves nothing but frightening bankruptcy.The movie's ""good"" side can be existed by a few advantages. The make-up of Tony Goldwyn's last imperfect clone was perfect as an execution and as an idea; since it revealed his truth as an ugly monster, or Dr. Frankenstein who turned into his grotesque creature. I loved that long list of futuristic inventions which the movie cleverly created and snappily showed as daily life details: The mirror / TV, the refrigerator that has a memory, the remote controlled helicopter, the holographic lawyer, therapist, and girlfriend.. etc. And the visual trick which gathered 2 Arnies in many cadres was semi-flawless.Cloning Dolly the sheep in 1996 send the world into a frenzy. Hence, for the next 10 years, Hollywood kept producing one movie after another, to exploit of the issue, in every possible way. Just remember: (Multiplicity - 1996), (The Avengers - 1998), (Repli-Kate - 2002), (The Adventures of Pluto Nash - 2002), (The Matrix Reloaded - 2003), (Godsend - 2004), and (The Island - 2005). (The 6th Day - 2000) was part of that cycle, as an action with satire, made under the name of super star. But it had bland action, muddled satire, and star who looked anything but super!",The 6th Day
46,strong-122-478885,Two Arnolds For The Price Of One Was Still A Rip-Off,2,5 July 2015,"In this $82 million, ""sooner-than-you-think"", Sci-Fi yarn about human cloning, neither fantastic stunts nor expensive visual effects could ever save this utter mess from being reduced to the level of a predictable and decidedly confused ""cat & mouse"" snore-fest.In ""The 6th Day"" I quickly lost track of just how many people (especially those in high-ranking positions) were in on this whole cloning conspiracy. This business got so out of hand that, before long, it became quite laughable.And, since ""The 6th Day's"" storyline was dealing with the controversial subject matter of human DNA and cloning, I just knew that the topic concerning Christianity's ""god"" would inevitably enter into the equation, as well as the whole tired issue about ""family values"", too.And, speaking about Arnold Whats-his-name (who was paid $25 million to play the Adam Gibson character) - At 53, I thought the ""Austrian Oak"" was clearly too old for his part. And the utter nonsense of his character playing a game of deception with his own clone was just too-too stupid for words.It really killed me that in ""The 6th Day"" cloning was so far advanced that it only took the pressing of but a few buttons and, then, ""Presto!"", in a 2-hour time-frame, a person was entirely cloned, right down to their memories, their idiosyncrasies, etc., etc., etc..... (Sheesh! Spare me!)",The 6th Day
47,Chris_Docker,Enjoyable sci-fi hokum,6,8 January 2001,"Sci-fi hokum from Schwarzenegger that delivers more or less what it promises. He comes home one day to find he has been cloned. What's more, the clone is enjoying his birthday party, cuddling his daughter and making whoopee with his wife. Once the basic dilemma was out of the bag I was worried about whether the film would maintain enough momentum, but it manages it quite well and I enjoyed every minute of it. There's plenty of gags about ""near-future"" inventions to keep sci-fi fans happy, even if the main premise is riding rather shakily on the recently completed Genome Project. Not an outstanding movie, but an enjoyable one for most sci-fi fans.",The 6th Day
48,jimbo-53-186511,Schwarzenegger vs Schwarzenegger,7,27 July 2015,"Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) heads to work one day and on his return from work he discovers a clone of himself celebrating his birthday with his family. Cloning of humans is illegal and, for Gibson, discovering his clone is potentially bad news for both Gibson and his family as it means that the secret that they're trying to protect could end up becoming common knowledge. The organisation responsible for cloning Gibson will do everything in their power to protect their secret even if it means killing Gibson and his family.As a concept, this is very interesting and it's the sort of film that provides you with a nice piece of escapism. The subject matter of cloning humans is ripe for all kinds of social commentary - would you want another chance at living again after you've died or would you just rather die naturally and let your loved ones mourn you and leave your memories with them? Although the cloning aspect is a forerunner for the film I did like the idea that one aspect of the film showed someone who didn't want to be cloned - yes it's too far-fetched to be taken seriously (it's science fiction after all), but it does make you think whilst the film is running.As with most Arnie films, this one is very entertaining and lots of fun. Hank and his virtual girlfriend, the virtual lawyer and the virtual psychiatrist - all these characters were only in the film for a short period of time, but all of them were very memorable and very funny. I think the funniest part of the film was when Gibson was trying to ring the police and he kept being given lots of options before he could be connected to the police. This may have been mildly amusing back in 2000, but in 2015 when virtually every number that you ring now gives you these irritating options before you can actually speak to a person ultimately made that scene incredibly funny. When the two 'Arnies' cross paths later in the film these scenes also provide for some very funny exchanges. Arnie doesn't have quite as many 'one liners' as in previous outings, but we're treated to a great one towards the end of the film.As much as I enjoyed this film I did find one or two weaknesses; I understand that the idea of cloning animals was referenced in the film because it's legal to clone animals, but illegal to clone humans. However, I felt it would have been better if the writers had just made it about cloning humans. The idea of cloning animals just isn't that interesting and the fact that it seemed important at the start and then was ignored for the rest of the film also seemed a little bit strange. I also felt the finale was a little over-blown and ran on for too long, but these are minor issues.Despite some minor issues with the plotting, The 6th Day is an entertaining, fun and mostly thought-provoking film that is well worth watching. Whilst it doesn't quite reach the greatness of Total Recall (Arnie's other big sci-fi film) it's still a very good film that fans of Arnie and fans of sci-fi will not be disappointed with.",The 6th Day

Schwarzenegger got me into movies.
I've followed his Amazing Career as the King of Action & i loved his 2000's films too as i did his great 90's films.Arnold's ""The 6th Day"" is an action packed sci-fi Thriller with Arnold giving two performances as this is a Clone SCI-FI THRILLER.
The 6th Day is a dark & moody sci-fi film with some Cool action scenes & fantastic special fx.
Schwarzenegger is excellent here in his duel roles as two Adam Gibson's, his Adam Gibson is a fun family man & helicopter pilot but ends up getting Cloned & mixed up in a dark world of corrupted corporations, professional killers & Clones.
I really like the dark futuristic look of this film that is helped with it's winter setting but it's also very slick looking at times with it's futuristic malls & vehicles, reminded me abit of Schwarzenegger's 1990 sci-fi Classic ""Total Recall"" which is very cool.
I love these types of ""What ifs"" sci-fi movies about what may happen in the future!!!
The cast is Awesome with obviously the king of Action ""Schwarzenegger"" & we have the always enjoyable Michael Rapaport as Adam Gibson's best friend & work mate ""Hank Morgan"" & Michael Rooker playing another serious badguy type called ""Robert Marshall"" & the legendary veteran actor Robert Duvall as a troubled doctor ""Griffin Weir"" working for the Cloning corporation & Tony Goldwyn as ""Michael Drucker"" the man behind the illegal cloning corporation, an excellent solid cast.""The 6th Day"" is a very underrated movie but is one fun action packed exciting Thriller with a well made futuristic setting & a dark tone to it all, i have always enjoyed this film & genuinely love it's look & tone & double the Schwarzenegger!!!

Now if you're excited about seeing this movie you've definitely got a problem or you should at least interview for a position as Arnie's campaign spokesperson for whatever new office he tries to get. Seriously though, this movie takes a series subject and throws at it explosions, glass breaking, 1-dimensional bad guys and not 'one' but 'two' good guys who happen to be the same person.Now if that's not minimilizing something as important scientifically as clone-research, I don't know what is. On the entertainment level, if you like action there's plenty of it but similar to other action-filled movies it's nice to have people you believe in or care about or the action is worthless and has no meaning(as it does here).

I hope Arnold will do more films like this! To all highly recommend it.",The 6th Day
53,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Terrific Schwarzenegger vehicle,8,21 May 2016,"The 6th Day is a brash, in your face sci fi actioner with some deft scientific notions that it plays around with in near satirical fashion. It chooses to shoot most of its scenes in my hometown of Vancouver, including a set piece atop the spiral shaped Vancouver Public Library tat sends sparks raining down into the streets and choppers spinning wildly to their demise. I love when films shoot here, because it gives my city an exciting chance to be a part of escapism, and it's amusing to watch them digitally maim all sorts of landmarks and then chuckle as I see them intact on my way to work the next day. Schwarzenegger, in one of his last great flicks before his deliberate hiatus (we shall not speak of the abomination that is Collateral Damage), plays Adam Gibson, a helicopter tour guide who has a strange blackout in mid flight while transporting the CEO of a swanky scientific corporation (slick Tony Goldwyn). He arrives back home to find a clone of himself living with his family, and things only get weirder from there. He has stumbled into the inner workings of extremely illegal experiments involving human replication, and Goldwyn & Co. are none too pleased about it. Goldwyn has secretly made human cloning an everyday thing for the company, hidden from the aging eyes of the moral upright doctor who founded the company (Robert Duvall). This is all enforced by a ruthless corporate thug for hire (Michael Rooker) and his foxy assistant (Sarah Wynter). Schwarzenegger is faced with the daunting task of taking down this un-sanctioned empire, reclaiming his family and blowing up some stuff along the way. It's a terrific flick, and Arnie gets to say the best line he's ever spoken, directed at Goldwyn, which I won't spoil here but it's pure gold. Goldwyn is hateable and malicious, the horrific third act prosthetics fitting him like a slimy glove. Duvall strikes a noble chord and almost seems to have wandered in from a more serious film. Rooker is intense, evil and scene stealing as always. Watch for Wendy Crewson, Michael Rapaport and Terry Crews as well. In a movie so committed to the trademark Ahnuld fireworks, it's cool to get a whiff of actual thought provoking, Asimov-esque intrigue with the cloning, a concept which is fully utilized and really a lot of fun here.",The 6th Day

There's some good plot twists in the movie and offers something different than the usual Blockbusters from Hollywood. Despite the interesting premise, this film was an box office disappointment. When it was released in November of 2000. When ""The Grunch"" took over the box office of that month. Despite some good reviews by some of the top critics. This is surprisingly light, since most of Schwarzenegger's best action movies are R-Rated. This movie even reminds me of ""Total Recall"" a bit at some scenes of this motion picture. The cast seems to be having a good time here, Micheal Rapaport appears in a small role. Schwarzenegger is good as usual in these kind of movies and Duvall has some good moments as well. This futuristic action/thriller is worth a look. Written by The Wibberleys.

57,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"A movie that had a smart idea,...but used it as a Schwarzenegger vehicle",5,31 August 2014,"As time continues to move forward, the technological advances that are made, will too move forward. It's a movement that will never cease and sometimes has the ability to open doors that shouldn't be opened. Today, cloning is a possibility - it's no longer a question of how. The question is when, and would it be a good time to make it available for the public to use. At this time, it's not an easy question to answer. There are numerous pros and cons that need to be looked at before making anything official. The biggest issue however is, who's going to be in control of it and can society trust them to take care of it properly. These specific bottom line questions are the basis to this sci-fi thriller. Unfortunately, with that come other problems.In this future, cloning another human is an illegal act. When Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) discovers that he's been cloned, he finds out that out that one of them needs to be taken out. In some respects the story feels like a carbon copy of Total Recall (1990), a much better Schwarzenegger film involving an identity crisis. With that said, there are aspects to the writing that is different because cloning is the footing to the plot. One of the problems is making this an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. It's not to say putting Schwarzenegger in the film was the wrong choice, but making him specifically apart of the plot and not the topic was the wrong decision. If this movie were supposed to raise awareness of cloning, I'm pretty sure people would be more concerned about the topic than an extra Arnold walking around. This is where Roger Spottiswoode misses the mark in his directional skills with this thought-provoking concept.Nonetheless, cast wise there is only a few actors worth mentioning because every other character is uninteresting. Schwarzenegger still delivers his lines with comedy so at least there are some lighthearted moments. Tony Goldwyn (the voice of Tarzan from Tarzan (1999)) plays Michael Drucker, a billionaire in the realm of cloning technology. This guy is just like a politician even though he's not anywhere close to one. Then there's Robert Duvall playing Dr. Weir, a supporter of cloning. These three characters are the only individuals that have development. The best of these three however is Dr. Weir. There is one specific scene that opens his eyes to reality and its gratifying to see. Oh, there is one other actor worth mentioning here – this is Terry Crews' film debut. The year 2000 is quite some time ago.Other than this, the final elements that complete this movie are not that entertaining. You would think because it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger in a Sci-fi film, it would have decent action. Not here. This movie just contains a lot of laser shootouts. It's really not that exciting. The special effects that coincide with these aren't that spectacular either. Trevor Rabin's synthetic score to the film was average. At times he did emulate the electronic tunes that went well with the genre, but there were also other times where it was just plain and bland. There was no main theme that was memorable. The most obnoxious part of this movie was the editing, and the crew had three editors! It was like they were all fighting for different editing styles. There are numerous cut scenes that zip through the dialog and it's unclear to what's going on. That was annoying.The few main cast members give okay performances along with its message of the dangers with cloning. Though other than this, much of it is boring. The action, music and the rest of the cast and crew are dull in a number of ways.",The 6th Day
58,eric262003,Fun Film to Free Your Mind,7,24 September 2012,"When it comes to Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, ""The 6th Day"" has a very compelling story with a remarkable plot. It sort of has similar intentions like ""Total Recall"", with it science-fiction hell-bent on confusing its audience based on identity guessing. But ""The 6th Day"" exceeds ""Total Recall"" in that it emphatically brings up some interesting pondering subjects based on human cloning. But since Arnold's the big man on campus here, and that means profanities are thrown in this movie and in addition to that, the film is not made to enhance your intelligence, it's good for the entertainment purposes. The script offers nothing new as we know all along who's the real Adam Gibson (Arnold) and who's the cloned replica. But the subplots are quite riveting enough to keep its viewer glued to their seats.Directed by Roger Spottiswoode hits the chords perfectly with action and drama and pacing comes across very well in terms of execution. Arnold fanatics might be distraught that the action scenes seemed watered down quite a bit in comparisons to his other films before this one, but the action scenes are still engaging and fans of this genre can still remain satisfied.The ensemble turns in their best efforts regarding the material that was given to them. Arnold still plays out the roles he's good at which is limited dialogue, flexing those biceps and flashing his spaced out teeth during action scenes. His acting has stepped up a tad better than his other films, and character is provided with strength and vulnerability and his stoic expressed tongue in cheek humor is very subliminal. Michael Rapaport has the most comical relief and adds funny scenes involving he and his girlfriend. Tony Goldwyn shines as the villainous scumbag who runs a cloning factory. And Robert Duvall is excellent as the scientist who remains cautious of the crazy things going around.To summarize, ""The 6th Day"" succeeds in making the story and the plot very captivating. The idea of cloning should have more further emphasized, but it still makes up for the always popular good vs. evil story.",The 6th Day
59,Sandcooler,"Starts of poorly, but it grows on you",6,31 August 2012,"The fun thing about Arnold Schwarzenegger's career is that despite his somewhat limited acting abilities (and that's putting it kindly), you can still put him in a lot of different stuff. Obviously he's at his best in bare-bones action a la ""Commando"", but in his own unique way he's also pulled off some excellent comedy roles, like in ""Kindergarten Cop"". One thing he just absolutely can't do however, is drama. The first half hour of this movie features a lot of long dialogues and scenes of Schwarzenegger being an everyday family guy, and that's even more awkward than you might imagine. Thankfully all of this is well worth sitting through, because eventually ""The 6th Day"" turns out to be a very enjoyable movie with good action and a surprisingly interesting plot. Particularly the scenes in which Schwarzie meets his own clone stand out as well-done, very convincing and laced with a cheesy sense of humor. Sometimes the logic isn't all there, but who really cares when a movie's directed and acted with this much contagious enthusiasm. Maybe not the greatest film ever made, but thrilling nonetheless.",The 6th Day
60,philip_vanderveken,What's worse than Arnold Schwarzenegger? Two Arnold Schwarzeneggers!!!!,4,26 December 2004,"I guess the real fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger will be really delighted when they see this movie. It offers everything his movies always offer: a lot of action, some one liners and a lot of explosions and shooting. Personally I'm not a fan of his movies, but I have to admit that this one wasn't even the worst he has ever made, at least not when I forget about the ending.The story isn't that bad. It's situated in the near future and cloning has become something normal. It's forbidden to clone humans, but there aren't any laws forbidding the cloning of pets. But we all know what humans are like: there is always someone who wants to go a step further and do what is forbidden. Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) accidentally discovers he has been cloned and wants to stop his clone from taking over his family and the company from cloning even more humans. In the beginning he tries to kill his own clone but later they will work together to stop the company.At first I thought this would be a very entertaining movie. As I already said, I'm not a fan of Schwarzenegger's work, but that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy any of his movies. The idea behind the movie was interesting, but in the last 45 minutes it all goes terribly wrong. All you get then is a lot of shooting and explosions, some Christian nonsense on how sacred life is and that there is only one God whose work should always be respected by man (BLAH BLAH BLAH). I'm not saying I believe cloning is always a good thing, but I don't think it will be like it is predicted in this movie. However, I'm sure that there are a lot of people who are actually convinced it will be exactly this way. I'm sure they will all be even more convinced that it is bad and should never be allowed.The acting isn't really exceptional either. The only one that is quite good is Robert Duval. It was interesting to see him play a doctor who works on the cloning technique. Schwarzenegger was, how should I say this gently, himself. He spits out some one liners with an awful German accent, never really acts but thinks he's the best actor and the funniest man in the movie. And to make things worse you'll see him in a double role...I'm sure many people will have a lot of fun with this movie, especially the fans of action movies, science fiction and the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Personally I'm not really a fan of any of the three. That's the reason why I give the movie a 4/10.",The 6th Day
61,Luigi Di Pilla,Average sci-fi thriller,6,16 May 2004,"THE 6TH DAY hits the very important subject ""cloning"". It shows in a near future how the methods would function but in a very unrealistic way. Anyway, it lets you impressed how the humans would be cloned. I missed the suspense but there were instead some good jokes and action scenes that looked sometimes too cartoonish. Don´t expect more than an average sci-fi thriller. My wife and me vote 6/10 that matches nearly the IMDb rating of actually 5,9. For all Arnie fans: if you liked this movie don´t miss END OF DAYS or T3 with Arnold Schwarzenegger.",The 6th Day

The 6th Day is somewhere between his average and his best movies, and is a must for all Arnie fans.The plot is actually pretty good, in a world where you can clone your pet if it dies, and be unaware of the difference, Arnie finds himself cloned, and is left on the run from the people who cloned him, (standard procedure, you can't have two Arnies running about, or can you?) With a pretty good cast, plenty of action and some neat visuals: coupled with a cool story, good script and some Arnie one liners.

64,mstomaso,Anti-science propaganda couched in pseudo-philosophical moralizing MILD SPOILER,4,26 May 2005,"The great things about this film are the high energy action sequences with an aging and only slightly unbelievable Arnold Schwarzenneggar. What is far from great, however, is how the film does a half-assed job of dealing with an ethical issue in what ought to have been a thoughtful way. The film treats the issue of cloning in an amazingly misinformed and ignorant manner and rides on a remarkably idiotic script.Don't people consult with real-world scientists when treating scientific issues any more? Assuming Western civilization survives into the 22nd century, people will likely look at this propaganda film as an example of the savagery of 21st century life, inhabiting the same cinematic context that Reefer Madness enjoys today.It is clear that a lot of thought went into this film. However, thought without the support of FACT is about as useful as a teabag without water. Thought is a means to great things, those great things can not come to fruition without a proper context and without the support offered by... reality.Arnold (who is really the only personality in the film) gets illegally cloned for no apparent reason (the plot is not driven by necessity, but rather, by the writers poor conceptualization of the moral implications of cloning), and his clone, not being aware of the fact that he is a clone, takes over the REAL Arnold's life. A lot of people, in fact, get cloned for no apparent reason, and then get shot for equally inconsequential reasons. I will not spoil this by going much farther, but I have to admit that the ending is WORTH the effort of suspending disbelief through all the absurdity of the first 3/4ths and is the reason I gave the film a 4 instead of a 1. (Politically, most of the movie is a 1-) This is NOT a film about the REALITY of cloning. Rather, it is a paranoid, empty and weightless attack on the whole moral concept of cloning - and by implication an attack om science and medical progress. Science does not and can not progress by weak, cowardly half-measure conservatism. If this were its mode of operation, we would still be treating communicable diseases with mercury injections and sweat baths as we were just a hundred years ago. We are constantly beaten over the head by movies like this - with the message of science's potential to destroy all we hold dear. Folks, your politicians invented the H-Bomb, not the scientists in the Manhattan Project, and certainly not Einstein, upon whose work its technology relies. And worse... the politicians were also the ones who used it.One of the questions the film treats - seriously - is whether or not clones have souls. Getting past the fact that ""souls"" are not definable through any rational thought process and really have no place in movies concerning scientific themes, clones, being more or less exact genetic copies of existing organisms, have as much soul as any other creature. How could it be otherwise? Fortunately, this film does not provide a clear message in the end, despite the heavy-handed future-phobic paranoiac ultra-right-wing ignorance pervading the first half of the film. Worth watching, if you can stomach the stupidity to get to the rather ambiguous but reasonable point.",The 6th Day
65,Stephen_A_Abell,Buy One Schwarzenegger Get One Free... Great Value For Money...,7,11 September 2019,"Arnold delivers again... twice.The writers, Cormac and Marianne Wibberley give the audience a well-thought-out and structured science fiction tale of cloning. Adam Gibson is having a great life. A woman and daughter he loves. A successful business. A perfect best friend and business partner. What could go wrong?Unfortunately for Adam, he's about to find out. The Wibberley's are masters at climax development. They start by slowly introducing Adam to a few strange situations. These start to pique his attention, though it's not until he returns home that the depth of the mystery hits him. Before he can open the door he spots a strange man with his family... it's him. Then before he can enter and confront himself the shooting starts as a mysterious team turn up to take him away. From here on in Adam start to workout and find the answers to the myriad of questions in his mind. This story in itself is strongly plotted enough to keep the attention of the audience.There is one slight irk I have with the story and that is with the constant re-cloning of the team. I can understand them bringing the leader back, Robert Marshall, and maybe Vincent, whose the heavy-hitter - but the cannon fodder... If the process costs so much why re-clone useless mercenaries when it's probably cheaper and better to hire new blood.Should the story fail to keep bums on seats, then Spottiswoode's direction is more than enough to make up the slack. Everything in this film is well choreographed. A few things are reliant on special effects. Especially Adam's flight business as he and his partner, Hank Morgan, fly whisper-craft. These are predominantly helicopters that can transform into jet planes. Even for 2000, these effects are so good it's still difficult to see they're CGI. The sequence where Adam tests his new remote control is filled with excitement, exhilaration, and humour. This is carried through to the characters action sequences, with the added emotions of tension and suspense.The major trouble comes to two of the main actors. Robert Duvall is so bland in his role as the doctor who implemented and conducts the cloning that a cardboard cut-out could have replaced him. Even when he knows his wife is dying and the reason behind her fate his emotions never alter. The other actor who could have been substituted was Tony Goldwyn who played Michael Drucker the billionaire financing the cloning. For the most part, he's okay it's just that he doesn't come across as powerful and aloof enough.The rest of the cast is spot on. Arnie is in Action-Arnie mode for this outing so if you enjoyed Eraser, Commando, The Last Stand, and the like then you'll be pleased with this. Michael Rooker is in his Don't Mess With Me persona, which he does so well because I wouldn't. Michael Rapaport is great as the unkempt and loyal best friend. I thought it was a shame that Sarah Wynter, who played the hard-woman Talia, didn't come across as hard enough. She's a major character in the film, but she was fading from my memory as the credits rolled.At the end of the day, this is an Arnie action film. This doesn't mean that you've seen it all before. Schwarzenegger is good at choosing a good story. So, even though his characters don't alter too much the stories do. There isn't a single movie he's starred in that I haven't enjoyed. I enjoyed this film when it came out. I enjoyed it when I watched it on video. And, when it came on the telly... you guessed it... I still found it highly enjoyable.If you want good-humoured kick-ass fun this is the film for you. I would recommend this flick to everyone, it's a truly wonderful waste of time.",The 6th Day
66,jhclues,He's Back!,5,27 November 2000,"Watching this movie is like visiting a Tomorrowland that's been through the looking glass.  Visually stunning, it virtually splashes a palette of color across the screen, and combined with thunderous sound it literally numbs the senses.  But the preeminent question that must be asked after seeing `The 6th Day' has to be, `Is bigger better?'  And the answer is, `Not really,' though you may get an argument on that account from director Roger Spottiswoode, who has made a truly BIG film, but left it somewhat hollow inside.  In fact, what he's created is something of a marvel of physical science; it's heavy without really having much substance.  Like a copy of a Monet, it's nice to look at, but there's not much value to it.  It does, however, pose some moral and philosophical questions which may, in the future, be of some significance.  To wit:  To Clone, or Not To Clone. 	The concept, while not entirely original, is interesting enough to make one take pause and reflect for a moment.  Unfortunately the script, written by Cormac and Marianne Wibberley, has some nice touches, but lacks the imagination required to really make a statement or put this one over to any large extent.  There's a number of obvious influences at play here, most prominently `Blade Runner,' `Star Wars' and `The Matrix,' with shades of `Blue Thunder' lurking around the corner; but this is not, however, a bad thing, mind you.  It's never a sin to incorporate the best of the best in a project of this magnitude.  And as I've stated previously, this is a `big' movie.  To Spottiswoode's credit, he keeps it all moving right along with little respite from the action, and when he does pause to take a breath, it's a welcome relief from the barrage of light and sound; the man does know how to put on a show.  If only he had given us something more to sink our teeth into.  He brushes up against some profound issues, but never really comes to grips with any of them.  But then again, this movie wasn't made to evoke philosophical discussions.  What he has given us is a movie that is bright, loud and actually very entertaining, albeit in a one dimensional way. 	As far as performances go, Arnold Schwarzenegger is, well...  Arnold.  He manages to flesh out his character of Adam Gibson, a man cloned without his consent or knowledge, to an acceptable degree, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot going on beneath the surface.  But Schwarzenegger does have an irrefutable screen presence and it's easy to like him.  He's an actor you can appreciate for what he does:  He gives you your money's worth for a couple of hours of entertainment.  Let's face it, there's only one Arnold, and it's a kick to watch him in action.  Also on hand is Robert Duvall (Dr. Graham Weir), who gives a subtle turn as the brains behind all of the DNA manipulation going on, and Tony Goldwyn (Drucker), as the man whose bottomless wealth makes it all possible in the first place. 	The supporting cast includes Michael Rapaport (Hank), Wendy Crewson (Natalie Gibson), Sarah Wynter (Talia) and Michael Rooker.  While far from being one of the most memorable movies of the year, or anywhere near the best that science fiction has to offer, `The 6th Day' is a stunning visual experience and, when all is said and done, will make you think a bit (without having to overwork too many brain cells).  Like a huge Fourth of July fireworks display, it is something to see, and Arnold's fans  will certainly appreciate it; and if you can just let yourself go with the flow for awhile, it's one you may actually enjoy.  It's all a part of the magic that is the movies.  I rate this one 5/10.",The 6th Day
67,CharltonBoy,This did nothing for me.,3,4 December 2001,"It has now got to the stage that Arnie can't even make a good action flick. He has tried comedy with awful results i.e: Twins and kindagarton cop and now his best genre is falling flat on it's face. That is axactly what The 6th day is... Flat. It has average special affects a stupid storyline and the usual emotionless acting from the big man himself. I found myself pottering around the house and fidgiting , wanting to do something else after about 45 minutes of this film. I felt totally uninterested in what was going on . It had the feel of a poor episode of the 6 million Dollar Man. As we now know the best films that Arnie do are the ones that he flexes his muscles and not his vocal chords such as T2 or Total Recal. Now that he is older and the Body isn't what it used to be maybe he should call it a day. 3 out of 10.",The 6th Day
68,ivo-cobra8,Very underrated awesome science-fiction action flick!,7,7 November 2015,"The 6th Day (2000) is a sci-fi action flick from Arnold Schwarzenegger. I saw this film in The theater after new year in 2001 when it was released by us in Slovenia. It was the first Schwarzenegger movie I ever saw in the theater before. Later in 2003 I went watching Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in summer August (2003). Those two film were the only Schwarzenegger films I have actually saw! And I love both of them, I even remember how this film was a huge hit in 2001, I kept seeing a VHS cover in the video rent store, I even saw the poster that time. So the film was a hit back than in 2001 when it was released and come to us in the cinema. What can I say it is one of my favorite Schwarzenegger action flicks. This film compared to Terminator: Genysys, Maggie, Sabotage and The Expendables 3 it is a much, much better improvement action futuristic flick than all the new movies I just counted Schwarzenegger did. This movie is awesome if you like near future action movies, than this is the movie for you. The 6th Day is good, I liked the action bits and the premise is actually quite interesting. It does follow the same old script tactics and the performances are... lets say uninspired. This was definitely a movie using Arnold's action star status for it's gain, pushing every little Arnold trait to the limit especially cheesy punch lines but this is a very enjoyable and cool action flick but it ain't T2. The movie works well for Arnold's action fans. A story premise that fits where technology was and is today. Cloning humans would represent a real danger but it also has moral issues to go with it. Robert Duvall's acting weight helps boost this movie along with Michael Rooker and Tony Goldwyn as the bad guys and this one is a winner. Arnold Schwarzenegger did a great job and he tried very hard acting in this one with not so much action as most Arnold films. Movie does a great job into deep details of cloning, too bad they wear having those high tech stuff. This film and has a good scenes, great action and the dialogue is funny. The scene when Arnold says when I told you to go screw yourself I didn't mean take it literally. This film is kind of science VS religion because the people who killed Tony Goldwyn's character religious people are against cloning because it is man playing God. I know the bad guys have their reasons for not wanting the business to be shut down if they are found out that they are clones, but in my opinion I think maybe they were afraid of death and want to use cloning as a way to cheat it and not die permanently, but that is just my opinion. I think the rest of the cast did a pretty good job, Michael Rapaport was awesome as Adam's friend, Sarah Wynter did a great job performance of her character Talia Elsworth as the bad guy and she acted very well. I remember Sarah Wynter from 24 (2001) TV series she play Kate Warner in Season 2. The second Season of 24 was always my favorite season of the show. She did made a brief cameo scene in Season 3 episode Day 3: 1:00 p.m.-2:00 p.m.. Gosh today I don't see her in any famous roles or in movies at all. Where did this world come to? from 2000 - 2011 years for me were awesome. Today movies are really awful made. I am glad I see this movie in theaters it is my favorite film and I love it to death! Director Roger Spottiswoode (Tomorrow Never Dies, Noriega) creates a world of the very near future in which cattle, fish, and even the family pet can be cloned. But cloning humans is illegal - that is until family man Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) comes home from work one day to find a clone has replaced him. Taken from his family and plunged into a sinister world he doesn't understand, Gibson must not only save himself from the assassins who must destroy him to protect their secret, but uncover who and what is behind the horrible things happening to him. The 6th Day is the story of Gibson's struggle to reclaim his life and his family.Director Roger Spottiswoode directed another film that I love 007 flick Tomorrow Never Dies another underrated Bond film and action adventure Shoot to Kill (1988) with Sidney Poitier.

70,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Attack of the Clones,4,15 December 2007,"""The Sixth Day"" is an example of when a big movie star gets so self-indulgent that they make a movie that has absolutely nothing new or interesting to offer, other than seeing that big movie star do what they are known best for doing. Arnold is know for kicking ass in big budget movies and this is just what he does here. Nothing more. The plot is a lame and uninspired version of ""Total Recall"" and it tries to top it with almost hilarious futility. There is even a scene where Arnold wakes up in a cab with no recollection of how he got there. Sound familiar? It should, since you have probably seen that in a better movie.Now, one can't blame this all on Arnold since the producers are likely to be just as much at fault. Take one of the opening sequences that involves two admitted cool helicopter/jet hybrids racing in a canyon with one on remote control and the other actually being flown by a pilot. It's a fun scene, but it offers nothing more than fancy special effects. I don't mind expansive special effects, but there is a clear difference when these effects are thoughtful and designed with purpose than when they are not. The expansive (and expensive) sets and effects of ""Total Recall"" all worked within the film to show you the futuristic world that the story takes place in. Here many things are shown off just because they look cool and the overall ""sci-fi"" world isn't really a sci-fi world at all. It is just our contemporary world with random sci-fi things thrown in like holograms, high-tech vehicles and gadgets. Though, in a very odd move, one of the film's main action scenes, a car chase, has just regular cars and a regular suburban setting. The only indicator of science fiction is that these vehicles are virtually indestructible as they plow through houses and take vehicle suspensions to new levels of abuse. However, in the end it just the same old thing reheated, re-glossed, and re-served on the same old movie screen.In other words, wholly uninteresting science fiction/action movie that barely scratches the surface of its interesting premise. It'll only entertain if taken as a no-brainer action flick, but there are so many of those around anyway. --- 4/10Rated PG-13 for violence. This is a real MPAA treat as we are treated to lasers severing body parts and neck breaking. A real high for violence in the PG-13 category. Ages 13+",The 6th Day
71,bellino-angelo2014,Underrated and among Schwarzenegger's very best,8,5 August 2021,"I had been curious for years about this movie despite I am not a huge Arnold Schwarzenegger fan because it's among his most famous despite it kinda bombed at the box office back in its day. And when I saw it, I found it very exciting in its own way.In a not too distant future is possible cloning animals but not humans. Adam Gibson (Schwarzenegger) is a pilot that with the help of Johnny Phoenix goes for a trip for taking the CEO of the cloning company Michael Drucker (Timothy Hutton) on a trip in the mountains. Some time pass and Drucker's clone (since the original was shot) is hosting a ceremony at the new cloning facility. In the meanwhile Adam goes home with a doll for her daughter since their dog couldn't be cloned and finds a clone of himself celebrating his birthday. Soon Drucker's henchmen (Terry Crews and Michael Rooker) come by and inform Adam that the 6th day law has been violated because an human is cloned. Soon a big chase ensue until Adam finally reaches Drucker in his facility and with the help of the clone they will end the conspiracy (I won't spoil how).While at times the movie seemed brain-dead I found it highly entertaining because Schwarzenegger is at his likeable best here. Action veteran Michael Rooker and Terry Crews in his debut are very good as Drucker's henchmen even tho they have more screen time than the villain himself, and even legendary actor Robert Duvall shines despite appearing for only 19 minutes (and he is killed by Drucker when he tried to unmask him). And I really loved the part towards the end when Adam and his clone try to defeat the final and deformed clone of Drucker and make the entire facility blow.In substance, a great action movie and a must see for its die hard fans and I think that they don't make movies like this anymore!",The 6th Day
72,kenandraf,Better than Total Recall!,10,18 November 2000,"Definitely much better than Total Recall becouse of the theme regarding man's mortality.I just realised something more about life becouse of this movie and it is that my material ""life"" is composed of my memories basically.The memory transfer and preservation span determines one's material existance.THE MEMORY not the body embodies my material identity.I thought about it hard as I walked out of the cinema after the movie played and it also dawned on me that the brain cells I had ten years ago are now dead and gone and yet I live on becouse the memories were transfered from the older brain cells to the new brain cells.I do not have the same material body for ever for older cells pass on information to the new cells.Some body parts faster or slower than the others.My very body is a continuing process of death and rebirth but becouse the memory transfer is smooth,I do not really realise my many deaths.It also turned my thoughts towards the very familliar transporter technologies of the sci-fi stories of Star Trek.Based on that technology if it does come about,one's body is basically killed(de-constructed) to be reasembled once again (re-constructed) with an exact copy of one's memories re-inserted.Scary thought huh?The movie delivers on all areas.Cinematography,effects,direction,etc.,everything perfect!The only area it is not perfect in is lack of overall originality.It was an amalgam of Total Recall,Bladerunner,Ghost In A Shell,Matrix,Terminator and Boys From Brazil.But even with this weakness,it still is one of the best movies ever made!Congratulations once again to Arnie!",The 6th Day
73,Movie-12,"One of the best action thrillers in years--great special effects, characters and story. **** (out of four)",9,9 January 2001,"THE 6TH DAY / (2000) **** (out of four) By Blake French:	Roger Spottiswoode's recent action film ""The 6th Day"" is of the best thrillers you will see this year, and possibly the next. Seldom do action pictures have as much thought, insight, and are this well written and developed. With a screenplay by Cormac Wibberley and Marianne Wibberley, the movie takes one of the most controversial current subjects, cloning, and applies it to a time when it may cause discern for public, the near future. This is a movie with ample prominence and proximity, and depending where you stand on the issue of cloning will determine whether or not we will side with the main character here. He is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, now forgiven for his last several bombs, ""Jingle all the Way,"" ""End of Days,"" and ""Batman and Robin."" If one thriller can make up for those three hideous productions, you know it must be very good...and it is.	Schwarzenegger stars as Adam Gibson, a middle-aged everyman who has a lovely wife, Natalie (Wendy Crewson), and a young, pretty daughter named Carla (Taylor Anne Reid). Adam and his friend, Hank (Michael Rapaport), are pilots for the Double X Charter Company, a helicopter touring service. While most of society has adapted to the advancements in technology, such as the ability to clone deceased pets and to own a realistic looking and behaving doll, Adam is pretty old-fashioned when it comes branch of knowledge. At least until one night when he returns home to find his family and friends celebrating his birthday with him already inside. Outside his house waits several agents, including Talia (Sarah Wynter), Robert (Michael Rooker), and Vincent (Terry Crews), who attempt to kill him. 	Adam and Hank were cloned by a multi-billion dollar food cloning company, Replacement Technologies. This corporation is run by an individual named Drucker (Tony Goldwyn), who supposedly used his cloning equipment to replenish the world's food supply. While human cloning is illegal, he and his chief scientist, Dr. Weir (Robert DuVall), are constantly cloning for various reasons. After they discover Adam escaped his assassins, they begin an all out scheme to destroy the evidence in which they have created. 
	The tedious measures the filmmakers take in development of the characters, situations, events, and motives are outstanding. We get to know the main characters. They are intriguing and the conflict is highly engrossing; even the antagonist's motives provoke thought. The film is engaging throughout because the subject and its execution are so relevant and controversial. ""The 6th Day"" does not feel like a high tech action film, although it is. But it also has a very authentic flavor because it uses the special effects to further the story, and the action sequences are all in context of the plot. 	About those action scenes and special effects, they do not distract from the movie's themes or story. Roger Spottiswoode, whose most poplar work consists of  ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" (1997) and ""Turner & Hooch,"" (1989), keeps the story fast-paced but finely focused. The futuristic material, so often overused in movies nowadays, is kept to a believable realm here. The film handles the material with delicacy; if the movie was to use too little, its subject matter would be unconvincing; if there was too much, then the film would become too far-fetched. Spottiswoode contrasts just the right amount, and blends the effects with the various character's personalities beautifully. 	What impresses me most of all about movies like ""The 6th Day"" is how the writers deny the urge to allow the special effects and action to take place of the passion in characters. In the year 2000, we received big waves in ""The Perfect Storm,"" big explosions in ""U-571,"" computer animated sequences in ""X-Men,"" and all sorts of special martial arts stunts in ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Legend of Drunken Master."" But what those movies were missing is depth and insight of the real world, and the movies that did contain heart, like ""The Perfect Storm,"" were contrived and shameless. With ""The 6th Day"" we have a movie that contains all the excitement and special effects, but within a story that is character-based and relevant to our times. This is one of the top ten movies released in the year 2000.",The 6th Day
74,FlickJunkie-2,Entertaining sci-fi action flick,7,30 March 2001,"As Arnold movies go, this one has a relatively good story.  It is somewhat reminiscent of `Total Recall' with its futuristic sci-fi bent, but it is better because it broaches some interesting ethical considerations regarding human cloning.  Of course, this IS an Arnold movie so it doesn't bother to weigh itself down with profundities, but it adds a little intellectual meat to his stock in trade, and that is a plus.  The script is a bit predictable with numerous tip-offs as to which is the real Adam Gibson and which is the clone.  However, there are enough interesting subplots to keep the viewer engaged.    Director Roger Spottiswoode (`Air America', `Tomorrow Never Dies') strikes a good balance between drama and action and paces the film well.  Arnold fans might find the action sequences a bit tame by comparison to some of his other films, but there is plenty to keep the average action junkie happy.The cast is generally solid.  Arnold is the same old Arnold, flexing his biceps and constantly flashing his well-spaced front teeth charmingly between action sequences.  His acting in this film is better than usual, giving his character both strength and vulnerability with a hint of tongue in cheek humor thrown in.  Michael Rapaport provides most of the comic relief in his bits with the virtual girlfriend.  Tony Goldwyn is hatefully nefarious as the manipulative magnate who runs a rogue cloning factory. Robert Duvall is excellent, as always, as the scientist with a conscience.Overall, this is an entertaining film with an interesting premise.  I rated it a 7/10.  The area of cloning is fertile ground on which to build a more serious story, but it serves as a good backdrop for this basic good v. evil action film.",The 6th Day

I wouldn't!",The 6th Day
76,cardsrock,Great premise with so-so execution,6,23 December 2020,"The 6th Day had the potential to be a classic Schwarzenegger sci-if action film in the realm of Total Recall or Terminator, if only it aspired that high. The B-movie vibe is hard to escape with generic action scenes and wooden dialogue. Arnie is his usual entertaining self though and does most of the heavy lifting (pun intended).

77,rdoubleoc,Still can't even believe they made a movie this good. Details matter.,10,11 April 2020,"When I saw this in theatres as a kid, I felt like Hollywood would keep delivering things like this, but currently it seems like the industry is struggling to provide new stories with the same amount of quality as before, like in this movie.The little details in this movie are what make it special. I'm sure there are some ""goofs,"" but for the most part every part of the story checks out and lines up with what's actually going on in the setting (like the woman having to pierce her ears again after dying). The only thing that doesn't check out is the fact that the clones don't know they're clones, but can easily check under their eyelids to see if they are (as in, they would probably realize they're clones sometime in life or at least wonder what the dots under their eyelids are).Other small things like the toy robot doll, virtual girlfriend, self driving cars, and all that cool stuff also make this movie as cool as it is. This was way ahead of it's time, but still holds up well even today because it was so well-made and produced.This movie will always be one of the greatest ever. In my mind, this is right up there with legendary movies like The Matrix.",The 6th Day
78,Aylmer,"""I don't wanna be your mommy!""",5,17 November 2021,"The late 90's and early 00's felt to me like a clear nadir in cinema history. Gone were the days of 80's and 90's stunt-oriented action without the soulless sheen of CGI layered onto every new movie. It was the time period that gave us the rise of conveyor belt low budget U. S.-Canadian co-productions with the same assembly line group of Vancouver actors, including the rise of Uwe Boll, and similarly cut-and-paste films from tax shelter production companies / scams such as Franchise pictures. You were assured to have another low-brow crowd-pleaser in theaters every week, but crowds were starting to grow weary of these increasingly cynical glossy films with low-effort stories. In the midst of this slow spiral into junk-food entertainment came a chance for Arnold to revisit familiar sci-fi memory-theft territory as well as get to play multiple roles in the way Van Damme was already turning into an established science.This movie comes off as so desperate to be liked, that it's hard not to toss it a little sympathy. There's so much attempt to gin up interest with NATURAL BORN KILLERS style MTv editing and lots of dutch angles and flashy split-screen effects. Crisp and dynamic camera movements showcase the bright and dynamic futuristic color pallet. All this pales in comparison to what Paul Verhoeven and Jost Vacano were able to accomplish 10 years earlier with Schwarzenegger's other big sci fi action adventure, TOTAL RECALL, a film that actually made you feel like you were stepping into another world with a sense of wonder.Compared to RECALL, 6TH DAY, comes off as that untalented younger brother desperately vying for attention. There's plenty of interesting ideas here and a pretty good cast. Unfortunately the film falters right out of the gate by not really doing much with any of its potential. A lot of the cool ideas get thrown away immediately in favor of bland action scenes which lose all credibility considering Schwarzenegger is presented as a regular-guy Mr. Nice Guy helicopter pilot. Suddenly when push comes to shove, he's an invincible and fully agile sprinter, able to outwit, out-run, out-shoot, and out-McGuyver a bevy of incompetent villains. This all could have worked earlier in Arnie's career when he was in ultimate badass mode, but between this film and COLLATERAL DAMAGE, he just seemed to be getting ungainly, awkward, and subtly impatient as though he is just here for the money. At this time he was more like a parody of himself and no longer like the all-American/Germanic hero of days past.Speaking of awkward, the frequent attempts to show Arnie's family life come off as some of the least believable of his career. His wife and daughter have practically no defining characteristics of their own considering how much we see them. Practically nothing emotional lands and there's this strange air of artificial and insincere goofiness in a film that purports to intelligently tackle some tricky subjects. The PG-13 rating certainly doesn't do any favors, lowering the brow of this already simian script even further to make it more kid-friendly. My guilty-favorite aspect of the film has to be the talking Sim-Pal Cindy doll, which is hilariously designed to look as creepy as possible. It's obvious the makers were copying the uncanny valley of Johnny Cab in TOTAL RECALL (with a touch of Chucky), but decide to give this concoction an inordinate amount of attention. She seems to be vaguely aware of what's going on, which makes things hilarious when the bad guys have her along for the ride in their car and she just mindlessly spouts platitudes of friendship to them as they speed along. The filmmakers obviously had it out for her though as she ends up taking on a nearly ""Simpsons""-episode level of sadistic punishment. I'm surprised they didn't just go a little further and end with a money shot of several cars running over her head while she screams in pain.So that sums up this movie in a nutshell; it just never quite goes far enough. It's tacky but never really funny, it's intriguing without being profound, and it's action-oriented without having an ounce of tension. Still for whatever reason, I have to revisit this film every few years as the very definition of guilty pleasure. I swear it's totally not just to see the creepy doll screaming and crying as it takes abuse. Okay, maybe it is.",The 6th Day

80,FilmFanInTheHouse,Decent Futuristic Action Movie,7,6 April 2007,"The 6th Day starring Arnold Schwarzenegger is a movie based around the year 2015, where cloning humans is illegal, whilst pet cloning is acceptable. The story is about Arnold's character, Adam Gibson discovers that a identical clone of himself in his home with the family. Next up, is a chance through the city to find out why he is trying to be killed, and find out the truth behind the cloning.Having it set not too far in the future, does give an idea of what the future might be like. They haven't gone over the top. Cars still have wheels in this film. All the improved technology in the film are all very believable, and with cloning already appearing in the real world in some form, make it even more interesting. Whilst saying that, i must also add, that the special effects are very impressive here. Even the new versions of the helicopters look amazing zooming through the air.The film isn't packed with action, as there is also a good mystery story in there, which also keeps you wondering towards the end, and gives you a surprising conclusion. The action which is in place is also fun to watch, with the highlight probably the car chase along the city.The action is also impressive, and Arnold Schwarzenegger really do act as if there is another version of him in the room.

It has action, special effects, an intriguing story, and Arnold Schwarzenegger back in full form. It's been a while since I've seen a good Schwarzenegger movie, and ""The 6th Day"" didn't disappoint me. I'll admit it's not a great Schwarzenegger film like ""Total Recall"", ""Terminator 2"", and ""True Lies"", but it's a good one. ""The 6th Day"" stars Schwarzenegger as a helicopter pilot who finds out one night that he's been cloned. He tries to get to the bottom of this, but ends up being pursued by the corporation who cloned him. What follows is some well-staged action scenes and special effect sequences that are quite impressive (those visual effect helicopters in the movie we're cool). The story is well-written, and Schwarzenegger is very good in his role here. ""The 6th Day"" is not classic sci-fi, but it's well made and entertaining. *** (out of four)",The 6th Day

83,AKS-6,Quite good actually,6,16 May 2001,"The 6th Day is a typical late 80s-early 90s type of action flick. Better special/visual effects perhaps, but the script might as well have been written in 1990. The 6th Day not only features character actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, it seems that it has been inspired by (and borrowed from) Arnie-flick Total Recall. The two films are very much alike.The 6th Day was, I have to say, very entertaining. It was also about ten times as good as I expected. I had great fun watching this movie. So, if you don't have any expectations -- and feel kind of nostalgic -- then you should rent this movie and you will probably not be disappointed. (6/10)",The 6th Day

The sole purpose of this movie is entertaining its audience.  After viewing the film, I'm pleased to say that I was highly entertained.  Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a man who has been cloned.  We tag along with Arnold on his journey to find out why he's been cloned, and why he's being hunted by Michael Rooker and his group of laser toting assassins.  What's unique to this movie is the fact that it's set in the not to distant future.  Some of the technology that is shown in the film, may become reality within the next ten to twenty years.  Cars that drive themselves, appliances that inform you when you're in need of milk and cloning procedures that would've only been considered science fiction twenty years ago.  The action set pieces are exciting and there is some good humor in the film.  Particularly one very funny sequence that involves a doll called a Sim-Pal.  Arnold has his one liners to throw around, and it's good to see him back in form.  He's been absent from films like this for too long.  Another good thing about the movie is the rating. The PG-13 rating allows just about everyone to enjoy this movie.  There are a few choice words here and there, and some people getting blasted by lasers, but that's about it.

86,Rammstein-2,Arnie might be back,6,4 December 2000,"Longing for some Schwartzenegger action, the kind only the King can provide, I had high hopes for this film. But long gone are the days of the very climax of action flicks - we have yet to see the likes of ""Terminator 2"", ""True Lies"" and ""Total Recall"". But ""The 6th Day"" has some similarities with the latter: Arnie transforms from the ordinary suburban home-owner to a muscle-bound bulldozer in just a few minutes (and pretty much without any effort); his life has changed in a fundamental way, making him think about his own existence and what is real; the resolve with which he fights is at Arnies normal level: the world will end before Arnold.""The 6th Day"" is well crafted, successfully building a world in the near future that doesn't seem so extreme. The helicopters are not so extreme as one could think - there have been plans for that kind of aircraft for more than 20 years - and the life in the near future is probably pretty much like it will be: as usual, but with cooler cars, niftier clothes and more gadgets.The story is actually pretty good, for once, not that I think it raises any questions concerning cloning that we aren't already aware of (except maybe for the possibility of reviving household pets), but it makes sense most of the time. What the film lacks, though, is suspense. There is not one nerve-wracking moment in this film, and the action itself is pretty lame. The balance between story and action has been checked for once. As for fun, well... there are some things to laugh at, especially the hologram girlfriend (who undoes zippers, no less) and the great timing when Arnold+Arnold go: ""Cool.""But this film is not, I repeat not, a good ol' classic action flick, and I am sad to say that I think that those days are gone.

 this film is not only an A grade movie but it's the best movie in years from this genre.
 I think it's even better than Arnold's masterpiece total recall.
 the reason is not only that it had a lot of action a great plot and twists but it's also brought the dilemma of where the human race is going if those clone experiments become reality in our lives.
 cloning is already happening today and this film foretold that some 20 years ago. it's a film which foretold the near future and it's considered an average film ? really ? this film should be re-released now and gross like a billion dollars. morals....all are tested in this film. personally I love all of Arnold's films but if I had to choose ONE film from him to have I would pick this one without a further thinking. one of the few films that gets from me not just an A grade but an A ++++++",The 6th Day

Going into it as an ""Arnold Schwartzenegger"" film, I was very pleasantly surprised to find this a genuine contemplation of the potential implications of human cloning, as well as being a truly entertaining Sci-Fi film with elements of drama, humor and pathos.  Although it wasn't truly ""original"" in the usual definition (elements from other movies were present), the screenplay was highly original in the way these elements were put together.Personally, I enjoyed the unusual 'cinematographic devices' used to represent memories, although some may find these annoying, and I didn't find this film depressing in the slightest.  Fine filmmaking, and I didn't have to turn my brain off... there were some predictable elements (""the thumb"" as an example), but overall the movie threw some surprises at me that I wasn't expecting (some may, but I don't consciously try to think ahead while watching a movie).  The pacing, although unusual at some points, felt right in this film.I do think the film might have been better with a different lead, Arnold was redundant in a sense here.  Someone ""more articulate"" maybe, but still he was OK here... in fact, a pleasant surprise.I recommend this film to both action-adventure and sci-fi fans, and give it a solid 8/10.

Mistakes are made and Adam Gibson (Arnie) gets a clone made of him while he is still alive and he sees himself and has to get to the bottom of it.This movie was full of high tech visions of our supposed not so distant future, but all the movie had was millions of dollars wasted on bad CGI effects and little action.

The movie isn't really science fiction as most people classify it. The technologies are not here yet, but I don't see it as fantastic and out of this world.

Am I weird, or are they all just wrong? Well, I love this movie, and yes, you are all wrong.Many action stars have a certain kind of movie that they have to have on their resume. Either a Die Hard (1988) rip-off, or a film in which they co-star with themselves and play a dual role. This is the latter for Arnold.This underrated sci-fi action movie features Arnold playing two roles, Terry Crews' first film performance, awesome action scenes, one of the coolest Arnold one-liners, and a weird doll.The premise isn't exactly high-concept science fiction in comparison with other sci-fi movies, but it's perfectly engaging.The action sequences are great and they are worthy of an Arnie film. The car chase is legit, the parking garage shootout is awesome, the final shootout in the building is awesome too along with some other small scenes. The violence is surprisingly graphic and visceral for a PG-13, and that, along with some brief nudity and an f-bomb, easily push this into R-rated territory, and it pushes the boundaries of the PG-13 rating. I mean, a dude's foot gets severed by a laser blast.Arnold punches himself in the face, and later he teams up with himself and they shoot bad guys together. Also villains are killed and cloned, which manages to be a cheaply creative plot device allowing the same actors to come back.Arnold, Michael Rooker, and Terry Crews are all in one movie. It's awesome, and one of the best 2000s action movies. It only looks mediocre when compared to Total Recall (1990), but it is definitely a worthy Arnold vehicle.",The 6th Day

With a bit more effort this could have been in much the same league as Total Recall; indeed there is much about TSD which, intentionally I think, sets about to remind the viewer about that classic, but this is very much a pale imitation.The problem is that the main premise in presented in a confusing and incoherent way. There seems to be an element of consciousness transference about the cloning process. Although this is not usual with any known cloning process, it could be made to work if it were consistently applied. But it isn't. Some characters seem to be the same person reborn in a fresh body even though they clearly died (and make light of their deaths in not very convincing comedy) while others, such as Schwarzenegger and the baddie can exist in two bodies at the same time. How does this work exactly?

96,mgruebel,Underrated late-period Arnold,7,14 February 2015,"Released in 2000, ""The Sixth Day"" does not quite hearken back to Schwarzenegger's glory days of Terminator 2, Predator and the like, but it is a far cry above other late period work like ""Last Action Hero."" In my opinion this breezy action flick deserves better than a 5.9 on IMDb, and I give it a 7: worth seeing more than once, but not in the 8-10 great movies category.In the film, Arnold accidentally gets cloned by a business magnate due to a mix-up, and the magnate's henchmen (and women, Sarah Wynter is a great henchwoman) relentlessly pursue him to wipe out the duplicate that could give away their illegal human cloning scheme. As the film progresses, you wonder: who is the clone, and the 'real' person? Does it make a difference? Of course, there's a happy ending for Arnold - and his clone, while the bad guys get dismembered, necks broken, consumed in explosions that tear skyscrapers apart, and all the usual good stuff in Arnie action flicks.The best part of this film is its script. Perhaps too intricate for some, it is a lovingly written action script that really makes an effort not to have too many plot holes. Even stuff that seems unimportant or a plot hole at first, turns out to be cleverly crafted. Some examples:The 'real' Arnold has a nick from shaving, which his friend uses to ID the 'real' one. But later we learn the cloners have copied that, too. So who is real?In passing on the phone, evil magnate Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) mentions ""Get me the Speaker (of the house) on the phone."" It turns out much later in the film that he invited the Speaker to a gala where he talks about cloning saving cancerous children; the speaker has a son with cancer, and becomes a sucker for making cloning legal.Likewise, Drucker explains that brains cannot yet be cloned without support from the whole body during cell growth, getting a major pothole out of the way. Likewise, a lot of care is taken to explain the medical 'science' just enough to close plot holes, but not so much that it becomes fake. They even get away pretty well with the idea that clones can be grown from 'unformed' templates by gene infusion to differentiate them within hours. (After all, the plot has to keep moving, and we can't wait for 30 years for the clone of a dead 30 year-old.)The script and production team also hit the nail on the head with the 'near future' background material: a self-driving car awfully like a Google car, styled slightly futuristically, but just as you might expect something in the year 20XX to look. Taxis that are paid by fingerprint (Apple Pay, anyone). Jet-helicopters; malls with gigantic monorails to move people; super- realistic dolls; refrigerators that order milk when it runs out, but in a normal-looking house. And best, the Re-pet (re-peat, get it?) pet stores that clone your beloved dog or cat so your kids don't suffer anguish when the old dog goes to heaven. The store chain serves as a foil for a bit of bioethics and cloning philosophy. Basically, the world in this movie feels very much like 20XX USA could feel, as opposed to the often overblown futurism in 'near-future' action flicks.But of course, this IS an action flick, so don't expect deep philosophy here. It moves along fast through a complex but quite self-consistent plot, and an intelligent action fan will enjoy this movie, and the fact that (s)he will have to search just a little harder than usual to find the unavoidable plot holes. If the scriptwriters make me work at it a little bit (and even realize that what I thought is a hole is actually consistent on careful examination!), I am happy.This is a 7/10 on many levels, for above average complexity, above average consistency, and plenty of action - although the action in this one is pretty mundane. What can I say, more mundane action is actually more realistic, and this is one of the more realistic action films of the 2000s, if there is such a thing as a realistic action film.

99,Starbuck-13,"Simple, but impressive.",7,20 December 2000,"This film was a surprise because it was very thought-provoking - for an action movie.The beginning - a star quaterback getting severely injured - really struck a nerve because I am a big sports fan. And so, the movie started with a bang and though the plot was easy to foresee, it did not fail to impress - and to intimidate. The fact that cloning is no longer science fiction adds a lot to this anxiety, and I sat in the theater kind of uneasy because I never though about the implications cloning might have on our lives someday (""sooner than you think"", as the film makes us believe).Schwarzenegger does his hero routine and the action plot is business as usual - but the topic of the movie makes this one a whole lot better than most of its predecessors. The film left me with the question: When does life end? Do I live on when I am cloned after my death? My answer is no, my existence ends and another one takes over my place - a carbon copy like me, but still not me.",The 6th Day

My God, where can I start with? The story, actors, sets everything is around Scwarzenegger and honestly, I can't find anything good about him. Bad acting, null charisma and worst of all, they constantly want to make him excuse  like an  American citizen, with one of the worst accents ever, this is NOTHING LESS THAN RIDICULOUS. What is left behind are supporting actors expecting to `shine' with a great golden lead (but couldn't) some mediocre special effects (some of them aren't consistent with the background in the helicopter ride, it is flying really low above a river and there is no water motion on it-), a promising storyline, an enjoyable score (by the master Trevor Rabin) and. That's all (oh a regular production design and an interesting cinematography, and the idea of seeing how much times have we been cloned are the number of spots you have inside your lower eyelid) For an issue like this, which is very present nowadays we were expecting for a better vehicle of information. The audience is still waiting for a better treatment on the issue, and please, don't throw Schwarzenegger into one of these again. 5 negative points to Arnold Schwarzenegger and five positive to the rest, after all nothing more than a 5/10.",The 6th Day

104,Minus_The_Beer,Totally Recalled,6,25 June 2016,"Before he served the state of California as The Governator, Arnold was both the Terminator and the Terminated, he hunted Predators and Sharon Stone, battled Satan and school children and through the miracle of science and corny 90s Ivan Reitman productions, managed to give birth. But in ""The 6th Day"" he faces a foe so evil and frightening that only a Republican can clobber it to death: Science!Taking place in an awkward future where tobacco and alcohol are outlawed but yet an extremely violent version of the NFL dubbed XFL thrives (this was a real thing for about 15 minutes, in case you aren't old enough to remember), ""The 6th Day"" tells the story of a family man and choppah pilot who has just about the most fulfilling life one could imagine. Unfortunately, the death of a family pet leads him down an unfortunate path where he finds himself being cuckolded by himself while Terry Crews, Henry Rooker and a couple of Blade Runner rejects hunt him down. Turns out they work for Evil Bob Saget (who looks more like Blob Saget during the film's climax), an evil scientist who wants to advance medicine and, well, exploit it as well.Director Roger Spottiswoode's film is nothing if not serviceable action fodder. Truth be told, the action hero genre was pretty tired by the time this film rolled around in 2000, and it shows. Though offering more entertainment for your buck than Arnold's Y2k bugged ""End Of Days"" or the uncomfortable pre-9/11 terrorist romp, ""Collateral Damage,"" the movie's ambition isn't fully realized in its execution. Along the mostly fast-paced and admittedly entertaining ride, the audience -- along with Arnold himself -- stumble over bone-headed clichés, recycled plot points and one-note characters. The action is standard fare, bordering on numbing (but saved by an outstanding hilarious sequence involving a ""real doll"" named Cindy). In the end, the movie is nowhere near as intelligent or as thought-provoking as its premise promises, but as far as wannabe Philip K. Dick fodder goes, you could do much worse.Still holding out for that sequel, ""The 7th Day: Day of Rest,"" wherein Arnold sits with his family on Sunday, knocks back a few brews and binges on some good ol' 'Murican XFL.",The 6th Day

106,talllwoood13,very well made,7,21 October 2021,"I usually hate sci-fi movies. However this is far from some.star wars knock off. No this can be believed without any substances. What surprised me was how unique the concept was compared to a lot of the other movies I have seen the past few months.This is a society where cloning humans has been banned and it's shot in the near future. Not some silly The Jetsons sort of setup where it's flying cars and all. How this movie deals with cloning in general is fantastic. It tackles stuff such as loss of pets, curing terminally ill people and even tries its best to solve world hunger with such concepts because you know as well as I GMO free and organic isn't going to save the world. I really think this movie has aged well minus the at times cheesy special effects. Perhaps the poster for the movie is what made it not sell or do as well as it should have though it wasn't a bomb.One of the creepiest things though is the Simpal dolls. It's like horror movie material.The film is so simple on paper to describe. It's Arnold's birthday, he chooses not to fly.some billionaire up this mountain. Instead his friend who is an actor who is in like 100 movies to brief cameos such as GTA 3 where he voiced Joey Leone and of course that awful role where he was in Prison Break the 4th season where they all become secret agents it seems. So someone decides to shoot the billionaire and everyone on the chopper and then decides to clone them. The way they do it is quite brilliant where you wonder if he really is the clone. I'm just glad unlike Universal Soldier where it's not even worth watching anything past 1 they never made sequels to this movie.There is all sorts of technology even today 20 years after watching this I'd love to see. Biometric paying system so people can't scam public transit systems to taking a picture of someones brain which would make interrogation pointless. It was even a nice touch there is bible nuts who are against cloning pets.The way they did the assassins to kill the second arnold was quite intelligent but when you look under their eyelids what would happen if they cloned someone more than 10 times was the first thing I thought. I love the digital girlfriends it is far less sad than worrying how many followers or subscribers we have on social media. Plus smoking is illegal. I hope it's all types of smoking.The movie is a bit long I found, how they make the bad guy ""bad"" was actually quite genius. Though I feel the actor shouldn't have looked like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates love child and instead someone more menacing than the guy who will fix your computer when it's having troubles in the IT department of an office. The DNA defects and the other forms of control Drucker tries to add are brilliant. How Drucker ends up with an 80 something percent clone of himself looks like the father in everyone loves raymond the old one who had his way with the mask from the goosebumps first movie.The casting worked, most of them could act. Arnold even got to do some of his iconic screams. But besides the movie being a bit too long that is all I can really think that I didn't care for just the bad guy was poorly cast and the pacing 3/4 of the way in the movie I can see all the millennials in the audience texting.",The 6th Day
107,Asteri-Atypical,Worth Renting,4,29 July 2001,"I have some mixed feelings about this film but overall I found it enjoyable.Some of the important questions and answers would be:Was it enjoyable to watch?  Yes, overall.  There was enough of an interesting story and decent action and effects to keep one entertained.Was it all it could be?  Definitely not.  While the story addressed some interesting ideas and had enough story to be interesting, it didn't delve into quite the imagination it easily could have.  While it was certainly cute to see a vision of the future, most aspects were hardly original.  It was FUN to see a film carry forth most modern trends to the near future but the lack of innovations was also a weakness.  This film had the potential to delve deeply into the problem which WILL face us about cloning:  ""what do we DO about it, morally"", but sadly this was only ONE instance of some of the things which COULD happen.  I would have liked to have seen more of the philosophy.Ironically I saw a comment saying it was hard to believe in this future world.  I had to laugh at that.  While the science behind the cloning was a long stretch, most of this future world came straight from extrapolating current trends.  Like it or not, most of this is where we're headed!Was it better than most films today?  Yes.  Too many action pseudo-scifi films are for the brain dead.  This film at least dared to be interesting.I thought the ending was the weakest part (spoiler here).  It boiled down to ""kill the bad guys, blow up their stronghold and all is well"".  I would liked to have seen at least some surprising twists, to see society faced with this information and the drama which would ensue, or to truly be faced with the philosophical ramifications of the two Adams.  I really expected a twist at the end like the ""real"" Adam, whom we assumed was the original (since 'Adam 2' had the spot in the eyelid), would see TWO spots under his eyelid!  But since he wasn't the one who learned what that meant, he would dismiss it and go on, leaving us to wonder what happened.  That, or the wife and/or daughter finding the eyelid dot, insinuating THEY were clones (having been switched while in custody as a double cross)! On a different note, it was nice to finally see a blonde in a movie do something interesting to her hair instead of women of great natural beauty dying to BECOME blonde!  Even if she was a muderous fiend :-)I was rather disappointed there were not more special features on the DVD, especially **CUT SCENES**.  Most movies seem to have EXCELLENT scenes cut.

WARNING! CLONED SPOILERS!Props are very nice, as is the futuristic gizmos. I expected to see more of Arnold's trade mark action, so was disappointed at the lack of action in this flick. The plot is not riveting, but holds your attention as you try to figure out which Arnold is the real one. There are some touching moments (the genetic engineer's wife telling him she wants to die and doesn't want to be cloned again). An interesting gimic is the big corp's alteration of DNA that causes cloned clients to die in 5 years so clients are forced to spend big money to keep re cloning themselves.CONCLUSION?

I decide to watch this movie after I read some of the reviews on IMDB and heard great things about it. It was good but not as good as I expected. The plot seemed too simple and straight forward, the acting seemed a little to simple. I think Arnold didn't act very well considering he was supposed to have just lost his family and he did seem upset but more like he just lost his wallet or dented his car type of upset. The action sequences were pretty good and the besides a few flaws this movie was still pretty solid and fun to watch. Oh, one thing I definitely did not like was the flashes of the movie when the cut from scene to scene, boy did that give me a headache. My eyes were sore by the end of the movie. 7 out of 10. Classic Arnold but still needed work.",The 6th Day
114,ingemar-4,Remarkably good with a few flaws,7,5 January 2011,"I was pleasantly surprised with how good the not very favorably reviewed 6th day was. It delivered in several ways:It has the expected action, stunts, effects.It has the expected one-liners and humor.Acting is generally perfectly adequate for the purpose. Rather, it must be pretty good when I never was disturbed by any bad acting.It is nicely futuristic in a near-future fashion with many perfectly or partially believable ideas (and some that we don't quite believe in, but hey, if we accept hyperspace travel then we can accept this).It has a message that actually keeps us thinking after leaving the movie. The cloning problem is considered from many points of view (not only as the bad guy's evil plan). How far can we heal, how far can we preserve life, when does it become an ethical problem, when will it clash with religion?That is quite impressive if you ask me.However, sometimes it fails on two points: Predictability and suspense. Some scenes, especially involving the bad guy, are so embarrassingly predictable that it makes me wish they could have skipped some clichés just for once. And the movie misses great suspense opportunities on several occasions. I won't tell you how, who or when, but when a guy is assassinated, it should not happen just out of the blue, but we should be led into the situation slowly (for example from the assassin's point of view) so we get the chance to worry about it. That opportunity is missed at least twice, when the movie jumps straight into the kill, giving us momentary cheap shock instead of thrill. Compare it to the killing in, for example, Predator (one of the most excellent Arnold movies). Most kills by the Predator don't come out of the blue, we are warned, and it adds suspense and thrill.Those flaws push the movie down from the top marks, but I still rank it pretty high for the points mentioned above. Quite entertaining and even interesting too, which makes it one of the better Arnold movies. Recommended!",The 6th Day
115,Mario64,An interesting idea that falls short,5,22 September 2002,"The Sixth Day, a movie about cloning, action and more cloning, is a movie that takes an interesting idea, and really doesn't do what it really could of done with it. I liked the debate about cloning stuff, it's an intrigueing issue. The story is basicly a man finds out that he has been cloned, and people try to kill him because of it. There are quite a few rediculous aspects about this movie's plotline, the most notable one being how can these ""bad"" guys continue to clone one person after another where there's the Sixth Day violation that carries this fourty year prison sentance? The script doesn't really have many strong aspects, as most character are just flat, and Arnold's character lacks the strenth and motivation he has had in many of his previous action films. As for the action scenes, they're okay but not that great. The most similar Arnold movie that you can compare this to is Total Recall which was a much more thrilling and fun sci-fi action movie. This movie, like other recent Arnold flicks, isn't bad but doesn't have enough for you to call it a good action movie. I give it a 5 out of 10.",The 6th Day
116,el_monty_BCN,Jolly good fun,8,10 January 2001,"MILD SPOILERSI'll tell you what, when I went to see this, I really wasn't expecting much. As an Arnie fan from the old ""I'll Be Back"" days, I couldn't miss it, but judging from the dreadful choices he has made since ""Crusade"" fell through, and from the fact that Roger ""Stop or My Mum Will Shoot"" Spottiswoode was at the helm, frankly this had little going for it.And what do you know, I had the most fun I've had with an Arnie movie since his last teaming with the infallible King Cameron, ""True Lies"". OK, so some plot points were a bit too absurdly convoluted and contrived. So what, can I have a show of hands of people who can make sense of every detail in any Bond movie, please? It didn't matter to me. I just thought it was like a nice riff on T2, with poor Arnie facing villains that could not be killed because they kept regenerating. As expected, rent-a-director Spottiswoode fails to give it the edge that directors with more personality, like Verhoeven or Cameron, would have given to it, but still the story has enough meat to keep you entertained and the effects, while nothing special, do the job. And last but not least, Michael Rapaport makes a great comic sidekick, like Tom Arnold before him. Here's hoping that this film will mark the Austrian oak's return to form!",The 6th Day

The SIXTH DAY is a fun action movie, but it's also an insightful sci-fi story. Arnold is a normal guy who accidentally gets cloned and now has the evil Drucker corp. trying to kill him.

If Blake reads this: Take away the cloning thing, and you have a normal action film with little point.For one thing, my brother (Pete, or Preston) said it had a twist at the end. My brother guessed it. And he was RIGHT. (Spoiler: I mean, come on, having the Arnold we know be the clone? That is weaker than Gone in Sixty Seconds' twist.) Also, while not really anything special:If it takes place in the future that is sooner than we might think, it should happen soon. (My guess: Next Sunday, AD.)The guns are blaster rip-offs from ""Star Wars."" (The only difference is that these are blue. And look like lightsaber blades.)Finally: Cloning people?

119,Sorpse,Refreshingly good watch,8,3 November 2012,"yeah i was very happy with how this movie turned out. I was a little sceptical going into it but luckily it was surprisingly good. Sure it felt a bit like total recall...you know cloning and erasing or creating memories both raise similar moral issues and the plot evoked similar feelings in not really knowing who's who and what is real. Aside from those two things the movie did however manage to gain its own identity. instead of being on mars and having crazy mutants this one is set on earth and focuses more on what things might look like in the future. All the futuristic technology, be it holograms, laser guns, or full size remote control/transforming helicopters are what really makes this movie interesting and stand out. The only real negative i can give to this movie is that at some moments it was very obvious that they were pushing for a pg-13 rating. There was only one f bomb and arnold later quotes himself but replaces said f bomb with a more socially acceptable word...screw. The cast was great im a big fan of michael rapaport and michael rooker, as well as the big black guy who i cant remember his name but plays in a lot of comedies. Another plus was how much thought went into the plot and morality issues. They played around a lot with the what ifs of cloning and there were plenty of different clever scenarios surrounding this basis. And lastly you get some great one liners we have all come to expect from arnie and this movie has some of the best of them. I'll leave you with a few of my favourites and if you have not yet seen this movie then stop reading now. ""You should go clone yourself while your still alive"" ""why so i can see things from your perspective?"" ""no, so you can go f@#$ yourself"". ahahaha that one was the best and another was when arnold walks in the room and is acknowledged by the villain and says ""i wish i could say the one and only"". i can tell that they put a lot of thought and effort into this movie and lines like these show that they also had a lot of fun with it. great movie.",The 6th Day

Its theme is cloning, and amongst the well-paced and well-executed action sequences the film does bring up some deep existential and ethical issues. It is an intelligent film (something I had not thought synonymous with Arnie at that time). It is one of his best performances.

Despite the big action sequences, the whole film just lacks that firepower that makes Arnies other films such a joy to watch. The plot seems to be a cross between Total Recall and The Matrix and Schwarzeneggers acting is diabolical.

I also enjoyed many of the Technological concepts...self driving cars, refrigerators with screens that order food, holograms for advertising...it is all very forward thinking so it is beyond a ""dated"" film. It feels very relevant to today as we are now moving INTO this era of Biotech, AI, self driving vehicles etc. Great set designs, costumes and action. A welcome surprise that I had somehow missed! I would recommend for a good fun movie...which can lead to some interesting conversation....",The 6th Day
131,dimadick,It could have been a masterpiece but...,6,23 June 2001,"This film is interesting.Gives us all a look at the possible pros and cons of cloning.It has at least two interesting characters(The cloning doctor and the businessman).Arnold prooves he can act well when it comes to drama.The film is much better than Total Recall(one of Arnie's dumbest),Matrix and other sci-fis. Duvall has an excelent role.The ethic doctor who clones animals of many species(homo Sapiens included.)He has morality,seems to have dreams about the future,he clones them so that they might leave longer.He should be the star of this film. His employer dreams of being immortal.He has low morals but actualy offers some continument of life to many animals(including Homo Sapiens). His speech when he asks how can we explain to the relatives of a dying child that they can't even have him as a clone though the means exist is great and needs deep thinking to realy comprehend(think of your own loveones when doing it). Arnold has some drama sceans which are great.That means when discussing morality. Up till now I say why I liked this movie.Now time to say what makes me not want to see it again.First of all it's title:""6th Day"" which refers to the Genesis book of the Bible.I have studied it along with most other books of the bible.It is is just a Jewish version of mythology not different to others mythologies which also present us the origins of human kind according to different religious beliefs.The god of the bible is not unique.The true origin of man kind can only be understood if we study biology and evolution,not religion.The evolution process and that Homo Sapiens is an animal originating from other primates is ignored here.The fact that the soul is only a religious belief is also forgotten here. The fundamentalists throught the movie seem dangerous.They don't actually think.They want death to be perminent,thats why they don't want clonings,they kill in the name of a god,convinced that clones are not humans.This movie should examine them more carefully.I can't think of a better example of how religious beliefs threatened human civilisation over the centuries.Both the fundamentalists and the ""6th Day"" law are the scariest parts of this movie. This movie has too much sceanes of shooting and blowing things up instead of having philosophical debates.If somebody wants to see movies without scenarios let him rent Terminator II and start making better films. If it was more philosophical and less action and religious it could have been a masterpiece.At least it's Arnie's second good role after Conan the barbarian.",The 6th Day
132,gwest-58160,Not Arnie's best!,4,18 September 2018,"Not Arnie's best! Kind of watchable but also kind of bad. The helicopter flying scene with all the cheesiness and bad cgi was cringeworthy. It set the standard for the rest of the film. Won't ever watch again. Not ""so bad it's good"", just so bad it's still bad.

The 6th Day, (besides being a failed action movie) contains heavy profanity, nudity, strong violence (including a scene where a guy gets his leg shot off) but somehow got a PG-13 rating.

135,Krog__,Only Girlie Men Won't Like This Film,4,20 August 2004,"Well, and most other people too, but that's beside the point.Gov. Schwarzenegger plays a pilot who gets cloned by some shady characters. The clone gets put in his place... and then his best friend, a fellow pilot, dies. Or maybe the order is reversed. I don't remember. Sort of like the rest of this movie...Medium-grade action fills up this cliched movie telling about the dangers of cloning, only not telling about the dangers of cloning. I hope Arnold got paid a lot of money to be in this because otherwise, it was SO not worth it. Don't see it, really, but at the same time, it's far from the worst film I've ever seen.

""Have a nice flight, little girl.""What I miss in this movie information anywhere is that besides futuristic action thriller this is also a comedy. That is actually a reason I enjoyed it. The whole script is done with some exaggeration to be sure. Because of that you can overlook some logical holes and overall unreality...And while Arnold is really bad actor, he is only a part of a whole here, so with some toleration you may very well enjoy this flick after all.I was kinda surprised about it but I did... Above average deserves 6/10",The 6th Day
137,NolanSorrento,Don't expect another Total Recall or Running Man,5,3 December 2000,"Do you remember back in the 80's all the cool movies Arnold did? Movies with tons of action and really basic plots? And the over the top, comic book style violence?  Well... I think Arnold doesn't, 6th Day really bit.  I don't know if it's Arnold getting a little soft in his age or if he's trying to set some example, or maybe we can blame it on James Cameron and T2's so called non-violence theme where Arnold doesn't kill anybody but this movie really lacked what made him so popular in the 80's.6th Day had an almost made for TV feel to it.  Yeah, I know it's got a PG-13 label on it, but all that means is you here a couple of naughty 4 letter words here and there, big deal, easy to cover up when it shows on TV.  What really ticked me off was that each time you get to a classic AH-nuld scene of somebody getting shot, run over, or mutilated, you get a quick edit and therefore you miss a good chunk of the reason you came into the theater for. Why bother, save your $5 to $10 plus snack fee and just wait till it shows on TV, your not gonna miss much, except a couple of 4 letter naughty words, but we can all read lips, so you can figure it out. You'll also have to note the quick edits of an overview of some city traffic thru out the movie, a perfect spot for commercials.If this is supposed to be a part of the move for Arnold to put out for family oriented movies, I gotta say he missed the boat on that one too!  So what if there's no nudity, you still got the gun's and violent tones to it. If he's going to do family movies, then he should stick with the Kindergarten cops, not the Big Guns, unlimited ammo flicks. 
Arnold just needs to make up his mind, family flicks or brainless violence for the 18 - 34 male movie goers.",The 6th Day
138,pc_dean,Cloneing Around,7,18 November 2000,"Arnold Schwarzenegger apparently believes that you can never get enough Arnie.  From ""Total Recall"" to ""Last Action Hero,"" he spends a great deal of time playing himself opposite. . .himself.Crazy thing is, it works.  And, by and large, so does this movie.  In and among the bone-crunching and awful wisecracks we are entitled to in any Arnie opus, there are moments here and there where  the screenwriters seem to ponder the implications of their tale.In the movie, Arnie is a helicopter pilot in a sooner-than-you-think future society.  In a bizarre collision of covert villainy and bureaucratic incompetence, he is cloned while still alive, and the Bad Guys have to kill him, since he is evidence that they have cloned humans in violation of the ""6th Day"" laws.The story takes some twists and turns, some more predictable than others, and the pace is fast enough that you don't notice the plot holes here and there.One of the most entertaining aspects of ""The 6th Day"" is its portrait of a future that is an extension of our relentlessly interactive society.  This is a world where CNN is beamed to your shaving mirror, your refrigerator nags you to buy milk, and you have to ask your car for permission to drive. There is also a very funny scene involving a 911 call.The Bad Guys get killed and recycled with fair regularity, waking up cranky and complaining of aches and pains where they were shot or run over.  One dimwit thug is named Wiley (presumably his laser gun is an ACME model). 
The cast is good, although Michael Rapaport is underused, as is Robert Duvall, whose scenes with his dying wife deserve a movie of their own.The movie's major faults are in the direction, which is often too stylish for its own good, and the loose ends the story leaves all over the place in its rush to resolve itself in Arnie-flick fashion.  Still, it is entertaining, with a few million bucks' worth of digital effects put to good use, and a script that doesn't forget to be witty.In my personal favorite moment, an irascible hit-woman (sublimely bitchy Sarah Wynter) is revived on the cloning table, whereupon she is momentarily freaked, then complains about having to get her hair done again and plucks an earring off her own lifeless body.  It's a hard re-life.",The 6th Day

140,Rimmer-10,Too much Arnold,4,30 July 2001,"The subject cloning is interesting - and I also think that THE 6TH DAY treats the subjects quite well - the pros and cons are discussed. Maybe it's a bit black and white, but at least they try.But the main problem is Arnold. I've said it before and I'll say it again: he cannot act (quite a flaw for an actor). Whenever he gets intimate with his wife or has to be upset about something (show his emotions) - it gets painful to watch. And when he jokes with his helicopter partner - oooooohhh my God - it's bad beyond imagination.It's not a coincidence that the best Arnold movies are Terminator 1 and 2 - the less he talks the better the movie. Rating 4 of 10.",The 6th Day
141,grainstorms,"Clone With the Wind, or aging Austrian goes through old moves",2,3 December 2012,"The 6th Day is one of those movies that finds its inspiration in the cash register. Not one second of this tired and confusing film about cloning is fresh or original or understandable. Arnold Schwartzenegger, who had finally begun to look his 50-some odd years at the time of this film's making, despite layers of makeup and what looks to be like Herculean plastic surgery, moves like a man of some 50-odd years through the usual calisthenics that his parts call for: his accent, which has gotten thicker over the years, and his timing, which has just about vanished, makes the vapid jokes even less comprehensible, and for an actor with some 35 films under his belt by the time this film was made, his performance is rudimentary and perfunctory – as though he had other things on his mind, for instance, like a run for the governorship of California. Robert Duvall, shuffles through a role as a benign though mad scientist. He too just manages to croak out his lines. One can only hope that he too enjoyed a great payday. A few more parts like these and he will just about disappear from the screen. A scion of movie royalty, Tony Goldwyn, is the arch-villain, and his performance demonstrate the Motion Picture-Mendelian rule that Hollywood eventually destroys all talent genes, even if it takes several generations. When all else fails, and that comes very early in the proceedings, director Robert Spottiswoode, throws another 10 minutes of digital- enhanced imagery at the viewer. He was once quoted as saying, ""The movies I want to make are not people's priority. Nobody would touch them. They cost a lot of money, and studios no longer finance development, so if I didn't pay for them myself they wouldn't happen."" This picture shouldn't have happened.",The 6th Day
142,FatPhil,Action movie? Nope. Humerous? Nope. Message? Nope.,4,3 November 2003,"Possibly the worst Arnie movie ever. It tries to be a sensible movie, but has no suspension of disbelief. Worse than that it simply rehashes some old concepts out of prior movies such as Total Recall and perhaps Bladerunner, and glues them together with truly tedious action sequences and unimaginitive special effects.Not even worth me spending any more time reviewing it, to be honest.",The 6th Day

Arnie your too old for action movies and you can't act, find a new career. The special effects are B-movie standard, the story is a rehashed tabloid scare story. It has holes large enough to drive a Jumbo jet through etc, etc, etc. With better effects and a believable star (Bruce Willis where were you) and some light massaging of the script it could have been a worthy movie.

He talks to his wife about getting their dog cloned.  He goes to the Repetz store and eventually we find out that Arnold was there twice, asking virtually the same questions to the sales rep.  Arnold was totally against getting the dog cloned.  Then when he goes home, the dog was cloned and alive, meaning the original Arnold must have gotten the dog cloned.  Well, if one Arnold is a clone and one is human, and both of them think exactly alike (they somehow have the exact same way of thinking as a clone, not just the same body characteristics), then wouldn't the original Arnold also have been decidedly against getting the dog cloned??  Also, wouldn't the wife been entirely confused by having to explain the same thing (about the dog) to 2 Arnold's??  Obviously, since the 2nd Arnold was eventually the clone we were witnessing, then she must have spoken to the original Arnold at some point and told him to get the dog cloned!!  It makes no sense!!!

I also would like to commend the idea of the producers having clones taking over what and who's real.The storyline could have been smoother if the last part (where the real Gibson and his clone exchanged identity) or if cloning was then considered legal, but it was put to make twists and it made the story a lot better. It was a big surprise factor and may have flabbergasted its viewers. I really liked it.They could just have removed some of the scenes in the opening because it has nothing to do with the cloning. It was basically previewed to show augmented reality on a football game which may raise its being futuristic, but I think they could have focused more on the cloning part instead of focusing on the future as whole.How I hope this film would have a remake. Better yet, they could make a part 2 since the so-called ""near future"" where the cloning technology will arise is not yet present, it will still look futuristic.",The 6th Day

With Dollys alive and kicking and the human genom deciffered cloning is t h e SF-issue of the moment - both in fiction and in real life. Sadly the filmmakers prefered to come up with an ailing and tired chase movie, the chases being rather unexciting and the special effects unmistakeably not state of the art. I mean, when have you spotted so many continuity flaws in a costly Hollywood movie lately? And the casting doesn´t help either. Tony Goldwyn isn´t menacing at all even before we know about his real fate. Robert Duvall has pracitcally nothing to do. Michael Rappaport´s is just a walk on part. Michael Rooker isn´t allowed to act at all. And Arnold Schwarzenegger - whom nobody would expect to act - looks ill at ease with an action part that demands someone younger and - believe it or not - fitter.

The general cloning premise of the film also leads to the opportunity for social comment, especially in the light of the recent sheep cloning and such. Unfortunately, this film soon gets caked down into a stupid illegal cloning plot and becomes just another paint-by-numbers action flick. Even at their worst, most Schwarzenegger films have something to offer in terms of memorable lines or action scenes (hell, even Last Action Hero had its moments). But this one just sits there. I usually love Arnold's action flicks, because the big guy has a monstrous and charming screen presence, but in this one he's just kind of dull.

I think its a good movie to check out especially if your a ""Arnold Fan"" like myself and did it succeed well I'd say yes because of the story it had the character and having to Arnolds for the price of one. so if you liked ""total recall"" from 1990 I think is a one check out.",The 6th Day

Sure he can still shoot off a guys head from 250 meters away with three broken fingers, but who cares? its hollywood. He seems to be replaced with special effects and I do not like that.Also the lasers from ""Total Recall"" (which the story was also taken from) are in the movie and the stupid and ridiculous characters just the ones in ""Eraser"" and something from a disney movie are in here too.So please, I'm begging you, do not see this horrible movie.

If it also happens to be insightful or enlightening then that is a pleasant bonus. Inevitably, science fiction asks you to suspend your disbelief at one point or another. Again, this is not designed to be judged by Oscar worthy standards or as a universally appreciated form of high art. They make films in other genres where you can sate your longing for poignant, factual, emotionally charged or challenging material which, admittedly, can sometimes cover very heavy subject matter. There are certainly times when those types of movies serve as perfect fare. However, the values and themes of these films are often heightened and accentuated by the contrast of a more accessible, much cooler, less pretentious movie imbued with good FX, lots of action, big explosions and a lead performance that is obviously charismatic if not overly compelling.

Neither it is necessary to discard the special effects of this movie that are very spectacular (the scenes of shootings with guns laser and the helicopters charter).

But as already noted, this is not a brainless action movie..It is very absorbing since it involves the cloning of people and the lookalikes that pop up in the movie keep the viewer guessing who is who or what until the end...Arnold is his regular self..Clumsy as an actor but somehow not offending and in his gigantic sort of way kind of likable and convincing even...The mystery of this guy's popularity cannot be fully discussed here, but one thing is certain .This film is not a disappointment.It is in my book his best after T2 and Total recall.And these are the only three movies by Arnie that you must see.... It surprises me that many rate True lies higher although it has a much poorer (to put it mildly) plot.Maybe the ideas on which the storyline progresses are not original but they are put in very good use...

156,monty-57,The straight-faced sequel to TWINS,6,21 April 2009,"Although cloning is not all that new a subject in films, it has never been adequately mined as a theme. The new Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle THE 6TH DAY, now playing at local theaters, uses cloning as a mere superficial plot device, giving a slightly novel twist to what is essentially a standard B-actioner masquerading as a topical sci-fi film. The film is itself a clone, echoing director Paul Verhoeven's TOTAL RECALL in a number of ways, from its concepts of recording memory right down to Arnie's ride in an automated taxi.Set in the near future, subtitled with the dire prognostication ""Sooner Than You Think,"" the film offers a look at human society comfortable with making exact genetic copies of ailing pets but living in fear at the very real possibility of cloning anything remotely human. After a failed experiment sometime in the past, fully cloning humans has been outlawed.Schwarzenegger plays family man Adam Gibson, a helicopter pilot who returns home one day to find a man who looks exactly like him celebrating his daughter's birthday. He is instantly hunted by a motley gang of hired guns, most of whom look like refugees from your local alternative dance club. Prolific B-movie actor Michael Rooker plays the zealous, trench coat wearing, square-jawed leader of the crew. The twist here is that every time Arnold kills one of this bunch, he (or she in one case) is cloned, memory restored with the aid of CD-ROMs, and continues to hunt Arnold.Duped into signing a phony flight contract by some corporate suits, Gibson's friend Hank (Michael Rapaport) is killed. Gibson then traces various links to a sinister corporation where ostensibly donor organs are grown using cloning techniques, but where the upscale high-tech nerd Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) is plotting to take over the world through the aid of clones.Cloning is seen as a subject of controversy in a straightforward, simplistic way in the film, as liberals protest the growth of human spare parts through cloning, while the rich folk (who presumably can afford quality health care) line up at $1000-a-head dinners to support the effort. A renegade scientist, Dr. Griffin Weir (Robert Duvall) tires and quits, heartbroken by the pleas of his ailing wife to quit bringing her back through cloning. She implores him to let her die a natural death. The latter sequence is the only point where the film slows down slightly and becomes a tad thoughtful, and actually begins to look as if it will say something halfway important about the possibility of cloning, only to lose the thought and turn back to the mayhem instead.Director Roger Spottiswoode, whose previous effort was the over-the-top James Bond film TOMORROW NEVER DIES, keeps things moving at a frenetic pace, creating scenes which competently mix action with state-of-the-art special effects. The film is long on fury and visuals, but short on story and character development. It delivers the goods in the action department, and Arnie even gets to deliver a couple of the trademark one-liners audiences love him for, but every thing else about the film is pretty wooden. Arnie's wife and child are cardboard, and it is hard to actually identify with him trying to save them. Spottiswoode really does not seem to be at home in the sci-fi genre, and many sequences seem somehow lackluster, despite being technically well produced. The film degenerates into the standard everyman-against-mad-scientist-playing-god brouhaha pretty quickly. Essentially, it is just another twin movie, and not even one that is all that great.Many an action star has come to a point in their career when they make a twin film - Jackie Chan with TWIN DRAGONS, Jean-Claude Van Damme with DOUBLE IMPACT. Here, however, the possibilities for interaction between identical twins, or in this case clones, are left unexplored. When Schwarzenegger finally does meet his double (TWINS with Danny DeVito doesn't count), the scene is anti-climactic, and it is never shown or explained how he was able to convince his double to team up with him against the bad guys.It can be said that Arnold is a better actor than he was fifteen years ago. His new family-man image in the film mirrors his current life, but the transitions from doting daddy to bone-crushing behemoth in other parts of the film are jarring and inconsistent. Still, here Arnie is more human, slightly more expressive and mellowed with age. He does more for the film than the film does for him.",The 6th Day
157,strogger,Very entertaining action comedy with a heart and a message...,10,16 December 2000,"This film is good fun. There are some nice effects and some great comedy. Arnold gives one of his cheesier performances (his acting is very ott in places) but it works for this movie, his acting just made me me laugh even more. I loved it when Arnold tasted the breakfast his daughter makes him. It also greatly amused me when he revealed he is still as strong as ever at the beginning by showing off his bicep to his on-screen wife. Sure the film has its flaws. The script is over written (I read an earlier draft of the script which I think was better) and the action could have been much better.

160,chrisf-uk,Impressive,9,31 August 2001,"I thought this was a terrific Arnie move, it's such a shame to see it languishing at 6.1 on IMDB. First of all, I found the story thought-provoking and emotionally compelling. The scenes with Dr. Weir and his wife on her deathbed stand out, and the bittersweet ending wraps things up very nicely indeed. Arnie's great: he's perfectly good in this role and still has awesome onscreen presence. If anything, I think he's improving with age - kind of like a younger Charlton Heston.What else ? The effects are nice ('Simpal Cindy' is an amazing - if slightly creepy - creation) and the movie portrays a realistic and compelling vision of the near future. The script's well done, on the whole, and there are a couple of sly in-jokes that made me smile ('I _might_ be back'... guess you had to be there!) There's also a killer plot twist somewhere in the middle, that brings to mind Total Recall.Oh, and the stirring musical score is excellent : one of the best I've heard in a long time. Had me thinking of Hans Zimmer, but it's not : it's Trevor Rabin, a name I will certainly look out for in future.All in all, a great couple of hours. Highly recommended.",The 6th Day
161,KeyC0de,Awful story!,4,15 August 2020,"This movie is Hollywoodism at its purest. Big budget, big names, good special effects, zero substance. The story is SOOO BAD; it is downright lazy; it is baffling how they could come up with a plot THIS bad, when they had resources and potential to do more. The story in itself doesn't make any sense at all and you might get a feel of that from the very first minutes of the movie (I did), because of the complete absence of talent on the writing department.
All characters including the protagonist are one dimensional. Character development? What's that?It is almost laughable and I reckon they realized it, possibly during mid production and decided to give it a lighter tone (roughly glimpsed here and there). This is an unintentionally bad movie which is a plus as it does have plenty of funny moments. However it's goals are not obvious as it is advertised as an Action, Mystery(?) + SciFi film. I would give a far more favorable review if it was featured as an action comedy and actually went all in with the exaggerations and funny events; but as it stands I can't give it much.
Acting is subpar as well from almost all actors and some are terrible, notable Terry Crews is deplorable it makes you both laugh and cry at the same time.Even at times when there are hints that something interesting is about to be revealed the audience instead gets the finger for hoping that there could be something of value;
example: like when Adam and Hank are speaking, Schwarzenegger pulls his worst one-liners I know of, to seal the end of one of the only two semi interesting dialogue scenes in the entire movie.Despite all this, the film is watchable and keeps you somewhat entertained because of the action, special effects, a scent of humor thrown left and right randomly and 2 good actors Rooker & Duvall who clearly don't get to show much of their skills.
Couple all this with Schwarzenegger's aging factor which can't be overlooked and you have a bad film.
This is a funny-bad movie for all the wrong reasons.

163,invincible_seattle,Perhaps Schwarzenegger's best acting yet (spoilers),10,5 February 2003,"For a movie to be successful, it has been said that actors must share ""chemistry"" with their co-stars to make their acting appear the most realistic.  That is true, but I see it a bit further; to me the direction of acting is more important than acting itself to make it look the most convincing on the screen.Such is the case with ""The 6th Day"" (2000, Columbia).  In this case, Arnold Schwarzenegger, perhaps one of the most high-profile superstars of our generation, was signed on to deliver a performance that requires a great deal of emotion, particularly since the role has dual characters.  Not particularly known for emotion-driven performances, Arnold was likely signed on to guarantee Columbia Pictures at least $40-50 million in box-office revenue.  And to direct Schwarzenegger, veteran 'good-guy' actor Robert Duvall, and a long list of smaller and relatively unknown talent, is Roger Spottiswoode.My personal movie library contains two other Spottiswoode titles: ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" (1997, United Artists), and ""Stop! or my Mom will Shoot!"" (1992, Universal).  I liked the Stallone comedy and hated the Bond action-fest, making Spottiswoode's standing as a director far from high-calibre.  Yet with that in mind, ""The 6th Day"" struck me with its ferocious intensity and its amazingly unconventional approach to delivering a fairly common plot. And Schwarzenegger manages to keep his muscles concealed for most of the film and turns in a powerful performance, one that is perhaps Arnold's best acting yet.Co-stars Michael Rapaport (also seen in ""Metro"" [1997, dir. Thomas Carter, Touchstone] and ""Cop Land"" [1997, dir. James Mangold, Miramax]) and Michael Rooker (also seen in ""The Bone Collector"" [1999, dir. Phillip Noyce, Universal] and ""Cliffhanger"" [1993, dir. Renny Harlin, TriStar]) seem to lose their identities and became the characters of Hank Morgan and Robert Marshall, respectively.  And Tony Goldwyn, whom I had only previously seen in ""The Pelican Brief"" (1993, dir. Alan J. Pakula, Warner Brothers), amazed me with the sincerity and presence he brought to the character of Michael Drucker, the billionare owner of the company that secretly and illegally makes genetically deficient clones.Behind the scenes of these powerful and believable performances, mixed perfectly with spectacular and near seamless visual effects/stunts, is Roger Spottiswoode, who pieced the film together with a quality that I feel ranks with legendary greats such as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962, dir. Robert Mulligan, Universal) and ""Seven Days in May"" (1964, dir. John Frankenheimer, United Artists).If you haven't seen this movie, I have rated it a 10.  My standards are generally quite rigid, and a 10 means that I found it not only well-made, but convincing, having a profound impact on my judgment toward the topic being discussed, and overall impression of the direction/acting.Watch it.  You'll be impressed.",The 6th Day
164,jeffdiggy,Surprisingly Good Sleeper!!,9,14 June 2009,"I'm giving this film a 9 because there were some technical errors and I don't believe in perfection. Having said that this movie was near perfect to me - if (also) you overlook Arnie's acting (which I do because he is always funny to me). But anyway - this movie is very good for Sci-Fi/future buffs. It made me think of things I never thought of before like cloning animals (in this movie fish) for future food sources and (b) the method of transferring a person's (old) memory into a cloned body...as well as cool side concepts like remote controlled, jet transforming helicopters and a realistic looking/seeming laser gun (usually a deficient knock-off from Star Wars, but depicted very well in this movie). The acting by the subordinate characters was also great. Robert Duvall, of course was his usual great self...Michael Rapaport was good and I REALLY liked the performance put in by the ruthless Michael Drucker - played exceptionally by Tony Goldwyn. The story was great and everything flowed very well. Arnie, again, was pretty funny in this one: I loved the part where he was trying to get a toy doll (he had purchased for his daughter after the family dog died) to shut up. He was told by the taxi driver to tell the doll to ""go to sleep""...and he really sounded believable in his annoyance by saying ""yeah, go to sleep"". Overall - I have watched this movie 3 times now and will watch it again. It has that 'Soylent Green' appeal of foreseeing what the future may hold - and it's inevitable, questionable, dilemma-posing aspects! This one is definitely a winner that was slept on (perhaps because of the Y2K phenomenon - I'm not sure because I don't even remember hearing about this movie when it came out in 2000)?? I see it going down as a great reference for the reality of human cloning (another 'good see' on this topic that comes to mind is ""Boys From Brazil""). Very few movies have touched the subject of human cloning? Do I smell cover-up??",The 6th Day

Arnold, a bit more wrinkled around the eyes, has matured in his acting quite a bit (hey, remember Conan) and is charming to watch. The supporting cast is good. The production value, while not quite up to the matrix standards, is above par for it's day. Most of the camera work is conservative, and they've added in some spastic scene-to-scene cuts (similar to ""Blade"") which add to the tech tone. The plot is, well, a sci fi plot about human cloning, which has not been beaten to death just yet, and provides some interest.

The comedy was really good as Arnold keeps killing off the same people.  ""Don't you guys ever stay dead?"" and ""When I told you to screw yourself, I didn't mean for you take it literally!"".

It involves a futuristic plot where human cloning is illegal (but animal cloning is not) and a rich owner of a technology company who decides to reverse the law banning it by proving to the world that cloning is possible. The main character is a war veteran who takes the occupation of an average everyday helicopter pilot (Schwarzenegger) who one day finds out that he has been cloned. To get his life back, he had to find the people who did this and make them stop their madness. Great movie, the only problem is that there are some sudden changes to the plot which left me scratching my head. But overall, solid entertainment! I have stated that this movie is underrated, IT IS!

In a slightly futuristic setting thats not all that impressive, the action and acting don't add up to much more then a B film with sorry attempted humor and unconvincing fight scenes.  Fancy editing cuts don't seem to serve much purpose, and the premise of the plot as well as all of the characters besides Arnolds and the main bad guy could have used developing.

Although far from Arnold's worse film, 6th Day could well have been up there with his best movies. The plot is a good idea - topical and Sci-fi that uses science that exists now, or will very soon be possible. There are other cloning movies, but this is the first movie I had seen where they had an 'explanation' of how humans could be cloned so quickly. They had the adult human 'shells' that just needed the DNA to be infused to quickly grow a clone. The other first in this movie, was that this was the first movie that I'd seen where clones could easily be identified as clones - if you knew where to look. However, the movie was too long, and the subplot with the remote helicopters (although cool) was convoluted and awkward.

A cloned character picks an earring from their previous body and complains about having to pierce their ear again. A customer enters a pet-cloning shop and wonders if his daughter really won't see the difference.This movie probably won't engage you at a deep emotional level. None of the characters is much fleshed out, but still, they serve effectively to convey a wide range of attitudes towards death, grief, cloning, identity, that I'm still waiting to see in another movie.But, The 6th Day does not shovel its messages down your throat. In the end, you're free to pick and choose what you'll retain. And if you just wanna relax and enjoy a dumb Schwarzie one-liner action movie ? Sure, you can !

Honestly after I sat through End of Days I called into question his ability to return to the screen after what seemed like a very long hiatus. This movie deals with (give some leway) cloning and both the good and the bad moral aspects of what the ability to clone means. It presents both reasons for and reasons against cloning. The action sequences are fun and I want one of those helicopter airplane hybrids. This movie in NO WAY resembles ""The Matrix"" and is NOT a remake of ""Total Recall"". To say that it is to insult Paul Verhoeven's/Phillip K. Dick's effort in Recall. The only similarity is both characters wake up in a cab with a few things they can't remember.

180,anton-79,Pretty good science-fiction action film,6,31 March 2007,"This is a pretty good science-fiction action film. The setting is interesting and leads believably to decent action sequences that are not too long and boring, and the plot is resolved pretty decently.The weaknesses of this film are: 1) a lot of the premise is presented in exposition form where the villains tell our hero unbelievably willingly the why, what, and how of what is happening to him. 2) The plot background is far less far-reaching than what I expected at first (it ends with Drucker); OK, my expectations are probably coming from other films with similar topics, so this is probably not the fault of this film. 3) The murder of Hank at the start of the film makes no sense: First of all, murdering Drucker was pointless, because he was going to be replaced with another clone anyway; moreover, through Drucker's murder the assassin blew his cover anyway, so there was no point in murdering Hank to keep his cover; oh, and while we are at it, if Drucker's people did not know who was Hank and who was Adam, how did they know whom to clone? Anyway, by Hollywood standards these are just minor nits.This film seems to be the first in the modern wave of science-fiction films that explore a specific issue based on some hypothetical technology, e.g., Minority Report (2002) and I, Robot (2004); there were earlier films of that kind in the 70s (e.g., Soylent Green (1973), and most appropriately here: Westworld (1973) and Futureworld (1976)), but I don't remember much of this kind in between. Some other films I was reminded of were Blade Runner (1982), especially in the ending, and Total Recall (1994).",The 6th Day
181,brendanfoy,This could have been one of Arnold's classics,5,6 February 2013,"I remember seeing this movie and being disappointed as both a science fiction and Arnold fan. It's not that the movie is bad, it's because it shows so many signs of greatness yet falls short mostly because of two odd decisions: Arnold and the PG-13 rating. The story was surprisingly compelling for an Arnold film, but this movie should have never cast Arnold if they wanted to focus on story and character. Since they did cast Arnold, it was mind boggling to me that the action was so toned down and lame, especially when compared to his past sci-fi flicks like Total Recall and The Running Man.So after nearly 13 years since I first saw it in the theaters I decided to watch it again, and have the same problems I did the first time through. Whose bright idea was it to cast Arnold? Whose bright idea was it to make it PG-13? These decisions kill the movie.I never paid much attention to ratings and their effects on movies, particular the action genre, until 4 years ago when I watched Taken and felt something was missing from the action scenes. While Taken was still a great action flick with cleverly edited fights to avoid the R rating, the action in The 6th Day is watered down as hell. The action scenes are drawn out and boring as if they were never supposed to be there in the first place, just added in because Arnold was the lead. The nags I have with this film:An uncensored Michael Rooker could have been just as awesome as Michael Ironside in Total Recall.Arnold's character was a combat seasoned war veteran, yet we didn't see him in any meaningful fights and only saw him break one guy's neck in the tamest way possible. He also spent most of his time fighting the woman, which was odd. There should have been one hell of a bloody battle between him and Terry Crews, but we got nothing.The guns are plasma based and while they look cool at first, ballistic based weapons would have been far more satisfying. The plasma gun allowed them to keep in line with the rating and avoid bloody bullet holes and traditional gun violence. Yes Michael Rooker got his foot burned off, but it was done cleanly and in a comedic way. These gun battles were very boring and dragged on, particularly towards the end.The main antagonist's death at the end was woefully unsatisfying for an action film featuring Arnold, but they couldn't show him getting chopped up by the helicopter rotors or going splat once he hit the ground because of the rating.The ""go clone yourself so you can go *beep* yourself"" line was a misfire because it wasn't worded as I wrote it. The line was still funny, but should have been straight to the point as classic Arnold would have said it. The next time he says it, he uses the word ""screw"" because his one time use of the F word was up thanks to the rating. Arnold can't act, his appeal comes from his screen presence and facial expressions while kicking ass on screen. This script demanded an actual actor, not an action star.So Arnold held this back from being a better thriller and the rating held this back from being a great Arnold film. It was a major missed opportunity which is a damn shame.",The 6th Day

It confronts various moral and ethical issues on the subject of cloning while providing decent action with Arnie dishing it out to the bad guys.

Best utilised as a cool-looking ubermann mumbling cynical one-liners while dishing out Red Heat, Arnie delivers double-vamdammage here with two versions of himself. True to B-movie script, the semantics are squeezed into a few scenes, the main editing leaving us a disjointed series of the Running Man escaping the End of his Days as the terminators seek to Erase him.  For a supposedly regular working family man, Arnie's character displays Commando instincts, more Predator than prey, taking delight from killing while hamming up `Aw-shucks' Kindergarten Cop scenes.  While it not fair to dump on what is essentially an action flick, it is a bit of a Raw Deal for the paying viewer, as the endless violence we seek by watching an Arnie show is not as polished here.",The 6th Day

As someone else commented ""the story is too transparent"". When you spend this much money on a movie, one could expect a better manuscript.  I cannot understand why Hollywood, time and time again makes this mistake.  They throw money after the stars and the set decorators, but do not at all care about the script.Do those executives think we are stupid ?  Yes they do.  They think that having a great star is an insurance for a box office hit. Even though they know this is not true (e.g. last action hero).

Something about the action sequences just didn't get me involved at the edge of my seat level that they should have.However my biggest gripe (and yes I'm a nerd/engineer and perhaps you won't mind these things as I did), was how stupid it is.  I am not saying that cloning a human being will not be possible in the near future, just not as the film depicts.  The idea that you can make a ""blank human"", one ""missing all the details"" that distinguish you from everyone else is just nonsense.  No matter how dull (by some measure) a face is, it still has a genetic code for that face and the muscle and bone under it and on and on that is every bit as complex (the DNA that is) as any other face.  On top of that the idea that you can just some how change the DNA of every cell, and then the body actually will (in only 2 hrs no less) alter itself to be as if it were grown with that new DNA is also just stupid.   Even one of the centerpieces of the action sequences, the X-wing helicopters are done poorly.  No problem with the X-wing idea, but the remote control is silly in that I don't see how you could be piloting one ship (he says 2 pilots can fly 4 ships) with that moving frame of reference, and at the same time fly another, in other than the simplest of manuvers, since humans can not (as far as I know) readily comprehend two frames of reference concurrently).The real surprise is why such a great actor as Duval would bother with this luke warm project.

188,nearvanaman,Flawed,3,5 October 2001,"In all the years I'm watching Arnie movies, nothing has really changed. The action is fast and furious, the acting ability is non-existent and the level of belief-suspension is high. ""The 6th Day"" continues the trend as Hollywood broaches the en vogue subject of human cloning - a subject that is sure to ""inspire"" numerous projects in tinsel town in the next decade or so.We're vaguely told that it is sometime in the future and while human cloning is outlawed, the cloning of animals has become an acceptable way to replace that dead pet situation that we all hate to deal with. Replacement Technologies, the major cloning institute in the US, is run by businessman Michael Drucker (Goldwyn - ""The Pelican Brief"", ""Nixon"", ""Kuffs"", ""Kiss the Girls""). Although they advertise their animal cloning services and research, behind the scenes they have already been involved in the sinister cloning of humans, using the expertise of Dr Griffin Weir (Robert Duvall).A 'sixth day violation' occurs when Replacement Technologies mistakingly clone Adam Gibson (Schwarzenneger) believing him to be killed in a shoot-out. Gibson returns home to find that his clone has already assumed his life and now Replacement want him captured and murdered in order to keep their secret safe. If anyone sees Gibson and his clone together, then those people will be killed and Gibson realises that the only way he can put an end to the nightmare is to infiltrate Replacement and stop their operation.""The 6th Day"" can be pretty much be summed up by the word 'flawed'. The idea of human cloning throws up numerous interesting premises, and indeed director Spottiswoode (""Tomorrow Never Dies"", ""And the Band Played On"", ""Stop or my Mom Will Shoot"") plays on the unique idea with some genuinely amusing lines ('Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?' - Gibson) and situations. His direction though never really excites - the action scenes are sloppy, interest wanes very easily throughout the movie, and the schmalzy ending is just sad.As I mentioned, the best element of the movie is the humour. Arnie gets to play with some genuinely funny lines and the scene which sees Michael Rooker convince a cop that his Replacement colleague is perfectly alive and not suffering from a broken neck, is hilarious. The cast, mind you, is practically next-to-useless. Outisde of Robert Duvall and his screen wife Katherine (Wanda Cannon), there is little talent or charisma present between the motley crew of Rooker, Goldwyn, Rapaport and Crewson. Schwarzenneger performs with his usual strong-arm vigour so it's the same old-same old there.Cloning is a great subject for the big screen and I think we will see better movies than this. Not recommended.",The 6th Day

I hated it. Why?* The writers came up with something that should be an interesting starting point, the ethical questions about cloning. However, instead of going deeper in the subject, it just misused this premise as an excuse for lots of explosions and car-chases. Absolutely nothing is even mildly original here.* The special effects are very bad in places (when the bad guy's legg is shot off for example). The CGI effects are so-so.* The plot doesn't make sense in a lot of places (spoiler alert):-""You can't clone a brain, but you can clone a whole body"". SAY WHAT?!Arnie goes to the re-pet store to clone his dog who just died. After a while, it is suggested that the 'other' Arnie was there before him (The salesman's remark ""Still can't make up your mind, huh?""). But, after that Arnie drives home and finds the other Arnie *with the cloned dog""!-Arnie is supposed to be the good, loving father and husband having some moral troubles with the hole cloning thing. But when he's chased by bad guys he immediately starts getting *sadistic pleasures* out of running over them.

This Total-Recall type action flick has a soul! (Not to mention its one of the best Arnie flicks in recent history!)Arnold Schwarzenagger plays Adam Gibson, a family man living in the near future with his kids, his wife, and dog.  That is until he is suddenly cloned without his concent by Drucker (Tony Goldwyn)  It's all lies and conspiracies for the rest of the show, so Arnold has to discover why he was cloned and save his entire family in the process.Personally, I thought this film was a fascinating look into the possible world of cloning and the dangers we may face if we decide to bring it into this worldExcellent acting overall, expecially Robert duvall, who plays the scientist that made the cloning of humans a reality.

I have been itching for some good old-fashioned Arnold...and here it is. He's mean. He's tough. He's a great shot. Don't mess with Arnold...right on!I liked this movie...but I didn't love it. Too many bad guys. Not enough development of the supporting cast (his wife, daughter and friend had very small roles, in fact everyone had a small role except him because there were so many of them).The story, however, is disturbing, because it is so close to being believable. We can probably clone a human in the near future, but it would begin life as a fetus and have to grow normally. To be able to make a carbon copy of people...this is TOO SCARY and the movie clearly showed that.I am sure you will enjoy this movie, but I don't think I'll be buying the video, and Commando is still my favorite Arnold movie (Oh...I also really liked Last Action Hero, how about that?!)",The 6th Day

Despite all the risks arising from a national or even international fingerprint database, I'd very much appreciate such a simple way of paying.*SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD* The film's about cloning and its possible consequences.

It is a no brainer, so Arnie fans will feel at home and he is starting to find his feet again after Batman & Robin.  It has a good story but bad dialog, just like the rest of Arnies movies.

If you don't make contact with brain, you cant scan it, it is as simple as that, well if people in the future really can do it without contact, you cannot scan all brain from eyes, because different parts of brain act separately and need to be scanned from the location they are, otherwise the waves from the part, that is in front of the other part, disrupt each other, besides brainwaves only come when things happen in the brain, it doesn't just send out everything.

Now Sixth Day I scored 7 because the techical work was good and tech work does count in Sci-Fi game otherwise it would have been a 6.  The main difference between the two is that Arnie delivers on stories and, while not claiming to be a great actor, certainly is an actor.

Non-Arnold fans will not believe that Arnold is back until he makes a uncharted movie, a movie so great that no one saw it coming.Arnold fans however, believed he was back with End of Days saying it was a good movie and Arnold was really good.  The middle ground always rules because it uses the most rationality.  The middle ground fans feel that Arnold is back but aren't sure how long it will last.  I personally respect Arnold as an actor he has got better over the years and has better performances to come.  The movie The Sixth Day as his newest installment like the first line predicted, was looked at skeptically, Unfortuanately for Arnold the world hasn't fully accepted his comeback yet and this movie didn't successfully convert the non believers.  It is this fact that brings the movie down which has nothing to do with the actual movie or Arnold himself.  The movie itself brought a great idea and a great action script with Arnold who plays the part(s) really well.  Great use of comic relief, suspense, dramatic irony, and mystery.  The one item that hits below great was the action, but the movie was so well done that the unoriginal action sequences didn't faze it, but i did like the parking garage decaptiation part.  This movie did NOT SUCK it was intelligent and competent but failed to be the uncharted movie that Arnold was looking for.  Even though it was a great movie and its a shame that it will take an uncharted movie to put Arnold 100 percent back on the map the bottom line is that ITS HARD TO HIT A HOME RUN WHEN YOU TRY TOO HARD.

Honestly, I couldn't follow it toward the end anyway because of all the science goings-on, and I kind of lost interest after a while because of that.

Playing god has become normalised in the human sense of authority over the planet, and aesthetic value placed over authenticity. This film predicts pet cloning for example, and has creepy interactions with a doll and a hologram which highlights the morality of creating a.i for the human pleasure dome. The acting is above par, though at times the script and language use are painfully outdated is really my only criticism. The clothes are on point, I especially enjoyed the early noughties take on cyber punk post punk. The film also takes into play family values, the philosophy of what being human means, raises questions about social hierarchy, and the right to live (definitely feeling blade runner vibes). Albeit this could have been slicker, it could have been more well delivered in terms of tone and suspense however its appeal is certainly the overall message and questions it raises regarding cloning and the consequences of human perception.",The 6th Day
210,jasm_it,A great little Hidden GEM,10,11 February 2021,I have overrated this because it is far beyond a 5.9 and in my opinion is a high 6 or low 7 even with the drag factor of Arnie's corny acting. In some regards the vision of the future is prophetic and the concept and implementation of cloning and how it is interceded in society are well thought out and developed. The motives and actions of the protagonist and antagonist also make perfect sense and once again show realistic caveats and corruption that might occur if human cloning was such a thing and makes you think and consider some the ethics and motives behind other agents in the film. These fleshed out concepts really help develop the plot line with some good twists thrown with your classic but generic action sequences in a pretty well paced film with special effects which still hold up pretty well even under HD scrutiny. With the exception of the dolls head being chucked out of the car and some interesting and convenient transitions in editing.Not just a brainless action film and the plot and concept is better than 90% of current films being pumped out now.,The 6th Day

It should have been other actor to play Adam Gibson and this director was obviously not a good choice. This is seriously one of the most exciting stories about cloning and its effects. Hitler himself was trying to develop an instrument that could introduce one's memories into human brain, in a way that when he died he could be cloned and they'll use that technology with him.

I had two real problems with the film. First,  Adam (one Arnold's characters) is one minute a mild mannered loving father and the next he is twisting heads off.  Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde so to speak.  The two characters didn't go together.  Bad script writing I guess.The second problem that I had was that the real story in this film is the religious zealots opposition to cloning.  Actually it is the lack of including this factor into the film beyond the 5 minutes that a zealot shows up and is then iced to prevent his own cloning for interigation.If you like Arnold you may like this film.

There are plenty of corny jokes, explosions, and over-the-top death scenes (all rated PG-13). Schwarzenegger does a decent job in this film, but the true talent lies with Michael Rapaport, playing best-friend Hank Morgan, and Tony Goldwyn as the wonderfully evil Michael Drucker. The rest of the cast give passing performances with no one standing out one way or another. While the plot is a little more complicated than something like ""Predator"", it is still easy enough to follow and makes for an enjoyable 120 minutes.

Nothing different here.

With that said, No one should go to an Arnold movie looking for much more than action, it is what he does.  While this movie clearly has an agenda, to make a statement about the 'dangers' of human cloning, it never really takes the issue seriously enough, and obviously looked for the right answers by polling focus groups (the obvious rebuke of science for not thinking ethically and 'morally' about what scientists choose to research, such a popular stance lately).  Taken for what it was supposed to be, an hour and a half of fun wrapped around something sort of interesting to think about, it is a first rate movie.",The 6th Day
225,albatross4242,arnie back in sci fi finally,9,28 December 2001,"out of all the scharzenegger flics i've seen, the only ones i've actually liked were his sci-fi genre movies, predator is stretching it since its mostly fantasy and not sci-fi but still it falls into the genre sci-fi even if its not truly sci-fi, with the exception of twins (thanks to devito) and true lies, his non-sci-fi movies are almost unwatchable, even his pure action flics (i.e. commando) are just horrid, but when he touches sci-fi his cheezy acting fits it perfectly and makes for a very enjoyable movie to watch (total recall, t1, t2, etc)  6th day brings arnie back where he belongs, to the sci-fi realm, and from the looks of it he's finally coming back home!",The 6th Day
226,suemccartin-1,I really liked this movie...........,7,10 March 2009,"I think that there were parts of this movie that could have been better done but overall I really did like it, there was action it moved well and the acting wasn't bad. This movie really does make you think about how something like Human cloning could be abused if put in the wrong hands. I'm all for fixing human diseases, but going so far as making perfect copies....ahhhh not sure I like that too much; what chance would the normal folk have in a world populated by the best of the best (or clones of same). Personally I think we're technologically closer to cloning than we are to the other science presented in this movie, downloading the entire human brain so it could be uploaded to the new clone---even our most advanced computers today would be not be able to hold all the information our brains are capable of storing. Like Gattaca, this movie makes you think on the issue (gattaca was not cloning just manipulation). It is a science that needs to be investigated but we need to keep corporate greed out of it and prevent its misuse by any one person; I'm not saying any one government is up to that task because it isn't. I always like a movie with a moral message and this one does a good job of presenting that. It's worth seeing.",The 6th Day
227,pauldoherty972,This is a standout movie - excellent and coherent plot,9,8 November 2020,"Don't let the fact this is a sci-fi action movie fool you; this is an excellent movie that has a consistent and interesting plot, well-written dialogues, an excellent cast, and makes for intriguing observations on what humans messing with DNA could result in. I just rewatched this movie and found it even better than I remembered it.",The 6th Day
228,automobileman59,6th Day Rocks!,10,17 September 2005,"All I can say is that I don't understand why this movie was rated LOW???!!! I absolutely loved this movie. Arnold was great, all the acting was wonderful. The special effects were awesome! I loved seeing Talia and Wiley being Cloned, it was so awesome! The plot line was easy to follow and the plot made me think, why and how? ha-ha. The Facts were almost always right and I saw no mistakes. I really hope that our world can become like that whatever year that was. To have amazing technology and engineering skills. I just love this awesome movie! I can watch this movie all day and over and over again. I definitely rate The 6th Day a 10 out of 10!",The 6th Day
229,d_klimov,Far better than given credit for.,8,8 March 2020,"One of the better, & so often underrated sci-fi thrillers, with elements of comedy & action, which in my humble opinion, is no less spectacular than Arnold's classic, ""Total Recall"". The story takes palace in a distant future, & it's about this pilot named Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a happy family man, who one day comes home & finds out that someone, his identical lookalike, is living his life, with his wife & daughter, & while he himself is just a clone with the original's memories. Not only that, he must now deal with those behind this whole, illegal cloning thing in order to dispose of him. & of course things don't go as planned. I mean c'mon! It's Arnold! Whatcha expect?
Anyways, I'll be completely honest, this movie is quite intelligent. It has plenty ""to think about"" material, it's got its own unique philosophy, & of course, it delivers on most technical aspects, such as decent visuals, dope scenery, as well as well-timed & paced action. The cast does not disappoint either. Arnold was still on top of his game back then, despite the age, Tony Goldwyn makes a good villain, & Robert Duvall's presence only adds credit. Would also like to point out Michael Roomer, Michael Rapaport & a debuting Terry Crews, all being on point in supporting roles. Now, the writing could have been more collected of course & thought out more precisely, so it doesn't leave question marks here & there, loosing focus at times, but for the film, in general, being as entertaining as it is, all of that can easily be forgiven. Given the fact that many films (which are more successful) have almost as many plot holes, if not more.
Overall, this movie is nowhere near perfect, but it, sure as hell, is fun. I think most of the hate it gets is undeserving. It delivers in terms of thrills, sometimes even resembling those 60's flicks of the same genre & similar concept. I'm scoring it an 8/10, for it being this enjoyable despite the criticism.",The 6th Day
230,SpankyBelfield,Thoroughly Enjoyable Film,9,10 May 2005,"Having seen the poor 5.9 average rating that IMDb.com's users gave the film, I would be lying if I said I had hopes watching this film. But I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this film.I know Schwarzeneggar has his critics, I understand that he is not the most talented actor to grace the big screen, but I have loved most of his movies. His on screen presence is easily enough to make up for any lack of acting ability.I was surprised, also, that this film had quite an interesting narrative. The cloning idea was more or less genius! I thought it may be the usual Arnie kicking the hell out of all comers for no apparent reason, but it goes deeper than that, exploring the potential problems that new technologies may cause.My overall judgement is a 9 out of 10, which is above average for my Arnie ratings. I can't help but feel that this film has suffered in the ratings due to people's ideas of Schwarzeneggar and his films. But I rarely find a film starring him that disappoints me, and thankfully this was no acception!!",The 6th Day
231,rob2e,Great script,8,23 November 2000,"I liked the story originality.  Great show!  Some say Arnold might be getting too old, but I certainly think he did a great job here.  Michael Rapaport was excellent too.  I thought the writing was fantastic here.  I really enjoyed this movie.",The 6th Day
232,Spinbad,Very good underrated film,9,21 January 2002,"How can a mindless cringe prompter like ""Stuart Little"" rake in all-time level box office revenues, while this film ranks nowhere in sight?I saw ""The Sixth Day"" again last night to double-check whether temporary delirium caused my excellent impression first time around.
No mirage - just as good. Happy testimony from two co-watchers backs me up.
One is a chick-flick lover/Arnie-loather who I had to plead with to give this film a chance. The other just could not understand how he hadn't heard about it before.""The Sixth Day"" provides a detailed, sensitive and thoughtful presentation of the subject of cloning. At the same time, the film is action-packed, funny and replete with imaginative and quite plausible futuristic touches. All packaged within a tightly woven plot and fast-flowing screenplay. How many films have you seen recently combining so many great aspects?The film's world is one where the first human was imperfectly cloned in an experiment a decade ago and ""sixth day laws"" (per Genesis:....& the Lord created Man on the sixth day....) have since been put in place to prevent it happening again. But cloning is a legal fact of life in other ways: pet cloning has become a huge business, as has the cloning of human organs for transplant purposes.Prominent in the film are the ""fundamentalists"" who vehemently oppose these things and who suspect - correctly - that the featured company providing these services has secretly perfected and is practising the illegal art of human cloning.While the film's population at large believes that successful human cloning is still a myth and perhaps unachievable, the pet-cloning company owns a football team whose star player gets hugely smashed up in a scrimmage and yet shows up fresh as a daisy the following week. A fundamentalist claims to have shot dead the company's CEO, even as the fellow goes about business as usual. A congressman with a dying wife suddenly reverses his opposition to the sixth day laws.Unsuspectingly forced to navigate the epicenter of the imbroglio  - in a fantastically cool remote control helicopter-airplane - is super-pilot Arnie. He delivers trademark good-hearted monotones as he terminates (and re-terminates!)the bad guys and tries to get his life and his wife back.In Sixth Day world a featureless full-grown human body cocooned in an oversized water-held embryo is called a ""blank"". All the blank needs to replicate a human is a dose of the individual's DNA plus a recording (called ""simcording"", or something like that)of the contents of the person's mind and memory. The simcording contents can be recorded on a disk and are extracted by funky-looking eyeglass styled cameras.""And with the DNA and the simcording"", explains the nicely cast Robert Duvall to a laser gun wielding Schwarzenegger, ""we can produce a perfect clone in under two hours.""Perfect except for the built-in defects. For, you know, business and contractual leverage.....Very different to Gattaca, but if that film stimulated your thinking this probably will too.Perhaps ""The Sixth Day"" could have been marketed much more effectively. I noticed the director to be Roger Spottiswoode, who delivered ""Air America"", another film that I (think I!?) liked but nobody else seems to remember even though it features 2 fine actors in Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr.",The 6th Day
233,The Great One,One twist deserves another,6,3 December 2000,"Though this was a very good ACTION movie it still has it's downfall's. For one the basic story twist was similar to that of another sixth movie the sixth sense. All-in-all good for suspense but lacking in true depth of character(though this is not to be unexpected in an Arnold movie). With great special effects, beautiful scenery, and a good story line; this movie leaves you with one question.What kind of fuel did those Double X choppers use?",The 6th Day
234,mdboxtel,Nice movie when don't expect a thing,5,24 December 2000,"I expected very much from this movie, when I heard you can compare this movie with Total Recall, which is great movie. Well 6th day isn't half as good as Total Recall. The action is pretty basic action which you see in every movie. The only good part of the movie is that are a couple of good Schwarzenegger jokes. Overall this movie is very nice when you don't expect a good movie.",The 6th Day
235,wsponzani,Decent Action Movie,7,31 October 2000,"Saw the world premiere at the Tokyo International Film Festival (10/28/00). Schwarzenegger and Spottiswoode both spoke beforehand, and both said they're proud of the film, which had just been completed the week prior. (Arnold also commented that he'd like to be cloned because he likes himself so much, and that he could golf, be with his family, make movies, workout, etc. all at the same time.)The title comes from the biblical text in the book of Genesis stating that on the sixth day, God created man. (Notice Schwarzenegger's character's name.) As an action movie, it's decent--somewhat suspenseful (though sometimes predictable), fast chase scenes, big explosions, good special effects. The movie takes place in the undisclosed near future where human cloning has been banned, fire ball spurting weapons have replace conventional firearms, and smoking has been outlawed. The helio-jets (to coin a phrase) and the fire guns help give it its near-futuristic atmosphere and are great to see in use.The premise is a good one, and the plot follows through successfully. Schwarzenegger's character gets cloned without his knowledge.I realize that action films aren't made to make philosophical statements, but this one does banter the subject of cloning and genetic engineering about. Should humans be cloned? Should these clones be subjected to genetic engineering (for better or worse)? In the end, it's difficult to say whether the film supports these activities or not.However, it does bring to light arguments from both sides, bringing on thoughts about one's own stand on sticky ethical issues more than the average action film.It's another ""Ahnold"" movie of the ilk that usually don't do best for him. I don't think it has the draw of ""Total Recall,"" but if you've got an evening free, go see it expecting a fairly good film.",The 6th Day
236,azrail,A good Arnie but not the Best!,9,22 November 2000,"I thought this was one of Arnies better movies since he has greatly improved in acting skills since Conan. The thing this movie lacks is a unpredictable plot.  I thought the plot for this movie was quite easily predicted and had no real twist. Also the other negative I thought was the effects for the helicopters and the stunts involving the helicopters but that could be just me. I did however much in enjoy the concept of it with the cloning and the goons constantly being killed and then recloned. Also I thought the humor and action levels were just right, not to bad like in The Runnig Man with the excessive use of bad puns. Overall I gave this a 9/10. The other Arnies I thought were better are the Terminators, End of Days and the best Arnie of all True Lies.",The 6th Day
237,hustler2x4,The Sixth Day = Good movie,10,19 November 2000,"I really like the film ""the sixth day"".

238,MRT in NYC,"Work with good people, Arnold, and you'll make good movies.",6,12 December 2000,"I knew going in that this movie wouldn't be good. Why? Because at the helm is Roger Spottiswoode, creative genius behind ""Turner & Hooch"" and ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot"". Still, I held out hope...but no. Sixth Day is as dull and lifeless as I knew it would be. The action is like something out of an old Starsky and Hutch episode, and scenes are shot with very little visual style.This one ranks down there with ""The Running Man"" or ""Red Heat""...not really bad but pretty much forgettable. What Jim Cameron, Paul Verhoeven or John McTiernan could have done with this!Go back to working with A-list directors Arnold.

The plot was some what predictable but I thought it covered a lot of things the people wanted to see which is the case with most futureistic movies. I thought Tony Goldwyn played his best role ever as Michael Drucker. I'm Sure Vince McMahon and the WWE appreciated the XFL plug. The director saw the XFL as the only football league in North America and beating out the NFL. Unfortunatly for the movie, WWE and NBC, the XFL ended after one season. Sarah Wynter is actually butt naked in this PG-13 rated movie but you can only see it if you pause your DVD and zoom in.

243,lafo0045,The 6th day and the American people.,8,30 January 2005,"The 6th Day was a movie that caught the American people off guard. The subject of cloning was a topic in the year 2000 that the masses knew little about, and some of those who did know about it were simply not ready to deal with the social implications of cloning discussed in this movie. The 6th Day covered material that was just slightly ahead of its time. It is true that Arnold was a bad choice for lead, since it would have made more sense to cast someone that finds their identity through the tumultuous events in the movie instead of a character that the audience already identifies as indestructible. One day people will look back on this movie and chuckle on how the information went in one ear of America and out the other--for most anyway.",The 6th Day

The special effects are not beautiful but are nice to see. There are many twists that increase the effectiveness of the film. The acting and fantastic especially by Arnold. The makeup is perfect especially in the scenes of the laboratory and in those of cloning. One of the best films of 2000 that I've ever seen In the film there are several references to Blade Runner (such as when the psychiatrist asks the question on the turtle in the desert, or the person who claims to have cloned a snake)My verdict is 8/10 because the plot, the acting and directing is beautiful!

Arnold's last movies weren't what they once used to be and this movie wasn't as good as lets say True Lies.OK it's not your average shoot-em-up. But! After having watched this movie a couple of times (I finally understood everything...), I started to like it more and more. It has a great story, the filming is great and so are all of the actors and there are no 'boring' moments in the film.Don't judge this film by watching it only 1 time.

246,sraster,Underlying politics,1,21 November 2010,"I find it hard to believe that out of all the reviews I've seen, everyone has failed to note the pro-Republican political agenda of this movie, made on the cusp of the furor over stem-cell research. The scientific premise in this movie is extremely far fetched. It is redolent of the like knee jerk reaction to cloning that happened in the seventies when people who hadn't thought things through thought that cloning heralded the advent of evil scientists reproducing human monsters for their own sinister ends. Cloning a empty human shell is one thing - exactly reproducing an individual complete with memories and a lifetimes experiences is, even by the standards of sci-fi, preposterous. Towards the end of the movie Gibson confronts Drucker in a rather clichéd and awkwardly pasted on denouement of movies' half-baked ethical considerations, as Gibson accuses Drucker of one of the ultimate sins, of 'playing God.' But after all, Drucker is the evil scientist, a Doctor Frankenstein, a hi-tech modern day Prometheus. Even innocents like Dr Griffin Weir meet violent and untimely ends as punishment for getting caught up in this bedevilment.The movie is a undeveloped and clumsily executed propaganda job attacking the villainy of touching anything remotely human with cloning. It wearily asserts that it's OK to clone animals, but anyone who meddles with the work of the Creator is bound to meet a sticky end. With its right-wing squeamishness that holds that Bible-thumping fundamentalism is more important than the untold benefits cloning can bring to the human race, it's an odious hack job, and it stinks.",The 6th Day
