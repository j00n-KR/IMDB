0,Leofwine_draca,Thinking person's sci-fi with more ideas than dollars,9,29 May 2016,"Here's a rarity : a fresh, clever low-budget movie filmed on peanuts in Canada. Most low budget productions are just full of mindless amateur gore and poor acting skills, but this is something different. The lack of budget is hidden by some clever set-redressing so it looks like the action takes place in a huge area, when in fact it was just one room.Now I like set-ups like this - anything which differs from the norm intrigues me. CUBE starts off with an eye-opening and surreal moment, where a man is neatly sliced into hundreds of pieces, and then disintegrates. This is a gruesome yet staggeringly artistic image, executed wonderfully and a great attention grabber. Obviously things can only go downhill from there, and soon we're in the familiar territory of a bunch of actors trapped together in an isolated location. For fans of stuff like THE OUTER LIMITS and THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this is a familiar scenario. And, guess what? Each person has to use their own unique skills to help escape. There's a cop; a doctor; a student; a criminal; plus other assorted diverse characters. And from then on, we watch the gradual increase of friction between the people, the running from room to room in the seemingly endless maze, and the nail-biting moments where clever traps need to be negotiated. The best trap is the 'room of silence' one - any sound results in instant death. Classic.Okay, so the ending may be abrupt and the computer animation may be not entirely convincing, but in the end this film succeeds due to the strength of the acting. Every actor is believable, if not very interesting. It's an actor named Maurice Dean Wint who deserves all of the honours in this film. He's set up as being a straightforward action hero type, taking responsibility for control of the group, but by the end has undergone a mental breakdown which results in him murdering people to try and escape. This breakdown is gradual, and brilliantly acted, playing with the audience's expectations of who this character is.There is some other trickery involved with the viewer, too. The old standby of killing off a principal character early on (seen from everything from PSYCHO to DEEP BLUE SEA) is used here, to good effect, followed immediately by a gratuitous gore scene where a man's face is eaten away by acid. An arresting sight, I'm sure you'll agree. CUBE is full of confrontation and keeps the viewer interested throughout, making up for some out-of-place, confusing mathematics plus something of a lack of momentum in the final third, where things just don't seem as important or as urgent anymore. Saying that, it's a fine example of a cheaply-produced picture with more ideas than dollars, a rare thing these days, and films like these are just calling out to be embraced.",Cube
1,SnoopyStyle,simple Kafkaesque concept,7,27 March 2015,Alderson (Julian Richings) wakes up inside a cubic room with exits on all sides. He climbs into the next room and is killed by a trap. Policeman Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) climbs into a new cube and finds injured secretive Worth (David Hewlett) passed out. Then others join them. Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor. Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a fearful math whiz. Wrennes (Wayne Robson) is an ingenious escape artist. Nobody remembers how they got there. Leaven notices unique numbers in each cube. Wrennes gets killed. Then Leaven realizes only rooms with prime numbers are traps. They run into mentally challenged Kazan (Andrew Miller).It's such a great and simple Kafkaesque idea. There are minimal sets. The flashiness comes from the interactions. It's a good indie thriller. It's a bit pointless like the cube itself. There are some slow spots in the middle. I also wish the ending is more compelling. The numbers get more complicated and it gets harder to follow. It's still a nice little indie thriller.,Cube
2,Sleepin_Dragon,"A pretty decent watch, original too.",6,29 March 2019,"The whole idea of the Cube is such a great one, I love the concept of the room, the fact that it's a puzzle. Film making so much more creative back in the nineties, a time where films weren't just recycled stories.The characters aren't exactly what you'd call loveable, in all honesty apart from two you keep on hoping they'll just walk into a booby trapped cube.The main body of the story is good, it also has some nice tension, and some random events to keep you guessing, like new characters randomly dropping in.The ending sucked, all those crazed events, all those calculations, only to be let down by such a dreadful conclusion.It does perhaps feel a little dated, some of the effects are poor by today's standards, but considering it's from 1997, I'd recommend. 6/10",Cube
3,gavin6942,Ahead of its Time!,7,2 October 2015,"Seven complete strangers of widely varying personality characteristics are involuntarily placed in an endless Kafkaesque maze containing deadly traps.This film was a hit when it first came out. I do not recall if I saw it then or not. It seems familiar, but not enough to be certain. Regardless, it was clearly influential. Such films as ""Saw II"" used very much the same premise, though with a much smaller science fiction aspect. Was this conscious? Maybe, maybe not. But it was no doubt an influence.The weakest thing about this is how one-dimensional the characters are. The cop is as stereotypical as a cop can be, and the math geek and the Asperger's kid... but it still makes for a great story, answering just enough questions to keep you guessing.",Cube
4,lee_eisenberg,you're trapped,8,10 May 2016,"Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" has to be one of the most intriguing movies ever. Sort of a thriller spin on Jean-Paul Sartre's ""No Exit"", it features some people who mysteriously wake up in a cube-shaped room with no memory of how they got there. Each has his/her own theory about the cube (a supervillain's brainchild, the military-industrial complex) but they realize that they have to find a way out...but which way is out? The claustrophobic setting combined with the cube's Kafkaesque nature makes this one disturbing movie. The cast members were people whom I didn't recognize, so that made it seem as though this could be happening to literally anyone. I will say that some of the dialog was hackneyed, but the plot made up for that, especially the twists that they threw in.I recommend the movie. It won't be for everyone, but it does pose the question of how much we know about the world and people around us.",Cube
5,jboothmillard,Cube,6,19 October 2020,"I had heard the title of this late 90s movie a number of times, and I'm glad I found it on Amazon Prime Video to watch, I was hoping it would be worth the long time I had left it to watch, directed by Vincenzo Natali (Splice). Basically, in a mysterious cube-shaped room, a man named Alderson (Julian Richings) enters a room, only to die in a moment when he is dissected by a speeding wire trap. Five strangers, Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), Worth (David Hewlett), Holloway (Ready or Not's Nicky Guadagni), Leaven (Nicole de Boer), and Rennes (Wayne Robson) find themselves trapped in the same cube. None of them know where they are or how they got there. Quentin informs the group that from exploring he discovered some rooms contain traps. Rennes, a convict who has escaped seven prisons, there are motion detectors to trigger traps, and tests each room by throwing one of his boots inside. Frequent tremors occur whilst they are in the maze, and Leaven notices numbers inscribed in the passageways between rooms. Rennes enters a room assuming it to be safe, but he is killed sprayed in the face with acid, indicating that each room has different sensors to trigger traps. Quentin believes each person was chosen to be in the Cube: He is a divorced police officer, Leaven is a young mathematics student, and Holloway is a free clinic doctor, while Worth claims he is only an office worker. Leaven, with her maths skills, works out that any room marked with a prime number is trapped. Working their way through the rooms, they find a mentally challenged man named Kazan (Andrew Miller), whom Holloway insists they bring with them. Quentin injures his leg in a room deemed safe by Leaven's calculations, but it is trapped, and tensions rise between the strangers. After being provoked by Quentin, Worth finally admits that he designed the maze's outer shell, the gigantic cube, for a shadowy bureaucracy, but had no idea what it would be used for. Worth's knowledge of the outer shell's dimensions allows Leaven to determine that each side of the Cube is 26 rooms across and that there are 17,576 rooms in total. She then guesses that the numbers indicate coordinates. The group moves toward the next room as determined by her theory, but each of the nearest rooms are trapped. Rather than backtrack, they enter a room with a sound-activated trap, silently passing through it. After Kazan makes a sound and nearly causes Quentin's death, Quentin threatens Kazan. Holloway defends Kazan, and she and Quentin clash, with Holloway insinuating Quentin was an abusive husband. Using Leaven's theory, they reach the edge of the Cube, and Holloway scouts the darkened gap between the Cube and its outer shell. But she slips during another violent tremor; Quentin initially saves her from falling, but then deliberately lets her fall to her death. Quentin becomes mentally unhinged; he tries to persuade Leaven to join him in abandoning the others and makes sexual advances, but she rejects him. Worth intervenes, but Quentin beats him savagely and drops him into another room. There, the group finds Rennes' corpse and shaken by the fact that they have gone in a circle. Worth then realises that the rooms move periodically throughout the Cube, which explains the tremors. Leaven also deduces that traps are not tagged by prime numbers, but by powers of prime numbers, and Kazan reveals himself to be an autistic genius who does very fast mathematic sums. With Kazan's help, Leaven guides the group to the bridge room that will lead them out of the maze. Worth ambushes and seemingly kills Quentin before leaving him behind. Kazan opens the final hatch, revealing a bright white light, but Worth declines to leave the Cube as he has completely lost his will to live. As Leaven tries to convince Worth to join her, Quentin reappears, stabs, and kills Leaven with a hatch lever, and mortally wounds Worth, while Kazan walks away. As Quentin moves to kill Kazan, Worth grabs Quentin, trapping his leg between a narrow passageway where the room will shift again. Quentin is torn apart, and Worth crawls back to Leaven's corpse to die next to her. Kazan slowly wanders into the bright light, seemingly escape the Cube. This could be seen as the inspiration for something like Saw, I will be honest and say that it got complicated in moments, with all the mathematical figures and facts to try and understand, but you cannot deny that the traps and how to evade them is engaging, and the characters are reasonable, a worthwhile independent science-fiction horror. Good!",Cube
6,Woodyanders,Bang-up indie sci-fi thriller winner,9,26 February 2010,"Six complete strangers with nothing in common find themselves trapped in an intricate hi-tech maze of interconnected cubes armed with lethal booby traps. This motley group is forced to work together in order to figure a way out before they starve to death in a few days. As their situation becomes increasingly dire and desperate, the group starts to turn on each other and prove to be their own greatest enemies. Director Vincenzo Natali, who also co-wrote the ingenious, intriguing, and unpredictable script with Graeme Manson and Andre Bijelic, adroitly crafts a strong, gripping, and suspenseful shocker that's brimming with oodles of nerve-jangling claustrophobic tension, a sharp sense of amusingly cynical humor, a few nicely gross moments of nasty gore, an extremely edgy and paranoid atmosphere, and plenty of astute insights into how a crisis situation brings out both the best and the worst in human beings. Moreover, the filmmakers keep things pleasingly ambiguous throughout: We never learn who built the cube and exactly why these six people have been dumped inside it. This refreshing respect for the audience's intelligence gives this picture an extra potent and provocative edge. Kudos are also in order for the fine acting from the able ensemble cast: Nicole de Boer as perky college student mathematics whiz Leaven, Nicky Guadagni as bitter, high-strung doctor Holloway, David Hewlett as sarcastic office worker designer Worth, Andrew Miller as mentally handicapped idiot savant Kazan, Wayne Robson as wily escape artist Rennes, and, in an especially stand-out turn, Maurice Dean Wint as tough take-charge cop Quentin. Derek Rogers' agile and vertiginous cinematography makes the most out of the cramped and confined spaces. Mark Korven's shuddery score likewise does the shivery trick. Highly recommended.",Cube
7,Tweekums,Caught in a strange maze,7,29 June 2015,"This Canadian horror movie opens with a man in a strange room; before we can learn anything about him he is literally sliced and diced in a wire trap. We then get introduced our potential protagonists; Quinten, Leven, Worth, Holloway and Rennes; most of them awaken in a similar room and they are soon joined by Rennes; he has obviously been there longer and explains what he knows to them and us. They are in what appears to be a giant maze made of interconnecting rooms, some of which are booby-trapped. He believes he has found a way to detect the traps; throwing a boot into the room sets of the sensors that trigger the traps. Unfortunately for him not all the sensors are the same and he is soon killed leaving the others to figure out a way to identify the trapped rooms. Leven believes that they are indicated by the code numbers on the entrance hatches to each room; of course it isn't quite as obvious as it first appears. As they travel through the rooms, tempers fray and they learn more about each other and the structure they are caught in; one of them designed the outer casing, for reasons he didn't know, so they know it is a cube. They also meet another person, the autistic Kazan. As tensions rise it becomes clear that it isn't only the traps they have to worry about; one of them will do anything to make sure they get out, including murder.The strength of this film is that we know so little about why these people have been placed in this strange maze and nothing about why it was built in the first place. It becomes apparent that each of them has skills that could prove useful; but why them and not someone with similar skills isn't answered. It is this that makes the set up creepy; if we knew who built the cube or why it wouldn't be as effective; all we need to know is that somebody had it built and now these people are caught in it. The cast of less well-known actors does a solid enough job portraying the varied reactions of their characters to the situation they are in. The use of different colours for the rooms nicely creates the idea that they really are in a huge maze of room rather than filming in a single room where the colours could be changed. The opening scene brilliantly grabs our attention and tells us just how dangerous the place is and the tension is maintained nicely almost until the end; then things get a bit too melodramatic as it becomes clear that one of them is very dangerous we even get the cliché of the bad guy, who we thought had been lost or killed, appearing again at the last moment to attack the survivors just as they are about to escape rather than getting out of the cube with them. Overall an enjoyable and creative horror film let down by the ending.",Cube
8,BA_Harrison,Tension squared.,8,17 May 2019,"Ignoring the highly unlikely probability of six people placed in separate cubes somehow safely converging, despite there being countless possible routes for them to take (with many booby trapped rooms along the way), the script for Cube is taut, smartly-written and engaging, primarily a well-observed study of human nature, but also an original little sci-fi thriller, the premise of which predates the similarly themed Saw movies by quite a few years.Not knowing how they got there, the film's six disparate characters (a schoolgirl, a doctor, a criminal, a mentally disabled man, a cop and an architect) try to find a way out of their unusual predicament, but as time goes by, nerves begin to fray and tempers flare, resulting in a fight for survival. Decent performances from the minimal cast help the film to hold one's attention, even when the focus shifts from creative death scenes (cheese wire and acid traps result in some neat gore) to more psychological horror.I can understand how the ambiguous ending of the film might be deemed a disappointment by some, but I like how the nature and purpose of the cube remains a mystery.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Cube
9,moonspinner55,Not for claustrophobics...,4,12 November 2017,"Three men and two women of varying backgrounds find themselves inexplicably trapped inside a linked series of color-coordinated, numerically-labeled, most often booby-trapped cubicles, but how did they get there and how do they get out? Canadian thriller of survival from director Vincenzo Natali and screenwriters Andre Bijelic, Vincenzo Natali and Graeme Manson might have made the perfect short; alas, at 90 minutes, there seems to be no escape from a strenuous situation which eventually becomes tedious. The violence is on the gruesome side, while the personal arguments that erupt between the characters are not very enlightening or engaging. Simplistically, this group represents a microcosm of humanity at large and how duress breaks down the human condition to its animalistic basics. On the loftier side, the scenario might be a representation of Heaven and Hell. However, as ambitious as something like this is for a suspense movie, it won't sustain most audiences to the finish line. It provides coldly-served food for thought without allowing for cinematic attributes like mystery or excitement--or a satisfying denouement. Followed by two sequels. ** from ****",Cube
10,dbdumonteil,"Where"" pi ""fails,""cube"" succeeds.",7,29 March 2002,"Word to the wise:I urge the people who enjoyed ""cube"" to try to see the made-for-TV British ""A child's play"",(1985)part of the series ""Hammer house of suspense and mystery"" starring the late Nicholas Clay.In spite of a very poor(and unfair) rating,it's really worthwhile and the connection with ""cube"" is glaring,even if the Val Guest TV film has a ""rational"" explanation.As people have pointed out,a movie does not need a rational solution to be enthralling.if such was the case,""2001 "" and ""the birds"" ,to name but two,would not be world-wide favorites .And ""cube' is brimming with originality,and like the two mentioned movies,it may have as many interpretations as there are potential commenting users.Visually ,the movie is a splendor,all shrouded in red and orange light,glorifying geometry and arithmetic:this is really the mathematical movie which ""pi"" wasn't:prime numbers and the Descartes analytical geometry are shrewdly introduced in the plot.All that remains is mathematics when a world has lost its way,morally and psychologically.And even mathematic lets you down when you meet human stupidity,as the young ""numbers"" girl will discover.Only a lunatic can survive in such a world.He does.",Cube
11,Quinoa1984,the existence and escape of an inescapable prism - one of the smartest sci-fi/horror films of the 90s,10,2 August 2009,"A fully realized but perfectly mysterious environment is created in Cube. It's a system that is hard to fathom, an intricate one but seemingly simple with the use of mathematics, but the human element, really, is the thing that keeps the characters not able, until the last fifteen minutes, to really get themselves together and get out of this 'place' that may have been created by humans or aliens or even cyborgs, or nobody at all.Cube is a great film about people with their own 'personalities'; it's appropriate, and a sweet touch, to have the opening title to homage Ridley Scott's Alien, as it's about a group of people thrust together who get picked off one by one in a claustrophobic environment. Only this time, with its set-up like the beginning of a new life itself, and the people each reflecting a stand-point that can help, damage or be neutral to the chances of escape, there's no one real ""villain"" except each other.Vincenzo Natali takes the audience by the brain and doesn't let go - not the balls, mind you, though if he wants those he can get them from time to time. This is about as close to a science fiction 'No Exit', or a translation of ideas from multiple philosophers like Nietzsche and Descartes (the latter name-dropped in the film and used as a basis for mathematics), but as 'brainy' science fiction it doesn't kid those looking for just a pulse-pounding horror film either. And for anyone wanting to compare this to Saw, by the way, break it down this simply: Cube is smart, Saw is stupid. Saw starts with a semi-clever premise and shatters it with shoddy and ludicrous storytelling and characters that no one can care about. In Cube, it's just so bizarre and mechanically inspired a set-up that the characters have to be rich to keep things interesting - and they really are.Cube will make you think while it has scenes of sensationalized killings, but they're not very rampant or frequent, and rely on what we know is going to happen and taking time with the scene- or just springing the unexpected trap. The opening scene, for example, is a staggering example of taking an audience right off its feet, much like when one first sees the chest-burster in Alien; when the guy goes into the room, and we think we hear or see something *swipe* downward, only to suddenly notice that the man's entire body has been sliced into a dozen pieces, it slowly dawns on us what is going on - and if your jaw doesn't drop at that, I don't what to do for you. Or, on top of this, good old fashioned suspense with the group of guys and gals going downward into the room that can be triggered by a single voice-sound.If there's any one minor flaw it could be that a couple of the performances needed some tweaking, or perhaps went a little 'too much' in their intended paths. These two I mean Maurice Dean Witt as Quentin, the cop who with one or two little exceptions is in the same mode (ANGRY/PERPLEXED black dude) in the entire running time, and the actor Andrew Miller playing Kazan. Aside from that, the performances are quite amazing, and the characteristics of the actors make these characters fit into this warped situation all the better. And the script itself is terrific, its lines of dialog always important line-to-line be it something descriptive about one of the people or that sobering 'confession' from Holloway about designing part of the outside but still having no idea what this *is*.But at the end, you'll remember Cube the most for putting you in an unfamiliar world with the most familiar types you wouldn't (or would) want to be around in a situation like this. It's not simply about figuring out a puzzle or a game like some BS Saw-movie contraption. It's about morality and choices and the nature of construction of the mind and the soul. Deep stuff that entertains and attracts one in despite its closed-quarters and potential for being 'stagey'. an",Cube
12,Coventry,Living In A Box.,6,26 April 2006,"Okay, I agree with the majority of people around here in thinking that ""Cube"" is a fairly intelligent and well-constructed Sci-Fi thriller, but did it REALLY deserve all the hype and exceptionally high ratings it received? Basically, it's only the conceptual design and claustrophobic atmosphere that are unique here, while the evolution of the characters and their behavior certainly isn't new. ""Cube"" is not the first film that gathers different and seemly-unrelated characters in an unusual setting where it quickly becomes clear that not the location but their own personal difficulties and the urge for survival form the biggest danger. That's just stating the obvious. Force people to cooperate and depend on each other and bad things WILL happen, especially if the situation is life threatening. The whole success of reality-TV shows like ""Big Brother"" is based on this concept! So by now you already know that the story of ""Cube"" revolves on a group of people that wake up and find themselves trapped in a peculiar location. Six people, to be exact, with different backgrounds and occupations (a math student, a cop, a shrink, an architect, an autistic boy and a criminal) have to find their way out of a mathematical construction stuffed with codes and booby traps. Naturally, they're disorientated Unaware of what they possibly could have done to deserve this test or who's the evil mastermind behind this. ""Cube"" is a powerful motion picture with a truckload of tension, eeriness and ingenious camera-tricks. The budget obviously was very limited, but talented director like Vincenzo Natali largely compensates this by using simple eye-candy (the disturbing color shades!) and implementing psychological terror. Personally, I didn't understand one iota of all the mathematical mumbo-jumbo, but it was fascinating to listen to and it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. Often read criticism goes out to the acting performances, but I thought they were very adequate, especially considering the faces were unfamiliar. Don't get your hopes up for a genuine and old-fashioned shock ending, though.",Cube

14,hitchcockthelegend,Perilous Pythagoras Puzzle.,9,4 October 2009,"Seven strangers awake in a cubical maze, each with a different attribute that may or may not hold the key to getting out alive. For this maze is rigged with deathly traps, one wrong move or sound can bring a horrible death. They must work together or face the consequence, but why are they here? And just what is this point of this highly built construction?.We open with a quite brilliant scene that ranks up with the best of horror moments from the 1990s. We are introduced to the Cube and its intricate perils, it's the only set we are going to see for the next 90 minutes. Our characters start filtering thru, each of different social standing, and each with a surname linked to famous prisons. They argue about their reasons for being there, throwing up ideas on why someone has selected them for this atrocious ""game"" and who may be watching them. What we do know, is that it's us that is watching them, we are privy to human beings acting like ""rats in a fiendish maze"".I would suggest any prospective newcomer to Cube do little to no research prior to viewing it. Knowing little can surely only enhance the experience. Not in anyway hindered by a marginal budget, and benefiting greatly from having a cast of unknowns fill out the piece. Cube is an intelligent, yes horrific at times, voyeuristic gem of a movie. The mystery element holds tight right the way thru, the characters get more interesting with each frame and the outcome does not annoy like so many other genre pieces have over the years. Co-written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, the film has gained a massive cult following since it's late 90s release. And rightly so. For this is excellent thought provoking stuff. The kind the genre could do with far more often. 9/10",Cube
15,Theo Robertson,Nowhere As Clever As It Thinks It Is,6,26 November 2014,"This got a lot of critical acclaim on its release . A very low budget Canadian thriller whose premise is a group of strangers wake up and find themselves trapped in a maze of rooms and right away the audience are asking themselves the important questions . Who are these people ? Why are they there ? What is this structure they're trapped in ? Who ? Why ? What ? and Where ? It's also good that the producers keep faith in the premise . All the on screen action takes place in the confined structure but this is probably down to budget limitations rather than creative decisions but that's not a criticism . What might be a problem is that is convincing the audience that this is possible in real life and not having the audience asking questions that will destroy the illusionI'm afraid that's where the film falls down to a large degree . Don't get me wrong I did enjoy this film for the most part but a few things did annoy me ? I take it the revelation that there's almost 18,000 rooms isn't true ? I mean having something like that would be impossible to keep secret , especially if the rooms themselves are able to move . Fair enough I was puzzled by two whys ? If you're going to trap people in what is effectively a giant puzzle box why fill it with people who have the ability to think ( Pun alert ) outside the box ? The other why is why would someone go to all the trouble to doing this in the first place ? In other words the scenario seems to exist merely to set up the premise for a movie with no logic beyond that . It's also a film that offers no explanations which makes for a frustrating ending that has little in the way of pay off",Cube
16,Hey_Sweden,Amazingly intense and ingenious thriller.,8,29 February 2012,"Co-writer Vincenzo Natali's movie is one of those that achieves that beautiful combination of being both intelligent and visceral. Natali maintains an uneasy tension the entire time as we follow a limited number of characters through an insane situation. These are strangers that have been gathered for some unknown purpose in a structure that, it turns out, is comprised of a seemingly never ending series of gloomy rooms, some of which come equipped with truly sadistic booby traps. Unfortunately, the characters realize how hard it will be to rely on each other as they struggle to think their way through the maze. Not only does this movie provide some grim and gruesome thrills (and work as something of a forerunner to the ""Saw"" franchise), but it's an all too believable study of the dark side of human nature, the ""masks"" that people can wear, and the danger of ignorance when people don't bother to ask questions. Natali and co-screenwriters Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson keep things nicely ambiguous as to why and how this group of people came to be there, never bothering to answer very many questions themselves. They also do a fine, fine job of keeping things mostly unpredictable, not killing off certain characters when we think they will, and using both script and performance to have the audience eventually realize that we had some of the characters wrong. There are also delicious jolts along the way in terms of gore, as one character is diced right at the beginning, and another gets their face melted right down. The design of the movie is absolutely incredible, with the various rooms enhanced by various lighting schemes; the wonderful production design is by Jasna Stefanovic, the art direction by Diana Magnus, and the cinematography by Derek Rogers. The music by Mark Korven is effectively sinister without ever becoming too intrusive. The acting is solid, with Nicole de Boer playing Leaven, the math expert who's the most likable of them all, the commanding Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, David Hewlett (who also worked with Natali on ""Splice"") as the cagey, cynical Worth, Nicky Guadagni as the nervous Holloway, Andrew Miller as idiot savant Kazan, Wayne Robson as a former jailbird, Rennes, now trapped in another kind of prison, and the briefly seen Julian Richings as Alderson. Horror and thriller fans tired of movies with the same old, same old types of stories are advised to check out the creepy ""Cube"", a movie that holds interest right up until its decidedly grim resolution.

17,preppy-3,Great sci-fi premise but...,4,5 March 2003,not enough for a 90 minute film.Five people find themselves trapped in a giant cube and try to find a way out through adjornying cubes...but some contain death traps.This would make a real good 45 minute feature but this is dragged out to twice that length.  The characters are pretty unlikable and it gets repititous and downright boring at times.  Good acting by everybody helps but only to a certain degree.  Lousy ending too.Don't bother.,Cube
18,LeonLouisRicci,Study Your Math...The Universal Language,3,12 January 2013,An Anemic attempt at a Profound Story and a Cool Concept. The whole thing is Forgettable and that is Unforgivable. It manages to Insult and Irritate and has an Ending that is Lazy and is a Realization that there was Nothing there. The Acting and the Dialog are Below any Expectations of at least competency.To say that this is Pretentious would mean that there was a Pretense worth Presenting. It seems as though this was a Bloated Effort at being Profound and Ground Breaking but the only break here is the Inability to Suspend oneself from the Disbelief.There is one Neat Design and for a Low Budget it has a Gleaming Look that would be an Interesting Modern Photographic Template but this is all We get for the Duration.

19,poolandrews,"Brilliant, absorbing & ingenious horror thriller.",9,27 December 2005,"Cube starts with a man named Alderson (Julian Richings) waking up in a square 14'x14' room with strangely decorated panels on the walls from which a white light shines through, he notices six hatches one on each wall, the ceiling & floor. Alderson opens one & enters the joining room which is exactly the same as the one he came from except a different colour light is shining through the translucent panels, inside he sets off a bobby trap that slices him into little pieces using razor wire... Six complete stranger's find themselves placed in similar cubes, a young maths student named Joan Leaven (Nicole de Boer), an architect David Worth (David Hewlett), a cop named Quentin (Mauruce Dean Wint), a doctor named Helen Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), an autistic boy Kazan (Andrew Miller) & an escaped convict Rennes (Wayne Robson). Each cube leads into another, some of which contain deadly traps while other's are perfectly safe, they have no food or water, no equipment & have no knowledge of the cube itself or why they are there. The six must try to work together & discover the secret of the cube & find a way out or die trying...This Canadian production was co-written & directed by Vincenzo Natali & is a simple yet superb film, I loved it. The script by Natali, Andre Bijelic & Graeme Manson is just so brilliant in it's simplicity. Who would have thought a film set almost entirely in various cube rooms that look exactly the same could be so gripping, engaging & so entertaining. The idea is just ingenious & Cube is really original & unique which is a hard trait to come by these days in films. The character's their emotions & personal struggles are very well written & developed & we really get to know each of them without long boring dialogue scenes. The film works wonderfully well & I was as puzzled as the character's on screen as they try to find a way out & I liked the idea that each one had a certain ability that needed to be found & utilised. Nothing in Cube is explained to any real degree of satisfaction which may annoy some people but I found the unanswered questions & mystery surrounding the cube added another layer to an already great film. On the negative side it can get a bit samey being set in exactly the same room for 90 odd minutes, I can't see many repeat viewings & the ending was maybe a bit too downbeat.Director Natali can't really do much to spruce things up since Cube is set in a single location although flashy camera work & CGI effect's isn't what Cube is about. He does manage to create terrific tension & atmosphere, I almost felt like I was there with them at times! There isn't much gore, someone is sliced into cubes & falls apart, someone has their face burned off with acid & there are a couple of stabbings.With a low budget Cube was shot entirely in one single 14'x14' room in which the lighting was changed to signify the different rooms. Technically Cube is fine with decent special effects & production values but the very nature of the film doesn't give much scope for variety. The acting is very strong by all involved & did you notice the relevance of the character's last names? They are all named after real prisons, Quentin is named after San Quentin in California, Holloway is a prison in England, Kazan in Russia, Rennes in France, Alderson in West Virginia while Leaven & Worth are obviously both taken from Leavenworth in Kansas. So now you know.I think Cube is a fantastic film that everyone should watch at least once, it's very clever, original, mysterious & totally gripping. I absolutely loved it. Followed by a sequel Cube 2: Hypercube (2002) & a prequel Cube Zero (2004) but I doubt either of them are as good.",Cube

Sounds like questions all of us who are trapped in a cubical life ask every day. These are some of the same questions being asked by a group in a fantastic cube, where a mistake in a decision can cost you your life.Worth (David Hewlett) had it down. We are so concerned with our pathetic little lives that we fail to see the big picture. That allows others to manipulate and control us. It's not a conspiracy; it's just that we have ceased to care. Nature abhors a vacuum, so someone will take control while we look the other way.Kazan (Andrew Miller) is autistic, and shows how we tend to dismiss the less fortunate when it suits us.The cop Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) and the social worker Halloway (Nicky Guadagni) showed the opposite sides of the debate over what our society values - people or order.Those are just my observations, and I am sure others will make their own interpretations.

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Original,8,22 January 2010,"While not perfect, this is an amazing film. This is what you get when people with enthusiasm and a new concept get the opportunity to put something together. With few exceptions, this abandons all clichés. The ambiguity is astonishing, and this could be viewed as a metaphor for any number of things. This uses the audience's imagination in a way too seldom seen since the likes of Hitchcock. While the acting(apart from some shining moments and the performance of Hewlett) is not all great(and when you take into consideration how little they had to work with, they're not bad), the characters are incredibly well-written, credible and varied. The horror is almost purely psychological, and the personalities and humanity is also the source of the drama. Dialog has occasional blunders of lines, but beyond that, it's natural, with depth and even philosophy that is delivered without being preachy or pretentious. The mood and atmosphere, gritty, dark, paranoid and claustrophobic, has been imitated, not matched, since the release of this. There is an underlying tension throughout this, and it is immensely exciting. It breaks up the suspense with light-hearted bits here and there, and this walks that balance beautifully. FX are sufficiently well-done, and they are used as a tool, never taking over. The editing and cinematography are nicely done, at times experimental, and at no point flashy. This is about subtlety and, save for the traps, simplicity, and yet it is rather creative and different. The sound design is well-done, and the music is minimalistic, both as far composition and use. This is not for everyone. It is not straightforward, Hollywood or mainstream. The ending, or a portion of it, is potentially a letdown to an extent. With a running time of about 90 minutes, this is not so long that the setting grates on your nerves. There is infrequent strong language, a tad of sexual material, a lot of disturbing content and a limited amount of blood, violence and gore in this. The DVD comes with an interesting and fun commentary track by the director, one of the writers and one actor, David, three really short deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer and photo galleries with storyboards and production art. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good, scary, mysterious science fiction. 8/10",Cube

This was a movie that movies such as ""Circle"" imitate but cannot duplicate.Seven strangers wake up in a foreign place wearing prison uniforms with their last names on them. They're in cube shaped rooms that have six doors to other like rooms but not all rooms are safe to go to. They must put all of their skill sets together in order to find a way out.The story was great even if the acting was so-so. The acting wouldn't have been half bad if it weren't for Maurice Dean Wint who played Quentin. He was so exaggerated with his speech and facial expressions that it became, at worst, a parody and at least obnoxious. He talked in a Christian Bale Batman voice without the benefit of a mask and the need to hide his identity. He also frequently showed the whites of his eyes just to clearly signal he was in fact crazy.The other characters were tame in comparison and far more likable if not believable. Having an unlikable character is no cinematic crime, but having a caricature is.Still the movie was great. The cube was the mother of all math problems with life or death consequences.

Granted I saw it on the Sci-fi channel so maybe all the commercial breaks had a hand to play in how I feel about this movie. I thought it started out with a bang, person in a strange room checks out his surrounds goes into another room and instantly gets shredded. Suffice to say I was compelled to watch after that. Then a group of strangers gets together in one of the rooms and begin to work together to find a way out and to figure out just what this strange labyrinth is designed by or who made it. It is good for about the first thirty to forty minutes as we see a variety of traps take out a member and other traps our crew must avoid. At the end though there is just to much in fighting for my tastes as one of the party gets a tad to paranoid. So the rest of the movie the traps are virtually ignored and we are left with people who have the key to getting out spending all their time literally trying to kill each other. So there ya, the paranoia and such takes center stage and the cool traps which caught my attention in the first place are gone. Still I can see how you need something else to bring to the table as you need more plot than just trap room, death, and this and that...I think this would have been better served as a forty five minute short rather than full length movie.

Alderson didn't know what hit him, and I wonder if even for a few seconds he was alive after being sliced and diced unexpectedly? Anyway, maybe there should be a prequel which deals with the Alderson backstory. Kind of like Cube: Rogue One or something like that.",Cube
28,The_Void,`It restores your faith in science fiction to see a movie as original and successful as this',8,21 October 2003,"Ignore the title, I was being sarcastic.If this were the movie that restores faith in science fiction, I'd hate to have to watch the film that took the faith away. (It was probably The Matrix..)`Six strangers awaken from their daily lives to find themselves trapped in a surreal prison' No, no, no, this is all screwed up. I think what they meant was `Six terrible actors wake up in what looks like a set from a low budget 80's Sci Fi Star Trek wannabe filled with very unimaginative traps and a whole host of other crapness'The whole film takes place in `The cube', that fact gives the film a crappy low budget edge right from the offset. The first scene depicts a man in a room, getting sliced and diced by what looks like a big metal cargo net or something. Sound good? Forget it, I never thought I'd say this but, Resident Evil did the laser scene better. The movie then moves on to the main characters meeting each other, and within about ten minutes another one is on the floor, this time it was an acid thing that burnt his face off. At this point I thought the movie was looking up, I mean 2 deaths in ten minutes? Surely all the rest of them are going to die in shocking and exotic ways..A film such as this is a playground for great set piece death scenes, every room could hold a new secret, a new grizzly and gruesome death, what a wasted opportunity.Which brings me to the script, the word `rubbish' just doesn't do it justice, there are lots of words I could use, mediocre, silly, unbelievable, ridiculous etc but none of them are mean enough. Seriously, we need a new word to describe the script, when you've got characters saying, `look! It's the Renne', you know something is wrong.Now, the Japanese may like films where nothing is explained, but guess what? I don't. Where did the cube come from? Why were those people put in it? Where is it? How come this film sucks so much? So many questions.the characters throw a few theories around, such as `The government built it' `Aliens!' `It was an independent person', `the baddie from a James Bond film made it' (no, I didn't just make that one up) But what does that prove? Nothing.This film tries to be clever, with its underlying `morality' theme, apparently the cube is an extreme of life, being forced to interact with others that you don't necessarily want to interact with in a hostile environment, this is shown by the paranoia the characters fall into due to their situation, well actually one character feels the effects, and he just turns into a stupid lunatic that ends up wasting two potential death scenes. Morality and metaphorical issues? No thanks, lets have a good film instead.Which brings me to the ending, I can imagine the directors sat there now `come on, hurry up, my dinner's nearly ready, just throw anything together and lets get it shipped out!' The ending is a close contender for the worst of all time, up there with The fast and the furious. I mean anti climatic is an understatement, and the only likable character (the maths wiz) got killed and the worst character (the retard) survived! What were they thinking? Well, actually we don't even know if he did survive, as all he did was walk into a big white blur.In short, do yourself a favour and give it a miss. If they had a few more ideas than just spikes and acid, it could have been great. The idea is there, but it suffered from poor execution. This is one film I would like to see remade.",Cube

If only they would give you an explanation then maybe it could have scored a bit more for me. But without any explanation on many questions it's just not worth to watch. I've never been a big fan of mathematics at school, neither a big fan of resolving a Rubik's cube, so add those things together and you get why I think this movie is a bit boring. And on top of that you have the acting. Most of them are just average, but Maurice Dean Wint, he's just terrible to watch. I found his acting so amateuristic it was painful to watch. I've been fooled by the high ratings again. This is not Sci-Fi at it's best like some wants to make us believe, it's just below average. And it's not a question of a low budget.

30,Red-Barracuda,A clever example of low-budget sci-fi,7,23 May 2018,"I guess you would have to classify this Canadian film as an example of how to intelligently make a low budget science fiction film. All too often cheap sci-fi movies end up falling under the bracket of film which can best be described as 'corridors in space' movies, i.e. lots of scenes of people running (and walking) up and down corridors (of the future). These movies are almost always deeply tedious, at least partially on account of their limited settings. What Cube cleverly does is use this handicap to its advantage, where the limited location is also kind of the point of the entire movie and part of its overall suspense generator. A group of people wake up and find themselves in a high-tech maze made up of giant inter-connecting cube shaped rooms; some cubes having deadly hidden traps situated in them. It is an imaginative and original idea for its time and it sure makes the most of limited budget by using its sets in this way.What it all boils down to is a puzzle movie where we follow a bunch of people trying to work out how they got where they are. It has the good sense to remain pretty enigmatic in many respects and not explain everything, and realising that it is often the questions which are more interesting than the answers. While there are a few memorably gory moments, the approach is very much more psychological and all the better for it. It is not a perfect film, as it suffers from some weak performances and the setting does - slightly - suffer from over-familiarity to at least some degree. But, on the whole, this is a commendably original bit of low budget sci-fi which deserves its cult status.",Cube
31,disdressed12,"a template for ""Saw""?",6,21 October 2006,"Cube is an example of minimalist film-making at its best.this movie may have been the template for ""Saw"".the plot is very simple.basically,a group of people find themselves in a labyrinthine maze full of rooms,many of which are filled with lethal traps.the group must then try to to survive and find a way out.there is an interesting group dynamic going on as each person reacts differently to their predicament,each offering their own ideas of why they are there and how to escape. naturally paranoia sets in affecting each person differently,with conspiracy theories abounding.the acting performances are solid.however,there is never any clear reason given as to why these people are there,and who or what may be behind it all. this is the only complaint i have of this movie.it would have been nice to know the purpose of it all and the motivation behind it. this a minor complaint though.this a very thought provoking film,which does not rely heavily on special effects,or gore,though there are two gruesome scenes.this is more of a study of psychology and human relations.it is a very low key movie,which works in its favor. 6* out of 10",Cube
32,sddavis63,"A Good Study Of Group Dynamics, But It Lacks Any Real Resolution",6,2 December 2010,"This movie is really more about group dynamics than science fiction, and it offers a pretty good portrayal of the dynamics of one particular group of people who find themselves caught up in an insane situation and have to learn to work together if they want to have any hope of escape. Everything about this is pretty simple - except for the solution of course. There are no big name actors, the story and the dilemma is straightforward, the sets are very basic. Basically you have six characters who without either explanation for the viewer or understanding for them awaken in a room that's essentially a cube. Upon exploring, they discover that the room leads only to other rooms shaped like cubes (some of which are booby trapped) and they finally realize that all these ""cube rooms"" are located inside what must be a gigantic cube. The challenge is to find a way out or die of starvation, because there is no food. Each of the characters seems to have a particular gift or talent that might be useful in finding a way out but that also leads to competitiveness and jealousy as the various characters vie for control.It's interesting to watch the group as it evolves. Starting as strangers who are suspicious of each other, they manage to meld themselves into a reasonably cohesive group, but as the situation grows more desperate that cohesiveness disappears, and they begin to descend into less and less civilized behaviour. All that is well portrayed and quite believable in the circumstances.The ending of this was disappointing to me. There was no real closure; no explanation at all of what this cube structure was or how these people were taken to it. Personally, I found that a bit unsatisfying. I suppose that leaves everything to the interpretation of the viewer. Were I to take a guess, I'd guess that these folks were like rats in a maze. They were placed there so somebody somewhere could see how they dealt with the situation. To me, that lends itself to a sense that somehow the viewer is supposed to buy into the ""alien"" theory, since there would really be no need for humans to study group dynamics in such a complex and mystifying way. But that's just a guess on my part.",Cube
33,thesar-2,Cubed,8,7 March 2010,"In the pre-Saw independent days of 1998 (actually, released outside of the USA in 1997) was a wildly original and inventive film called Cube. I saw this many years ago and loved it. However, after rewatching it, I feel it definitely deserves a solid eight out of ten stars.Why it lost the full 2 stars (I originally gave it) to drop it to four was just two factors: serious overacting at times and the most depressing finale. No, I won't spoil the climax, per se, but you're grasping throughout the movie for an ounce of hope and need something to pick you up. The rug's pulled, so in a sense, you fall instead of rise.That said, and despite the size of the set the actors are all-but exclusively in, I loved the camera work/cinematography. Unlike Saw with its flashbacks – I think total now 900,000 from the first movie to date (Part VI), this movie shot in the metal rooms had to be a challenge. They did a great job. Also, I love puzzles, and this movie is full of them. Finally, (despite the sequels) I loved not knowing the big picture – I.E. how the characters came here, who built the place. This placed you in more tension like the cast.Several men and women awake in a puzzle of identical ""cubes"" or perfect metallic, square rooms, each side (including floor and ceiling) contains a portal to the next, seemingly similar dungeon. But, beware! There are traps abroad and it's these somewhat unrelated and unwilling participants must decipher a way out, room by room. And they must work together to achieve freedom as they start dying off one by one, each in a new and inventively gruesome manner. (I.E. the Saw reference. Saw's writers Leigh Whannell and James Wan must have got a lot of ideas from watching Cube.) As much as the movie contains suspense in spades, I am super glad they decided not to continue the movie past 90 minutes. It's obviously a two set movie (two cubes built side by side) and though they added depth to the characters, they really could only take this so far.For lovers of suspense, claustrophobic horror, character study, numbers (you'll have to refresh on your math skills before or after) and small, indie films with quality, I would highly recommend this movie.",Cube
34,gridoon,Unique but ultimately unsatisfying.,6,18 January 2000,"""Cube"" is certainly a unique movie. The brilliant, absolutely irresistible premise grabs you instantly, and the production design keeps you impressed. The first hour of this picture was thoroughly engrossing and full of surprises; I would even call it ""astonishing"" if the actors didn't deliver some obviously forced, unnaturally ""profound"" speeches, and if the director didn't try to create dramatic moments by taking the easy way out - having the characters argue with each other all the time; if they acted as a team and tried to overlook their differences, THAT would have been the REALLY original approach. Still, the movie was fast-paced and fully engrossing.And then, about 20 minutes before the end, it begins to collapse! The mathematical calculations become IMPOSSIBLE to decipher and follow. A major character changes his behavior completely. And the ending is a real disappointment. Some people have said it's ""surprising""; I think it's a total cop-out. It doesn't provide any explanations, and it doesn't provide any clues for us to try to figure it out on our own. I watched the last five minutes three times. They leave you with an intense ""THAT'S IT?"" feeling.Overall, this movie is definitely worth seeing, and the acting isn't nearly as bad as most people say, but be prepared for a HIGHLY unsatisfying ending. 6/10.",Cube

36,Robert_duder,"Riveting, odd, complex, out of the ordinary!!",8,11 August 2005,"Cube is perhaps one of the most unique films I have seen in a long time. Part of it's charm is that it has a very amateur film type quality to it. The story is very simple, and the cast very small and the setting so simplistic that to keep this film interesting would be such an enormous challenge and the fact that director and co-writer Vincenzo Natali pulled that off is a representation to how great a director he could be.Cube is never dull, and never slows down, and keeps you on the edge of your seat despite it's setting and small cast. The entire film takes place in various rooms, all basically the same, but different colors inside a much larger Cube, so they believe. Seven strangers find themselves locked into this maze of rooms and mechanisms and doors for no reason and seemingly no point. Each character discovers they have a different purpose for being there, a fate or destiny. The whole cast does a great job showing a variety of emotions particularly lead actor Maurice Dean Wint who plays the anti-hero/bad guy Quentin. He seems to be the sane reasonable one but by the end is the horribly crazed psychotic killer. It shows his downward spiral into insanity while being trapped in these spaces. The rest of the cast is no less great in their perspective roles. I was disappointed to see brilliant character actor Wayne Robson get killed off so early in the film. He has been around for such a long time and seemed to have such an interesting character but barely lasted any amount of time, although his death was very cool!! In fact the film is quite gory and the enormous variety of traps set in different rooms also gives you a serious sense of suspense and on the edge of your seat. The special effects are quite stunning considering such a low budget film. Cube brings out the fears in the human mind and each character shows a different range of emotions caused by this situation and setting. This makes the film very riveting and impossible not to watch. Unfortunately the film does leave you more than slightly unsatisfied with no real answer to any of the major questions. The plot really never thickens and never has a climax or an end. I hope that perhaps the following sequels to the film tie up some of that but by the sounds of it they really don't. They created something incredibly unique with this film and it's worth seeing just to see something completely out of the norm but still very compelling. I just think there was more story there to tell definitely. Check it out!! 8.5/10",Cube
37,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Slice and dice.,7,7 July 2021,"This insular horror/thriller makes excellent use of a single set to convey a much larger space, with each individual room combining to make a massive, deadly maze. After a cold open punctuated by a shocking moment of well-realised gore, 'Cube (1997)' focuses on a group of six individuals who must work together to figure out a way to escape from their current confinement. With a seemingly endless array of rooms, some of which are rigged with sadistic booby traps, and no form of nourishment, the group soon start to fall victim to fatigue and frustration. It's only a matter of time before someone cracks. Despite its clearly low budget and its amateur actors, the movie is a rather successful exercise in suspense and surprise. It features a number of rather inspired twists and turns, especially when it comes to what - or who - is actually an antagonist, and there are several edge-of-your-seat sequences that keep you engaged with the occasionally repetitive plot. Though some of their development is rather rushed and, as such, a tad unbelievable, the characters are all compelling in their own ways and carry the flick as an ensemble (there's no clear protagonist, at least not consistently). The most major problem with the picture is its often unconvincing acting, as it sometimes makes proceedings seem a bit camp and, therefore, contrary to the tone that's being aimed for. Still, most of it is at least passable and it can be overlooked thanks the the piece's proficiency in other departments. Overall, it's an enjoyable and engaging experience that makes good use of its limited budget and has an unexpected but welcome element of allegory to it. 7/10.",Cube
38,bowmanblue,Good horror doesn't need a big budget,10,17 April 2019,"From what I can tell of the other online reviews for 'Cube,' it's one of those films that you'll either love or hate. Personally, I absolutely loved it from the first time I saw it and have subsequently seen it many times since. I guess I can understand people not really getting behind it. It's hardly a rollercoaster or a thrill ride with hordes of brilliantly computer-generated monsters ripping people apart. Although it is pretty horrific - you just have to think it through.Six strangers wake up inside, what is technically, one giant Rubik's Cube. However, this one doesn't just take half your life getting one piece of blue square out of an entire side of red - this one has lethal traps inside which can do anything from melt your face, to completely dicing you all together. How did they get there? They don't know. All they know is that there's no food or water on hand, therefore they better figure out how to get out of there before they starve to death (and so rob the traps of the honour of killing them).And that's about it. It's a simple (and highly condensed/claustrophobic) little tale with no real major set-pieces (the cube is technically the same one room, endlessly repeated - only in different colours), no recognisable stars, few special effects and - possibly most importantly - few (if any!) answers to the questions raised.Like I say, I personally love it. I find it as tense now as I did when I first watched it (even though I know what happens to everyone!). Yes, I know the lack of 'star-power' does actually mean that some of the actors deliver their lines a bit poorly, but I forgive it on account of the fact that it clearly doesn't have that much of a budget and yet it still was able to pull together something that is truly memorable.If you want something big budget and exciting, this is definitely not for you. However, if you're looking for something small, tense, creepy and downright scary if you think about putting yourself in any of the protagonists' situation and work out how you might survive in such a foreign situation, then definitely give this one a go. It's not a 'cult classic' for nothing.",Cube

While no one can figure out how they got there, they have deduced that the cube has infinite rooms filled with death traps.

There is a single scene that kept me on the edge of my chair, while everything else was just sad cliché. And, of course, the ending is lousy in every way.There's not much sense in making a quality remake, because originality is the main charm of this story, and this movie completely wasted that awesome idea. When the movie ended I felt sad and angry at the same time. The idea deserves 10/10, the realization is maybe 4/10, so we have a weak 7 movie out of what should have been 11/10 masterpiece...7/10",Cube
42,The-Sarkologist,Is the Question 'Why' Relevant in out Struggle for Survival?,8,29 June 2013,"To put it blunt this is a pretty good movie, though it is not one of those movies that you can watch multiple times. In a way it is like Buried in that the style of the movie and the ideas that it portrays are brilliant but it can also be so disturbing that you can really only watch it once. Mind you, I have seen this film three times now, and also own the DVD, but after watching it this third time I thought to myself that maybe I really cannot consider watching it again. Also, this film has spawned two sequels, though I am doubtful that the sequels will be anywhere near as good as the original, and the fact that Cube Zero actually answers a lot of the questions that the first film raises sort of destroys the mystery that the original movie creates.Basically a group of people wake up in a cuboid room in a massive maze which is made up of other rooms, some of them trapped, others of them not. While questions are raise as to who made this thing and why they were placed there, these questions turn out to be meaningless simply because there is only one purpose here and that is to escape. I guess that is one of the ideas that comes out of this movie and that is that to many of us the philosophical questions really do not provide us with any real answers as we struggle to survive. In fact, one will note that those who tend to dwell on the philosophical questions are those that are financially free to enable them to pursue these goals. Many of the writers and philosophers in the past all came from rich and affluent societies, and even today the bulk of the working class simply do not care about the answer to 'why' but are only interested in their next paycheque.Then there is the idea of the prison. One thing that I discovered is that each of the characters are named after a famous prison (though only San Quentin and Leavenworth ring a bell to me). While the Cube is in itself a prison, the idea of the prison is not necessarily always physical, and some cases can be social and even mental. Kazan for instance is imprisoned by his autism, however it is interesting that he is the only one who manages to escape, possibly because it is his autism that actually makes him free. Worth is a prisoner of his boring job, and Quentin is a prisoner of his rage, which results in his destruction in the end. While putting on the face of a cop, as the movie progresses we slowly come to understand the destructive nature of his personality.",Cube

45,filipemanuelneto,"Boring, but well done.",3,7 April 2019,"I confess I expected more from this film. The script is very simple, typical in low-budget films: a group of people who do not know each other wake up, without noticing the reason, inside a windowless room in the shape of a cube. There are exit hatches in the center of each wall, as well as in the ceiling and floor. None of them know why they got there, where they are or what might happen ... but soon they realize that each room can hide deadly traps, and there is almost no way to find out which rooms are trapped, since they are virtually identical, although they are numbered.The movie is an attempt to make soft terror effective with few features and a minimal budget. To a large extent, the film does what it promises and gives the public a pleasant tension and a few moments of carnage. Here, however, the greatest danger comes from the tense relationship between characters, as the film plunges into a kind of ""cabin syndrome"" and relations between all are degrading. In this context, the good construction of all these characters (with a very rich and profound psychology, in a healthy coexistence since none of them is given prominence) is something to highlight and praise in this film. The cast is fairly decent, considering that I did not know anyone involved and everyone seemed to comply with the minimum that was asked of them and not make gross mistakes.The most unpleasant part of this film is precisely the fact that it is so simple: in fact, nothing happens here. Although the film flows reasonably, it is tasteless and has little to offer. There is no story, and that makes the movie boring.",Cube

49,southdavid,Button Moon,6,11 August 2020,"Another film, that I used to own on VHS, that I decided to watch again after years, decades probably. Whilst it's still got some moments, time hasn't been too kind to the microbudgeted Canadian thriller.A group of unconnected individuals wake up in a series of cubed shaped rooms, each of which has a hatch at the centre of all six sides. As they traverse the rooms and find each other, they discover that some of the rooms contain lethal traps. The group must learn to work together, using their specific skills to try and make it to the edge of the construction, but personality clashes, and the pressure of life and death choices start to take their toll.It's a great conceit for a movie, you have to give the film that. A single set, that is just redressed for a different moments - an easy to understand concept, but with science fiction trappings and horror overtones, but ultimately it's about people under pressure and how they react. When I used to watch it before, I think I took it at face value - but these many years later, the section of the film that resonates with me the most is the talk about silo systems and how wasteful and ridiculous things can be in business, obviously we're talking more about say, reports generated for years that nobody cares about, rather than accidentally creating and populating an underground death experiment.One or two other reviewers have said that the performances aren't great, personally I'd lay that criticism a little more at the feet of the script, rather than the actors - most of whom still work in the industry today. The visual effects are a mixed bag, some of the practical stuff is really great, including that memorable opening scene death, but later CGI work is less successful and is one true place where the film budget betrays it.Whilst it still has some power, particularly in its opening scenes, the longer it goes - the more repetitive it gets and the less the logic holds up.",Cube
50,Vartiainen,"Creative paranoia, intense emotions",7,12 June 2013,"It's great when film makers are willing to take chances with their premise, to truly step outside the norms of reality and invent something that could never exists - well, almost never. The premise of this film could technically exist today. You could be knocked out one day and then wake up in a cubic metal room with six doors, one on each surface, with no idea where you are, where to go or even why you are there. You won't, but you could and you're able to imagine what that would be like. It's an extreme situation where the horrors and wonders of human kind will be unleashed, and that's the beauty of this film. It's a fascinating character study of people but into a situation that none of them ever expected, but which has become a reality for them.The film is able to carry its story through mood and tone alone. The use of lighting, shadows and colours masterfully strengthens the claustrophobic atmosphere and the illusion of walls closing in. Add in the grinding sound effects, the heavy breathing and the whispered dialogues and you have a setting that's impossible to escape. You, the viewer, are in the Cube, along with its inmates.Probably the only thing holding this movie back is the fact that while it has a very imaginative premise, nothing definitive is said about the human condition. The inmates will panic, they will flee, they will triumph, only to fail again, and so on, but the final point of all this is never reached. Why was this story told? What did the film makers try to convey? In the end, I'm not sure, but at the same time I don't really care. The journey alone was more than enough, even if the final goal was kind of vague.Any fan of thrillers and psychological horror should see this film. It's an intense experience and capable of transporting you outside of your everyday life, into an unbearable situation from which there seems to be no escape.",Cube

54,MBunge,"It's like the Matrix, but not really.",8,10 September 2010,"Cube is a smart little sci-fi thriller out of Canada that is sort of like a low-budget, stylistic half-cousin of The Matrix. That doesn't mean Cube features a lot of kung fu and slow motion special effects. It means that, like The Matrix, this movie tells a gripping and engrossing story which has a lot of philosophical and even theological themes running through it.Cube is about 6 people who wake up in the middle of a death-machine. It's a giant cube made up of individual square rooms. Some of the rooms are safe and some will kill you in horrible ways. These 6 people, who don't know how or why they were put into the cube, have to work together to find their way outif such a way even exists. It's a fairly basic plot but it's extremely well executed, leaving you never quite sure exactly what's coming.The meat of the story comes from the interactions of the 6 main characters and the larger social/cultural attitudes they represent. Rennes (Wayne Robson) is a hardened criminal and expert at escaping from prison who only cares about saving his own hide. Quentin (Maurice Dean Witt) is a cop whose aggression and determination both protects and imperils everyone around him. Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a brilliant math student who mostly does what others tell her. Hollway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor and a leftist conspiracy theorist, always ready to blame the ""powers that be"" for screwing up everything. Worth (David Hewlett) is an apathetic office worker, the sort of guy who stands apart and watches life pass him by and inside the cube, he'll just stand and watch death run right at him. Kazan (Andrew Miller) is a mentally handicapped man who tests the limits and value of the others' compassion. These 6 characters in this fantastic circumstance are forced to confront the truth about themselves and question everything they believed about their lives and their reality.In addition to the conflicts between the characters and the challenges they have to overcome, Cube also raises broader issues of personal action and the purpose of life. Is this death-machine the deliberate creation of some evil minds or is it simply an idea that ran out of control because no one was willing to take the responsibility of stopping it? Does the cube represent a social order imposed on us by others or it is the product of our own actions and inactions? Is there any aim to how the cube operates or is it all meaningless? Does the way you survive inside the cube say something about the way you should live your everyday life? Is the maker of the cube a ""benevolent god"" trying to teach a lesson or a malevolent being who just wants others to suffer?There is uniformly fine acting by the cast, who all manage to give genuine human depth to archetypal roles. The dialog is direct without seeming contrived. The look and sound of the cube itself is tremendously impressive. Many films have spent a lot more money and not come up with anything as visually powerful and suggestive.This is a really entertaining, scary and thought-provoking movie. It's also similar to The Matrix in that Cube spawned two sequels, both of which seemingly didn't understand what made the first film so special and ended up sucking because of that. But no amount of lame ass sequels can take away from the fact that Cube is damn good.",Cube
55,estebangonzalez10,"Right mood and atmosphere, but not so strong performances",6,14 August 2015,"""That's the real challenge. You've gotta save yourselves from yourselves.""Shot in only 20 days with a hand-held camera in a single 14'x14' cubical set and a very low budget, this minimalist Canadian sci-fi horror film has become a cult favorite for many. Directed in 1997 by Vincenzo Natali, this was his first feature film and it still remains as one of his most popular ones, although Splice has also been warmly received by critics and seen by many more people thanks to its much bigger budget. He's also directed several TV series, including Hannibal which in my opinion stands out for its cinematography. Natali also co-wrote this original script with Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson (creator and producer of another hit series, Orphan Black). For its minimalist approach, Cube does manage to stand out and deliver several thrills along the way, but five minutes into the movie I feared I knew what direction the story was heading, and unfortunately it did, so it was a bit of a letdown. However the journey was quite a pleasant and gripping one, so the movie did flow at a strong pace and I was engaged with it original premise.The film begins with a man (Julian Richings) waking up inside a cube-shaped room without any recollection as to how he got there. There is one door on every side of the cube, leading to other same shaped rooms although with different colors. According to the suit he's wearing his name is Alderson. As he leaves one of the rooms and enters a new one he is sliced into small pieces by a trap consisting of thin wires. We later discover that there are more people in the cube when a small group of them find each other in one room. A police officer named Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), an architect named Worth (David Hewlett), a doctor named Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), an escape artist named Rennes (Wayne Robson), and a mathematician named Leaven (Nicole de Boer) all seem to have woken up in the same condition as Alderson and they are fighting their way through this maze trying to avoid the traps hidden in some of the rooms. They seem to have nothing in common as their personalities completely differ from one another, and they have no idea who could've put them in such a place. They do decide to stick together and try using their different talents to avoid the deadly traps as they move along through the maze looking for an escape. As the story unfolds and these characters begin interacting with one another tension and suspicion begin to rise among them. David Hewlett who has worked with Vincenzo Natali in all his feature films gets one of the lead roles here along with Maurice Dean Wint and Nicole de Boer. The performances in this film are the weakest link. Some of the dialogue scenes seemed forced and most of the characters' interactions felt unauthentic. The greatest problem was that most of these characters behaved in an inconsistent manner and the pressure they go through isn't a convincing reason for it. Quentin's character is the one who goes through the strongest transformation here and I just didn't feel it was natural. Other than the performances and the predictable finale, I did enjoy this small film and found the premise quite inventive despite its simplicity. With a stronger cast this could've been a great sci-fi horror film because Natali excels at setting the right atmosphere which creates a thrilling environment. The mood of this film reminded me a lot of Saw and I'm sure it was inspired by Natali's work. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Cube
56,jimbo-53-186511,A wonderful little film that is both intelligent and entertaining,8,15 January 2014,"Considering this was filmed in one location and also considering there were no major stars in this film, I thought it was a fantastic film which threw you into the plot pretty much straight away and never slowed down during the 90 minute running time.The film focuses on 7 strangers who end up trapped in a giant maze for unknown reasons. They find that they must work as a team to try and figure out how to get out of the maze. Of course, it isn't as straight forward as it first seems as there are thousands of rooms and when the team discover that some rooms are booby trapped, the task of getting out proves to be far more difficult than they ever could have imagined.The 7 protagonists are Leaven (mathematical whizz kid), Quentin (a police officer and self appointed leader), Worth (the man responsible for designing the outside of the cube, but has no knowledge of the inside of the cube) Kazan (a man who is mentally handicapped and also suffering from severe autism - he can work out astronomical sums in his head and is a very similar character to Raymond Babbitt who Dustin Hoffman portrayed in 'Rain Man') Holloway (a doctor) Rennes (a prison escapee) and Alderson (gets killed off in the first 2 minutes - no background info).The main strengths in this film arise from the characters themselves - right from the start there is an immediate sense of paranoia. None of the characters trust each other and you're never quite sure whether all of the characters are genuine or whether certain characters are 'traps' - this is what hooks you in. The very fact that you are never sure is what makes the film interesting and it ultimately makes the characters interesting as well. Although, there are no particularly 'big name' stars in here I felt that all the actors gave believable performances (particular praise should go to Miller in the role of the mentally handicapped/autistic character of Kazan). It's not easy to pull off this type of role convincingly, but I felt that Miller was right on the money and gave a truly brilliant performance. It's quite clear after watching Cube where Wan & Whannell got some of their influence when making the first Saw film - the booby traps, working out puzzles, strangers being trapped in a room together. Both films share similar themes and both of these films are intelligent and exciting.Whilst this film has many strengths and is both intelligent and engaging, there was one major problem; Why were these particular protagonists left in the Cube together?. It's a question that the protagonists ask each other at the start which we never get an answer to. I got subtle hints that some characters were maybe put in there due to areas of expertise (prison escape and mathematical skills) and other characters were placed in there as punishment (such as Quentin with his treatment of his wife and neglecting his kids). But by who and why? We're never given an explanation and that came as a big disappointment as I felt that there was no closure at the end of the film.Despite this gripe, this was a very impressive film. The acting was great, the direction was solid and all of the characters were interesting. The script (for the most part) was intelligent and the film is tense and engaging. It's a solid film that is definitely worth watching.",Cube

Personalities clash, people change both from good to bad and bad to good, from worthless to having much worth while the cube continues it's consistent pattern.  The people are left to figure out this puzzle.  The movie is worth something because it is very thoughtprovoking and you wonder what the thinking is behind the makers of this film.

58,Cristi_Ciopron,The fragment and the whole,8,18 October 2008,"When he was younger and suppler, Hewlett looked like MacLachlan and like Lemmonprettier than Lemmon, and subtler, brighter than MacLachlan (and, needless, I hope, to mention, a vastly superior actor). He certainly is an interesting actor. Extremely fit for slick, urbane, ambiguous characters, of subtlety. You see, the script seemed to require for underlined performances verging on overactingexcept for Hewlett; him, in part due to the nature of his character, maintains a soberer demure.Before this, I have seen an ulterior installment of the CUBE,one looking more futuristic. This one looks quite industrial, quite rough, like the deliberately wornout sets of the ALIEN.The first installment, that is, the original one, is hugely suspenseful, relatively well acted (Hewlett is the only distinguished performer), and quite violent. What sets apart THE CUBE is a sort of uncompromising boldness and forceit's not exploitation, it's an ambitiously conceived movie. It's very concept is strong and bold. As a metaphor, it has the sense of keeping understated. It does not look, and, in fact, it is not the existentialist manifesto. If offers, delivers a small portion, a fragment of an unknown set. So that it does not look like the deliberate didactic illustration of a thesis. Such an _absurdist take is very vehement and efficient. Do not patronize the audience, let them get only a fragment.Fastpaced, this thriller is wise in not pretending being able to say more about its characters than it's possible at such a pace. Some of them are merely sketched; others, are deepened. This depends on the performers, too. Such movies are less riddles, and more shocks, punches. THE CUBE is relatively smart; but it's good that it does not turn out being too smart. Because its strength is its fundamental honesty. It's very scale is intended as small, unassuming and fragmentary; at least, this is how I figure it. I liked the fact that it seemingly did not attempt to force one take it for what it's not .At certain turning points, the script is unafraid of taking unexpected decisions.",Cube
59,kluseba,Claustrophobic cult film from Canada,8,30 July 2019,"Cube is a mysterious science-fiction horror movie made with a meager budget of three hundred fifty thousand dollars that would turn out grossing nine million dollars and lead to two less interesting sequels. The claustrophobic movie revolves around six completely different strangers who wake up in a gigantic cube without knowing how or why they got there. Since they have no access to food or water or any way to communicate with the outside world, they need to find their way through the numerous chambers of the gigantic cube in order to find a way out. The different chambers are however rigged with deadly traps and tension, stress and fear soon arise between the six strangers.There are numerous elements that made this low-budget movie a beloved cult film. First of all, the mysterious setting and its origins are truly intriguing. It's unclear who created the gigantic cube and to what purpose which invites viewers to look for clues and come to their own conclusions. Secondly, the story is filled with twists and turns and it remains unpredictable who is going to survive and how until the very last Scene that also leaves room for interpretation. Thirdly, the traps in the cube are deadly, diversified and unpredictable but the greatest dangers are the individuals themselves. This leads to the fourth and strongest element which are the seven characters introduced in the movie. We only briefly meet a nameless old man but the clever prison escapist, the paranoid free clinic doctor, the mathematics student with a difficult past, the socially awkward office worker, the seemingly autistic young man who has trouble communicating but incredible mathematical skills and the divorced police officer with anger management issues are the six characters bound by fate. The relationships between the different characters are fascinating to watch and evolve until the very end.In the end, Cube works very well despite a low budget thanks to a creative story with numerous stunning ideas and intriguing characters. The sequels don't reproduce this level of quality because the stories are more predictable and the characters more exchangeable. Even though this movie mixes thriller, mystery and horror elements, it can also been as a stunningly realistic social science study.",Cube

62,rbverhoef,An interesting movie,8,1 February 2004,"'Cube' is an interesting movie with thrilling moments and a great look. The movie looks so great that other things can feel a little disappointing although they are pretty good as well. The only thing that didn't impress me very much was the dialogue.A couple of people find themselves in a room in the shape of a cube. In every wall they see a door. Behind every door they find another room in the shape of a cube. Every cube has its own colored light, and every door has a number. How did they end up there, why are they there and why have some rooms deadly boobytraps? We don't know and the characters don't know, although they have their secrets.One of them is a cop, another is an escape artist. We have a doctor, a mathematics student, an autistic guy and someone who doesn't speak very much. Together they must survive and find out what is going on. Since the movie is set in a cube the entire time there are moments we can imagine what the characters are thinking and feeling. The dialogue in these scenes doesn't work because it doesn't add anything and therefore it seems in the wrong place.But like I said there is enough to enjoy here. The mystery is pretty nice and we only know what the characters know and that has its fun. Every time the characters enter a new cube we have a thrilling moment because we. and they, can't be sure if the room has a secret. Because 'Cube' is so different from the movies we normally see it is at least interesting to watch. Whether you like it as much as I did is for you to decide. In my opinion there is enough to enjoy.",Cube

64,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Interesting Sci-fi, Psychological Thriller",9,1 August 2019,"This was a film that I remember watching for the first time and not having any idea what it was. My roommate in college had gotten a copy and I believe that was because he heard how well it did at festivals. It was an independent film that kind of came out of nowhere. I hadn't seen it since that one time actually. When it came up as part of the podcast series I'm participating in for the Best of the 1990's, I was excited to rewatch it. The synopsis is six complete strangers of widely varying personality characteristics are involuntarily placed in an endless maze containing deadly traps.We start this off with a man in an odd room. It is a prefect cube and he goes to one of the exits. His name is Alderson (Julian Richings). He tries to flee this room, but the next room is booby trapped and he's killed.It then shifts to another room. Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) starts to look around. He finds a knocked out man named Worth (David Hewlett). They are joined by Leaven (Nicole de Boer), Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) and Rennes (Wayne Robson). They try to figure a way out, but they learn about the traps. Rennes has come up with a way to detect them by tossing a boot into the room.As they try to find a way out, they try to remember the last thing before waking up here. They also start to delve into who they are to figure it out. Leaven is a mathematician that's still in college. Holloway is a doctor, Worth isn't forth coming about his past, Rennes is a thief who has escaped from multiple prisons and Quentin is a police officer.We soon learn that Rennes method doesn't work and Leaven realizes that there are numbers in each of the access points to the rooms. They are a key to figuring out if the rooms have a trap or not. They also stumble upon Kazan (Andrew Miller), a severely autistic man.The longer they go, the more they learn about each other and their nature. There are secrets here and as the tension grows, we see the darkness of humanity. Can they figure out this prison they're in before it is too late?Now I wanted to go a little bit light on the recap, because if I didn't I would have to go into spoilers and I think some of the best part of this film is actually experiencing. I will say that I love how basic the premise is. We never actually learn why they're there and I think that is actually scarier. They all have their reasons for being in this, but outside of that, there are others they could probably do the same things as some of them.What is really important that I took away from this film though is the darkness of humanity. I'll actually go into the acting here as well. Boer does a solid job at portraying a college student, even though she does look a tad on the older side to be the age she supposed to be. She does get really down about their plight, but when she realizes the help she can do, she moves into action. Guadagni is also good as she is one of the first to stand up to Quentin. She also gets push back, but she is also showing the good that is in humanity. Hewlett is interesting in that at first, we see him as a villain. There is a reveal about him that makes you think he's up to something, but I like the growth of his character. The performance plays it well. Miller has a reveal I ended up really liking and it fits with the story. Wint though does a great job here. He makes for a great counter to Worth and it makes the film even better as things breakdown, especially in a situation like this.I couldn't get through this without talking about the historical context either. This film was an independent and from what I gathered, it did really help horror by doing as well as it did. If it hadn't, I'm sure I'd never have heard of this. Going from that, it is also a film that helped to influence the 'torture porn' era of films that would come in the next decade. There is kind of a 'game' here and the traps directly influence Saw, Hostel and The Collector. There is a bit of back-story revealed through Worth. There are a few things tossed around, like this could be the government or some rich sicko who is doing this for a game.To move next to the pacing of the film, I think that is something else that is really good. It has a low running time, which works here. It never really hits a lull and since they are making educated guesses to stay alive, there is always that threat. The acting performances really drive the film and we get that feeling that as the tension grows with each frustrating thing that happens, the darkness of people shows more as well. It reveals the true characters. The ending definitely works for what the film is going for as well.Something that I didn't really remember was the effects of the film. This film had a low budget, which is interesting, because technically they only had one and half 'cube' rooms. They had to make them look different with lighting and to be honest, it worked. It feels so much bigger than that and it is surprising. The practical effects in the film are really good as well. There is an issue though I had with the CGI. Not all of it was bad, but some of it doesn't really hold up and that is something I noticed about the film. It is shot very well though in my opinion.Now with that said, this film for its budget is actually really good. It blew me away the first time I saw it and to be honest, it still holds up fro the most part after this second viewing. The story is really basic, but it definitely shows us the darkness of humanity. The film also has historical significance with films that came after. It is paced in a way that it never gets bored. The movie is driven by the acting, which is good across the board in my opinion. The practical effects are also well done, but I do have say that the CGI doesn't really hold up. The soundtrack didn't really stand out to me, but it also didn't hurt the film either. I would say that overall this is a good film and I would actually recommend this one for horror and non-horror fans alike.",Cube
65,Backlash007,"""I'm not dying in a f**king rat maze!""",10,15 November 2002,"~Spoiler~I gave Cube another go around the other day and realized that it truly is one of my favorite films.  It's the best sci-fi flick I've seen in a long while.  Cube is one of those rare films that has an oddness that appeals to all viewers.  The story relies on character development and dialogue because the movie does not stray from the cube. The characters are trapped inside and each have a purpose for being there. Watching the strangers go from optimistic to insane is downright scary.  The relatively unknown cast is amazing.  The best performances come from Maurice Dean Wint as the crazed Quentin who does one of the best flip-flops I've ever seen and David Hewlett.  For his work in Pin and Scanners II, Hewlett has become one of my favorite lesser known genre actors.  His character, Worth, is aptly named because he seems to have none.  He plays the most apathetic character ever, and he plays it perfectly.  The claustrophobic elements really work here as well and the cube design is awesome.  The booby traps are mind-blowing, especially the one Resident Evil ""borrowed.""  This all makes for a completely original yarn that is extremely entertaining.  Cube is definitely deserving of all its hype and an impressive debut for director Vincenzo Natali. Note for genre buffs:  Nearly everyone in the cast guest starred in the vampire/cop series Forever Knight.  Also, the characters are all named after prisons.",Cube

67,raulfaust,Life?,10,2 October 2014,"""Cube"" has been one of my favorite suspenseful movies since I first saw it, and last Saturday I just confirmed the reason why. This happens due to the GREAT storyline that has been written; the philosophical thoughts are extremely well done. I've read a thousand of theories throughout the years on the internet, and, until now, there is no official response to who was behind this big engineering. The main question that every spectator asks himself is: What was it all about? And that's what makes it diabolically good: the uncertainty. Also, the actors are very professional-- even if unknown in mainstream--, giving life to all the good characters that have been written. I have no doubt that ""Saw"" was inspired in this cult horror gem. All in all, ""Cube"" is an original, scary, suspenseful and philosophical film that deserves all the recognition it has, and I really doubt that filmmakers will elaborate anything as good as this picture-- mainly if considering that nowadays' horrors only repeat what has already already done. Thumbs up!",Cube
68,Matt_Layden,I Adore This Movie.,9,20 July 2009,"I love this film, I simply cannot get enough of it.7 people wake in an enclosed cube, with a door on each side leading to another cube. Some of these cubes have traps in them. Can these 7 people survive long enough to find salvation? I love the concept and the team behind this film prove that you do not need a lot of money to make a great film, just passion. (side tidbit of info, the cost to re-dub the audio was more then the entire budget of the film).I love the ambiguity of this film, later to be ruined by the sequel/prequels. You never get any outside contact with anyone. You're stuck in this prison with the characters. With great use of colour, the filmmakers have created a sense of endless rows of hell and torture, when in reality there was really only one or two sets.The tension in this film is great, specifically the scene in which the trap is activated by sound. For films like this, it always gets my thinking about how I would react in this certain situation. I applaud films that make me think this way, it gets me engaged.There was no other way to end this film then the way they did and I was so happy they did it. Reading about the alternate ending and if they had thrown that it, I don't know if I could like this film as much as I do.I recommend this film to anyone looking for a good sci/fi flick. I watched it because it does have it's horror elements. The deaths are more gruesome then your run of the mill horror flicks these days.

Not amazing, but pretty well done.A group of strangers wake up inside a strange cube shaped room, they have no idea how they got there or who their captor is, but realise they were all brought together for a reason. Each room is either a deadly trap from razor spikes to flamethrowers or either a safe room, all colour coordinated & coded based on the room type.I found the film to be pretty decent, not amazing but good enough. Being a slasher fan I was expecting more & felt the premise could've been taken advantage of more than what it was. Their could've been a good body count, unique deaths, gory deaths. I also felt the film was too mathematical & psychological in a lot of areas. I know it's that type of film, but to balance it out more with some action wouldn't have gone a miss.I did like the creepy feel the film had & the unique traps & deaths (of what little there was).Overall, a decent Sci-Fi Horror! 7/10",Cube
70,slayrrr666,"Disappointing, dull and almost unwatchable",3,26 September 2008,"""Cube"" is definitely a let-down without a whole lot going for it.**SPOILERS**Awakening in a strange box, Quentin, (Maurice Dean Wint) Leaven, (Nicole DeBoer) Worth, (David Hewlett) Holloway, (Nicky Guadagni) and Rennes, (Wayne Robson) realize they're trapped in a gigantic maze with no memory of what they're doing in it. When they realize that there's traps inside certain rooms, and that the rooms are all apart of a gigantic cube, they begin to wander through to safety. As they wind their way through, they start to realize a distinct pattern through the way the cubes are designed, which they believe is useful in getting out. Finding Kazan, (Andrew Miller) also stuck inside with them, they find that the numbers are getting lower due to the fact that they keep wandering into traps, which leads them to the secret that could lead them out of the deadly contraption.The Good News: There's almost nothing worthwhile about this one. One of the main reasons to see this one is the first two kills to this. There's a couple of them spread throughout, but the very first ones are the most important. The first one is really impressive and incredibly gory, which is just the right way to get the film going off to a great start. The next one is another really brutal one and actually has some really great moments in the set-up for it, which is a nice twist that produces a fun kill. The only other area that works to this is the way it handles the character's transition, which is done nicely and comes off rather well and as surprising. These here are all that work for this one.The Bad News: This one had a couple problems with it. The main one is that there's hardly anything going on in here. There's an extreme avoidance of the traps in here merely because it decides to focus on the rather annoying habit of having everyone yell at each other for trying to solve the riddles or just plain doing math to begin with. There's not a whole lot of exciting scenes of people yelling math solutions at each other, and that this takes up the entire middle segment of the film, lasting close to the hour mark, and these really start to take a toll on the film. At the end, these simply use up the time that could've been spent on luring those into the traps, the real reason for this one. Seeing only a couple fall to traps and most of the time ignoring them is something that doesn't sit well at all, ruining the film of it's main attraction and completely undoes most of the good it had, what little there was to start with. These are the film's biggest flaws.The Final Verdict: Not a whole lot to really say about this one, some good things and a couple flaws, but nothing that really sticks out. If you have to see this one, then do so as well as fans of the others in the series, though those looking for something other than what this provides should ignore altogether.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence",Cube
71,screenman,Not For The Squeamish,8,30 March 2008,"I only intended to offer 6 or 7 stars, but its simple audacity moved me to give it more.This is very much a 'what would I do in the same place' movie. And it's shocking. I begin to wonder if some people do not spend their spare time imagining increasingly bizarre and monstrous ways in which to kill. That is certainly the case here.The set is fairly straightforward. It's a sort of prison-cell with trapdoor openings in all of the walls, ceiling and floor. Each gives access to a seemingly identical cell which may be illuminated in a different colour. That obviously keeps production costs to a minimum as one set fits all. In fact, the cells are not quite identical. Some contain the most diabolical booby-traps imaginable.A group of inmates, or guinea-pigs wake and find themselves inside this grotesque maze and it becomes evident that their combined skills and abilities are their potential salvation. They work from cube to cube attempting to discover how to escape. It should also be mentioned that each cube is part of a complex in which they frequently move like a colossal Rubic Cube.Naturally, tempers fray and conflicts develop. This is especially so when those who think they are inevitably suited to leadership and command, find that in truth they have little to offer, and instead the least likely members are the more needful. It's a clever little observation about human behaviour, but which is not very well evaluated or explored. The script and acting are all a tad stagy, but the oddness of the whole situation still carries the movie forward and the viewer watching.There is no explanation or overview to their plight or the nature of the hell in which they are plunged, and this may disappoint those who like things cleared-up at the end. You take it for what it is; a bizarre idea, ordinary people, life and death.Weird and Wonderful.",Cube
72,Gislef,It's a 90 minute Twilight Zone episode,8,20 July 1999,"And if you like TZ, that's all well and good.  There's no real explanation for the goings-on (only a vague X-Files type conspiracy theory), but not a lot of TZ episodes stood up to rational analysis either.You do have to wonder who built this thing, since other than the Cube itself, nothing seems particularly ""futuristic"".There are a few questionable premises.  The implication is that the characters all have skills that contribute to their escape.  Well, first of all the doctor doesn't.  Secondly...this implies this is a deliberate test that particular characters with particular skills were all placed together. But then we're led to believe the whole thing is random.  So...which is it?There are also some minor nits, like who cleans up all of the many (presumably) bodies that have gone before?  Why does no one clean up Rennes' body, so that it is left behind as a plot point?Some of the math seemed a little shaky to me.  And I wasn't too impressed with the math whiz.  She has to look at a three-digit even number for a couple of second to figure out it isn't prime.  Ummm, hon, if it ends in an even number, it can't be prime.  If it ends in a '5', it can't be prime either, but she actually has to stare at it for a couple of seconds to figure this out??The characters themselves, however, are interesting enough, given that we're not seeing them in the best possible light.  Maurice de Wint, an underrated Canadian actor, probably gives the best overall performance.  His switchover to savagery is a little too abrupt (one second he's saving the doc, the next he drops her) for my tastes.  And the writers can't resist giving him a Jason-like ""return from the dead"" sequence.The other characters are an interesting lot.  I wasn't impressed with deBoer (but her ""talents"" on DS9 often escaped me as well), but David Hewlett is perfect.Overall, Cube is not your typical film, so going into it expecting a happy ending is probably not a good idea.  It does make you think, though, although its most important issues (Kazam's final escape) are not spoken.",Cube
73,moviewizguy,Fear... Paranoia... Suspicion... Desperation,5,25 September 2007,"Six different people, each from a very different walk of life, awaken to find themselves inside a giant cube with thousands of possible rooms. Each has a skill that becomes clear when they must band together to get out: a cop, a math whiz, a building designer, a doctor, an escape master, and a disabled man. Each plays a part in their thrilling quest to find answers as to why they've been imprisoned.So for you people who are researching this movie because of ""Saw"", I guess it's worth watching. For those who haven't seen ""Saw"" but somehow researched this film for some reason, then I guess it's worth watching. I say this for one reason: It might or will determine how you will like or not like the movie.Why? If you have seen films with people waking up and finding themselves being tortured or killed (which probably is what modern horror movies are these days), ""Cube"" plays like any of these movies, but it's not fair because this film was made in 1997.This is basically a body count movie with some intelligence. You can see surprises coming far away and the film is mostly suspense-free and the whole film basically follows a pattern: Room, room, surprise, kill, room, room surprise kill, math room, room, more math, math, room, kill, surprise, math, math, room, room, etc.See, I might have liked this movie more if I haven't seen any movies that are related to this one. Now I have to admit there were some surprising moments and one tense scene, but I really did not find this movie any different than what we see today in horror movies. Also, the performances by the ensemble is decent.Like I said, if you have seen no movies related to this, this is worth watching. If not, there's nothing new here.",Cube

Years after, I have tried it again - and immediately all the weaker points went visible - very weak acting, poor script, long (too long) dialog parts at times, boring sequences, and yeah, the film didn't hold - it fell apart, before it got exciting. The trite plot betrayed shallow characters, limp psyche and lame ideas. What was more shocking, there was no compassion or interest in any of the heroes, be that Kazan or Leaven. They all seem bland, gray and one- dimensional, and in case with Quentin, a promising beginning gave way to a very disastrous under-developed hell of a terrible person. The Cube seemed to be in the same league like Lawnmower Man - once, it was awesome, very soon later - awful. There are low-budget movies which can deliver fun or thrill.

There are doors on all sides, and they must find the right way to enter the door. When they do, then they are in another cube.

79,oneguyrambling,"A satisfying alternative to more ""mainstream"" fare.",6,7 November 2010,"Cube is original, uses no gimmicks or trickery, and doesn't dumb down anything to please the audience. It is by no means the best film going around or probably even in the top 20 films of 1997, but I thought it was worth a look then and I still do now.I view Cube as similar to Pi and Primer, two low budget flicks that took a risk and made strangely compelling and interesting films. They might not stack up to your Die Hards, T2s or Alienssss, but they give a bit of much needed variety.A guy wakes up in a large empty room with metal walls, floor and ceiling, he opens a door which leads into an exact copy of the previous room, walks into the room and is immediately and without warning sliced and diced, Resident Evil style by a booby trap that he triggered.Ladies and gentlemen, meet Cube.In other rooms more people wake up, each in their own room, it appears that all rooms are interlocking and one by one they meet. No-one knows why they are in the rooms, how they got there or what happens next, but they know this isn't the office Christmas party.Initially there are 5 ""inmates"", three guys and two women, as they interact and query their predicament it becomes evident that there is no easy similarity between them all or reason for them being there, there is a doctor, a cop, maths student, an ""escape artist"" and a person who describes himself simply as an office worker.They ponder and plan how they might escape from the situation that they are in, theories and plans are hatched and most immediately shelved, but after moving carefully through a couple more rooms using a bait approach to show any booby traps their number is suddenly and graphically reduced to 4. More clues are discovered, more theories are introduced, and they come across another inhabitant in the maze.The new chum is best described as a more highly strung rain man type, capable of certain logical thought but largely useless for the group's short term goals, and in fact a hindrance in many situations.As the group don't know each other a certain level of snippiness and resentment is inevitable, though it does feel a little forced on occasion, even when their circumstances are considered. They continue musing why them? why there? and who did this? but no simple answer is provided.When a breakthrough is had, the group dynamic changes somewhat, as allegiances are formed and dissolved and paranoia rules, ultimately leading to betrayal, treachery and violence, as any good story should.Without going into who dies first, why they are there and if any manage to escape, I must give credit for the filmmakers efforts to at least try to make things interesting. This is obviously a low budget production but they manage to squeeze as much as they can from the limited sets and what is likely a minimal special effects budget. This is a reasonably smart, if sometimes baffling exercise in building tension and creating uncertainty and unease, and for the large part it succeeds. There are no explosions, no snappy one liners or gratuitous hotties, and only a few scenes of violence or gore, and so when they arrive they actually have a bit more impact as we are a little less desensitised.Final Rating 6.5 – 10. I can't unequivocally recommend Cube for everyone, but if you don't mind the odd experimental art-house-y flick, this is more interesting than 20 Transformers movies, despite an absence of Megan Fox's tanktop.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Cube

82,MrGKB,"Ambitious, though flawed...",6,7 June 2012,"...this feature-length debut from storyboard-artist-turned-writer/director, Vincenzo ""Splice"" Natali, remains a notable late-90s cult classic, presaging the Grand Guignol machinations of the ""Saw"" franchise while drawing on a raft of cinematic and literary predecessors as diverse as Kafka, ""The Outer Limits,"" ""Waiting for Godot"" and ""Lord of the Flies."" The concept is simple: a handful of characters imprisoned in what turns out to be a matrix of cubes (that periodically shift position within a larger cube) who must find their way out before dying of starvation/dehydration. The whys and wherefores are only vaguely explained (one character apparently helped design this fantastical apparatus), and it doesn't help that many of the cubes feature deadly traps that aren't easy to detect in advance, but it's the clash of personalities that gives ""Cube"" its raison d'être, elevating it above the herd of low-fi wannabees into the realm of cult status.The acting is mostly hammy, the plot has a tendency to derail itself in favor of melodramatic excess, and there are numerous flaws in the story itself (a math geek who doesn't instantly recognize obvious non-prime numbers, or how long it takes these folks to realize the cubes are shifting position), but in its totality, ""Cube"" still manages to hold the viewer. Ably lensed by Derek ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" Rogers, suitably scored by Mark ""The Border"" Korven, and featuring some early fx work from C.O.R.E. ""The Tudors"" Digital Pictures, ""Cube"" achieves a good deal with its low budget, and certainly more than enough to justify a viewing by various genre fans.

In any event, at the end, I felt like I had a somewhat interesting movie experience, although I would have watched something else if I really knew what I was getting into, and I definitely won't be watching any sequels.

86,juliankennedy23,We turn the Cube and it twists us.,8,15 April 2018,"Cube: Cube is a story of six or so people who wake up in a... well... cube. On each side of the cube (including above and below), there are doors that lead to other cubes. Some of the cubes have deadly traps. There are three etched three-digit numbers on each cube that may provide a clue whether a particular cube is deadly and may also provide a clue on how to escape. Can the figure a way out without getting killed before they succumb to starvation or thirst or are simply driven mad?The Good: I have a lot of pet peeves in movies. One of the biggest is films that explain everything to the audience as if we were dimwitted fourth graders. The Cube explains nothing. I love this. We can decide which of the characters speculations are correct or even if any of them are. This creates a wonderfully engaging film.The film is well written with some excellent character arcs. Some of the characters are a little on the trope side of the equation (I am looking your way Rain Man) but overall it is an engaging group. There is a nice argument between just moving forward one cube at a time and the idea of trying to figure out what it all means. The movie really doesn't take sides once again allowing the viewer to decide which approach is best.The special effects are actually quite good when they make an appearance and the set keeps one's interest for the relatively brief running time.The Bad: The movie plays its room trap cards pretty early in a truly spectacular way. One wishes they had revisited that a bit more throughout the film. The film also suffers a little from the we ran out of cannon fodder too soon syndrome.It really isn't that hard to figure out is a three digit number is prime. If it is an even number or ends in a five it isn't prime as an example. Our so-called math expert in the group took way to long to figure some of these out.In Conclusion: This is a great example of how to make a low budget film with only seven actors, one set, and an engaging interesting script. The last part is a nut plenty of big-budget movies have yet to crack. Like the early Saw films, Cube is greater than the sum of its parts and a wonderful example of minimalism in a film.",Cube

The rest of it is up to the viewers and the keen ones will undoubtedly notice many hints beneath the surface narrative as to what is going on, but in the end, this is best seen as a metaphorical nightmare. Whether it is one that H.P. Lovecraft would have or one that George Orwell would have is really beside the point and it can easily be seen either way or even both at the same time. It is that lack of explanation in a well made film that can render it powerfully symbolic on many levels. It is a nightmare that scares many people and scares each one in their own way. Interestingly it is not really the film that scares you directly, it scares you indirectly. It is your own mind that scares or better yet, frightens, you as it searches for possible answers as the protagonists search for essentially the same thing.""Cube"" is so effective, because it pulls you right into what is going on screen.

In fact, if SAW has a plot and settings which we can easily understand, based on a psycho-game ""in the real world"", CUBE is passed on a gigantic cube full of thousands of small rooms (also cubic). It's really based on an abstract concept and it keeps it until the end. We start to know nothing about what's going on, and we finish the same way All that we can find out along the plot is the ""stories"" and the personalities of the characters. And the intention of the movie is just that: to be an abstract mortal game to watch Human's emotional reactions: fear, despair, paranoia, suspicion I found this movie very interesting because of that. It might be a little boring that the scenarios are always these Sci-fi cubic rooms, but the tension and the suspense created are enough to maintain viewer's attention until the end. And the ending was great too, because it doesn't give you any answers but just proves that sometimes innocence and weakness can be stronger than anything else.",Cube

(I was kind of amazed to see that fact.) I loved this film. But I don't like the ending. At least, they should have shown Kazan got out to the outside world with the real environment full of trees, houses/apartments and grasses.One more thing I think it should have is the answers to the questions of why they are put in that cube and who built that crazy place. If they put these details, it'd be greater than this.Still, I completely enjoyed the whole film. Nicely done it.",Cube
93,oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,Musings on Cube,10,8 June 2007,"In a situation where the characters are unaware of why they are in the cube, each character's assertion is more of a revelation about themselves and their own prejudices. One claims that they are there for a rich man's kicks, another that a facility that size could only have been built by the 'military industrial complex'. Whist yet another that they have been abducted by aliens. It is one of the central horrors of the film that no attempt is made to explain the reasoning behind the tests they are put through. It is also its major success (especially when compared to the prequel Cube Zero) because it allows us to focus on the psychologies of our archetypal characters and the nature of human society.Quentin's own prejudices are laid bare in particularly brutal fashion. His eyes-down foot-forward approach to policing and belief in the system is shown to be moral irresponsibility, his authoritarian principles equated with simple misogyny, or more accurately a complete inability to relate to women. We see that this family man, with three children, is a simple brute. His assertion that he needs to get out for his kids in fact hides his base need to survive and dominate. This transition or unmasking is shown to harrowing effect when he proceeds to beat the architect with a boot, swinging it by its laces, as if he is brutalising a particularly naughty child. In a sense this is a highly feminist film or perhaps female chauvinist. The only three positive characters are two women and a severely mentally disabled man (an idiot savant).The cube is basically a metaphor. The architect's description of the building of the cube is vague and almost metaphorical. He describes a hideous bureaucracy in which people are only responsible for small parts of the construction and planning, and says that there really is no oversight for the project, it has simply become self-fulfilling. This is more a description of the ills of our sleepwalker society than a logical explanation for the genesis of the cube project. It is reminiscent of the dictum that whilst there may not be any evil bankers, the international banking system is evil.The simple premise of the movie is that the characters are trapped as much by themselves as by any diabolical machinery. They must group together to survive. All of this metaphor and philosophy aside, the movie is a masterclass in paranoia, horror and murders with a touch of elan. If if doesn't terrify you, one way or the other, you haven't a nerve left in your body.",Cube

95,movieguy1021,Cube: 7/10,7,26 June 2004,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty tired of all these wanna-be horror movies that are out now. All of those movies are rated PG-13 and can't seem to scare anyone. But right at the verge of these so-called horror movies came Cube, a low-budget horror film with an original idea and a good idea of how to execute it. It could have gone belly-up, but it works for the most part and creates a suspenseful movie.A group of seven people find themselves trapped in some sort of maze of cubes. They're all different colors and to make matters more interesting, some are booby trapped. They have no recollection of how they got there, nor do they have a clue how to get out. It becomes a battle of wits to stay sane and survive.There's an overall sense of creepiness, doom, and claustrophobia that overshadows the whole movie, not to mention the paranoia that sinks into both the characters and you as you watch. You only know as much as the characters-you don't know how they got into the cubes, what they're for, or any of the typical exposition. And although most of the characters were annoying, it put you side by side with them, which helped a lot. If you get to be next to the characters, you can understand their actions more. However, you do (somewhat) find out what these cubes were made for, which kind of dampers the whole thing, but it's still very interesting to go through.But when the climax comes about, the movie descends into hokey B-horror land, with a terrorized killer stalking most of the people. When the original exploration of the cubes subsides and you get the people walking around, also, the interest starts to wane. It's often repetitive, but the booby traps are quite, for lack of a better word, fun. But that doesn't mean that the original creativity has gone away, it's just not as interesting. But I really liked Cube, and if you see it, you will too.My rating: 7/10Rated R for some strong sci-fi violence/gore and language.",Cube
96,Imdbidia,Original thriller,7,7 February 2011,"An original and thrilling indie Canadian mathematical and psychological thriller with some horror moments.A group of five people -4 males and 2 females- found themselves, like by magic, trapped in a cube-capsule within a gigantic Kubrik-ish labyrinthine cube, and are trying to escape from it. The presence of all the characters is necessary as any of their personal skills and personalities are going to be necessary to solve the mystery. Mathematics play an important role in deciphering how to get from a cube to another within being killed, and to escape from the big cube. The movie is claustrophobic, unsettling and full of mystery.The whole concept and idea is brilliant, especially if we take into account that was shot in 1998 and that is still refreshing and captivating today. However, the plot has important flaws. Who built the cube? Why was built for? Who keeps it running or it moves itself? Why were the members of the group chosen and not other people with the same skills? How were they taken to the cube? Who is responsible for this? Are they dreaming? Are they mice-like characters in an experiment? I found the general acting mediocre, with the only exception of Adrew Miller who is great as the autistic savant. Especially bad are Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, and Nicky Guadagni as Dr Helen Holloway, their performances really ruining the movie and the believability of their respective characters.I enjoyed the movie tremendously, so very entertaining and mentally engaging, but the flaws in the plot and the bad acting are too important not to consider them when rating it.",Cube
97,Eumenides_0,Horror Movie with Good Art Direction,6,13 September 2009,"Vincenzo Natali's Cube is a formulaic horror movie playing with the famous premise of getting strangers in a mysterious situation and see how they interact. It's Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (I wanted to use the original title, but sadly IMDb believes in censoring certain words). Except instead of a mysterious man killing people who got away clean with murder, we have a mysterious cube killing people for no apparent reason.This pointlessness and randomness seems to be an element of high rating for its fans. It seems people like pointless movies more than I imagined. The complete indeterminacy (we're far beyond the level of ambiguity here) of the nature of the cube has generated more theories than the 17,000 cube rooms that constitute the Cube.The Cube is just a well-paced, suspenseful horror thriller with an art direction better than most horror movies (with the possible exception of Dario Argento's colorful '70s movies). I marvelled at the design of the cube room, its deadly traps and the shots of the outer shell.The characters are just one-dimensional figures going wherever the plot require them to go. Too many clichés abound, especially the one I most despise - the bad guy who seems dead but returns for one last scare.As an exercise in keeping the viewer on edge, this movie wins. Otherwise it's a one-time-only experience.",Cube

Some of these rooms are trapped, some are not. These people have no idea how they got there and none of them know each other but they all have a purpose and they must use these purposes to try and escape the giant maze before they die of dehydration.....or madness.This low-budget independent Canadian film is brilliant and a very captivating watch. It's a fairly simple concept but at the same time it is very complex and deep. All the characters are there for a reason and the reasons are fleshed out and believable. The idea of how the cube works is also fleshed out and you can tell the filmmakers really spent a lot of time exploring it. It all seems believable which is important for a movie like this.But the thing I really admire about the film is that the ending doesn't try to explain anything. It leaves everything up to you, you have to figure things out for yourself. The ending leaves a sense of dread and paranoia and is very effective. The traps are also very cool and some of the resulting gore is pretty nasty.4½/5",Cube

But it was ruined!Don't read this if you haven't seen it.I loved the idea of people being trapped in this maze and not knowing why or how, superb idea.  Of course I don't know how one would react in such a situation, but why would this cop, a man who does good, go crazy and start killing and beating people for no apparent reason?  Kind of stupid if you ask me.  Also...as one of the other comments mentioned...how would this so-called cop get to the end of the maze on his own?  There is no way he could get anywhere without the girl genius or the autistic guy.  ...Ok, so let's assume that he does get to the end of the maze...why didn't Leavin and Worth hear the door opening when the ""cop"" came into the room?This movie went from a great sci-fi, mind-job movie to a retarded horror pointless story.Here's a question for the Director/Writer...Why on earth did you have these characters go through hell just to die at the brink of escaping?

100,dfa120374,Not Bad At All,5,16 January 2015,"A handful of strangers wake up in a room, not knowing where they are or why they are there. They soon realise that they are trapped in some kind of cubed contraption where all joining rooms appear to be the same. They quickly find out, however, that all the rooms are not the same as some are booby trapped and some are not. Not knowing if they are there purely for someone's sick entertainment or if they are part of some kind of government experiment, they have to try and all work together to figure out what rooms are safe and how to get out alive.OK straight to the point here - if you don't like slower-paced movies or films where you have to think about things then don't even bother with this one as you will not like it. Also, if you're hoping that it's some kind of gore-filled Saw ""lookalike"" then, again, you'll be disappointed.Cube is a pretty decent psychological sci-fi thriller and is actually an original and clever idea as this was done in the days long before movies like Saw and The Collector. As mentioned before, it is quite a slow-paced movie, but you don't really get bored when watching it because you get drawn into the story and it does tick along pretty nicely, gradually building up suspense as it goes along.Some of the traps in the movie are so simple but they work so well, especially the very first one you see in the opening scene, and some of the effects are really well done especially for such a low-budget film. The only real downside is that some of the acting from Maurice Dean Wint who plays Quentin is a little bit over the top, but it's not enough to really ruin the movie.Cube is yet more proof that a little low-budget independent movie can do just as good as the big blockbusters that cost hundreds of millions of $, if not sometimes better.A pretty decent film to watch.",Cube
101,SquigglyCrunch,A Cool Concept and Well-Presented Movie,8,29 February 2016,"The concept of Cube isn't one that we haven't seen generally speaking, but it's one that certainly works. It follows 7 people who are trapped inside a giant cube filled with many other booby-trapped cube-shaped rooms and are trying to escape. How they got there is unknown, why they were kidnapped is unknown, and where they are is unknown. It's never explained where, how, or why, and it works quite well with this movie. The plot of Cube isn't particularly unique, but it's presented quite well. It's filled with great twists and turns that keep you interested and wanting to know what happens next. It's not a predictable movie typically, and there is some genuine tension throughout. The characters all feel expendable, so you never really know who's going to live and who's going to die. The characters are developed enough that you care about them, without going to deep to the point of being unrealistic. While I prefer deep character development typically, this is one movie where it's more realistic not to have that. And it did just that.Overall Cube is a great movie. The plot is, if not original, well- presented, the characters are good and realistic, and there is some very good tension throughout the movie. In the end I'd definitely recommend this movie, specifically to fans of the thriller genre.",Cube
102,garethcrook,Simple and effective.,9,7 October 2020,"You can't beat a good opening scene and this has one of the best in the sci-fi horror genre. It doesn't mess around from that initial sharpener either. At an economical 90 minutes, there's little time for pleasantries. We're trapped in a cube. A cube of cubes. All interlocking, with 6 doors each and many booby trapped. The ensemble cast don't know why they're there or how. There's 6 of them... after number 7 gets diced before the opening credits. They're left to navigate an escape through this psychological Crystal Maze. We've got a doctor, a cop, a criminal, a math nerd... an architect. It's a bit tropey, a bit cheesy, especially Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) the cop, who plays his role wonderfully over the top and Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) the doc, whose paranoia, although functional is a bit annoying. It's a genius idea though. Essentially the same set, same room, same cube, lit differently. The repetition adds to the building tension, as the team start to lose their collective marbles. Tracking numbers, deciphering one another, what does it all mean? Why are they there? and what connects them? They're not an altogether likeable bunch, that is until Kazan (Andrew Miller) drops in. He falls through the ceiling door of one room and into the lives of our wannabe escape artists. There's some lovely set pieces too, the room trapped with sound sensors and the realisation that the rooms are moving. It does have a very solid 90s aesthetic, largely down to its soundtrack, but you can't hold that against it, it's great piece of cinema. A bit cult, possibly classic. Director Vincenzo Natali I don't think has topped this on the big screen, but has had a hand in some pretty great TV. He certainly has a gift for working a good idea on a budget. Apparently he was down to direct the Tremors reboot, which would've been worth a watch had it not been canned.",Cube
103,Rickting,Complex but rewarding and under-appreciated horror movie,7,26 October 2014,"A group of strangers are trapped in a giant maze made of cube shaped rooms with various deadly traps. They are trying to find their way out through the giant labyrinth of traps, riddles and twists which would make the makers of Saw jealous. The cube maze the characters are in represents this movie: Twisty, dense, complex and pretty darn confusing. This is a critically ignored movie which later gained a cult following and deservedly so. Like many B movies, it starts out shaky. Its characters leave you cold and it keeps repeating itself. It also has its various detours into generic B movie clichés which weaken the film and it goes from set piece to set piece without ever delivering a knockout punch. However, the film improves as it progresses. The characters become more developed, different layers are revealed and information is revealed in a structured and clever way. The set pieces get more and more heart in mouth and ultimately Cube gets as much as it can out of its generic but brilliant premise.A mature decision was to leave much of what goes on ambiguous and the film thankfully doesn't have a major reliance on gore. It does get rather claustrophobic although after a while we get used to the setting. Cube is one of those movies where you're in the trap for the whole thing, and no sighting of the outside world means it feels a bit more artificial but this adds to the tension at the same time. The acting improves as the film goes on and although the cast still seem to be unknown, they do a good job. The director doesn't seem to be too prolific which is a shame as there's clearly plenty of talent here. The script doesn't do anything special but it tells the story decently and spits out the many twists with admirable effort. Cube is not a great movie but it is a very interesting one and a likable albeit sadly obscure effort. If you ever get bored of watching Saw, this would definitely be a good alternative and it's good for anyone who likes puzzles. I doubt you'll be able to solve the puzzle in this movie though.7/10",Cube

I could guess the tone of the film and I made all kinds of predictions about the plot from that first scene, and I was totally right.The film was low budget garbage, with stupid characters, unrealistic conflicts, and a plot that is not really engaging. The dialogue is atrocious and there is never a sense that it is going anywhere. Indeed, neither the conflict between characters nor the search for the solution to the puzzle they are facing provide a payoff. In the end we are treated first to a solution that seems to fall from the sky, in which the audience cannot participate. Then, as though that's not enough, we have one of those over the top, absurd endings that are supposed to pack an emotional punch, but end up just alienating the audience. This is a bad film that manages to have an even worse ending than one might expect.'Cube' is a very disappointing viewing experience because we are made to endure a lot of suffering along with the characters and we are not treated to an ending that makes it worth while. They took the audience into the 'cube' and when they let us out, we were left wondering why. There is no insight, no purpose, no catharsis. Just a feeling you got cheated.",Cube
106,dfle3,Mysterious but intriguing thriller,6,4 July 2008,"""Cube"" is an odd little movie which you could describe as a ""high concept"" film. In other words, it was probably made on the strength of a pitch which went something like this: ""Seven people awaken and find themselves inexplicably trapped inside of a giant cube. They have to navigate there way to the outside, but find many compartments to be death traps. Who will make it out, alive, from THE CUBE?!"". Sound interesting? Perhaps you could view this thriller as an inverse scenario to the classic horror movie ""Hellraiser"" which I've also reviewed at this site.Anyway, this movie fortunately gives a wide berth to any humbug about the nature of the cube these seven people find themselves in. If it had gone down that direction, I'm sure it would have been laughable, but you can imagine your own scenariossomething of a scenario like in the ""Saw"" franchise of splatter movies? Another possibility is hinted at when the film ends, which I won't go into, to let you come to your own conclusions. All very mysterious, which is as it should be for this kind of stuff.Since I've given this film a score of around 6/10 (and I'm going on memory to rate this film), why should you see it? Well, it has the most aesthetically pleasing scene of human butchery I've ever seen. Hmmmsounds badwell, it's not really that bad. Right at the start of the movie, there is a scene which is sort of realistic and sort of cartoony, which provides the ""Wow!!"" factor. And if Windows' ""Vista"" made you say ""Wow!"", you really should get out more!

And yet, the plot is probably the most simple I've heard of for many years. Five or six people are trapped in a room and have to get out, only there are traps that will kill you and the next room looks exactly the same as the one before apart from a different colour. Like a labyrinth. Like I said, do not expect any fascinating special effects or some nice settings or some great cinematography or (for that matter) some great acting or, coming to think about it, an elaborate plot. Just watch this for the *simple* plot that is very fascinating and if you don't expect too much I think you'll enjoy it. [Plot SPOILER revealed below.] I have to say, though, that the 'psycho-boy' ending was a bit of a cop out, is this the ending we wanted? Don't think so.

109,DavidSim240183,A highly original science fiction film.,10,6 January 2004,"When I first read about Cube in the Daily Mirror, the idea of the film intrigued me right from the offset. 7 strangers wake to find themselves in an enormous maze shaped like a giant cube. Some rooms are safe. Others are booby trapped. The methods of execution are particularly grisly (look what happens to Alderson).Considering this is a low budget film, not surprisingly the actors are a group of unknowns. When I saw it for the first time, the only person I recognised was Nicole de Boer (Leaven). She's best known as Ezri Dax in Deep Space Nine, and Sarah Bannerman in The Dead Zone.As the years went by, I gradually began to see some of the other actors in films too. The only other person I have seen in frequent films and TV series is Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin).The film begins inside the Cube, where one of the people, Alderson, wakes up. He is dressed in some overalls and has his name written on them. (Whoever put him here must know his name). He is only in the film for about three minutes, because as I mentioned before, he dies a very nasty death at the hands of one of the Cube's booby traps. I won't say how he dies though, because it has to be experienced. One of the best openings I have ever seen in a film.We switch then to the other people in the Cube. I will write their name, and a short description for them:Leaven: A student maths whiz, who comes in very handy when it comes to cracking the numbers in the Cube. (I will describe the numbers later).Worth: An architect who had something to do with the construction of the Cube.Holloway: A doctor who seems to be an ""expert"" on conspiracy theories (she is also paranoid and rather irritating at times).Quentin: A cop with a hot temper who is more of a threat then the Cube itself.Kazan: A man who is mentally handicapped, but is the key to their escape (I won't describe completely what his special talent is). His screaming when he is forced to do something he doesn't want to is annoying as well.Rennes: An escape artist who gives good advice about how to survive in the Cube.Who put these people here and why is a mystery. The possible suspects are endless. It could be anyone from the Government to aliens. None of them have any idea how they got there. As they try to get to grips with their situation, the tension begins to build slowly. The dimensions of the Cube, the seemingly endless rooms, not knowing who is an ally or enemy. It all begins to take its toll.There is a real claustrophobic feel, because each room is shaped like a cube too. Whoever designed the Cube (and I mean the filmmakers) was a genius. A truly three dimensional experience that thrusts our heroes into one potentially perilous situation after another. There are numbers too that have something to do with prime numbers, which are an important clue. My maths skills are abominable so I would never survive in the Cube.Power struggles. Suspicion on every side. This would unhinge anyone's mind if they were placed in the same environment. Although it has a low budget, the director, Vincenzo Natali made the wise move of introducing psychological tension into the mix. It doesn't just have to be blood and guts that frighten a viewer, but the genuine paranoia and mental anguish the characters are feeling. Look what happens to Quentin, and you will see how completely over the edge he goes.The acting and dialogue is a little more uneven. Quentin overacts, and Holloway is annoying when she is going on about the world being against them. Worth is an interesting man, who has nothing to live for outside the Cube, so wouldn't care anyway if they made it out alive. These are the setups for the tension and paranoia that will gradually turn them all against each other. Some of the clunky dialogue comes from speeches about how these people don't matter in the mainstream of things.Personally, I think the purpose of the Cube is an experiment, to see how these unimportant people will react to being placed in a nightmarish situation. The results are not encouraging. But still, this is a highly compelling film, and more unique then most sci-fi you see nowadays. I was on the edge of my seat to see if they would escape, but a lunatic like Quentin in their midst, and the dimensions of the Cube hinder their efforts at every turn.The words of wisdom from Rennes have stuck with me concerning survival (ironically just before his death) that I will quote them:""No more talking. No more guessing. Don't even think about anything that's not sitting right in front of you. That's the real challenge. You've got to save yourselves from yourselves.""That certainly applies to Quentin. The ending is a bit of an anticlimax, and I felt disappointed and still intrigued at the same time. It compelled me to ask questions about the Cube for days afterwards.The best sci-fi film since Alien.",Cube
110,nitzanhavoc,"Original, compelling, excellent!",8,28 April 2013,"Throughout the years, I've kept running into Cube on TV, but I've never watched it from beginning to end until just now. I'm not usually that big a fan of Sci-Fi films, but in this case I must make an exception, as Cube is simply spectacular. As a devout Horror fan, my favorite anthology is the Saw series, and watching Cube really give me a clue as to where it got its ideas from.The film has a very short exposition, basically showing us people stuck in the cube. Every room either has a death trap, or doesn't. The prisoners must figure out how to get out, or die trying. The screenplay/story is original, compelling, interesting and exquisitely smart, excellent job by the writers. We even get a few twists, though not really shocking ones, mostly about the group dynamics of the prisoners. Some smarter twists could have really made the film even better. The acting is excellent by the entire cast, all characters are portrayed perfectly. Personally I've been most impressed with Andrew Miller as Kazan. Making a single-location film is always a challenge, to which Cube has stood up in the best way possible.Cube leaves many questions asked, and I doubt the two sequels answer them. The audience is left to wonder, question, and fear. While not exactly a Horror film, Cube is definitely a masterpiece. Very very highly recommended!",Cube
111,nitzanhavoc,"To paraphrase Saucy Jack - ""Years from now people will look back and say that Cube gave birth to 21st century Psychological Horror"". It sure did.",8,29 March 2019,"I've always been a devout fan of story-centered Horror films with smart and surprising plot twists and endings. To me, these films (for instance many titles by James Wan) embody the perfect combination of Horror and Psychological Thriller (most titles of the Saw anthology come to mind as a shining example). As a fan of such, I must pay proper respects to Cube, which just might be the title that had originally presented this particular sub-genre years before the first Saw reinvented it (even though it sadly fails to deliver an actual plot twist).As the plot summary and trailers have most likely told you already - Cube begins, continues and ends with the struggle of six strangers who awake to a living nightmare in which they're trapped inside a giant maze rigged with traps. The way I see it, Cube relies on three main features. First, the film's main feature is deception, as everything we're made to think we know about each character on one hand and their devastatingly discomforting predicament on the other first comes into question and later, at times, shatters completely. This serves as a metonymic representation of the fact that nothing around is familiar, known of comprehendible, both in the maze and in the characters' lives as part of human society.The second feature is discomfort, which has become a key characteristic of many modern Horror films that have crossed the classical boundaries of a haunting ghost or a hunting killer. From the start, the main antagonist is the setting (i.e. the maze), into which the characters have been forced and out of which they barely have a prayer of escaping. As stress, fatigue and of course hunger and dehydration are gradually added to the equation - the characters become paranoid and distrustful, sometimes for good reasons. The genius single location and lack of any flashbacks and past/future scenes only serve to enhance the sensation of discomfort: there's nowhere and no time to which the characters can escape, the nightmare is real and is the only thing that exists for them.The third and less profound feature is the philosophical dimension added by the characters' different perceptions and attitudes regarding life's rules of conduct and terms of endeavor, so to say. As they discuss and relate their own individual explanation to their situation - questions of life, humanity and personality arise, making the viewer constantly think and ponder while following the characters' attempts at survival and escape. While this might have been considered a relief from the aforementioned sense of discomfort (since focusing on anything but the reality of the nightmarish predicament might give a false sense of hope) - it turns out it actually feeds the fear and despair, as each explanation is both realistic and authentic (to the extent you'd attribute logic and rationale to conspiracy theories and sci-fi scenarios) and more terrible than the other.The acting is professional and excellent, the story is original and innovative and the plot is compelling and suspenseful, always keeping the viewer on edge. Even the minimalistic soundtrack is great, although too much resembling a Slasher theme in my opinion. The only let down for me had been, as I mentioned in the beginning, the blunt lack of an actual plot twist, or an actual ending. While the open ending could be considered another element of discomfort and lack of clarity - I firmly believe a smart plot twist would have made this film perfect.And yet, made over two decades ago - Cube still sets a standard few Horror and Psychological Thriller titles manage to meet today. It isn't frightening of that scary (as it doesn't really rely on fear), but a true psychological Horror combining discomfort, torture, despair and pursuit which manage to exquisitely deliver every stressful and agonizing sensation to the viewing audience. While this is solely my personal opinion - I can't recommend this film enough, even to those who aren't particularly fond of Horror films.",Cube
112,blackmamba99971,Quite the mind bender,10,16 November 2010,"This was one of the most original films in the nineties. A cube which has a mystery of traps and rooms which account over 17000. A group of people are trapped inside for unknown reasons except what they keep to themselves with secrets. One a Doctor, another a Cop. And a math wizard who seems to know how the cube functions for traps. But that is a one sided coin. During the groups travels through the cube they come across a savant. Now the fight to survive becomes even more desperate when the group begins to break down the moral barrier. Frustrations and anger fuel each member as they all come closer to the exit. Yet one member had the knowledge because he was the creator for the outer shell. Now as the race quickens, the cop loses his cool, murders and tries to take revenge for the group leaving him behind. Through this, the savant has a miraculous gift to see numbers to lead the less vicious part of the group to the exit itself. A cube, A bridge, and an exit makes this film more than worth watching, it has psychological aspects to delve into the mind, it has action of each trap which harbour the most cruel and gross ways to die. This is a very good movie to watch for those who like the mind teasers. Recommended.",Cube
113,PyrolyticCarbon,"Interesting concept, although characterisation is shallow and rushed.",6,11 April 2004,"I had been told great things about this movie, and things started well. It was claustrophobic and tense, with confusion and suspicion rife among the characters, a few fantastically fiendish deaths, and there it stopped for me.The characters were extremely stereotypical, and they were revealed all too quickly it seemed rushed. There wasn't any feeling of any kind for the characters, good or bad, and no empathy means that the key plot points are lost as this film is all about the characters and their interactions.With a more carefully selected set of characters, this could really have been a great film. As it is, it's good, but you feel it's missing it's point.",Cube

A group of strangers wake up to find themselves in a huge cube consisting of equal-sized rooms, some of which contain fatal traps. They don't know each other, why they're there, where they are or how to get out. As the film passes, the group are inevitably picked off and we learn more of who they are. There's much to be commended, especially in an era of cinema replete with prequels, cinematic universes, backstory and origin stories where everything that can be explained is explained. Though this film has a (kind of) tidy ending, there's much we don't know; a lot is left to our imagination, for us to fill in the blanks - or to leave them blank if we want to. Is the film about conspiracy theories; a Lord of the Flies style experiment in human savagery; an exercise in sadistic ways of dying? Other things? All of them? None of them? That's the appeal and potential frustration of the film. Despite a script that is at times badly flawed and some very limited performances, this is a film that works because of what it doesn't tell us, making the best of a clearly limited budget. Sometimes less really is more.",Cube

116,supertom-3,Cult Classic Sci-Fi!!,10,22 June 2004,"SPOILER: Vincenzo Natali. Funny sounding name right? Well just a little funny. Keep that name in your mind though over the next few years. After this film the Cube, Natali's follow up was the superb Cypher. He seems to be a master of a difficult genre, Sci-Fi. In a genre that is primarily known for having a high pap ratio, the fact that Natali's first two features have been cult classic science fiction movies then bodes well for Sci-fi fanatics who will eagerly anticipate his next movie. The Cube is a superbly crafted low budget film. On a shoestring budget and a dangerously basic premise full of intrigue, the film succeeds because of imaginative effects and taut directions as well as a superbly written script, delving into the human psyche in such an extreme situation. The plot is basically thus: A group of strangers wake in a cube room. They don't know where they are or how they got there but they know they must find a way out. It also transpires that when they leave each room the enter another room that is virtually identical in look. There will perhaps be a different colour in the lighting. The must find their way out before they starve tp death or go nuts, but to add to their woes, it seems that some of the rooms are booby trapped, ranging from sound activated, to pressure activated traps. They soon discover that each of them has a specific gift that can perhaps hold the key to their escape. There is a maths genius who may hold the key to discovering a way out. The rooms are numbered and the numbers could signify the type of room but also a map. The film is excellent and just when they think they have figured it out the Cube bites them in the behind. The dynamic of the characters is excellent as inevitably some go crazy. I do think that for a film shot for less than 300,000 dollars this is amazing looking. It works well for a film that is set in the same environment for the 90 minutes of the film. I have to say this film is one of those pleasant surprises that comes from nowhere and when word of mouth finally gets to you, please listen! ****",Cube
117,charchuk,Intriguing concept ruined by terrible script,7,17 March 2007,"Interesting, suspenseful flick, with some great direction, hampered by terrible acting and atrocious dialogue. The overall concept is an intriguing one, and could have made for a better film in the hands of a competent writer, but instead the screenplay is filled with idiotic characters and ludicrous dialogue. Combined with some terrible overacting by most of the cast, and the dialogue-heavy scenes become painful to watch. Fortunately, the 'action' sequences redeem the film, as they are shot well and become incredibly suspenseful - especially the scene with the quiet room. Some great gore effects and a fitting ambiguous ending make it a worthwhile viewing.",Cube
118,rooee,Enjoyment squared,6,12 May 2013,"It was writer-director Vincenzo Natali's entertaining and bizarre Splice that drew my attention to his earlier work, and this is his debut feature: a low-budget Canadian sci-fi set entirely in an enormous cube, containing a series of smaller, room-sized cubes. A group of strangers awaken with no memory of how they became trapped. They need to find a way out - except some rooms are booby-trapped. Tension, conflict and madness ensues.Some have remarked upon the acting quality in the film, although I rather enjoyed the larger-than-life reactions of the characters. The film unashamedly embraces its own B-movie silliness. As the post-Saw horror genre has seemingly become a contest of escalating cruelty and gross-out money shots, a film whose thrills rely on inventive camera angles, imaginative narrative twists, and scarily unpredictable character mood swings seems almost quaint. But it works, thanks to its devotion to the puzzle at its heart and the descending psychology of those trying to solve it.The production design is simple (Natali's team built one cube and changed the wall colour to represent different rooms) and the make-up is effectively gruesome. It's the kind of movie where you'll be constantly questioning character motivations, but surrender to the ride and you'll find yourself enjoying a very neat cult gem.",Cube

Unfortunately the execution just fails to pay off sufficiently for me to call it brilliant. I think the dialogue comes over as a little dated and that does let it down somewhat. Also the twist at the end was a tad predictable. Even so, I can't help but like this film; I think it appeals to the mathematician in me (don't let that put you off by the way). You'll know what I mean if you've seen it.

Each has a skill that becomes clear when they must band together to get out: a cop, a math wiz, a building designer, a doctor, an escape master, and a disabled man. Each plays a part in their thrilling quest to find answers as to why they've been imprisoned.I rented this having heard good things but not knowing what to expect and it turned out to be one of the most original and intelligent film I've seen in a long time. Vincenzo Natali (Remember this name, it'll be big one day!)does a fantastic job with the atmosphere, suspense and tension. I kept guessing (Wrong, naturally) what great new plot twist would be introduced into the story. The cast of character actors help the story greatly. Most people who don't like ""Cube"" blame the actors; I disagree. I thought the cast did a great job, especially David Hewlett, Andrew Miller and Wayne Robson. The characters were great and well-rounded enough to be real people, not the product of a writer's imagination. While most sci-fi films now-a-days try to wow you with unconvincing computer-generated special effects, ""Cube"" relies on thought-provoking dialouge and characters. That's not to say that the effects in the film aren't good (In fact, for a film made for so little money, many of them were quite excellent.), but there not ""In-your-face"" and meld into the story perfectly. Mark Korven's score was excellent. It's atmospheric, void of melody, but it's extremely effective and haunting. Why isn't the score available commercially? I want it!!!The ending was PERFECT. Sure, it leaves you with an intense ""What? That's it?"" feeling, but that's whats so great about it, the makers avoided the urge to tell us every detail and leave most of it up to our imagination.""Cube"" is a brilliant piece of low-budget film-making. It's haunting, intelligent, well-made. If you've seen ""Cube"", I recommend you read the books ""House of stairs"" by William Sealtor and ""House of doors"" by Brian Lumley, both have remarkable similarities to this film. 10/10.ABOUT THE DVD: This DVD review is based on the old (And apparently now defunct) Trimark DVD, not the more recent Lion's gate signature DVD. I may right a review of that DVD at a later point in time. The picture in ""Cube"" is presented in a decent widescreen format. I noticed several minor problems while watching the film, including softness (This is especially noticeable during the scenes in the red cubes),edge enhancement,pressing artifacts and bland flesh tones. Otherwise, this ain't a bad picture,with bright colors and minimal grain. The ultra-stereo sound is great.Surround sound effects are well-used, plentiful and effective, with clear and crisp dialouge. There are some great extras on the disc, including a commentary with star Hewlett, director Natali and co-writer Andre Bijelic. This is a fun, enjoyable and informative track. The three talk about how they conceptualized the film and behind-the-scenes stories, among other things. Next up are three deleted scenes, and even though there shown in there ""Rough-cut"" form, there still pretty interesting. Natali provides an optional commentary for these scenes. Also included here are story boards (Some of which offer a scene comparison), effects art-work, production design sketches, a theatrical trailer and french and Spanish (But strangely no available English) subtitles.

What?I don't mind films where you interpret your own ending at all, but this was silly. If you take it to the extreme, it won't be long until a film where people interpret the whole thing.I hated Blair Witch Project, due partly to the unresolved ending, but at least with that, if anyone tells you about the film, most peoples interpretations, though different, will tend to resolve most of the issues. This didn't.I can see all the messages behind this. The reflections of society, the anger & hostility, the many prison allusions etc etc. That was all very good. But there must have been a better way of tackling it whilst at least tying up some of questions but keeping the same themes.
I didn't have a problem with never finding out how they arrived in the cube. That point gradually became less & less relevant but they could have resolved the why? & the who? questions.I would rather watch a crap film with a botched rushed ending than a magnificent film (which is what this was) with that same ending. The Quentin character also lost this film a mark. He'd become a pain up the arse by the end.Still, the whole concept is amazing, I was gripped throughout and am now excited for the Cube 2 film & also seeking out films on a similar concept to this.

One of the greatest cult movies ever made.,10,28 May 2015,"It's really inspiring how you can make such a awe-inspiring movie with a marvelously low budget.This movie centers between a group of people: Worth, Leaven, Quentin, Holloway, Kazan, Alderson and Rennes. Or, well, they are all the people winding up in the cube at least. Two of them die pretty quickly.Having one of the most memorable and creepiest opening scene to a movie I've ever seen, the movie starts off doomsday-like already at the start. While this movie does have a mystery, it's not the main thing making this movie so fantastic. The visuals, the characters, the sharp and funny dialogue, the atmosphere... these are all the factors for a classic piece of horror. The color palettes and the cinematography is a joy to the movies. I could watch this movie plenty of times if just to look at imagery so beautiful I am irritatedly jealous. The music for this movie is good too. Out of all the characters, Holloway is my least favorite since Nicky Guadagni's acting is pretty inconsistent. But other than that, the acting is shockingly good for a B grade horror movie. Andrew Miller gives a great impression of a delirious, but still smart, autistic individual, David Hewlett is great as the anti-hero Worth, Nicole De Boer does a solid job as Leaven... and best of all is Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin. Not only is his character the most fascinating in the whole movie, but his acting is so versatile and believable it's sad how he never had a chance to win an Oscar. While this movie is not outright terrifying, the movie really builds up the suspense well. And while they are not many, some moments are quite startling. And how can I praise this movie without naming some of the hilarious lines? For not being a horror comedy, it sure is funny. The balance between pure horror and comedic horror is a fine line, but the comedy was never overdone, so it was a movie making me laugh while still managing to take it seriously.The best lines:""The only reason you even exist is because I keep you! I know your type. No kids, no man to fuc'k you. So you go around outraged, sticking your nose up people's assholes.

Oh sure, the idea of putting people into a situation where they start getting killed one by one as they try to find a way to save themselves from a mysterious danger is not new, and there are other horror movie clichés here too, but there is enough difference to separate this from other horror films.Cube can strike one as both dumb and smart.It is about a group of people stuck inside a deadly puzzle. The way the story is handled in terms of the puzzle progression and the ""solutions"" to the puzzle is pretty interesting. The way the characters develop is interesting.However, the dialogue takes a dip in quality. It is not very original and just does not flow very well. It is horror movie writing, that is to say, not good.Visually, the movie is most distinguishable. The whole thing takes place inside the cube puzzle, which looks remarkable and gives the film a most alien look. This must have been money saving as well, because all you really need is 2 cubes and a few colorful lamps to light them.The film also uses some CGI, which is absolutely terrible most of the time, but was probably impressive when this movie first came out.The cameraman has a tendency to use angled or angling close ups of people's faces, which in combination with the bulging eyes of the actor Maurice Dean Wint further contributes to the alien look that this film has.I want to give this film a higher praise but some of the acting and the dialogue was irritating.

And suddenly, the guy who almost died a couple of minutes ago is there with them, came out without making any noise, and killed the woman. That screwed the whole movie for me! Not only it was unbelievable, but was impossible too. Why did they even do it? To get some more action from the movie.",Cube

The concept is good, but the execution is terrible, for example the dialogues. If we do not learn who built the cube and what for, and why those people are in it, the whole story is pointless. Also, that two of them are such maths geniuses (one of them even autistic) is just too convenient - and boring. Pity.",Cube

The acting,although not that bad,is hampered by some really stupid and lame dialogue.Because it's a sort of horror movie it should be,but the dialogue here is rather pretentious.The main theme is pretty clever but it could have been better worked out.After a while you kind of get fed up with again another cube.The characters a very straight forward and from the word go you know that the disabled guy will live on.The only ""surprise"" was the death of the maths student.This wasn't really necessary,but in the line of the movie it goes without saying that the autistic man is actually the smartest although he seems very much a Dustin Hoffman imitation with his numerical brilliance.For a debut it is definitely not bad and it keeps one watching. 7/10",Cube
145,andy-227,I saw an ad for it on the sci-fi channel...,1,29 August 1999,"I saw an ad for it on the sci-fi channel, and managed to catch it on it's television premiere. As usual, the sci-fi channel loves crap, so I wasn't expecting a very good movie. It's not as bad as some of the other things I've seen in the past. Basically, it's for idiots. The whole movie is mainly putting human beings into a pseudo rat maze, and watching them run about until they die. Whoopee. I'm excited. What turned me off were the characters. The characters make Matthew Broderick in ""Godzilla"" look like Han Solo! They're that bad. Part of what makes them so bad is the corny acting. The lead character seems to be the likeable leader. Next thing you know, he's trying to kill everybody. Worse yet, the most annoying character of the film, the retard, is the sole survivor. His repetitive squealing noises serve to lower your overall enjoyment of the film. I thought the sets were good, and the opening sequence exhibited some cool exploits of gore. From then on, the film spiraled downhill. What's really scary about this film is that a lot of people really liked it! I don't understand. What's to like? Somebody tell me. It'll be a long while before anyone gets me to like this crock of shit!",Cube
146,lagriff05,Nail biting suspense and a lot of fun.,8,31 July 2009,"This is the movie that pretty much started the whole SAW thing, along with David Fincher's Se7en, so you might be inclined to hate it for that, but it's just too good to argue with. First, the bad: I thought this movie dawdled a little too much on time-passing sequences in which nothing happened, which could have easily been filled up with more of the edgy and dark character-driven tension the rest of the movie so thrived on. A few things seemed a little too convenient, too, like the retarded guy knowing how to square numbers or whatever (this is partially explained by Cube Zero, but that's no excuse; it was poorly written). And I did not think Quentin's character was as believable as it could have been - he switched moods a little too fast.However, everything else about this just rules. It isn't an amazing film, but it is really good, with the acting being surprisingly good (especially compared to Cube Zero) and the drama and tension being extremely well executed. The characters were given distinctive and interesting personalities and were only detailed enough for the story to work. The traps and the gore are well done, as they are not the focal point of the story and don't need to be - we're scared more by what's outside the cube instead of inside it! So this is a great film, immensely entertaining and always keeping you on the edge of your seat, certainly worth watching for fans of horror, science fiction or just gripping, nail-biting suspense in general. Get it now.",Cube
147,daggersineyes,Wasted time,3,9 April 2014,"After a lot of hype I decided it was time to give this movie a whirl & went in with reasonably high expectations, but was sadly disappointed. I really am not sure why it's getting such good reviews. Yes it's basic premise has an element of interest to it and it's not bad for such a low budget. But I've seen far far better low budget movies than this and they don't have any of that pretentious ""arent we so gosh darned clever"" air of this one. And quite frankly, no it's not that clever.The characters were one dimensional and exceptionally annoying, the acting was terrible not helped by an abysmal script. Honestly that's gotta be some of the WORST acting I've seen especially from the cop & the doctor. Good lord. I partly blame the director who shoulda known better and either not directed them to act that way or prevented them from doing it. They were woeful. The others were hardly brilliant either but were at least tolerable. The basic premise worked for a while but then just got tedious and repetitious and ran out of steam to the point where I started skipping ahead & getting impatient for it to get to ""the point"" or at least some sort of new direction, development in story or character or resolution. Anything! The mathematical principles and so-called philosophy were laughable and the ending was absolutely ridiculous. Why would that guy do that? There was no reason to kill at that point. And yeah, you could argue he went nuts but that's really a cop out. How did he find that spot anyway? He had no mathematical skills & no genius autistic kid to help him. Plus he was nuts. How could he possibly have figured out something so complex without all the assistance and not been killed along the way? Ludicrous. Nothing made sense by the end of it and frankly I didn't care by then about any of them so it made no difference to me other than being a cheap way to treat the viewer after such a long tedious movie. The ""lone survivor"" cliché was also tragically predictable. If you're easily impressed by gobbledegook masquerading as clever philosophy then you might enjoy this. But if you're looking for tension, atmosphere, thrills, suspense, horror, sophisticated plot, good character development, great cinematography or excellent direction go elsewhere pilgrim.Had potential - didn't go anywhere with it.",Cube
148,Horrorible_Horror_Films,Extreemly well written movie,9,28 February 2007,"I love movies thats are like this, this is in many ways an anti-Hollywood movie, it has a small cast, no extras and a small set, original screenplay that I though had to be based off of a short story or novel but it wasn't - it was just a really good screenplay, a great idea. This movie succeeds very well exactly becuz its not a stupid indie horror crap nor a blockbuster bloated Hollywood hunk of garbage. I mean how much better can you get - take a handful of people, trap them in a cube make them figure out a way out, good twist with the characters and who gets out alive - of course it could have sucked and been stupid and boring with a premise like that but it wasn't it was really well executed.

149,Semisonic,Blunt and badly delivered,5,22 June 2015,"Cube is one of the movies that brag being not what they seem. This sure is true, because one has to be insane to take a movie with such a bizarre and contrived setting at face value.And of course it's a metaphor. At least it's what the creators of Cube wanted to think they were making. When you do something utterly unrealistic and make your characters behave in the most unlikely and unnatural way imaginable, you must believe you're conveying some sort of a message via those acts.Unfortunately, the director and the screenwriter seem to forget what a metaphor is. Metaphor is a second layer, concealed and subtle, of anything that is still rather believable, albeit shallow, on the surface. You can't simply blurt out some message you consider important out of the blue and think it adds artistic value to your product. But here, this is exactly what happens. If the movie wants to make an allegory of society as a giant machine in which people are just little cogs, it does no more than just make one of the characters say something like ""we're nothing but cogs spinning in this huge machine"". If it wants to claim that life is a headless beast with no mastermind but human stupidity, it also bluntly says it out loud. That's not a metaphor, and it's definitely not art. It's just ravings of a madman, which can be enlightening to some who are desperate to find a hidden meaning in everything, but are still more or less a pointless nonsense if observed on a long run.But the script is not the only weak point of this movie. The acting which starts as just blah, goes to laughable to hysterical to preposterous. Obviously, in a movie that views itself as a naked metaphor, the characters are all but walking archetypes, but, with the delirious approach the film has taken, they are hardly more than caricatures of the types they were supposed to enact. And that is really sad, because no matter how much promise your idea shows, when it's delivered that bad one is only left to shrug and wonder on what drugs the film makers were.Still, Cube undeniably has at least one true virtue. Which is to be an example for the new and aspiring cinema artists of what can happen when you take a promising premise and screw it up with a bland and uninspiring implementation.",Cube
150,allyjack,Philosophy-friendly suspense yarn,6,14 July 1999,"The movie has the taste not to overplay the potentially facile philosophical implications of its premise - a diverse group, in a stripped-down environment the origin of which they have no knowledge, finding that they each have a particular skill relevant to effecting their escape...if they can conquer their differences. Through generally unforced writing, canny acting, and surprisingly striking production design given the very low budget, the movie makes it as a suspense yarn. The limited possibilities of its premise start to become more obvious as it goes on, and it lacks the wild idiosyncrasy and fluency of something like Pi. But it's no surprise that it's reportedly been a big hit in France - it lends itself very effectively to a high-school essay-level of philosophizing; and it's no doubt canny (if dramatically a bit of a letdown) that the movie refrains from showing us what's outside the cube (except, as per one memorable exchange, human stupidity).",Cube
151,Mickey Knox,surprisingly good,7,15 March 2001,"Low budget movies, with unknown actors or unknown directors, can often be huge surprises for us all. It's exactly what happens with CUBE. Who would have thought that the first movie ever made by the director, Nicoli, a film with a budget smaller than half a million, a sum that Tom Cruise by example wins in a few days of work, could be so good??Well it is. Cube is a psychological analysis about the way people act and change in difficult situations, actually in this case - trapped in a cube they don't know anything about. The actors are surprisingly good, the film is very tensed, the dialogue is well written... Of course there are bad things about it - you can't reach perfection from your first attempt. Maybe the worst thing is that we don't get any explanations concerning the reason and by whom the Cube was built.All in all, a great watch.

152,Angel_Peter,Great idea but no script really,3,2 January 2010,"It starts with some persons that is trapped in a lot of cube rooms. No explanation but they guess they are meant to get out and there is some traps in some of the identical rooms, so they try travel through them to get out.This seems reasonable as a viewer. The prisoners had different abilities. So they chose somewhat to work together, some of them was more interested in annoying the others than doing anything useful though. But as the movie continues the persons become more and more unrealistic. And you begin to wish some of them would say I have the ability of spontaneous combustion and then use their gift. In the end some of them indeed suddenly change personality.I could have lived with those flaws if we had just got a reason or hint for what was going on. But soon you begin to wonder who build this? Who operates this? What is the purpose. You sit through all the movie to get these informations that will make the movie have a meaning. But nothing comes and in the you realize: ohh the instructor and script writer did apparently not know what this was about either.So it ends with a good idea being wasted. Who the hell would secretly build a 100 * 100 meter secret construction to kill 6 indifferent persons when 6 bullets in the head could have done the same and was much easier to conceal. Since they give no reason whatsoever for the existence of the cube that is a very valid question.For me it is an attempt to make an intelligent splatter. If you love splatters then you can find a lot movies with better visuals and more killings.If you love a good story then stay clear. This one sucks big time.",Cube
153,schroeder-gustavo,Has a lot of unused potential...,5,7 June 2015,"Cube is a movie that apparently has a cult following out there. So is it worth watching? The movie is overrated if you ask me. The premise of the film is great and really original and the movie DOES do some things very well, some of these things are the creation of the set and the suspense the movie creates almost throughout. Also some of the kills were pretty awesome and original, so that's always good to have in a horror film. However, I do believe the movie does get more things wrong than right: the acting is pretty terrible and the dialog clichéd. Also sometimes it seems the writers rushed into getting the characters into certain situations too quickly, which creates some pretty weird and uncomfortable dialog. Another thing the movie does wrong is how they handle the moving through the maze and it gets way too brainy and illogical at the same time and it copies Rain Man. It does. The ending where the crazy black guy kills two of the other characters is also pretty unrealistic. I mean, how the hell didn't they hear him get in the same room as them? It was established several times during the movie that the doors are extremely freaking' loud when they open and close. By the way that guy's situation escalated pretty quickly: he went from being the hero to Jack Torrance in like nothing. I have to say I did enjoy some of Cube and yeah Saw may be kind of a rip-off of this, but Saw executes its ideas way better than this. Cube is a let down and, although with potential, ends up being a pretty generic late 90's horror flick with bad acting.",Cube
154,jake-law123,Perfect concept for the independent production it came from.,7,28 January 2015,"Out of Saw, Phone Booth, Buried, or any other independent thrillers, this one is by far the most unique. The concept alone is enough to give it the edge. With Night of the Living dead related cheesiness, lame acting, semi-lame screenplay, weird sets etc, the premise alone is enough for it to get by. 6 strangers wake up in a cube shaped room, with no idea how they got there. Every other room they visit via airlock hatch on the walls leads to an identical room with a different color. Realizing that most of the rooms are booby trapped, they must put their heads together to find a way out of the deathtrap.The characters, though aren't acted well, are entertainingly over the top. Worth and Kazaan are the best. The question of who is doing this and why pops up a lot in the group. Later on you realize that Worth was hired by an unknown to design the outer shell of the compound, and the original purpose is unknown, which is quite fascinating. It's a film with no answers, it's just in your face is all you get.The filming is done super quirky. It's got still shots of sets, and very draggy camera movement, it makes me feel like i'm in less produced and badly acted Stanley Kubrick film. The booby traps are pretty cool as well, making for some entertaining scenes. Even though it isn't the smartest thriller, it's definitely a fascinating concept that is carried by over the top actors, insane sets, and interesting concepts of humanity.",Cube

There is also one character who is for the most part useless and does this annoying screeching thing. I wanted to step through my television and beat him to a bloody mess. Now for the positives.

It probably proves that the audiences are expecting something else than stupid Hollywood blockbusters fare. This one is very much a play on Sarte's ""Huis clos"" (""L'enfer, c'est les autres"" - ""Hell is the other people"") infused with thriller and sometimes basic horror overtones. The scenario seems to have been written by a philosopher and a mathematician, and the ending seems to enter religious parable territory (""Happy are the feeble-minded""). I thought the pretty thin premise would wear thin after an exciting first half-hour, but the movie never lets go, helped by a very strong cast. Sometimes, there are artificial or too obvious ways to highten the tension (Like killing first the prisoner who seems the most likely to survive and a sudden incursion in Friday the 13th territory, etc) but this is understandable for a first effort and gives some naive, passionate flavor to the proceedings, compared to computer-generated Hollywoodian scenarios. Besides, this proves you don't have to make a billion-sized blockbuster choke-full of special effects to build up a good movie.",Cube
157,marc5477,Insanely overrated,2,12 March 2015,"Yet another psychological thriller type movie that takes itself too seriously. This one presents a bunch of folks thrown into a puzzle with traps. The premise is fine, nothing new even for its time, but still fine if the acting/characters were not so bad. Sorry but the characters in this movie were completely unbelievable from the cop and doctor to the losers of society who magically happen to recall their math and grow a backbone. Not to mention that super computer brain savant. All the characters had personalities that were totally unbelievable. Even if we were to assume the cop was lying and was not really a cop, he was clearly lucid and his actions did not support his goal of survival. The doctor is your token extreme bleeding heart retard, which no doctor can be after a few years of work. The two whiny idiots turn out to be a number theory mathematician and the other does a full 180 in personality (yet remains completely mopey) going from passive a-hole to stud willing to stand up against injustice, in a matter of hours.Aside from the character, the premise (again) was actually OK.

There's also some CGI in the film but it's kept to a minimum.  Most of it looks like it was done the old fashioned prosthetics way.  Yes !A group of people are placed are placed inside a large complex filled with thousands of movable cubes, that move around in a Rubik like fashion.  If you remember Rubik's Cubes from the late-70s, early 80s then you'll get the idea.The opening scene where a prisoner is sliced in a grid like fashion by a razor sharp, faster that a speeding bullet grid, is awesome!  You can actually see big chunks of body parts and organs falling and hitting the floor, with the slippery sounds of meat going 'thunk, thunk' in the background.  Slice it and dice it, baby.  Cool scene.Another excellent gore scene is when we see Rennes the escape artist get it in the face with a stream of squirting acid as he drops down into an adjoining cell.  The front half of his face starts to melt off with his front teeth exposed.  No CGI.  It's one of the best prosthetics effects I've ever seen in a film !!They all work together in order to break the code in order to get out of there.  That is, until Quentin the cop loses it and starts killing off some his fellow prisoners, like Dr, Holloway for one...  You see, the authorities (who we never see) put them all in there for a purpose.  To see if they can get out by placing not only the cube's mechanical obstacles in the way, but their own personalities and backgrounds as well.The whole set has a cool techno-industrial look to it, with lots of colored ambience and plot cues that are intelligently written.  I fully recommend this to anyone who wants a mature sci-fi plot.I didn't care for the ending so it knocks it down a point, but it's still something that I would consider keeping in my DVD sci-fi library.8 out of 10 .",Cube

One is a cop; another is obsessed with conspiracy theories; the youngest is a maths genius; there's a con man and an inmate with a dark secret. There's also an autistic young man who ups the tension several notches when our heroes have to go from one cell to another - except any sound they make could result in instant death from acoustically primed traps. The script is fresh and original; the cast likeable and engaging with the added bonus that none of them carries the baggage of several similar sci-fi offerings to interrupt your suspension of disbelief. Having seen this in the same week as the yawnsome Arnie offering End of Days, there's no doubt that this is the stronger film made for a fraction of the budget and with some far better actors. The movie looks great with the pacing and action never hindered by the rather claustrophobic setting. There's also a highly addictive soundtrack which has all the impact of a waking dream.
Nicole de Boer as the brainy Leaven is an attractive heroine without having the jaw dropping charm of Gillian Anderson. Director Vincenzo Natali also looks like being a name to watch although it's a pity that with a larger budget and more expansive sets, his talent could be diluted by a broader canvas.

That's exactly where this films strength lies, you are trapped throughout along with the characters. You don't even get to glimpse the outside world at the beginning. Instead you are thrust straight into the disturbing and claustrophobic plot. If you thought that the truman show was smart or original then think again... If you are after gore then you'll get plenty of the red stuff. If you're after laughs then sure, there's one or two... but most of all, if you are after nightmares and thoughts plagued for days with the intricacies of a tidy, intelligent, and utterly edge of seat movie then this is the film for you. 5 out of 5 just for not pandering to the masses.",Cube
162,imagiking,Cube: Full of Holes,4,2 April 2010,"A low budget Canadian psychological thriller, Cube has garnered a cult following and something of a legacy in popular culture. After a long time, I finally got around to seeing this interesting looking film today.Deeply mysterious, Cube chronicles the story of seven different people as they travel through an apparently endless system of interlinked cube structures with six doors each to adjacent cubes. Relying on each others' individual characteristics and skills to get them through, they desperately attempt to escape their geometric hell.With a single claustrophobic set used for shooting , one undeniable thing about Cube is the originality of its premise. Reworking the concept of the maze thriller in all sorts of new dimensions, it brings an interesting newness to the subgenre. The potential presented in the early scenes of the film is large; the opening scene immensely entertaining and indicative of good things to come from the original and intriguing concept. The implementation of this idea is, however, cripplingly flawed. Suffering painfully all the faults of clunky and unrealistic dialogue, the film does little to improve it with some substandard performances. The characters, though mildly interesting, seem to react in entirely absurd ways at times, doing much to detract from the audience sympathy vote: Kazan, an autistic character, is often just offensively portrayed; Leaven, the ""math whiz"", takes her time in trying to decide if multiples of 5 and 2 are prime numbers. The film is full of holes and massive flaws, turning it from a film of considerable potential to, at times, an infuriatingly contrived work. All that aside, it is actually quite enjoyable once you accept and expect its regular absurdity. Plot twists are painfully obvious, but the path to them is at least a fun one to tread, some of the tensions rising between characters interesting, if not effective or believable. Though it does little to establish itself as a particularly good movie, it's at least not a terrible one.With flaws aplenty, many of them just silly and stupid, Cube falls flat on its face more than once, suffering regularly from its less than convincing dialogue and unintentionally funny developments. Entertaining all the same, it's certainly original.",Cube
163,tubby1,Not rounded,5,24 January 2010,"The Cube is original and credit can be given for its clever resolving of how to escape the predicament of the Cube. However, for all its anxious interplay it just feels rather frugal both in script and appearance.The film is able to project the feel of claustrophobia and delusion rather well in its short period of running time, we are never able to escape the constant of the Cube and its horrifying predicament. The Cube and its purpose are never satisfactorily resolved leaving you to determine the where and whys, which may frustrate some.Unfortunately, the acting seems to be a contest of wills, each and every actor trying to out do one another with emotion. At points in the film you are at the opposite end to their projected emotional outpourings. The script is rather threadbare on providing a succinct or logical discussion of their predicament preferring stereotypical interplay and physical violence and language. More time should have been given to other areas of discussion if it was to propel itself to a sci-fi with more bite but maybe that was not its purpose.The Cube is an okay film but for all its hard-work it is rather frugal looking. The Cube tries valiantly to be a film with depth but its lack of purposeful debate, stereotypical characters and at times woeful acting make it a film which never fulfilled its possible potential.",Cube

165,BeanieCore,A highly influential cult classic.,9,29 October 2021,"For a modestly budgeted, first time directorial effort, ""Cube"" is one of the most influential horror films of all time. It led to the popularization of Kafkaesque, one-room settings, elaborate death traps and deconstructions of human nature using simplistic premises. Films such as ""Saw"", ""Escape Room"" and countless others, owe a great debt to this indie classic. And it still holds up as a terrifically suspenseful, thought-provoking and disturbing film to this day.Beneath it's deceptively simple plot, this film is first and foremost a study of humanity. Inside the confines of the cubed walls, the characters grapple with questions and moral quandaries that are universal. Why are we here? What is the purpose of our presence? Who put us here? How do we get out of the cycle? Can we trust others? Besides it's inventive gore and consistently building tension, the entire film is an allegory for the human condition. It asks us to question whether or not we are any less trapped and confused than the characters on screen. It's witty, nihilistic dialogue also makes some interesting socio-political observations. But besides all of these more high-minded aspects, it's completely effective as a simple horror/thriller as well. The death traps are fiendish and unpredictable. And the claustrophobic atmosphere of the sickeningly lit rooms is urgent and suffocating. One is never sure what might happen next, and viewers are kept on their toes throughout.The cast is mostly decent, although the melodramatic acting may sometimes rub some viewers the wrong way. But the characters are well-drawn, relatable and likeable. And while the ending continues to be a matter of contention for audiences, I wouldn't want the film to end any other way. The old adage that ""sometimes, what we don't see, is more interesting than what we do"" holds true here. And this was never meant to be a film about answers. It's entirely about the journey. And what a journey it is.",Cube

In a way, it is a predecessor to TV's ""Survivor"" in which the people each have a skill that can help them survive and possibly get them out.  It all comes down to human emotions and confrontations that get in the way of progress.  It's a talky film, but that's the point-- figuring situations and dealing with different personalities is inevitable to any group.  The solving of problems becomes very complex, but the viewer doesn't have to worry...let the characters figure it out as we go along for the ride.  While so many sci-fi films want to wow you with effects, this film does something more challenging--it makes you think.  With its limited budget and digital effects in use even before Titanic glorified them, Cube still proves itself as one of the more original and intelligent sci-fi films of the last decade, with a cult status already going strong.

I thought this would be a feature length version of the 'Twilight Zone' greats dealing with paranoia and an unseen, trapping presence. Give me Kafka tension any day. But what destroys this are several inexcusable elements. The first is really, really bad acting, particularly that of the cop and the doctor. The second is writing that begins realistically, and then veers headlong into pseudo-meaningful rubbish. Most unforgivable,though, is the famous ending of nothingness.

173,GuyCC,Clever and Inventive.,8,11 March 2007,"I was just introduced to ""The Cube"", a low budget sci-fi film that had so much more to say than the standard sci-fi films that are put out recently. It's actually a relief to find a story with something to say other than total reliance on pretty CG eye candy.""The Cube"" tells the story of a group of what essentially are prisoners trapped in an hi-tech deathtrap for no apparent reason, by no explainable jailer. And in that same explanation, the purpose behind the cube becomes apparent: It does serve a purpose, whether it is merely to entertain the psychopathic whims of a person/corporation with too much time and money or their hands, or an experiment designed to foster the breakdown of basic decency in humankind, and bring out the worst in people. Despite all the numerous and gruesome traps in each smaller cube, they prove to be the least of the threats within.The story can be taken with a lot of meanings. Some literal, some double, and some are never explained at all. Some story aspects, like the Cube itself, just ARE. And instead of feeling like the story was underdeveloped, or shortchanged by the need of more explanation, you're left with a sense of curiosity as to what really happened to bring all of these characters and factors together. Just when the viewer thinks it understands something, the story, like the cube itself, changes and becomes deeper.All in all, ""The Cube"" was a fascinating film. I understand that it's followed by two sequels, and I'll be approaching them wondering if they'll add on or take away from the simplistic intrigue of this movie. But as a stand alone film, ""The Cube"" will definitely have you talking. And thinking.And it's good to see a film like that again.",Cube

175,darkjosh,"Absorbing, Tense, Smart Sci-Fi Thriller",9,14 December 2000,"Vincenzo Natali's Cube is a thoroughly absorbing, tense, nail-biting, and wholly original sci-fi thriller soaked in adrenaline.Cube is about a handful of people who awaken to find themselves in a maze of cubes that are identical but for their colors: some are orange, green, red, or blue.  As they move about the cubes, they discover that some are equipped with deadly, sadistic traps.The power of Cube lies in its seemingly simplistic storytelling: these people don't know how they got there, why they are there, who put them there, or what the whole thing means, but with no food or water, they decide they better find a way out, and fast.  The setting provides a tense, clausterphobic nightmare, with the strange, darkly lit walls of the cubes covered in odd, almost alien figures and writing, as if they were some kind of extra-terrestrial hieroglyphics.  The simplicity of the entire production design makes it a wholly believable, stomach-churning realistic situation. They're aided by a fantastic script that truly makes the most of the paranoid characters and overwhelming setting.The cast of relative uknowns does an excellent job of conveying the paranoia and fear apparent in being stuck in an experiment that is a both sickly logical and illogical.  While the script is busy unraveling the mystery of the maze they're in, it doesn't neglect to show us why these people should survive.  The characters, much like the maze itself, are multi-faceted and filled with traps of their own.  If seeing them attempt to survive the demonic cube maze isn't enough to invoke suspense, the film douses itself with characters who are as rigid and filled with hidden danger, giving the audience a double dose of terror.In a film that takes place entirely in the same surroundings, it's amazing how effective Cube is in building a mountain of suspense in what appears to be a very constricting area.  The film could have turned into monotony: two hours of it shot in the same scene.  Director Natali uses this to his advantage, however, and delivers a truly terrifying, gripping, almost suffocating  film dripping with enough tension to fill more than a few vapid horror and sci-fi films.  With an effective cast, a script with brains and originality to spare, Cube is easily one of the most inventive and utterly frightening sci-fi films ever.9 out of 10",Cube

Although perhaps I'm underestimating this film: maybe the idea that the people spend all this time and effort to end up in the cube they started in (and, indeed,should simply have stayed there all along) is an analogy for the audience having just wasted the last 90 odd minutes and, indeed, should have not bothered with the trip at all.

179,RunningFromSatan,"Awesome sci-fi movie, which ACTUALLY makes you think about society today",8,28 August 2001,"Once again, a friend, who has the uncanny ability to pick out good obscure movies, explained ""Cube"" to me...once he got done, I was so intrigued, I immediately went out to the movie store and rented it.I would like to call this movie the ""Blair Witch"" of sci-fi.  Made on a wafer-thin budget for this type of movie ($365K Canadian -- approx. $240K US), it manages to tell a good story with unknown actors, and a single cubical set (which I read was one 14'x14' set only made to look like different cubes by changing the colors of the tiles), it is simply amazing. But the real concept behind the story is two-fold.  I read a review on another movie site that explained the characters perfectly.  The characters represent our society and the cube represents ""system"", and these characters have one of these qualities: the leader-turn-domineering controller (Quentin); the insider who knows about, but refuses to give up any information about the system (Worth); the paranoid who gets into other peoples' business for their own satisfaction (Holloway); the pushover scholar who easily follows others orders (Leaven); the careless, represented by a mentally challenged character, who knows nothing but could give a crap about the system and never will (Kazan); and the fugitive who wants nothing and will think of nothing but escaping the system with no one's help (the uncredited guy at the beginning, and also Rennes).  I think that this explanation says that each group has an ability, but a disability that inevitably counteracts with their ability and makes it that much harder to beat the ""system"", the cube.The other concept that this movie toys with is math.  Since my favorite subject in school is math, I was interested in how it was incorporated into the movie.  With the help of Leaven, mathematics becomes a vital part of the escape.  I understood some, but others was too complicated (Cartesian coordinates, powers of primes???), but it made it that much interesting, as well.After I saw the movie, I heard that a follow-up to this movie was being made as we speak -- Cube 2: Hypercube.  It won't be a sequel, yet it will deal with the concept of hypercubes which only exist in the 4th dimension, which is a real theory.  That will definitely be a mindboggler...can't wait! Otherwise, as we wait, this movie needs to be publicized, instead of the 90% of the high-budget, starring-famous-actors-who-can-act movies being made today.  9.5/10",Cube

It's better when it appears that there is no life outside of it.   Even the behaviour of the characters, although annoying at some times, are correct. They couldn't totally co-operate except for playing doing what they thought would benefit the group and kept bickering instead of working out the ideals.

Was it a psycho scientist, a govt conspiracy or aliens. Rather it focuses on how the tones of the characters change with time and their purpose. They think of passing only one thing i.e in front of them, which acts as a metaphor for human nature. Also, this movie seema anti capitalist and nihilistic, but manages to show it's perspective.Now the thing is that it isn't perfect. There are flaws too. Such as Leven often messes up with maths, ending up calling composite numbers prime (like, seriously they should've hired a math teacher or something). Also, it has various mathematical errors, which ruina the atmosphere. Second thing is that the characters felt too cringy and unpredictable and.

183,Blackace,Intensely Suspenseful Thriller. Hitchcock Would Be Proud.,8,28 September 2002,"Where do I start trying to explain one of the most original films I've ever scene. It's always a pleasure to view a low-budget film that excels in different areas and becomes a cult following. Cube not only touches your psyche, but also keeps you on the edge and makes you ask many questions along the way and even after the film is over. The movie simply throws you into the plot with no explanation as to how the people got into this giant cube or why. Even the characters don't truly know why they are there or who put them there. Most of them simply know that they were doing something prior to waking up in this cube. That along is a scary thought. All they know is that there is danger in some of the adjacent rooms that can instantly kill them. Some of them have already seen the traps and survived. As the small society discusses their options and there reasons for being there, they soon discover that each person holds a knowledgeable key for escaping. With no food or water, time isn't on their side and only a strong body, mind and the will to live will keep them moving toward their goal of escaping. To tell you much more about the film would totally ruin the surprises and there are many surprises along the way. Some of them are shocking, while others are questionable. The ending is a bit of a shocker and many viewers will be scratching their heads and staring at the screen in awe. This film definitely deserves a sequel and one was actually made called Hypercube. From the reviews I've read, it's basically the same as the first film with different characters and a few twists. None of the questions are answered from the first film, so maybe there will be a 3rd sequel in the near future that will explain EVERYTHING. That would be nice. Listen to what the other reviewers have said about this film and then go out and rent it. You have to see this film at least once. It's totally original and the script was very well written. The actors actually do a decent job even though most of them don't show much depth or chemistry.
Overall the movie is a suspenseful thrill ride that's worth viewing. You'll never know what's going to happen next. There are times when the film drags alone with not much happening, but confrontations seem to be around every corner. Let's hope a 3rd film is made that will clear up questions about the CUBE and all it's mysteries.",Cube

The strength of Cube lies in its inexorable grind towards an inevitable human conclusion.  I found myself immediately hooked, then intrigued, then finally engrossed by the claustrophobic and oppressive journey through the Cube, a journey both in time and space and in the stripping bare (figuratively and semi-literally) of the protagonists.

If they ask questions - slap them.  The people stuck in this situation don't have any answers, and you're supposed to be as clueless as they are.

It's one of VERY few videos worth paying full price for. (I'm stopping soon).  What's more, it's one that you will understand on different levels in subsequent viewings, and despite the minimalism (of everything in the film!) you'll see little extras every time you watch.Can't wait to see what they do with Cube 2: Hypercube (but I am very glad it's not a prequel or sequel, rather 'another go from a different direction').",Cube

The much-maligned ending was the best part, I thought. The entire meaning of the movie was in that last three or so minutes, and the music is incredibly creepy. What's remarkable about this movie is the feelings it provokes. I was terrified. It indulges in a fair amount of gore and violence, but that's not what was scary. It's nihilism was what had been hiding under my covers, and *I'm* very understanding of the nihilistic viewpoint, even if I don't necessarily consider myself to be one.""Cube"" has its flaws, but lack of atmosphere and the ability to provoke aren't among them. I had chills for days after I saw it. (Incidentally, the math does hypothetically work. The guys who made it went to their math professor, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics, and asked him to come up with a number system that would do all the things they needed it to do for the movie. He came up with a system that did all that for a ""cube"" that would be 25 X 25 rooms, but said that with the effort needed to progressively figure out if it would work for a cube the size of the one in the movie, he would be able to get another Ph.D. in math.)",Cube

Unfortunately I am one of those viewers who can only register their negative response, but first a little encouragement. As an experiment its laudable enough, the low budget is obvious but doesn't detract, the players do their best with a talky script but that's as far as it goes. As a horror movie, it doesn't work because it didn't scare me.
The philosophical issues Cube presumes to address can be found in any quality 20th century book, from the writings of Dostoyevsky, to Franz Kafka, to Albert Camus in regards to the meaning of life or it's lack thereof. In which case frankly, I can see little point in watching this movie.
I found similarities to The Poseidon Adventure, Cabin in the Woods and Einstein's theories which sounds pretty interesting on paper, when actually the results on film are definitely not that.

I used to skip math class. I took the bare minimum requirement expected of me and passed with something less than flying colours. The point is, math is all that separates our ""heroes"" from certain death in this arena.""Cube"" is an innovative little thriller that can safely dodge accusations of blandness or mediocrity. The premise is simple and the plight of the characters is highly relative despite its surrealistic science fiction setting. Six individuals find themselves trapped in a cube comprised of many rooms linked together, with no readily visible way out, no rations, tools or explanation for being there, with traps set up in some of the rooms. An apparent experiment on how people think and react to certain situations and the transformations they might undergo.The simplicity of the film and the cube itself are the film's strongest assets and can probably account for it's international success, notably in Japan. It's low budget production costs came under $400,000. But they got a really good bang for their buck with some help from special effects houses that provided their services free of charge. As the director has commented on the audio commentary track of the DVD, one aspect they were going for was a way to have an action flick in one room. They pulled it off quite nicely. Another interesting tidbit brought to light was that each character's name is after a prison.A curious aspect of this Canadian film was its surprisingly short run in Canadian cinemas. In speaking with one of the film's producers, Mehra Meh, I learned that despite it's award as ""Best First Feature"" at the Toronto Film Festival of 1997, the film run in Canada came a year later and was just for a few short weeks before it was yanked from theaters and then showcased internationally. When time came for the DVD release, I found another perplexing development. It was only available as an import. A Canadian film only available as an import in Canada? It wasn't until months later that it was released domestically.In any case, the film is available now and worth checking out if you have interest in the psychological thriller fare.

One of the characters has a method of throwing a shoe into the room to see if anything triggers, but once he's fried, the gang realizes they need a new strategy.Thankfully, the doors all contain numbers and with mathematical equations you can navigate your way out. You can calculate which doors are traps and which lead you in the right direction. The whole game and system are mathematically coherent, unlike the contrived ones in the later Cube films.

192,nathanschubach,A concept without a purpose and annoying characters,4,2 April 2013,"I recently revisited the ""Cube"" movie after seeing it once when it came out, and it holds up in some ways, but mostly it had a lot of annoying parts that I had forgotten about. The Cube concept is simple: various people wake up inside the Cube, a 14x14x14 enclosure with various rooms which might lead to a way out. Each room is designed with doors on the walls, a door in the ceiling, and one in the floor. Aside from different colors, the rooms each have a number-marker on them, and they can either contain traps for unsuspecting travelers or are safe-rooms, allowing visitors to pass through them. We get to understand how these people in the film get from room to room by taking a look at their individual characteristics and professions.I love the concept of the Cube. Waking up inside a potential death-trap is frightening and is a concept used in the ""Saw"" series multiple times years later. Some of the traps are easily avoidable, as shown when one character slips out from being ensnared (and one unlucky guy gets taken out by the easiest trap to avoid), and others are extremely nasty (a whole room of giant spikes, anyone?). The Cube looks interesting, and the CG added to some of the scenes is simple but effective in showing the perilous traps in some of the rooms. Film buffs will notice that it's just one room being shot time and time again, but it feels like the characters are traveling throughout this larger place, so the effect worked on me.The characters got very annoying very quickly, and by the halfway point through the movie, I wanted them all to die, except for the student in the film, who was the only one not whining or being a complete jerk to any of the others. The actors were OK, but the believability of some of them were spotty, especially the actor who portrayed Quentin who has some severe mood changes that come out of nowhere and requires a pretty good actor to ebb and flow with these changes in subtle ways instead of ham-fisted deliveries and heartless, murderous changes in mood as he had. By the end, you feel somewhat happy for those who made it, but mostly, I was disappointed.The music was sparse, and the one main song that played during lulls in the story was a simple, ""Friday the 13th""-ripoff, horror song using echoing voices, a screeching sample, and a few synth plunks making for an abstract and forgettable song. The sound effects, however, were very satisfying and were required to show the heaviness of the doors and the sharp, dangerous quality of the traps.After viewing this, the logic behind the story doesn't work for me. There are supposed to be 17,576 rooms in this Cube, so how did they all just happen to meet each other after the first day being there? I hated that everyone in the party blindly followed the math student from room to room like she knew what she was doing after seeing numbers on the doors for about 2 minutes. She basically quoted something out of a calculus book to confuse the audience into saying ""Sure, fine, whatever. Follow her."" Oh, and NOTHING IS ANSWERED by the end. Where is the Cube? Who or what is it made by? Why are these people selected to be here? If it were made by blind-architects who didn't care about humans being harmed in various rooms, are they the creators of it with only one guy creating the shell that wasn't related to the rest of the architect- crew?It's a confusing watch for those who care about the story. If you watch it for sci-fi elements alone and the concept of the Cube, you'll get into it on suspense and design alone, but otherwise, there are a lot of unanswered questions that leave you wanting to understand more. Maybe answer why these individuals were selected, much like the victims in ""Saw"" are selected. I probably won't get around to watching this again anytime soon. Disappointed.",Cube

It turned out to be a gripping suspense all the way through. The movie was written based on a clever concept that mixes psychology, math and socio-politics criticism. Furthermore, the Cube was filmed as a multi-layered narration. On one level it tells the story of six people imprisoned within a labyrinth of compartments in the shape of cubes. Each compartment had been designed and assembled according to mathematical formula based on a 3-D cube. All six 'prisoners' have to work together using each of his/her skills/knowledge in order to find the exit, before they die trapped within. It is interesting to see how each person contribute their 'knowledge' to decipher the planted 'map' and trying to survive some booby-trapped compartments and threats from themselves. Just like stated by one of the 'prisoners', Rennes:""You've gotta  save yourselves from yourselves"". That line itself is a direct message of the second level of the movie: social criticism. I felt that the movie's pacing and characters' dialogues truly built up the tension, as the audience and the characters are progressively swallowed by a claustrophobic sense. But the real kick of the movie is the message of the story. Basically what the writers are saying is that, so long as the people of our 'modern' society is segregated into myriad 'professional working fields' (for example) and each section doesn't want to know how they are connected or need each other, we all will always live like prisoners inside the 'system'. A system that is getting out of control, as each individual is too busy with his/her own life. That kind of ignorance will eventually breaks down all social orders and kill the people who the system suppose to protect, as it did in the movie. The 'system' has become the prison, represented as the cube inside the movie.The acting may seem rather flat and the characters are eventually two dimensional, since 90 minutes is not a lot of time to build a strong background for each character or the nature of the cube itself. But you can still enjoy the suspense, good interaction, disturbing settings and ponder upon the message.",Cube

This, for some reason, sounds strangely familiar...Wait, I'm writing a review on the movie that takes this concept to another 3-dimensional shape, ""Cube,"" and also manages to make it more like a guessing game as to what will happen next.Six people (doctor, student, cop, escape artist, normal person, autistic person) find themselves in a maze of cubes, with no idea of why they have been imprisoned there or how to get out. They explore the cubes to get out.All these movies made with big budgets and no script are being noticed these days? (Especially 2001, where we got so few good movies that I get a headache thinking about them.) Movies like this, ""Arlington Road,"" ""Finding Forrester,"" and ""2001: A Space Oddysey"" get little attention? (True, ""Arlington Road"" and ""Finding Forrester"" had big budgets, and ""2001"" is almost outdated, but ""AR"" and ""FF"" have scripts, and ""2001"" is still good and confusing.) No wonder. People are too obsessed with huge action movies with no idea of where to stop and not smart enough to ""get"" movies like these (that's the point).I saw this ""butchered"" on Sci-Fi channel, and it was still a smart, daring movie--how else do you explain things like the opening victim of a trap?

These words all made ""Cube"" sound like it was going to bust open the roof with its fresh approach to tension and science fiction. It did not. The film proved incredibly boring and only showcased how dated it is. Perhaps watching it closer to the original release date might have influenced ones opinion on how unique this story is. But time would not be on ""Cubes"" side and this low budget indie wonder would not really cross over into the Cult realm as I don't think it will garner new fans. And a cult classic needs longevity or else its more of a generational film. I'd recommend other films in its place but coming on to 20 years from the films initial release there's too many films that are more awesome, brilliant, riveting and cleverer than this slow drab of a film.

Aspects of this film are similar to episodes of the Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits. Ultimately this is more about people loosing their humanity under extreme pressure than about the futuristic and Kafkaesque trap itself. The opening sequence is truly horrific. The cube itself is well realised and one really wants to know what's outside, where the cube physically is located (it must be vast in size) and who built it and why.

The movie made me wonder if everything really wasn't like a big Tetris game.  Maybe things being round and organic is just an illusion, or the way we prefer to look at them.

203,Stephen-12,Underrated,8,28 September 1998,"'Cube' seems to have gone down better in the UK than at home, judging by the critics.I was impressed enough to see it twice, at consecutive screenings. It's an intelligent film - the concept isn't novel but the setting is (and let's put in a word for the terrific design of the cubes). Sure, the characters may be stereotypes but their interactions are not so predictable (you don't expect the leader to lose control and turn nasty, for example). Similarly, the dialogue sometimes leaves a lot to be desired (too much ""oh my God!' and ""of course!"") - but how would you talk in the same situation?As to the ""why?"" of it all, I don't see it as a cop-out, as some reviewers have suggested. The fact is, there IS no ""why"", as Worth patiently explains. There IS no conspiracy, there IS no brain behind it - it's a big corporate mistake. Only those desperate for another X-Files Big Conspiracy Theory should be disappointed by this explanation.As for the characterisation, the film suffers (as does 'Seven') from not having enough time to develop its characters properly. But to do so would have generated even more talk, and would probably have got boring. Besides, nobody complained that we didn't really know who Mr Blond was in 'Reservoir Dogs'.'Cube' resembles 'Event Horizon' in its situation and the horror of its exposition - but where 'Event Horizon' just gave us a series of iconic figures to be dispatched in a 'Who's next?"" exercise, 'Cube' bothers to give us more. I found myself caring about the characters, I responded positively to the structural approach, I admired the production design and I was regularly surprised. You can't ask for much more from a first feature, and I look forward to seeing Natali's future work.",Cube

The dude who plays the cop was particularly horrible. The acting this guy does in this movie is so awful it's just about beyond human comprehension. Accurately expressing how bad he is is out of the question, he's surpassed that very last category of badness reserved for describing only the most atrocious things, and has passed into a realm that is as of now undefined.With all that said, this is still a very fun movie to watch, and I still recommend it. The acting may not be great, but it's not annoyingly bad like in some other movies, it's kind of humorous here. It's still fun watching these people go from room to room, trying to beat the next trap that the room can throw at them.The single distraction I had in this movie was that doctor lady, and that's saying something if she distracted me more than the cop's acting.

The characters may be constrained by a weak script, but the passion and emotion is all from the Rambo school of films rather than the more appropriate Silence of the Lambs school. The second problem is the ending. I have a horrible feeling that it is all meant to be religious in its significance (help!) but it is so wet and so opaque that I really felt annoyed at the dozen of so guesses I had made at the Cube's significance during the film.

However I finally caught this one on a late Friday Night playing on IFC.  I was astonished.  The tense nature of this film is quite unparalleled to films of recent memory.  The nemesis is unknown and the purpose of it is unknown.  This may turn off a few viewers but this film basically says, ok they don't know what the Cube is, they don't know why it is, and neither should you.  It is strange how Hollywood feels we need to know Who?, What?, Where?, and Why?, in every film.   What is the point? There are alot of everyday situations that go on in normal life that do not answer that question.  That is why I applaud this metaphorical middle finger at Hollywood filming.

It's an interesting character study to see how 6 strangers trapped in a maze with very little time to escape and even less knowledge of even how escaping would be possible.

215,Rick-34,pretentious pseudo-intellectual existentialism,6,28 July 2000,"The worst thing about this movie was that I had a good idea of exactly where it was going after the first five minutes. OK, the premise is not terrible, but nor is it very original. You've got a bunch of people trapped in some kind of three-dimensional mazea - they don't know why they are there or whether they can get out.  Shades of the legendary ""Prisoner"" TV program, or ""No Exit"" by Sartre.  Typical existentialist themes: why are we here, what can we do, how do we solve our problems, is there any reason to have hope?The themes are reasonable, but the execution is terrible.  What one expects is a thematic pursuit about what people want to live for, some psychological exploration, etc.  What we get is inconsistent character development and insulting plot twists.My main problem with this movie is that the Worth and Quentin characters are very inconsistently drawn.  In the first half of the movie, the Quentin character provides leadership qualities, getting people motivated and moving, keeping up hope, while the Worth character is moody and generally acts like a coward and an ass. Suddenly, in the middle of the movie, each undergoes a magical transformation.  Worth is now the moral force behind the group, while Quentin becomes violent and rageful, ultimately reaching a state where he is a typical movie bad guy.  His psychosis appears suddenly without rhyme or reason.  Any hope I had for this movie went out the window when it appeared.  The movie was no longer even a half-decent treatment of existentialist themes, but rather had degenerated into ""watch out for the bad guy"" stuff.  Very disappointing.One minor quibble: the Leaven character is somehow easily able to tell if a three-digit number is prime or not, but then is paralyzed if she has to decide whether a number is a prime power.  As a professional mathematician, I have to say this plot twist is laughable.  Factoring three-digit numbers is a simple trick for a mathematician of Leaven's supposed caliber. The number of prime powers less than 1000 which are not themselves prime is really quite small.  One doesn't need a Rainman-type savant to solve this problem.  (Had they been factoring the full 9-digit numbers, well, that would have been much more impressive.)

217,Teebs2,A Good B-Movie,7,26 June 2004,"*SOME SPOILERS THROUGHOUT*The Cube was one of those films I'd heard a few good things about but I never actively searched it out. I recently spotted it at the local video store so I decided to give it a go. The first thing it is important to consider is that this was only a notch up from a student film, as it was Natali's debut feature after film school and had a budget of only $300,000. With that in mind, the film is quite remarkable.In many ways this is about as ""high concept"" as you can get - 6 strangers from different walks of life find themselves trapped in a giant maze of rooms contained within a giant cube, furthermore they discover some rooms are lethally trapped. Why or how they got there is never disclosed, which adds to the mystery. I first want to pick out the films merits. First, it is a great idea that because of it's dependance on character should appeal to a wide audience, not just sci-fi fans. The set design is excellent for such a low budget and the CGI work (apparently donated by CORE design in Canada for nothing) is also good for a film of this budget. The cinematography, though a little murky, is great at emphasising the claustrophobia through wide angle lenses and exaggerated camera positions. For a film mostly shot hand-held, many of the shots are extremely steady and smooth. The sound design is good as well with plenty of atmospheric rumbling as well as high-tech mechanical sounds for the traps.Where the film drops some points, however, is in the script and acting. I personally found only a couple of the characters likeable, and one, Holloway, was so irritating I cheered when she was disposed of. For a film as reliant on script and character as this, any weakness is sure to be particularly noticeable. I thought that both Nicky Guadigni and Maurice De Wint over-acted when some subtlety was required. The dialogue was also very patchy at times. (""You beautiful brain!"") Having said that Nicole De Boer as Leaven (very convincingly playing a high school student in her mid-twenties) and David Hewlett as the cynic, Worth, were mostly excellent and Andrew Miller does a good Rain Man impression.Although a film of this nature requires some suspension of disbelief, I thought that it was pushing it too far that Leaven just happened to be a high school student able to do PHD level maths. I also thought it was a bit messy to suddenly make Kazan, the autistic, also turn out to be a mathematical genius. If this was his 'gift' he should have been the one doing the maths throughout.I mentioned before that this should appeal to  a wider audience than just sci-fi/thriller fans. This is because being very reliant on character there are also some larger themes involving the nature of humanity and society. This film has intelligence and does open up some great philosophical points for debate.And the ending - You'll either love it or hate it depending on your outlook on life. Being a bit of a cynic I liked it. Although the final survivor seems to be quite arbitrary and there doesn't seem to be a clear message or final statement (unless it is that the mentally handicapped will inherit the earth!) the ending stays with the themes and tone of the film as a whole.To conclude - Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the film as a whole and it was an original concept largely well executed which is always refreshing to see. However the few weaknesses I have mentioned do detract which is quite disappointing. Now the director has seen some  higher budget success with ""Cypher"", maybe a remake with a better cast and a sharper script would reach the level of greatness this is tantalisingly close to.Verdict: 7",Cube
218,giomanombre,I'm a cult fan of this movie - it's really wins heads up....,10,21 October 2007,"Acting performances and character interaction is what made this movie really unique. I'm still reviewing it over seeing some particular sequences. For example, the part where Quinton says 'Woman, I'm tired mopping up after your bleeding heart...."" and then they both start berating each other in a slew of personal attacks is just hilarious, I was almost wondering if this was a comic relief element to the movie. And the 'system' aspect to it when Worth is describing what the function of the cube is, like a some sort of massive project without a purpose that you need people to be stuck into it, is also something that I really enjoy reviewing over and over again. I like the dialog and scripts it's what really sets the whole tone. I liked Hollowways's character.

The general plot is not innovative in any way, but it is a least more creative than most horror/ sci-fi films these days.  Though the film itself suffers from one serious problem:  Repetition.  It's people walking through a series of booby trapped cubes.  It's cool at first, but after a while it begins to get tiresome. The writers probably figured you wouldn't notice because the film is supposed to be a character study of people placed under pressure, but that aspect of the screenplay is terribly cliche.  All the characters are generic and possess no real traits we can latch onto as an audience.  The screenplay is not necessarily bad, it's just not good.  It fits nicely in the average category.  The acting wasn't that bad.  I don't know what you people want, but I can think of tons of actors who could've done worse in the movie. They are a bunch of unknowns, sure, but that doesn't mean they are bad actors. It's not oscar material, but it's far from bad.    I like and am annoyed by the lack of closure in the film.  On one hand, it lets you the viewer develop your own decision about the meaning of the cubes, but it also demonstrates an element of languor on the part of the writers.It's a nice idea that burns itself out too quickly.  The screenplay is average, and the acting likewise.  It has some nice cinematography, and it entertaining enough to keep you awake.

221,illegal_alien51,Really good!,8,3 May 2004,"I wouldn't say that this movie is top notch, but it is definitely way above average! What struck me more than the cube(s) or traps or anything else was that this movie basically was truly naturalistic. In naturalism you put a group of different people into a confined space and see what happens. I got that feeling from this movie. As the walls closed in on the people's minds some got more and more paranoid, it showed more and more if they were of good or bad character. And that is basically what you do in a naturalistic story - you study how people behave and how they change from every day behaviour to stress behaviour. I liked that quite a lot, there are not many movies out there which do that quite as purely or convincingly and Cube succeeded with that hard task, mainly because it didn't promise too much!
The setting itself was quite unique and the idea intriguing and really interesting!The only things that made me smile a bit were the door handles.

In the process they are picked off one by one with gruesome death traps. That's the torture-porn part.From such pedestrian beginnings however comes what is, at times, a surprisingly engrossing film. You find yourself caught up in the same questions facing the characters: why are they here? what is this place? why did someone spend a whole lot of money building something with essentially no purpose other then to confuse people and kill them horrifically?Alas, the main characters never learn the answers to any of these questions and neither do we. We just get to watch them struggle and die in ways that are sometimes believable, sometimes not, and always over- the-top. The film-making craft here is excellent and the director manages to make you believe an entire environment with just a single set that consists of 3 walls, some make-up and models, and a bit of CG. Visually, the movie is stunning in its elegant simplicity and that's its strongest point. Unfortunately, the death scenes, while dramatic, often strain believability. A good example is the first one, where someone is ""diced"" by what we can presume is a mono-filament wire grid. People, however,are not bricks of cheese that fall apart in cubes. We are much more akin to a tomato or a water balloon and the effect used thus, while visually appealing, makes no sense at all.But, in general, sense is not this movie's strong point. Film- making,and to a lesser extent , acting, are. And there it shines as a brilliant example of doing film on a tight budget.",Cube
228,Dante Hicks,Unusual,8,3 May 2000,"Great idea for a film. Put a group of disparate people in what is essentially a puzzle box and watch as they valiantly battle fiendish traps and complex mathematical problems. As none of them remember why or how they woke up in the 'Cube' intrigue and mistrust follow them around and build up to a series of confrontations in which secrets and revealed and violent madness breaks out. This film kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole 90 minutes as the prisoners used their talents and discovered more and more what was happening to them. Also, with several being minced in quite hideous ways there was a question of 'who next?'. Not quite genius but close, though not for the squeamish.",Cube

232,delibebek,A surprising study,7,18 August 2010,"The story in this movie seems simple, but it's the kind of story that could go in any direction. Several people find themselves in a series of room, many of which are booby trapped. This fact is presented to us before any of the characters themselves, so there's no surprise to us that they face danger at every turn. The suspense of this, and the fact that there are no Hollywood stars around keeps the viewer not knowing who may die and how.Beyond this simple fact, there are the relationships that develop between and among characters. While a truly thoughtful writer could have carried this aspect in other directions, the story here keeps those moments restrained. The script is very effective in moving things along, with a few contrived leaps in logic, but it's all in the characters, and it just so happens that they're right. Imagining myself in the same situation, I can't believe that I would automatically assume myself to be inside a giant cube formation, but in this film, and each of the following ones, that assumption is made by the characters without enough clues to work with.The mixture of personality types is intriguing and turns out to be key to the movie. Each character is presented well enough, although none of the acting stands out. Then, this movie isn't about acting, it's truly all about the suspense of moving from one room to another, and trying to outthink the characters as they reach their conclusions about the purpose of the whole thing.",Cube

Then those.... oh i think you get it. We are in the midst of a cult classic people!What else can i say?

234,rj-27,interesting allegory?,8,26 July 1999,"While some movies fairly beg to be picked apart frame by frame for cinematic, directorial and script-writing qualities, I tend to view movies such as this as not intended to be merely entertaining (because this one is fairly painful to watch at most times), but for allegorical purposes.  We do not like to think of our lives as having no meaning and without purpose, and that is exactly what the character Worth (intentional, for sure) thinks of his own life and has no real desire to escape the Cube.  As it turns out, he who at first appears to be the least worthwhile character, turns out to have the most when it counts. While the ending leaves more questions unanswered than answered, it does not diminish the power of the statement that even when it seems as though life has no purpose, it surely does when you look without, not within, for its answers.",Cube

236,plaidpotato,Like something a moderately clever teenager might write.,4,2 February 2003,"The best sequence in Cube involved the room with the noise-activated trap. To avoid being diced up by razor wire, the characters had to shut their mouths for a few minutes.  It was a nice reprieve from the spew of shrill babble that fills the rest of the film.  There was a dim little glimmer of an interesting idea here, but almost every aspect of Cube was poorly executed.  The screenplay was atrocious--smarmy, sarcastic, charmless, nonsensical.  A typical episode of Gilligan's Island has much more to offer.  4/10",Cube

The premise was of interest, but the first half an hour of elementary-level acting skills turned me off. I began to overlook the bad acting soon enough as the storyline and set design drew me in. This is a great example of a movie that's replete with substance and doesn't suffer much if at all from the skills of the actors and actresses involved.

Here is the world as Kafka saw it: a bewildering and frightening series of seemingly random events, bureaucracy and lack of progression for the individual within it.

239,doveed,Good Concept/Weak Execution,5,3 November 2018,"This is actually a really cool concept - a group of people are trapped inside a giant cube. They go from room to room, each room shaped like a cube, trying to find a way out. A cube is a six dimensional figure, but unfortunately, the dialogue and the acting is only one dimensional. The first few minutes were pretty well shot, but it seemed the director became a little restless in this confined space and tried to compensate with unmotivated cinematography. The production design and art direction were good, but the direction throughout was very contrived. What this film lacked maturity. Too many aspects of this project were juvenile and annoying. In a nutshell, the concept totally outclassed the execution, and it was this good concept that prevented me from giving it a 4 out of 10.",Cube
240,Bifrostedflake,Claustrophobic and intense sci-fi thriller.,9,19 January 2006,"This movie is an excellent example of low-budget horror at it's best.The movie deals with several themes, people, situation, fear, stress amongst other things.The actors performances are truly fantastic as well as the concept for the film being a bit mind blowing. It does has a lot of technical things inside the plot which may make your brain hurt but it's a film well worth taking the time to see.Six (well seven really) people wake up inside a fourteen foot by fourteen foot cube shaped room with no idea of how they got there or why they are there. Travelling through the rooms they encounter much more than they bargain for with 'traps' laying in wait for them.They must figure out a way to escape the cube before they die. The real question is, is the danger the cube or the people themselves?",Cube
241,MovieManiacX,A Great Movie That Gets Everything Right,9,16 March 2005,"I throughly enjoyed Cube. It made me think, it made me cringe, and it creeped me out. What would I do if I woke up in a maze of deadly traps? How would I cope with it? Could I make it out? All of these questions were going through my mind as I watched this excellent flick.The mood is very grim and uneasy. The colors of the rooms and the eerie noises of those doors opening and closing make it even more unsettling. Other than the characters talking, the only other noise is the slight humming of the rooms themselves. Watching it in complete darkness on a home theater system completely immersed me in the film.The gore is fantastic, especially the scene in the beginning. It's nice to see a recent movie with the guts to show some blood and guts! (no pun intended...well, maybe a little) Even though there are only two good gore scenes, they are two really good scenes. The special effects are decent for 1997, nothing groundbreaking. And none of the gore is computer generated, which makes it even better.The acting is good by everyone. The one who really stood out was Rennes, the convict. I really liked him. His ""take no crap"" attitude was perfect and is exactly the mentality you'd need to get through this. Quentin went a little over-the-top, but I thought he was good. Everyone else did a fine job.The Bottom Line: A excellent, makes-you-think flick, with some good characters, great ideas and a couple of great gore scenes!",Cube
242,raidatlanta,They wanted to make a film about social interaction?,3,21 October 2017,"Note that all though I gave this film 3 stars, I would still recommend it for a b-movie night with friends and popcorn where you just laugh about how weird and absurd Cube is.Don't watch it if you are expecting to see something good, to which you would devote your whole attention though. The story, though absurd, is quite simple, and perhaps a bit empty at times - montages of the actors' faces and of cubes fill in sequences in between dialogue. The actors were terrible, and that is one thing that made this film go down. the characters were a bit caricatured. perhaps some more effort could have been made in script writing / dialogues to make it less of a yell match, and more of some sort of performance.. then again, it might just come from the actors.In the beginning I was relatively enthusiastic, but the whole of the interaction in it takes a wannabe philosophical twist where you aren't really sure what they want to say - though whatever they want to say didn't seem that interesting or relevant anyways. it seemed like they just wanted to sent in the kind of thoughts one can have when paranoiac, perhaps. In any case ; absurd and entertaining, but somewhat dull, repetitive and not that well played.",Cube

So if when watching the movie, 5-10 minuities in you get the distinct feeling that there is not going to be a resolution, nothing will be explained or make any sense and that the character development, which isn't great but its still irrelevant and a waste of time.
The movie attempts to be a trendy flick exploring the depths of human nature. It fails abysmally. Any suspense the plot might generate is also a waste and it's purely suspense for it's own sake. It's a kind of prequel to the maze runner movies, except this is worse in every way.",Cube
245,Evil_Magus,An Unexpected Gem.,9,24 July 2006,"I've heard for some time how great this movie was, and have meant for some time to watch it. But after I watched Cube Zero the other night, I decided that I HAD to see it, and that the time was now. I expected a decent movie: something atmospheric and intelligent, but largely nothing I hadn't seen before. What I got, instead, was an unexpected cinematic gem, far better than most other movies.The acting was great, not excellent by any means, but still of a very high caliber. The two most memorable deserve special mentioning.Nicole de Boer (Jone Leaven: The Math Student) did an outstanding job. She had a solid and believable performance throughout the entire film. She was very steady, and even made actions as mundane as her thinking for extended periods of time enjoyable.Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin: The Cop) gave a thoroughly enjoyable performance as a man who sinks deeper and deeper into depraved madness. in most cases, actors given this kind of role will make their characters descend into madness far too quickly. While he might have overacted a little from time to time, he gave a extremely well-paced performance and believably portrayed his characters increasing insanity.Personally, I found these actors/actresses all far above average and more than competent in their roles. I'm actually surprised that they haven't gone on to at least be recognizable mid-name actors. A special mention should be given to whoever did the casting. They did an absolutely perfect job at choosing the roles.The direction was simple, yet effective. It used a style that reminded me very much of Alfred Hitchcock: minimalist, but maximizing every aspect of the film. Vincenzo Natali created a powerful and thick environment; tense and atmospheric. Even moreso than the crew, I would have expected him to have become a much greater success than he is now.Natali also wrote the script which, like his direction, is simple and effective. 7 people wake up in a labyrinth of trapped cubes and must find their way out. The cast is small, the premise simple, and the dangers evident. And yet these are all its greatest strengths. With a small cast, every danger, every death, means much more than if there was a larger cast. Also, with a smaller cast there's much more time to develop each character, which the script maximizes upon. The simplicity of the script, the almost bare danger, makes it all the more terrifying. You know the rules, you know what's going to happen, and you know that there's no way to avoid it.The emptiness of the cube, the isolation from anything and everything else, is felt in every passing minute. The utter pointlessness of it all is as thoroughly maddening to the audience as it is to the characters. This, however, gives every action more meaning, and adds to the film's overall tone. The dark colors of the various rooms add to heavy and dismal atmosphere. The emptiness beyond the cube creates a further sense of isolation. And the powerful message at the end of the film (which I won't spoil for anybody), the bitter-sweet irony of it all, is what makes this such an excellent film.Overall, this is a classic sci-fi thriller. It's a definite must-see for science fiction and horror fans, as well as fans of powerful human drama. This is easily one of the most original and successful films I can think of in any of those three categories.",Cube
246,FatPhil,"Has ups and downs. No masterpiece, but no turkey either.",6,9 August 2002,"This has good points and bad points. One good point that it tries to break out of the Hollywood mould, and to sime extend succeeds. One bad point is that all the characters are polar, they all have one role in the film, and they tediously follow their assigned pattern, having no complexity or depth. (Why am I reminded of The Breakfast Club as I write this? That film was better in this regard). There were a few weaknesses in the plot too - suddenly one person lost the ability to do what had previously been trivial, and for no reason al all except to bring another cookie-cutter character into play. I sound negative, but I did enjoy the film, and if you don't mind the occasional gruesome scene, it's worth a look. I hear that it was done on a low budget, in which case kudos to the crew and actors.FatPhil.",Cube

249,kenvandenbussche-2,Canadian Cube of terror,7,23 October 2007,"This low-budget Canadian science-fiction movie is truly one of the most original thrillers I have ever seen. It deals with a couple of people each with their own specific talent imprisoned in a world of deadly rooms. The many boobytraps hidden in each cube are enough to alarm even the bravest person and they soon begin to lose their patience as well as their hope in getting their lives back.The entire movie is basically one huge mission to make it out of the huge cube alive. The fact that each room has a devious trap in store and the wide diversity of the many characters make up for a very enjoyable movie. Every now and then: you are presented with unusual camera shots which adds to the already creepy atmosphere. The movie begins for example with a close-up shot of someone's eye. Near the end: you do happen to have the feeling that you've seen everything and any presentation of a new room actually feels more like a stretch than an interesting plot development. Fortunately: they don't drag the movie on for too long and the ending has an okay twist.Being a low-budget movie in Canada, one might expect that ""Cube"" doesn't have a single famous actor. Not to worry, because all acting is quite good. There are at least two performances that are worth mentioning here. Maurice Dean Wint plays the part of Quentin the cop and he's quite good. The best acting however is by Andrew Miller who plays the role of Kazan the autistic man. Andrew Miller is no Dustin Hoffman so don't expect a Rainman-performance, but his acting is easily the best thing alongside the eerie atmosphere and originality of this beautiful thriller.In short: If you want proof that good movies don't always come from millions of dollars - check this one out! It's as good as any low-budget movie could ever be!",Cube
250,Cacus7,A para-normal thriller of great proportions,10,22 April 2002,"""Cube"" is not a movie for the average viewer.  To understand it fully requires some measure of intelligence, which I believe is a refreshing break from the normal.  While not an expert at mathematics by any means,  I found myself striving to understand the empirical truth behind this movie. Featuring a fantastic cast of relatively unknown actors, this movie far exceeds the viewer's wildest dreams.  It is harrowing, poignant, terrifying, thoughtful, disturbing, thought-provoking, and fascinating as the plot unfolds.  The conclusion begs for clarification, as I hope the sequel to ""Cube"" will provide.  I happened to see ""Cube"" almost accidentally, as I simply was seeking to view something not showing at the majority of theaters in my town.  I am very grateful that I was able to screen this fantastic film, and am anxious to show my DVD copy of it to anyone who is willing. ""Cube"" is the epitome of independent film-making, and proves that small projects still have the ability to eclipse the big-name studio productions. WATCH THIS MOVIE!",Cube

But after leaving the room several times due to a) acting that wouldn't look amiss in an Ikea catalogue and b) special effects that wouldn't look amiss on an episode of Ren & Stimpy, I was merely appalled by every other aspect of the film.  The laughable mathematical knowledge of the ""hero"" was stupid, all the other characters didn't even go through the sane/insane stage, they just went mad from the off.  I can't spoil the ending, but that sucks as well.  Maybe I'm missing something.

It is however a very very bad movie for people who expect an omniscient POV of the goings-ons in a film.

(one of the characters turns out to be a bit insane and kills everyone, except for an autistic guy who ends up the only one to get out alive.)The idea is good, and the scene in the sound activated room is nerve-wracking. The answers to the rooms are a bit complex, but the movie also has one problem - the story can't hold out for one and a half hours.

258,slawman,What was that about the ending?,9,7 November 1999,"I will take the high road here and not mention by name the reviewer who wrote that the (I'm quoting directly) ""retard squealing"" made him not enjoy the film.  But I would like to take issue with those who feel the ending is a letdown.I recently had a debate with a friend who felt that ""The Blair Witch Project"" was a disappointment only because of the ending.  Her position was that the film was utterly pointless because the ending was ambiguous, whereas my point of view has always been that (for horror films anyway) an unexplained ending is often the key to a frightening film.  To me, the ending of ""Cube"" has that sort of feel.  Sure, one character does offer some sort of plausible explanation, but I'm not sure I trust it, and I think the explanation is more to provide the film with an extra layer of metaphoric significance than to explain the origins of the ""cube"".  No, the actual ending is not exactly profound, and I don't believe it has any religious symbolism attached to it.  But doesn't anyone but me find a bit of Rod Serling irony in it?Overall, I was rather surprised at the vitriolic attacks on the movie appearing in this review section.  It is not perfect, but the movie is more original in theme and structure than virtually any science fiction film of the last ten years (""12 Monkeys"" excepted).  And to respond to the reviewers (more than one) who claim that this is not worth watching because ""Lifeboat"" was so much better:  It's a shame we shouldn't watch ""Goodfellas"" because ""The Godfather"" was there first.",Cube

260,Eva Ionesco,"Fascinating idea, even with obvious mistakes",8,8 December 1999,"Cube has a great idea for a movie. What if you were to awaken one day in a cube, a prison of cube like rooms in a huge cube, not knowing how you got there, or why you're there, or who made it, or what it's for? Each of the rooms is connected to another by a small door in each of its six sides. And it's a deadly maze, with some of the rooms booby-trapped! It's such an original idea, it deserves a viewing just for that fact alone!Is the only way out through death? If there is an exit, how do you find it? Needless to say, each of the prisoners combine their skills for survival, and each of them can't survive the booby-traps without the others. For example, the mathematician works out a formula which proves accurate and helps them for a time, but eventually the numbers get so large, no human being could measure them, so they must find another way.Soon, you begin to recognise, from the discussions and from the type of stresses they're undergoing, that the film is an analogy for life on Earth, for they are asking the fundamental questions that all humans ask about life on Earth.Is there a way to escape the dangers? How will we recognise the way out when we find it? Who built this prison and why? Is it more dangerous to search for the answers, or should we just stay where we are? How did we get here and where are we going? Is there a higher meaning to it all?Every room is like another day on this planet, complete with its danger rooms and its safe rooms. And all of us are combining our strengths to survive, and learning valuable lessons along the way.The film is so perfect in this way, that we can afford to ignore the glaringly obvious mistakes, and just enjoy the ride. For instance, the doors *always* make a noise when they open or close. They can't be opened without it. So why is there no noise of an opening door when the killer is sneaking into the room behind someone?Another glaring mistake is in the scripting, where the killer speaks as if he's been there a long time, and has become determined to get out, even though he's only just awoken and is supposed to be confused as to where he is!Such mistakes are completely forgivable, owing to the magnificent effectiveness and originality of the rest of the film. This film thoroughly deserves to be put on your ""must-see"" list!Now, there are two more important things that need to be said, but *don't* read on until *after* you've seen the film, because they *will* spoil your enjoyment of this film, OK?*Here comes the spoiler!*Another way in which the film resembles life on earth is in it's ending. Only the innocent escape from the cycle of suffering, just like all the wise men of history have told us.And one fact makes this film soar above its deficiencies! That whole massive cube full of different cube-shaped rooms? It is an illusion - they used only *ONE* cube-shaped room, throughout the filming! That achievement alone deserves dumbstruck jaw-dropping  admiration! And another trip to the cinema!",Cube

263,motorfocus82,A very mediocre movie that wants to be more.,4,9 December 2013,"I walked in on this while friends were watching it, just a couple of minutes in. Thus, I had no idea whether they were watching it and had never seen it, or had seen it and thought it was good or bad, or if they even realized that it was a B movie. After it was mostly over, I said that it was a bad movie, which got me the kind of looks you get when you accidentally step on a dog's tail and the yelp draws everyone's attention. Don't watch it with libertarians. It IS a bad movie. I've seen worse, but it's bad. The production values, including the acting, are good for $300,000, but the script and its underlying ideas make up its real purpose. It is philosophical in the sense of basically ripping the basics of post-Enlightenment humanism out of the most clichéd characters and faux-sophisticated dialogue possible. The script is the point. And the script is pretty bad. The lead guy, the one who starts off as the ringleader and driver of the action, must eventually turn out to be an insane, violent pederast simply because he's not a whimpering moron with a singular function or a strident bleeding heart; his transformation represents the throwing off of authoritarian shackles by the good and virtuous people following the birth of the age of reason. The perspective makes itself more clear with the explanation for the existence of the cube: it has no purpose, no driver, just an accident of power that traps people. The ending shows the one remaining character stepping into a pure light of nothingness, and that's about the size of it. It's humanitarian nihilism on film. Judging by the ratings and comments on it here, that qualifies as deep psychology to the typical moviegoer.The handful of surprises in the movie revolve around the room design, with its Hollywood Standard methods of killing people like acid and blades, and a strangely convoluted explanation of how a three-axis coordinate system works. The novelty of these parts, along with the bare adequacy of the production values when handicapped for a B grade budget, get the film four out of ten, maybe four and a half. But let's be clear: it's a bad movie. I can actually enjoy a pointless movie, but movies which think they have a point, then fail to make it, are far worse. And for Christ's sake, do NOT watch this with libertarians. Probably not liberals, either. It's one of those films that makes people think that it vindicates their worldview, no matter what that worldview is.",Cube

But simple can also be good sometimes. I think this concept is brilliant and very original. If you're a fan of original sci-fi movies, I really think you'll enjoy this one. It quickly catches your attention, and doesn't let go until it's over.The only setback is the acting. In my opinion the acting is poorly done, or at least mediocre at it's best. Especially the Quentin-character kept annoying me. I didn't really ""believe"" him. This is too bad, because it takes some of the focus away from the plot.Still, I really liked ""Cube"".

269,DeadeGuard98,"A Cube, A Theory and The Numbers.",8,12 June 2020,"😱 First Impressions:
Stuck in the eponymous Cube, a group of people wake up and stumble into deadly traps. This is maybe one of the earliest to do this kind of concept, 1997 and all. A year before I was born~ Had no idea about this film until a few years ago. If it's anything like ""Saw"" (by that I mean the first film hopefully) then it should be worth unraveling!Pros:
😋 The film never gives a solid answer as to who the organization or individual behind the commissioning of such a contraption is. THAT'S the fun part, theorizing whether it's some rich, sicko with time to kill. Maybe the shady government who uses taxpayer dollars for god knows what. Maybe it's a form of rehabilitation device (that's what I thought of myself, they are dressed as prisoners after all). Then there's their being named after famous prisons. Quite a strange but intriguing use of symbolism here...😋 The characters. Everyone for the most part was played extremely well. I don't think they were in any other movies I've ever seen. But I probably just don't recognize them in their PRIME (anyone?!). A-anyways, they come off stilted initially but come on- ever heard of 1st impressions? Then eventually they get to know one another (perhaps even too much) and they reveal their true personalities that they've locked away inside. Quentin and Holloway have their most inner demons explored. With Alderson and Rennes, the least. My personal favorite is Leaven, she's innocent, pretty and intelligent. Look at me voicing out biases!!😋 The crux behind the effectiveness of Cube as a thriller is how it capitalizes on the lack of gore. You'd think being in this cube where lethal traps are ready to rip them apart within seconds would be the popular, silent killer. But nope, it's the trapped human beings themselves. Quentin offs and injures badly pretty much everyone. This was done both physically and psychologically.Before you know it; fright, paranoia and anger sets in, getting the best of the poor souls. It's a very real fear that has always existed but usually kept in check. The stress of trying to figure out whether each room is safe and on top of that being locked in with strangers could make anyone lose it.
Cons:
😪 The Cube has many room *snorts* for theorizing but that ultimately leads nowhere because that's just that. Possibilities. If you think about it- the group had made many mistakes in their attempts at deciphering the numbers in between each rooms before realizing that it was actually sadistically easy... If you apply that logic then the answer could just be very simple too. But I guess we won't know until I watch the sequel/prequel.😪 The characters are bright and useful in their own ways but I just thought there were some obvious parts of the film that should'vd been like ""wait a minute""'. When Leaven says the numbers are coordinates- I thought okay that's cool, damn.... Then I thought shouldn't the numbers be in running order then? BUT the numbers appeared to be randomized. That's when I pieced it all together. Coupled with the noise at irregular intervals. The entire structure is constantly shifting!! I just thought it was obvious by then, but alas the film needed this to set it's pacing and be more dramatic.😪 I know it's a sci-fi and riddle solving movie. But honestly when they kept spouting numbers, it nearly put me well to sleep. Mind you, I've absolutely adore slow, boring movies. Maybe it's just the numbers bit, I admit they do turn me off immensely fast. I am fine with the basics, but once you add in permutations, cartesian... (probably depends on which education system your country adopts but damn I got a headache). Just a partial con. One highly personal to me. XD😇Verdict😈
Cube is obviously an indie film but one that knows exactlt what it is and doesn't overshoot the mark. Being minimalistic in its approach to the premise and set designs. Boasting serviceable characters whose occasionally awkward delivery never takes you out of their predicament. However, its barebones story is very noticeable and there is no solution to that puzzle. That is where the sequel and prequel would come in, I guess.",Cube

271,giuliano-3,Impressive Low Budget Thriller,7,14 August 2000,"Although there are some continuity conflicts and at times over the top acting (although maybe intentionally), this film is an extraordinary accomplishment given what the filmmakers had to work with. The end is also a bit dicey, but then again it leaves much open to discussion which in this case is a good thing. I have talked to a friend who is very involved with the math field, and he is the only person I know who straight up didn't like the film. The point being, if you are capable enough with math to understand geometry, basic algebra, etc., you will be fine - but if you are familiar with stuff like the chaos theory and abstract mathematics you'll be offended. If anyone else with extensive knowledge of mathematics has seen this film I'd be very interested on hearing feedback. All that aside, this film is truly captivating. I was introduced to it by spotting it in a friend of a friend's collection, asked him about it, and he replied ""I can't explain it, I'll just show you the first scene.""

I am all for movies being ambiguous and making you come up with your own asumptions as to what is going on or what happened afterward, but with all the build up and all the agony the film makes you go through to get there, I have to say that I was more than disapointed.  I will never watch that movie again.  If I want to be tortured, like i feel this movie did to me, I would rather watch a 5th grade choir belt out tunes at the top of thier little lungs. When a movie is so promising and just turns to mud, it makes me feel worse than if it had sucked from the beginning.

The ""cop"" inexplicably decides to let go of the hand of the doctor and let her drop to her death.  No explanation, no reason. Solely to set up the irony of the protector being the killer and the shock of watching a character die. The movie still rates a four rating because the set design and the cube concept were interesting and the editing and camera work were excellent.  The acting, script, and plot line were abysmal.

Watching these individuals figure out the cube was fascinating. By the end of the movie, I was fully invested in Worth, Leaven, and Kazan. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because of that crappy ending. Quentin popping back up was NOT for me. I was perfectly content thinking of him growing even more insane and then eventually dying in the cube. Instead, he stabs Leaven in the back and Worth gives up his own chance at freedom to save Kazan and kill Quentin. I would have preferred all three of them had made it out alive.

287,TG22Film,An enthralling experience,8,21 January 2006,"I had only read a hint of what 'Cube' was about when it appeared on the TV schedule, and as I thought it sounded intriguing, I recorded it. The following day, from the moment I began to watch it, I was hooked.Being a sci fan and a student of psychology this film was indeed perfect for me. There were more twists and turns in some of the personalities than the cube itself. This is what gave the film its psychological and thought provoking value.The character that really shocked me was Quentin. Appearing as a headstrong do-gooder cop at the beginning to later become a psychotic killer was for me, unexpected. I was comfortable with Quentin the way he was to start with, before this alter-ego stepped in. Another interesting character change was concerning Worth. His stance to begin with was very negative (being a part of a team involved with the Cube's design), but as Quentin turned for the worse, Worth turned for the better. Nicky Guadagni's performance definitely deserves a mention, she portrayed her character Holloway with every ounce of believability.The concept of this film was brilliant, and showed that you do not need astounding computer graphics to create something special. The claustrophobic atmosphere was captured well by the screenplay and the design of the green, red and blue rooms, each one holding a new surprise for each individual.One of the other great things about the film, was the difficulty in predicting who would survive, and who would die. Many films and sequels make the mistake of making a hero obvious, thus making him or her immune to being killed off. In this film, however, the heroes became known only toward the end of the film, and thus you fear for each individual in the cube, not just one.Finally, this is a must see for those looking for intrigue and originality.",Cube

The concept is a good one, and the booby-traps are in many cases very effectively portrayed (particularly the first one, but who the hell was that guy anyway?)I agree that it is reminiscent of The Twilight Zone, but certainly not the better episodes. There's an interesting premise with no real payoff. Clearly the Cube is supposed to be some type of a prison (clue #1, all the characters are named for famous prisons), so why should there be any chance of getting out of it in the first place? Where are all the other prisoners? I can understand no guards, but no food or water? While everyone has a 'special talent' that allows them a chance for escape if they pull together, what exactly is the purpose of the cop character? In the long run, he certainly does not assist in any way... far from it.For me, the really good Twilight Zone episodes setup a very interesting premise and completely change your initial impression by the end of the program. There was no 'twist', no 'startling revelation',no big 'payoff'... it just sort of ends. And to be honest, by that point I was pretty much glad that it did.

About halfway trough, I couldn't keep my eyes of the screen and I couldn't wait to see what this all would leed to.(warning, mild spoiler ahead) There is some stuff to think about in here, but it's largely left to your own imagination.

On each wall, ceiling and floor there are doors leading to identical adjacent rooms. They soon find out that some rooms have deadly traps in them and as a result they are killed off one by one as they make their way through the cube searching for a way out until there are only a few left.The plot is fairly straightforward and there are no major twists. While the concept of strangers waking up in a horrible place is not exactly original in the horror genre, the setting is well thought out and the viewer is kept longing for answers about the nature of the cube and who is responsible for it. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times, but it is delivered well by the actors. The characters are a little on the two dimensional side and could have used a bit more exploring.The acting in cube is convincing. Stars David Hewlett and Nicole De Boer went on to make quite a name for themselves in the science fiction genre, but it is interesting to see them in an early low budget film.The direction in cube is superb. The tension is held throughout as the characters slowly go insane. Clever use is made of the limited production value. The whole film is shot on one set, the cube room. Each room is the same set, only lit differently and through clever use of cinematography and editing the characters' journey from room to room is believable.Overall cube is a very good film.

Although I expected a certain amount of rough edges from its indie/low-budget background, I have to say the edges were rougher than I expected. There is a giant chasm between what is good about this movie, and what is bad about it. Personally I can handle movies that are ""wrong"" in some ways, if they have other things going for it. ""Lawnmower Man"" is an example of a movie where viewer forgiveness may go to such extents that the movie becomes enjoyable. ""Cube"", unfortunately, didn't pass this threshold with me.To summarize my thoughts, top-down:1. the basic premise of the movie is excellent, as is the set design 2. on a synopsis level, it's still pretty good, though some aspects (like the ""Rain Man"" type character) look contrived 3. on a script/chain of events level, it's decent, and explores the basic premise well. The complete lack of character exposition is problematic though. 4. on a script/DIALOGUE level, I think it's pretty damn weak, and the acting makes this problem worse.I don't think I've seen a promising movie with such awful dialogue in a long time. The characters, trapped in a hostile environment, start hating each other after about 2 minutes. Idiotic, and bizarrely lacking in psychological realism. And those lofty philosophical exchanges about society, responsibility, existence and so on -- which the characters launch into as if someone had suddenly pressed a button on their backs? If you want to insist on metaphors, why not use your brains and be elegant and original about it?The actors didn't help much. The ""cop"" guy lost all credibility after an OK start, but the female doctor was beyond belief from the first minute. I'm not sure the actors are to blame, as much as the director... but they sure didn't help.I wasn't very impressed with ""Saw"" (the first one), but ""Cube"" made that one look like ""The Shining"". This movie should be re-made with a completely rewritten dialogue, strong actors, and a much improved opening and ending. Too bad.",Cube
297,kylemcdavid-27399,Best Canadian Film and one of the best 90s Horror Film!!!,8,24 September 2017,"Now I don't know that many Canadian films, beside this movie and a film called ""Nothing"" which just so happened to be directed by the same guy who give us this, and a French-Canadian film called ""Polytechnique"" which is about the Montreal Massacre that occurs in 1989, but this would be basically the best Canadian movie, for having both a great interesting and enjoyable-to-watch story and a group of good written characters.The film is pretty much is about a group of people who're complete strangers to each other and are different occupations, one a Police Officer, one a Doctor, one a Math-Majored student, one a Architect, one a prisoner/escaped artist, and one a Mentally Challenged Individual, all trapped inside a mysterious Cube-like building with thousand of rooms, multiple with deadly traps and some without any, which is only proved first with a prime mathematical answer on a door entrance, which is seen on every single one. But with Kazan's (The mentally challenged Character) bad behavior, they may be on a high risk of not being able of getting out alive.To begin with this, I shelled talk about the characters first, beginning with the Cop Quentin. He's such your stereotypical cop as he just a big jerk in the group despite taking their lead, which take me to the next character Worth (The Architect dude) who (Spoiler Alert) is one of the creators of the cube technically as he helps design it, he seems to be at first the film's Antagonist and Quentin being the hero, until we kinda slowly seen these characters taking the opposite way around as Quentin becomes more of a psychopath killing Holloway (The doctor) by purposely dropping her as she attempted to see there a way to get down from a door that just so happened to be a entrance out of the cube, and earlier threatens to kill Kazan for almost having him accidentally kill in another trap that was Sound Activated, and then soon decide to attempts to raped Leaven (The Mathematical Student) and then attempted to killed Worth twice by throwing him into two rooms that he thought were possibly traps, and then finally succeed in doing so, well kinda, by stabbing both him and Leaven (Which kills her) and attempted to make his move on Kazan as he about to walked out the true entrance of the cube, just to only be stopped by a Mortally wounded Worth which lead to Quentin's fate by being torned-apart by the Door shifting again. This kinda what Quentin's character stand-out as the true villain and I don't know how others would view this, but I think it a nice twist of showing Quentin being the bad guy and Worth not, speaking of Worth who I forgot to talk about him, I thought he was a alright character, he actually responsible not just for creating the Cube, but the best scene in the whole film as being quite emotional which is right around when we learned about him, especially him shouting ""THERE NO WAY OUT!"" which was just amazing. David Hewlett who plays Worth, and by far the only recognizable actor in the whole film, except I do know the chick who plays Leaven also plays a main character in a season of ""Star Terk: Deep Space Nine"" and that it, should considered this movie the upbringing of his career. Leaven I don't really have that much to say about her, just she a math Genius of the group, but I'm going to admit, she is kinda pretty:). Holloway was kinda of a nice character to watch, her conversations/relationship with Quentin was kinda interesting to see, and so her relationship with Kazan, as she the only one of the group who seems to have support for him as being someone with mental retardation, and her death was disappointing to see as it would been more nice to see her seeing Kazan's Intellectual secrets. Speaking of Kazan, I'll get to him now, as he is my second favorite of the group, as he sorta like me, as being someone who both have a Intellectual Disability and is on the Autism Spectrum, much like Kazan as he is later classified Autistic, I can totally relate to him, and it always nice to see him on Screen, according to me, and I'm glad he was the only survivor of the group, and as after-all it would been kinda harsh to have a Handicap character getting killed, the same with children. And last and not least, and I did decide to save this one for last, my favorite of the group with a huge disappointment about him however, the Escapist Rennes A.K.A. the ""Wren"". He was just a great character to see as one he's a old timer and that he just seems to be quite wise, which makes him cool. His death is like my biggest problem with this film however, how it not really a general problem he dies, it just too early, early as it was before we're introduced to Kazan. But over-all despite his death, I still find him enjoyable and interesting to watch.Cube is just a fantastic film of Mystery, Thriller, and Horror, it must be watched. Also if you like the Saw series, or want to see a film that is like a strange mash-up of ""Rain-Man"" and ""Saw"", this is totally for him. Just great.",Cube

I think the idea of people trapped in cube is no new at all and even though this movie certainly keeps your attention for more than a hour, by the end you feel that there is no message to reflect on. All what it does is to kind of keep you a bit scare and get you into its plot here and there, but at times it doesn't. Therefore, that's what I'm giving 5 out of 10.",Cube

The acting's not very good, and the dialogue sure doesn't help things--the characters find themselves in this horrific death-trap, yet goofy little dialogue bits and mannerisms are supposed to be amusing in the midst of it. Doesn't work. The movie teases with various ""what-ifs"" and theories as to what could be going on--which is cool, and the only reason for watching the movie--but then it goes about negating all of the interesting possibilities, so that all the viewer's left with is a frustrated hope that something more will come out of the flick...but nothing does (except more frustration).  If the characters are annoying, the dialogue is stupid, the setting barely changes, and the plot/premise is barren and admittedly pointless, one can't really consider this a good movie.  Has some possibilities at the beginning, but soon sets about wiping them out...",Cube

Instead, I was very disappointed.I will tell you why I am disappointed: 1) The use of mathematics is a total insult to my intelligence 2) No beginning - how did the characters get there?  Why? 3) Weak ending - how could Quintin sneak up on them at the end without making any noise opening the door?  Why would Worth give up going outside?

The atmosphere through the whole movie is stunning, you can't help than be scared and caring about the characters who gets killed one by one... It combines elements of a splatter film with the paranoid character of pessimistic science fiction flicks. I hope the director of CUBE will keep going on that way.

It's visuals, also are pretty good for it's time. The cinematography is somwehat outdated, but still works pretty good.I thought the writing was really on and off though. At times the writing was really weak, and seemed somewhat rushed. The actung was also at times in the movie bad from some of the actors, which really took me out of the mood of the movie.

Once again, don't just view this as a bizarre sci-fi flick, and please don't write it off so quickly.

The characters, though at times melodramatic, all propelled the story and mood instead of trying to scramble for Best Actor/Actress award.  The result is a tight, unpredictable cast, amazing sets, and a concept of not only a personal hell, but a very original one.  Though some of the plot revolves around number-theory and math, don't worry...you don't have to understand any of it.  This is a lower-budget, yet thrice as intense version of ""Event Horizon.""  I can say without hesitation that this was one of the best movies of the 97-98 period.  Check it out, you'll be glad you did...and scared to walk into the next room.",Cube

306,ilovelctr,A great show but feels as if it were coming out of nowhere,8,2 December 2010,"Cube's a very alternative style that totally separates itself from any major horror/suspense drama. That said, you get some really intriguing setting here - some people get trapped in a big big cube and they're trying to get out with using their wisdom together.Along the way, some situation takes place and that's where the human nature of different kinds unfolds. Sure it reaches some depth but is held back by the story's simplicity. However, perhaps nothing way too complicated can be expected from such an adventure set in a cube apart from the outside world. When you look at the bright side, the film offers you a lot of entertaining moments just down in its own special setting and it's rather focused on its topic - being atmospheric. If it were lengthier, it would probably be more classic, though that's just my guessing.The movie does have something to deal with human nature. More specifically speaking, there are selfishness, desire for revenge for some trifles, and warmth in our hearts of course. It's generally believable but sometimes is ruined by certain exaggerated acting. The music score intensifies mood at times but sometimes it feels lacking, when you feel that there should be some...In general it's a great film, especially considering how it explores human nature while serving as a horror film but the setting feels like it's coming out of nowhere and totally unexplained; that's the part where Saw does better. After all, it's a must-see for horror fans.",Cube

Maybe if we'd stayed till the end, some epiphany would have exploded in our minds to leave us loving this movie like so many other people seem to? Did we leave too soon? Did the acting get better? Was there some brilliant movie making that was just about to happen right after we turned it off?

Why?Not a bad premise but so ridiculous and badly acted that I can't see why anyone would give it more than 5 stars. The actors who played Quentin and Holloway were so bad that I looked them up and was surprised to see they had actually appeared in other films. I can give the actors a break though since the characters were so unbelievable that maybe no one could have make them believable.One big problem, the coordinates Leven is supposed to work out. If the rooms move, wouldn't their coordinates have to change? So you would never know where you are. Other people have already pointed out Leaven's inability to recognize that numbers that end in 5 or 2 can't be prime or that Kazan was wrong about the number of prime factors of various numbers. These are details that make a difference. Anyone who knows a lot about math (not me in other words) would just slap their forehead and turn Cube off. Which is what I should have done.",Cube
310,Covey-3,Poor characterisation detracts from original idea,7,23 May 2000,"Cube, while wholly original and engaging, suffers from one major flaw, its characters.As a concept, the film is faultless. Take 5 different people from different backgrounds and place them into a void of uncertainty and the unknown. From scene to scene they have to interact and help each other in order to discover a way of escaping from the spiders web. To an extent aswell, the film delivers on this level. Tension is created between the character (if seemingly manufactured and false at times) is present, the five stereotypes realise their difference, their weaknesses and their strengths and continue on in their plight. As a background to this, the concept of the Cube, a squared prison that these people have been unknowingly placed in serves to as to the mysterium of the story. We 'are' drawn in and we 'are' intrigued. So where does the film falter? Characters.When I watched this film, I found that out of the five different characters, only one seemed remotely likeable and real. That character being Leaven, wonderfully acted by Nicola De Boeur. Aside from Leaven's innocent, yet intelligent mind, we are left with four wholly unlikeable people whose only purpose in life seems to be to hinder and to annoy. Quentin, the stereotypical black cop. Brutal, family man who beat his children but who snaps at the slightest twinge. Holloway, the paranoid, neurotic doctor who seems to spend every waking hour of her days dreaming up far fetched conspiracy theories. Worth, the designer of the exterior who feels that it isn't important to tell everyone that he knows what they are inside, when quizzed as to why not, ""I didn't ask"" is the lamest and most wholly selfish reply anybody could give. And finally, Kazan, the mentally handicapped, who despite the morals of the story, does act as a liability. His only use is to turn everyone against each other. When his purpose is finally revealed, even then he serves to turn person against person.This is a story about characters. The only trouble is, we need characters we can identify with, not characters who we deplore. It almost seems fitting that the only person to escape from the Cube is the one person who has the least chance of making it on the outside.Great idea. Bad characters.",Cube

I enjoyed the scenes with Rennes, but all the other characters are thoroughly badly written and acted - none of them are remotely believable.

313,Virginia_Farmboy,Think outside the box,6,1 August 2007,"I remembering hearing about ""Cube"" when it was released, but for ten years I hadn't gone out of way to see it. Well, I recently did and I can't say I didn't get what I expected. However, I didn't get anymore than that, which is a disappointment. ""Cube"" has an interesting concept, but it's little more than a gimmick. A half dozen people are trapped in a cube, but why are they there? What is the cube's purpose? These questions aren't exactly answered.Lest you think it's an existentialist analysis of humanity, a few body-shredding traps make their appearance throughout the movie. This does make for a nice, tense, atmosphere and some good scenes, especially when the characters must get through a room where a trap is sprung by the slightest of sounds.What I wanted was more out of the characters. I wanted them to be more than stereotypes. There's the bookish math whiz, the autistic savant, the resigned office worker, the outraged liberal, and the fascist cop. We are led to believe, due to the math geniuses have a key role, that all the characters were put in the cube with some purpose, but no other character uses his or her specialty to further the plot, so, I'm wondering, why give everyone polar opposite personalities and jobs if nothing is going to come of them? I thought the best characters were that of the cop, Quentin, and the prison escape, Rennes, though Quentin later becomes a typical movie villain and Rennes is on screen for only a brief time.I appreciated it's concept and it's execution, as the production design was so simple I could believe it (only one set was used). But its writing left something to be desired, and I wanted more personality from the characters. I realize this wasn't supposed to be a classic of cinema, but I do expect some deviation from tired formulas.",Cube

In the original it was one man trapped in the cube who constantly receives visits from others who can get into the cube and leave at will. Now on to the film at hand Cube is a sci-fi film that is one of the most thought provoking films you will ever see. Six strangers with no recollection on where they are or indeed how they got there must navigate a booby trapped Cube shaped prison(pretty simple huh?)not.As the movie progresses the line between good and evil gets blurred as well as sanity.Completely character driven with often sharp dialog Cube offers much more than it's one set,yes only one,they revamp with lights and clever camera angles.Hard core sci-fi fans will recognize Nicole deBoer from Star Trek Deep Space Nine and the god awful Dead Zone TV shows.Insightful often suspenseful Cube is a must see for those who enjoy smart film making my only complaint was the ending I saw it coming 20 mins into the film which is why i'm giving it an eight.

Other than the girl who plays the student, I've never seen any of the actors before, which makes the movie much harder to predict than most.  The air of mystery prevails throughout.

Well you'll feel the fear 1000x times more when watching this movie. The opening sequence of the movie makes it look like a bad horror film at first, but Cube has so much more to offer.One of the best things with this movie were the actors, they were all really good. I almost felt like they were playing themselves which I rarely feel while watching movies. The plot is simple, seven strangers wake up in an endless maze with death traps. But what Vincenzo Natali focuses on is how the different characters change during this time. That is what kept me worried, excited and scared all the time.Few low budget movies can build so much excitement as Cube did, and that's why I really liked it. I haven't seen the two sequels yet but you can't make sequels to movies like these. I'm happy with the first one and I think you should watch it. But as I said, the actors are really what makes this movie so good, I'm pretty sure that if there would be a known cast it would have been a lot worse. If you want an exciting adventure, then watch Cube. This is true cult.",Cube

It doesn't have as many cool traps and creative deaths as the other _Cube_ movies, but what it lacks in gore, it more than makes up for with its good acting and characters. It's fascinating to watch the charas' relationships evolve, from initial paranoia (who are these people and where do they come from?) to a spirit of camaraderie as they feel determined to solve the puzzle, deteriorating back to paranoia, fear, and hatred as the cube proves harder to solve than anyone expected. If you want to see a big, scary, trap-filled cube kill a lot of people in new and interesting ways, watch the other movies, though; this one is about the people.",Cube

But, after a few hours I realized that the plot was extremely flawed and left a lot to be desired.  There really was no explanation for why they were in the cube and how they got there.  Nor was there any rationality for the killing of the doctor.  Why did the cop risk his own life to save her, only to drop her?  There are many examples of this.

The anguished confession of one character's involvement in the cube's construction, combined with the conspiracy theories of the others, unpleasantly reminded me of ""The Andromeda Strain"", another film in which what could have been an excellent science/philosophy thriller was spoiled by political ranting.

325,caenleranzo,"Watchable, But Dated and Doesn't Have Impressive Dialogue",5,29 March 2020,"So, I found this film on YouTube for free. I thought this would be an interesting movie to watch. Cube was watchable because it had characters with different ages and diverse personalities. And then, it had the cube that caused psychological warfare on the vulnerable and ignorant characters that tried to get out of the cube to save their lives. Which made it have a higher chance of trying to scare the audience who watch this. However, I was not scared and was curious instead. Quentin, Joan, David, Kazan, Helen, Rennes, and Alderson were the characters that intrigued me enough that I was wondering what would happen if they worked together. Joan would be considered the smart yet sensitive girl that gets trapped in the cube, and then she attempts to find a way to get untrapped. Quentin was the aggressive and ""empathetic?"" predator who tried to promote efficient teamwork with the characters in the face of danger to get out of the cube. David was the practical but cynical man that made the outer shell of the cube who was most likely not going to get out of the cube no matter how much he contributed to helping the group of characters to escape their entrapment. Helen, the doctor with conspiracy thinking and optimism, was trying to help the characters collaborate with each other even though some of them seem to have a less likelihood of surviving. Rennes embodies the personality of an escape artist who is an opportunist that tried to get away from the cube independently until he meets the characters. Kazan appears to have special intelligence yet I'm wondering if Kazan was a former employee that made the cube but got turned into a mentally challenged person because the people who made the cube made sure Kazan could never remember how to get out of the cube. Though, I'm not sure what to say about Alderson. All of these characters in this Cube project were all created well except for their dialogue to some extent. This film looks dated because of the lack of enough technological advancement for me, so I felt kind of numb the entire time since I've already watched many horror films at this point in my life.",Cube

It's quite graphic at times, but its horror lies in the claustrophobic fear of being trapped in a strange place. The characters are diverse and well-acted, and I ended up caring for them. The plot wasn't too complex, but it didn't need to be. This is the simple story of humans trapped in a nightmare, seeking a way out despite the likelihood they never will.Best of all, the Cube is never explained, and what it's for and how it got there is something left to your imagination.

But what if you wake up in a Cube with five other persons and you can't get out.
Wouldn't you wonder what your fate would be?Cube is the debut film of Vincente Natali, who won allot of awards with this already instant-classic cult film. In this intelligent, original fantastic movie six people are trying to get out of a cube. In the cube you will find a police officer, a mathematic student, a psychologist, a thief, an autistic person and the person who partially helped with building the cube.None of them know why they are in this and what the purpose is of the cube.

329,DamRho,Overhyped,6,9 August 2004,"Cube is usually hyped as being a cult horror movie but it clearly gets lost along the way. The problem with this movie is that it's way too long for what it offers the viewers: repetitive action, completely useless chat, characters that we just don't - and won't - care about, and extremely poor mathematics. In the end it's just another mindless low budget sci-fi movie that is commonly overhyped and definitely over rated (I am amazed how it has the same score as 28 Days Later, which is an absolutely superb movie by Danny Boyle and far superior to Cube). Cube has already spawned a sequel that is nothing but more of the same, and it seems like it will spawn a prequel which may be a ray of hope for this trilogy if the screenplay evolves in quality. Cube is not the worst movie you will ever see though, it's entertaining and it does bring curiousity to see what happens in the end, but it's also not a work of art. If you're a horror/sci-fi fan you'll enjoy this if you can look past the horrible mathematics displayed in this movie.",Cube

331,johnv-3,Interesting Premise - But Leaden Dialogue Weights It Down,7,25 July 1999,"If you're going to a movie like this one, kind of a sci-fi/horror version of Waiting for Godot, then the characters and the dialogue are crucial. This is where this film falls down. The characters are essentially one dimensional, and while some show growth and development over the course of the film, most remain undeveloped. The dialogue is at times leaden, with endless and heated discourses on the ""military-industrial complex"" and other such ""political"" issues. Like other reviewers, I can see why it was a hit in France. I kept expecting a character to announce something like ""OK, lets escape from here and all go to Starbucks to discuss the philosophical implications on the destruction of individualism and it's impact on society"". This is the sort of leaden discussions one continues to read in European intellectual circles, and seems particularly popular amongst some of the intelligentsia in France. Alas, class issues and the nefarious doings of the military industrial complex have little resonance in 1999 USA.In the story itself the characters actions often seem illogical and forced at times. I know that they're supposed to be under stress, but they also seem pretty slow to catch on for a group of hyper bright people. The portrayal of the autistic savant came perilously close to being insulting, saved only by the actors skill. The other actors (mainly no-names) also give it a good shot, particularily give the material they had to work with. The ending seemed contrived, and some plot resolution in terms of the why and how would have improved the film.The best role I see for this film is as a discussion piece for undergraduate Poli Sci and Philosophy classes. Professors and TA's take note.5 out of 10, mainly for acting and the innovative use of cheap sets.",Cube

I liked the fact that they concentrated on what was happening, and leaving it up to you to wonder who was behind it all, and how the characters originally got there. It was also interesting to watch how the characters reacted to their situation, and what was happening to them; it was like watching a sociology experiment in progress. On the downside, though, the ending was absolutely horrible (left me wondering what the point of the whole thing had been) and watching Quentin, the police officer chew the scenery was downright painful. It would also have been nice to take parts of the characters interactions a bit further. All in all, though, an interesting movie, and one I would watch again.",Cube
333,lulu88,Not only a disturbing portrayal of human nature,8,7 July 2002,"It's disturbing, yes, but I still see this movie as being good natured basically. It's pretty much a portrayal of how people react to different pressures in life -- some will withdraw from reality, some resort to violence, betrayal or blaming others as their burden... it is under such pressure that the good or evil deep rooted in one's mind comes into play -- in the end it's the ""good"" and ""innocent"" that is able to find the way out (although ""evil"" follows closely). Try looking at pressure and teamwork from a different perspective and see if you get any inspiration from this movie...

It is a well made constructed thriller about the human psyche.,Cube
338,geertvdheide,"Original, intriguing, but not perfect",7,15 August 2007,"Cube came as a surprise to the world, with its low budget approach and unique premise of a group of very different people trapped in a moving futuristic maze. I found the film to be quite interesting. The acting isn't Oscar worthy, but it's not bad either. The characters have just enough back story and screen time to create some connection with the viewer. The visuals are low budget, but never really ugly or fake.My problem with the movie is that it never really blew my mind. The basic plot is interesting, as is the math and the psychology behind it. But that's really all there is. I found this movie could have been better had it had more twists and turns, more content. Cube is a pretty straight forward Science Fiction horror film, which is OK. It's just not completely amazing or particularly memorable.I do recommend watching Cube, because it is by no means a bad movie. Just don't expect it to shake the foundations of your mind like some rare Science Fiction movies do.",Cube
339,Nicol_Bolas,"Great premise, damaged by the ending",6,24 February 2008,"Basically, this movie is exactly what the DVD box cover says: 6 people are trapped inside a maze/death-trap. They try to get out.It isn't really about the prison, though. It's about how people react to stress. And it's about the design of the prison.The basic premise reads like a Twilight-Zone episode. 6 people wake up in a series of interconnected rooms. Some of these rooms kill their occupants in various ways.Each person was placed there with a specific function in mind. One person is a cop, who has leadership qualities. One is a doctor, able to treat the wounded. One is a high-school student, who's math knowledge is still fresh in her mind. One is one of the people who built a component of the place, who brings unique knowledge of the prison. One is apparently autistic, able to perform complex math computations easily. One is an escape artist loner-type who gets himself killed early on to remind the audience that anyone can die.The prison acts as a personality-conflict engine, as it forces people to interact to save each other's lives and their own.It's a great premise, the interlocking prison that they have to figure out the secrets to. And, as with any human endeavor, dealing with each other becomes increasingly hard as dehydration and stress wear down their patience.The problem comes when one of them, quite suddenly, snaps and starts killing them. For no apparent reason.I understand that tensions were running high. But when the most likable and reasonable character in the entire movie starts going nuts and killing people for no apparent reason, it kinda sullies the character interactions.Granted, this was a problem with the dialog as a whole. People thrust into the situation seemed entirely too unwilling to tell each other things. I can understand panic. But after an hour in the death maze, when someone asks what skills you could contribute, I would expect people to give a full resume/CV including personal histories, not, ""I'm a doctor, like 10 million others."" There was a lot of confrontation in the movie, even at the beginning when dehydration and exhaustion hadn't set in yet. They just seemed to want to argue rather than attempt to reason a way out.Despite the ending and a degree of contravity with the dialog, the movie works reasonably well.",Cube
340,MWFD,Fantastic voyage into the human psyche,9,31 January 1999,As a student of psychology I can really appreciate this film.  Watching this movie really makes me wonder how I would react in a similar situation.  I just think it's fantastic that such an intriguing and inventive story can keep you engrossed in a film while limited to only three sets (2 of which are only seen for a few minutes).  It's nice to see all the canadian (no-name) actors giving such steller performances.,Cube
341,horton-2,"Great concept, bad actors",8,4 November 2000,"I just kind of stumbled onto this movie so I had absolutely no idea what it was about.  Didn't even see any shots of the movie itself, nor the cover art.Going in, I'd have to say the premise is one of the best I've heard so far. All these people, all so very different, situated in one small area with one common potentially lethal dilemma.  It's fantastic.  They never revealed how they got there or who put them there but that's part of what makes it good. About 30 minutes into the movie, it dawned on me that this is basically something like a Tales From the Darkside or a Twilight Zone that got made into a movie.  Both those shows were primarily made of great stories woven around a small number of characters and cheap sets.  This is what the movie basically was.  If you liked those shows, you'll enjoy this movie.The only drawback I saw were the acting.  Some of the primary characters, the cop for one, absolutely sucked.  It was nice how he tried to appear the nice leader at first and changed, but overall that guy is not a very good actor.  The autistic guy was horrible as well.  Must all autistic people be good at math or have good memory?  Well, in Hollywood they all do it seems. Worth's character was very well acted though.  I liked him a lot and hope to see more in the future.I'll admit though that one bad showing doesn't mean they'll always be bad. Just look at Hillary Swank from The New Karate Kid and then compare that to Boys Don't Cry.Overall I gave it a 8.  Worthy of a rental for sure.",Cube

343,garethwatkin,a Science-Fiction Character Study,9,7 January 2008,"Cube is one of rare films that highly pleases me. Despite having many clerical errors throughout, Cube is an example of Science-Fiction at its best.Throughout the film, we find ourselves constantly asking thousands of questions, about the origins of the Cube and the People inside the Cube. It becomes apparent, that these questions will never get answered (unless you watch the sequel, and prequel, which are highly dissatisfying) Cube is known as a Science-Fiction movie, but some people don't realise that it is more of a character study. As the film progresses, we are shown different characters, and how their situation shifts and changes them, until our own views we had at the beginning are completely transformed.So, in conclusion, if you have not seen this film, i highly recommend it.",Cube

CUBE, however, manages to do this with an interesting and highly claustrophobic twist.But that's it - there is a twist at the end of this movie. One of those awful, pointless, non sequitur twists that spoils the entire 90 mins.Some twists are clever, intriguing and thought provoking.

It was the most predictable, yawn-making pile of verbose nonsense I've seen in quite a while. The characters were not very realistic, and smacked of contrivance. The visuals were dull, and if this was intentional, to give a sense of uniformity and regularity to the cuboid maze, could there not have been some slighlty more interesting camerawork?

I tend to think otherwise.

She was perfectly cast!",Cube
349,comix8,"A little bit of a headache maker, but good",8,6 August 1999,"Without knowing much about this movie except the basic plot I sat down to watch the video that my friend has lent me.  The opening sequence was enough to make me want to turn it off, because it was just too confusing for the beginning of a movie.  After I got past the dead guy, it turned into a movie that was pretty good.  The dialogue was a little lagging, but I think it was mostly due to the fact that the entire movie was spent talking.  There are short bits of action, but nothing to major to allow a few minutes of silence.  The continuous talking led to more and more questions and a bunch of confusing characters.The one biggest flaw that the movie has is that none of the characters keep a personality throughout the movie except for the thief, but he doesn't live long enough to change.  I found it hard to care about a cop that keeps changing from good to evil.  The doctor was a little bit too annoying for my taste because she was shy at the beginning, but then suddenly grew a backbone.  The student was good because she actually grew with her character changes.  Having to go through all of those numbers will change a person. The ""businessman"" was a little too glum for my taste.  He just sat around the entire time until he had one significant part in the whole movie, and then he faded into the background again, but would reappear to say something stupid.  The guy with the mental problem was very well done.  It seemed as though he really did have a problem.  My only complaint with him is how he suddenly would hang from the ceiling to climb through that one blue room (you'll see when you watch it).  Overall, the characters were a little lacking, but I still cared about two of them.Overall, I wouldn't say that the film was memorable, but it was still a film.  A movie is something that spends a lot of money to bring monsters to New York and an asteroid toward Earth with only Ben Afflack to save it.  A film, on the other hand, is something that actually gets you to think.  A lot of independent movies are films (Blair Witch Project is a good example. So is An Ideal Husband.), but this is one that rides the edge.  I think that this film was good, but not overly memorable.  I'm glad that I saw it, but I feel even better that I got to see it for free.  (8 out of 10, but only for the two characters and a few parts of the plot.  The two off are mostly for the headache I got when trying to figure out that number thing.)",Cube

The Cube is not a good movie, it isn't that fun, it isn't worth more than 15 minutes of your time, but it sure would be better if it were only 15 minutes long, as that's all the time you need to get this movie: different people are stuck in a cube and have to get along or die because the government blah blah blah. Toss in a little science fiction and you've something about as gripping as the time the people got stuck on the elevator on ""General Hospital."" That's not to say it's a completely bad movie... it's not.  It's okay considering it's an indie B-movie, but it's nowhere near ""the best movie ever made"" or the 7/10 rating it's currently got on IMDB.

As a rule I find ratings here are pretty accurate, but this one however is way off the mark. Several characters stuck in a cube, some obviously chosen for their particular ability, but others seem to have just been put there to make a story, then have them blunder from room to room for a while, watch how they interact a bit, then kill off most of them at the end.Performances across the board are OK so my real complaint is with the writers as they take us through the cube, nothing is ever resolved or explained - yeah, we get to hear that no one is currently in charge of the cube, but please, don't insult viewers by simply asking us to believe that this thing just magically got built with no conceivable purpose but to zap people! Then there's the ending - talk about lack of resolution. This was definitely a case of 'ok, we have enough film in the can, time to quit' - and that's exactly what they do. Had the writers spent some time and come up with a creative ending, it could have save this film and made it a true 7.5. But as is, I'd say take a pass unless it's the only thing available.",Cube

Seven people find themselves trapped inside a strange maze-like building. How they got there, who's responsible and why they were chosen, we never do learn. 2. Stereotype characters: Military-psycho, maths genius, doctor, autistic. Don't you think we've seen film characters like that a bit too many times? 3. At the beginning, we get to see that many of the rooms have deadly traps in them. Towards the ending of the film, however, the characters start moving from room to room without any fear, as all the traps have probably disappeared (?) 4. The most common phrase is 'Wait, I think I found out the answer' (to where the exit is). You get to hear that about ten times, as each 'logical idea' tragically fails after a while. 5. The first one to get out of the cube (we never get to know what is 'out there') is the autistic guy-how original! 6. All through the film you will find numerous rip-offs, especially from the X-Files (the general conspiracy idea) and from other films and TV series. Note: the X-files are also being made in Canada. Coincidence?The outcome is, you will probably reach for the stop button long before they find the exit (which of course is where the movie ends).

The opening sequence has a man diced into cubes as he attempts to cross a room. I thought this part was very cool. Unfortunately, that was easily the sweetest thing in the movie. The only other death caused by the rooms was a spurt of acid that miraculously landed right on the guys face. Sadly, the sweetness of the room effects was overshadowed by the atrocious acting and even more pathetic dialogue. Perhaps the saddest part of the movie was its attempt to incorporate mathematics. This could've been one of the best parts of the film if they'd decided to have even a single mathematician proofread the script. Using the words 'prime' 'factor' and 'cartesian' doesn't make it mathematically profound or philosophical, or correct. Nor does mentioning Descartes' name. As the girl proved, wearing glasses does not make you a math genius. They were all terrible actors, but the doctor was so comically bad I couldn't help rooting for the psychopathic cop who dropped her off the edge. Was he supposed to be hero? But if they'd only stayed in the room, they wouldn't have been driven mad and perhaps the cop never would've lost his mind and killed all the people...are you serious? And the annoying autistic man is the only one to make it out? What? No matter what way you try to justify the characters motives they're all idiotic. If you have even a semblance of logic this movie will not make any sense. What would be sweet is if this movie were remade in 5-10 years with a decent script, some people who can act, and at least one profound mathematical concept. I swear, real ones do exist. Only someone 13 or younger could buy into this movie, but it's slightly too gory for anyone that young. So who is this movie for? In the words of Gene Wilder, ""you know...morons.""",Cube
365,TwistedIvory,Cube v. Hypercube,6,20 March 2003,"I've watched Cube and Hypercube both in the past two days and come out with the conclusion that Hypercube is by far the superior movie, and undeservedly underrated. Theoretically and cognitively, Hypercube pushes boundaries where the first doesn't tread; the first relied on shoddy plot devices and banal dialogue (""You Nat-zee!""  ""You!  Woman!"") to further the psychosis, whereas the second used the unpredictability of the situation to develop plot. Granted, the second had a few lacunae in logic and plot, but it was far cinematographically superior.  The stark colors and environs conveyed a sense of claustrophobia that the original didn't; furthermore, the use of color was by far more symbolic in the sequel.  In the original, the color was simply random and chaotic -- and, worse, unexplained.My $0.02:  Hypercube earns a 9 for imagination and scope.  Cube earns a 6 for slipshod photography, dialogue, and plot gaps.Buy, rent or download Hypercube if you want an immersing experience.

366,ddd3,Brilliant concept but... (Spoilers 2nd para),6,7 January 2006,"Definitely a budget release, set in a series of identical cubic rooms identified only by a series of numbers and the colour of the lighting, the set budget must have been one of the lowest of all time, but it works. The feeling of claustrophobia engendered by the seemingly endless series of cubes becomes quite palpable. There are, of course, traps to be avoided, or the film would have become very boring very quickly, and the idea is that all the characters need to combine their skills in order to find their way out. The idea is unusual and bursts with promise (If you can endure the characters occasionally becoming uncharacteristically verbose), then it begins to unravel...It won't be long before the word 'Rubic's' springs to mind. Certainly you'll catch on much faster than the characters involved, and since the idea is that the characters should assist one another you are soon left wondering what skill the very first victim of the cube might have had, since he dies before meeting any of the other participants, and although it isn't stipulated how long the survivors slept for, it seems unlikely that they were in the cube for more than maybe a day, so why, having reached the exit, does one of them panic because he's suddenly scared of the outside and wants to remain where he feels safe? (Safe? With no food or water?... Duh.). Since no tools or weapons were allowed in the cube, where does the crazy cop suddenly get his spike from? If the entrances make so much noise, how does he sneak in to a cube without anyone noticing? and how does he get the young girl out? Then there's the ending... It's really a little depressing that such an involving and well thought out movie can be spoilt by a mind-bendingly idiotic conclusion, but unfortunately that's it. If you switch off when the designer-guy starts to panic at the exit and make up your own ending, you'll enjoy it SO much more...",Cube

Why are those people are placed on the cubes, how they are bond with each other, what is the purpose, what happens when they get out? There is no answer for any of these questions, you just watch a few people who are trying to pass one cube to another and try to find the exit. When one of them do, you don't see what happens next or why they were placed to the cubes. You only watch the fights they do because of desperation and the logical moves they do to get out of the hidden trapped rooms. Don't expect too much.

370,dylanpatrickbaldwin,A Thrilling and Surprisingly Thoughtful Little Gem,9,5 December 2015,"I know that this film is very well known, but I don't believe that it is generally given due credit for its accomplishments, which are myriad. Despite the surprisingly low budget for the production, director Vincenzo Natali succeeds at crafting a very taut, interesting, and extremely well-paced thriller with very fleshed out characters, a rarity in the science fiction horror genre. Throughout the film's 80 minute runtime, not only is the audience able to observe the very well-designed, claustrophobic and surreal sets progress seemingly into infinity, but also the excellent dialogue between the characters further develop them as very believable people. While this film is replete with the usual scares and thrilling set pieces for which this genre is known, it goes the extra mile by remaining totally unpredictable on a story level throughout. From the beginning to final sequence, no character's motivations, backstory, or final outcome are known for certain. With the claustrophobic atmosphere and very good acting from all around, Natali invites the audience to dive deep into the depths of human suspicion, paranoia, and ultimate decline when placed in unconquerable situations. However, while this is a significant part of the film, what truly put Cube over the top for me was its surprising subtext regarding not only the typical topics encountered in science fiction horror fare, but also a far more broad and relatable human message of the struggle to maintain some sense of being and purpose in the face of purposelessness. Perhaps I am reading too deeply into this by making these claims, but I feel that the titular Cube may represent life as a whole; a series of seemingly pointless choices and pitfalls in the form of a puzzle. Only by perseverance through even the darkest depths of human psychology can anyone hope to escape the labyrinth and achieve transcendence. The film's ending, though I won't spoil it, gives new meaning to this message, and leaves much food for thought. Despite all of this praise, I can't quite bring myself to give this film a 10. There are a few very clichéd moments in the film, near the beginning especially, and only around the 25 minute mark does it really begin to feel like something entirely original. However, once it does, it becomes an immersive and potent piece of science fiction.",Cube

379,pamp061,Simplicity makes this movie unique and enjoyable.,10,12 November 2001,"I first saw a flier for this movie in a pub downtown, and assumed it was just pretentious and didn't see it in the theaters. What a pity, because when I saw it on video, I was amazed. It was a beautiful, and very frightening film.A lot of people didn't get the point when *SPOILER* the cubes purpose was not clearly revealed. This frustration is supposed to, and from my point of view, adds to the feelings of anxiety which the film makers intended the audience to feel. This film is intended to be a thinkers film, and not a hollywood sci-fi revamp of The Great Escape.For a film with such a small budget, it did extraordinarily well. The cuts, with only minor exceptions, were very well done, as was the camerawork (which was done by a hand held for the most part!). The film is surreal, but at the same time coherent in its story and characters.The surreality comes from the environment that the characters find themselves trapped in. A simple regular structure of cubes, with mechanical doors leading to each one. Some are trapped. However, the cube 'plays fair' - numbers on the door reveal the location, and whether the rooms are trapped, and the way to the exit. There is, of course, no explanation on how to interperet these numbers. The prisoners must discover this for themselves.The simplicity of the environment is what makes this film unique and enjoyable. The environment is totally regular and very intimidating. It's alien nature comes from its mathematical regularity, and its uncompromising inhumanity due to this attribute.However, although the cube is the central presence in the film, it is mostly there in an ambient sense. The film instead focuses on how the prisoners deal with their abduction and placement in this environment. It is a film about how people deal with each other, and how stupid people can be.I loved the actors in this film, especially the woman playing Holloway -she played the neurotic hysteric with real flair. I just loved the line 'Somebody, builds a widget in Saskatoon without knowing what it's for, and then it ends up TWO MILES UNDER THE DESERT; AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT IN A DEATH MACHINE!'. Of course, explanations on the cubes purpose are scant. The closest answer comes from one member of the group which worked on designing part of it (without knowing its purpose). And the answer is frightening.The sound track, if it could be called that is totally appropriate. It lacks melody and has a simple malevolent ambience, which I found a little reminiscent of movies like 'The Terminator' (I know they are very different movies). The sound effects inside the cube are frightening - strange mechanical sounds and reverberations add to its feel. Without them, the movie wouldn't have been half as good as it was.This movie is a one of a kind and is definitely worth seeing. I don't think I'll see a movie quite like this again - however I hope I will, and I hope I'll find one somewhere.By the way, when watching this movie, prepare to be disturbed.",Cube
380,bad-mojo,Makes me proud I'm from the same country as this flick...,9,26 July 2002,"Spoiler Alert A mind-boggingly amazing movie. What can I say about it? Well, for starters, it conjures up more suspence than many Hollywood action movies. The nature of the rooms and of the Cube itself is just chilling as you sit and try to figure out what the characters are trying to figure out.And as for the characters, they are amazing. When we first meet them, they seem stereotypical, but this works to the advantage of the movie as their depth is further explored, confirming that although the stereotypes are true, their is a genuine motivation and psychology behind them (as with real human beings.)The fact that this movie was literally shot with one primary set and maybe two more sets (for the cube exterior and hallway) at the most is just amazing. The movie is completely character driven as the people trapped within the cube go from fighting the cube itself to fighting each other.The movie, we discover in the end, is about the inner workings of man. The characters (all named after prisons) are all prisoners of themselves, of their own negative emotions, of their own weaknesses. Quentin's brutality, Leaven's intellectual isolation, Rennes' cockiness, Kazan's innocence, Holloway's outspokeness to cover herself, Worth's empty cynacism, repeated so many times its nothing more than a mantra.This movie is genuinely suspenceful, truly terrifying, and completely fantastic. It is the indy-art flick by which all others should be measured. To compare, it honestly puts Reservoir Dogs and El Mariachi to shame in that those were stylistic action flicks pulled with no budget, while this is a stylish suspence movie with no budget. Now which do you think is harder to do?If you love movies, rent this one. Its beyond incredible.",Cube
381,ruzin08,Very stupid movie barely watchable,2,13 March 2017,"Well well well I wanted to stop writing reviews because I have no reason to anymore but this movie was bad enough to make me want to warn you!!! Okay so for anyone who haven't watched the movie yet my suggestion is don't watch it. I expected a lot because I knew the plot and it sounded interesting but it isn't. It's bad on many ways. Below the review with spoilers.HOW MINDNUMBINGLY STUPID THAT MOVIE WAS? I couldn't believe it.... From the beginning the movie focus more on the philosophical part than the survival and mystery part. All the metaphors and the analogies about society and humanity as a whole that is stupid and evil, in the end it seems to conclude that humanity is like the crazy cop. Violent, sexist and wants to have power and control....ye ye ye...what a bunch of horseshit. It's what a teenager in the 90s thought about the world...You know what? That opinion even then was outdated!! It's just plain stupid. The young girl said at one point: ''Even when I was 7 I felt guilty for ruining the world"" Wait what?!!!! If a 7 year old feel this way they should go see a child psychiatrist ASAP!! Come on the world is not evil the world is not stupid it's just the world...Sure there are a lot of bad things going on but still there are a lot of good things too. This movie throws every stereotype and cliché in your face. Even when it doesn't seem to make any sense! When the cop kills the doctor everything was going well but suddenly the cop changes expression like a demon possessed him all of a sudden he seem to think oh gee everything is going OK we might get out of here why don't I kill the doctor of the group..... OK he was aggressive but there is a gap between being aggressive and angry and start killing people....also the way it progresses is very bad..One time a puzzle the next a stereotype next all humanity is evil and stupid next one guy gets batshit crazy and starts killing people...wtf was going on??!!! Jesus..To conclude the movie focuses on stupid philosophical ideas and not on the mystery,it leaves you no choice to judge for yourself and the characters are badly written. It uses the cube as a mean to pass stupid metaphors and a very false perspective on the world and humanity...The dialogue is laughable, the characters represent something else and the movie is getting more and more ridiculous as time progresses.

The problem here are not only that SOME of these rooms are booby trapped to kill the ones who enter, but the majority of the rooms are a puzzle. Acting isn't the best here. It reminds me a lot of Saw 2. (Which had better acting) The people's personality changes in the cube. Good guys become suspicious and bad guys become worse. I recommend this movie. Part 2 isn't nearly as good but worth the watch, and at this point you might as well watch the 3rd installment as well were we learn more about the operations going on behind the cube. All in all I give this movie 4/5**** and the trilogy as a whole 3.5/5** worth the watch (some parts are pretty bad but the good overshadows the bad.) A worthy entry in the trilogy game.

Who cares!? This movie is SO predictable, I knew what was going to happen a quarter of the way through. As for the acting...GAG ME! This movie is BAD ACTING 101. I've seen better actors in High School plays. I'm always anxious to see small budget films, or just films that aren't your run of the mill film.

Let's throw in the ever-important guy who knows more about the situation than he's letting on, the doctor, and the semi-psychotic guy.What more can I say?  This movie was a lame, poorly acted, predictable, poorly-written rehash of an overdone story idea.  I think the episode of Star Trek:  TNG that I saw with a similar plot was better -- not exactly the greatest compliment.I predicted probably half of the plot details.  The other half was do absurd I couldn't possibly predict that the writers would insult my intelligence by writing it.  If you are the type of person who can sit back and watch a movie without thinking the writer, director, and all the actors are playing a secret little joke on you for having actually paid them for this heap of garbage, then maybe you will like it.

The fact that this movie gets anything more than a 2 by anyone is testiment to the fact that they are in fact confused.

390,masked film critic,Bleak but endlessly inventive Canadian sci-fi,8,13 March 2000,"""Cube"" is certainly a unique movie.  With only one set to play with, the movie sustains the interest throughout.  Basically, it's high concept stuff. Six manifestly incompatible characters are trapped inside a massive cube full of interconnected rooms, some of which contain deadly traps.  All the characters have to do to escape is avoid the traps, work out the structure of the cube and try to get on with each other.  Unfortunately, it's the latter that proves hardest, as the movie decides to illustrate Sartre's dictum that hell is other people.  The movie has several scenes of almost unbearable tension - I was wincing and hiding my face when the characters faced a room which they could only pass through if they remained silent. There are also a couple of startling, gory scenes early on.  The film's twists are always well thought out, and the scenes containing the group slugging it out with their emotional problems are devastating.  The problem, however, is that some of the characters seem a little pat - they become stereotypes, and the acting is rarely good enough to hide the stilted characterization.  That said, if you like mathematical puzzles, or you just like a movie that has ideas and is prepared to follow them through, you should check this one out.

An incredibly simple plot, filmed in one room, with a tiny cast of relative unknowns, yet it works extremely well, on the power of the script and some outstaning performances, particuarly from Maurice Dean Wint, as 'Quentin.' It is difficult to explain more without spoiling anything but I recommend this film very highly as it has some great ideas and the dialogue is superb. It's biting criticism of our society are extremely powerful, and the film itself is remarkably intense.

We get to see how different people with different personalities and driving forces react in a situation they all find themselves mysteriously stuck in. On this level this movie works brilliantly. Although for my money the performance of the idiot savant was overbearing and nearly always bordering on too much the rest of the cast were great. Sure some of the plot devices (such as them miraculously being able to decipher the meaning of the numbers in the cube) border on the ""Yeah right what utter crap"" side of movie cliches and suspension of reality, but if you can look past these small flaws and actually think (yes I realize that watching a movie and thinking are at odds with the mindset required for viewing the majority of big budget hollywood blockbusters) about the story and the way it is handled then this is a movie which WILL have much much more of an effect on the way you view many things than any ""100 minutes of light entertainment"" movie ever will. Overall Great plot, good acting. At no stage did I ever have the slightest feeling that I'd be better off spending my time doing something else. Unfortunately has a few flaws and minor annoyances which let it down. 8 stars out of 10.",Cube
397,ziquemu,"Whatever your station in life, your time is way too valuable for this movie ...",1,5 February 2002,"... you will never be able to get those ninety minutes back. Run.  Walk. Play in a park.  Do laundry.  Hug somebody.  Write a letter.  Clean out that messy drawer.  Do the crossword.  Surf the internet.  Just don't watch this movie.  I'm serious.Now, before the hordes of angry adolescents with Jessica Alba posters start coming after me (with the larger, more thoughtful general sci-fi set not far behind), let me say ... the IDEA of this movie is interesting.
Essentially a takeoff on the disaster/Poseidon Adventure setup, where a bunch of diverse people who wouldn't normally hang out together are forced to get along in order to solve a big problem -- e.g., their survival -- I thought it wouldn't be half bad.  And it's not, initially.  But as this thing plods on, with some really poor acting performances, it really vacillates between two poles: ""Oh, yeah, we've been dropped in a cube ... a giant series of cubes, actually, and we're probably going to die ... hey, how do we open that door?  Hmm, that's a nice shirt/pant combo he has ..."" and ""OMIGODOMIGODOMIGOD we're going to die! Die! DIEDIEDIE!!!!""I've never been trapped in a cube, so this may be normal behavior.  But it's a little tired from an acting standpoint.So ... acting fair to middlin', at best.  But what really gets me is you watch this whole stupid affair, only to find out ... nothing.  Zip, nada, nothing.  It just ends.Now perhaps I'm accustomed to films and not self-indulgent class projects. But a little more than ""hey, the savant'll save 'em"" might be nice.  I'm not asking for the whole backstory -- I watch X-Files, etc., and understand the fun of keeping stuff from the audience.  But this is the sci-fi equivalent of one of those French films, where she might date him, and might not, and we don't know, and there's a lot of talking, and ... hey, it just ended. For those not into this sort of thing, it will leave you very unsatisfied. Trust me.However, kudos to the filmakers.  This had to be the cheapest set in movie history -- two adjoining cubes that light up different colors.",Cube

My brother rented this movie without any knowledge about it or what it was even about. Needless to say we were all sceptical, however we gave it a chance. Now i dont know what our faces looked like afterwards but i know we were flabbergastered ( possible misspelled ). This movie was great! I mean all the actors did a fine job and the director certainly was good however it wasnt those things which made this movie what it is. It is a rare thing seen in contemporary hollywood its called a script, and trust me Cube had a great one. From the very beginning to the very end this movie left endless questions for the viewers to constantly ponder. ( POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! ) I mean how did they get on the cube? What was it for ? What was Kazzams deal? What happened at the end to Kazzam? Now i can understand how the fact that the end of this movie brings up more questions then answers can frustrate. But it was this fact that i loved about the movie, you had no idea what was gonna happen next. However you truly must watch this movie sevral times, each time you pick up on something you didnt notice or see the previous time. This movie is truly great and your looking for something that is original then this is most definatley your movie. However if you dont like movie that answer nothing, seem cheap, and dont follow ""hollywood standards"". This movie merits an 8/10.""No more talking. No more guessing.

403,Alemme01,Pretty good mind-bending movie,7,24 March 2013,"I recently watched Cube a second time, and was not as blown away as I was the first time I saw it.First off, I couldn't help but notice the TV movie style of the film. The lower quality, mediocre acting, and forgettable dialogue all kind of brought it down for me. However, it does kind of work, because it's about as thought-provoking a made-for-TV movie could possibly get.In terms of characters, none are too memorable. They are at least passable, but the mostly non-memorable dialogue makes them forgettable. And in the end, none are too likable. Although, that is the point.The story was a lot cooler when I first saw it, but on second inspection, it could easily be a Twilight Zone episode. Pretty much, it's about strangers that wake up in a cube. They find other cubes next to it, and they figure out ways of going from cube to cube by reading numbers and going past traps. And it turns out, it's all apart of some big cube that was built by a bunch of people who didn't know what the hell they were doing.And the concept of having strangers wake up in a room? I don't know, but it seems like it's been done before, and therefore making the message a little more obvious. The message, of course, is ""humans will turn into savages in morbid situations,"" which has been a somewhat common message ever since Heart Of Darkness and Lord Of The Flies, and probably even before then. Another message, which is slightly less obvious, is ""only the innocent are good."" In this case, it's someone with the mind of a child. (AKA a retard.) As he is the only person to walk into the white light, and get out alive. What could the white light symbolize? Why, heaven, of course! Seems familiar? Same here. That's probably because it's been done before.Although it may seem like I don't like it, I do. It's still an interesting tale, with a message that at least slightly gets me to think. However, it is good when judged by the standards of a TV movie. If you are gonna compare it to some of the great mind-bending movies like The Matrix or 2001: A Space Odyssey, you're gonna get left cold.Overall, a good watch.",Cube

405,david_blakemore,Excellent movie,10,29 February 2004,"One question that has stuck in my mind since I 1st saw this film, and that is what would the reaction be if this was a Hollywood blockbuster with a couple of A/B stars and an average director or maybe even a top quality director like Fincher or Scorsese?I really enjoyed the film and thought it was interesting that we never find out who built the cube and why. Maybe this is for the better but it would highly likely that if this was a Hollywood film then we would find out.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a bit of sci-fi and a thriller, this is a superb film which reveals humans at their worst, but mind you thats the name of the game, testing morals while trying to escape something no one knows",Cube

There is just so much to enjoy about the film and it's 'hidden content' if you know your films. Top notch acting especially under such difficult circumstances, a simple but utterly compelling plot, very sound direction and overall first class on any budget. Some important moments in the film's beginning include the discussion about any of them knowing how they got there (crucial as it leads the way to the only plausible ending), as well as Quentin's comment which enlightens all that they have been given the means to escape with the skills each character has (Holloway being a Doctor etc). In other words 'they' (whoever they are?) have played fair but of course no amount of booby traps in a concealed space with time running out, highlighted early on by comments made by firstly Rennes and then Holloway, can prevent mankind's real enemy succeeding in it's demise and that is mankind itself. The longer the movie goes the more desperate the characters become intensified by the cop, Quentin. This film will become a classic in a few years to come simply because it has to. Important, Intelligent, Intense, Intriguing, Gripping. This is a film that needs to be seen with the mind.

The acting can be inconsistent, the dialogue occasionally stilted and the SFX somewhat representative of it's evidently low budget. It is also undoubtedly one of the best Science fiction films of the 90's as well as being one of the most impressive directorial debuts in cinema. This low budget gem has more intelligence, originality and invention than 95 per cent of the Science Fiction regularly churned out by Hollywood studios with a 100 times the budget at their disposal.

It could have been a really, really good film but the execution just wasn't there. The acting was laughably bad, the dialogue was horrid and the characters were all stock and two-dimensional. It was almost as if the film makers felt that the idea was enough, that the actual movie could ride on the coat tails of the story. Well, no. You actually have to go forth and create something as good as the idea you originally came up with. Some of the metaphors are really beat over your head, too. By the end of the movie, I had given up all hope on being entertained and was just curious as to how they were going to end this mess and then a series of movie cliches broke out. Surprise, surprise. With a much better script and real actors, this movie would have been something cool. As is, it just steals 90 minutes of your life. It would have felt much more satisfying if they had just relayed the premise of the film and ended it at a running time of 5 minutes.

It wants to be a psychological study masquerading as a thriller, but it fails on both counts.  As a thriller, it's far too predictable (did anyone watching this, when the mentally handicapped boy very first showed up, not think that he would end up having math skills that would help save the day?  Talk about a cliched ""twist""!), and as a psych study, it does nothing but establish cliched types that are moved around like chess pieces by a beginning player.

413,Coyote-37,Cinema without the clutter,8,6 December 2000,"A beautiful exercise in cinematic restraints, both unavoidable (The film has a surprisingly low budget) and deliberate (The director famously chose to shoot using only one set). Cube is wonderfully refreshing for both sci-fi and cinema fans alike. Like 'The Blair Witch Project', much of the pleasure of 'Cube' derives from it's undeniable originality, meaning it can be appreciated whether or not you enjoy the film on a personal level.The simplisity of the film is hard to comprehend without actually viewing it. There is one set (Perhaps the films strongest character, seen as the 'villain'), a tiny cast of characters who each have a very specific role to play within the plot structure, and a wafer thin storyline (Six people wake up in a giant maze and attempt to escape, and that's it). There is no true explanation of the Cubes purpose, various theories are suggested by the prisoners, but each is fundamentally flawed. It simply exists to give us an hour and a half of nerve tingling drama, as we quickly realise that the details don't matter, it is simply a study of a group of people in peril and the friction and comradeship that develops therein.Despite the aforementioned budgetry constraints, the movie contains some amazing visuals, notably the spinning wire trap that the policeman nearly gets caught in, and of course, the jaw dropping opening, where we are introduced to the cube as an unnamed prisoner gets suddenly and spectacularly 'cubed'.Like the rooms of the cube itself, this is a sparsely decorated, sometimes frightening, but always ingeniously designed piece of science-fiction cinema.

This film is enjoyable because it doesn't come up with distracting effects and meanwhile starts to pull you into the cube trying to figure the system for yourself.All in all, I had fun watching this movie until the end which was a little strange and didn't fit into my ideas.8/10",Cube

The concept itself, total strangers waking up on the floor of a 14 ft square cube, surrounded by deadly traps and with no idea what to do, bodes well. The problem is that it soon becomes clear that all of the characters are deadly dull and formulaic, and that we're not actually gonna see many rolling heads. Worth a mention is the doctor (I forget her name) who, whether by design or appaling scripting, is one of the most annoying characters in any movie, ever.The way they circumvent the traps too (I won't give it away here) is totally random, it's like the writer had no idea how to do it, so went back to school textbooks to try and come up with something vaguely scientific. The problem is that when they're having arguments over it, it just sounds stupid and contrived.Personally, I'd have rather see a few more intricate traps rather than the moderately poor collection that we get to see, a few more deaths (although obviously that'd involve paying more actors).Worth a watch due to the strength of concept and pure sci-fi-ness of it all, but could have been so, so much better.",Cube

A satisfactory reason for the characters predicament is never given and the end of the film leaves one thinking, ""What the...?"" and not in a good way.In conclusion, worth checking out if you're a sci-fi fan, but otherwise, not much here to see.Rating = 6/10",Cube

It is ridiculously good considering it was made for only $750,000 (Cdn.). This is high concept at its best. Not to mention making a low budget indie film look as good as a Hollywood film (even the special effects). The power of this film is what you don't yet know. It slaps you in the face and ties you to the edge of your seat. It does a brilliant job of making the audience feel like they are with the characters. This movie beat ""Shakespeare in Love"" at the Box Office in France, and dominated ""The Truman Show"" in Japan. Too bad it was overlooked in the U.S., and inadequately promoted in its home country of Canada. The Canadian film industry will never make a dent in the ever invading American industry if it ignores its own great, clever films like Cube. Highly recommended.

As a viewer of the film you do not know anything more than the characters do, as they progress through the deadly traps and hopefully earn some understanding of the mystery. Somehow these individuals were not chosen by random to enter the maze, in some way they each carry one piece of the puzzle, all they have to find out is just what these pieces are and how to use them.I thought this film created a pretty real sense of fear all the way through. It gives your mind a little spin. That said it is far from perfect. I believe the idea is very interesting, but it could have been even better executed with better actors and a bigger budget.

There are few movies that scratch that particular nightmare/sci-fi/thriller/mystery itch the way Cube does.Reactions can be mixed. The movie makes a couple of poignant statements about human nature. It also doesn't explicitly answer all the questions presented. If viewers like or don't like these decisions, it seems to make or break the movie for them. Speaking for myself, I found Cube's mystery-to-payoff ratio extremely satisfying.

And therein lies the simple chilling mindset of the movie. You awaken in an unknown world with several other people using each of your skills and knowledge to survive. The cubes the characters travel through offer no answers to why they are there, no solace in their quest to survive. The movie had me picking sides with characters from the get go and showed the breakdown of the human mind under such conditions. But all this added up to what? Nothing and that's it. The ending is non-existent. There is no final explanation or grand scheme to it all, the movie jus stops from story telling and quits.

Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting thriller/character study falls victim to pretentiousness and a poor script. As far as pretensions are concerned, it is obvious that the film's creators intended it to convey some sort of message about the evils of the military-industrial complex, or perhaps comment upon Man's primal nature. Although these issues are sometimes touched upon, like the film itself, they are never explored to a meaningful extent. Further impairing the movie is its sub-par script. It is clear, at a very early stage, what will happen: at least one character will go insane and kill someone. The survivors will then have to contend with this character and the Cube itself while trying to escape. While the story moves toward this inevitable stage, it throws in several superficial conflicts for good measure. Most implausible among these is the animosity between Quentin and Worth. No reason is given for these characters' mutual hatred for one another. Rather, we are forced to accept their vitriolic banter as the result of confined, incompatible personalities.

For anyone who knows their low primes (up to 31), and can multiply, will find some of the mathematical assertions ridiculous - for example, that no-one alive could factorise a 3-digit number in their head (quite an easy simple task). The set is pretty, the actors (and dialogue) aren't that important, and you really get to cheer when a character you've taken a dislike to bites the dust.

429,thepigsoftheroundtable,Chilled me to the core,9,7 October 2015,"Not since I watched The Shining have I seen such a great movie about the human mind descending into madness. Cube opens with six people trapped in a cube shaped room with doors on every side. Everyone in the room is different there are no similarities between them. One is a doctor, another a police officer, one a math student in college, one a guy who just is, a mentally handicapped man, and an escape artist. Together they must uncover the mystery of where they are and what they are doing there. But it gets worse as they discover that some rooms are booby trapped and others aren't. The whole premise for the movie is simple and that is what I think makes it such a spine tingling movie. The characters and the audience don't know anything about what is going on, creating a never ending feeling of unease. The acting in this movie was amazing, and I really felt like I was part of the group in the cubes. I tensed up at the most tense scenes, I was horrified by the traps, and when the police officer went crazy I felt the fear of Leaven and Worth as he chased them through the cubes. But it's not just simplicity and the acting that make this movie scary, it's the deep look into the human mind and how it deals with terrifying situations. It was interesting to see the whole spectrum of how humanity deals with possible death spread out over all these characters. One other thing I liked is the ending it fit perfectly with the whole movie there was no tearful reuniting with family members or staring at the sun in amazement. Instead there is the last guy you would ever expect to get through the whole maze walking off into a bright light. There is no hint of what is beyond the cube, a mystery movie that ends with a mystery, perfect. Cube was a fantastic look into the mind of humanity and how long it can last. It may be one of the scariest thrillers I've ever seen even without an antagonist. So I give it 9/10.",Cube

Pointless arguing is a true result of high stress, however it doesn't make for an engaging movie.We are never answered why. If you've seen any of these minimalist psychological movies, you'll understand. Very few answer any protagonist questions. This it is an endeavor into peoples behavior when they are stressed to the point of breaking. It's done well enough to be entertaining, but satisfies as much as a rice cake.",Cube
431,thegonedeadtrain,Interesting idea.,6,5 January 2006,"This had an interesting idea. 7 people awaken in a cube, with no idea how they got there, or even (at first) where they are. They find each other, and work together to solve the puzzle. Furthermore, each one has a specific ability, making themselves necessary for the team.While this is a great idea, some of the dialogue is a little bit out there. There's a bit of dark humour to it, and it seems like the ""math expert"" is but a novice. Her prime number debacle is included in the quotes.Despite this, the element of teamwork makes this a movie to watch at least once. There are definitely a few twists (naturally - it's a pun for those who've seen it), and is basically an entry-level movie into the world of good sci-fi movies.",Cube
432,daddyabc,Excellent!!,10,11 December 2005,Why movies like this don't get the acclaim they deserve is indicative of the stranglehold Hollywood has on modern movies and until we start to see other studios and directors with less money getting the credit they deserve movies like this will continue to be gems that only the die hard movie fans will discover.The movie is made on the cast performance and though there are a lot of special effects they are of the believable kind.This is what I call acting and though the scifi storyline may not be to everyones taste it'll have you on the edge of your seat. Notable characters are Stargate Atlantis's David Hewlett(Dr Rodney Mckay) and Nicole de Boer (Ezri Dax from DS9 and The Dead Zone),Cube

The whole figuring out the solutions part is from thin air without path of logic, and the girl is a supercomputer.Nowadays better movies exist in this genre.",Cube
434,Chrissy-4,Amazing what can be done on a low budget,8,29 September 1998,"This film begins as it goes on  gruesomely. A man wakes up in a strange room in the shape of a cube. There are doors on each of the six sides which lead to other cube-shaped chambers. He enters one of these rooms and something very nasty happens to him. Various other characters then turn up in this maze of booby-trapped cubes and the plot centres on their attempts to escape.Cube is a long way from being a perfect film. It is plagued by the kind of melodramatic over-acting that would be more at home in the theatre and by some very portentous dialogue. And the concept of throwing a bunch of people into a confined and dangerous position and seeing how they react is hardly the most original of ideas. On the other hand I found this an impressively disturbing, intense and generally intelligent film. The low budget was probably a godsend as it restricted most of the action to one set giving the film a very claustrophobic atmosphere, and also limiting the amount of distracting special effects.The combination of characters in Cube might seem contrived  we have a bullying cop, a compassionate doctor, a nihilistic `office worker', a geeky (but not too-geeky) maths student, an escaped escape-artist and an autistic man who, guess what, turns out to have amazing abilities that come in handy later on. While these characters are generally portrayed as stereotypes, the plot strongly suggests that there is more at work than a writer's wilful throwing together of a neat cross-section of society. Each character has skills or knowledge which could contribute towards the effort of escaping from the cube, and this sets up the central problem of the film. To escape they must work as a team, but the horror of their situation where a wrong move results in a highly unpleasant death, so alienates them from each other that they eventually become as much their own enemies as the monolithic cube in which they are trapped. Cube is clearly not a fan of the theory that people pull together in pressurised situations.For me the fact that no final explanation was given for the existence of the cube or the presence of the people within it was a definite plus point  there are already far too many films in which (unlike reality) all the ends are neatly tied up. The possibility that it is all part of a government conspiracy is raised by one of the characters and thankfully dismissed. The idea of government conspiracies being behind everything has long ago ceased to be subversive and thought-provoking and has now entered the realm of banal cliché. The notion that someone out there knows what's going on and can be held responsible for events is, like most other vaguely comforting ideas, absent from this film. The question of what lies outside the cube remains as disturbingly unresolved as the question of what is going on inside.",Cube
435,MovieInYourFace,What a wonderful analogy of life...,8,3 April 1999,"When I watch a movie for the first time, I take it for face value.  This movie is unbelievably suspensful and very intellectual... not just a gore movie.  The movie itself is enough to make me want to own it.  After seeing it I thought about it more.  Other comments on the movie stated that parts of the movie were unclear and that the vague ending left a ""bad taste in [their] mouth"", but I think there was more to it than that.  I could be completely wrong, but I interpreted the cube that they were trapped in was actually life as we know it.  The different rooms represent the different paths we take in life.  The final room is a bright white seemingly infinite place... hmmm, I wonder what that could represent?  I believe that the director left the movie semi-vague so that we as observers would notice this hidden meaning.  The next time you see Cube, check for the subtle things.",Cube

After the movie finished I stared at the screen for a while (it must have been an dull portrait) not knowing what to do next. A stupid plot, unnecessary cruelty and no answers in the end. I could not believe that grown-up people could make such a movie. What is all this relating stuff about KAFKA ? Kafka is a highly admired philosopher,German like me, and people say he was insane in his last days. There is absolutely nothing that reminds me of Kafke when I watch this movie (besides the fact, that Kafka was insane). I'm sorry, maybe I 'm still too confused to explain what I felt.

Still, at some point you just have to buy into the fact that it's a movie.So the thing i liked best about this movie was the same thing that made a lot of people seemingly hate it. The ending? How can you not love it? While i hear people griping and saying that the ending was forced and stupid but i loved it because it leaves us wondering. Who is doing this? why are they doing it? where is it taking place? did Kazan get out? I think it makes it that much more creepy to think about, because answers would just give us ways to comfort ourselves and give ourselves excuses not to be afraid.Anyways i would like to offer an alternative ending in which worth, leaven and Kazan get out without Quentin coming back but when they step outside they find themselves in a gigantic complex made up of the seemingly gigantic cube they just got out of.

443,bumfrombrooklyn1,Ridiculous,1,16 May 2008,"A friend told me to see this on a recommendation of 'this is waaaayyy better than Dark City!' and I, being the sap I am, took him up on it and rented it. How this film spawned two sequels is beyond me, but should be a great encouragement to anybody trying to get into the industry. Apparently the only requirement nowadays to be a film director is a penchant for violence, access to a camera and some people pretending to act in front of it. Now I can't say that this is a regular 'B' movie, and because it tries so hard to not be one it falls even harder. I suppose the 'actors' did what they could with the material and the maddening set they had to work in, but in a situation like this I indict all parties: The writers, director, cinematographer, set designer all had a collective malfunction while plotting this film. The only aspect I could give credit to is the CGI work, which is used sparingly and effectively, though in no way altered the tremendous heaviness I felt when this movie ended. You are faced with despicable or weak characters who are all just one step out of film school, and who develop and play off each other irrationally and pointlessly. The claustrophobic feeling I extracted was not intended; instead of feeling trapped and fearful for the characters lives, I felt trapped with them and wanted their lives to end quickly so the movie would be over. I just hated this movie because it hated itself.",Cube

The ending was the poorest out of the whole movie, everything else was great. The acting was perfect for the film, David Hewlett did a great job, but it was different from everything i'd seen do so far, which is pretty much just Stargate Atlantis, so seeing him be so surreal and not that scientific or Rodney Mckayish was really cool. The idea of this cube with lots of little cubes inside, some with death traps, some with nothing at all, six different kind s of people inside, i thought was just original, and made sense too. Quentin was a really twisted character, at first he seems like the strong, hero-type, brave cop that everyone likes, but towards the end his true side comes clear, that he isn't the good guy, but more the bad guy, and the type of person everybody hates, i almost cheered when he died.

But now I'm older and I rented this movie, and watched the whole thing, I loved every minute of it, it makes you feel paranoid and claustrophobic, but the story is great too.*SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH!!!!!!*So, basically 6 people of different corners of life wake up in a weird looking cube, who go through what they remember, who they are, and what they do. There is a math-whiz, an escape artist, a doctor, a guy who ""BARELY"" designed the exterior, a big cop, a mentally handicapped man that will later be the big help. Let's say, the guy who thinks he's ""ALL-THAT"" gets killed first They go through rooms at one point thinking about prime numbers is not-trapped, then they will be proved wrong, and they somehow die not by the traps, but by the members of the group going crazy and killing each other in a way. Near the end, only 1 man makes it out, and that scene will have you wondering for a very long time.If you're hoping for a non-stop gore-fest, don't get this.

The fact that i saw it only in 2017, amazes me as i'm a movie-buff and this genre is a favorite of mine. The movie is well directed, choreographed and acting is, fun to watch. There is good music going for the movie. Its a tense sci-fi drama of human emotions which is central to this movie. The mental strain to the characters is worse than their physical.

I bought it, went home and watched it and when it ended I was still thrilled. This was something so different. All the things that happen are kind of set in the same space.As good as this film is, it's also a little disturbing. It's also like a lesson of what people are like and what happens to certain people in this sort of frightening situations.

458,2782,Why can't we make horror movies like this in the States?,9,11 December 2002,"This is one horror movie that stands alone as probably the best horror movie i've seen made in the last 15 years. Ironically, I first heard about it through the director's commentary for the Resident Evil DVD (pretty dumb movie). What surprises me more is that this movie is Canadian. Canadians can make horror movies? Apparently they can. What sets this movie apart from American horror movies is character development. And by that, I mean the characters ACTUALLY develop. Watching Resident Evil or I Know What you did Last Summer, I realize we never find out anything interesting about the characters. But I was ok with that, as the characters in those movies are wholly uninteresting. Cube is different. There are no real heroes. All the characters have good and bad qualities. They succeed and they fail. Some live, some die. The movie doesn't feel the need to keep the plot moving by killing someone off in a really gross way every 5 minutes. The first scene alone is gruesome enough to hold us the whole movie. Also, worth noting is the great score to the movie. And by great, I dont mean fantastic musical numbers. The score is very subtle yet very creepy. Just creaks and quiet rumbles and singular notes held for great lengths.

Not full of the sort of didactic crap that poses as science fiction these days, Cube is an allegory in every way. Back before science fiction was all about moralizing or political debates cheaply disguised as ""future settings"", projects like cube could be made that simply offer a concept.  With the seven characters trapped inside a cube, trying to unlock the mystery of why they are there and how to get out, I was suddenly aware of how allegorical the whole story was, the whole point of solving a puzzle working on two levels (the scientific puzzle and the human puzzle). The characters had simple names and functions, reminding me of the characters in Stalker (writer, scientist, stalker).

But to rent it on 99-cent Tuesday made it a real find, a movie that sticks with you exactly because it doesn't try to explain itself.Various characters find themselves in a cubic room with doors in each of the six walls, each of which leads to another cubic room, some of which contain deadly traps (razor wire, acid spray, flame throwers, etc.)A group of five struggles to find a way out before tension and suspicion do them in. They don't know who put them in the cube, really, or why, and neither do we; we're left to ponder the meaning. This is a real B-movie, done cheap (just one set!) with no-name actors, but the FX are good, the gore is tasteful, and the lingering paranoia is good enough for me to give this a genre-grade 7.

The suspense was very tight, but I found the rest of the elements lacking. The characters (except for Rennes, who died too quickly) were flat, and the plotting became predictable after a while. I also found the reason for why the people were there to be weak (the cube exists to be used? Isn't that tautological?). I did like the idea that as a long-term project changes hands, it tends to have details lost in the shuffle. When it concerns human lives, that is a frightening thought.My friend told me about how they made this movie on a low budget mostly because they had special effects donated by two companies. And he showed me some commentary (this was on DVD) on how the film was made. What's sad is that I found the process of making the movie more fascinating than the movie itself.Oh well.

Symbolically, it's easy to see that, in some way, the film is portraying us, the world, the technocracy that humans have unwittingly created for themselves.  The entire film takes place inside an artificial environment, out of control and functioning with mathematical precision.  No other film in the 1990's - the decade which saw science fiction become respectable - gives us such a simple yet colourful snapshot of contemporary technocratic life and fears.  Budget-wise it's in the same league as _The Blair Witch Project_ (i.e. under $2 million), made on a shoestring, with donated special effects and a home grown cast, snagging a Sundance award, and grossing relatively scads of money.  There aren't any explosions in it, or bullets; the pathos works, it's respectful of blood, and it looks pretty.  It feels like a sci-fi version of those ""Canadian Heritage"" shorts in between tv commercials.  ""...and first built in 1997, it's been running ever since.  The C.U.B.E.: A part of our heritage"".

There were no famous actors in it and for this fact it appealed to me.  A group of people wake up with no knowledge of how they got into this square room.  From there, they try to figure out how to escape and try to piece together the whole reason behind being trapped in this cube.  The Audience is just as baffled and because of this, the audience is filled with the same sense of despair as it seems there is no way to get out.  This story leads to great discussion on the who, what and why.  Nothing can fully explain this story as it is one title one must see for themselves.

Overall it's not a very well written movie. Production value is relatively high considering the budget but the musical score is not particularly impressive and I also feel that the cinematography could have been more effective. Overall Cube is a good example of a film left hanging on a high concept plot with nothing much else to offer.

Apart from that none of the points in the movie or even the casts stand out. Most of the times it seems they are pushing it too hard which leads to awkward expressions and, sorry to say this but 'over acting'.Direction is good, apart from the occasional close up shots which because of the my previous point 'over ....' doesn't help.The only two casts who were convincing I will say was David Hewlett (as Worth) and Nicole de Boer (as Leaven). Quentin and Holloway fail to impress, and I am sorry to say that Maurice Dean Wint i.e Quentin is one of the reasons I thought this movie was a waste of my time. Either he had been pushed too hard to look scary or for some reason he did it himself.Bottom line, great idea for a thriller there are a few loopholes but those are acceptable.

473,hachehache-1,Unbelievable: You just don't buy it,3,13 September 2009,"O.k so. looking around in the comments, I had a hard time both finding a good review on how bad this film is and also coping with the idea that SO many people find it mind blowing.Basically, the idea is one more of those enigmatic thrillers about strangers appearing out of the blue in the middle of somewhere and trying to find out where? why? who? and how... I know this was done in 1997, and back than (I think) the concept wasn't so burn out, but either way, a good idea doesn't necessarily guarantee a good movie.So for starters we HAVE to trash the acting, specially of the two characters who ""shine"" the most: Quentitn (Sycho Cop) and the doctor which name I just forgot and don't care to remember. They REALLY don't no crap about interpreting a fictional character, it seems that, to them, acting mean being as melodramatic and loud as you can.But in general, all the actors and actresses in the movie sucked big time. But thats not the worst part, actually what makes it even worse is the senseless character development: One minute I'm scared and almost numb, the next I'm a real bad ass and I ROCK. One minute I'm an idiot and, as if it wasn't very predictable, I'm a genius. Really, nothing justifies one thing or the other, there are no leading steps towards the next point, it all just happens, the characters ¡just do what they have to do in order to make the movie go on, despite the lack of logic in there Acts or thoughts.Another real problem is the dialog, just plain stupid, cliché, stereotyped and really not justified.It seems that one of the main problems within the script is the fact the the writers forgot to consider that it's in hard moments when the best of us comes out, and even if it doesn't, it wont justify the overall craziness just because... Things must be logic within the world that is being presented to the viewer, and CUBE really does a BAD work in accomplishing that.",Cube
474,Metal_Hammer,You'll love this one!!!!,9,22 February 2003,"This is a big, awesome, great movie. It's original and disturbing. It gives you a perspective of how relations evolve in a closed space like for example...a cube. The concept of this movie is also very original. 6 people were put in a gigantic cube with lots of rooms, some of those booby trapped, and they have to escape. They don's know how they got there, they don't know why they got there, basically the only thing they know it's that they need to get out of there because they have no food nor water and in a few days will die. A great movie about relationships without the feeling of ""deja-vu"". Sometimes you need to see a film that is simple in all its aspects. Has no complex plot or sudden turn-overs to the story, sometimes you just want to se a movie. More simple than 6 ordinary persons and a closed set it's difficult, but this one is very very good.",Cube
475,slartibartfastest,This cube doesn't have all three dimensions.,4,24 February 2005,"If you like psychological thrillers, you should see this movie. It's quite enjoyable and even - dare I say - thought provoking. Most importantly, it serves as an interesting experiment in group dynamics. If you're a psychologist or interested in the field, you'll probably want to see this one.So why only five of ten stars? While worth a viewing, Cube is a heavily, heavily flawed piece of film-making. Visually, Cube is better than average. Sets, lighting, and effects are all impressive when budget is considered. Camera framing/placement/etc is all adequate, although rarely - if ever - artistic. So what's wrong with Cube? Everything else.The acting is hit or miss, with lots of misses and hits that stay in the infield, there're no 'homers' here. Wayne Robson, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller all get a B- for perfectly serviceable acting (you can suspend disbelief and forget they're actors); the other half of the primary cast is either bad or really bad.Worse than (and partly to blame for) the acting, is the film's script, which is at one time or another incoherent, clumsy, unintentionally funny, or indicative of the writer's below average talent for math (the film's math major ponders for several seconds over whether an even number is prime or not). I'd give the writer props for an original and unique concept, but it isn't really - it just hasn't been completely saturated with movie iterations like most other ideas. Jim Henson did something similar with The Cube (1969), and I've seen more than one version of the same concept on various Sci-Fi shows made before this film.Because of its script and acting issues, the story as a whole falls flat on its face. The who, why and what are never really answered, nor could they be intelligently with the mess of information the shoddy script gives you.Ultimately, Cube is worth watching because of the social and philosophical issues it raises, but leaves it up to you to deal with those questions intelligently - because this movie doesn't.",Cube

It's just a pathetic communistic attempt to imitate real sci-fi stories written by Isaac Asimov or Ray Bradbury.

477,oscar-egb-93,It has something to say...,7,4 June 2014,"To start off, ""Cube"" is a really original movie in which my only comparison can be to the games of the film ""Saw"". I think Vincenzo Natali did an excellent job in creating a unique plot. However, the acting was not good at all. Especially from Maurice Dean Wint. They should have done a better job in casting the villain because he can be considered the main character in the film.The film never resolves. It does not have an ending in which you can sigh of relief and go on with your life. In fact, it does the exact opposite. After viewing, it leaves you wanting more to which you can only depend on your own imagination to fill the void it left behind. The machinery of the cube can be compared to life itself. You can't know if someone out there is watching, or if something put you on Earth for a reason. You can't possibly imagine if there's a master plan for us all as to why we're here. The film teaches us a lesson. At first glance you see a mentally handicapped man like Kazan and think nothing of him, but who knows, he might surprise you and maybe be your savior. Live life to its fullest, never give up and always look for an outcome. The movie was entertaining with a good story and something to say.With that said, I give the film a solid 7/10.",Cube

480,KingAwesome,An Indie Flick for Rod Serling Geeks,6,27 November 2005,"Cube is what Saw would have been if it took place in a series of interconnected, incrementally rotating cubes and tried a little too hard to be The Twilight Zone. This film had an interesting idea behind it and it pulled off many things very well, but there were points in this claustrophobic sci-fi thriller where the film's shortcomings were glaringly obvious.Now any film buff has to respect the indie cred of a director who shoots an entire movie in a 14'x14'x14' enclosure, and set design was definitely one of Cube's strong suits; the set was convincing and slick, plus the many multi-colored chambers (particularly the red ones) all elicited the desired effect from the audience, making effective cinematography a snap.However, one of the biggest problems with this movie was caused by the above limitations. In a film like this, back story is very important for character development, and when it comes to back story, it's ALWAYS better to ""show"" rather than tell. Flashbacks are much more effective than dialog in these kinds of instances, and it would have made more sense to ""show"" in this case, rather than having Doctor Holloway make extraordinarily accurate logic leaps on the characters of others throughout the film. As an aside, what kind of doctor was she supposed to be, anyway? Also, aside from Worth, whose character was superb, a fair portion of this film's dialog (particularly Quentin's) was laughable. My favorites were Holloway's ""GET OFF HIM YOU NAZI!"" and Quentin's vague, bizarre monologue about ""slipping {Leaven} in the lock."" The mathematics in this film were also extremely careless at many points, and from my experience with people who've seen this movie, that's a detail that either really bothers you or it doesn't at all.My biggest quarrel with this film was the total lack of any explanation at all to the plot. How did they get in the cube? Why were they put there? Where is the cube located? Who built it? Why? None of these questions were answered, and although that may be fine for many viewers, it wasn't for me. In the best sci-fi movies, the writers always do their best to make things at least sort of make logical sense, but no such luck here.All in all, it really depends what you look for in a movie. Cube was an above-average indie flick that remained entertaining in a cramped environment that would have grown tedious in the hands of many directors. It was effectively suspenseful and creepy, although the character studies and psychological elements largely fell short. If you're a fan of science fiction and suspense and you'll accept psychology that isn't quite Hitchcockian, then I recommend renting Cube, because you will enjoy. If none of the above are your thing or you're a nitpicky math person, avoid this one and rent Lifeboat instead.",Cube
481,flo_rin108,Refreshing,8,6 August 2016,"This movie is about a group of people trapped inside a gigantic cube, which also consists of thousands of cubic rooms, some of them with traps inside, each trap unique and efficient in slaughtering humans. Even if this kind of premise has been done to death already (Saw), Cube seemed refreshing to me. It's a very mysterious movie, the ending itself left open to the viewer's imagination, it's not really about the cube itself but about the relation between the characters and their capacity to overcome the human ego in order to solve the cubic maze. Can't really say that the human relations are what kept me interested, they're not bad but there's always that one cliché character that will make you roll your eyes, I was more fascinated about the cube itself, the reasons and ideas behind it, so yea, Cube will probably stir your imagination, later parts of the movie deepening you even further into mystery and interpretation.

Where? by who is the cube being run. In both movies there are 2 women & 4 men (not including Ash). In any case I think the movie THE CUBE is a very well done piece of Anthropologic science fiction. Everyone in the movie except for the retort was guilty of being ungrateful. They had exceptional talent but they all griped about how bad there lives are & meanwhile here is this wiz kid that is a space out retort. When all them are put to the test the retort won.

The acting is also straight out of high school.  Each of the characters has inexplicable obsessions.  Ideally, we'd know more about the history of the characters to make their reactions less strange.

The set design and the photography are wonderful, also.Did you think the story was predictable? well, I certainly didn't, and to me, the development of the simple premise (6 persons trapped inside a cube full of traps) was just excellent. There is one scene that must be one of the must stressful sequences I've ever seen. And even when some of the events in the movie could be considered as stereotypical, the final result is a brilliant story.In some way, Cube reminded me of The Blair Witch Project, since it also presents the relationship between people who are facing a huge danger, a strange and unknown environment. Both movies show us the emotional breakdown of the characters.But It's a shame that a film like ""Cube"" will never be a huge blockbuster hit.

I've seen many Canadian movies, most of them I didn't like, for one reason or another.I really loved this movie.The idea of being placed in a deadly maze, not knowing how you got there, forced to survive by your wits and by the wits of others is a terrifying one.  I found myself totally immersed in the idea of the Cube, not caring about the feasibility of the deathtrap, but really identifying with the characters, and placing myself alongside them in the terrible situation they've entered.I really liked the character interaction, I thought it was believable, given the circumstances, and I like the idea that the characters were chosen (by whomever confined them) because their skills would complement each other. The acting was very good, and I empathized with all of them.I thought the death scenes and traps were suitably disturbing, evoking more terror and furthering the feeling of hopelessness of being trapped inside the giant machine.  The traps gave me sort of a medieval meets sci-fi feeling, and the effects were great.The movie progressed fairly quickly, and the final escape sequence was well devised, except for the standard villain-back-to-wreak-more-havoc device. Other than that minor tidbit of disbelief, the movie ended well, and I found myself crying out for more.

Originally I thought it was this pointless horror film that had no message in it other than ""it takes place in a cube.""  And while it looked interesting, I passed it over.Now, after hearing that the Sci-fi channel made a sequel, I figured I should give this movie a chance.  And I'm glad I did.  While the acting may be a tad over the top every now and then, this is the kind of gung-ho, money is an object, radical statement driven piece that we haven't seen the like of since star wars (although I think this has a better message).  Made on a shoe string budget, with b actors, this movie still holds a lot of water. And although it has the characteristics of horror and sci-fi, it's not trying to be too much of anything.  It is what it is, a cube in a room that is a cube, with doors that are cubes with 6 people (one who dies early on) representing the six sides of the cube.  And it doesn't matter who built it or why, because there is no one person to blame.  They all are part of the cube for the same reason.  Each one of them is responsible in their own way.

This movie keeps you on edge trying to figure out what's going on and why. And by the end of the movie these questions aren't really answered.  I found myself not caring for any of the characters for the sole reason that I felt that at any moment they could die.  If I identified with them, then I might take that idea of dying personally.   This is the kind of movie that could give you nightmares.  Overall this is an amazing movie (which was very low budget) that everyone should see once in their lives.  Don't watch it alone...",Cube

Boring in the end,1,15 June 2008,"I know this is a cult classic and is supposed to be filled with deep meanings about mankind, but the dialogue and acting are so bad...in the end, I didn't know if it was supposed to be a comedy or what! It was just boring and I didn't care if they ever got out or all got killed. In fact, I was rooting for the Cube to end the stupidest acting I've ever seen.The characters are so wooden, so one-dimensional, it's maddening. And of course, you're never going to get any resolution on the story, because there really isn't much of a story.

The concept is great.If you ever want to see ""Cube Zero (2004)"" too, which I really recommend, then it is very important to notice the end of that film. The films are connected in a very surprising way.Forget about ""Cube 2"", which only introduces more more bizarre traps, but adds nothing further.I didn't really notice the lack of budget until I read about it on IMDb.

The setting is unique and it spreads on many levels, from the psychology of a trapped person to the structure of our society.Yet I find several flaws in it. I find hard to believe that: - a person can kill another person while there is no certainty that this murder will make that person survive - an engineer that worked for months on the outer shell has no clue about the cube itself. While working on the constraints the shell has to endure, he would have learned about the moving cells, their weight, their frequencies, etc. He would have learned the outside temperature, the humidity, etc. - someone can find a permutation among the gazillions of possible permutations in a cube composed of 14 thousand cells just by reading a handful of numbers; I believe it would only reduce the possible permutations to billions instead of billions of billions of billions, and would be impossible to compute for a human brain. - a person knowing that a room can be deadly will jump into that room so fast.

I think I would've preferred that one.Problems I had with Cube: 1. Quentin overall. His character. The crap he said. How he fell on his head and had enough strength to go find them. 2. They never said WHY everyone was there. There was never a connection made. They never answered the big questions: Who, what, when, where, why, how? 3. The people were too stupid to ask those questions too. For a few minutes, I thought they'd eventually realize that there had to be some connection but they didn't go very far. And when they did talk about who, it was so vague and sketchy- who wrote this crap? I could do better dialog. 4. AUTISTIC PEOPLE DON'T KNOW FACTORS. HOLY CRAP. Very few, VERY FEW autistic people actually have hidden 'powers', and when they do, it's usually something like being able to tell when a day is in a year to come or remember stuff. But someone as severely autistic as that guy would not be learning factors, or know them without being taught. He wouldn't have the capacity to understand that it's math. 5. The cube-number-factor-prime...whatever the hell was going on there, was never clearly explained. I really have no idea what it was all about. 6. UNNECESSARY DEATH. The math girl did not need to die. There was absolutely not reason. I could've seen Worth dying because Quenten was real mad at him but why the Math girl? It was just a nuisance. 7. So much blood!I'd rather see the remake, which apparently was just creepy, not gross.",Cube

With those characters no cube is needed; you put them in a deserted island (it would have been much better), or in a jail or in a convent or in any enclosure, and you will obtain the same chattering. So the cube is pointless and unessential to the content of the story.Or, otherwise, the cube is by itself meaningful (I don't see how), may be a parable of the universe and human struggle for understanding it's meaning, but then why not to put inside normal minds ? Or, may be, normal minds do not exist ?My advice: don't waste time, avoid this picture !",Cube
516,roberts-journalist,Just stupid,3,28 January 2013,"I've just watched Cube and I must say it was soooo bad. For several reasons, which I will try to explain in the following paragraphs. Just bear with me for a moment.First, the story. Well, there isn't much of a story, since the idea which the main theme of the film is centered on, takes you pretty much nowhere. The whole plot is, actually, a ""what if"" thing with no sense at all. There is a cube full of deadly traps, but no one knows who built it or at least why? There is no answer this questions. Vicenzo Natali and his team couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation for the cube's existence, so he dismissed the necessity of having one. That, my friends, is a huge lack in narrative seriousness.You are watching a bunch of irritating people while they try to escape from the cube before death finds them. And, just like in Final Destination, this would have worked okay, had the movie been honest and hadn't try to trick us all into thinking it's some sort of sci-fi masterpiece, by adding high-school algebra to the formula. Let me break it down for you: Cube isn't good science fiction, because it doesn't really add up to anything, and it's not silly entertainment, because it takes itself way too seriously.Moreover, the acting was terrible with capital ""t"". They (Maurice Dean Wint, Nicole de Boer, David Hewlett & others) make Ryan Phillipe look almost Oscar-worthy. So, any potential this movie might have had in the social field, - like human behavior and dark-side instincts in life threatening situations -, went sour because of the poor script and acting. The fact that the characters are all clichés (especially the classic black male antagonist and the math-genius autistic kid) didn't help either.",Cube

And are people ready to kill to save themselves? Fortunately at least two movies have been able to give thrilling and horrifying answers to these questions. Unfortunately 'Cube' is not one of them.'Cube' is an awful movie, totally ruined by the actors totally lack of talent. Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, is the worst of them, he doesn't deliver one single line with persuading acting.Unless you suffer from extreme claustrophobia you probably wont find this movie scary at all.

They have to escape.That's it? Certainly what I though when the film was introduced to me. Don't be fooled though, there is much more to CUBE than its concept would make you think.The focus in CUBE is not so much the story but the characters within it, how they interact and react to each other and what is going on around them. It explores how easily a person can 'turn' with the need to survive. CUBE is ultimately a look at human nature done in an interesting and wholly original way.Not that there isn't a good story as well, full of twists, revelations and tense moments, not to mention maths.The sets are imaginative (considering they only had one sound stage to film in and a limited budget). There are also great performances from all members of the small cast, while director Vincenzo Natali creates brilliant tension with his camera work, angles, and pacing.CUBE is probably not a film to everyone's taste, but it is certainly one that I would recommend to Sci Fi fans and / or psychological thriller fans alike, especially if you are looking for a relief from the action bred 'spoon feeding' that some films seem to provide these days.

The plot line was not bad but ruined by the characters and the finale seen. The only character I liked was killed in the last seen. And out of 7 (i think) people in the cube the only one to get out without dying is the mentally retarded man who has no idea whats going on.

Cube came out of this, but was unfortunately under-represented.Cube is an excellent view of the human element, more specifically how people react when placed in a stressful and life-threatening situation. For those who have not heard of this movie before may find this sounding familiar: The idea behind Saw.Vincenzo Natali created an excellent element of tension and mystery created simply in a 14' by 14' cube.

When we learned that each one of them had a role to play in the escape I was glad because I thought they were all linked to each other. And that link would've allow them to find the way out.

But that is the beauty of this film, that things don't have to BE explained. It doesn't matter why or how or whatfor. I personally hate being walked through films holding on to the director's hand. I would much rather think about what the film told ME. What I made from the events. There are so many hidden depths in this film that some of the reviews barely even touched on. The main one being philosophy - and the fact that each character represents a different aspect of it. Take Leaven who belongs to the Epistemology branch - the philosophy of knowledge. She reasons the cube as a mathematical puzzle and that by knowing the rules, they can get out. Each character attaches a different meaning to the cube and it in turn affects their relationship with it.If you didn't like this film, then go back to your Scream or I Know What You Did...

The only sounds we hear are those of the people talking, the sliding doors, and the electronic booby traps.Despite the thrill, the tension, and the heart pumping faster, the movie itself is satirical and quite upsetting.

SPOILER ALERT: Kazan is an autistic savant. This means that he's very, very, very good at math. Just letting everyone know that. ;) Not so much a spoiler as it is a hint.",Cube
546,let_them_eat_war21,Is this a comedy?,1,29 August 2006,"This move, Cube, is probably a candidate for the worst movie of the decade. Its story is intriguing enough, but it is horribly implemented. Nothing at all is explained, AT ALL. The dialogue is so rusty and idiotic. Here's a quote from the movie: ""This is an accident, a forgotten, perpetual public works project. You think anybody wants to ask questions? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck."". The previous quote was a answer to the general question: ""What is this Cube?"". Does that explain anything at all? The dialogue essentially makes all the characters, save one, Leaven, the math ""wiz"", seem mentally handicapped. Like they cannot even communicate on basic levels, and make any sense whatsoever. The ""shocking twist"" that leaves everyone in a stupor, is that, hold it, THE WAY OUT WAS IN THE ROOM THEY STARTED IN!!! Oh sweet Jesus, my heart medicine. Once again, I stress, it had a good idea, but the story, the acting, the characters, and the dialogue was just complete crap. I only recommend this movie if your in the mood to recreate a MST3K episode, or just plain laugh your ass off.",Cube

550,uglycuss,Cube is for the elite among us,10,13 December 2005,"Cube is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life. It isn't a classic Hollywood film, so if you haven't seen it, don't watch it with a lot of expectations based on mainstream movies because you WILL be disappointed. Cube should be watched with an open mind and with the knowledge that everything in it is there for a reason. Natali crafted every detail in Cube to say what he wanted it to say. what Cube is saying? No one knows even though a lot of people come up with theories. Natali has never revealed what exactly his intention was. i hear people say the acting isn't good, the script isn't realistic, whatever. the actors are awesome (especially Mr. Hewlett) and the script is an immaculate design, a map leading just where Natali wants it to. i don't think the script, the characters, the setting or the plot of Cube are supposed to be taken literally. Read this movie as you would a book or a painting or a sculpture or a poem. cult classic? absolutely. low budget? absolutely. obscure? in the US, yes it is. But WORTH EVERY SECOND of the ninety nine minutes it lasts? YEEEESSSS AND MORE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! so watch this movie.",Cube

552,simonchinnock,A repetitively drab film which is deliberately ambiguous to hide a poorly conceived story,3,16 September 2009,"This film sucked, it was not thought provoking. It was completely ambiguous and attempted to be incredibly abstract purely for the sake of it (or a misguided attempt to appear artistic). It did have a predictably dry script for a film which in essence should be carried by its dialogue given the limitations of the setting. The dialogue and inter-character conflicts became as repetitive as the 14x14 rooms the protagonists moved through. The acting was snooze-worthy B-movie amateur and the production values were only moderately better.This is a true and accurate summation of the value of the film. It won 3 stars from me because I have seen worse.I recommend avoiding it.",Cube

They never let you know what going on, how or why the people are in the cube, or why the cube exists.  Worst sets ever.  The entire film is filmed in one room that the change the color of the lights in.  The plot never develops, people just keep dieing for no reason.  The retard is the only one who survives, and to top it all off they only had to stay in the first room to escape.  This would have made the movie so much simpiler, and they could have moved on to something that mattered.  I would rather lay naked in the snow and let random passers by beat me in the forehead with a rusty crowbar than even see this film again.",Cube

The acting is bad at times, the writing is nothing special, the visual effects are... Well, not good, and the directing was alright. BUT, you just have to love this movie. It has a lot of flaws, but it works as a sci-fi horror/thriller. The film never drops the tension and terror. After the opening scene I don't think anyone could help but be intrigued. It is a brilliant idea for a story, even if it does borderline on silly occasionally. It's a film where you need to leave all sense of logic and judgement, and just have fun! Sit down on a Saturday night with some friends and enjoy it. You begin to feel the panic and claustrophobia that the victims are feeling. It really is scary! CUBE is an absorbing, terrifying little picture that is one of the best sci-fi/horror films I have seen since the ALIEN films.",Cube
555,ryanisameateater,Amazing!,9,6 August 2007,"I've only just watched Cube this week after hearing about it for years. I don't know why I waited so long as this movie is awesome! Everything about it just did it for me. The claustrophobic atmospheres, the tense acting, the twists and turns etc.Movies like Saw with it's scary mind tricks wouldn't exist if it weren't for Cube which was made way back in 1997. Saw 2 is in fact very similar, with a bunch of people finding themselves stuck in a labyrinth of tight dark places not knowing who and what to trust.I've watched this film twice now, and it is a great example of how amazing movies can be made for a low budget. If you have the idea to knock people out, then you make it happen within your means.The acting isn't always perfect, as being low budget some of the actors are clearly low budget actors, but it didn't ruin the film for me at all. I still absolutely loved it.If you haven't seen Cube, do so! It's one of those that every movie lover should have seen.",Cube
556,feilertsen,I LOVED IT!!,9,20 September 2002,"I quickly read some of the reviews of this movie, and it seems to me that most of the reviewers didn't like it as much as I did...I loved the movie!I remember seeing a trailer for it on TV when it was still in theaters, and thought ""WOW! I've got to see this!"" Of course I never got around to see it then... BUT, when I finally got around to buy a DVD player I found this movie on an internet shop for about £10, and bought it instantly.And I was SHOCKED! I found the movie to be one of the most intense thrillers I've ever seen, with a clever ""non-bulls**t"" plot. When the movie was finished I sat quietly with my mouth open for a few minutes (probably drooling.. :), and the I just pushed play and watched it again!This is my opinion: great script. great directing/production (they get a lot out of a very low budget). great acting (most of the characters anyway, they overplay it a bit, but I think it fits with the situation that they're in. Especially David Hewlett (in the role of Worth) does a great job!).I just keep watching it again and again, and it's always exciting!MY KIND OF MOVIE!",Cube

559,Nick-Brigden,Spooky,9,5 February 2003,"Firstly, I'm not an actor but I can't see what's wrong with the acting in this movie. Maybe thesps will, but for the rest of us, the acting in no way spoils this movie.In fact, there's very little about this movie that spoils it - it's damn good. It provides antidote to the many run-of-the-mill horror films that are out there. It's a testament to the scriptwriters that they manage to make such a weird premise work so well and be so tense throughout the entire movie, right from the very start.The ending is a little unsatisfactory, but it would have been very difficult, and more disappointing, to end the movie any other way. You'll still go away from the movie feeling freaked out.",Cube

561,wp3153159,Like Cube itself this film is a work of (evil) genius,9,11 February 2003,"I watched Cube again a few days ago and got far more out of it the first time. It's one of those films which creates a mood and leaves you thinking about it for days afterwards, kind of alters the way you look at things. I think that is what film making at its best is all about.Cube is a terrifying film, a kind of Orwell/ Huxley nightmare. Somehow a group of people have been trapped in an endless maze of cubic rooms some containing the most lethal traps. Their task, presumably - they are given no instructions - is to avoid the traps and find the exit before they die of hunger and thirst. It's a terrifying thought that innocent people can be taken from their own homes in the middle of the night and transported to such a cruel and devilishly sophisticated experiment. You wonder who could have the power to do such a thing: the characters speculate, government, a Bond style supervillain? but they never can find out for sure, no evil genius ever presents himself and indeed it would be a total letdown if they did. The main character in the story is the implacible Cube itself, an endless 3D maze of 14ft-on-a-side cubic rooms each with 6 exits to ajacent rooms (including ceiling and floor). There are no windows of course and each room is lit by its glowing walls. Different rooms have different colours, red, blue, green and white and this brilliantly adds to the eerie feel and look of the film. Each coloured room has an atmosphere of its own, the white ones of definitely the most cheery, its as bright as daylight and you can see the colours clearly: but there is no guarantee that a white room doesn't contain a trap, in fact there seems to be no correspondance between colours and traps, that would be too easy.But there is a way to get through the maze, each room has a number written along its edges and its possible to work out a way out from that, provided you have enough mathematical ability. The cube is already mathematical in terms of being such an ideal geometric structure and this ""number theory"" twist adds greatly to the intrigue. It involves the audience as they try to solve the puzzle themselves and also gives the characters something to do. Some of the characters - is it coincidence - do have mathematical ability.There are five characters in the film, as you might expect they are an eclectic bunch with more than usual amounts of emotional problems and eccentricities. Imagine waking up in a cubic room with nothing but identical rooms all around! After coping with the shock and rising terror, the characters set off to find a way out and naturally different personalities start to assert themselves. Some characters are natural leaders others are more thoughtful. Some hopeful of a way out, others just despair accepting death as inevitable. It turns out that one if tangentially responsible for building the cube in the first place adding to the paranoid feeling that NO ONE IS SAFE.The acting in this film is excellent, you really believe in the whole cube concept from the start. The actors really make you feel how frightening and disorienting it would be and there is superbly believable and fascinating interactions between them as they each find their place in this frightened little group. Although they cope well there is throughout a sense of underlying tension, a feeling of just-controlled panic, which is exactly how you would feel in that situation! There is good character development too as the movie goes on and we find out more about each character's lives and personalities.The directing and cinematography of the film are superb, the whole concept of Cube is just amazing and the visuals do full justice to it. The look of the film is reminiscent of Kubrick at his most spooky and disorienting. There is one scene in particular where the characters are trying to get though a sound-activated trap. One by one they crawl through it in total silence gesturing to each other. I was scared to make any sound myself, it was completely electric! It takes a daring director to have five minutes of silence in a film and this really paid off. It reminded my particularly of 2001 EVA scenes.If I have a complaint at all it is about the ending. I wont reveal it of course, but I would have prepared something happier. After all they've been through, I would have preferred to see the characters succeed, especially cynical worth and the mathematical girl, they really deserved to get out. I would have rewritten the last few seconds, but nothing else.The 3D maze known as Cube is a work of evil genius created by persons of institutions unknown. I would say this film is also a work of genius, not evil but certainly terrifying, disturbing and deeply moving. I would definitely recommend it, but be prepared for some sleepless nights... (and an obsessive interest in prime numbers!)",Cube
562,Automaton,Made in Canada,9,15 February 2003,"I really must say, that as corny as it sounds, this film made me proud as hell.... although many films are shot in Canada, relatively few are actually Canadian projects. With the exception of Cronenberg's work, there is little in the Canadian film catalogue that really got me excited...Cube changed that - a Canuck feature from conception to distribution - shot on a low budget, it really surprised me with it's quality. It's like the classic Twilight Zone channeled by Clive Barker. The acting is decent, the concept is genius, the visual design is innovative and made maximum use of resources without looking cheap. A thought provoking, stylish hybrid of sci-fi, horror, and whodunnit (and we still don't really know shodunnit by the end, Cube occupies an honored place in my collection.",Cube

The characters are perfect for the roles they were assigned to.  I don't think there is anybody else who could have played them better.  If you watch it for the first time, you should watch it alone, in a dark room, without being interrupted. That is how the movie will have the best effect on you.  This movie really makes you think for a long time afterwards.  The ending of this movie would not have been better any other way.  It tells you just enough to feel like a right ending, and still wonder for hours about what, who, why.  This is definitevely one of those films you should see at least once in your lifetime. Just watch this movie! You will not be dissapointed.",Cube

565,Harold_J,Better with the sound turned off,2,6 April 2003,"To begin on a positive note, this is a very beautiful film.  The sets are wonderfully made and fantastically lit, the costumes are great, the cinematography wonderful, the special effects top-notch.  The story's theme will be familiar to anyone who has read Sartre's ""No Exit"" or has seen the Twilight Zone episode ""Five Characters In Search Of An Exit.""But where it falls apart is the writing. Characters in tense situations suddenly stop and make speeches declaring their personal philosophies, or criticizing the personal philosophies of the other characters.  Dialogue is wooden and pretentious, as bad as anything in ""The Langoliers"" (a movie which showed that good actors can't necessarily deliver bad dialogue convincingly.)  It wasn't just the dialogue - situations and events were at times painfully predictable, as though they had been taken from a handbook of cliches. And the characters were never really developed - I wasn't able to care about any of them. Maybe I had the misfortune of reading some very good science fiction at the time (the ""Dangerous Visions"" collection) and had developed a very low tolerance for bad writing, but my two non-science-fiction-fan friends who were watching the movie with me had the same opinion.This movie is so visually compelling, I realized that it works better as a sort of pantomime - more than eye candy, less than a visual feast, but still an interesting optical meal.  Turn off the sound, turn on some good music, sit back, and enjoy the show!",Cube

Its open to your own personal interpretation.I see the Cube as a symbol of what happens when people stop asking question. If humans just follow traditions and habits without seriously consider what the essential is for each individual we will see that we will build a world where we get caugt up in all sorts of norms that has nothing to do with the world that we would like to see.The construction of the real Cube has already begun! If you dont believe me just take a look at your own life. We used to work in able to survive, now we have created a world where work is the meaning. It has become a norm that you have to work 5/6 days a week so that you can get all sorts of status symbols to impress your friends that do the same. Its a trap that we dont see but it is diverting us from what is essential in life. Love, compasion, time, mental development etc. We dont even have time to raise our own kids. We choose to pay money to institutions so they can raise our kids. Yeah, we have to remember that we do not have enough time to raise our own kids because we have to work. When our parents get old we also send them away as we havent got time for them aswell. Finally, when we ask ourselfes...what do I live for we see that we havent got any time to live.

A mathematical genius, a mentally challenged guy, a maniac, a psychiatrist and other persons make up the group. They want to make the movie gripping but the acting is horrible and unpredictable. It's almost a joke. It's almost like saw II, but a far less enjoyable version of it. But i am willing to forgive the acting for a somewhat decent plot. But what i am not trying to forgive is the ending which takes aways everything the movie has to offer. It's unsatisfiable. Go watch saw II or The exam if you haven't watched that before",Cube

These two blunders really shot the movie down!

Have much more coverage of the cube maze inside and then outside structure and have some of the characters manage to escape and go outside showing the structure and realizing how simple the complex was being much smaller than they thought when they were trying to get out as the cells moved.It's too bad about the poor ending because this movie had great potential.

You want a philosophical film, go watch Solaris. It's a mystery to me why this film is so universally loved. The concept is fantastic, I admit but the execution is pretty lousy. The acting is pretty solid I suppose but considering the characters are all caricatures that really isn't saying much. People try to excuse the acting by saying that this movie is a critique of human society. That makes me curious to what sort of society these people live in. We live in a peaceful society where death doesn't wait round every corner. Not really like Cube then. The script needed a lot of work as well; whilst the first half of the film is actually quite well written, when things start to go wrong it falls apart. Especially the ending. **SPOILER**The cop coming back to kill those last two characters was, lets face it, because they couldn't think of another way to get rid of them. And the ending itself was another cop out. 'existentialist?' American Beauty is existentialist. Fear X is existentialist. This is just a mess.**SPOILER END**Cool traps and situations do not a film make. There is so much missing from this film that I really cannot find much to recommend it. And, after the whole experience, nothing is resolved, nothing is discussed, just a bunch of immature conspiracy theories that are supposed to make people think 'yes, they're being clever by not explaining things' whereas they are actually making extremely generalized statements and trying to pass it off as philosophy and social analysis.",Cube

I think I felt that the case was lost when I watched Blair Witch project, but then I saw Cube. It uses logic very well - you really feel an affinity for the frustration of the characters, then you are trying to work out the reason why they are there and the noises and the strange markings and the reason some directions are good and some are not. Thus, it gets you involved in the action, it gets you involved in the thoughts of the characters, and you are trying to solve the puzzle with them. I truly can say it shocked me in places - one of the characters dies in a most surprising/impressive way, so much that you felt almost as scared as the characters.Truly a great film - to those who like horror/action/logic, well worth seeing.",Cube

574,beste-iris,"If you like inventive or intelligent films, than don't let the ratings here fool you",3,6 November 2014,"You like Primer, Pi and movies like that? Chances are you stumbled across this highly rated flick in the suggestion bar. Let me ruin the dream for you: don't expect too much of this. This movie certainly isn't 'dumb' in any way. The problem is that it pretends to be extremely intelligent while it's completely average. The story is in fact very basic, so are the mechanisms that are described in the movie. Nothing is mind-blowing at all, yet it pretends to be, which is frustrating to watch if it isn't really new to the watching audience. I don't think movies NEED to be mind-blowing to be fun, but this is pretending to be mind-blowing while it isn't at all. That combination is slightly awkward.Besides that, the dialogue is poorly written. Characters are written badly and character development is forced into conversations at cringe-worthy moments. It feels as if the writers didn't really know how to otherwise introduce the characters and it results in unrealistic conversations and confusing and awkward shifts in behavior. If you have any experience whatsoever in professional story telling, than safe yourself the annoyance of watching this. It'll just frustrate you.All in all, this was a real let down. I guess I should have let the ratings guide me a bit better, if everyone votes a 10, then that can't be realistic. I wish people would be a bit more critical. This is in no way a fantastic movie. Apparently it really amuses some people and I think that's a great achievement, but to me (and to a couple of other buried reviews here) this was really awkward to watch. In fact, I'd go as far as to call it extremely frustrating to watch. I think that's sad, because the concept is absolutely fascinating, and the actors seem to have some talent going on, but the story and the writing really brings it down.",Cube
575,martinjrigby,C*n*d*a*s should stick to playing hockey....,1,15 November 2004,"I really don't know where to begin with this atrocious movie. Okay, take a fairly original idea shrouded with intrigue... throw in a bunch of diverse characters (a sleazy cop, a feminist medical doctor, a convict, a math student, and a mentally challenged guy). Mysteriously they awake to find themselves trapped in a cubic prison. The cube is composed of various number and color co-ordinated rooms, some of which are death traps. The people trapped inside must find a way out. But perhaps more pertinent issues need to be addressed first... How did they get in there? What is the cube? Who built it? What is its purpose? Maybe the vague outline above is intriguing, but all that evaporates when the dialogue commences. The acting in this film is possibly..no wait ..probably, no.... definitely the worst i have ever had the displeasure of viewing. Wooden is not the word..it makes Keanu look like Bob De Niro! Maybe you can blame the script. Comments such as ""Only the Military Industrial Complex (MIC)could have built such a thing"". What? I know (or my girlfriend knew and subsequently told me) that the MIC is not a government organization, its not even a physical entity, its an ideology more akin to the oedipus complex than a government initiative.

576,ComboTron,An original plat which will leave you thinking,8,3 February 2005,"Two months ago, a movie called ""Cube"" was announced in my local TV guide. The article said it was a horror and action movie with sci-fi influences, but after watching it I absolutely don't agree. This movie doesn't contain bloody killings, disturbing images and stunning special effects, but just good actors and a very claustrofobic atmosphere.The story is simple but effective. Seven completely different people wake up in a enormous cube with thousands of cube-shaped rooms. When they meet they decide to work together to escape and to avoid the many boobytraps which are hided in several rooms. But the boobytraps aren't the only danger. Their will to survive and stress starts to appear as the time progresses and will be crucial to their movements and finding the exit.The movie starts very well and haves some very surprising plot inversions. The acting is good, especially Andrew Miller did a great job playing an autistic man. I've worked a couple of times with mental ill people, and I can assure you Miller did a great job playing one.However, I must say there was a part I didn't like. The people try to find a explanation; who build it, why did they put them in it and what is the usefulness of it all. It takes away the speed and the tension of some scenes and it doesn't add something to the story. I noticed that most characters were more busy finding a explanation about why they were in it instead of finding the exit.After all this movie haves a very original plot and leaves you, thinking about your decisions. A must-seen for every alternative movie lover.",Cube
577,gadgetnall,Fantastic science fiction,10,16 January 2014,"Cube is a great example of a fantastic low budget science fiction movie. In fact I would say even leaving the budget out of the matter it is flat out a fantastic science fiction movie and I would put it up against the best science fiction movies of it's era. It is about a group of people who don't know each other at all who were all abducted out of their homes by nobody knows who, but probably it is some kind of covert black ops military or CIA group. They wake up trapped inside a giant moving cube and every so many minutes all of the rooms inside the cube move randomly. Also they have to worry about traps because many of the random rooms in the cube which all look the same have deadly traps which include cutting them up, burning them, and so on, and they don't know until someone enters the room if it is safe or not. It's up to these people to get to know each other and to try to figure out a way to get out of the cube alive. If it is possible at all that is.",Cube
578,cvance-921-664440,Stunning Achievement,10,11 February 2014,"Cube is a stunning achievement in film making but everyone involved and especially by the film maker who created it. The movie is an incredibly brilliant idea that clearly was created on a very small budget, small as in compared to other mainstream feature length movies. The entire movie (except for short sequences at the very beginning in which people are taken) takes place on just the one set which is a giant cube made up of smaller cube rooms, and every once in a while the cubes move so that they are adjacent to different rooms. The people end up hooking up and have to decide if they should stay, or move to try to find their way out, and if so which way. Things get really nuts when they realize some of the rooms are booby trapped with incredibly deadly results. How can they find their way out? Is there even a way out at all? Who built this thing? It's incredibly tense and fantastic storytelling.",Cube
579,chunkybutter2000,Already a Classic,9,10 January 2015,"I think Cube has become a classic at this point. It used a very clever premise that has been re- used a number of times now; people 'trapped' somewhere who are strangers, and they need to band together if they want to escape/survive.The nice thing about this movie though, for me, is the mystery of who made the cube and why - and it's never actually revealed. It seems the most obvious guesses would be A) a government experiment of some sort, or B) some super wealthy company or person playing games just because they can. I haven't seen the follow-ups films, but I'm going to put them on my list. I am curious if those films reveal who is behind the cube itself and if the technology advances along with each installation. Ideally those films don't end up souring my opinion of this one, because I enjoyed it immensely. Highly recommended to fans of sci-fi",Cube
580,victor-kirov,"Good idea, bad execution",3,29 August 2016,"The Cube started off with an entertaining opening scene. All I can say about the rest of the movie is that it was about 90 minutes long. B-grade acting, questionable math and philosophy references, cop-out plot development, and an ending which was probably written when Nguyen got bored of writing and just wanted it all to end are just some of the many things to distract you while you constantly ask yourself where this movie is going and why you're still watching it. If this movie had an underlying meaning then it could only be explained by the speech given by one of the protagonists about a third through the movie after which everything just goes South. I'm not sure why the rating is so high or why this movies has received so much praise from other reviewers. My only guess is that most of the reviewers are from its country of origin, Canada, and they're too polite to say how much they want their 90 minutes back. 3/10 would not recommend.",Cube
581,baldiniebaldini,I see no movie in this movie,5,3 April 2016,"Cube provides almost nothing to feed a curiosity for sci-fi. ""Almost"" because its context happens to be original, but inadequately shallow, as describe below.The context: a maze made of cheap-looking cubic rooms rendered with basic CGI. Each cube may either have one mortal trap or be safe. Each cube has a coordinate printed in it.The story: no story or explanations, just some characters randomly moving from one cube to the next and randomly dying one by one.The characters: five stereotypic characters put in the maze, more or less. These are: a cheap leader boss taking control of the group and killing those who don't obey; a cheap genius high-school girl computing prime numbers up to millions; a cheap autistic psychopath supercomputing numeric powers to help the above girl; a cheap jail-breaker with a pragmatic attitude, and some more characters I don't remember.

582,tigerpawraw,Cool premise; poor acting.,6,22 March 2018,"All things considered, this is a movie worth checking out if you're a fan of mind-bending sci-fi flicks and, more importantly, aren't turned off by terrible acting. And let me be clear; the acting is awful.Save for the guy who plays ""the Ren"" (or is it ""the Wren""?), I found every actor to be amateurish and oftentimes annoying. Subtlety isn't a strong suit for any of them, but neither is the ""over-the-top"" mode that a few of them seemingly default to. Unfortunately, this is a movie with a lot of dialogue and interaction between characters, so the poor acting is constantly in your face. To be fair, I'd never seen any of the actors (save for the Ren) in a movie prior to this one, which makes me think they might not've been very experienced when they made this movie. Also, I imagine the budget wasn't huge for this one, which probably limited the powers that be from hiring more experienced/talented actors. Still, it had to be mentioned. All that said, I think I'd recommend this to hardcore fans of sci-fi movies who value plot more than acting.",Cube

If only they were a bit more careful with their numbers... And as for many, many reviewers who went huh when the prime numbers were presented... hello, people. I don't know what about the US, but in most European countries, this stuff is taught in basic schools. By the way, 4 cannot be a prime number. But, in the movie, it is. Obviously, the screenwriters didn't go to school either.But aside from that, it is a fun indie movie that squeezes everything out of its potential. The eerie and futuristic cube is pretty, the traps are maybe not the most original in existence (although the first scene was good enough to get ripped off in another, much more expensive and wide-released film), and the low budget doesn't keep it from being highly entertaining.",Cube
584,nickatron,Please DON'T WATCH this film. Your time is valuable,1,25 December 2005,"I have watched this film twice. Many years ago I watched it and I remember thinking how bad it was. Then it happened to be on again and I wanted to see if my hatred was still justified, so I watched it again. It is. The characters are entirely unbelievable and by the end I wanted them all to die. The plot is beyond ridiculous and pointless. The dialogue is utter tripe and I have seen better acting from drunk children. The cinematography is non existent, as is the score for that matter. What doctor would not realise the kid is autistic from the first minute? What maths geek takes ages to realize even numbers are not prime? How does the mentally challenged kid suddenly start communicating better at the end? The list goes on...I write this review because I don't want other people to go through what I did. Twice. If I could afford it, I would buy every copy of this film and burn it because I know I would be doing the right thing for humanity. Please remember, your time is valuable and this movie takes that from you. Honestly, I would gladly choose wandering that cube with no eyesight or legs than have to watch that film again.What hurts even more and even bring tears to my eyes is that many people have given this film a high score and it is now standing near 7.5! I usually have deep respect the IMDb audiences' opinions and I cannot fathom how there are people out there who think this is intellectually challenging or indeed, in any way shape or form, entertaining. Just because a film has rubbish special effects, lots of dialogue, 'people with diverse backgrounds' and a completely nonsensical plot (that only that autistic kid could decipher) doesn't mean the film becomes an intellectual challenge to work out. It's only challenging because you spend a couple minutes afterwards wondering if the film has actually ended, is it possible to sue to the television company responsible for airing this and how did you get yourself into this awful situation.Please, I plead with you, Spend your time doing something else. Anything else will add value to your life. This does nothing but suck value away and leave you feeling strangely violated and sad as you increasingly realize that no amount of money can buy back what this film has raped you of.",Cube
585,jonahcapani,"Fantastic movie with some great writing. Very tense, but in a good way.",9,30 May 2016,"So many people talk about how bad the writing is but in my opinion, it's the delivery of the dialogue that is bad. My 9 out of 10 is for the poor acting. The actual script is very good and paints accurately how everyone begins to turn against each other and they begin to break apart from group to individual. I just really wish they got people who could actually act. The art design was excellent, the directing and editing was very good. There are a lot of nuances in the writing that you pick up on after watching the movie multiple times, such as the theme of 6. The only actor i actually liked was Worth. He had a character and painted him very well. Quentin way overacted everything to the point where it was comical and everyone else was just weak. Wrens was alright too. The writing in my opinion is the movie's strong point. If the writing was bad, the movie would never have gotten as popular as it is.",Cube

The idea is similar to Saw in the sense where the characters have to think their ways through/around booby traps etc., but the plot in this film goes beyond evading traps. Rather, the characters are attempting to figure out where they are,how this giant cube was created,why they have been randomly chosen to be thrown into this trap, and who is responsible. This film will keep you guessing what's really going on, and how the people are going to get through each booby trapped room. If you like cerebral movies, this is a movie for you. Although the acting may have it's melodramatic moments, it is still a movie worth your time. Not to mention, you will never guess the ending.",Cube

It's also one of those rare films that stays with you long after you've seen it. One of the biggest questions not only while you're watching it, but after is 'Why?' what is the purpose of the cube? Is some sicko watching? Is it a way to play games with mankind, to test our intelligence, endurance , tolerance of one another, humanity, and survival instincts?If so, it's a cruel but excellent way to do it. Does fear reveal the true us? If so, can we still care about others when we're on the edge? can we put others survival before our own? Can we maintain our humanity when we're almost certain we're going to die? Well, in this movie, some do and some don't. What is this film trying to say about the human race,is it that we instantly devalue certain people because they're disabled, geeky, or physically weak.What does it mean by showing that the macho hero type cop (usually a movies saviour) is the least human and the most destructive within the cube, and that the smallest, youngest person, 'the female geek' and the autistic boy are the two that figure the way out. The autistic boy is the only person capable of not abusing another, not being judgemental and being compassionate even to the nasty guy (remember him stroking the cops hair) Is that why only he survived? was he the only one who really deserved to get free of the cube? If so, is the writer saying the meek really will inherit the earth?",Cube

I think it was very good that it wasn't explained how they actually got into the Cube. That was partly I feel the point of the whole thing.

These were not flaws!  How on earth could someone just *forget* to explain how the people got there, or who is behind it all, or what is outside the cube? This movie is one after which the viewer is allowed to draw his or her own conclusions and use his or her own imagination.  This is not a common practice nowadays with the constant dumbing of society through television and movies, but it is a highly effective one when done correctly, such as Cube has done.

It seems that people are being put into `the Cube'; a huge, man-made structure that was built as a result of the bureaucratic machine gone mad.  In fact, the Cube itself could be viewed as a physical icon of that bureaucratic madness.The suspense builds within the plot and within the characters themselves, leading to the end of the film which is as unpredictable as the story itself.  The main characters are antagonistic among themselves, but they have a shared goal of achieving freedom from the cube, whose rooms are loaded with death dealing traps that slowly pare the cast of characters down in various gruesome ways, leading to help from the unlikeliest of sources.I liked the Cube , even if it did have a lot of loose ends and unanswered questions.

I think CUBE should be considered a classic, because we can recognize some of our human qualities on it, and the people on CUBE represent people living on Earth. In a Place, that can be paradise if we take the best of us and put it on service to the other. This is what happens in the movie. There is people there that undestand that they don't live alone and work with the other to find the exit to a better place. And there is people, as the cop, that doesn't understand it at all and think that the other people in the CUBE is there to be USED to his profit, to find the exist. He doesn´t care about them. As a conclusion the movie should be a classic because it is a single situation that you can translate to all the world, is something universal. It is a good reflexion, quite pessimistic, in line with Sartre, about our world. Let's make world a better place. ROD-JOE.",Cube

604,Eudemon-2,Put five people in a box and watch them squirm.,8,1 August 1999,"I originally watched ""Cube"" at a film festival that was on in town. I was anticipating it a great deal as the idea was reasonably original and I liked the sound of it.  I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.For me, ""Cube"" was suspense. Each of the characters could either be seen as an individual or as a typical character archetype.  Either way the most impressive feature about the film was the raw emotion I felt.  Through the style of shots and overall sound you are kept in suspense the whole way through.I do have a number of points though.  For one, the appearance of the sound boom in the first scene in the first cube, even though it must have been intentional (it better have been) it did seem quite out of place, and I don't care what meaning you attach to it, you don't show the equipment.Secondly, the acting did seem a little contrived.  Right from the word go I was not convinced of the reality of the characters, but interestingly enough grew to like the nihilistic character.  He was the only character to go through some sort of change, everyone else suffered a mental breakdown and had a mental collapse.Lastly, the ending.  Very soft.  It could've been more, but it will do. It leaves you hanging, but that's about it.  There's no gratification and in the end the end has to be my least favourite part of the movie.At any rate, a very good film that I would recommend to people, purely for the atmosphere, but definitely not for the characters.",Cube

And early on, as the group explores the rooms and begins to ask the obvious questions about their situation, the movie seems very promising.Unfortunately, that promise is never fulfilled.  Instead of exploring those questions -- where are we?  why were we chosen? who built the Cube? -- the writer takes the easy way out, as the second half of the movie degenerates into nihilistic pointlessness.

What's the point of great acting if the story is weak?We never know what happened before and after this movie.  This is the way it should be.  If you want to see the big, evil Man throw these people into the Cube, go watch a Hollywood movie.  I see this movie as possibly a metaphor for life, as pretentious as that sounds.  You don't know what was once before and you don't know what's after.  As one character proclaimed, we don't know why or how it came about except that he was part of it.  They kept building and architecting it but it never seemed to have a purpose.  It was self-perpetuating to no true end at all.The acting was solid if not spectacular.

I am usually a strong person and movies don't affect me after I finish them, most of the time. Last night, after watching this movie, I was afraid to close my door.  I wouldn't let my dog leave my bed.  I find myself sizing everybody up, seeing how they would react to the cube.  I know I wouldn't be able to stand it.",Cube

It's only feelable, not to put in words but I'll give it a shot...",10,8 May 2001,"I cannot stress enough that you must (MUST!) see this movie. It's brilliant, although that word might be too limited to describe the coolness of this film. It's multi-multi-layered, with a new plot in every Cube (I won't give away too much, if you see it you'll understand AND agree with me for sure, provided you have a brain). Every time, each new plot is surprising, ashtonishing, just a thrill. Sometimes so exciting you'll be pushing to keep your attention to the movie because you forget not to think about how cool and thrilling it is. The plot unfolds more and more but everytime you discover something new, you figure out something you already knew. Or the other way around... When you think you understand one thing, the next is even a bigger questionmark. That accounts for the actors to, by the way. They ARE their played personalities. I'd be very afraid to run in on one of them in the street. Their characters are just like you and me, but in circumstances you will try to imagine. You almost get there, but not quite.I could keep going on like this, but you now know that you want to see this movie (or, as I said you don't have a brain ;-)), so run to your local videostore and rent it. Now. Before it's too late...",Cube

621,renumintal,"Great movie, upsetting end",7,23 September 2020,"The movie was great, acting is amazing, although I wouldn't leave a 10/10 rating, the ending was horrible, it was such a dark turn, which I feel was really pointless, as it doesn't even make sence to happen. It feels like the creator was really trying to make the movie have a dark ending. It's really emotional and upsetting how it had to have such a horrible ending. It really isn't pleasing to see Leaven, an innocent college student who just wanted to escape, as shown her so sad and desperate, and finally, figuring everything out, finding out where the exit is, getting to it, standing there, shocked that her terrifying moments in the Cube are basically over, and gets killed by Quentin, after all that effort, in hopes of finally desperately escaping, but the movie just lets her die like that, leaving the only survivor to be Kazan, who doesn't even feel like an actual character at all. The movie would've been way better if it wouldn't have decided to take such a pointless dark turn in the end. The ending really just ruined most of my enjoyment of the movie, so I'll have to say 7/10 instead of 10/10, even though the movie was an amazing and great production.",Cube
622,ori6187,One of the best!!!,9,26 December 2001,"Wow! I saw this movie with a lot of my friends that are usually just can't shut up but in the scene with the sound-activated trap the whole room was so quiet that I could hear my heart beating! I heard about this movie from one of my friends so we took it on video and liked every second of it, it is one of those movies that makes me sorry you didn't watch on big screen (alongside Braveheart and Private Ryan). The reason I liked this film so much is that it's a really smart one, it makes you thing about human nature and what would you do a such a dangerous place with total strangers that can be not what they appeared to be. Another good thing about this movie is that it's not an American one, if it was American there would be some sort of stupid ending to the film, not the wonderful end that it has now. One thing I know for sure,I am going to watch Hypercube (cube 2) on a big screen. rating: 11 (out of 10)",Cube
623,all_to_me,A frightening yet beautiful movie,9,18 July 2001,acting is a bit lagging in quality compared to the genious of the idea. the story is very thought provoking and at least as an engineer working through the problem of cube was very exciting. a very intriguing delight.  might as well say that its one of my favorites.,Cube

The most impressive parts of the movie were the ways the writers got rid of their characters.  A nice touch was naming the characters after prisons.  That was about as deep as the character development ever got.  I watched the film first without the director's commentary and then with.  My opinion wasn't changed much about the action of the film but I did develop a respect for the technical side.I take it that this movie was supposed to make you think and have deep philosophical value.  It just kind of reminds me of the conversations you had in college after a long night and a few beers when you and your buddies were just one brew short of the meaning of life.  I was very disappointed in this movie.  I think it could have been a lot better but all in all, I would much rather watch this than summer re-runs.",Cube

This film reminds me of Memento, a very low-budge film that is better than 95% of the high-budge films out there. Why? Because it relies on the story and the quality of acting to make it great, not C.G.I. and overpaid mainstream actors. Not only is it a well presented thriller, it's also a study of the breakdown of human emotions and sanity when kept in solitude outside of one's comfort zone. The cube tests the characters' ability to function and work together in alien territory while in constant imminent danger. This is just a brilliant film made by a brilliant writer/director. This movie is a must for any lover of psychological thrillers. - Rob",Cube

The special effects for a low budget movie like this one are okay and in some point they reach some realism that the movie needs to succeed.I found the acting very amusing and every single actor was a key to keep the suspense and the mystery going on pushing you every minute more closer to the screen. Sometimes the movie can be very irritating or may cause you a slight symptom of claustrophobia and edge paranoia,but thats the point.Get you out of your limits so that you can't beat the cube enigma.",Cube

I mean its really sad that all the characters, except for the disabled one and police guy, did something helpful with the plans of escaping the cube, but in the end they all died except for the disabled one, which I'm sure he will die soon since it's hard to believe that he will be able to find his way home. Most of the traps looked pretty deadly while some were just plain enough so that they could have been easily avoided, if the characters were smart enough to move (acid spray trap). overall, this movie was pretty suspenseful and keeps you awake making you think what's going to happen next.",Cube

The story was weak, the acting was.. not bad, but strained, as if they wanted to make up for the weak plot by trying harder to seem real.... if that makes sense...admittedly I am not a big fan of the horror gender per say, but I expected more from this...The was a brief moment early where it looked like it might get interesting, but that did not last, and the ending was welcomed as an end to my suffering, nothing more.If you are a real fan of sci-fi, or horror films you will find this lacking in most elements of either of those types of films, if you are a fan of films that leave you wondering what was the point of that mess, then have at it, you will probably find something to like.

It has a slow moving repetitive plot line. and certain things happen that are just not remotely convincing given the context of the situation. It does not provide satisfactory answers to any of the questions it raises. The whole time i was watching the movie I was tempted to just turn it off but I waited till the end in hopes that there would be some sweet clever ending that would make the whole thing worth it but even the ending sucked. Not to mention that this movie was so low budget that the whole thing was shot on one set using various colored lights. Please don't waist your time or money on seeing this film.,Cube
635,WB_Whiting,Theological Horror movie,8,8 December 2017,"""The Cube"" is a theological horror movie, the 'Cube' that the protagonists are trapped within represents the worldview of Gnostic Christianity. In this worldview, the universe is a 'Black Iron Prison', an ever shifting and changing death trap created by a wrathful inferior demigod. Within it is the 'Empire', an amalgam of all evil human institutions that wields power over humanity, all who fight against this 'Empire' must adopt its methods and find themselves becoming the next 'Empire'. The true higher god is outside this universe's reality, it breaks into this reality and attempts to save some humans from this trap. Read VALIS by Phillip K. Dick if you are interested in reading fiction further explaining this worldview.The characters suddenly awaken within the 'Black Iron Prison' of the Cube, aware of the predicament they are in, aware of the malevolence in the design of the universe. They, in their discussions, discover that humans built this Cube, that they and not a god are responsible for the evil state of human society that brought about this deathtrap and fed them into it.The numerology of the rooms is a clue pointing to a higher intelligence outside the Cube and its human builders. The characters find that they were wrong to move from their original room, that trying to discover a way out through their own intelligence (and not by a god) only led them astray and into ruin. The idiot-savant character represents how one must 'become like a child' to become saved, only through a god can come salvation.I am not sure if the creators of this film are portraying their own beliefs or if they are portraying a theology that they disagree with because it makes for a good horror scenario. Either way, this is a very interesting and well-made movie that has a hidden layer of depth that is meant to pass by most people unnoticed.",Cube
636,analogie,Worst movie I have ever seen,1,11 November 2007,"Probably the worst film I have ever seen. I was looking for science fiction, for thrilling content, new ideas. Maybe with energizing analogies to ""our"" real lives and catching dialogs between the characters. Am I asking too much?! What I found was the poorest and cheapest production of plan-less communication and a plot that wouldn't even make 20 minutes in StarTrek. From minute 10 on, it does not get better. I hoped for it continuously but was disappointed by the scenery and dialogs over and over. Not one scene is credible, not one solution to a problem is comprehensive. Watching this movie is a waste of time! You can't understand the ""Grand Finale"" unless you are an expert in math. In case you're not: You will find yourself watching crazy individuals in a cube. Eventually, they turn into team players. Before that, several crazy individuals will get hurt. No, not funny, just bad.",Cube

I first heard about the movie a week ago (July 2002), and I read on the cover what the plot was about. It sounded so exciting that I bought it right away. The movie satisfied my expectations too! A brilliant concept, where everyone starts in a zero-position, and as the movie goes on, the viewer get to know more and more of the cube. The people in the cube can be a symbol of a society, which contains all the parts that are needed to be complete. Everyone knows their things, and that keeps them developing during the whole movie. Also, the desperation and the anger are growing inside everyone of them during the movie, which shows the human nature.. and the strongest one's will survive. (?)

Cypher is an incredible film, and Nothing is one of the most inventive things I've ever seen.I'm so glad to finally see a director who really takes a chance with his subject material.  Highly recommend Cube right along with all of Vincenzo Natali's other films.Hollywood is filled with unoriginal ideas and boring directors.  I'm glad to see that this is starting to change with films like Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, and The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.However, skip Cube II: Hypercube, Vincenzo had nothing to do with it, and it blows.",Cube

I heard of the concept and being an enthousiastic supporter of intelligent SF, I eagerly sat down to enjoy a movie that would actually make me think. Well, I hoped it would.After what seemed like a very long time, disappointment reared it's ugly head. This was three minutes into the movie. The characters turned out to be 2-dimensional at best, the dialogue unconvincing and any thirteen year old school boy could have thought up the 'disturbing view of human nature'.If you're looking for a movie that rises above the level of a badly written morality play, try Ghost in the Shell, Donnie Darko, 2001 or A Clockwork Orange.

I don't know why so many people think this is great, to me it has less suspense and substance than a Twilight Zone episode. To be fair, there is some good suspense and the rooms show some imaginative set design. But that doesn't make up for all things that just don't make sense.It just shows that if you make a film obscure enough and tendentious enough some people will think it's great.",Cube

None of the ""psychological"" conclusions the viewer can gain from this movie haven't been available before in other (and much better) movies. By the way, I found it quite boring. A much better attempt (for speakers of German) at a very similar topic in human psychology can be seen in ""Das Experiment"" by Oliver Hirschbiegel, although published 4 years later.",Cube

It was a decent film. Not great, but decent.A slow start and middle, but the film becomes in the end suspenseful.

643,rugby02,Worst movie I've ever seen,1,6 June 2005,"This movie was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. That means a lot considering I just watched ""White Water Summer"" with Kevin Bacon. The director does not deserve any credit for filming the entire movie on a 14' by 14' set. YOU deserve credit if you can sanely stare at the same room filled with horrible actors for an hour and a half plus. I admit that the first 10 minutes was somewhat entertaining. But after that, the first ten minutes just repeats itself over and over and over and over. Please note that I am not an amateur movie watcher. I am an avid movie watcher and consider myself to have very good taste in movies. This was one of few movies that I actually had to turn off in the middle, because I couldn't endure the pain any longer. It wasn't even laughably bad like ""Evil Dead 2."" It was just bad.

I was so surprised at the overall story which is played out in one set and I always found myself tense as the next part of the story was unveiled. The characters were portrayed brilliantly and makes you question how well you would cope if you woke up in their situation. The story does seem to get a bit repetitive at times ""Oh this theory doesn't work, lets try this one, oh that doesn't work either."" but it's not really about the characters escaping but how they transform over the course of the film. Overall I would recommend this film only if you are willing to think deep and are willing to overlook the low budget and occasional clichéd dialogue and plot points. If you fit into that criteria then Cube is one of those films that beats some of the newer phsycological films out there.",Cube
646,Tjazzare,Simplistic yet captivating,8,26 July 2010,"Cube 1 is awesome. It's simple and captivating. The characters are dynamic and develop thoroughly throughout the movie just like you would expect them to. You are constantly bombarding your brain with questions like: Who oversees the Cube? What is the Cube? When is this all taking place? Why are these people in the Cube? Where is the Cube located? And how did these people get there? The director immediately pulls you out of your comfort zone and really forces you to open your mind. I feel people that have trouble accepting irrationalities would tend to dislike the film while their counterparts would tend to enjoy the mysteriousness of the plot.Throughout the first half of the film I figured it was a game. I kept my cool and tried to solve the puzzle along with the characters until about half-way through when I came to a realization that maybe there was no purpose. Ironically I felt the purpose was to try and convince people that sometimes there just isn't a purpose/reason for why things happen. A buddy of mine suggested the movie was a metaphor for life.There were times when I wanted to end the movie short because I didn't want to lose the mysteriousness and anticipation I had built up throughout the film. I speculated the ending to be elaborate and informative but I was afraid it wouldn't live up to my expectations. A psychological experiment supported by Big Brother? Aliens? A rich and sadistic killer's horror house? Purgatory? A dream? The movie ended perfectly and I couldn't help but want more. I even watched it again 30 minutes later. The sequels suck. Not only were the poorly produced but the movies tried to answer questions I honestly didn't want answered. I don't want to say the sequels ruined the first film, but you'll definitely have a different (not necessarily in a good way) perspective of Cube 1 after having seen the sequels.",Cube

The music and a lot of the camera-work is boring and unappealing. The editing is haphazard with cuts in strange places. The plot barely makes any sense and there is absolutely no pay off what so ever.The premise is somewhat original but is hampered by everything else. The only other saving grace is the special effects which are semi acceptable for a film of this budget and age. The film tries to deal with important subjects which other reviewers have mentioned, but does so in a terrible and uninteresting way. I can't overstate how bad this film actually is. It genuinely has some of the worst acting and dialogue I've seen in years.

Well played but nothing more than predictable reactions.In fact the whole plot even though more original, deep and captive than most horror genre type movies was very predictable.

654,gr33dy,A group of people arguing in a box.,1,27 November 2003,"The best opening scene in a film ever?Well, perhaps not, but it was good. Unfortunately this was the high point of the film for me - until the closing credits, that is.The basic premise - kill as many of the characters as possible in wierd and interesting ways - is a valid one. Let's face it, that's the bread and butter of horror movies. Unfortunately, with the opening scene out of the way (and most of the budget with it, it would seem) we are left with a collection of two dimensional characters trapped in a series of increasingly desperate situations. And by desperate I am of course referring to the desperation of the screen-writers in attempting to get to the last page of the script whilst divesting of themselves the least effort possible.As far as characterisation goes, we have the token black man, (who is of course, toast). We have the ""hard-bitten NY Cop"", the ""loveable retard"", the ""coward"", and of course the ""guy who is returning to his home-town to marry his sweetheart and play football"" (who subsequently loses his legs and is horribly disfigured. Natch.) etc. etc. etc. Oh, and the mentally deficient one turns out to be an Idiot Savant, which is handy.Some people will tell you that the film explores human nature under pressure, human interactions, human emotion, human blah blah blah. Substitute the word ""explores"" with the phrase ""bludgeons ineptly at"", and you're nearer the truth. And so we are left with a group of people arguing in a box.I can see why the evil mastermind is trying to kill them all, they are all insufferable idiots.

656,raftrommelmans,Thoroughly scary psycho horror.,8,13 February 2004,"Since the entire movie set probably consisted of two rooms with red, blue, green and white lights behind it, this is probably the best basic horror idea I've seen made into a movie in years. Simple use of contrast techniques make the characters look awfully surreal and ready to lose it in a second, making you pretty much uncomfortable from beginning to end. People probably do strange things when they think they're going die for no particular reason at all, and it's good to see that none of the psychological problems the characters face are far-fetched. They're ordinary everyday-life kind of problems. It's just that the movie's not set in everyday-kind-of-life circumstances. Pretty believable I should say. (Not counting the cube-thing...) Really worth seeing. Makes it hard to open doors the first few hours after you've seen it.",Cube

The film isn't great, the actors are working, so kudos for them.. they tried, but there just wasn't a single brilliant performance... it doesn't leave you with a sense of ""wow"" - I would call it almost entertaining... but not quite.

Admittedly it has a fairly original storyline for its time(1997) but thats its only redeeming feature. It looked cheap and nasty, the dialogue could literally have been written by a 10 year old and the black actor (it made such an impression that i can't remember his name) obviously got bottom marks on his drama exam as the only way he portrayed emotion was through wild staring and pursed lips.

661,RosieCottonBomull,"Excellent and original, if gory",9,21 April 2005,"I only saw this movie very recently, and was absolutely stunned. I can count exactly thrice in my life when I came out of a movie with my jaw this close to the pavement; that would be for Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, I Robot, and Cube. The difference is that I saw the other two on the big screen. Even on my antiquated TV and badly-set up sound system, this movie floored me.The acting was close to perfect. The setting was wonderful. With one cubical room and twenty days to shoot, this film manages to give us more suspense and better acting than all of the expensive dramatical sets of ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Ring"". In a dramatic style almost comparable to Shirley Jackson's wonderful ""The Lottery"", the movie starts out relatively slow; no music, no interpersonal tension, and we're not sure what's going on. Slowly, over the course of the movie, the tension begins to build and build. By halfway through this movie, you are absolutely glued to the screen, and balanced precariously on the edge of your chair. By close to the end, you feel like screaming (in a good way).I would give this movie a perfect ten out of ten, but for two things; the ending and the gore. The gore is not by a long shot overly-done or tasteless; but it is still a bit too much for sensitive me. Now, I understand perfectly that both of these things were needed, and that they fit well with the context of the movie; and I agree that cinematic ally, they absolutely work. I, however, do not personally enjoy them. Objectively, this movie receives a ten out of ten; personally, it's about a 9.3. (And yes, the math is shaky, but in most cases forgivable.)This is a brilliant, original movie. If you're looking for closure, good-guy-beats-bad-guy, normal English-class conflict, and Freytag's pyramid, for Heaven's sake go watch Star Wars. ""Cube"" is a movie for intellectuals and thinkers, for people who like to challenge reality as we know it and be left with food for thought rather than a satisfying conclusion. It's like an indie, leatherless, gunless Matrix--only better.I cannot say more without being forced to check the ""Contains Spoilers"" box; and since this is primarily a review for those who have not yet seen the movie, I don't want to do that. All I can say is; If you're not bothered by a little gore (and both instances of such are predictable, so you can cover your eyes), GO FOR IT. I highly doubt you'll be sorry.",Cube

I really begged for and ending in the final minutes, but then credits came without mercy....At least I wanted to know:Who in the hell created the cube (goverment).Where in the hell was located the cube (earth).What in the hell was outside the cube (desert).Why in the hell the mathematician had to die. I know this is an alternative film but PLEASE GIVE US A RELATIVELY HAPPY ENDING. Don't make us go depressed to bed.The social metaphors, the human relations complexity, the mathematical quizzes and the mysterious plot it is enough as an intellectual exercise. I WANT A CLOSED ENDING WITH ALL THINGS SOLVED. Anyway I didn't like Kubrick's 2001 neither, so maybe I'm not profound enough for this.Anyway, despite the frustrating ending, the terrible acting and overacting and the many holes in the plot, the film is worth seeing.

666,rukario-god448,"Interesting, if flawed",7,9 January 2015,"While not a Kubrickian exploration of the human condition, Cube, a well-structured, suspenseful and legitimately scary thriller can be quite effectively compared to the maze-like halls of the The Shining's Overlook Hotel. It's not perfect in any way, but if you enjoy a slow-paced horror like The Shining but find it a little complex this works fine. The film's cinematography is as disorienting as Gravity's with clever perspective tricks used to confuse which way is up and down and the use of one single set throughout the film borders on repetition but never quite reaches that extreme, instead finishing at a reasonable time (roughly 90 minutes in) and giving extremely limited glimpses of what lays outside the cube.The main flaws are macro-elemental, with clichéd writing, stereotyped characters and bland, uninspired performances. The actors are all unknowns and with writing as unfortunately bland as this film offers it's no surprise that their performances suffer also. There were also a couple of annoying plot holes which got strangely ignored, and although it is perhaps suitable to keep these mysteries as mysteries a greater sense of satisfaction at the somewhat unthoughtful ending would be apparent if there were some even subtle hints to what the secrets of the cube were.This isn't to say that the response isn't as intended - there are some standout sequences such as the incredibly tense scene where all of the characters have to traverse a room with sound-activated traps, and later on in the piece the characters do face some genuinely scary situations, the claustrophobia setting in on the viewers as well.So if you can put up with some uninspired writing it's not hard to like this film for its achievements.",Cube

And navigating through this puzzle soon becomes clear to be a problem.This movie has an interesting plot with some deepness to it. However the characters are not. Well played but nothing more than predictable reactions. in fact the whole plot even though more original, deep and captive than most horror genre type movies was very predictable. very obvious clue's are given and all plot twists can be figured out beforehand without much effort.All in all a decent movie that is not very scary with decent special effects, acting and a solid yet predictable plot.",Cube
669,PSirl,Yawn.,3,21 January 2006,"I recently hired this film on the advice of many of my friends. All I can say is I was extremely disappointed. The limited plot line simply involves 7 people running around a CUBE dying or attacking/shouting at one another. Less than 30mins into the film I was simply wishing they'd get on and die. I do give credit for the original idea behind the film but this simply wasn't enough. The undeveloped characters attracted no sympathy and the attempt at a twist at the end also failed. A much cleverer and entertaining film similar to CUBE is 'Saw'. It shows what CUBE had the potential to be. Instead an unfortunate waste of time and story is the result of Vincenzo Natali efforts. Gripping, this isn't.",Cube

A good film starts with the script. This script is something I would not read. It's just not good. A prison of random people who have to navigate from room to room inside a cube doing math. What? Why?What would a bigger budget mean? More cube rooms? More colors? Higher profile actors?You could get Tom Cruise, Clooney, Theron and co. and this still wouldn't be a better film.Nothing is explained at the end. I don't know why anyone would design a cube like that or have a prison with the possibility of an escape if you work together. Even in ancient times there were prisons were you can't escape. So why would the military-industrial complex build such a weak prison?It is implied that the state is responsible for this, not some psycho like Saw. But what's the point?",Cube

This was an absolute waste of 1.5 hours of my life. It was my turn to pick the movie tonight but my friend was insistent on this being one of the most thought provoking thrillers he has ever seen, so I gave it a try. To say the acting was atrocious in this film is an understatement. Whoever played Quentin(not wasting time learning his name) gave one of the absolute worst performances I have seen, and I did high school theater, so that's saying something. And don't even get me started on his character, the fact that this dude was proposed as the leader of the group, saved the doctor, and then dropped her voluntarily seconds after, us more puzzling than the movie itself. The one good thing I will say about Cube is the surface level concept, but that is literally it. If there's something I'm missing PLEASE let me know. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. 2/10",Cube

He's easily the worst performer of the group, which is saying something.Also, the movie falls prey to SO MANY clichés it was staggering. I mean, what kind of person suddenly remembers where they last were before appearing in the cube and shouts out ""pasta!"" to the rest of the befuddled prisoners? Is that supposed to make ANY sense??? Of course not, it only happens so that, just like every other terrible movies, the other characters can be all puzzled and ask what the woman means so that she can go into further detail beyond just the word 'pasta.'It doesn't make any sense.ALso, the idea that NO ONE in the cube could have possibly figured out that those strange groaning noises meant the cubes were all moving is ludicrous.

But hey, I'm sure they can serve one mean hamburger or park your car like the best of them. Anyway, back to Cube...it's not like the people didn't try....oh no they tried. Their effort unfortunately was quite visible and horrific to watch and not be embarrassed for them. Also, not to give anything away, but the 'special' guy's purpose in the movie was so painfully obvious that it was like waiting for your internet to connect in the early nineties. Long, painful, and not a shock when it occurs. If I had to rate the acting performance of these so-called actors,a simple A through F wouldn't suffice.

A handful of strangers wake up inside a bizarre maze, having been spirited there during the night. They quickly learn that they have to navigate their way through a series of chambers if they have any hope of escape, but the problem is that there are lethal traps awaiting if they choose their route unwisely. Having established some imaginative and grisly punishments in store for the hostages, co-writer and director Vincenzo Natali turns his attention to the characters, for whom being trapped amplifies their best and worst qualities. The film is, in fact, similar to a famous episode of Rod Serling's old television series, though Natali's explanation for why these poor people are being put through hell is a lot closer to the spirit of The X-Files. Cube has some solid moments of suspense and drama, and the sets are appropriately striking: one is tempted to believe at first the characters are lost inside a computer chip. --Tom Keogh",Cube

680,logsplitter,"Interesting concept, poor execution",5,15 July 2008,"I came across this title while searching for similar ""disturbing"" movies. The word ""disturbing"" did not come to mind while watching this, the fact that I was more occupied with ""should I make another cuppa?"" and ""should I put another load in the dryer?"" is sort of indicative of what I thought of this movie; it was BORING. The concept is interesting: a bunch of people being locked in a maze, lethal traps etc. How would they cope? Would basic instincts come alive and would the thin layer of civilization yield to survival methods?In this movie the subjects are hardly touched upon. Acting is pretty bad, especially in the beginning and more importantly, while watching it, the characters leave everything in doubt. Most of them leave me in doubt as to why they are put in the cube. Later on they find out why some of them are put in, these so called explanations however I find hardly satisfying. Some of the character's actions in the movie hardly relate to what they had been doing before they were locked, I found their actions and motives (what motives?) very hard to grasp.Visual fx were adequate, not very convincing or impressive. How people die and how movies portray it is not related to getting numb to this effect, mind you, it's just that this movie had some gruesome ways of dying in store but they were not portrayed very well. The actual cube, the outer shell, the inner rooms did not really give me the impression of being locked in, being alone and desolate or anything. Poor effort altogether.In short; feel free to watch it, I suppose it's one way of spending your evening but if you are in for a ""disturbing movie"" go and see something else. I haven't seen part II or III, in a way I hope they are a continuation of pt 1, but I'm not planning to go and watch 'em.",Cube

Well, that's the reason why I gave this movie 2 stars.The rest of this movie is a joke...literally. It is poorly acted to the point of annoyance. The dialogue is poorly written. The character development is inconsistent. Lastly, this movie is an insult to intelligence and education. Anybody who says this is a ""smart"" movie probably did not get farther than grade school algebra. This movie goes so far down the intelligence drain it claims the integer 567 is ""astronomical"" and almost impossible to factor without a computer (a cast comprised of a doctor, policeman, college student, and an architect).People will argue that it had a low budget, but low budgets are not an excuse for bad acting and a terrible script. There are movies with higher budgets and better acting and scripts that are scrutinized worst than this movie has been on IMDb.I do not understand why this movie has a such high rating on IMDb, and it really disappoints me that it does because it's very misleading. This movie is not above average. It caters to an audience who has no knowledge in simple math, similar to a movie like Hackers catering to audiences with no knowledge about computers. I believe the high ratings are solely for the movie's concept, which many agree to love. The concept alone is not enough to carry this poor movie.",Cube

A group of strangers have to work their way out of some kind of 3D moving maze, and they discover they each have talents which are critical to escaping.However, while the math girl is given some kind of 'genius' aura, it's a well known joke between people even vaguely versed in maths that the writers of the show don't have a GCSE or high school diploma (depending which country you're in) related to maths to rub between them.Maths lesson 101, if a number ends in 2,4,6, 8 or 0, it's a multiple of 2. If it ends in 5 or 0, it's a multiple of 5. There are other tricks too (sum of digits being a multiple of 3 means the number itself is a multiple of 3, via modular arithmetic) but the glaring errors in the maths whiz's skills makes it no longer a tense horror film, but a comical farce.Should you be less of a pedant than myself and friends then it's a very good watch.

This movie has long been on my list of random movies that I needed to watch and it did not disappoint. The ending is unbelievable and the acting is subpar, and in the year 2019 the 1990s special effects can be distractingly fake but still impressive. Overall though, it's entertaining to watch the characters pick apart the mystery of the prison that they find themselves. This is a study into the ultimate will to survive and whether or not teamwork is an essential element of it. The audience never really gets all the answers, but this puts us in the same position of insecurity and helplessness that the characters find themselves in.",Cube
