0,Leofwine_draca,"Some madcap action here, but the crude humour spoils it",5,16 May 2016,"CRANK is a post-modern Hollywood blockbuster in that it takes things backwards, actually appearing to be a low budget, poorly shot amateur movie. Every directorial trick in the book is thrown into the pot in this one, with crazy camera-work, hand-held cameras, shaky cams (worse than BLAIR WITCH!), POV shots, tracking, you name it. From the moment you see the crudely-drawn-on-a-computer title screen you know you're going to be in for a 'different' film and CRANK is very different in style. However, the plot is nothing new, and can basically be summed up as 'SPEED inside a human'. Jason Statham struts his action stuff as he goes on a rampage through the city, trying to keep his heart rate up by engaging in all kinds of antisocial behaviour. Thankfully the film only plays for eighty-odd minutes so the idea never becomes boring.Now, I enjoyed the action stuff in this film. The stand-offs and shoot-outs are stylishly handled and realistic and there are some imaginatively gritty moments, like when a guy has his hand caught in a sewing machine! The acting is generally good, with lots of intense stuff from Statham and Cantillo as the slimy bad guy, but who cast Amy Smart as Statham's girlfriend? Seriously, the blonde bimbo girlfriend role is terrible in this film, an awful part and Smart is horrible in it. Seriously bad. You never believe for a second that Statham's character would go for such a girl.Elsewhere the film contains plenty of comedy. Some of it is funny – the 'hand in a waffle toaster' gag is crude but effective, and the chopped-hand jokes are enjoyable. But the crude attempts at comedy are not so great, and a bit tired. I'm surprised Statham suffered the indignity of all the erection jokes and the sex-in-the-street scene is just embarrassingly bad. If it wasn't for the student-style laughs, CRANK would be an above-average action flick; as it stands, it's wildly uneven and inventive; half of it works, half of it falls flat. Worth watching but not more than once.",Crank
1,SnoopyStyle,Literally heart pumping fun,7,5 January 2014,"Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is Carlito's best hit-man. One morning, he finds that a small time rival Ricky Verona has injected him with the ""Beijing Cocktail"", a synthetic drug which inhibits the flow of adrenaline. In order to stay alive, he must keep the adrenaline flowing. Then he learns that Ricky is doing it with the approval of Carlito.This is literally heart pumping action fun. The style is hyper ADD. The story is insanely contrived. While the adrenaline rush lasts, the movie is high energy, funny, and loads of fun. Some of it is hilarious. Jason Statham has a great boner joke. The action does wear thin, but the humor is maintain. Statham is a great tough guy who fits perfectly for this role. Amy Smart plays the low energy girlfriend. She slows the movie down, at least until they get to Chinatown.",Crank
2,Prismark10,Crank,6,5 March 2020,Crank has been inspired by the film noir D.O.A that has been blended with Keanu Reeves action vehicle Speed.Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is a hitman who wakes and discovers that a rival hoodlum has injected him with a lethal 'Beijing cocktail' that will kill him.Chev needs to keep his adrenaline pumping long enough to stay alive and also hunt down the man who did this to him before he dies.Crank has a kinetic energy with its constant fast moving camerawork. There is plenty of violence. It is an absurd and ridiculous action film.It also has its share of bad taste with its many ethnic stereotypes. At one point Chev has sex with his girlfriend in the middle of the chinatown to keep his heart pumping.Despite the vulgarity it is stupidly entertaining as long as you switch off your brain cells.,Crank
3,claudio_carvalho,Unpleasant Anti-Hero,4,17 March 2007,"The hit-man Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is poisoned by the criminal Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) and his friend and doctor Miles (Dwight Yoakam) advises him that he must keep his adrenaline in an upper level to stay alive. Chev meets his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) and together he looks for Verona to kill him.""Crank"" at least in Brazil is one of the blockbusters in every rental and I expected to see a great action movie, since I am a fan of Jason Statham. Unfortunately the film is awful, paced like a video-clip or a video game, but the worst, with an unpleasant anti-hero. The guy kills, threatens, rapes, steals, summarizing, breaks all the rules of a civilized society to survive. In some moments, the situations are funny, but the black humor is supported by a criminal that trespasses the law practically in every action, therefore I personally hated this character. When he dies in the end, I was relieved. In times of great violence worldwide and specifically in my country, I would never like the apology to crime and lack of respect to the law demonstrated by Chev Chelios. The proposed black humor does not work. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Adrenalina"" (""Adrenaline"")",Crank
4,kosmasp,Helluva ride!,8,18 January 2007,"Crank's basic idea isn't really new. You have seen similar movies in the past (the chance is big that you have). Some might say that it's not a good movie. But it is definitely a guilty pleasure!The whole movie feels like you fast forward it. You don't have time to really think about. Besides the end that is, but more about that later. It's an good old fashioned action movie, that will excite (in more than one way). ;o) What I really like, is that the movie sets a tone and keeps it till the end.Jason Statham was an action star before Crank, but now everyone will notice him. Or at least they should. Amy Smart comes late in(to) the movie and she's more a sidekick, but it's OK, because it's a guy movie.And that brings me to two things that will/could leave a sour taste ... One is scene with Amy Smart and Jason Statham. I won't tell you about the scene, but I can assure you that most women won't like that scene ... They don't like it at all! The second is the ending. It falls short and it's a shame because the movie really would've deserved a better ending. At least that's what I'm thinking and I haven't anyone you disagree with that yet. ;o)If you can manage to keep your mind from thinking to much and are down for some ""manly"" action movie then go for it! It'll be worth your while!",Crank
5,gavin6942,Lots of Action... and Lots of Action... and Lots of Action,8,25 November 2007,"Oh no, something injected hit-man Chev Chelios with the Beijing Cocktail in his sleep. Now his body is being inhibited from taking in adrenaline, so he'll have to make his own or his heart will give out. So he uses everything he can: car chases, cocaine, Rockstar energy drinks, nasal spray, shock pads and more to keep the heart pumping. And it's Jason Statham.I'm not a big fan of action films. I like gangster movies somewhat (especially newer ones -- I'm not a ""Godfather"" or ""Scarface"" devotee). But I like Jason Statham (""London"") and I really liked this film. Despite having a weak plot, far too much CGI (something I usually hate but didn't mind here) and a scenario that's most likely impossible it just grabbed me by the throat and didn't let go.Maybe it was the humor. Seeing a guy go to such great lengths for adrenaline is pretty funny, and the creators really made a point of adding in smaller jokes for the video game generation. I especially enjoyed when the Asian man was speaking in subtitles, and the camera switched to show us that Chev could read them from where he was standing (something that obviously doesn't happen in the real world, but it works here).Maybe it was the cast. Besides Statham (the go-to man in action these days -- can't wait for ""Death Race"") they have his girlfriend played by Amy Smart (who looks hotter in this film than she's ever looked before and will probably ever look again). And Dwight Yoakam as Doc Miles... what a great role. Yoakam is such a cool guy (and makes me wish I didn't have such a strong aversion to country music).Whatever it was, I really loved this film. It flew by so quick, and I was sad when it had to end... I could have used more of this. In fact, that might be the film's bigger flaw: so many characters and no time for development. Another twenty minutes of exposition would have helped, but I suppose the key thing here was pacing. And maybe that decision was for the best. It worked, it really worked.",Crank
6,jboothmillard,Crank,4,1 November 2009,"I really liked the leading star in all three Transporter films, so I didn't see any reason not to at least try this vehicle that I recognised the title of. Basically professional West Coast crime syndicate assassin Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) wakes up, and is rung up by criminal Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who tells him he has been poisoned with ""The Beijing Cocktail"". Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam) tells Chev the only way he can stay alive is to keep his heart pumping with high adrenaline, however that is made. So he gives himself energy drinks, electrocutions, drugs, drives very fast, shags and has a blow-job from girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart), and much more, while he searches for Verona. Also starring Napoleon Dynamite's Efren Ramirez as Kaylo and Carlos Sanz as Carlito. I have to say, the ending of the film didn't really loom like it would give way to a sequel, but I suppose Statham blinking counts for something. Anyway, Statham does quite well as the lead, there are some eye-catching set pieces, action sequences, and even a little giggly stuff, but I can see why it is two stars, but it is certainly not terrible. Okay!",Crank
7,ccthemovieman-1,Overdoing The Overkill,2,25 January 2007,"I like stylish movies and I like Jason Statham, so I was enthused about seeing this film. After watching the first few minutes, I could see another ""Snatch"" or ""The Transporter"" or a combination of the two with a little ""Pulp Fiction"" thrown in.But after 20 minutes, I was starting to get disappointed and after 30-some minutes, I hit the eject button and returned the film at the video store. What a piece of garbage! Talk about ""gratutitious."" That's all this is - gratuitous violence, sex, language - all for the sake of style and shock? I guess.The story - if you want to call it that - was that a guy was injected with a poison with no known cure, so he goes after his killer. By the way, this is a ripoff of the 1950 classic ""D.O.A."" but instead of the victim being a good guy trying to catch the bad guys - as that story was - this is just an excuse for a pig-of-a-guy going after worse pigs. The ""good guy"" (Statham playing ""Chev Chelios') has no respect for anybody or anything and really isn't any better than the slimy people he's after. Profanity also loses its impact when you use it every sentence, too. I realize much of this excess of everything is there on purpose. I just don't think it worked. When you overkill things, even on purpose, you can overdo the overkill...and then it's not entertaining.I will say this: after 30 minutes of this pure crap, it made me appreciate much of the other films that are out there.",Crank
8,rmax304823,Not Necessary.,1,29 July 2012,"The movie ""Speed"" must have been a financial success. That's the one starring Sandra Bullock, my supporting player Dennis Hopper, and that handsome guy with the Polynesian first name. It must have made money because ""Crank"" is a kind of gongoristic offshoot. It's as if the writers had sat down over some hi-caf latte and said, ""Look, ""Speed"" made lots of money. It's about a bus that can't travel under 50 miles an hour or it will blow up. How about if we make a movie about a HIT MAN who finds out that he's poisoned and will die in an hour unless he keeps the adrenalin rushing through his body at warp speed? If it worked for a bus, wouldn't it work for a whole human being?"" I shouldn't really be writing this and you shouldn't bother reading it because I wasn't able to get through the entire cartoon. Everything was so fast and loud that I felt my basilar arteries swelling and at one moment I was sure I'd pop a gut.Jason Statham is the grim, poisoned hit man. He look tough, ugly, muscular, and he never smiles. Amy Smart, of course, is always a delight to look at in her own special surfer-girl kind of way.The need to have the adrenal medullae pumping away must have affected not just the writers but the director and editor as well. The camera wobbles like a man fashionably drunk, each shot lasts a fraction of a second, and at times the screen is split not just into two but into four pictures. The musical score pounds us into insensibility.I'll just give one scene, to catch some of the flavor of the piece. Statham is taking a cab somewhere and feels his adrenalin slowing down. So he asks the driver to turn up the heavy metal on the radio. It's not quite enough. Statham begins jerking his body in time to the music, then pounding his head against the driver's seat. The driver, experienced in these things, simply flicks his eyes at the rear view mirror from time to time as his head is banged back and forth, just to make sure this spastic fit in the back seat is self contained and doesn't constitute a threat to his own body. ""Pull over,"" orders Statham.He gets out of the vehicle, runs into a convenience store, and in slow motion begins throwing people about, smashing the glass cases, and gurgling down energy drinks. Then, properly stimulated, he rushes back out to the cab.I think it was at that point that I stroked out and I am now dead. I'd like my carcass donated to a medical school. I don't care which one except that as many medical students as possible, those who are going to dissect my formaldehyded cadaver, look like Amy Smart. May I suggest starting the search in St. George in the Caribbean? All seriousness aside, if this movie didn't exist, it wouldn't have been necessary to invent it.",Crank
9,Tweekums,Speed meets DOA,7,28 October 2009,"This is a fairly mindless action film with its tongue firmly in its cheek. If you are after something serious avoid this but if you want an hour and a half of non-stop action then this is just the film for you.Our hero Chev Chelios, played by Jason Statham, is a hit-man who has decided to give up his job, unfortunately before he can do that he finds himself injected with a strange Chinese drug that will kill him within an hour if he can't keep his system full of adrenalin. In order to keep himself alive long enough to find a possible antidote and get revenge on the person who did it to him he must put himself in situations which cause him to produce adrenalin. This includes getting into fights, taking drugs, having sex in a crowded street and stealing a police motorbike.I found the film to be fairly entertaining, Jason Statham did a decent job in the lead roll and Amy Smart was appealing in the role of his girl friend. The bad guys were all fairly hammy but in a film like this it doesn't really matter, all they have to do is snarl, act tough then die. Due to the violence, sex and swearing it isn't a film that is suitable for children but adults seeking some mindless action could do a lot worse than this.",Crank
10,BA_Harrison,Arrrrghhh! Sensory overload is hurting my brain...,2,28 February 2007,"Hit-man Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is having a crap day; he's been injected with synthetic poison which will kill him if his heart rate drops. But before he dies, he intends to get revenge on those responsible for his predicament.Five minutes into Crank and I knew I was going to hate it. The glut of directorial gimmicks and camera trickery that pervaded every moment of the opening scene sent alarm bells ringing in my head; this movie was going to be annoying in the extreme.Rather than structure their film carefully and thoughtfully, directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor utilise every MTV-style editing trick in the book in the hope that the audience will be so stunned by the visuals that they won't cotton on to how crap the film really is. This sort of rubbish may impress may ADD afflicted teenagers who know no better, but it doesn't wash with me.With split screens, CGI, staccato editing, bleached film stock, rapid zooms, freeze frames, and novelty subtitles, it's like the film was made by Tony Scott on amphetamines. Jason Statham may be one of the best action stars to have emerged in recent years, but even he cannot save this turgid mess from being the total wreck that it is.On second thoughts, maybe this film is SO dumb and SO over-the-top that it's actually pure geniusthe ultimate violent popcorn thrill ride.No, I was right the first timeit's absolute toss! However it escapes getting the lowest score possible by the skin of its teeth, due to the inclusion of gratuitous shots of Amy Smart's ass, which is divine!",Crank
11,paul_haakonsen,Testosterone and adrenaline in abundance...,8,26 February 2021,"Well, there is just something unique and entertaining about the 2006 movie ""Crank"" that makes this movie one that you can easily watch more than once.Perhaps it is the over-the-top absurdity of the entire movie, from the storyline itself, to the characters and the situations. Or perhaps it is the cast and the acting performances. Or perhaps it is the action and adrenaline - pardon the pun - that flows through the movie. Or maybe, just maybe, it is a combination of all those things.Now, the storyline in ""Crank"" is pretty out there. I mean, a hitman getting poisoned with something called ""The Beijing Cocktail"", where he needs to keep his adrenaline levels pumping and boosted, otherwise his metabolism slows down, his heartbeat slows down and he eventually would drop dead. So former professional hitman Chev Chelios needs to keep going - literally - in order to seek vengeance upon those whom poisoned him.""Crank"" has a nice ensemble of cast, which includes the likes of Jason Statham, Amy Smart, Dwight Yoakam, Efren Ramirez and Jose Pablo Cantillo. Needless to say that Jason Statham perfectly fits into the role as Chev Chelios and it was pure and simply a blast watching him in this particular role and movie.The movie is crammed with action and fast-paced events, so strap yourself in for one heck of a ride. And not only is it an action and adrenaline-packed movie, but there is also a fair amount of well-placed and well-used comedy throughout the storyline.There is a very distinct atmosphere and feel to the movie, that definitely helps set the confines of the movie, and that particular approach of presentation of the movie just worked marvelously.""Crank"" is a trademark Jason Statham movie, no doubt about it. And it is definitely a movie that I can warmly recommend that you watch, if you haven't already seen it.My rating of the 2006 movie ""Crank"" from writers and directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars.",Crank
12,Quinoa1984,"a Grand Theft Auto video-game crossed with a revamp of Speed, it's glorious, stupid Grindhouse excitement",8,16 March 2009,"While the first time writers/directors of Crank said they (very luckily) didn't have to pitch the script, it would have been one of those classic moments seeing that pitch happen: ""Ok, so, it's like Speed, you remember Speed with Keanu Reeves, and he had make sure the bus didn't go below 50 or else it would blow up - here, think of that, only instead of a bus it's an ass-kicking British guy, maybe Jason Statham from Transporter."" It got money thrown at it right away, and Statham had to be actually convinced in reality to take on the part, but it was such a spot-on decision since he is, pleasantly and surprisingly, fit like an oil-slicked glove into the part of Chev Chelios. He's funny because he plays it so straight, even if the movie doesn't.Crank is such a guilty pleasure I should get the Rasputin special for digging it so much. I was reminded of playing those awfully fun Grand Theft Auto games where characters get put into hysterically violent situations, sometimes involving cars and pure energy. But another asset is that the directors are cameramen first, and figure out a real kinetic rhythm to keep things harsh and fast and brutal. You don't need to know much plot at all, as in a video game, except that the main character's been injected with a poisonous ""synthetic"" Chinese serum (aka Chicken Fried MacGuffin as I'd call it), and has to keep his adrenaline going or else he will die. On the one hand this makes it a hardcore revenge flick (watch what Chev Chelios does to the main baddie's brother just to prove his point), and on the other it's one of those to-the-minute flicks that makes 24 look like Mr. Rogers.But, again, the main asset here is that the movie is funny. Not only that, it's f***ing funny. This would fit right in as a double-bill with Shoot em Up (an apt combo if only for two super serious and ""hottie"" Brits in the leads) or even the dreamed-of feature length version of Rodriguez's Machete. It is an action movie meant to play in loads of cineplexes, but it also has a true-blue Grindhouse edge. It's unapologetic in how it treats killing, maiming, punching, gay, straight, sex in public in Chinatown or riding a motorcycle in a hospital gown doing stunts or calling on a cell phone while plummeting from a helicopter. There's nothing that Statham- who may arguably be even MORE of a bad-ass here than ever before (which may or may not be saying a lot considering his 10 year career so far)- won't do for the film, and it works so well because of him and the verve of the film-making.Crank isn't exactly a very ""good"" movie, almost never will you see it on anyone's ""best-of"" list. But damn it all to bloody Hades if you won't want to show it your 20-something buddies after midnight just once.",Crank
13,Coventry,Let's keep that blood pumping to your heart!,7,30 December 2007,"I don't understand a lot of the reviews I encountered on this film. In my humble opinion ""Crank"" is a film that can't really surprise but neither disappoint. If you read or heard what the premise is about, you know exactly what to expect; nothing more and certainly nothing less. The professional and soon-to-be retired assassin Chev Chelios awakes to learn that his rival Verona injected the lethally poisonous ""Beijing Cocktail"" into his veins. Chev has less than one hour to live, but he discovers the fate can be postponed if only the adrenalin-level in his body remains high enough. And what's the best way to keep the heart beating at a high rate? Chev runs amok in the crowded streets of sunny California, deliberately gets in trouble with a troop of black and heavily armed drug dealers, sniffs and shoots up every available type of drugs he can lay his hands on, has sex in public with his bimbo girlfriend Eve and  last but not least  seeks vengeance against his murderer as well as the entire organization he used to work for. Admittedly this isn't the type of subject matter Oscar winners are made of, but it does supply a perfectly fine excuse to depict 80 minutes of hardcore action and politically incorrect situations. ""Crank"" is basically a millennium update of the ""Speed""-concept, but in many ways it reminded me of those rancid & unscrupulous exploitation efforts of the 70's and early 80's. The violence and executions are brutally shown, the portrayal of women is discriminating to say the least (Eve's character mostly doesn't have a clue of what's happening) and there's an overload of crude, racial, sexist and gratuitous humor. Actually, the only elements that reveal ""Crank"" is a nowadays action feature are the modern & hi tech filming techniques. Writers/directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor constantly toy and experiment with hand-held-camera tricks, split-screen images, hallucinatory shots and repeated glimpses at Chev's heart beating inside his chest. The editing appears to have been done with a blender and the stunts are often so spectacular you'll have trouble believing this is actually just a low-budget movie (with estimated financial means of $12,000,000). Most blockbuster action movies can't even shoot one car crash sequence with that money! Jason Statham once again proves that he IS the new charismatic action movie star Hollywood needed so desperately and Amy Smart (although playing a severely inferior role) is seductive as ever. Hell, I think the creators of ""Crank"" reaped exactly what they sowed: an OTT grotesque, demented, not to take too seriously, incredibly campy and easy digestible pulp highlight. Fat chance anyone will remember this film in, say, ten years, but who cares because it's hugely entertaining while it lasts.",Crank
14,michaelRokeefe,What can you accomplish in the last hour of your life?,7,26 January 2007,"Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor write and direct a heart thumping thriller that seems to never quit. Chev Chelios(Jason Statham)is a hit man that freelances on the West Coast. One extraordinary day, he awakens groggy with barely a pulse.

He wants to use that hour saying goodbye to his girlfriend Eve(Amy Smart)and riding the lives of Verona and his gang. Knowing his heart is barely pumping, Chev summons help from his doctor(Dwight Yoakam), who advises that adrenaline alone is what keeps the doomed man alive. If he stops moving, he could die before settling the score and going out with style.Fantastic photography and amazing camera work makes for an instant hardcore action classic. Statham plays his character with abandon. Smart is impressive as the questioning, but sexy girlfriend. Fast paced action is an understatement.

15,hitchcockthelegend,A violent and vulgar distraction.,8,24 December 2013,"Indeed, British magazine Radio Times reviewed Crank and called it a violent and vulgar distraction, maybe so if you be a little prudish and timid of stomach for high octane thrills. Crank is utterly bonkers fun, and it knows it, star Jason Statham knows it, directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor know it, and quite frankly any action movie junkie fan knows it.The tongue is planted so firmly into cheek it is in danger of breaking skin, it's a film that lives to take you on a most improbable thrill ride and succeeds admirably in doing so. Plot is kind of incidental, but Statham has been injected with a Chinese drug that will kill him if his adrenalin levels drop. So off he goes in search of vengeance and maybe an antidote? He runs, he jumps, he snorts drugs, has sex with Amy Smart in public, rides a motorbike like Evel Knievel, flashes his arse a lot and gets a major league erection.He, much like the film, never pauses for breath, it's all very breakneck and kinetic. The makers are guilty of acting like kids locked in a sweet shop, with all the flashy tricks of the action movie trade used wherever possible, but so what?

Chevy is a hit-man who supposedly killed a big Hong Kong gang-lord, and his doing this has made him a marked man. Even his boss, Carlito(Carlos Sanz)has turned his back on him.

Along the way, he must tell his lady love(an adorable, yet sleazy Amy Smart who is wonderful)who he is and that he won't be around very much longer.Run, Chev, Run! Ridiculous from start to finish, this film moves at a highly charged, frenetically energized pace. Not believable for a second, you can barely catch your breath as Statham moves from one situation to another. The film is visually wild with lots of camera tricks to make Chev's situation a loony as possible. The film moves like a jackrabbit on crack. It is also ultra-violent submersing us into gang-land theatrics. Full of unsavory characters and even Statham himself is shady. You root for him because the others are just slimier.

Chev embarks on a high speed chase to get back at the gangsters who put him in his position, while being forced to reveal to his air headed girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) that he's been lying from day one about what he does for a living.""Crank"" is patently over the top nonsense. Writing & directing team Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor style their movie like an all out assault on your senses, with a LOT of quick cutting, sped up action, visual tricks, and hyperactive camera work. Sometimes this gets annoying, but when the filmmakers are able to reign themselves in a bit, they succeed at creating an entertaining, gimmicky thrill ride. It's ridiculous from the word go, but at least it's never boring. The pacing is frequently frantic, there's violence aplenty, and the movie even has an offbeat sense of humour. (An aggressive bout of love making is played for laughs.)Statham never has been a truly great actor, but he does have an undeniable screen presence. The gorgeous Smart is appealing as the girlfriend. The villains are a loud, stereotypical, cartoon like bunch: Jose Pablo Cantillo as Verona, Carlos Sanz as Carlito, Jay Xcala as Alex. Country singer Yoakam does a typically solid job as the doctor who's obliged to talk Chev through his situation long distance.This is 88 minutes worth of insanity, never stopping for much of a breather.

18,poolandrews,Entertaining enough action flick.,6,18 April 2009,"Crank is set in Los Angeles where Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) lives & works as an assassin, however lately he has fallen in love with Eve (Amy Smart) & wants to give up the assassin business & settle down with her. Chelios wakes up one day to discover he has been given a synthetic drug nicknamed an 'Asian Cocktail' which will kill him within an hour & the only thing that slows the drugs progress is adrenaline so Chelios figures out that he has to keep himself stimulated by loud music, violence, drugs & sex to keep his adrenaline levels as high as possible in his body. Chelios is on borrowed time, there is no antidote & he will die sooner or later & before he does Chelios sets out to get revenge on those who poisoned him...This English American co-production was written & directed by Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor this film certainly doesn't take itself too seriously & is the epitome of big, loud, dumb, fast paced & is full of gratuitous sex, swearing, drug use & violence in which it takes great pleasure in it's excessiveness. I must admit that I actually quite liked Crank mostly for it's excessiveness rather than anything else, the public sex scene is a real hoot as are some of the one-liners & shoot-outs. That's pretty much what Crank boils down to, if your after some mindless guy's action film then you could do a lot worse than Crank but if your looking for a film with some meaning or deep character's or profound message then Crank definitely isn't for you. To be honest sometimes a film doesn't need to be anything more than big, fast paced, dumb & full of action does it? The character's are OK, Chelios is quite likable as is his dumb blonde girlfriend Eve although the bad guy's are all stock cardboard cutout clichés. There's absolutely nothing wrong in enjoying a film such as Crank which is fairly shallow & in all honesty doesn't have a lot to it. The basic plot is quite cool & surprisingly original with Chelios having to keep himself pumped up so the adrenaline keeps flowing but that's just about all there is to the film & it doesn't really go anywhere beyond that basic premise. Also I have to say that the question of 'why didn't they just kill Chelios rather than poison him?' kept going through my head while watching Crank & after it had finished I still didn't have an answer. I also think that Chev Chelios is one of the coolest & greatest names of all time, period.Crank has a very modern somewhat comic book feel to it, there's split screen, loud in your face music, macho posturing with scenes set up & shot purely for the cool factor, all sorts of fancy editing, colour tinting & camera angles that give it a rather cool look throughout. The action scenes are decent enough but maybe could have been better, there are some shoot-outs, a few fights & a couple of car chases but nothing that memorable. The ending is outrageous & I didn't quite know how to take it but I suppose it's in keeping with the films somewhat comic book feel throughout so it's not entirely out of place I suppose. There's plenty of violence here & some gore including a chopped off hand, some gory gunshot wounds including someone getting their fingers shot off & someone's hand gets stuck in a sewing machine & gets sliced up.With a supposed budget of about $12,000,000 this was shot in Los Angeles & has flashy production values & that Hollywood polish to it. The acting is alright for this type of film, Jason Statham once again plays a fairly likable wise-cracking English guy while Amy Smart provides the glamour.Crank is a film to just watch for the entertainment value, there's nothing deep or meaningful here but it passes 90 odd minutes harmlessly enough. A sequel Crank: High Voltage (2009) opened around the world yesterday (in relation to when I wrote this comment, obviously) & looks like more of the same from the trailers.",Crank
19,dbborroughs,Guilty pleasure thrill ride of a movie is a blast while its on but doesn't amount to much when its over,7,23 September 2006,"If you like action see this movie.If you like films that are technically brilliant with a dynamite sense of music, see this movie.If you like smart ass cool movies see this movie.If you don't mind feeling very guilty for liking a popcorn film see this movie.The plot is that a hit-man has been poisoned with a drug that will kill him in one hour. He can buy more time if he keeps the adrenaline flowing so our hero begins an all out smash 'em shoot 'em race 'em rush to find the poisoner so that he can send him to hell first.It doesn't get any deeper than that its simply action for actions sake as the film crew dazzles us with their technical brilliance. Its an amazing achievement that dazzles the eye and the ear. The plot is constructed in such away that it grabs you at the start and just drags you along. If nothing else the films wild twists and turns keep things from ever getting dull. Of course little of it makes any real sense but you really won't care as you're carried along.The only real flaw was that the films form over substance construction left me feeling empty at the end. Its clear at the start what the ultimate outcome is going to be so there isn't going to be any wiggle room. The films break neck pacing also leaves no room for anything other than the the most basic of story. Clearly this in intentional but I really did wish there was just a bit more to it. It does leave you wanting more.Its best described as a cinematic roller-coaster thats a fun ride while its on (when it probably will have you swearing its one of the best films of the year) but in the end its a bit disappointing, like when you pull into the station and have to get out of the car. That said this is a must see movie for anyone who loves action flicks.",Crank
20,zardoz-13,The Most Jacked-Up Joyride of All Joyrides!,9,10 May 2009,"Freshmen writer-directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's helter-skelter cartoonish actioneer ""Crank"" qualifies as a violent, live-action, R-rated equivalent of the Energizer bunny battery commercial with agile ""Transporter"" star Jason Statham displaying amazing resilience as he rants and raves across L.A. on a mission of vengeance to kill the villains that are trying to kill him. Neveldine and Taylor have penned and lensed an audaciously original, first-person style, shooter video game melodrama. ""Crank"" will literally nail you to your seat with its runaway plot that updates the venerable Edmund O'Brien death-by-poisoning thriller ""D.O.A."" (1950) with a nod to Jan De Bont's ""Speed"" (1994) where a bus wired to blow up will remain intact as long as the driver doesn't slow down. Nevertheless, despite its homages, ""Crank"" amounts to an entirely unusual exercise in energetic, Dutch-tilt camera angles, enlivened considerably by its maniacal meth-head editing, Atari-video game graphics, Google map search inserts, and a gallery of truly warped minority characters. From the first frame to the last, Neveldine and Taylor ignore gravity and accelerate this epic into overdrive with gleeful abandon.A cold-blooded professional hit-man, Chev Chelios, intends to quit the paid assassin gig so he can live the quiet life with his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart of TV's ""Smith"") who thinks that he earns his living as a video game programmer. Sadly, Chev realizes to his chagrin that he has picked the wrong day to pursue the straight and narrow. Our agile antihero awakens to discover that a vile Asian mobster has injected him with a lethal dose of synthetic 'sci-fi' Chinese poison. Indeed, Chev watches with incredulity on his big-screen television a DVD that nefarious Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo of ""Shackles"") made for him that shows the dastard administering a hypo of the deadly toxin to him in his bedroom the previous evening. Chev brought this all on himself because he iced an Asian mobster Don Kim (Keone Young of ""Dude, Where's My Car""), but the surprise is that Chev didn't whack Kim. Meanwhile, Ricky boasts that Chev has no more than an hour to live. Chev destroys his television in a fit of rage and leaves a message for his disreputable doctor, Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam of ""Sling Blade""), to call him back before an hour elapses.No sooner does Chev discover his predicament than he hits the road in search of Ricky. He calls his transvestite friend Kaylo (Efren Ramirez of ""Napoleon Dynamite"") to put the word on the street that he is looking for Ricky. Next he storms in to see an African-American gangsta, Orlando (Reno Wilson of ""Fallen""), who he believes is associated with the infamous Ricky, only to learn that Orlando is looking for Ricky himself to collect $7, 500 that the Asian owes him. Chev snorts some blow from Orlando and tears off in his car. At the Las Vegas airport, Doc Miles rings Chev up and listens to his description of the poison: ""The flow of adrenalin is what's keeping you alive,"" Miles explains. ""You've got to keep moving, Chevy,"" he adds. ""If I'm right, they gave you the Beijing cocktail."" Miles continues with his diagnosis. ""It works on the adrenal gland, blocks its receptors. The only thing you can do to slow it down at all is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant. Meaning, if you stop, you die."" During this vital expository passage, Neveldine and Taylor don't slow down the action. Instead, the entire conversation occurs while the L.A.P.D. chases Chevy who crashes into a shopping mall to elude them and smashes through it with reckless abandon until he slams into the escalator and bails out for a cab. As cops swarm the mall, Chev rides off in the cab, plotting his next move. He gets the cabbie to stop at a convenience store where he pilfers a supply of energy boosting,over-the-counter medications and chugs a Red Bull.Chev takes a plunge with another gangster, his boss Carlito (Carlos Sanz of ""Backdraft"") who operates a West Coast crime syndicate, in his penthouse swimming pool and plies him with questions about Ricky Verona. ""There is no antidote,"" Carlito gives Chev the bad news. ""Honestly, you should be dead already. It's a miracle."" Carlito laments Chev's hit on Don Kim. ""The heat from Hong Kong has been more than we anticipated."" An unhappy Chev stomps away, commandeers the cab and receives another phone call from Doc Miles. Miles explains that the Beijing cocktail "". . . is cutting off your adrenaline. Excitement, fear, and danger, it causes you body to manufacture chemicals called ephedrine. Now, what these guys have done is introduce an inhibitor to his your system. Dude, your only chance is to massively increase the level of ephedrine in your body to force out the inhibitors."" The funniest scene follows with our anti-hero terrorizing a hospital for anything to keep his heart pumping at ninety to nothing. Initially, a pharmacist won't give Chev any epinephrine and alerts hospital security. While this is transpiring a bystander informs him that nasal spray, which contains epinephrine, will ""tweak"" him. Security pursues Chev through the hospital. He changes into a hospital gown and at gun point forces an EMT to jolt him with a defibrillator.Eventually, Chev kills Ricky's brother by chopping off the thug's fist with a meat cleaver and then using the guy's own gun, still encased in his fist to blow his head to smithereens like a burst watermelon. Now, Chev has to keep his girlfriend Eve out of harm's way and kill Ricky.""Crank"" amounts to the most jacked-up joyride of all cinematic joyrides. Jason Statham was born to play Chev Chelios and Amy Smart is ideal as his dumb, blond girlfriend. ""Crank"" features a plethora of bloody violence, profane language (as many as 115 f-words), low-life sexuality, and rampant drug abuse.",Crank
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Thrillride,7,28 April 2011,"When Chev Chelios wakes up, he is *not* feeling good. He soon learns that he's been given the Beijing Cocktail, and he will die his heart will slow down and eventually stop. As long as he keeps his adrenaline flowing, he won't expire. Maybe he can't keep this going for long but all he needs is enough time to take revenge on the men responsible for his death. This mainly aspires to be thoroughly intense and offensive, and it succeeds pretty well in both. There are a few sequences where it slows down briefly, and since this doesn't build up that much, these don't amount to heightened emotional impact. On the other aspect, this has a trans person, stereotypes(racial and otherwise) for all characters, and nearly any female you see in this is or will be objectified. This is leave your brain at the door entertainment and you will forget much of it pretty soon after. The less than 90 minute running time flies by, and it is rather enjoyable when it plays, as long as you take it at face value. It's simplistic, and yet surprises you(and you'll want to pay attention). There is some visual flair to this, without it being excessive. Acting is fine. The humor can be pretty crude. The dialog has its moments of being quotable, and the action is creative and memorable when it really works. There is strong language, bloody, brutal, at times gory violence, disturbing content, nudity and overt sexuality in this. The DVD comes with three trailers. I recommend this to any fan of this kind of flick. 7/10",Crank

Mexicans). Natch, Chev is hell-bent on living and living to kill Verona and his crew for killing him. In hot pursuit of the evil thug, Chev calls his doctor, Doc Miles (Yoakam having fun and seemingly to channel Dr. Hunter S. Thompson to boot!), for help as the good doctor is whoring it up in Vegas and making a return trip to LA, explaining to his patient that the only thing apparently sustaining him alive is adrenaline and Chev invests himself with some inventive and ugly methods including taking on a gang after snorting coke off a nasty bathroom floor; chugging Red Bull in an impromptu convenience store robbery; finding his girlfriend Eve (Smart who is truly dumb for taking this degradingly awfully stupid role) and proceeding to rape her in Chinatown among some several dozen gawking passersby (arguably the most ugly moment in recent silver-screen history); and stealing a motorcycle cops chopper after visiting the hospital for an electric- paddle re-charging (!)The moronic and hateful storyline was concocted by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor who co-direct as well, showing both having little insight into what makes a true action film tick: a compelling plot, a sympathetic protagonist, a feisty female lead and a trustworthy side-kick; a shrewdly evil villain; and some migraine-less editing would all be nice.

23,evanston_dad,Worthless,1,12 December 2008,"""Crank"" is 50 minutes of some of the worst film-making I have ever seen.Why 50 minutes, you ask, when the film's running time is 87 minutes? Because that's all I could get through before I gave up on a piece of trash that didn't even deserve that much of my time. There are hundreds, nay thousands, of films out there that I'd like to see, and life is way too short to waste on something like this.I can't believe anyone save the most imbecilic of gangster thug wannabes could enjoy this film. I kept picturing a bunch of square suburban white kids watching this in their parents' basement and giggling over how naughty it is. The film is self-concsiously envelope pushing in a juvenile sort of way, and it tries for a tone of outrageous humor that's painfully tortured. But there's absolutely nothing funny -- and much that is actually quite disturbing -- about many of the scenes that are played for laughs, like an inexplicable one where a bad guy is getting a blow job while feeding pieces of raw meat to angry dogs, or another where Jason Statham's character pretty much rapes his girlfriend in the middle of a busy market until she's so turned on that she joins in voluntarily.Garbage.Grade: F",Crank
24,Uriah43,Too Much Action and Profanity,5,17 March 2017,"""Chev Chelios"" (Jason Statham) wakes up in his apartment and finds out that he has been given an injection of a special Chinese drug known as a ""Beijing Cocktail"" which essentially acts as a poison by slowing his heart down until death eventually ensues. So in order to survive he has to stay as active as possible while simultaneously seeking out a drug dealer named ""Ricky Verona"" (Jose Pablo Cantillo) who did this to him in the hope that he might have the antidote. Yet at the same time he also needs the help of his new girlfriend ""Eve"" (Amy Smart) but doesn't quite know how to tell her that he got into this situation because he is a hit-man for the mob. In any case, Chev is in serious trouble and he can't afford to rest or slow down as long as this poison remains in his system. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I have conflicting opinions about this film. For starters, I don't generally care for movies that consist of action at the expense of everything else--and this film certainly has a lot of action. However, given the the fact that this film is based on a video game along with a plot that requires the main character to keep active, I suppose this is one feature that simply cannot be avoided. Likewise, I don't especially care for films that are laced with profanity from start-to-finish and this film has that as well. But again, Chev isn't exactly a person who mixes well in polite society. So given that fact the low-class vocabulary is also probably justified to a certain degree. However, what really annoys me the most is the plethora of films made in this day and age which confers special powers or attributes to the main character out of all semblance to reality. That said, if the directors (Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor) felt it was so necessary to use crude language and humor to capture a sense of realism--then they should have kept everything else as realistic as possible too! Otherwise, they should have put a cape and costume on the main character and been done with it. At least that way it doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. Now, having said that, allow me to say that there were some pretty good action scenes in spite of the criticisms just noted. Again, the action was crucial to the overall plot of the film and so it was justified to a large degree. Hence my conflicting opinions toward this movie. But in any case, I believe it would have been much better if some of the language and sexual scenarios had been toned down a bit. That being the case I have rated this movie accordingly. Average.",Crank

He immediately springs into action to keep his heart pounding resulting in a car crash on an escalator, a hilarious public sex scene that has to be seen to be believed, and a questionable violent conclusion that proves that directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor are attempting to rise above action clichés with a wink. Statham delivers a hilarious performance as he struggles to maintain his heart rate while seeking revenge. His final scene is a great punch line consisting only of a blink of an eye, but it is a second to be savored. Amy Smart plays his dumb blonde girlfriend whose public sex scene with Statham is among the film's biggest laughs. Her appearance seems unnecessary but it works to comic effect. Flat supporting roles by Efren Ramirez as a gay street contact sought by Statham, and Dwight Yoakam as a doctor for the mob. Jose Pablo Cantillo plays a criminal rival to the Statham character and that is about it for him. Fast paced action that never quits once Statham is off and running, but it also works tremendously as a comedy as well.

27,FlashCallahan,Juice me.....,8,17 August 2014,"Chev Chelios is an assassin working for the West Coast crime syndicate. But things are about to get very bad, when he learns he has been injected with a poison called ""The Beijing Cocktail"" by his rival, which will kill him if his heart rate drops. Trying to stay alive and seeking help from friend, Kaylo and Doc Miles, and to keep his heart pumping, Chev sets out to find answers as well as protecting Eve his girlfriend.But his ulterior motive is to get his revenge on those who have betrayed him before the poison kills him......It's as high concept as high concept can get, and I'm sure the pitch by Neveldine and Taylor was, 'it's Speed, but in the human body'. And the reason why it works? It's because its way over the top, bonkers, and constantly winking at the audience.In anyone else's hands, this would have been a straight thriller, directed by Tony Scott (RIP) and starring Denzel Washington. Sure, it would have had the stark visuals, but it wouldn't have that element of absurdity this film has.And this is the films winning formula, absurdity. Referencing retro video games, and unsubtle hints and GTA, crank is 'cranked' up on all scales, from acting, soundtrack, narrative, visuals, and of course Statham.Never before has he starred a film that could not have had anyone else in his role.So all in all, you'll either like this film or hate it, but you'll definitely experience it....",Crank
28,gradyharp,"Blood, guts, mutilation, speed chases: CRANK tops them all!",8,11 January 2007,"Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor may be fairly new at the game of writing and directing as a team, but if CRANK is any indication of what they can do, they probably have the genre sewn up! Definitely not a film for the squeamish or the easily offended by potty mouth dialog, CRANK delivers its own brand of breakneck action and very funny comedic outtakes into a platform for the likes of Jason Statham, so well remembered for his role in Transporter/s, and a cast that gives him fine support.Chev Chelios (Statham, in fine fettle but oddly keeping his shirt on to for once cover his physique...) is a contract killer who has just snuffed a man the local drug dealers in LA are not happy about: relationships between LA and Hong Kong have been strained. As a result one peppy bodybuilder hunk named Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) injects him with an adrenaline-blocking drug that gives Chev only an hour to live. And thus starts the action: Chev must find medication or an antidote within the hour or he will die. Chev informs his girlfriend Eve (gifted comedienne Amy Smart) of his crisis but Eve is so ditzy she doesn't comprehend, leaving very little brain cell action to help Chev. The story is a bit shallow but that really doesn't get in the way when the purpose of the movie is to see just how violent and how many kills and disasters can be created before the final bizarre ending.Statham and Smart make a great team, giving some of the best humor imaginable in a story that is basically humorless. Good casting here. But also the actors who portray the ancillary parts - Cantillo as the embodiment of buff evil, Efren Ramirez as Chev's reliable ally, Dwight Yoakam as his disjointed doctor, Carlos Sanz as the head bad guy, Reno Wilson, Edi Gathegi - are finely directed by this team of Neveldine and Taylor, making sure that there is just enough parody and gag lines to keep our minds active during the barrage of mayhem. You have to like action thrillers to watch this one, but it is one of the better flicks of its kind to come out in a while! Grady Harp",Crank
29,The_Void,"Unfortunately, Statham isn't enough to save a weak thriller with no plot",5,18 January 2007,"Damnit! I went into Crank with slightly higher expectations than I usually go into modern films with because, despite the fact that it obviously borrows heavily from 1994's Speed, the plot provides a great opportunity for an adrenaline fuelled thriller and with possibly the best action star of the minute on board (that's Jason Statham), the result really should have been better. Now don't get me wrong, I didn't go into this film expecting anything life-affirming, but the plot is so obviously just an excuse to have Statham's hit-man character running all over town that it almost hurts. Plot isn't necessarily important in a film like this; but a thin and frankly silly premise really needs something to fall back on, and Crank doesn't have that. The premise involves Statham's character waking up in a room with a television. The man on the screen shows him a film of him being injected with something Chinese and synthetic, and he soon learns that the substance cuts off his adrenaline, and the only way for him to survive long enough for revenge is to engage in a series of adrenaline-pumping action stunts.The film was obviously intended to appeal more to ""street-wise"" rap fans than serious cinema fans like me, and that's a shame as any chance of atmosphere or character development is thrown out of the window in favour of a dumb soundtrack and a lot of (I would say un)cool ""characters"". Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor seem keen to show Statham's fractured state of mind, and the flashy cinematography is good in that it does this; but it's not long before they take it too far, and it soon seems like he's simply stoned rather than suffering from what he's supposed to be suffering from. The stunts range in quality; the initial police chase through a mall sequence is decent, but then they get progressively sillier; culminating in Statham sticking it to Amy Smart in a public place. Jason Statham really is the only positive element of this film - he looks 'ard throughout, and even manages to make one of those silly nightclub shirts look cool. However, his performance isn't enough to save the film - the eighty minute running time shows that the people behind it had a good idea and nothing else, and that's a shame because Crank could have been really good.",Crank
30,zetes,Way better than you're probably thinking it is,8,9 July 2007,"Wow, this is surprisingly excellent. I mean, it's crap, but it's good crap, and that's worth a lot. The premise is basically Speed meets D.O.A. (the 1950 movie starring Edward O'Brien). Jason Statham (of the Transporter movies) is a hit-man who has a lethal Chinese poison coursing through his veins. If he slows down, if his adrenaline level drops, he drops dead. In his last moments, he rushes to find his killer and others responsible, snatching as many energy drinks and drugs as he can get his hands on along the way.

31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Crank,8,4 November 2006,"Just so you know, I'm a fan of Jason Statham, but before you jump to conclusions that I'm gonna give a positive spin on Crank because I'm a fan boy, do note that if you cannot stand mindless action movies, if you're not a Statham fan, flowery vulgarities are not your cup of tea, and MTV styled quick cuts give you headaches, then forget it, Crank is not for you.Otherwise, you're in for an adrenaline pumping ride. And what a ride it is. While Statham has been in a variety of movies, sometimes in bit roles (Collateral), or sharing the limelight (The Italian Job remake), or playing villainous characters (like Cellular), he does prove at times that he could carry off his own vehicle (pardon the pun) in films like the Transporter series. You may quibble about his acting, or the movies he starred in don't allow any range to be seen, but hey, this dude's got presence. And in action movies, that's what matters. Can he be to this decade what Stallone-Van Damme-Schwarzeneggar have been to theirs?Statham stars as Chev Chelios, an unsavoury character, a professional hit-man finding himself in deep, deep trouble. As always, the bad guys like monologues, and slow deaths, hence right at the start he's injected with a synthetic drug known as the Beijing Cocktail. To survive, he must keep his adrenaline flowing and heart rate high. Relaxing and taking five, will be lethal. So begins a riotous run around town, staying alive with every conceivable adrenaline pumping ideas based on sex, drugs and even rock and roll, in his desperate quest to fish out his perpetrators and exact his brand of violent justice.It's extremely non politically correct, and the dialogue, well, you'll either love it, or loathe it. And directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor really loaded this movie with plenty of smart alecky effects and quirky edits, you'll need some time to adjust to the style imposed. Don't go looking for a very smart storyline with award winning acting, because you won't find any, given the very blatant loopholes in certain scenes, plunging plausibility right down the drain. But who cares, so long as the action's great and the pace just never letting up. Best part is that given the local rating, nothing's being censored, so you can see every gory scene (some reminiscent of Hostel, Saw, and the likes), witness sexploitative characters, and hear every swear word in its full glory.And another plus points for the male audience, Amy Smart stars in a decorative role as Eve, Chev's main squeeze, who doesn't show up until close to the hour's mark in a less than 90 minute movie. The character's here plainly to serve up and fulfill deep dark sexual desires. Heck, I'd bet most in the audience were crossing their fingers for some major wardrobe malfunction!Strictly for the fans, and hell yeah, it's one heck of a ride! And stay tuned until the end of the credits too! Can't wait for his new movie Rogue where he goes up against Jet Li!",Crank

First off I can understand where the director was going with the way he made the film because of the fast pace the character was going through, he wanted us to feel that too, so that wasn't my problem. The plot was actually good, but I felt like it wasn't presented too well and the ending was a bit strange. The acting was OK, it just seemed like a bunch of guys... well... they were just being guys.Chev is a former hit man who has been poisoned by his former boss with a Chinese formula in which if he doesn't keep his blood going and his heart rate up, he will die. So in an attempt to keep his heart at a fast speed, he is going on a rampage through L.A. and trying to get to his former boss to get the antidote to cure him. Chev also needs to get to his stoner girlfriend, Eve, before she gets killed; but time is running out as he tries to keep his blood running and his adrenaline going.Like I said, this was an alright action film, I think it was just a little bit too much for me. I still don't understand a good rating here on IMDb because the plot was just a little too wacky, not to mention how many unbelievable situations there were. But I think we sometimes need those films that are a little crazy to believe, so it's all good. Well, I don't think I would see this film again, but to those who wanna see it, you're going to feel like you are on an acid trip.5/10",Crank
34,thesar-2,A Bit Cranky Was I,3,12 April 2014,"I'm a huge Jason Statham fan. I love his style, his acting, his demeanor, accent and most of all, his fighting. Even the worse movie is good when he is fighting.Well, that's how I used to think. Recently, I discovered the How Did This Get Made podcast, where they (mostly) ridicule movies for about an hour, in the most hilarious panel-style way. My mission was to watch/catch-up on all the movies they did and this included this movie, Crank, it's follow-up and In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale.Those three, and yeah, again, including this one, were utter garbage. I even listed them in order from really bad to the worst. So, that said, comparatively speaking, this is the least offensive Statham outing.Basically, no-good, surprisingly charisma-less, Statham plays (the most outrageously horrible name for any character ever and always reminded me of the breakfast cereal, Cheerios, when his name was spoken) Chev Chelios who must keep his adrenaline up the entire movie until he gets a cure for the poison another baddie injected him with.The entire movie is a blended video game, rave home video, a live-action anime cartoon, obscene music video and snuff film. It's crazy and it knows it, thankfully. If it took itself seriously, I would have liked it even less. But, that didn't mean I bought in on the horrible camera angles, over-the-top lines, action and acting and the extreme madness.I can see where someone might like this sort of insanity, so more power to them. Personally, I like a little more realism and would've liked it if I gave an ounce of sh|t on whether Cheerios lived or not. Or any character for that matter.Okay, I take that back, I did want the Asian(?)/Hispanic(?) bad guy to live. But, only because he was so damn cute.* * * Final thoughts: The ending of this movie was a perfect conclusion for this tale and is the reason I 100% avoided part 2.

35,sol-kay,Cranks up the action,6,11 May 2008,"***SPOILERS*** Hopped up and adrenaline driven remake of the 1949 crime classic ""D.O.A"" has reformed hit-man Chev Chelios, Jason Statham, turn downtown L.A into a battle zone in his mad rush to get the person who time-delayed murdered him.When it came back to the person who hired him Verona, Jose Pablo Castillo, that Chev didn't go through with the hit on Chinese Mob Boss Don Kim, Keone Young, he had Chev apprehended knocked out and shot up with a ""Beijing Cocktail"". The ""cocktail"" being a slow acting poison that will within 24 hours put Chev to sleep forever.Getting in touch with his drug addicted physician Doc Mills, Dwight Yoakam, Chev is told the only way to keep the ""cocktail"" from doing him in is to keep on the move and shoot himself up with epinephrine, an adrenaline supplement, as well as snort lines of coke. Still, Doc Mills tells him, there's no way to stop the poison from eventually doing its job no matter how much coke and epinephrine Chev snorts or shoot himself up with. It's then that Chev decides to wipe out the entire Verona Mob in one last hit before he finally checks out for good.Non-stop action that gets real messy at times with Chev going on a mindless rampage in his mission of revenge against those who murdered him. That fact that Cheve has time, 24 hours, before he's to die makes him far more dangerous, in knowing he has nothing to lose, then he ever was as a top West-Coast hit-man. Not caring about himself or those who have the misfortune of running into him Chev just makes a shambles of everything and everyone he comes in contact with in the film.The movie ""Crank"" even gets a bit, a big bit, pornographic as Chev, needing to keep his heart furiously pumping to stay alive, attacks and rapes his stunned girlfriend Eve, Amy Smart. This outrageous scene takes place right in the middle of a crowded Chinatown street in front of a stunned and shocked crowd of, besides men, women and children!****SPOLIER ALERT**** With time running out and no antidote in sight to save him Chev finally catches up with Verona and the real man behind his now deadly and pressing problems, like dropping dead at any moment, his former boss Carilto, Carlo Sanz. It turns out that Chev's decision to spar Chinese Godfather Don Kim's life paid dividends for him in the end. It was Don Kim and his boys who came to Chev's rescue just as he was about to be iced by Carlio & Verona. This didn't save Chev from his ultimate fate but gave him a chance, after dispatching the Carlito Gang, to get the ride of his life in the final fleeting moments of the movie ""Crank"".",Crank
36,FeastMode,my notes,6,23 July 2019,Fun and ridiculous movie with a ridiculous premise. not meant to be taken seriously at all. i liked that it had a video game style to it. lots of very unique scenes lol (2 viewings),Crank
37,Robert_duder,"This movie is cranked up, on crank and ready to crank!!",8,12 September 2006,"Crank is a risky move for the film makers. It could have really fallen flat with it's manic style of film making, shots jumping and crossing and the MTV video style of the way it's directed. Fortunately for them the way it is directed is only reflective of the story itself which is basically a drug laden trip involving a man who wants vengeance on the man who has poisoned him. We get a small look into the past works of this man and how everything is set up but most of it is one hell of a fast paced trip through the city, all the while purposely needing to keep adrenaline high to stay alive. How can you lose with an action premise like that?? Darkly humorous, edge of your seat, constant action...this is probably one of the most unique and intense action movies you'll see this year, it's brilliantly done.Why Jason Statham isn't more of a top leading action man I don't know. He is one of the best talents to come into the action genre in recent years. He was brilliant in both Transporter films, he's a talented Martial Artist, actor, and has this darkly comic look and style to him. He delivers a brute strength while making you smile and has been the ultimate anti-hero as he is exactly that in Crank. I would have liked to seen him do more actual martial arts in the film but nonetheless he keeps blood pumping and is awesome to watch. The guy is terrific!! Amy Smart plays Eve, his love interest who isn't exactly the brightest bulb but somehow he loves her. Her role isn't huge despite getting semi-top billing but she has a rather controversial outdoor, in public sex scene that must be seen to be believed. Jose Pablo Cantillo is Verona the man that Statham wants revenge on for poisoning him. He comes across as a little bit annoying and more of a petty thug but perhaps that's what drives Statham's vengeance is that he's being taken down by this second string mob guy. Dwight Yoakam is terrific in a little cameo playing Statham's back alley doctor. He doesn't get a lot of screen time but he really isn't great in the role.I have used the work manic a couple of times now to describe Crank but that doesn't really describe it. Manic is an understatement. Both newcomer directors Mark Neveldine, and Brian Taylor really do take some risks in the way they film this. It's dangerously choppy and explosive and the film style could almost be disconcerting but it works for this film. However I hope they realize they won't be able to get away with this in every film and it just happens to be that it worked for this style. Anyone who loves a good action film with high intensity will love Crank!! It's like a drug trip adventure that ends in almost a dark laugh...it's an abrupt yet appropriate ending to all the madness. Check this one for sure because it's one of the better ones at the theater right now. 8/10",Crank
38,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Living life a million miles a minute...,4,9 January 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) wakes feeling a little worse than pretty rough- he feels about to die. He learns that a rival gangster has injected him with a Chinese serum that will cause his heart to stop beating unless he keeps up continually motivated and gets to the cure in time. So begins a desperate, real time race across Los Angeles.Apparently, both directors of Crank are ADHD sufferers who concocted this script together to satisfy America's 70 million sufferers of this condition. I'd only just found out about this before I saw it but had no idea just how evident this would be. Treating vital great film-making (no matter what the genre) ingredients such as character development and coherent narrative flow with utter contempt, Crank zooms along with it's real time premise at 100 miles an hour, zooming from one far out action scenario to another. Rising action star Statham is getting known for appearing in films like this and his very similarly paced The Transporter, only here revelling in far more of the seedier aspects of film, like gratuitous swearing and violence, as well as an explicit anal sex scene with unlikeable love interest Amy Smart (witnessed by children!) that's a little objectionable, even for this hardened action lover. Mind you, in one form or another, there's something for everyone to find objectionable with this morally adventurous film.It's been compared to Speed because of the premise. But it's nowhere near as much fun, and not one I'd want to see again, to be honest. **",Crank

40,bowmanblue,Just don't expect realism,9,3 April 2016,"My friend is a big Jason Statham fan. I said to her, 'You must have LOVED 'Crank' then?' to which she said that – actually – she hated it. Her reason was that it was too 'unrealistic.' So, perhaps straight off, I should warn people that if they're expecting something majorly true to life and realistic then they better move on. Crank is 100% not realistic. There have been numerous parallels to video games (mainly the 'Grand Theft Auto' franchise) in as much as it's stupidly over-the-top, but knowingly so – so that's okay (in my book, anyway).Jason 'The Stath' Statham, plays a hit-man with a name that I can never remember how to spell and, one sunny morning in Los Angeles, he wakes up poisoned by a baddie and with less than an hour to live (but, it's also worth noting that the film's runtime is over an hour and a half, so we know that the Stath is going to last a little longer than his foe intended). However, luckily for our cockney hero (yes, he's not bothering with his faux U.S. accent) he soon figures out that if he keeps his adrenaline suitably raised then he'll be okay (well, not okay, but won't die instantly).So, that's basically the film – Jason Statham runs (literally!) from scene to scene, finding one weird and wonderful way of keeping his heart rate up while trying to track down and kill the person who did this to him (and, if there's a genuine antidote out there, he'll have that, too). And that's where the video game similarities start to ring true. It does seem like Jason Statham is travelling from one 'level' to the next, fighting an 'end-of-level-boss' before moving on to the next. What I'm trying to say is that there isn't much of a story to it, so – again – if you're expecting either realism or an in-depth story then you're looking in the wrong place.Me? I like a film that's totally unrealistic with no real story. Therefore, I loved 'Crank.' Yes, it's totally daft, but it never sets out to be anything other than a completely ridiculous action film that's filmed like a cool 'MTV-style' music video. If it wasn't for the fact that Jason Statham is a sex symbol for women, I may be almost tempted to say that Crank is a 'guy's film.' Either way, it's a type of film that you'll either love or hate. I can't see film critics appreciating it much. You don't need much brain power to 'get' it – just be in the mood for something both action-packed and low brow. This is definitely it.",Crank
41,MLDinTN,an adrenaline rush combined with humor,4,17 February 2008,"Crank is about hit-man Chev whom wakes up and plays a DVD and learns that he has been injected with a Chinese poison.

Robs a pharmacy. Steals epinephrine injections at a hospital. Hooks up with his girlfriend in a public place (quite energetic). And has a showdown with the men whom poisoned him with back up. Amy Smartt plays the bimbo girlfriend with not a lot to do.This action movie is definitely played for laughs. It has more comedy than some supposed comedies out there.

46,Floated2,Stunts of Action Thriller,8,13 August 2014,"Crank marks the feature film of action films slated. What elevates Crank above other high-concept action fare, though, is its politically incorrect sense of humor and overall bent sensibility. Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) has no regard for anyone standing in the way of his survival, which leads to several darkly funny encounters. The film's most talked about (and funniest) sequence revolving around Chev's need to keep his adrenaline going is a public sex scene set in the streets of Chinatown. We then are in aware of what is occurring but we cannot stand to digest.Crank provides plenty of great action sequences. Similar to 2007' Shoot 'Em Up, Crank takes more time for the audience to get to know the characters and develops more of plot. The action scenes showcase Statham's physical skills well. Chev doesn't have the time for such acrobatics. His fighting style is about making sure someone stays down. The highlight of the action sequences is a climatic brawl inside a chopper as it hovers over downtown Los Angeles. Both Statham and Cantillo really did their own stunts as they hang out of a helicopter hundreds of feet above ground. One of the more memorable action finals sequences in recent memory (or of its decade).
As a rewatch 06/10/19' Crank remains one of the better high quality actions films of its decade. With a strict purpose to entertain and have fun, it delivers all around.",Crank
47,johnnyboyz,"It does indeed Crank up the pacing, volume and outrageous content quite consistently; too bad most of it is consistently uninteresting.",5,27 June 2009,"If it's any consolation, Crank was actually quite good fun for about forty minutes. The film knew its place, felt at ease with its premise and actually made us aware that it itself was self aware with a number of action movie-come-angry-male-lead clichés that it delightfully brought up; spoofed and then moved on again without due care. There is a point that it goes off on one, a point that it continues to enjoy itself but we sort of get left behind in the process; a point that sees it realise its actually got to finish what it started and the best way it assumes this can be done is to resume what the genre demands, throw in some sexual content, have a showdown with the villain and generally try to up the ante in explosive and unrealistic content.The trouble with Cank is that it doesn't have a 'plan B', or anything to fall back on. Whereas films of this ilk such as Cellular or the third Die Hard film have a certain degree of substance running just below the cause and effect driven, action fuelled narrative; Crank just about has its premise that its lead's heartbeat must retain a certain level, and that's it. There is no inter-racial banter or co-star to act as one's foil; there is no particularly memorable villain to despise as the leads get closer and closer to thwarting them; there certainly isn't any running commentary in the film much in the vein of Cellular, which meekly explored the role of one's cell-phone in today's contemporary world. We don't even get the would-be-nice character study in Crank like we do in Cellular and its lead: Who is this man named Chev Chelios?; What's he like before he begins his fast, frenetic journey?; How does this journey and the dicing with death change him?; What are his attitudes following said journey? Films like Cellular prove this sort of study can be achieved in these sorts of films; an air-headed, young male adult whom we first see in his comfort zone on the beach with his equally dim-witted buddies and an array of bikini-clad girls around him. He is thrust away from this 'space' and does not return until he learns the importance of life, helping others and after he has come close to death on a few occasions. Crank's lead begins life on his back as this glum looking and hard-bodied character before ending the film on his chest following a stunt right out of a Stephen Chow film. But he is still this battered, hard-bodied character who we've just seen do some pretty incredible stuff and nobody really feels anything in the audience just as nobody really learns or appreciates anything on screen.Indeed, the film is about Chev Chelios (Statham), who one day wakes up to find the enemy, perhaps thankfully, have injected him with a serum called a 'Beijing cocktail'. Chev will be thankful they did this rather than just put a bullet in his head, since the aim is to kill him all the same. The deal/pitch/hook of the film is that if his heart rate drops below a certain number, he dies. Cue manic rushing around to keep the ticker ticking and rage boiling over. Early on, Chelios trashes the TV he first uses to find out his ultimatum, as the bad guys filmed the serum going into Chelios and then burnt it onto a DVD disk for him to see. In a fit of rage, he trashes the TV and DVD; usually I hate it when this happens in a film, when someone's rage boils over to the point they trash the room they're in – it often happens much later into respective pieces, and acts as a sure-fire give-away that the makers have run out of ideas, thus they must resort to the trashing of one's apartment/house to get across an 'angry' persona.Two things: firstly, he probably didn't realise but he'd just trashed the evidence that he was actually injected, and secondly; I'm hoping the script had him trash the TV area because he wanted to keep his heart rate up rather than just because he was mad. Later on; and another play with daft, popular convention; is the scene in which Chelios sticks a gun in someone's face and demands answers in a testosterone fulled, ego driven incident. Again, is he doing this because he's the bland; underdeveloped and stereotypical action lead like he was in 2007's 'War'? Or does he need the adrenaline rush and sense of danger to keep him alive? The film identifies its premise and toys with familiar scenes and clichés, it keeps them within the text, but has fun with them.But Crank cannot hold weight; it's the sort of film that takes inspiration from something like Run Lola Run, in the sense it jumps all over the place; has lots of colour complete with transitions and throws just about everything at the screen it's able to: bird's eye view angles; gross-out close ups of GCI hearts and the jarring and blurry edits it enjoys when the heart rate drops. It's a film in which even the pigeons gaze lustfully at human women as a would-be educated and quite helpful doctor cannot help but retain certain cretinous attitudes towards the women he also sees. Crank is shameless in its crash about, throw away attitude; a film that sees people get seriously injured but never really shriek in pain; a film that seems to enjoy having Latinos and Asians from the Far East as its villains and a film that, oddly enough, kills itself off with a sex scene. If people enjoy it, the it'll be for the pacing and rugged likability Statham brings to the film; for most others, it's a relatively unwelcome distraction.",Crank

50,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Adrenaline-loaded testosterone cocktail,6,3 February 2010,"""Crank"" is a high-octane concept movie that busts out of the gate and never stops. Unlike most adrenaline-junkie action films, however, ""Crank"" justifies its juiced-up rip-roaring wackiness because the movie is actually about someone who needs to keep his adrenaline up in order to live. Not many other ""action porn"" movies can say they have such a luxury -- or excuse. ""Crank"" does fly off the handle a bit under Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's surreal and frenzied direction, but it's a pretty entertaining 90-minute joy ride.Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is a hit-man who wakes up to find an angry rival has injected him with ""synthetic Chinese ****"" that will kill him over the course of time. In his mad pursuit of vengeance, he discovers that keeping his adrenaline up is the only way to stay alive. Good thing, because otherwise there'd be no reason for the drug use, excessive violence or public fornication in this movie. Without that, you're looking at maybe the opening five minutes and that's it.Safe to say, this is a guy's movie. If you're a woman, you should probably avoid it. All the women are objects in this movie save Amy Smart as Chev's girlfriend and even she's supposed to be comically ignorant. The only idea/thought she contributes to this movie is to perform vehicular fellatio on her boyfriend during a high-speed chase. Neveldine and Taylor do a great job creating the sense of an adrenaline rush in their film. It's not merely all the violent content and chases that make it exciting, but the speed of the takes and the variety of angles and techniques. The editing is fantastic. Early on in ""Crank,"" when the film is at its best and really milking its breakneck premise, there's a scene where Chev busts into a gas station mini-mart and stocks up on energy powder and drinks. There's footage that follows him around handy-cam style and then there's mock security cam footage of it too. Cut together it not only looks good but gets across that frenetic style they're going for. There's a lot of interesting divided screen work here too.All is great in ""Crank"" until the second act overdose. After one notable scene in Chinatown between Chev and his girlfriend, everything is pretty much out of control. Everyone wants to kill everyone and Chev has run all over the place by this point. The audience is pretty much out of breath and the Chinatown scene is the film's not-too-literal climax of Neveldine and Taylor's attempt to blend action and hilarity.The mark of a testosterone and adrenaline-driven film is always the amount of unnecessary nipples and exposed breasts. None of them are necessary in this film and there's a decent number. But that's entertainment, just in liquid form inside a tall aluminum can that says ""Friggin' Awesome"" on the label. The lengths this film will go to make you think ""awesome"" or laugh at the outrageousness are great. ""Crank"" is a big bucket of greasy man-ness and you indulge until you've hit the breaking point.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Crank
51,Anonymous_Maxine,"Don't try this at home, kids!",9,30 March 2009,"It's no accident that Crank is named after a hardcore narcotic, and while I don't happen to have any personal experience with it myself, I imagine that if the experience were made into a cinematic version it would look something like this movie. It feels like a fast-paced action movie boiled down to it's basest elements, with pesky things like character and plot development mostly tossed out the window. Or out of the helicopter, whichever looks better with a death metal soundtrack. A lesser movie, however, would have made such a simplified approach feel exploitative and cheap, but Crank gives the feeling that such baggage would only slow things down, which is just contrary to the whole idea. I can respect that. There is no set-up, we are immediately thrown into a life-threatening situation where Jason Statham's character Chev Chelios stumbles out of a daze and finds a video left for him by a Hispanic gangster, who gleefully explains that he has injected a ""Beijing cocktail"" of synthetic something or other. The details are not important, what matters is that he now has an estimated hour or so to live until the drugs cause his heart to stop. The only way to survive, of course, is to keep his heart pounding and the adrenaline pumping through his veins. It's sort of like Speed, except it's his body that can't slow down, not a bus.And basically that's about all there is to the story. The premise is mostly an excuse for Jason Statham to run screaming through the streets (and hospitals, as it were) of Los Angeles with a level of disregard for the law that by itself is enough reason to watch the movie. There is a part of the movie where Chelios is speeding down the street on a stolen LAPD motorcycle wearing nothing but a hospital gown and a gun. Try to imagine a situation which would lead to something like that, and you'll have some idea of what your frame of mind will be like while watching the movie.My only real problem with the movie is Amy Smart's character, who is written stupendously wrong. Chev Chelios is given some minute background as a contract killer for a widespread crime syndicate, sort of like Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in True Lies but without quite so much government backing, and his girlfriend is this air-headed blonde who thinks he's a video game programmer. Chelios is collected and focused even while drugged and on the verge of death. He concentrates a hard-edged anger on his enemies, and his girlfriend hiccups and grins like an imbecile when he tries to get her to get dressed and get out of the house before he drops dead on the spot. ""Are we going on a trip?"" she blurts.You get the idea. Their relationship is so wrong and so ineffective that it probably would have made more sense if she had been cast as his daughter instead. Then again, that would mess up their scene in Chinatown, but I'll leave that for you to find out about.The main villain, a punk gangster curiously named Verona (and yes, he does invoke Shakespeare's name early in the movie), is also wildly overacted for most of the movie, but that's in fitting with the rest of the film. If he had delivered a subdued performance he would have looked totally out of place, like the girlfriend, who really serves no purpose other than to enter the film in her underwear and, you know, the Chinatown thing. There is, of course, some great humor in the movie, which is to be expected in this kind of over-the-top action comedy. It's brutally violent but knows when to slow down for a few laughs, and many of the laughs are real. There is a great periodic interaction between Chelios and his shady doctor buddy, played by Dwight Yoakam, who is out of town and can only help over the phone but who calmly explains while on crowded planes and such that the fire in his chest and his steely erection are perfectly normal for what he's suffering from, but that if he doesn't keep his adrenaline pumping he's gonna die. But for the most part, Crank is a hard boiled action movie that is specifically designed to give directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor free reign to bombard your senses with every little trick they can imagine, which includes split screens, animated views of the pounding hearts of humans and pigeons alike, car chases, gun fights, dazed point of view shots, subtitles viewed from both sides, and even a couple of shots where people that Chelios is speaking to on the phone appear on screen  once projected onto a nearby wall and once, briefly, in a side-view mirror as Chelios speeds down the street.Crank was made with a very specific audience in mind, and for what that audience wants to see, the movie definitely delivers. There will, of course, be plenty of people who will attack the movie for being shallow or exploitative or too violent or for having an ending that didn't wrap everything up in a nice little package or whatever, but the fact that there is a Crank 2 coming up seems to answer the one big question that many people have had about the ending. Personally I didn't see how there was any mystery. The end of the movie fits perfectly with the rest of it. It's totally outlandish and preposterous, but if you don't get a thrill from the last half second of this movie, you missed something.",Crank
52,Vartiainen,Surprisingly addictive - pun intended,7,19 September 2021,"Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), a hitman for a LA crime syndicate, gets injected with ""something Chinese"", a drug that will eventually stop his heart unless he manages to keep himself in a perpetual state of adrenaline rush. Thus motivated he rushes out of his apartment to find the ones who injected him in the first place.This is exactly the kind of bonkers idea I love for my B action movies. It also helps a lot that they managed to get Statham to play the lead role. His ability to pull off slightly crazed yet effortlessly cool is unparalleled and there's just something about his gruff demeanour that's endlessly entertaining.As you might have guessed, this is a very high octane film that never stops moving. Yet it never becomes too exhausting. Chelios switches his means of keeping himself excited enough that it doesn't become repetitive and the world he inhabits is interesting enough that simply moving around in it, chasing his killers, would be enough in an on itself.If I had to criticize the film, I'd be forced to admit that I could have used a bit more clean-cut resolution to the story, but even the one we got wasn't bad.

That boosts all the hormones in everyone's body. Forget the Viagra! And the killer's brother had a death grip on that .44 Magnum Auto, after Chev hacks it off. Talk about lending a hand. Keeping it(the poison) in check took a lot of effort: the drugs, the sex, running, energy drinks, the nasal spray, the shock treatment. Chev was on a roll. Very intense, very energetic, the movie ""Crank"" lives up to its name. Great! Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",Crank
54,Chris Knipp,Let's get cranking,6,5 September 2006,"""Crank"" is the last gasp of 2006's summer popcorn movies, a story about a powerhouse hit man assigned to kill a Chinese gang leader who gets fed some Chinese poison that cuts off his adrenalin and will cause him to die. John Stratham -- who got his start (after the UK Olympic swimming team and fashion modeling) in those arch little Brit noirs Guy Ritchie made -- is the hit man, and many absurd and violent scenes follow as he tries to track down enemies and get his doctor (Dwight Yoakum, a cozily sleazy sawbones) to save his own life. In the meantime he has to keep his adrenalin, and presumably ours, flowing by an outrageous series of desperate measures both large and small, ranging from drinking Red Bull from a Seven Eleven whose clerk he's just mugged all the way through smashing his own hand in a hot waffle iron; taking some Haitian potion offered by a cab driver; snorting coke off the floor of a black gangster's den, having sex with his girlfriend in front of a cheering Chinatown crowd; shooting up epiphedrine stolen from a hospital, and driving his own car through a department store and crashing it on an escalator.Not a new theme, this, the man running against death on a poisoned cocktail that makes him violent. All that really new is that there are a lot of cell phones and the visual effects are trickier and more colorful. It's meant to be exciting and/or funny, but it isn't often really either. What it is, is loudly energetic and visually (sometimes) dazzling. Corny though the effect is by now, I liked the bleached-out distressed frames (echoes of ""Spun"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"") used when Chev Chelios (Stratham -- ""Poison in his veinsvengeance in his heart."") shoots up a whole container of epiphedrine and gets super-cranked.. I liked the spiffy, over-muscled gang lord heavies of various ethnicities, among whom Jose Pablo Cantillo stands out: he makes just the cutest muscle-bound baby-faced Latino goon.. And I liked the way one scene seems to be invaded by objects and characters from the scene that's about to follow it, just before it does. Mostly Chev just seems to knock down things and people. But he does give a stunning show of a man on a rampage.At times this movie -- like so many attempts at violent hipness that are free with their language and not concerned with political correctness -- seems like a manic sequence stolen from Tarantino. But it's Tarantino drained of most of his dialogue and all of his cunning plot twists, so that doesn't leave us with much. Content-wise, this makes Wayne Kramer's absurdly kinetic ""Running Scared"" look like Ingmar Bergman.Still, if you don't mind the occasional severed body part; are cool with guys getting beaten to a pulp just off-screen; and want some fast, violent, colorful distraction, this may be a good eighty-three minutes for you.",Crank

Here is one incredible example of his power to entertain. Statham plays Chev Chelios a professional hit man who's latest target has friends. One enemy of his called Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) has put a contract on him and it seems to have worked. The assassin has gotten close enough to inject Chelios with a deadly vial of lethal poison. Now Chelios has only twenty four hours to get help from his friend doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam), find an antidote and kill Verona who has an army to protect him. Indeed, there are many other groups who want Chelios dead and plan on doing him in before the poison does. From first to last, this movie is one action packed film, designed to demonstrate his physical abilities and his extraordinary acrobatics.

He plays Chev, a hit-man at the top of his game, wakes up one morning feels very weak, he discovers he was poisoned. With an hour left to live, he must find something to keep him going, cause if he slows down at any point, his body will slow down and he will die too soon. Will Chev take down the people that poisoned him, or will he die trying? You'll have to see the movie to find out.

57,dfranzen70,"Statham, even faster and furiouser.",7,21 April 2015,"Crank is a riotous piece of work. It's devilish in its simplicity and delivers pretty much exactly what its title and premise promise - a high-octane bundle of testosterone, adrenaline, and nerves that dominate what should have been a wholly unmemorable action movie.Face it, if this had come out in the 1980s, it'd have starred Steven Seagal and an army of indistinguishable villains and damsels. Instead it came out this century, and although Jason Statham is no Mel Gibson, he's also no Steven Seagal. Here, he's notorious hit man Chev Chelios, who's just been poisoned by a rival baddie with a designer drug that will kill him in about an hour - or less, if his heart rate slows down too much. So it's kind of like Speed, only with a heart instead of a bus. Kind of.Chelios is targeted by a guy named Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who's taking revenge for Chelios's killing of a local mob chief. While Chelios is sleeping, Verona manages to sneak in and inject our hero with a Chinese synthetic. He then helpfully leaves a DVD that informs Chelios of his plight.At the advice of his doctor (Dwight Yoakam), who's out of town, Chelios strives to keep his heart rate elevated. He takes cops on a chase through a mall, just like in The Blues Brothers! He parkours! He runs through a hospital! He steals a cop's motorcycle! He has public sex! He's insane! Amy Smart plays his girlfriend, Eve. Eve isn't terribly bright (she has no idea Chev is a hit man) and probably is afflicted by ADD, but she's nice and can be a little dangerous, too. Smart was a, uh, good choice to play the role. Thank goodness Tara Reid didn't get involved here.The pace is frantic, with a lot of racing about on foot and in vehicles. There are slow-mo shots, rapid-fire shots, close-ups of ultra-violence and copious blood. Heck, compared with all of that, the sex scene in Chinatown is rather tame. And Chelios, with poison coursing through his veins, is in vehicular accidents and fistfights galore but keeps on ticking. Why? Because he's Chev Chelios, that's why.Crank is a super-stylish homage to those 1980s action movies, and the stern acting by Statham - wisely letting the comic moments occur around him, rather than trying to actually instigate them - pushes this one over the top. In a good way. Awesome movie for the real action junkies among us.",Crank

When he learns that there is an antidote Chelios realises that getting his hands on the antidote may be his only chance of survival - only catch is that he mustn't let his heart rate drop too low...Crank has been written and directed by the same person and when watching it I did wonder if this film was deliberately directed in a flashy and stylistic manner in order to compensate for the thin story. This isn't meant entirely as a criticism as part of what makes Crank watchable is the very flamboyant style that has been used within the film. The film is energetic and Statham gives his usual tongue-in-cheek performance which makes him fun to watch (he's not the best of actors, but he does give 110% here).Whilst the story is on the thin side, Neveldine does at least have fun with the material (like he knows how silly it all is and is basically laughing along with us). Some things that happen within the film are so ridiculous that they have to be seen to be believed, but I have to admit that despite much of the lunacy I did find large parts of the film to be enjoyable.I've commented on the thin story, but the film does have one or two other weaknesses as well; such as the villains who lack any real menace and seem to be of cardboard cut-out quality and oddly enough the film did seemed to lose a little momentum once Amy Smart's character was introduced to the story (although she is involved in one quite shall we say 'memorable scene)'Crank is one of those films that is good to look at and the fact that it has a sense of humour is another plus, but sadly it is more eye-candy than substance and the end result is something average and watchable, but not exactly heart-stopping.",Crank
59,barnabyrudge,"Soulless action extravaganza, easy to watch and easy to forget.",5,14 April 2008,"Crank is a deliberately stylized and unrealistic action movie, more concerned with outrageous stunts, flashy editing and smart-ass dialogue than any real movie-making merit. It is not a particularly good film, being alternately too dumb for its own good and too nasty to totally be taken on a good-humoured level. But at the same time, its relentless energy and sheer passion for destruction and mayhem ensures that it lives up to its own unambitious goals, and is an action buffs dream.Professional hit-man Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) wakes up one morning to find a disc showing him that during the night he has been injected with a deadly poison. The poison acts by choking his supply of adrenalin and he will be dead within an hour unless he can keep his natural adrenalin levels on a permanent high. Chelios sets out to track down those responsible for giving him the poison, namely rival hit-man Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) and gangland boss Carlito (Carlos Sanz). In order to stay alive, his day becomes a non-stop adrenalin rush  he causes fights, snorts cocaine, drives everywhere at ridiculously high speed (even smashing through a packed shopping mall in his car at one point), carries out a store hold-up, and much more. anything to keep his heart pumping while he seeks vengeance on those that have sentenced him to death. He also attempts to protect his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) from the same enemies. A citywide rampage ensues as Chelios fights to stay alive long enough to avenge himself.Crank is essentially an action remake of the more subtle, mystery-driven thriller D.O.A. The plot is sheer lunacy lacking credibility at all points, though presumably this is intentional. Statham actually does quite well within the restrictions of the role  his hero is abrasive, single-minded and sarcastically witty, though at no point does he become even an outline of a believable character. Most of the other actors have thankless roles, especially Smart as the ditsy blonde girlfriend and Cantillo as the scenery-chewing bad guy. The action is quite cleverly edited, with lots of visual and aural tricks, but an air of soullessness hangs over many of the scenes. There's no real thrill and human spark, just spectacle and expensive destruction. Everything is done with a heavy-handed insistence on style over substance, right down to the film's astonishingly absurd climax which features one of the most surreal death scenes ever seen in a movie. On a more positive note, Crank does at least have a pulsating rock soundtrack to propel the proceedings forward and for all its other flaws one could never label it as dull. Definitely one for hardcore genre addicts.",Crank

This movie is the stereotypical man's dream, graphic nonstop action and violence, nude women, and the ogling of females private parts 24/7. I will say that I think Jason Statham is a pretty good actor, which is why I have no idea why he would choose to star in such a stupid movie! Seriously the plot to this movie is just testosterone, that's all that is. I mean scene after scene after scene shows Jason Statham either killing people or screwing his girlfriend in public why bystanders cheer on. I really hated this movie because there was nothing that convinced me to keep watching, there was nothing interesting AT ALL. First of all, I'm not a prude OK, I can take a lot and I'm pretty liberal about what I watch, but the violence and sex in this movie is just degrading and exploitative. I was seriously just sitting there watching this crap unfold asking myself what the heck am I watching. And to all the men out there who like this movie: why is this such a typical ""guy movie""?? I mean what is so appealing? Is it the constant ANTI-GAY sentiment (uses of f****t). Is it seeing women have no purpose but something to screw when you need adrenaline?? Or seeing a guy's hand get sliced off?? This movie is so low its sad. I'm so disappointed that Amy smart did this movie, she plays such an idiot and there's no purpose to her role other than something to have sex with. The plot is sooo stupid, it's just an excuse for a bunch of crazy insane events to happen. Crank is a piece of GARBADGE!

Jason Statham, who makes the most of the thin material, plays a hit-man who has been injected with a Chinese poison that will kill him fast unless he remains constantly aloof so that his adrenalin levels keep the toxic agent at bay. So far so good. It's a novel action movie premise. Unfortunately, although Statham fights and kills a bunch of people, the film is boring. There is next-to-no characterization and the action staging is often sloppy and matter-of-fact. Unlike the recent and superior ""District B-13"", which boasted some spectacular action choreography and powerful fight sequences, this is cutty, dull nonsense that, thankfully, is fully aware of how ridiculous it really is. As a huge action film fan, I was grossly disappointed.The film is nicely mixed and acted and quite short, but it is sabotaged by repetition and feels like a mish-mash of a hundred other action flicks. The recent ""Running Scared"" was much better, even though it had a soggy mid-section. Final helicopter sequence over LA is the stand-out and the final shot, to be fair, deserves a nod.",Crank
64,TOMNEL,"I get what they're going for, but....",4,17 April 2008,"I understand completely what this movie was going for. The nonstop action scenes were trying to be crowd pleasers, and the constant cuts away to funny expressions and such were meant to accentuate the fast paced action and make it funny. It turned out more corny than anything. Some scenes meant to be funny, were instead laughable that they were even meant to be funny (if that makes any sense).Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is an assassin getting ready to slow down and quit the business to spend more time with his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart). Unfortunately for him, a rival gang leader injects him with a poison that will kill him if his heart doesn't stay above a certain rate. It's an interesting plot, and Jason Statham is actually quite charismatic, but the ""tongue in cheek"" writing is just pathetic. You have to suspend all reality and then some to enjoy the rubbish writing, and you probably still won't be able to stand it. In one scene a lewd act is committed in public, and the reaction was one of amazingly bad overacting, which could be funny, but the fact that they were going for that just made it stupid. The action scenes are about the only good part of the movie, because they are pretty intense and fun to watch, but they too are amazingly stupid. This could've been better, and along with some bad writing, it's also the director's fault for messing this one up.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 80 mins.

Upon playing it he discovers that he has been injected with a Chineese poison that will kill him if his heart rate drops too much. Now, he must keep his adrenaline up in order to exact his revenge on those who poisoned him. Creating havoc in the streets is the only way for him to survive.The concept of Crank seems like a brainless, action film that would have no plot what so ever and bad dialogue. Crank is exactly that, but manages to have fun with the action formula at the same time. Crank takes the old 90's action films, and video games such as Grand Theft Auto and throws it into high gear in under 90 minutes. It's safe to assume that you won't be expecting Crank to win Best Picture at the Oscar's next year and if you go into the film with an open mind, you'll find it to be an enjoyable pleasure that is endless action after endless action. It's just too bad that the film's fast pace take away from the action.Statham plays Chelios and is great for the part, even if it is basically a re-hash of every other character that he does. With stars like Arnold, Sly and Bruce taking a leave from the action genre, it appears that Statham is the next in line to take over. I stated, back when The Transporter came out, that Statham was to be added to the list of names for the next top action star, on that list included Vin Diesel and The Rock. With Crank, Statham manages to jump ahead of the pack, but that may also be credited to Diesel branching off into other directions, Find ME Guilty and The Pacifier. Along for the ride with Statham is Amy Smart, who plays the role of his girlfriend, who doesn't know that he's a hit-man. Smart serves as eye candy and is there basically for Statham to have sex with in the middle of Chinatown. It's to keep his adrenaline up, I swear.The dialogue is pretty bad, one only has to listen to a line like ""Don't pop a blood vessel you little penis."" to start rolling their eyes. Statham is either spitting out bad dialogue or is yelling at objects and people. To accompany this bad dialogue is the lack of a plot. Other then the fact that Statham has been injected with poison and wants to have revenge, there is nothing else in the film. Of course there is the clichéd hit-man wants to leave the game for his girlfriend bit, but it comes out of nowhere and the film goes nowhere with it.The film is juvenile with it's humour, having Statham have a boner because of the shot of adrenaline he took. Crank also has some pretty random comedic parts, such as having c*nt written on Statham for head in one scene and in the last minute of the film, which is basically a parody of the never ending falling you always seem to see in action films. Crank's pace is really fast and it ends fairly quickly, because of this non of the action sticks in your mind as anything special. It doesn't seem as big as it could have been, or wanted to be. Crank is too condensed in it's short time span that the action seems to little, even if that's all the film is about. With no particular scene sticking out in my mind as explosive, the build up to the so called climax leaves us wanting more. The climax of Crank isn't as big as the audience would want it to be and after all the action and build up the first 80 minutes has the last few feels like it's full of hot air.Crank could have been a great action film that was one big explosive scene after the next, but it falls an inch short of that and ends up becoming a joke at certain points. The film is all good and fun indeed, but near the end the fun dwindles away and leaves an empty feeling. All in all it's a something that you can enjoy and possibly have a good time with, but make sure your brain is at home.",Crank

Chev meets his girlfriend Eve and together he looks for Verona to kill him.When I read a plot like this, I expected it to be big, like a huge blockbuster. But you know what Lions Gate is. They are an independent studio but I was still excited to see what they got up their sleeves. When I saw the film, after watching the whole movie, I was disappointed.Okay, the whole look of the film is really fantastic! It was shot really well, and it has a new, fresh, and original look. You really need to give the directors props for that. And with a plot like that, you expect ""an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride"" (commented by Access Hollywood). Well, some might find it a thrill ride but I did not.I did not watch a thrill ride. It did not feel any suspenseful than any animated film, which sadly, sometimes have some suspenseful scenes. I think it would have done better with a bigger budget, with a well-known studio, and that it would have turned into a blockbuster film. That's just my opinion.Well, while I was watching the film, I expected some creative ideas because of the plot (ways to keep your adrenaline up). There were some good ideas, but not anything all that creative. I mean, there's burning yourself, smoking crack, having sex, but is that really all they could do?The action, which I expected to be thrilling or suspenseful, was mediocre. I expected it to be like The Transporter, which, sadly, has better over-the-top action than measly gun shooting scenes. Where's the kung-fu action? Where is the kick-ass Jason Statham?Our protagonist, in my opinion, isn't all that special. I really did not care if he was going to die or not because he was portrayed like a bad person. Who gives a crap (sorry for the bad language) about a bad person who is dying? Still, Statham's acting was well done. Amy Smart's performance was, although she played a clueless bimbo, was decent enough.It really seems that I hate this film but I did not. There were some really over-the-top action sequences, which, I liked. One problem is that there were some action scenes that really took me out of the movie because it was too over-the-top.This feels like a mediocre action film with an extraordinary plot. It could've (or should've) been a lot better, with more creativity, but it did not. Still, I admire its ambition and that it has a whole new look for an action film.

68,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Crank"" a fast paced, clever, and cool-as-Hell adrenaline rush of a film!!",9,2 September 2006,"I walked into ""Crank"" with low expectations, as I do with many films. The previews made it look like it had a clever story, but I was worried that with Jason Statham playing lead, I might just get a re-hash of his ""Transporter"" films.I got a pleasant surprise. From the very beginning, the film moves. And moves damn fast. Not in an obnoxious way either. In the first minutes of the film we are set up with a possible story of corruption between hit men, a botched job, and the set-up for the whole movie-- Statham's Chev Chelios being fatally poisoned with a Chinese-made serum that slows his heart rate, and will eventually literally make his heart stop, killing him. The only solution-- get the adrenaline pumping and keep his heart rate up! The whole movie is like one long action sequence, with pauses for story elements. This is the common thing now in films, but in other movies, it generally doesn't work so well. But, with the premise of ""Crank"" being the need for speed (Literally), the idea of all-action, little-plot actually works. And works well.However, don't be mistaken, there is genuine plot in the film. Clever stories about the pasts and workings of crime-lords and their cronies, and how they all relate to Chelios. Some of it went over my head because of the constant action, but I was able to understand everything enough to enjoy the film.The direction and editing is something I want to talk about briefly before I wrap this up. For a film like this, one would expect flashy camera work and crazy fast cutting, but I must say, the director/writer and the editor went beyond the call of duty. The film is shot as though the cameraman himself was the one who was poisoned, with the camera flashing and moving around nearly constantly, only settling during the slow scenes. Quite a genius use of camera-work to emulate the story. And the editing certainly adds a lot to the already excellent camera work. We get cutting when necessary and when not necessary, to further illustrate the needs of the main character.Overall, I would say ""Crank"" was the coolest movie I've seen in the last several years, leaps and bounds beyond the standard Hollywood action flick. I would recommend to any action-fan or adrenaline junkie, because take it from me, this film is the ultimate rush!",Crank

71,dunmore_ego,Crank-y,6,14 September 2006,"Super stylish. Super amped. Super shallow.Still, any movie that opens with Quiet Riot's *Bang Your Head* scarring the soundtrack can't be all that bad. And writer-directors Mark Neveldine's and Brian Taylor's *Crank* isn't all that bad. It isn't all that good either.A hit-man, Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), has been injected with The Beijing Cocktail, a substance that will kill him if his adrenaline slips below a certain level. To exact revenge on his killer in the 24 hours he has left to live, Chev must stay cranked to the point of his heart almost exploding. Think *Speed* (1994), with Statham as the rampaging bus; think *DOA* (1988, with Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan) without the complications of a plot; stylistically, think a non-thinking man's version of Guy Ritchie's *Snatch* (2001).Statham as the doomed hit-man (and the star of *Snatch*) furthers the likeness to Ritchie's frenetic film; the crash-cutting, insane angles and editing also conjures images of Neveldine and Taylor worshiping at the altar of Ritchie. But that is where the similarities end, for *Crank* is a perfect example of what Ritchie was hollowly criticized for  style over substance.*Crank*'s first ten minutes are so heart-bustingly fast and furious that we don't have time to pay attention to plot contrivances, formulaic acting and slapdash direction. Of course, unless you are very talented  or very crazy (Guy Ritchie answers to both, first making *Snatch*, then marrying Madonna)  that kind of action is unsustainable, or the *audience's* hearts would explode.By the time Chev is headbanging to the strains of *Achy Breaky Heart* (you read that right), we have composed ourselves enough to realize that our suspension of disbelief is on rocky ground - as we think back on the logistical stupidities of what went into igniting this plot: a Latino thug, Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who would as likely shoot you in the eye as gang-rape your mother, injects Chev with the offending heart-stopping substance and is kind enough to MAKE A DVD to explain the scenario to Chev. How very Batman-Villain of him.Telling ourselves ""It's just a movie,"" we run with it, even as Chev is impelled to run through LA streets with a magnum erection thinly covered with a hospital gown that keeps flapping open to reveal his taut buttocks for the laydayz. But the Bond Villain stopgap Methods Of Prolonged Murder attain teeth-grinding proportions and by the final scene, when Chev confronts Verona, we ask ourselves why Verona, an impulsive gangland hitter (who by this stage has gone foaming-mouthed mental over Chev killing his brother and scarfing his bling), does not simply pump Chev full of shrapnel when he is standing there unarmed, surrounded by Verona's gang. Instead, Verona opts to courteously *inject Chev again*, then scream at him to die, with lots of swearing. That oughta help - more so than the GUN Verona carries in his other hand.I don't know whether I was laughing because the movie was genuinely funny, or because I was on that knife-edge of popcorn straight jacket myself Jason Statham has made the transition well from UK Hard Guy to US Hard Guy, insinuating himself into the Los Angeles gangsta kulcha with only a slight doctoring of the Brit accent, his visage simply yelling American street fighting hit-man. His *Transporter* movies only helped.Eve (Amy Smart) is Chev's small-minded strawberry-blonde fluff, about as smart as Jack Nicholson in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* - AFTER the lobotomy; the type who applies lipstick obliviously, whilst in her peripheral vision, Chev beats a prospective assailant without her knowledge Only in LA The sex and violence is heavy duty, brazenly overstepping the boundaries of what the hypocrites call ""good taste."" But good taste  by its definition - is what tastes good. And when Chev brutally bangs Eve in front of a leering Chinatown crowd to keep his heart rate banging'  now that's just plain creamy Christian goodness!The irony is, in trying to keep Chev out of a coma by going hell-tilt, if this movie did NOT overstep boundaries with its passenger-seat blowjobs, hatcheted hands, magnum erections and (literally) hung transvestites, the audience would lapse into coma.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Crank
72,pyrocitor,Overstimulating and offensively excessive to the point of being dull,3,14 April 2009,"One does not generally think of contemporary popular culture in the context of how it will seem in the future until examples come along caving so all-consumingly to fleeting stylistic trends that the notion of it being dated becomes painfully inescapable. Such a case, suffice to say, is Crank. A perfect example of how trends descend to stereotypes, Crank does not dabble in stylistic conventions, but seizes them by the metaphoric throat and throttles them. Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor throw everything from hyperkinetic cinematography and editing to subtitles ferociously flying across the screen (as made famous by films such as Tony Scott's Man on Fire) into the mix and amp up the pace to overdrive, seemingly with the hope that sheer demented energy can make up for such trivial notions as plot. And while the film's single-mindedly deranged determination to have a good time, regardless of political correctness, cohesion or sense whatsoever is vaguely commendable in a ludicrous way, there remains more to a quality film than the sum of its parts, and Crank offers nothing but a collection of disjointed parts, more of a frenzy of noise and lights than a satisfying narrative experience.The key to either enjoying or hating the film lies in the viewer's resolution of two crucial issues: their tolerance for not only not taking the film seriously but bestowing upon it a near divine patience, and whether or not it is read as a satirical send-up of contemporary action cinema. However, giving the film an absurdly lenient benefit of the doubt or not, it still proves an excruciating watch. Rather than suspenseful, exciting and tense, Crank succeeds only at being loud, irritating and excessive in every sense that it proves overwhelming in the worst possible way - the sort of film the viewer is inclined to turn off or walk out of not because it is too effectively intense, but simply because they cannot find it in them to care anymore. While the general premise proves an intriguing hook for an action thriller (Statham's protagonist must keep his adrenaline pumping to keep a poisoned heart beating), the execution becomes infuriatingly gimmicky after a surprisingly brief time, making the film's mercifully brief running time drag to a near intolerable point. Yes the forms of stimulation Statham pursues prove frequently inventive, but such invention hinders rather than helps the film by suggesting the sort of directorial attention to detail which might have helped the film actually come together, or accomplish some form of objective.While the remains something tantalisingly daring about Crank not only avoiding a clichéd moral center, but openly spitting in the face of concepts such as morals, emotions and political correctness whatsoever (misogyny? racial bigotry? anti-establishment? no problem!), a film willing to be so loudly defiant but having nothing to show for it cannot help but feel somewhat redundant. Had the film some form of coherent motivation or at least offered some semblance of originality, its flagrant excesses may have proved more permittable, but as it stands, Crank proves emblematic of the most tiresome form of cultural hodgepodge, stealing from every possible source but merely throwing all its influences into a noisy, wasteful mishmash. While senseless moments such as an innocent bird being blown away and a public near rape turned ecstatic sex scene might potentially have offered a form of gruesome comic relief, as it stands, they merely contribute more noise into the overall din, only serving to represent just how disturbingly self-indulgent the film truly is. And while the last thing a viewer could reasonably expect from such a film would be credible characters or strong acting, the only direction given whatsoever to the cast appears to be to deliver toneless feral bellows in lieu of lines. Jason Statham is the most appealing attribute in the film's frenzied mess, but even his striving for the sort of gravely charismatic lead one desperately wants to like is too loud, frantic and emotionally void, delivering far too much of everything to even remain interesting. Amy Smart is downright embarrassing, setting attempts at gender equality back decades with a distressingly vacant, resoundingly unfunny attempt at unappealing eye candy that goes too far to even function as a parody (which her performance was likely not meant to be). Finally, Jose Pablo Cantillo manages to prove just as racially offensive as Smart's performance was for feminine representation, a screeching, discordant pantomime of villianhood too overblown to take seriously and too senseless to even enjoy as a campy, guilty pleasure. As such, while one can praise Neveldine and Taylor's seemingly boundless courage, their overstimulating, misguided and downright insultingly poor film feels like such a substantial misfire on all counts that even its resounding determination to entertain at all costs appears more scornful than laudable. In the end, Crank desperately wants to be cool and hip, but feels the equivalent of the loud, abrasive and obnoxious loner at the party trying embarrassingly to fit in with the popular crowd - one has to give it credit for trying, but still cannot like it, no matter how sorry for it one feels. -3/10",Crank
73,xredgarnetx,Awful junk,3,22 January 2007,"There's no way to mistake CRANK for one of THE TRANSPORTER movies, as slim as those movies are. With a plot line that steals liberally from THE BOURNE IDENTITY, Jason Statham plays a killer who has gone soft and the mob decides must be eliminated. He is injected with a slow-acting poison and must keep on the move if he hopes to track down his killer(s). You've seen a similar plot in DOA, first with Edmund O'Brien and in the remake with Dennis Quaid. You've also seen the need-for-speed elements played out in SPEED. So what's left? Some frenetic fighting and chase scenes, and a bit of dark humor, none of which are as satisfying as those in THE TRANSPORTER flicks. The climax will have your jaw hitting the ground, but not in a good way. You may safely skip CRANK.",Crank
74,Prashast_Singh,A terrific action movie!,10,3 February 2019,"I was really amazed by the time the film ended. CRANK is a very fresh, original, intelligent action movie that doesn't shy away from occasional explicity and even some awkwardness, the two things that make the proceedings so much fun. The action is mind-blowing and non-stop, with a blackly funny layer added to all the set pieces. But it's the plot which stands tall as per the action filmmaking standards.CRANK is edited extremely well. Right from the beginning to the very end, you don't feel it could've been shorter as the editing is neatly done. Plus, it's not a very long film and the directors deserve all the applause for keeping the film straightforward without any unnecessary subplots. Jason Statham is highly impressive in the film and his performance is spot-on. I will watch more of his action movies from now on.Story is unique in its own and gets the adrenaline pumping. Execution too is near-flawless. It can at times make you a bit uncomfortable, but the effective handling of those sequences ensures you embrace it in a positive way. CRANK is an extremely realistic, blackly funny and suspenseful action entertainer that gets the most points for its original, crisp, unique plot filled with outstanding action sequences. Strictly not for kids, though.",Crank
75,IonicBreezeMachine,"What Eli Roth is to horror, Neveldine/Taylor are to action",6,23 July 2021,"When Chev Chelios (Jason Statham ) is given a slow acting poison by opportunistic thug Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) Chev learns that he will die in roughly one hour's time and can only slow down the poison by continuously moving and keeping his adrenaline up. Now racing against time, Chev cuts a swath of destruction across Las Angeles for a last shot at revenge.An unapologetic mix of After Hours, Run Lola Run, Trainspotting and GTA, Crank makes no secret about what kind of movie it is right out of the gate with a twisted, juvenile, aggressive take on the standard hitman formula with a hard knuckle almost guerilla style approach. A movie like Crank is essentially critic proof as the same points people praise Crank for will also be used as points of criticism against it. With that said, the movie is certainly a white knuckle ride that isn't afraid to go to sleazy and destructive places and whether you love or hate the movie that's a point you have to respect.Jason Statham is absolutely amazing in the role of Chev Chelios who loses himself in the frantic and desperate performance with a nice undercurrent of crazed manic energy that gives the whole affair a darkly comic edge that keeps you engaged throughout. Statham goes through so much punishment in this movie with highlights including riding a motorcycle bare-ass naked in a hospital gown, having sex in a public place in Chinatown, or the high point (no pun intended) a mano a mano with the big bad in a helicopter several stories above the ground not using a stunt double. The action in the movie is impactful and well staged, but the camera work honestly makes it somewhat challenging to see it. While the camera work does work in making us feel like we're seeing the events the same way Chev is seeing them, some of the camera work can become downright nauseating from how ADD and cut happy the filmmaking is.Crank whether you love it or hate it is unmistakably Neveldine/Taylor. Much like Eli Roth's Horror film's Neveldine/Taylor's action films can be identified fairly easily even if you mis the credits. With its fast pace and strange sense of humor it's a movie that is upfront about what it is and who it's for. If that sounds like your type of experience, you've found it.",Crank

So, heads up to the guys who are looking to see a martial arts flick.I'd have to say this is Jason's best work. Which is a pretty bold thing to say. He's been in a few crowd pleasers: Snatch and The Transporters. He doesn't show his athletic prowess like he does in his other work but he does show that he has tons of charisma. Having worked on Guy Ritchie films the dude has learned how to act. Adding that to his athletic ability, you have a bona fide movie star. Because of this movie I now look at him in a different light.The movie itself is about a guy named Chev who is poisoned and must keep his adrenaline/heart rate up to survive. The movie isn't just that simple, it has a couple side stories, but you don't really care about anything else, just his safety and the stunts he'll perform.The movie is one of the best action comedies I've ever seen. Personally I enjoyed the first half more than the second half, but overall the movie was a joy to watch, well worth the matinée price.The movie had everything a great action/comedy needs. Good acting from the leads, nice direction, great action, fun laughs, some sex, nudity and one big boner.",Crank

79,jaredmobarak,Who wants white meat?Crank,6,7 January 2007,"Any movie these days starring Jason Statham is going to be an adrenaline rush of action, speed, and wit. With Crank, we literally get all of the qualities packed together in an 87- minute orgy of fast-paced violence and sex. Statham's character has done his last hit as an assassin and those who held that job in ill will have decided to take him out. Knowing that killing this sadomasochist while he felt the pain would probably be the kind of death he wants, they resort to injecting him with a poison concoction that slowly destroys his body by inhibiting his production of adrenaline. He now has a few hours to get back at the men who've plotted against him, say goodbye to his girlfriend, and die with dignity. The only way he will even come close to having the time to do it all is if he continues at break-neck speed with any stimulants available to course through his body and give him precious seconds of life.Credit all involved here for knowing exactly what this film was going to be and sticking to their guns. Crank is shot with fast cuts, loud heart-pumping music, and gimmicks galore allowing the audience to join in on the fun and speed of Chev Chelios' (what a great name) last day on earth. What would usually make my eyes rollsuperimposed telephone conversations in windows and walls to avoid the use of split screen, filtered/polarized effects, diagramed layers of things to get, and text running across to emphasize words said they all work perfectly here and add to the sense of a ""Grand Theft Auto"" type game that was started at the very beginning with the title shown in 8-bit game graphics. Everything that happens is unbelievable and on the cusp of being totally, comically outrageous, yet it all just adds to the ride. This film just beefs up Statham's growing resume of action thrillers and is right up there with both films from the Transporter series.Even the cast of supporting players adds to the fun. Efren Ramirez is hilarious in a small role, a great counter to his part in the very disappointing Napoleon Dynamite. Dwight Yoakam is great as the kook doctor trying to help Statham stay alive and Amy Smart equally effective as the girlfriend Chelios was going to leave the business for. Her obliviousness to the outside world was funny and her reactions to Statham's antics priceless, (the sex scene in Chinatown makes the movie). Also, Jose Pablo Cantillo steals many scenes with his over-the-top villain Verona. He plays it up so well that you have to love the slimy jerk. Everyone seems aware of what kind of movie they are in and by acting accordingly they enhance the enjoyment. As far as these types of films go this is effective throughout on all counts. Even the ending fits like a glove, (despite what Statham's character is doing during the scene, which is quite laughable); because if it ended any other way the movie would have lost everything it was building up to.",Crank
80,vip_ebriega,Brainless headache-inducing stupidity.,2,14 May 2008,"My Take: Moronic and noisy. It's the worst kind of action thriller if I ever saw one. I have no problem enjoying some brainless summer fair, but CRANK is going way over the top, but it's also very violent and unpleasant, I didn't really take it for a second. CRANK is an overly noisy, unpleasant vomitorium loaded with unbelievable stunts, noisy action and a bad mouth. The movie's hasn't got a moment where that it pleasant, it's just restless and way too kinetic for its cause, I almost had a headache. Although I can't stop any action fan to see it, let me just tell you that it ain't for all taste, and for me, CRANK is way to far from mine.Perhaps one of the things I didn't like about CRANK is the lack of a really appealing hero. Instead of a James Bond or a John McLane, CRANK has Chev Chelios, played by Jason Statham (THE TRANSPORTER), who is not even close to one of the more likable action heroes. The character wasn't practically interesting to start with, but he makes himself worse when he isn't, for once, likable or appealing. He's to reckless and vigilante to be as appealing as many other action heroes. It may take Statham a few more rounds as an action hero to have me at hello. To be fair, the plot is quite ingenious as it is introduced. The lead character is injected with a poisonous serum that slowly kills him if his heart rate drops. To keep himself alive, he has to keep his adrenaline up a notch. Good idea! But then, it quickly devolves into unbelievable action scenes that lack the sort of glee when an action hero, specifically the likes of James Bond, do unbelievable (yet somewhat convincing) stunts. Then it gets worse when it gives room for Statham to talk foul-mouth with people he manages to pass by (these include a doctor and his patient in one of the film's most unpleasant scenes, an there are lot). CRANK is the likes of movies I like most of the time, but I didn't really like this one. The film doesn't give me a reason to like it. I usually like unbelievable action scenes in an action movie with a break-neck fast pace. CRANK is that film (it has stunts and a fast pace), but it lacks the joy and glee. I wasn't at all in a straight face when I see Statham drive his car on an escalator or the unbelievable ending that has to be seen to believe. I usually applause with delight when I see these things, but here, I hardly cared. It's like listening to a bunch amateur rock band who only knows how to strum the electric guitar like a maniac, but they don't know how to write a song. The end credits signaled the feeling of relief I wanted after almost an hour (but it lasted almost a lifetime). Rating: * out of 5.",Crank
81,fmarkland32,Injected with a poison!,8,17 August 2009,"Chev Chelios (Jason Statham, a great action star) is an assassin who has been injected with a poison, a poison that will kill him unless he keeps himself charged with adrenaline, for Chelios wants to survive not necessarily to live a happy life but rather so he can kill those responsible for his plight in what is easily a classic that might have started the comeback in action films. Crank is not only a good movie, it's as far as i'm concerned a classic of the genre. Let me put it to you this way, this would've fit in perfectly with a Van Damme head basher of the early 90s, actually it would even hold it's own against a Schwarzenegger flick. This is high praise as I enjoy both action stars. Crank works due to it's lack of self awareness, over the top carnage and a hero who feels true to the classic action hero of the good old days. Indeed this is the perfect example of what is great about a genre, the movie is fast paced, well acted and the direction is precise. The camera manages to capture the action sequences and the soundtrack which in my mind still features the best use of a Loverboy song (Turn Me Loose, for all you youngsters) and Amy Smart is without a doubt one of the hottest heroines in an action film in ages. Smart plays it tongue in cheek, and her sequence where Statham has sex with her in public to keep his energy up, could in fact strike one offensive, until you see the way Smart plays it for laughs and it's obvious her playful performance makes it hard to take the movie's risqué parts seriously, indeed she manages to be still sexy and humorous here. Indeed Statham and Smart share great chemistry and their chemistry adds unexpected depth to what would be preposterous. The action element is fantastic, the pace is fast and the film while ridiculous makes for fantastic guilty pleasure fun.* * *1/2 out of 4-(Very Good)",Crank

83,jon.h.ochiai,Pass on Crank,5,9 September 2006,"Jason Statham is the most exciting new action star to come along in years. Statham is rugged, charismatic, and a great martial artist. Directors and Writers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's ""Crank"" starts with an intriguing storyline: Hit man Chev Chelios (Statham) wakes and discovers that he has been poisoned by mob boss Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo); Chev will die if his heart rate falls below a certain level. ""Crank"" is a lot like the movie ""Speed"" without the bus. Therefore, Chev (Statham) must exact his revenge on those who poisoned him before he dies. However, all is lost in the execution. Most of ""Crank"" is crap. The action is stupid action. More specifically, it is not the cool choreographed action of the ""Transporter"" movies. ""Crank"" suffers from misrepresentation. The story itself devolves into ordinary lacking any clever style. Along the way we learn a lot from Chev's phone conversations with his personal physician Doc Miles (laid back Dwight Yoakam) about the human adrenal system. It's like the Discovery Channel. This literally becomes at times a PowerPoint presentation on screen. Doc informs Chev that he must keep his adrenal system engaged by chemical stimulant or sex, which leads to a funny public display with his girlfriend Eve (plucky Amy Smart). Chev must also ingest large doses of epinephrine (adrenaline). Ultimately, ""Crank"" wastes the talent of Statham.Apparently, this all started when Chev was hired to kill Triad kingpin Don Kim (Keone Young). Verona (over the top and annoying Cantillo) injects Chev with some sort of ""Thai cocktail"" that will eventually kill him. So Chev must kill those who poisoned him, find an antidote, and protect his girlfriend Eve. There are a couple double crosses along the way. The premise runs weary and dry half way through ""Crank"". Jason Statham is good in spite of ""Crank"". However, his screen presence and physicality alone can not overcome the lameness of Neveldine and Taylor's screenplay. And for me the story resolution is so unsatisfying. Amy Smart adds a ditsy charm as Eve, who really does not have clue until it is much too late. There are some funny gags in ""Crank"", and some of the action sequences are exciting. Take a pass on ""Crank"". Wait for a better Jason Statham movie. This is just a thought.",Crank
84,cchase,"""Crack"" Noir...",7,21 July 2007,"Like the audience it's meant for, I would bet my next week's paycheck that directors Neveldine and Taylor, who also wrote the script for CRANK, probably don't even realize that this plot has been around since before they were born; appearing first as the 1950 noir thriller D.O.A. with Edmond O'Brien, which itself was remade in 1988 as a vehicle for a young(er) Dennis Quaid and the future Mrs. Quaid, Meg Ryan. In the original D.O.A., a private dick wakes up to find out that he's been fatally poisoned and only has twenty-four hours to finger his own murderer, before the Grim Reaper punches his ticket.All CRANK does is add a few more details. Now the anti-hero is would-be-retired pro hit-man Chev Chelios (Statham), who angered the employers who contracted him for a hit he decided not to expedite. Said employers have therefore made their displeasure known, by having Chelios injected with a drug that will slow down and eventually stop his heart. The only thing that can keep him alive until he finds his killers is adrenaline - of any and every kind...Think of this as yet another version of SPEED, only now the object of maximum velocity is not on four wheels, but two legs. At times, the scenario careens from the outrageous to the downright ridiculous, but it's a major credit to Statham's screen presence that we're even rooting for Chelios at all, considering how much collateral damage he racks up as he turns downtown L.A. into his own personal XBOX shoot-'em-up, in his quest to take down his enemies before the drug in his system takes HIM down.It's just too bad that the scant attention paid to his back story isn't extended all that much to his co-stars, who do what they can to make an impression. Efren Ramirez is woefully underused as a drag queen who also serves as Chelios' eyes and ears on the street (and what I would've given to know more about the story there), and Amy Smart does her best as a goofy, early Goldie-Hawn type with less smarts and looser panties. Dwight Yoakam and Reno Wilson have great cameos as Chev's personal ""physician"" and a Jamaican cabbie, respectively. But exactly like a video game, the characters are more stereotypes than characters we get to learn something about, which I guess there's no point in griping about. CRANK is all about the stunts and the shootings, and there's plenty of both on hand.I realize that the herky-jerky camera-work is supposed to be innovative, as it puts us in harm's way right with Chelios as he shoots, punches, slices and dices and crashes through virtually everyone and everything he comes into contact with. But CRANK is like film noir on crack, and unfortunately because of this quality, there's no time to establish a mood or a rhythm that is so native to the genre, and sets apart the best classic examples (like DOUBLE INDEMNITY or BODY HEAT) from the flashes-in-the-pan.Though more than a little different, boiled down to its essence, CRANK is nothing more than another popcorn-driven vehicle for Statham, to be consumed and forgotten just as quickly as your last overpriced Diet Coke from the concession stand. And like that drink, it leaves a slightly unpleasant aftertaste...the ghost of how great this movie could have been.",Crank

One could see also the inspiration in one of the ""DOA"" thriller movies ( 50's and 80's version) or ""Speed"". It doesn't matter . What matters is that ""Crank"" is one of more original movies in last years. It was nice to see some creativity in the action genre. The idea is quite unique and I liked the movie for the fact that it was something different.""Crank"" it's like a roller-coaster. It's big budget , fast paced MTV style action video with surprises at each corner. It's not politically correct and with questionable taste in some places. It's much closer to a Grindhouse movie than the Grindhouse movies from Tarantino and Rodriguez. The humor is very black and definitely not for everyone. It might be a cult movie in the future.This movie obviously shouldn't be taken seriously. It's silly , stupid and trashy and proud of it. It is rather thin on plot and the dialogues aren't anything special , but the movie distracts you enough that you may even not notice this. The non stop action makes ""Crank"" basically an adaptation of video game like ""Grand Theft Auto"". The movie even obviously makes many references to 80's arcade games. ""Crank"" is basically an arcade game. Don't listen to people who are searching for existential dilemmas in this movie Jason Statham is good as Chev Chelios. It's hard to imagine any other action actor to be convincing in this weird role. His tough and crazy enough. The best performance however belongs to Amy Smart who plays Chelios girlfriend Eve. She's adorable as the sexy dumb blonde. The love story between them is terribly flat and unconvincing , but who cares about that in a movie like this one ? The acting of others in ""Crank"" isn't really good , especially Jose Pablo Cantillo who plays Ricky Verona . He is overacting so much that every scene he appears in is quite painful to watch. Once again with scenes like Chinatown adventure(watch the movie , you will know what I'm talking about) happening at every corner it's easy to don't care about that as well.Rookie directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor direct ""Crank"" with obvious post modern style. They borrow from Tarantino, Rodriguez, Ritchie in terms of style. ""Crank"" feels like an MTV music video that somehow is also action movie . They also use wild, colorful graphics and camera angles to make ""Crank"" look like a comic book. I don't think they come close to those directors , but I see some potential in them that sadly hasn't been proved yet. ""Crank 2"", ""Gamer"" and ""Ghost rider 2"" have all been terrible movies. One-hit wonders ? Time will tell.""Crank"" is one of those ""you'll love it or hate it"" movies. I liked it. I liked it more like a comedy than action movie. The whole movie is simply too over the top for me to make it a truly exciting experience. You don't really care about the characters and there's no suspense whatever Chelios is gonna die or not. It's too flashy , too clinical for that. It's also too trashy to be really great IMHO. It relies more on shock value than suspense. However , it's entertaining and original movie that provides good entertainment for action movie fans. It's also good to see a R-rated action movie (not too many of them are made nowadays).

But in this one, from the beginning I felt something different from the common action flick.From the beginning it showed to be a low cost film that wanted to take everything for fun, and I guess it was this special kind of humor that gave it a different touch from other action films. I mean some characters instead of being tough or rude, as it would be expectable to a gangsters' movie, are funny and almost pathetic.Besides there were a few funny scenes that made me laugh as I was watching a comedy! This film was made fun as much as for action, that absolutely clear for me! And that's why I enjoyed it! I score it 7/10.",Crank
90,oneloveall,Forward rush of a movie deemed silly in the end,5,3 September 2006,"Tony Scott-esquire induced frenzy of an action pic centers around Statham's (getting tired) character being injected with a poison of which he has only a little over an hour to live. The trick here is that this particular poison can be postponed by adrenaline, which prompts our lead to tear through almost every scene at lightening speed with no regard for his surroundings. While the ""Speed, in the body"" concept does start off with an entertaining, forward thrust of a bang, this gimmick quickly fizzles into laughable exploitation and even worse. The filmmakers go to great lengths to articulate the visual presence of the rush, and credit must be given for the tons of creative touches they wished to impart, although this is nothing that the frantic school of editing ala Tony Scott has not brought us, as a matter of fact there are several devices used throughout that seem like blatant rip offs from Scott's past few movies. Nonetheless, this is an excellent brain dead, testosterone fueled rampage of an action flick that will surely appease young guys who are thirsting for a quick boost of film speed. For all others, go in expecting an over the top, even silly action film, and you might be entertained fairly well",Crank

Of course, this movie is a lot more over the top than the Sandra Bullock vehicle. Not for a minute does it take itself seriously. It's as if the makers were trying to top each other by coming up with more ridiculous ideas for things that will give you an adrenaline rush. Jason Statham finally stars in an action movie that's obviously ironic, not like the rather embarrassing ""Transporter"" flicks. Having said that, ""Crank"" does have its flaws. It's just too damn hectic and the camera work and the editing are a joke sometimes. The movie looks cheap and the plot is so absurd it's not actually thrilling. All the charm comes from the sheer coolness of the main character and the one liners. That's what makes ""Crank"" the movie ""Snakes On A Plane"" was supposed to be. So bad, it's good? Absolutely.",Crank

The action is forgettable the dialog is regrettable. I have seen this movie with directors' commentary, two directors, both of them liked this movie and were satisfied with the final product. I saw Crank and satisfaction was not part of my experience. I don't like energy drinks I think they taste like poison feces- this movie is like watching an energy drink instead of drinking it.

So angered from this he, a top notch hit-man, starts to locate the man who did this to him. And to add his worries, he must keep his adrenaline running high all the time, so that the poison inserted in him doesn't get the best of him.If there's a word that could describe this kind of an action film, it would be video game. The movie is almost non stop action from start to finish and more than once those scenes are over the top and so entertaining, that I for once couldn't help but to enjoy of the movie. It doesn't try to be anything else than it is, and that is some what of a rare thing.The length of the movie is just about right for a story like this. At least I begun to feel a bit weary towards the end, as non stop action can be a bit over whelming, but the end credits kick in just the right place, so the movie leaves a good taste in your mouth.If you are into brainless action, then I can whole heartedly recommend Crank for you, if you need more brains, than brawn, then don't bother.",Crank

Some acknowledge that and say it pays tribute to classic video games which is only obvious because the whole movie feels like live action ""Grand Theft Auto."" The effect is just an ugly film to look at. It actually employs Google Maps as transitions between scenes, how laughable. The cinematography isn't even worth mentioning, and the characters are as flat as they come. This film was made for the sole purpose of being an ""adrenaline rush"" type of film, which probably makes it work for most but for me the problem is nothing here is memorable.The story moves briskly enough, and keeps throwing ultra-violence, sex, drugs, basically anything and everything to hold your attention. Amy Smart was one of the top billed actresses in this flick...why? Her character was basically nothing but eye candy for the easily amused. The action is over-the-top more than half the time. Makes the ""Under Siege"" films actually look plausible. Jason Statham does as good as he can, but no one in this movie is worth mention besides Mr. Statham and his girlfriend. If this is all it takes to satisfy audiences these days, then I fear what the future has to offer.",Crank
95,innocuous,"Not another ""DOA"".",7,3 February 2007,"Mindless fun, but undoubtedly over the top. This is a much better film than ""Transporter 2"", probably because it drops all pretensions. Statham plays a not-very-sympathetic character who begins to grow on you as the movie progresses. By the end, you are really concerned about how things are going to turn out and you have some empathy for a truly bad person who has to deal with his own softer side.The final scene is unoriginal, but well-done. It was a good note on which to end the story.Finally, I have no idea what the body count is, but everybody who ""got it"" deserved it.

I had liked the story and so I went to see it.The story is about a hit man Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) who is poisoned by rival gang and has 1 hour to live. In that one hour he has to kill his enemies. The only way he can survive for 1 hour is to keep his heart beat faster. Surely Chev survives one hour and more and as expected kills his enemies.But I did not survive the 90 minute trauma. The movie is a C grade movie inspired from Quentin Tarantino's style. It has all the ingredient to shock today's youth  with clumsy and awful sexual and violent scenes; certainly I smirked. I know today's youth would love this. I think It is not their poor faulttoo! The movie had scope to be a well told action story, but jack of all trades young American director Mark Neveldine dishes out his choice of menu  today's world likes and probably he relishes it too.Not much to add!

I think it could have used a bit more action and a little less swearing.When Chev is in his girl's apartment, it tends to slow down a bit, and that makes for a change for pace for the movie, but generally it is entertaining.Not greatly in-depth or even controversial, but just entertaining.Since I no longer own any video games, and this is a lot like a video game - this had to do.If you are looking for plot...go rent a drama.If you are looking to kill an hour or two, then this will do it...but don't expect more than guns, stuff blowing up, fights, some funny sex scenes and poor vocabulary.However, I think the lead was cast perfectly.",Crank

No ""The Mummy"" or ""The Fast and the Furious"" for me. Crank nails it in every way.It's hard enough to pull together a film with a lot of stunts. Then top that by making it non-stop action throughout. Then top that by having an intelligent plot that keeps you thinking and characters whose motivations and decisions make sense. Then top that by adding in some humor that doesn't blow the seriousness of the movie but adds some charm and -- listen up, Jet Li -- originality to the stunts.But then, pump it up with cinematography that (unlike The Bourne Identity, which didn't work for me) makes the whole thing even more original and adds to the drama instead of being puffery. Then add Amy Smart, yum. Despite the fast pace, there is actually real chemistry with her as the love interest.Every action movie lover should go out and see this film immediately. It is everything that Snakes on a Plane, which is cheesy and bad, and I don't mean good-bad, is not.Who should see this movie:-- Action movie fans, you might not want to bring your SO, it's pretty hardcore with the gore and violence-- Enraged assassins with 2 hours to live I'll give ""Crank"" a 9 out of 10, the only missing point being that there's no real depth to the drama, it's strictly ""just for the action"".",Crank

However the writers forgotten to write anything vaguely witty. There is a lot of bad language (yawn) and ridiculous action sequences but we have seen that all before. I quite like action films, for instance, I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed Jason Statham in the Transporter movie. This is another story altogether though, it just becomes tiresome very quickly. I know I saw the original movie that the story was taken from and remember how much I enjoyed it - I think it starred Edmond O'Brien then and even that was remade with Dennis Quaid I think. Both decent thrillers. This one is just a pain to watch, which is why I am critiquing it now after only about 30 minutes.

Having just chucked this on when it come on TV, I thought it would be some typical Statham action movie and it just wasn't that.My only issues is that I wasn't too keen about how it immediately jumped into things, no background to the character whatsoever.

104,Flagrant-Baronessa,What could be more fun that this?,7,11 November 2006,"OK  so probably quite a few movies, but you get the general idea here.Getting high on red bull, coke, nasal spray, electrical shocks, car chases, gunfights, taunting the police, having sex in public, falling through the air  there are thousands of ways to boost your adrenaline and today hard-boiled hit-man Chev (Jason Statham) will need to employ every single one. His rival and archenemy has injected him with the gruesome 'Beijing Cocktail' which means that if he slows down, he will die. ""The best thing for you is to find some nice, dark quiet place and just die."" his boss advices, but Chev has other ideas. Now he must track down his killer and get his vengeance before the poison in his veins will finish him off. 'Crank' is the type of aggressive mess that trumps all previous Statham action vehicles and that floored my so-so expectations when I set out to watch it. If you're into Tony Scott seizure-inducing kinetic cinematography and choppy editing then this film is a goldmine. Candid cameras seem to be hidden at every location, capturing the energetic unfolding of events from every angle imaginable as our hardcore protagonist navigates through the fast-paced circumstances. In the background a truly power-thumping soundtrack is booming with great aggression. It's almost a bit _too_ messy and uncoordinated at times. It becomes an adrenaline-pumping video game pastiche. Luckily, Jason Statham aptly and effortlessly sews the narrative together  he remains the film's assured centre.Although I think Statham indeed does a fine job in Crank, his character Chev  a professional assassin  should not be a particularly demanding role to inhabit. In fact I could probably see a wide variety of other actors also giving good performances. All that is required from Statham is running, sweating, swearing and generally looking menacing and aggressive, all the while delivering dialogue that is as camp as a row of tents. What is not to love? Regrettably the same dynamics cannot not be attributed to Crank's supporting characters. Few are even worth mentioning and far worse is that its main villain is actually not a threatening figure, but a lowly little rat. Amy Smart also gets to inhabit a truly badly-written cheesy role as the girly damsel in distress  easily one of the least PC character inclusions I have seen in recent years.Yet I feel it would be unfair to seriously evaluate a filmno, movielike this on the dimensions of its characters. The fact is that Crank is a success, and even a towering action achievement. It offers little besides its no-nonsense approach to violence, but we demand little else since it is so well-condensed (a mere 87 minutes of non-stop action) and entertaining.7.5 out of 10",Crank

'Crank' is another great film from Mr. Statham.It has plenty of blood, action, story, interesting characters, and even some humor.In fact, this movie has lots of comedy.His sequel was far superior than the first and took everything that I said 'Crank' had and multiplies it by 100.Definetly worth a look if you're an action movie fan.I haven't seen all of his movies,but the ones that I have seen were awesome.Can anyone tell me if there's going to be a Crank 3?

No one could have played this better than the consistently good Jason Statham. He knows what he is good at, and he thrives in pretty much always delivering the goods. Now this film is unapologetic and it has a great ending. The basic setup is that we pretty much know and in real time how much time he has to live. This film must have been a blast to have been a part of, and all the stunts are top notch, and I love the fact the script is so tight and doesn't really waste any time with pointless dialog. I am pleased to see that slowly but surely Statham is growing his fan base and people are appreciating his talent. Now will he ever win an Oscar, probably not, are his films almost constantly fun and entertaining, absolutely! For anyone that wants to see a hardcore action flick that is pretty much the most action packed film with insane stunts and setups, watch it and enjoy it. This isn't a spoiler but one of the best scenes was with Amy Smart in the middle of a crowd with him doing something with her to keep his adrenaline up.

Shouldn't be so hard when you're an ex-assassin with half the LA underworld at your heels, but Chelios makes a real mission of it. The excitement sure rubs off on the audience: ""Crank"" is visually intense, an all-around big dipper at supersonic pace. Chev's initially clueless girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) is the saucy icing on this racy cake of an action flick. I have *loved* Amy Smart ever since she took it out on Charlene in ""Rat Race"", possibly the most gripping portrayal of a jealous girlfriend in motion picture history. But the public coitus interruptus, interrupted by, of all things, a wayward cell phone call, is out of this world. Go see ""Crank"" for the Chinatown sex scene alone.

Well writer, director team Neveldine/Taylor have used the basic premised, tweaked a few things and BAM, out pops Crank. Hit man Chev Chelios has been poisoned by rival Verona. Once mixed with the blood, the poison slows the body down till you die, only way to slow the poison is adrenalin; lots of adrenalin.From get go, Crank explodes, hits the ground running without a stop for breath. Much to Chelios's predicament, everything must keep going at ridiculously top speed. But for all the adrenalin Crank oozes out, you're not getting the hit bringing you to the edge of your seat; your slumming it waiting for the end to hurry up and arrive.Crank is a film that has indulgent romp stamped all over it. Over the top plot and concept, bloody violence, the high octane action injection you want to satisfy your hedonistic pleasure of pointless violence. Though Neveldine/Taylor just do everything wrong from the opening scene. Plot is very quickly set, Chelios starts running, Refused's New Noise blasting, and it quickly hits flat line.The problem revolves around the directing and editing. The directing is hyper active and detracting. Yes it runs parallel to the bombastic speed the film runs at, but action scenes are poorly captured with a camera that can't sit still. Badly used swipe screens, split screens, acid washes do nothing but distract. It's a very amateurish affair. It's not about just clicking off and enjoying the ride, you have to go brain dead. Suspension of disbelieve is to hard in Crank. An emaciated script, cringing humour, and constant plot holes and anomalies abundant.Jason Statham could be a great action actor. Yet he's far from it, relying heavily on his gruffing voice. Once he's starts injecting some charisma and show man ship, he might be the next big action star. Amy Smart is irritatingly flaky and moronic. Dwight Yoakam the only one not taking his role over the top, though far from his best.Crank has all the right ingredients and elements for a great action flick, but implodes right from the start.",Crank

Stay far away.There is seriously nothing good about this movie other than the production value, which means absolutely nothing to me. I've seen great movies with horrible production quality but they had everything else. This has nothing else, at all. The story sucks, the only thing it has going for it is Beijing Cocktail but even that is over the top. As I said earlier, it is just like long commercial. There is so much product placement and it's so blatant and in your face that it made me want to vomit. The story is so miserable that the producers attempted to cover it up with flashy special effects and ""fun"" action sequences. What have I left out? Oh yeah, the ""acting."" The acting was pretty bad. Not horrible, just like Hallmark channel miniseries bad. I can't believe I made it all the way through this poor excuse for a film.This movie sucks.

113,Quicksand,The Greatest Film Ever Made by a Human Being,10,4 September 2006,"There's over-the-top, and then there's beyond. For me, ""Crank"" achieved legendary status about 30 minutes in, when a stray bullet takes out an old lady's parakeet. And then it continues getting better, or continues getting more ridiculous, depending on what demographic you're in, or how serious you actually take your movies.Far, away, and above anything starring Vin Diesel or Samuel L. Jackson (sorry, guys), ""Crank"" oozes adrenaline, and is saturated with testosterone. I was born in the 1970's, but I still can't conceive of how any male couldn't get into the sheer, primal charge of a movie where the main character has to inject drugs, shock himself, and be pleasured by his smoking-hot girlfriend, all before his inevitable death. And that's just the screenplay.The direction is surprisingly sharp, as are the moments of humor (both visually and aurally). Shades of ""Natural Born Killers"" lurk around the edges, as images of characters not even in the scene are projected on walls, and subtitles leap off the screen or shield characters eyes. It's like a roller coaster that never lets up-- you either shut your eyes and wait for it to be over, or you experience it full force, and leave charged up and ready for action.Perhaps a roller coaster isn't accurate-- that has dips and valleys, and ""Crank"" achieves a feat other movies have tried at and failed: the constant adrenaline rush. On some Hong Kong movies, or an American one like ""Blackhawk Down,"" eventually the constant stimulation just becomes too much. But the visceral attack of ""Crank"" is so varied, so off the wall, and so utterly ridiculous, that it never gets old and never flags. And the soundtrack rocks from Frame One to Frame Last, with some nice denouement over the closing credits to take the edge off. It's a skydive, and the credits are the parachute.Where studio execs had to backpedal to make ""Snakes on a Plane"" R-rated and anything even worth paying for, they hit the ball out of the park with ""Crank."" It's glorious, excessive and aggressive, and perhaps the final time we'll ever see Jason Statham again.Inarguably, with this film, Statham has now peaked. ""Transporter"" was good, ""Transporter 2"" was better, and this is the end-all, be-all. On the horizon he has a Uwe Boll ""film,"" the next Guy Ritchie bomb, and the directorial debut of Philip G. Atwell, whose sum-total of directing experience involves pointing the camera at rappers.Maybe Statham will return and maybe he won't. But we're left with this exercise in excess, and I have absolutely zero complaints. 10/10.",Crank
114,CelluloidRehab,"The Transporter on the Beijing Cocktail, with an ephedrine and cocaine chaser",9,25 January 2007,"Having first become acquainted with Jason Statham from Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, I can safely say he has become the epitome of the tough guy. Most of the movies he has made since (with the exception of Snatch) are your run-of-the-mill action movie. I did like Transporter, with the exception of the second half of the movie which completely ran out of gas. There was definite potential there. The Transporter 2 completely obliterated any chance, by completely going off the deep end and not in a good way either.Thankfully someone learned from all these movies and came up with Crank. Crank has a very simplistic plot. Chev Chelios (Statham) is well-known contract assassin, who wakes up to discover he has been poisoned with a concoction called the Beijing cocktail. It will stop his heart unless he keeps it going, by ANY MEANS NECESSARY!!!! The rest of the movie is figuring out what he's gonna do next and how he's going to tell his clueless, but very attractive girl friend (Amy Smart). This is the fun part of the entire movie. It is basically a live-action mash-up of Narc (the video game from the 80's), GTA (any of them) and some heart-bounding music videos. The formula is simple enough, but can be difficult in the execution (see some of Jason's other movies for reference). The rookie directorial duo of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor do an exceptional job a portraying stylized, non-stop action.This is an archetypal action movie, not that the movie does anything overly original. What it does it does well and keeps it going pretty much throughout the entire movie. There are few breaks. I had a hard time not breaking a sweat or commenting out loud. I had been disappointed by more recent action movies. This one actually delivers. It delivers everything : car chases, helicopters, mêlée, gun play, explosions, sex, lots and lots of drugs, blood, profanity galore, more stimulants, a mall, a hospital, a drug lord, the amusing Dwight Yoakam and even Pedro (running for class president from Napolean Dynamite). The video game theme permeates every pore of this movie (from the opening heartbeat to the post credit side-scroller). For anyone who has had the sandbox experience of GTA will certainly recognize and appreciate this movie. I highly recommend this for fans of action. I'm feeling a little woozy.

Basically its a film about a man that has to stay 'stimulated' for a lengthy period of time, because he was ingested with a certain drug. This film is just horrible and Jason Stratham has to be one of the worst actors of all time. Mr. Stratham is not protagonist that is even barely likable. You wish for him to get an early demise, to end this silly borefest. He makes Steven Segall look like Marlon Brando. In one scene , Mr. Stratham rapes a woman in the middle of Chinatown, in broad daylight , of course, she eventually likes it. This scene besides being totally unrealistic. One would think NYC Cops would stop , this perverse behaviour, is just one of the worst , if not the worst scene of all time. When I see such high ratings, I know its not me. I would imagine with how stupid this film is, that perhaps it has a cult following. In fact , the film ,unfortunately , in my opinion, had a sequel. I missed the boat on this one. If a third Crank comes out... I am going to go to the movie line and try to sell bridges to the folks on line.",Crank
117,refresh_daemon,"If you really need an action film, this might do it.",6,26 September 2006,"So I watched this movie while on temporary leave in Oregon. It wasn't a crapfest like I was expecting. It's not all bad either.So the film revolves around this guy who gets poisoned and needs adrenaline to keep himself going. He goes on a mad rampage after the guy that poisoned him (and to keep himself going). That's basically the film.Watching the film reminded me of watching a very long extended music video, with all the visual tricks and the pacing of a music video. Except it goes on for a feature length film's running time. And there's the problem. This film does have its moments (including a scene involving epinephrine, a needle, and a humorous follow); but it's too long to support that. In the end, you feel more exhausted than exhilarated because it fills the film with ""action"" in order to keep the length appropriate for a feature and yet, it doesn't really help the film's narrative or provide anything necessary. And the story isn't enough to keep the film propelled for the length. If Crank were just 30 minutes long, it would've been much better.It's nothing amazing or even impressive, but it is an action film with some comedy thrown into the mix. It's got a lot of kinetics going on but the story is lackluster. And it's overlong by about an hour. I'd rather feel at the end of the film that I was on a good thrill ride, rather than running a marathon barefoot at sprint speeds. Thrill rides at the theme parks are all very short. Usually less than a minute. Crank should've taken a cue from that and put all its best minutes together and cut the rest. Tack it on as part of an omnibus or as a short before another shorter feature and you have a decent film.In its current state. Passable. If you really need an action film, this might do it. But you're not missing out on much if you miss it. 6/10.Also: One other glaring detraction from the film that few will notice is that the film is outstandingly ignorant of the differences between Asian groups. During the course of the film, all the Asians are referred to as part of the Chinese Triads, connected to China and otherwise referred to as Chinese (including a scene in Chinatown). However, the ""Chinese"" boss figure is named ""Don Kim"", which is most likely a Corean last name. The ""all look same"" effect continues as all Asian language speaking characters speak Corean exclusively, while continuing to be referred to as Chinese. This is in all likelihood a matter of ignorance, laziness and/or contempt on the part of the filmmakers and does not speak favorably of the film, at least in regard to contributing towards the greater society; and, in fact, detracts from better race dialogue by enforcing the ""all look same"" mentality prevalent in the majority mindset. This aspect of the film is undeniably stupid.",Crank
118,Jacques98,Finlay a filmmakers who understands their fan-base!,6,25 September 2008,"Crank has balls and does what every other pansy action movie this decade has been afraid to do: it has action.End review.Oh, wait, I need 10 lines, umm . . .Until Crank, I lost all faith in the action genre all together. When I saw ""action"" on the back of a movie, I couldn't help but think: ""a Lifetime TV drama that opens with an explosion, the secondary character is killed off, the rest is talking scenes, and then it ends with a lame two-minute action sequence where the cliché main character lives or dies."" That is all that is on the action market anymore. If you were to go up to an action director and tell him to put true action into his movie, he'd laugh in your face and tell you ""action"" in the 21st century is really a synonym for ""pointless dialogue"". Do you see why I lost faith in the genre? Then, out of nowhere, Crank shows up and leads true hardcore action fans into the promise land. It actually has action! I just can't get over that fact. I've sat through so many dramas that pretended to be action, Crank was just a kick in the face of everything every single action movie this generation has lacked. From open to close, something is happening on the screen. There is no dead-time. There is no ""So, how boring was your life, sweetie? My life as a cliché action hero has never been more boring. Wanna go stare at the wall and have a boring conversation about the 'plot' that the audience figured out from the first trailer?"" scenes. Crank has action. Crank has style. Crank is crude. What more is there to ask for? Well, honestly, the movie wasn't perfect. First off, there was hardly any violence/gore whatsoever, and that really made the movie seem a little dull. Second, they could have used the style a little more copiously, because it just seemed a little inconsistent. Third, there wasn't much truly original about it. Forth, there were no plot twists or anything to add another layer of amazingness other than the already amazing story. Fifth, though there is a lot of action, some of it gets repetitive.But I can look past all the negative things I just said when I remember that Crank had action. After being deprived of action in action movies for so long, this is like a gulp of lemonade after being dehydrated. Sure, lemonade isn't as good as wine or even pop, but it's better than dying.Eh, that was a terrible metaphor. Whatever. Just watch Crank and support real action, not the synthetic ""Oh no! My son is dying, let me kill this terrorist by talking so much his ears bleed!"" crap that this generation is obsessed with.6/10",Crank

120,tburke85,Crank A Solid Action Thriller Better Than Expected,7,2 June 2009,"Crank is a solid action thrill ride that was better than expected powered by a fantastic performance by Jason Statham whose other film credits include Snatch, The Transporter, and Death Race. Statham does a great job in the role of Chev Chelios a hit-man who's poisoned with a Chinese cocktail that cuts off the adrenaline in his body so in order to stay alive he must keep moving at any cost or he's dead. Statham brings a fierce intensity to the character and he's earned this role after everything you see him do in the movie. Major props to Statham because he really shows through his performance the adrenaline boiling up in his character ready to explode at any minute and he stays like that for the majority of the movie. Well done. Statham's co-star Amy Smart plays Eve whose his totally oblivious stoner girlfriend and she does a good job with the role. She might not get a lot screen time but she makes for a believable clueless girlfriend. She's also featured in ""spolier"" two scenes I can't even write about in this review. For those of you have seen it you know which two scenes I'm talking about. The rest of the cast including Efren Ramirez, Reno Wilson, and Dwighty Yoakam are admirable in their roles but like Smart they're not given much to do. Directors Mark Neveldine and Bryan Taylor show some real talent with this film making it an edgy action thriller that's very different from any other one you've seen before. Overall Crank was better than expected but with some flaws with the dialgoue at times, some of the shaky camera work, and the ending could've been better. Other then that though Crank is packed with plenty of action with is basically non-stop from the start, solid performances from most of the cast especially Statham, and some small does of humor that make for an entertaining action thriller to watch.",Crank

But while watching the film I couldn't help but think, this isn't what I expected... Crank surely has great potential. After hearing what's about, your bound to be ""I WANNA SEE THAT!"" With a high rating from IMDb that raises your expectations even more, but the film is just too stylized. From the beginning, you might have ""well this isn't so bad"" but as the film progresses it gets wilder and wilder, and just a little too wild. You can't help but have some adrenaline kicking in, which I liked, but again, they over did it. The film didn't need no character development or anything along those lines and it's pure fun from the first scene. But I'm going to say it one last time, if you want to have fun, don't OVER do it. The film was really funny also, and at times I was laughing myself silly. I had fun with the film, and if you like fast-paced films with no point except for pure entertainment, this film is for you!

123,Mr_Censored,The Crank Job,7,24 July 2009,"Jason Statham (""The Bank Job,"" ""The Transporter"") further solidifies his status as the new millennium's action hero in ""Crank."" In the film, directed by the team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, Statham plays a hit-man on his way out who is given an hour to live when he is injected by a deadly drug. In order to stay alive, he must keep moving, keeping the heart pumping and adrenaline flowing, which means he engages in many a crazy car chase, inhales pharmaceutical drugs, sky dives without a parachute and even finds time to make love to his dopey girlfriend (Amy Smart) in a scene that needs to be seen to be believed.Without a doubt, ""Crank"" is the definitive action movie for the X-Box and energy-drink generation. It's loud, it's fast and it's insane. Nothing is off-limits in the hour and a half the movie plays out in. Turning off many a critic, but no doubt stimulating the senses of its intended audience, ""Crank"" is a brilliantly directed, tightly paced film that exceeds any and all expectations. The action is not as crazy as you would expect, in fact, it's crazier, and just when you find yourself thinking: ""They wouldn't do that, would they?"" they in fact, do. As first time feature film directors, Neveldine and Taylor handle the action with natural ease, going for the jugular with each and every scene. The editing is fast and hyper, feeling a lot like a music video at times, but is appropriate for the material at hand. Fact is, this isn't meant to be an intelligent (although it's not dumb) or profound (but it is profoundly fun) film.The story is simple, straight and to the point. You get all major plot-points within ten minutes at the beginning of the film, and from there on out, it's non-stop action and insanity. Truth be told, ""Crank"" is just as much a video game experience as it is a movie, and you'll even find several subtle references to old-school gaming that help set the tone. While the film is admittedly over-the-top and afflicted with A.D.D., what you see is what you get, and those who want a high-voltage action film that never lets up and is never afraid to push the limits of good taste will find ""Crank"" a satisfying fix.",Crank

It's all about mindless violence, car chases, gratuitous nudity, and sex in the middle of Chinatown for everyone to see, all humorously told to keep all the action light and non-committal.Jason Statham is perfectly cast as the vengefully walking dead hit-man Chev with his Neanderthal hunched back walk and complete disregard for everyone in his path save for whatever his goal may be in the next few minutes of his fast disintegrating life. Amy Smart's performance is unexpected, obviously meant to titillate (definitely not a big career move, possibly just to pay next month's bills).Nevertheless, Crank is still holding on as a box office hit, proof that what's a killer at the tills is not necessarily what works for us all (chew on that the next time you buy a bestseller).",Crank

When it started the graphics and video-like aspects of it made me want to leave. But, once I watched a bit, I realized it is a cartoon, a sort of Road Runner in reverse, with Statham as a super-tough version of that wily bird.I can't remember titles, but the premise of the doomed poisoned man pursuing his killers has been done many times, as far back as the forties (maybe farther).Statham shines in this role, the competent and menacing killing machine with a soft side. That soft side is reserved for Eve (Amy Smart), his kooky flower child of a girlfriend. In the tradition of True Lies, Eve knows nothing of Chev's career as a top hit man, thinking him a video game salesman. While Ms. Smart is delectable in a way, her character throws a monkey-wrench in the gears of the movie's pacing for a bit. Chev has to keep his adrenaline level high to stay alive to pursue those who poisoned him, and in one scene the only way he can do it is to have public sex with Eve. This, to me, was the low point in the movie, although the theater I was in broke out in cheers!

The plot element of a fatal slow-acting poison is not new, but the use of that idea as the basis for this film was a stroke of genius.I'm not sure this was originally a graphic novel, but if it was, this film is exactly how a graphic novel should be filmed. The camera-work is frenetic, but not confusing. The subtitling was a riot--as was the ""dubbed"" dialogue.I guess the director will be compared to Tarantino, and I think the comparison should be very favorable. I note that Kill Bill required two lengthy films, and this one was accomplished in under 90 minutes.This film could not exist without Jason Statham. He plays his role absolutely straight, and not as a comic commenting on the absurdity of the situations by laughing at his own character. His usual tough-guy criminal character in this comedy is what makes the film so funny. Jason Statham plays his character exactly as you would have expected Jason Statham to play it, and his timing and his ability to avoid parody is probably one of the finest acting jobs I have seen in quite a while.

Statham is like a roller coaster, it goes up and goes down. Up with Cellular, down with the Transporter. Shame that most of this coaster is spiraling down and really down with this slab of garbage known as ""Crank"", a blatant and pathetic ripoff of Speed. How original. Allow me to elaborate: Crank starts off with our hero watching a tape of a group of bad guys near our unconscious hero. They inject him and now he is going to die if his heart rate is below a certain rate. Why the bad guys just did not finish him off there is beyond me as that would be a lot more simple than slow death, but that's what happens when I apply logic to idiocy.Anyway, Chaz has got to keep himself pumped till he gets the bad guys and will do whatever to do so. Many of these said things are lame and boring such as raiding a store for energy drinks or trying to head-bang to crappy music. Needless to say, the screenplay is terrible and this was a disaster from the start.I am unsure of why Amy Adams is here, buts she is and clearly did not enjoy herself in a drab and forgettable performance and the same goes for Statham. He can be a good actor, just most of the time it's rinse and repeat for Statham as the predicable tough guy. The action is cluttered and boring, the editing is atrocious, the bad guys are one dimensional and the ending is truly insulting to your intelligence.Crank is first grade trash.

It takes a while to get to know who the really bad guys are too as he roughs up some good guys along the way, and that makes it somewhat confusing for the audience. Yes, yes, I know, he is desperate. The concept is good, but the enactment of everything is too much in the ultra fast zone. Yes, I know he had to keep moving or die; and we had to keep moving along with him. Not good for my RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome). But it's hard to relax and watch a movie with all that commotion going on. Hey, I watch for entertainment and don't want to watch someone face a life and death decision every 20-seconds.

Even as a light-hearted romp with an adrenaline junkie, it still blew. I was so confused as to whether or not to care about anyone in that damn film for the entire film.The plot anyone can check out on IMDb, but there's no back story for the guy past his days working with a crime syndicate. Whatever girl in the movie (Amy Smart's character) fell for him as being some mean-looking video game programmer is a total bimbo and deserves this crazed maniac of a man. Jason Statham, who's previous roles in The Transporter could've easily been played in this one, is basically a guy's excuse to check out some dude who has it all (nice furniture and underground goings-on), and it forced to figure out how to live however long he can with this Oriental serum in his bloodstream. And, for action-film fans' sake, he has to keep his adrenaline up like an extra in a Mountain Dew commercial on crack throughout the whole 88 minutes of film-time.When did filmmakers decide that the machines should do all the work for them? I counted too many filters being used all the time, too many cheap transitional effects from shot to shot, too many boring shots of JS looking ""out of it,"" and heard way too many corny sound effects (a goat when JS laughs around the end?) to forgive the filmmakers for this ridiculousness. If you're going to wear the action film jacket on the DVD, don't sell me a comedy. But it was the directors' first film, which means they shouldn't be allowed to make any more after this one. Someone should take their computers right out of their studios because they rely on them to make the shot better than their eyes do. Anyone seen Biker Boys? They were visual effects guys on that bomb, too.The music was just annoying, like something off a bad modern rock station, even though it drove the film as if we are watching a long music video. The cinematography relied on Statham all the time; in fact, I got so sick of seeing him in almost every shot. Just like in Transporter when they had him sliding around in oil, now they got his ass sticking out of a hospital gown and banging a chick in public...I question the image Statham is allowing himself to become.All in all, never see the film.

Trust me, 1h30min of this roller-coaster adrenaline chase is enough and I do not mean it in a negative way - I would not like to see the flick shorter nor any longer as it is perfect as it is! Anyone who has grown a predilection for Statham's acting ought to see this one. I can imagine that fans of films such as Snatch and Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels will love this one. Noteworthy is that I perceived the pace of Crank to be somewhat higher than the pace of the other films previously mentioned. Crank brings about violence, drugs, sex and even more violence, so sensitive viewers may want to take caution. Crank is not just another film depicting fast-cut scenes of violence, however, and I believe it as a lot more to offer the cinema-goers than just stimulating their thirst for violence.

135,samseescinema,just swirling vomit in a rotting toilet bowl,2,1 September 2006,"Crank -reviewed by Sam Osborn-rating: -1.0 out of 4There was a good idea hidden somewhere within this muck: a film that starts with its foot lead-heavy on the gas pedal without any reason to brake; something that starts with fury and fireworks and never stops; a kind of mad-dash catharsis of an action film surrounding a man with nothing to lose and only an hour to live. But from such a simple, promising novelty of a premise, filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor manage to convolute it with such misguided injections of style that, by its end, the film is just swirling vomit in a rotting toilet bowl.Jason Statham plays Chev Chelios, an assassin who's just woken up to a recorded DVD informing him that rival mobster Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) has injected him with the Beijing Cocktail. The cocktail is a poison that, if not counteracted with adrenaline, will kill Chev in less than an hour. So Chev must find Verona quick, and produce the adrenaline needed to stay alive long enough to find him.Crank is an exercise in style. Neveldine and Taylor work like they're the eighties lovechild of Tony Scott and Oliver Stone. Except, without the talent. It reeks of the rawness behind Oliver Stone's ears when he made Natural Born Killers. It's loud and mean and politically incorrect beyond imagination. At one point Chev yanks an innocent cabbie from his vehicle, throws him to the pavement, points at him and screams ""Al Qaeda!."" An elderly couple leaps from their table at a nearby café and starts beating the cabbie to a broken pulp while Chev commandeers the vehicle. This is Crank's sense of humor? Another supposedly comic scene has Eve (Amy Smart), Chev's girlfriend, being physically forced into sex in front of dozens of smiling, pointing Chinese onlookers in Chinatown.Putrid comedy aside, however, Crank still doesn't stand tall as an action flick. Its action is without distinction or interest; only random, never-ending barrages of bullets and beatings that flly in all directions. Mr. Statham is a talented, witty action hero. Why these filmmakers can't figure out how to properly utilize him is beyond me.Several years ago, Guy Ritchie put out a film called Snatch. The film's premise was fundamentally different from Crank's, but it shared the similarity of also being just an exercise in style. But Ritchie's style had character and speed, never willing to slow down to explain itself or apologize for the confusion it often wreaked. But as confused as we all got, Ritchie kept our pulses moving without resorting to the muck Crank lives in. This film is dirty and mean.

I don't know why Statham continues in this vein, the characters he plays are so one-dimensional.

The phrase ""action player"" as opposed to ""action actor"" seems obvious, why sound tongue-twisty or redundant all of the time? The latest vehicle transporting Statham's talents involves a gang war between Latinos and Triads, when his character is given a special synthetic poison that works faster when his pulse slows down - thus, the title ""Crank,"" as he has to keep finding thrills to CRANK his heart-rate! Creating a mini race-riot, doing private acts in the middle of a community square and even mutilating himself are some of the ways he keeps going, until his Doctor (played with laconic yet un-cowboy like charm by Country crooner Dwight Yoakoam) reveals he needs ephedrine or artificial adrenalin.The movie is even a mini-political commentary on the current socio-political status of the USA, when Statham's character wanted to steal a taxi he used the crowd to detain the driver, taking advantage of the cabbie's origins.Apart from Statham's quest and quirks, there is the use of multi-media in this gory yet campy and pulse-pounding thriller - the use of Google Earth to show locations of the heroine, villains, etc. was very unusual; as certain phrases were uttered you could see them in reverse in mid-air even as point-of-view shifted; or the classic line ""Do I look as though I have .... tattooed on my forehead?""

""Crank"" is not for the prudish, faint-of-heart nor a great chick-flick unless she appreciates blood, guns, sex and action in massive clumps flung one after the other until the film is over...It may not satisfy all Statham fans completely, but it gives them something to hold on to until we're transported to 2008, when the sequel to ""The Italian job"" has been completed! http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",Crank

This one of those movies that will annoy the heck out of reviewers and make parents ashamed that their kids snuck into see it (and they will). Crank feels a lot like a 83 minute live version of Grand Theft Auto, but its much more than that... OK maybe its not. I have a hard time explaining just why I think this was a good movie, it lacks most things that make a movie great, the plot is very simplistic, there are no ""hero"" characters, there is no moral high ground, yet it was fun to watch and worth a second viewing, I get the impression that the DVD will have more action since I'm sure the MPAA wanted this to be NC-17. The movie will make you cringe, howl with laughter and cheer for a hit-man, kind of like in Mel Gibson's ""Payback"". Some may call this a popcorn action flick and it is, but compared to most summer popcorn action flicks this one use habanero sauce instead of butter for the corn.

So my brother and I thought we would at least laugh throughout this movie as it could be like a Transporter 3. We walked out of the theater with a wide grin on our face. This movie was brilliant.Jason Statham was very good as the first two minutes of the movie we know what the whole movie will end up being. He finds out he has a poison in him and the only way to keep himself alive is to do outrageous acts to keep his adrenalin up. My personally favorite scenes were Statham standing on the motorcycle than purposely crashing it and him purposely starting a fight with black people.This movie was right on. It wasn't really a typical movie that results in a typical ending. It was well written and you never knew what to expect next. You also got to see Efran Ramiriez in a different role and he also was very funny (though I heard he is in a b-movie called Rave or something).Watch this movie for lots of action and lots of comedy.

141,moimoichan6,Video game kills the cinema stars.,7,28 March 2007,"Pitch : Your name is Chev Chelios : you're an assassin, a bloody murderer, executioner's style, for the US West Coast Mafia, who has now become the number one target of the Chinese Triad for having killed the wrong guy. In fact, you're already dead : your lethal enemy, Carlito, has injected you a poison in your sleep (yeah, that's Carlito's way), that'll stop your heart beating in less than one hour... unless you constantly keep your adrenaline level rising. And it starts really good, 'cause right now, you're really angry. In order to help you, you'll have to find everything that could rises your adrenaline : including all kinds of drugs, from cocaine to Jamaican's, killing people, robbing Red Bull from grocery stores, creating gigantic car chasing in malls with the police, destroying an entire hospital with no regard for the patients in order to find Epinephrine, and having sex in the middle of Chinatown. The good news is that you're in L.A. and you'll find all the adrenaline you want if you know where to look at. The bad news is that you've got very little time and plenty of things to do : kill the SOB that killed you, cleared the situation with your former boss, say goodbye to your girlfriend, and eventually find an antidote. And the all city might be against you, and looking for you, from the cops who wants you in jail, to the all gangsters of L.A. who wants you dead for the mess you're creating.The game : This video game starts immediately : no time for a real story here, for, as soon as a first scene informed you of your critical situation, in a subjective Doom-like sequence, you're out on the street and you'll better kill them all. The characters have indeed the personalities of a GTA Vice City video game, witch is rather shallow, but the movie also has the tone and the action of it, witch, on the contrary, is an excellent thing. For the all think is a video game without any reality, the movie also has no limits. It's absolutely Rock's Roll (with great Punk Music all the way, and the film itself is as fast as a Punk Rock song : it only lasts 73 minutes...) and politically incorrect (if you want to get rid of a Cab Driver, who speaks English with subtitles, just pretends that he's Al-Quaida, he'll disappear very quickly), and, most important of all, it's never serious and always hilarious. If that might be the stupidest movie I saw this year, it's also, from very far, the funniest. I was so amazed by the amorality of this movie, that it was hard for me to believe it was an American one : how could they have gone through the censorship with all that ? The Rules : There's very little rules, but you have to understand that you're in a video game world, an accept its logic to appreciates the movie, its action scenes, and its humor. If you familiar with Duke Nucken, GTA or Carmagedon, it might help. And if you like the South Park humor style packed in a action movie, you'll really rapidly get into it and enjoy the game. But my advice is to take a try of this Chinese S**t and enter the party no matter what, because, for f**k's sake this certainly is one of this movie that are to be called cult in a few year (unlike the sad and boring ""Snake on a plane"", witch claimed itself its cultiness, and has, in the end, no interest at all...) So, does a new player enters the game ?",Crank
142,TerminalMadness,"So bad, it's good...",7,6 September 2006,"I know someone in Hollywood got a hold of a concept for a video game called ""Crank,"" and thought that this was too good to be some stupid old video game. So, they made it into a movie. Because ""Crank"" is essentially set up like a video game. Our hero gets up, watches a video that lays out the plot, and now he has to find the people who wronged him.In order to stop the poison, get epinephrine. Level two: Get Epinephrine. Find the villain's brother. Level three: Find him and fight him. Keep your heart rate up, Level Four: Steal a police cycle and drive as fast as you can before your heart slows down; avoid pedestrians and environment. The mob is after you now that you're alive and may go after your girlfriend. Level Five: Get your girlfriend out of her apartment, without getting her killed. It's blatant, and ridiculous, and formulaic, but I had a good time. ""Crank"" is very much like ""Speed"" except with a human body as a bomb.Chevy has just awoken to discover his body has been injected by a rival gang with a poison that, if his heart stops beating fast, will kill him. This is not only the plot, but it gives the movie an excuse to be fast paced and without much characterization. ""Crank"" is so bad that it's good, and that's because of Statham's entertaining turn as a mobster who just had the worst revenge committed on him. What do you not do to get back at a psychotic mobster? Fill him with adrenaline.And that's the worst mistake his rivals commit when they pump him with a poison that will kill him if he doesn't keep going. And most of the film is Chevy's journey to keep his heart pumping, and boy do the methods get creative! ""Crank"" doesn't have much of a plot, it's merely just a sequence of events that resemble a plot in which our hero Chevy must roam around the city causing rampage to keep his heart beating, and in turn it helps him live his life, and face what might happen if he doesn't get the antidote if there is one.Statham seems to be having a good time kicking ass and destroying property, while the direction from Mark Neveldine, and Brian Taylor is utterly chaotic. The direction never calms down because the movie never calms down and brings about some utterly hilarious situations that you'll get a kick out of, if you don't put too much stock into what you're watching. I had a blast at this good bad film, and Statham comes through once again.",Crank

I picked up the movie and right from the beginning I realized it wasn't just ""out there"" in concept, but in your viewing experience. You have a wild ride following Chev as he fights to stay alive from the poison flowing throughout his body. He has two objectives:1- He has to see his girlfriend 2- He must make who did this to him pay.You will not be disappointment with the action and there is plenty of dark humor along the way.

Deliriously brainless with a great turn from Jason Statham as the lunatic anti-hero lead (Chev Chelios  what a name!), this is possibly the absolute antithesis of the chick-flick. And, therefore, is excellent! Crunching violence, great stunts, comedy sex  the only thing lacking (and disappointingly so) was a series of inexplicable explosions (you know, when a car does anything more vigorous then scratch the paintwork they usually blow up in films), but I can forgive that when the overall movie is so stupidly great.

146,Ansango,Interesting premise but bad execution......,6,25 November 2014,"Crank is a raw action movie.It is not among the usual mindless action flicks.The premise of the movie is really unique and enjoyable but fades due to its bad execution.It is the movie about a hit-man who is injected with a drug which will slowly kill him by stopping his heart.In order to stay alive he has to be active and keep his adrenaline level high.He breaks havoc in the city and get in fight with other gangster.Overall the story is very good and the idea is unique.I really appreciate the director for choosing such a different story.But as compared to the story on paper the story on screen is not good enough.In acting department Jason statham is good as usual.He essayed the role of a badass and carried it handsomely.Emy was also very good.The dialogues of the movie were humorous.It was an action movie but i think action sequences were not up to the mark.Usual car chase,fighting with goons alone and shooting them without got shot are some of the things which we see in every film and this one is no exception.They should have tried something new.This movie is filled with violence,drug scenes,sex scenes and strong language so its not for kids.I have heard a lot about this movie but i after watching it i am disappointed.Such a brilliant idea has been wasted.Still a hardcore action movie lover may like.In my opinion its comic dialogues were far better than the blunt action scenes.Overall not up to the expectation. 6.2 out of 10 would be enough.",Crank
147,cafesmitty,Herky-Jerky and then some,6,3 September 2006,"Straham is a hit-man who has been poisoned and he must kept his adrenaline flowing to keep alive. While watching this film, you may need Dramamine. It is a bunch of quick cuts to assimilate fast pace action, to bring you into the intensity that the character is going through. But it is too much. The movie never really focus on one thing long enough to get a good look. Its kind of like taking a magazine full of ads and rapidly flipping through the pages. Even when the camera is on one person, it moves up and down the person body and surroundings as if you are on a boat being tossed around by a violent storm. You just want off.The movie could have been a lot more enjoyable if the editing had been better, because it is pretty funny. Amy Smart, who plays the dumb blonde girlfriend, is nice to look at but doesn't really get to do anything in the film. Jason Straham is a very gifted athlete but he doesn't get to show off his fighting style in this film because it's all about how intense the director can make the action look like. That's it. What if you had absolutely nothing to bind you to behave in society? You can do what you want when you want and consequences be deviled. I think I know why this film is called CRANK, it because IMPULSE was already taken. I am not saying the film is bad, but it could have been and should have been a lot better.",Crank

It keeps the film moving and the viewer entertained at the same time at the ridiculous and extreme scenarios and this is all the directors want Crank to do.

152,pookey56,"x-rated review; Crank me baby, Pul-eez!!",10,2 September 2006,"now here's a film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits start rolling! Fast out of the gate, calling this an action film seems like an hilarious understatement. I've been watching Jason Stathan since he was an Olympic diving champion. Yes; i am a fan of his. I may not like all of his films, but i like him, and i've watched him in all of his movies. This one is a wild ride, nothing held back, completely tongue in cheek, and not one for mom dad and the kids. There is gory violence, hot and spontaneous (there is method in his madness) sex, humour, and hyper activity to the max. Crank is the perfect metaphor. The film is a rushy non-stop film that doesn't stop because Chev Chelios cant stop. If he stops, he dies. He's been injected with ""a Chinese drug"" that is fatal, and only adrenaline can slow down it's progress. I didn't get a chance to stop and ponder whether i liked what i was watching because something was happening in every frame. Just like being on speed (not that i have first hand experience...). A moot point since ya, i liked this film!Amy Smart ( the butterfly effect, smith, starsky and hutch) was delightful as Chev's girlfriend Eve. Very sexy, unaware of what Chev does for a living, and wonderful comic relief. Her character has the pleasant side effect of letting us get a glimpse of Chev's character as well. A hit man who wants to give it all up for her.The human hand was used as a recurring motif as well: a chopped- off hand, a hand with the fingers blown off, a waffle- ironed hand, and a hand under the needle of a sewing machine. I had the feeling Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor were giving us a hand job. The cinematography i've seen before, something akin to an episode of CSI, but i don't watch CSI. What i will do though, is watch Crank again. Just seeing Statham's ass would have been enough for me... During the film, we keep being told that the ""chinese drug"" is fatal, that Chev is going to die. Which reminds me; Dwight Yoakam plays Chev's doctor, Doc Miles, the only character that appears to be moving at normal speed; and he's literally in perpetual flight. Chev wants to stay alive as long as he can, and uses all kinds of things to keep his adrenaline high, snorting cocaine, using a ""haitian plant"", nose spray, running, having sex (i love that sex scene, people...)shooting an over dose of epinephrine, drinking red bull...whatever he can get his sexy MAN hands on. Crank had a great ending too, because we are left wondering if this is truly the end for Crank. It certainly would be for anyone else. But Crank isn't just anybody; not by a mile. This film is destined to be a major hit. They cant make a sequel without Jason Statham....they jabbed him with a syringe...and didn't i see his eyes open at the end?...this is one for the DVD library, and the perfect thing for Spike TV, It may not be for everybody, but one cant help but be pulled along with this rushy film. i for one was very glad for it...a rushy, sensual satire!",Crank
153,Supachewy,Crank Will Get You Cranked,5,26 August 2010,"The adrenaline pumping action film Crank is directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor and stars Jason Statham and Amy Smart. The film takes place in modern day New York city.The films starts off with Chev Chelios (Statham) waking up and finding a DVD. On this DVD he finds out that a man known as Verona has injected him with a drug that is going to kill him. The reason he did this is because of the hit Chelios pulled where he killed a very powerful man named Don Kim. After speaking with his doctor he finds out that he has been injected with a drug that will kill him unless he is able to keep his adrenaline up. The rest of the film is him trying to achieve revenge with the help of his girlfriend Eve (Smart) and his gay friend Kaylo.The plot for this film is very thin. It is basically a revenge film filled with violence and sex. At some points it is funny how over the top it is and the writers Neveldine and Taylor know that so they keep going for it. If their goal was to make up a straight up action movie that is trying to make fun of itself at the same time then they achieved their goal. Not as complex as most action movies plot wise but still an enjoyably entertaining script.The direction of this film is by far the best part of it. Extremely stylistic that makes you feel what Chelios is feeling. The direction made me feel like an adrenaline junkie who just did a lot of cocaine who is on a killing spree. It is absolutely crazy, just great. Neveldine and Taylor I think have the potential to be great directors. If they write a really solid script I think they could be nominated for an Oscar. These two are definitely directors to keep an eye on.The acting in this film by the leads was quite good. Statham truly is a great action star, one of the best out today. He is just so cool and his accent really works. He is just terrific as the adrenaline junkie lead. Smart was very good as Eve, the girlfriend. She was over the top which brought some laughs to the film. Obviously it is not really a part for an actress to show off her acting abilities but she gave as good of a performance that one could give to that part. The rest of the cast was over the top, no one was really great. Overall a decent acted film.I would give this film a strong 6/10 just because the direction was so unique and great as was Statham as the lead. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes a pure action film.",Crank
154,IRateFilms,Rockstar Productions Would Be Proud.,5,8 October 2006,"A film that knows no boundaries, Crank is action from the very first frame, until the very last. Never taking itself too seriously Crank puts us right into the action, without the usual boring beginning. Instead of boring us with a fifteen to twenty minute plot setup that usually commences with today's action films, Jason Statham is immediately put into the deadly situation he spends the rest of the film trying to survive. Injected with the ""Beijing cocktail"" Statham goes through every type of adrenaline pumping drug, legal or not, that he can find in order to stay alive. Crank, although being low brow entertainment, does use very interesting camera work, and new edge fast cut editing. Being a guilty pleasure, Crank simply surpasses its competition by actually doing the thinking for you. Exploiting every gangster movie cliché, Crank displays the kind of sinful, stylish carnage that keeps you watching even though you don't really know why. Statham does perfect the action start he has become with The Transporter franchise, and tears through the screen like Evil Knievil through a ring of fire. During all the action an eighty's rock soundtrack just gets you into the film even more, enhancing the refreshingly sinister sense of humor gushing from every frame.",Crank
155,puttputtk,one of the most ridiculous movies ever made... but it works,7,7 October 2010,"Crank (2006)Crank is a strange movie to review. Its really a strange movie all together. It seems like the writer and director said ""lets make a movie with truly non-stop action,"" and in the end that's what they had.I can't really say I think it's a good movie, because I don't. However I do enjoy it. Crank is the only movie I've seen that really is non-stop action. Right from the beginning the action starts and its tense right to the last second. With the camera angles and movement of the camera even the parts where people are just talking seems tense and almost action like. I don't think the film is all that well done in the long run though. It definitely works but it isn't really good. The story is probably the most ridiculous story ever and the cinematography often times looks pretty armature. The acting is decent from Jason Statham considering what he was doing, but the rest of the cast were pretty lame and didn't seem to try that hard. So its hard to give a rating to this film. Do I go with how much I like it or how much it deserves? If you are in the mood for a real hardcore action movie Crank is your best choice, it makes action films like XXX look tame. On the other hand, if you are looking for an action movie that I feel is more of an actual good movie this isn't the way to go. Bad storyline, acting, writing, dialog, directing, and so on but somehow it's a lot of fun. Even though I bashed the film a bit, it's still a very original and fun film, and can be enjoyed when you are just looking for a straight up, true action film.7/10",Crank
156,plpregent,Chev Chelios is the new John McClane,7,20 October 2011,"Yes, you can find some true action movie awesomeness in Crank. And trust me, I know how it is to be nostalgic when it comes to childhood heroes.I grew up watching action films during the 80s and the 90s. So, to me, it's all about a bruised up hero, big guns aplenty, stunts, badass one-liners, bad guys looking meaner than Charles Manson, etc.Films like the Die Hard trilogy, Predator, Broken Arrow, Hard Target, The Last Boyscout, etc, have paved my childhood and my teens. Not only did they feature memorable characters and movie magic, their direction seemed a little less flashy but focusing on the right things (geography being a good example).So, to me, action films nowadays have lost a bit of their appeal, especially blockbusters.Crank could have been your typical MTV-style, new millennium movie derivate. But it's not.It does have all the elements of the aforementioned film category : choppy and flashy editing, ever-moving camera, a hip soundtrack, and many other things that usually seem to irritate me a little bit.In this case, it's so well assumed, and delivered in a no-holds-barred, in-your-face, balls-to-the-wall manner that I did find the now rarefied awesomeness that I'm constantly seeking in an action film in Crank.It never takes itself seriously. This film showcases stuff that's sillier than a video game and manages to provide you with some great laughs as well. It kinda laughs at itself for being what it is, an overly-stylized actioner that's too sexy for its shirt.This is an entertaining ride with a frenetic pace that will leave you pumped up, and you'll walk out the theatre almost looking to pick a fight with a pure stranger. To me, Jason Statham made it as a modern action icon with this film. You gotta love Chev Chelios, he is one hard-to-kill motherf...This is probably the first big Hollywood hit that I've seen making a genuine use of this new-generation style of directing. It does serve the story, and generates the whole rush. This film spits at every possible stereotype by making it a caricature, and ruthlessly kills them all, whether it's a type of character or something as deep as the directing.Mad props for the ending...it's the icing on the cake.Hats off to a bad-to-the-bone film that delivers unexpected goods, while serving an audience craving for good old action movie awesomeness.",Crank
157,maxmik,Jason gives an Oscar-worthy performance,10,5 September 2006,POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: Jason Statham has always been an interesting actor but in Crank he is given a part he can really sink his teeth into. He rises to the occasion. From first to last scene he gives his all. Although Crank is nothing more than a video game Jason endows it with his humanity. The villains are not very interesting but his leading lady Amy Smart is the perfect balance to Jason's manic edge. In two scenes in particular she gives ditsy blond new meaning. The first scene is in a restaurant where she gets the hiccups - one of the best restaurant scenes since Meg Ryan had an orgasm in When Harry Meant Sally. The second scene is in the middle of L.A.'s Chinatown where she consents to having public sex. Dwight Yokum as a Dr. Feelgood is also effective. But it is Jason who is front & center & who delivers the goods. Bravo.,Crank
158,mozli,"A funny, disturbing dark video game cartoon",9,28 July 2008,"Most of the positive reviews have already said what's needed to be said about this film. It's down and dirty and has no shame. It probably got that R-rating by splitting a cat's whisker. Its definitely a type of softcore porn. I don't have a problem with that. I have to say Amy Smart showed some sides I wasn't expecting. I don't expect her to go on to do films a wild as this as a habit but she showed that she'll take a dare. Now the harder questions: Is the film racist? Is the film sexist? Is there anything redeeming or qualifiable as art here? The character is a bigot and a macho pig yet the film is arty as hell. What saves the character is that he has made the decision to walk away from it all and the conversation(?) in the elevator with the elderly Asian gent. It would be too much to call this a cautionary tale. Anyone this caught up in THE LIFE won't see this movie in time or won't know how to take it seriously. It does feel like GTA(video game) but with a ending that is OTT and real at the same time. It also shared a bit of the sensibility of DeNiro's double blast at reality TV, SHOWTIME and 15 MINUTES. There are big nods to the silent film actors like Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd in some of the tableaux the director and writers set up and Statham executes. Great soundtrack as well.",Crank

160,larry.launders,A LOT of fun!,7,5 September 2006,"Think of it as pure fun. An action movie about a guy who has to keep his adrenaline running to counter the effects of the Beijing Cocktail he's been given comes across the screen as steady direction lends very good pacing to this movie. Without that this movie would have been an absolute disaster.Jason Statham is not breaking any molds in this one, instead he sticks to being Jason Statham and fortunately that works very well for the story. There are some inventive camera tricks here and there that keep the movie visually interesting and at times humorous.Everybody sells their character well, and yes you'll probably feel like you've seen a similar movie before. Think along the lines of DOA meets Run Lola Run meets Transporter2 (yet done FAR better!) meets...well you get the idea.Not a lot of moralizing here, but there is a noble thread to the plot. The over-the-top quality of the action and story line make some things forgivable and lend to a higher sense of enjoyment out of this movie if you just let it take you for a ride.",Crank
161,Gezzerboy,Very average,5,18 October 2006,Being a fan of the transporter 1 (not 2) i was looking forward to this and as usual the trailer looked wicked. Well sorry to say what a bore fest.Jason Statham plays a hit-man who is injected with a poison which is slowly killing him. The only thing that can slow it down is Adrenaline.Some good car chases but apart from that I didn't like the tongue in cheek comedy Jason tried to do and felt the film would have been much better with a straight script and lots more fighting.I wouldn't bother paying money to go cinema with this one. Maybe a DVD rental at best,Crank
162,filmnut1,Wild conceptual redux for a forgotten 1996 actioner.,10,12 August 2006,"Back in the 1990s British action star Gary Daniels was at the height of his fame. Headlining a string of bland, stunt filled features for PM Entertainment (the B Simpson/Bruckheimer). In 1996 he starred in RAGE, a non-stop action movie with a very ""high concept"" premise. Injected with a deadly drug an ordinary man becomes a one man army. Hunting down the bad guys, on the run from the cops and trying to get his normal life back - the film was stunt filled madness. 10 years later we have CRANK which is essentially a rehash. Albeit a big budget, MTV-style version. Our hero is still a Brit, the location is once again Los Angeles, but there are gangster movie connotations, wild visuals and a tongue-in-cheek tone (you cannot take the name Chev Chelios seriously and I don't think you're supposed to) which makes this a lively, engaging ride which knocks Daniels' effort for six. The similarities between the two cannot be ignored but this is clearly the superior of the two. RAGE was the prototype, but CRANK takes it to the limit with set-pieces and jokes as silly as they are inventive. In addition there are connotations to films such as Tony Scott's MAN ON FIRE and DOMINO and Brit gangster movies such as Mike Hodges' GET CARTER and Guy Ritchie's LOCK, STOCK and TWO SMOKING BARRELS which add to the thrills and keep us entertained. Much more restrained than CGI-filled, action pantomime that was TRANSPORTER 2, CRANK is Statham's best star vehicle yet. He's a pure physical presence with a maniacal glint in his eyes. There are no Corey Yeun-style martial arts scenes but it doesn't matter. The film is OTT but somehow grounded. The action is rough, fierce. Statham's character is a relentless one man army in classic tradition. Young guys and longtime action movie fans are going to love this for its sheer vigour. With creativity in the genre previously limited to new twists on chases and fight scenes, it's a real pleasure to see films such as CRANK, ONG-BAK and BANLIEUE 13 (District 13) emerging. Not to be taken too seriously, Crank is one of the best popcorn movies of 2006.",Crank
163,OllieZ,Could have been much better.,5,15 April 2007,"What a waste. I thought I was going to get a balls-out action film; tense, tight and rock'n'rolling. Instead, I got an MTV, teenage semen sweat fest.Alright, maybe I am being harsh. But this film should have been much better. The pacing was wrong, the action didn't have enough oomph and it just wasn't that fun.Statham is good in the film, as Chev Chelios, a man who has to keep his adrenaline levels up to stay alive long enough for a cure. This is a great idea - Speed on the cardiovascular system.The director took the wrong direction for this film. I know the whole manic rushing and flashy editing was done to show the anxiety of the character, but it just ended up looking a mess. The ending was atrocious as well.The film would have benefited from a tighter script. For a film about rushing, the film wasn't very action packed or thrilling. Admittedly, some of the scenes were done well, but this is a missed opportunity.Imagine this film remade with more efficiency, more thrills and a better use of Los Angeles - surely one of the most under developed characters in the film.Watch it once for some good action scenes, but if you are like me, and like pacing and action in good measure, you might get angry watching this confused effort.",Crank
164,CMUltra,He has one hour to live. I'd like two hours of my life back.,4,18 February 2007,"What a disappointment. I really look forward to Jason Statham movies as he has all the tools to be a major action star. He is fit, projects a great screen charisma and knows enough martial arts to allow for nicely choreographed fight scenes. But his movies continue to be weak. Well, his previous movies seemed weak at the time but, compared to this stinker, they rocked.He may have jumped at this movie based on the script. I can imagine getting excited just reading the screenplay. The premise is not original by any means, but still nifty: he wakes up with a video love note from enemy gangsters letting him know that he has one hour to live due to a designer poison in his system. A nice touch was the video showing them administering the drug while he was asleep. There is apparently no cure but the death can be delayed by keeping his adrenaline up. The script then lends itself to what could have been nicely over-the-top moments involving him starting fights he cannot hope to win, having sex with his girlfriend in front of a cheering crowd of Chinatown onlookers, mutilating himself with a waffle iron, starting police chases and generally embarking on what the news station in the movie called a city-wide spree of destruction.All of these scenes with so much potential were wasted in the unimaginative hands of director Mark Neveldine. He goes through every clichéd tool available: fast edits, fast pans, odd tilts, slow-mo, etc., all supported by a fast, generic soundtrack. Okay, granted, pretty much all action movies use these tools but, in the good ones, the directors use them imaginatively and well. Neveldine did neither. If the Cardinal Sin of any movie is to boring, how much worse is it for an action movie to suffer that? The movie is barely workable. I don't believe it even lends itself to the enjoyment of picking it apart with friends. Statham does maintain his favorable screen presence, but very little else. Amy Smart is not terribly attractive here. That's got to be the movie as she looks charming in other venues (see: The Best Man and Just Friends, though she was out-shined by Anna Faris in the latter). Efren Ramirez is always enjoyable, including his violently brief role here. For much better examples of his talent see Napolean Dynamite and Employee of the Month.I'd really recommend a pass on this movie.",Crank

Dwight Yoakam is awesome and just hilarious as Statham's Doctor/advisor.
This movie is fittingly raw at times and that's ok.

166,brodie_kashmir,"Pure, Non-Stop, Unadulterated Action... I loved it",8,31 December 2006,"Non-stop action fused with comedy highlight the new Jason Statham vehicle, Crank, which gets your adrenaline pumping till you want to explode. It's an interesting and totally unique concept. But why was I experiencing deja-vu? Chev Chelios (Statham) is a hit man who has just been hit with a slow acting poison known as the Beijing cocktail, which blocks the adrenal glands, effectively cutting off your natural resting supply of adrenaline. In order stay alive and exact his vengeance upon the Latino crime lords who sentenced him to death, Chelios has to stay moving to pump out abnormal amounts of adrenaline, and goes so far as to overdose on epinephrine (artificial adrenaline) and get a full defibrillator shock to the heart.It's an action film in the purest sense of the term. It fills all 83 minutes of its unusually short run time with action that never stops, which works in favor of rookie writer/directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. In fact, I don't even mind the short runtime, because any more of all that running and fighting would have been just too much to handle, even for hardcore adrenaline junkies.Jason Statham has this natural talent of portraying this big, tough, intimidating man that you wouldn't want to cross, and then he cracks a joke without cracking a smile which makes him seem much more down to earth, though still intimidating. And that type of energy was brought to the whole production. It's a big tough action film from start to finish, but jokes around without dropping the overall serious tone, keeping the audience reminded that no matter what, he's going to die.And the ending isn't the real payoff of the film. In recent years, a lot of emphasis has been placed on the surprise or shock twist ending of a film that will leave you asking ""what the hell?' (thanks to The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects). But for Crank, it's the journey to the end that makes the movie satisfying. It's like a roller-coaster. You laugh and scream the whole way through, not just at the end when you come into the unloading platform.While this was Statham's film, it wouldn't have worked as well without the great supporting cast around him. Amy Smart takes what could have been a throwaway role of Chelios' girlfriend, but turned into an impressive performance, keeping up with Statham's humour. And you can't help but recognize and acknowledge the talent of perennial scene stealer Efren Ramirez (Napoleon Dynamite).But while it is a genuinely enjoyable film, I can't help but think I've seen this before. Neveldine and Taylor seemed to have taken a cue from former Statham collaborator Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino before him on the visual style. Hype-noir action/comedies that aren't made by Ritchie or Tarantino have the misfortune of being compared against the films of the British auteur and his American predecessor. They each set/matched the standard of which all films of the genre are going to be compared for a long time to come. Whether or not it's justified in this case, too much suggests direct influence to not warrant the comparison. It's that, or it just seems like Speed, only in a person instead of a bus.",Crank
167,jon2005,Crank,8,4 April 2007,"Jason Statham is fast becoming the new king of B-movie action films; the two Transporter films, Cellular, and now this, easily the best of the lot. Whereas The Transporter and its sequel were daft and tried to be serious, Crank relishes in its own preposterousness. And how could such a film actually be taken seriously? One look at the synopsis and you instinctively know that this is another popcorn flick. But it's a bloody one good at that.Infected by a synthetic Chinese poison, awesomely named hit-man Chev Chelios must kill those responsible before the poison kills him. In order to slow the effects of the poison down, he must keep his adrenaline pumping, increasing his heart rate; slow down, and he dies. Thus begins the virtually non-stop action that keeps going right up until the end credits. Indeed, the film and its plot are intrinsically linked  just like Chelios slowing down will result in his death, the film itself would surely die if it were to slow down. We would start seeing plot holes, acting shortcomings, and start questioning all the crazy action sequences.Then again, that's entirely the point. The film doesn't slow down, and the audience simply doesn't have the time to read into things too deeply before the film moves on and such moments are gone  and we're not supposed to question it, because that's exactly what makes the film so entertaining to watch. Switch off your brain and the chances are you'll enjoy this more than most popcorn films of recent times. You know you are watching a popcorn flick when its protagonist spends twenty minutes running around the city in a hospital gown with a giant erection, before taunting a motorcycle cop and stealing his bike which he proceeds to ride by standing on the saddle with his arms outstretched. The lengths to which Chelios will go to keep his adrenalin pumping is where the film is at its funniest, and most inspirational. Robbing a store and clearing out all the Red Bulls, defibrillating himself, and having sex with his girlfriend in the middle of Chinatown are just some of the examples  and there are plenty more. Jason Statham is perfect for the role of Chelios  he can certainly handle all the physical stuff the film throws at him, and he's just the right kind of person for the role, just going with it like a more 'serious' actor wouldn't. The rest of the cast are functional, but to analyse the acting and script is purely pointless. It's the action that Crank thrives on, and the fact that it embraces its ideas and does not chicken out half way through works to its credit.First time directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor throw in some nifty effects and camera-work, though sometimes the editing can be a little too much. The humour is a perfect counterbalance to the brutal action, both taking the extreme route to audience pleasing. It doesn't pause to take breath, and neither will the audience. It's not long, so get the adrenaline rush while you can.Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",Crank
168,patomartinezfgo,Perfectly over the top,7,19 May 2017,"""Crank"" stars Jason Statham as a hit-man who gets poisoned with a liquid that will kill you if you don't have a high adrenaline level. Which means that he must do all kinds of crazy sh*t to be able to keep it high. As you can see this is the PERFECT setup for a fun action movie. You have the excuse to do whatever you want because it is to keep his adrenaline level high.Let me start with the direction and cinematography. The movie is shot in a so over- the-top way that it makes you feel like the character. Super close-ups and weird color grading selections. Everything makes you feel like if you are having an adrenaline rush which is exactly the point.The music also sets up the tone very quickly with high intensity rock and some old tunes from the 80's.There is some humour in the film, which I was not expecting. But it was a pleasant surprise since it was actually funny.Jason Statham gives a good performance as you might expect. He really is the only one who could pull off this character in the correct way.The production value of this movie is laughable. There are some things that look so fake that you have to laugh. Specially one in which he is falling. There are also some shots taken straight from google earth and they even leave the watermark on, its hilarious.Of course the script and character depth are sh*t but I was expecting that. I was just looking for a fun action movie with some guns and adrenaline inducing scenes and I got just that.",Crank
169,chimera3,Sharp Wit+Nonstop Action=Awesomeness,10,6 October 2017,"My title for this review pretty much says it all. I don't know how I became acquainted with this gritty gem, but I must say that I am glad that I got to knowing it. When I first got into this, I really didn't know what to make of it because I was not that used to many of Jason Statham's movies. The movies of his that I did watch before this (""Ghosts of Mars"" and ""War,"" just to name a couple) were not anything to write home about. This, on the other hand, is.In my opinion, this is like a lost episode of ""Mission Impossible."" Why? Well, the home movie that Chev Chelios views contains details about what happened to him. Then he consults his doctor friend to figure out how to stay alive. Throughout the movie, he keeps in close contact with the doctor all the while fighting off the villains and spending some time with his girlfriend. As stated, it almost reads like ""Mission Impossible"" in some unique way not known to man.Let's not forget some of the dialogue that gets thrown around. When my brother and I first watched this, we were rolling on the floor laughing. The one-liners are memorable. Granted this movie would never get any awards (most action movies almost never do), it is definitely good for a barrel of laughs. Jason's reputation as an action junkie definitely shows here and it is definitely something to write home about. If you're having a bad day and feel like punching something, watch this movie for a bit of inspiration.",Crank

It is not for the faint of heart, whether your heart is filled with a vicious Chinese toxin or not, or the squeamish, if a lopped off hand or two or a missing finger causes umbrage, well this typical Chinese toxin movie is not for you. Cartoon violence, music video visuals, Jason Statham doing his best London wide boy bad ass walk toward the camera with humped backed menace turn, toplessness at any pause in the action, and lots of funny one liners amid the gore.

Lots of absurd butt kicking, absurd chases with numerous types of vehicles, absurd explosions, absurd gun play, etc. etc., ad nauseum. I'm kind of tired of it. This film was a twisted version of ""Speed"". I got this film free because it was a guaranteed availability at the local store, but when I went there the other day they were out of stock. They gave me a chit for a free rental which I used last night. I want my chit back. This movie doesn't fly for me and I think that for anyone but a die hard action fan, it won't work for you either.

172,gring0,"Don't think, just enjoy",8,26 June 2008,"Many of the criticisms levelled at this movie come from those who apparently can't accept a movie that never intended to take itself seriously. This film was certainly a pleasant surprise. I had only seen 'The bank Job' the week earlier which I quite enjoyed, and the prospect of another Statham movie was obviously an appealing prospect. My main concern was that leaving for England after an eight-year absence during which time a diet of Stathamesque movies provided an unremittingly dismal view of the country now, but as this is set in the Excited States, my worries were groundless. The action is completely over the top, plot ridiculous (although living in Beijing, this is the ideal location to pick up a lethal disease), stereotypes out in force, lack of any characters to identify with where odd eccentricities tried to cover up what effort on character development lacked, and blatant rip-offs of Pulp Fiction (fathers sticking family heirlooms up arses, etc) and other genre films could not overcome the adrenalin and enjoyment. I think the scene with the defibrillators is an homage to Once Upon a Time in the West myself. Often I found myself literally on the edge of my seat,looking at my mate in incredulity. I cannot remember the last film I saw which made me want to devote a chunk of my salary to drinking all the Red Bull I could in an hour and seeing the results. Apart from completely unbelievable deus ex machinas which demand too much of a suspension of belief, and an idiotic girlfriend thrown in that, while initially succeeding in providing a laugh, soon becomes annoying and slows the pace, this is a film I'd watch again. www.tracesofevil.blogspot.com",Crank
173,create,Yawn,1,3 September 2006,"What happens when you cross a stupid mobster with two unbelievable henchmen? Crank. Jason Statham and Jose Pablo Cantillo play the dummy henchmen Chev Chelios and Ronny Verona. They are in the middle of a bitch fight as the movie begins, and we have to suffer through them doing it again for ninety minutes. Verona injects Chelios with with a special poison, and then announces to Chev that he has an hour to SCREW with Ronny's life. Then Verona whines like a spoiled child when Chev does it. The effects in the film are so cheesy. They are of the blink and you'd miss it variety-- except, you don't have to blink. The film cuts away from the graphic scenes, and then highlights the end result--showing you nothing. And strangely enough, for a film with a lot of slicing and dicing...what happened to the blood? In one scene, some guy's arm is chopped off (no, you do not see it get chopped off), and he doesn't bleed. In another scene, a character is in free fall, and it looks like they shot him leaning off a building. If the filmmakers can't stomach the violence that they direct, perhaps they should imagine a different film. Give Brian DePalma credit. If he was going to delve into the world of these people, he was going to show you their depravity.It could be possible that this film cost money, but most of it was put in Statham's pocket.

177,tomq5p,Offensive and absurd,1,10 September 2006,"Let me start by saying that I usually like crazy action movies with plots that are an afterthought. ""Crank,"" however, was a ridiculous mess, a waste of time, and offensive on top of that. Jason Statham plays the same character he always plays. Everyone else in the movie is essentially an archetype. The portrayal of people of color and women is standard, which is by no means a good thing. At one point Chev Chelios (Statham's character) pulls a Middle Eastern driver out of his taxi and yells ""Al Qaeda."" Then a group of people viciously attack the taxi driver as Chelios steals his car. That scene is pretty representative of the film and its depth. There are a wide variety of racist portrayals and comments. Chelios forces his girlfriend to have sex public. She resists but then loves it and starts asking for more. Typical. There is plenty of the now common, but still annoying and detractive, product placement. The plot is barely worth discussing. Basically Chelios has been injected with a Bejing Cocktail, a drug that slowly kills a person unless the person's adrenaline levels stay at an abnormally high level. So, he has to do outrageous things to keep himself alive. At the same time, he has to get revenge on the people responsible for administering the drug. The action sequences are okay. They aren't that impressive compared to say, The Protector, which is also in theaters as I write this and is considerably better. There ARE some good special effects and gore, if you are into that. Now, some might argue that the film is really a comedy/satire. The completely impossible and outrageous ending would suggest as much. If this is the case, the movie is better, but not by much. It remains offensive and lacking. Plus, it seems doubtful that the intention was to create a clever satirical film which actually poked fun at other movies starring Jason Statham but cast him as the main character also. Sure, it's possible that the people behind this movie meant for it to be taken as big joke and I simply didn't get it, but I sincerely doubt that. 1 out of 10",Crank

179,james_norman1981,Like the man who fell out of the penthouse of a skyscraper...,7,4 September 2006,"...And every floor down said: 'So far so good,' Crank is a movie about a guy with a pretty much guaranteed death by the end of the film but who seeks to see the current upside in that his unavoidable termination hasn't happened quite yet...! However, whereas our apocryphal skyscraper observer might seek to reflect on the good things that have happened in his life, Jason Statham's brilliantly named Chev Chelios is not one to accept the inevitable quietly.Chevy is a hit man who wakes up the morning after his latest job, which went off with nary a hitch before the film begins, with a bad feeling of near-deathliness. A saunter to the giant TV of his incredible apartment reveals a DVD nearby which he is instructed to play, in no uncertain terms. Turning on the home movie reveals a junior hit-man plus his buddies, the idea of a lone, silent, inconspicuous but deadly assassin like Leon clearly having never occurred to the characters in this film. These guys have killed Chelios the night before. However, they have used a Chinese poison that blocks the adrenaline receptors in his body, or something, the science is only vaguely alluded to and in terms that suggest the writers have read the idea somewhere but can't quite remember the nitty gritty. Regardless, Chevy is destined for a slow, agonising death as his heart slowly stops... unless he keeps his excitement levels up.Before you can say adrenaline junkie Chev is driving like a maniac to beat up a pub full of black men and snort cocaine off their bathroom floor. Yes, Chelios quickly realises, with a little help from a bizarre doctor character whose relationship with Chelios doesn't really make much sense, that the way to survive is to keep pushing his body to produce adrenaline, hence the increasingly outlandish stunts and situations he finds himself in. Like the doctor character the story suffers from huge plot holes and doesn't really make that much sense, but neither does driving your car through a mall, flipping it onto an escalator and fleeing the scene... yet it's still entertaining...Crank is all about the entertainment. There's scarcely a serious moment in it and most of the actors seem to be having a ball with their tongue in cheek roles. Amy Smart is sexy but goofy as Chelios' dimwitted but gorgeous girlfriend Eve, who quickly finds herself up against it, in more ways than one, as she gets dragged into the reality of his murky life. Cantillo is OK as the man who has killed Chevy but now finds his target gunning for him. Sanz does the oily, greasy big bad boss thing pretty well and Toakam, as the doctor, is refreshingly open and laconic about Chelios' problems. Sure, other than Smart and Statham I've never heard of any of these guys, but they do their jobs well with the right level of wry amusement.This leaves Statham near permanently on centre stage and fortunately he's pretty damn good there. Having showed he can do the whole laddish thing in Lock Stock and Snatch, while the two Transporter films demonstrated his action credentials, Crank gives Statham his first decent leading man role and he fits into it as if it were tailor made for him, particularly as he doesn't have to use his nauseatingly bad American accent this time. He perfectly encapsulates the kind of hip-hop gangster hit-man his character is, someone way off of reality but which the audience is prepared to accept because he's cool without being too in your face.Chelios drives and runs around the city of LA with his goal of revenge against his murderers firmly in mind while also seeking out the doctor for any sort of potential cure. We see the darkness at the centre of his life and his desire to start anew with the hapless Eve, but also his absolute conviction that revenge is completely vital. There are laughs galore as well as fine tuned action and the two writer/directors, Neveldine and Taylor, whose backgrounds are in stunt work and music videos, deliver it all pretty quickly. A couple of their jumpy effects annoyed me and they could've done with a little more coherency in places but, given that this film came out of nowhere really, they've done a bang up job.All in all Crank is a great, fun movie. It's not going to trouble anyone come the awards season, save perhaps MTv, but that's not necessarily a bad thing as, in my recent memory, I can't remember a film that was so purely entertaining. I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes their action... although be warned, the occasional sight of Statham's arse sticking out from his hospital gown are not for the faint hearted!",Crank

Everything about the film - be it the characters,the stunts or the situations - is so OTT that suspension of belief is mandatory.One is expected to just go along for the ride as one incredible incident after another unfolds at breakneck speed! Watch it in the right spirit..and you won't be disappointed!",Crank
182,unknown07,Transporter Part 20,1,18 April 2010,"This movie could be another transporter sequel. All it needs is a title change. The Transporter guy plays the same person in every movie! But his movies are all way over the top with bullsh*t stunts that are totally impossible and stupid. This movie has pushed B.S. to a new level unmatched by even the most ridiculous action movies. First of all, what is with the sex scenes? The stupid rape-like act in chinatown, then his slut girlfriend doing the face in his crotch thing while he's driving, then wiping her mouth. These scenes weren't funny, they were disgusting. And since when do helicopters reach an altitude of about 35,000 feet in 5 seconds? And how can he make a calm phone call and be heard through the wind noise as he falls to the ground? I know there's a sequel but I haven't seen it yet, so even though he bounces off a car and hits the pavement after falling from a helicopter, he lives. Movies need some realism to be enjoyed. This has NONE. What sane person wouldn't GO TO THE HOSPITAL is they found out they'd been poisoned? You need revenge? Go to the hospital where they can save you and then get revenge. Don't go to the hospital and shoot at cops while demanding drugs.And why the hell do cab drivers give him rides and drugs and never ask for money? In conclusion, this movie has sexually deviant scenes for no reason, and is cheap and unrealistic. Obviously it was made in L.A. in order to maximize it's cheapness, and resembles some gay foreign film more than it does an American action movie. Maybe that's why it's so stupid.",Crank

185,deltajuliet,"Eh, not worth seeing",7,1 September 2006,"I think I had a spot of Snakes on a Plane Syndrome when I saw the trailer for this. It's premise seemed so corny and such a blatantly open excuse to have violence, drugs, sex, etc, it must be good on a stupid level.Well, some parts were funny; Statham and a Middle-Eastern cab driver have a disagreement, so Statham throws him out of the cab and yells ""Al Qaeda! Al Qaeda!"" until a group of angry people form an angry mob and Statham slips out of the scene by stealing the cab. Also keep an eye out for Linkin Park's Chester Bennington as an apparent drug abuser.Mostly, though, it was disappointing. It was pretty corny at times, but not in a way that made it good, like SoaP. Action was lacking, and not very good anyway because scenes were always being butchered by quick cuts, shaky camera, subtitles (what's with subtitles?), etc, etc.The ending was a bit reminiscent of Vanilla Sky, which I liked, but the end of the end was pretty cheesy. Google also seemed to get in on this project, as one can see at one of numerous times in the film in which a map of the city is layed out with Google written in the corner.All in all, it wasn't very good, but not bad enough to be good, either. I don't often say this, but save your money on this one; it's not worth it.",Crank

There are a few scenes that are better left unseen because they ruined the whole movie. The idea is original, but the overall vision is blurred. They could of executed the story line a lot better. If your a guy's guy who is just looking for some brute action, and a public sex scene, then this movie might be for you. However, if you enjoy movies with substance and emotion. Movies that can actually make you feel some kind of emotion for the character, then this movie is not for you. I feel that this movie fell short of what it promised to deliver. And the only thing that is appealing is the fast paced world of action that he lives in. Everything else is just kind of pointless.",Crank

The script is basically stolen straight from Escape from New York, but what the heck its still good. Don't let the kids watch it for sure.

188,redsoxmb545-1,Crank Kills and Thrills!,9,15 September 2006,"Crank is a high paced, action packed thriller starring Jason Statham as Chev Chelios, a hit-man, who wakes up one day to find out that he's been injected with a Chinese poison that will constantly drop his heart rate until he's dead. Chelios must 'crank' his adrenaline level up in anyway possible (i.e. energy drinks, cocaine, and public sex with his girlfriend (Amy Smart)), while trying to find an antidote and track down the bad guys who injected him (Think 'Speed' but with a person!). Statham fits the role perfectly and takes you on an extreme and mind-blowing ride that never looks back. The camera work and overall style in the film is very unique and highly resembles that of Tarantino's Natural Born Killers. The plot runs a little thin at times, but the constant action and entertainment value makes up for it. This is definitely a 'guy' film. I wouldn't recommend taking a girl to this movie at all (some exceptions of course). In some aspects, it's a little like the Transporter movies with a hard R rating. If you're looking for a fast ride with tons of action (and plenty of violence), Crank will give you exactly what you're looking for.",Crank

My Favourite,8,13 March 2021,"The stupid, unrealistic, paper-thin premise of this film is that our 'hero' has been injected with a synthetic poison that kills you if you don't keep your adrenalin levels up. He wants to get the people that injected him before he dies, but in order not to buy the farm he needs to stay pumped by fighting people, stealing cars and ingesting energy drinks and cocaine.And that's it. The whole point of this film is to give Jason Statham an excuse to be surreal and inconsiderate to a slew of sleazy gangster types for an hour an a half... and that's exactly what he does!Is it good? Yes. Crank does precisely what it sets out to do: show as much darkly funny carnage and destruction as it can before imploding in a hail of bullets. I'd have put a spoiler warning here but anyone who can't surmise the denouement from the synopsis and presence of this particular leading gentleman has a discarded bathroom sponge for a brain and therefore must have bigger problems in their everyday life than getting the end of Crank spoiled for them.This is not art. This is not a profound cogitation on the nature of man's existence. It's barely a film, to be honest. What is it, though, is funny and silly and pointless and sort of gobsmackingly shameless.

195,hereontheoutside,No film has felt like a bigger waste of time since I accidentally saw The Santa Clause,4,16 July 2007,"Crank has been reviewed over and over as a 'high octane' or 'most fun you'll have at the movies' kind of film. Contrary to what cliché-ridden reviewers and mindless thrill seekers may tell you, this film is a little hollow. It has the climactic thrills or driving your friend to the hospital as he has a heart attack only to find out that all he needed was a couple Gas-X and to quit eating pizza three times a day.From the first the film spins, buzzes, warps and pulses through one day in the life of Chev Chelios, a hit man for the mob who has been murdered, kind of. He's been injected with a poison that should kill him in one hour. The film follows his frantic last day as he seeks to do right be his girlfriend while simultaneously reaping his merciless revenge on everyone who has done him wrong. The energy rarely wanes throughout the film's arduous hour and a half. The writer/director team of Neveldine and Taylor penned this masterpiece in four days (as they boast on the commentary track); the screenplay feels like film school geeks who couldn't wait for the next Tarantino or Guy Ritchie film to be released so they decided to make a high octane film, devoid of plot, that pretends to weave many threads into the main vain. All of the subplots are really only breezed over though, making them feel thin. The story is fragile and asks a great leap of faith in the viewer to buy into this world. I hate reviews that only bash so I'm going to follow the old matriarchal proverb that begins, ""if you've got nothing nice to say"" and just end the review by saying, without giving the ending away, that a film this packed with action, senseless violence (that just doesn't entertain in the same way 'Oldboy' does) does not benefit from a sentimentalist, moderately surrealist ending that they give. It doesn't satisfy and leaves you wondering why you weren't reading a book, fostering a stray cat or volunteering at the local food pantry.",Crank
196,plotlessviolence,"Transporter 3 minus Kwai ""Corey"" Yuen",7,21 September 2006,"I really enjoyed Transporter 3 I mean Crank. It's got a good plot, moves very fast, and has just about the greatest setup for an action movie of all time. I also fully buy the explanation for why Statham was so specifically drugged: that his rival thought he was an adrenaline junkie, and he wanted Statham to die in the most ironically humiliating way possible.The biggest problem, though, is that Crank is NOT Tranporter 3, meaning Jet Li's usual stunt/fight choreographer, Kwai ""Corey"" Yuen of the Yuen brothers wasn't involved. So when it comes time for a fight scene, there isn't one. Instead Statham just runs up to the bad guy and snaps his neck in one move, even though it's virtually impossible to snap someone's neck (especially in midair when you're both falling...you need to brace yourself against the ground to get the inertia needed to rip the Trapezius muscle). In a world where Hard Boiled, The Killer, The Matrix, and Equilibrium have set the standard for gunfights with disarms and shootdodges, all Crank shows is people standing across from each other, pointing and shooting with no technique. The only cool move is what the main bad guy does when the grenade lands near him and he yells ""get down!"" So that's the real tragedy of Crank: it could have been the greatest action movie of all time except it didn't have any action.The other main problem is that there was no way to present a satisfactory ending. If Statham survives, it's cheesy, and if he dies, it's depressing. The scriptwriter didn't exactly solve this paradox.To nitpick, I didn't need an explanation of what the poison does every fifteen minutes. I got it from the trailer, thanks.Also, what's up with the name ""Chev Chelios."" If that's a reference to something, I don't get it.I still enjoyed it because the plot and humor stand up without the action, and the movie respects its adrenaline theme by not wasting the audience's time.",Crank
197,cannotlogon103,"A real surprise, in every respect",8,9 October 2006,"The way this movie was promoted, I was expecting pretty much a straight-forward ""action flick"", but was surprised to find the movie was so much more. Twisted, ironic, super-fast-paced and beautifully shot, ""Crank"" is a very clever little movie.Jason Statham brings the right amount of tough-guy bravado and wry humour to a role that if performed by an actor who took himself too seriously would never have worked (and it would be pretty hard to take yourself seriously as an actor when you spend about 20 minutes of the movie running all over LA in nothing but a hospital gown). Unlike his performance in ""The Transporter"" flicks (which were fun, to be sure), he is less the cock-sure action-figure, and actually turns in a surprisingly nuanced performance, closer in spirit to his pitch-perfect portrayal of Turkish in ""Snatch"".But it is Amy Smart who steals the show as his oblivious girlfriend -- she's cute, amorous and just off-kilter enough to make her a rather compelling character study. Her scene in the restaurant where Statham confesses that he is a hired killer, and she tries to take it all in, all the time trying to suppress a case of the hiccups is priceless, and you won't soon forget the scene where Statham and Smart have sex in a crowded pavilion before a hundred on-lookers.The underlying story of why Statham has been marked for death is lost in the frenetic blur of the movie, which entails Statham doing everything imaginable to keep his heart rate up so the poison he has been given won't be able to take effect. But that doesn't matter, as the fun of the movie is in watching Statham run rampant to pump up his adrenaline and stay alive long enough to exact revenge. Kudos to the writers/co-directors Mark Neveldine and Bryan Taylor for not copping out with a ""boy-gets-the-girl-and-lives-happily-ever-after"" ending that lesser, focus-group-satisfying auteurs might have offered. The movie ends on just the right note.The movie looks great, too -- interesting camera angles and cuts, terrific lighting and color, and a subtle yet effective ""psychedlic"" quality that illustrates Statham's panic-stricken run for his life.Don't be mislead by the pedestrian promotion of this movie; it genuinely is NOT your run-of-the-mill action movie.",Crank

It's depressingly bad with a lot of over the top stereotypes and horrible acting. Even movies in the most far out sci-fi category must have some believability to engage the viewer and create good enough fiction for the audience to stay in the movie. Well in this respect Crank fails completely because it's so ridiculously over the top and a majority of the action sequences really doesn't makes any sense. It's not simple to mention any other film that so completely loses touch with reality early on after just a few minutes of watching and then keeps going down the same track for 90 more minutes. It's a miracle I sat trough, but i got a couple of good laughs. And lets not mention the underdeveloped characters that makes cartoons look like serious literature, no let me just instead state the obvious fact that the writers and producers of this movie have spent far to much time with their X-boxes during their childhoods for their own good. If your requirements for an action movie are limited and you feel satisfied with a couple of shooting scenes and a fair amount of gore, then you'll love this flick but if you're not lobotomized then don't waste 90 minutes of your life on this crap.

Statham plays hit-man Chev Chelios whom we see in the beginning has been poisoned with drugs that will eventually stop his heart, cue an extremely fast paced film as we follow Chev on his quest to track down the gangsters who injected him. The fact that the movie moves so fast is both its strength and weakness - the violent jerky camera work and frantic editing obviously fit Chelios' frame of mind, as he has an hour to live and the speed of the story works because of this. However on the negative side eventually the manic camera work becomes tiresome,(the movie only runs in at 88 Min's)and in the end, i didn't really care for what happened to Chelios. add a very annoying performance by Chelios' girlfriend (and a laughably bad sex scene) Amy Smart (who clearly cant act) and the style over substance is prevalent here in lumps.

There is so much action and violent fight scenes and it is so fast paced because he literally has no time to slow down.The whole concept of the film is really entertaining and the fact that the action is just continuous makes it extremely gripping.

210,antidonnie,Fun...Fun Fun Fun...,7,13 September 2006,"***May Contain Possible Mild Spoilers***""Poison in his veins. Vengeance in his heart.""Crank, a high powered, very violent action flick that keeps it's high adrenaline rush through the entire film.Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is, or was going to be a, a long time retired hit-man. At the start of his new day, Chev was feeling real sh*ty. His eye site was all blurry, his heart was barley pumping, and he doesn't know what the hell is going on. He finds a DVD disc, which is labeled f ck u, that shows when he was poisoned with some Chinese stuff by Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo). Verona is a real bad ass, he injects the poison only after Chev was unconscious, like a dirty rat. Chev learns that he only has a hour to live until his heart dies down. Unless he can keep his adrenaline going fast he's a dead man, and that takes a lot of Red Bulls. Chev is the best hit-man in town, only until he let his previous nights target slip away in an effort to quit professional killing, and start a new life with his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart). The hot, smoking, air-headed, blonde girlfriend has no awareness of Chev's business, and he intended to keep it that way. Continuing, it is vital that Chev keeps moving to save his life, and to get his well deserved revenge on the people who did this, and the people he hates. At the same time causing all kinds of havoc all over the town and won't let anyone get in his way. Through the drugs, the shootings, the beating, the high speed chases, the running around in a hospital gown will having an erection, Chev seems to know what he's doing.I didn't know what was coming, for I did not know what Crank was about, but I was in the area, and Crank had the earliest showing. At first thought I was thinking the whole poison in his veins thing was only a warm up for the film before we get to the real stuff. So considering ""the whole poison in his veins thing"" was the bulk of the movie, it felt pretty short. Though in that time nothing was wasted, but some things were a little stupid/silly. You would to have to see the film to know what I mean, but I highly doubt Eve would be able to find Chev after leaving her in town. After their strangely sexy, public intercourse, but only to keep his adrenaline running of course.I like Jason Statham, he's really cool, he's got this threatening, but sometimes sweet energy to him that makes him appealing. That's why I like him in Cellular, and I think he should play Agent 47 in the upcoming Hit-man movie, not Vin Diesel. Eve wasn't a roll I was expecting Amy Smart to play. I know she's better than that, so she kinda stuck in the film, not to much. Besides her, everyone was perfectly cast.This film is one of the most ongoing action film I have seen, even if you might think it's a little silly or stupid, you won't be board. So I recommend Crank for just that reason.***/**** starsCrank (2006): Rated R for strong violence and language, some nudity, sexuality and drug use",Crank
211,zv300,"Absolutely AMAZING film, very UNDERRATED.",9,25 October 2006,"I know this was a great film because my heart is still racing from the fast -paced excitement! This film is so good, and so real I don't know where to start. I've heard some complaints the film is offensive to Blacks, women, Latino's, Asians and just about everybody, and for the most part that is true, but in being offensive to EVERYBODY it appears to me to be offensive to NOBODY. This is a film people either love or hate, and I suspect the ""haters"" are people over 40 and detached from the realities of life. This film is so kinetic and action-packed it is the first one in recent memory that pretty much keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole film. As usual, I won't bore you with the story as it's been reviewed ad-nauseum, but the story is fairly original and it's execution is VERY unorthodox. Mr. Stratham is a great actor and very underrated, as most action stars are. He has that dirty Aussie/Brit style that is unmistakable. He is one of the few white-boys that can go to the Black ghetto and get respect, that's how tough this guy is. He's got balls, he goes into a Black Biker gang bar with a dozen gun-toting thugs, and threatens THEM!! All the acting was good, people make these insipid comment like, ""this film won't win an Oscar"" and crap like that, but if it was up to me, it would. It's relatively easy to make these preachy Oscar contender films, try making a balls-to-the wall action flick with a big dose of emotion and it gets hard. And yes, this film had plenty of emotion as this guy has a girlfriend he loves but he is dying and won't be able to fulfill his promises he has made to her. This film is so hyper, and realistically portrays being hyped up and drugged up in your last hours of life. The gangsters are all ruthless and back-stabbing, but show emotion also. As for the effects, all looked VERY real, and I watch ultra-violent Asian flicks so I know about realistic effects and Crank lives up to their high-standards. Cranks is just really good and surprised me, nothing feels contrived or forced and although the subject matter is wild to some, it's realistic implementation is what makes it so good. I mean, his girlfriend looks like she is really having hiccups in one scene, the gangsters all make realistic gestures and the gritty street settings are not sanitized at all, it really looks like dirty LA. And the music is phenomenal, mostly 70's and 80's rock (when Rock was real Rock) and I don't even LIKE rock music, but it was played at the most appropriate times. Most kids these days were not even born, but the music is so cool and slammin it won't matter. His girlfriend is really cute, but she is not so cute it detracts from reality, she looks like she is a regular chick. And the ending, I have to rate it as one of the top five ending of all time, that's how good it was to me. In Strathams last moments of life, he calls his girlfriend and reflects on his past, noting that he should have ""stopped to smell the roses more often, but now it's too late"". It was very touching, I rate the ending right up there with the Korean film Joint Security Area, the music was extremely strong and appropriately Haunting. This is a must-see flick.",Crank
212,deavenger,Perfect,10,21 January 2007,"Perfect, Perfect, Perfect. This movie is just perfect. It's lots of violence and humor all mixed in. The result, a action/comedy movie starring Jason Statham, Amy Smart, and lots of scenes to be talking about tomorrow.Chev (Statham) is a hit-man who is poisoned with a Chinese poison which is slowly going to his heart. The only thing that is keeping him alive is adrenaline.The movie has lots of action, lots of humor, and lots of holy cow that awesome. The action is bloody and awesome, the humor is something you'll be laughing at days or even weeks later, and the end is the extreme holy cows through out. A must see for all action fans.",Crank

Afterwards, as we were leaving, he remarked, ""Well, that was not for the faint of heart."" To say the least.Hand chopped off? Check. Car abandoned on mall escalator? Check. Public semi-consensual rape? Check. Numerous car thefts and crashes, interspersed with cab and elevator rides in which a random Japanese businessman addresses the hero in the voice of the hero's mother? Check. Fast cuts, obscenity written in large caption letters across the hero's forehead, and completely improbable use of drugs? Check.I liked it very much. Fastest 90 minutes I've ever spent, and it was insane and funny.",Crank
214,MorganMan1,This movie is over the top!!,10,1 September 2006,"This movie is one of the best, most original action movies that I have seen in a long, long time. I enjoyed the movie so much because I was never quite sure what was going to happen next. It could have taken the easy road on several occasions and with a cliché scene. Instead it went over the top and offered a new twist on the chase scenes, the fight scenes, the love scenes and even the death scenes. If you like non stop action you will love this one. I like Jason Statham and really enjoyed him in the Transporter films. He is even better in this one. I would put this film up there with Pulp Fiction. To me this film has a fresh style and over the top scenes.",Crank
215,devinshee,"A funny, crazy action movie",9,26 February 2008,"Yes, Crank is quite like a video game, it is a lot like the Grand Theft Auto games. I like how the movie begins with the credits, when it shows the crank title with the 80's style arcade game look, and the heart beating, and the Bang Your Head song by Quiet Riot 80's music, that's something new, bringing back the good old days. I did not really care for the movie the first time i saw it, but when it came on T.V. I tend to like it more. It is action packed, pure adrenaline, and a lot of fun. It is very funny, I love how angry Jason Statham gets in the movie, always frustrated, he is loud and swears a lot, and he is funny in a classic way, and that goes for the rest of the cast. I think the Verona character was funny also, and he gets mad all the time too. Statham is always talking crap about Verona, and it makes Verona really want to kill Statham (known as Chev Chelios in the movie). It is a very rough movie, and some parts may be kind of cruel and mean spirited. The movie has a public sex scene that kind of pushed the envelope, but its kind of funny and makes you go ""Oh my god!"". The Statham character does anything he can do to keep his adrenaline up to prevent dying. As in driving fast, running, beating someone up, walking around everywhere, drinking energy drinks, medicine. And he hijacks a lot of vehicles too. And crashes cars and stuff, car chases, drives a car through a mall. The movie is pretty violent, it is somewhat bloody and gory, a guy's hand gets chopped off and gets his brains blown out. And a guys fingers get shot off. And a guy pretty much gets blown up by a grenade, some blood spurting, bloody wounds. Neck breaking sound effects, pretty brutal. There are some shootouts. And it it really cool seeing Statham falling at the end. It is a real guy movie, its kind of how movies used to be, it is old school (I sure say old school or old fashioned a lot in my reviews). It is like the movie Speed on foot. You will laugh all the time, it is fun. And it makes it a little more fun with all of its mixed up editing. I'm pretty much looking forward to the sequel, better be as good as the original. And the plot for the sequel sounds quite ridiculous, but I'm looking forward to it.",Crank
216,fiolvb,How is this not a cult movie?,10,10 October 2021,"If it came out today, it would probably be rated at 8.5/10 on IMDb.It is just a genius movie. Unique, original, better than an adrenaline shot.",Crank
217,brentsoffcenter,"Over the top action, with little breathing room",7,24 September 2006,"Of course, this is exactly what this film intends to deploy: non-stop action; and it does so with a rare ferocity. Stathem is great as an all action character, and certainly fills the bill with this latest installment. With an almost satirical, tongue-in-cheek approach, while fuming with anger at the same time, he accomplishes one mission after the next in perfect loose cannon order.Although somewhat contrived as an over all plot, the story line stimulates the imagination. Chevios battles insurmountable odds and leaves a swath of destruction through Los Angeles without blinking an eye. Action fans will admire this movie for innovation. But many may not appreciate it quite as much for the constant, no pause, incredible, over the top action sequences. There are also a few scenes which some may question their actual necessity or validity within the movie. As a pay-back, revenge oriented movie, this is one fine thrill ride film.",Crank
218,GodsPrototype,Please Insert Coins to Continue,9,14 April 2009,"Crank up the volume to ten and just go with it. It starts immediately the computer game inspired credits end and we are thrust into the main characters dilemmakeep his adrenaline ramped up to max or his heart will stop beatingwhat better concept can there be for an action movie! Some will say it's unbelievable but it's not meant to be an accurate portrayal of life it's a very funny and totally action packed movie and leave your logic at the door and just enjoy the chaos and the comedy throughout the film.This is much better that 'Shoot Em Up' of the same year as it just enjoys itself and you can tell that everyone involved in the film just had a blast making it. The key to this film lies in the comical aspect to the characters dilemma such as realising he's injected himself with way too much synthetic adrenalin and has to run as fast as he can anywhere dressed in a hospital gown.Although very cheesy but memorable is the scene in the shopping mall where the car crashes and flips onto a moving escalator and comedy is to found in the very public sex scene watched by a bus of Japanese school girls. I think that 'Crank' is better than Statham's other famous vehicle 'The Transporter' as it makes no excuses for itself as a shameless addition to the thousands of action films out there.The best thing though about this film is the fact that it is a real live video game played out in a film. Wait till after the end credits and you will know what I mean. Statham wakes up with a dilemma with his 'Mission' to kill the big boss but has to go through different 'Game' levels to reach the final level. He picks up energy & booster points on each level (Redbull/Cocaine/Fake adrenalin & a black drug dealer gives him ""The hardcore S***."") that enable him to continue.It is, as other reviewers have said, reminiscent of the Grand theft Auto games and Jason Statham has even got the video characters walk down to a tee. All this is surprising as the film has never been marketed in this way but all throughout the film you see little hints that it is a computer game, from the in-film 80's games to people talking on cell phones projected onto walls, the credits obviously & the constant ongoing adrenalin rush that can be associated with a good computer game.After the end credits roll you suddenly realise that this is not the end for Chev Chelios as to continue the Crank experience all you have to do is to 'Insert more coins to continue'. Of course this may be a little dig by the filmmakers complaining that they needed more money to make a sequel and I hope more coins are inserted so that I can 'Play' the character of Chev Chelios againbring on the sequel.This is easily in my Top Ten Action movies ever because of the sheer entertainment value for lots of action and damn good laughs. I totally recommend this to action buffs, video game fans and fans of high-concept entertainmentyou will not be let down. I could watch this film again and again, almost top marks for an action film as for what it attempts to do it does extremely well. 8/10",Crank
219,michaelplewa,Like spinners with spinners,8,4 October 2006,"The baroque MTV editing and sound effects only enhance the ""higher than high"" concept. I've seen DOA (the 50's version, which is no subtle thriller, though in a completely different way), SPEED and RUN LOLA RUN, all of which contribute to CRANK's mileu (spelling?) You see the trailer and you want speed, fun and explosions (there aren't many I can remember). What you get is a stylish thriller with plenty of adrenaline thrills all its own. The sex scene is a high mark for the writing team here. Statham exclaims, ""I'm Alive"" to a cheering crowd enjoying the spectacle. You know why he's excited, you know why they're excited, and you know that in some ways it's all the same thing. It's too bad a movie so devoted to the thrill of living has so much killing. I know you can't poison a guy who sells insurance and then expect him to go nutso-Matrix on your minions, you have to do it to a total badass. It just seems on final reflection (yeah, that applies here), there's a missed opportunity. However, if you blink you'll miss it, and that's why I'll watch this movie again and again.",Crank
220,jdfcanada,An instant classic!,9,7 September 2006,"Like a previous reviewer said, Crank is a non-stop roller coaster ride. It starts off with Chev Chelios finding out he's been poisoned with the ""Beijing Cocktail"", that slowly but surely drops your heart rate to zero, killing you. He's told to keep moving and keep his adrenaline flowing to fight off the poison. In doing so, he becomes a one man wrecking crew, demolishing shopping malls, cars, hotels, you name it. He fights people hand to hand, blows stuff up and shoots plenty of bad guys.One of the best things about the movie is the subtle humour in the background, like how most of the time he's calmly talking on his cell phone while in the middle of a car chase, gunfight or something else. His time in the hospital, running around in a gown is hilarious. There is tons of dark humour and great one liners throughout the movie, and the plot is breakneck. Amy Smart does a pretty good job of playing the part of his ditzy girlfriend, who's more concerned with turning off her waffle iron than escaping the bad guys.",Crank

Fantastic pacing, the acting was questionable from time to time but Statham does a great job like usual. Some of the side characters are so random that you cant help yourself and have a laugh. So many hilarious moments through this movie, you can pretty much classify it as a comedy.Has its faults, however, if you are fan of Stathams work & you have some friends coming over, watch this.

But here goes: The guy wakes up at the beginning, and watches a video where he learns that if his heartbeat rate goes too low, he'll die.Well, it's pretty much WYSIWYG from then on.Some people might miss this title, thinking it's basically ""Speed"" with a guy playing the role of the bus. Well they shouldn't, because there is a lot more in there. Yes, there are a lot more movies referenced. But the film makers are proud of their references, and they give them a royal treatment.How they managed to include splotches of humor, and genuine cinematographic art in such a ride is a mystery for me. I thought I was in for another one of Besson's ""Transporter"" kind of fluff, but how wrong I was.And on top of it all Statham's charisma literally drips off the screen!

223,sarm123,Enough to hold the attention and provide entertainment,7,19 October 2014,"The story of the movie ""Crank"" is centered around the mercenaries Chev Chelios who is a criminal organization Verona poisoned using deadly virus. With the help of his friend and doctor Miles, Chev discovers that the only way to survive is to maintain a high level of adrenaline in the body and forcing the heart to work as quickly as possible and pump blood. Chev searches for the excitements all around and chases the criminals who committed this to him to have their revenge. The story did not very well done. Crank us in the first 10 minutes provides an introduction, and then follow the fast-paced, dynamic and full action scenes. What movie lasts longer story becomes more complicated, but then see the story into the background, and to emphasis on action, which is starting to be even more brutal. Jason Statham excellent fits the description of the fierce and tough guy. Another unusual thing is the camera. Sometimes the screen into two parts and monitor two different actions. Sometimes an unusual angle accompany the hero. The division of the screen and I did not like, I was more irritating. While Chev race while recording or while riding a motorbike contributed to even greater impression. Movie is a very exciting, fast and dynamic, just like the main character. In some scenes there and the humor, which is good. At any moment did not boring. I definitely recommend this movie when you want some good action.",Crank
224,jimmykebab,Like ( I imagine) taking speed at thorpe park,10,7 October 2006,"OK...I've finally got around to reviewing this, and i gotta say this was the biggest surprise of the year. I went to see this the day it came out and had in mind a gritty actioner, i was anticipating something like the recent running scared. The credits began, and I was treated to a nifty sequence calling back to old coin op arcade games. Did this tell me much about the film? Well, um...the heart kinda did. From then on in, the film never lets up EVER. The frenetic camera work that kick starts Chev Chelios' rowdy day is just the beginning of the colossal head trip of this film.The plot is undeniably simple, he gets poisoned with a seemingly incurable disease and then rushes around trying to boost his adrenaline while looking for an antidote and revenge. The film moves so fast it is actually reminiscent of a roller-coaster, or something of that nature. Statham tears his way through the town and on the way bumps into and (most frequently) severely harms a host of deranged and wild characters and it is presented in an almost cartoonish fashion. As the movie progresses, the violence and debauchery increase and it all adds to the fun. And chev chelios is one of the coolest characters to grace our screens for a few years now, he just keeps on going.What I found in this film was pure escapism. Its simply fantastic, for a little under an hour and a half you can be sucked into this blisteringly hilarious actioner. Yes, it is quite possibly one of the funniest films ever too boot. The script is so well observed, and, i don't know maybe its in the British in me that felt a sense of national pride when Statham mouths off ""you f---ing toe rag"", inspired. The support is great too, Dwight yoakam is the ""doc"" and his various phone calls to chev are a hoot. There is also the main villain, a slightly inept hilariously temperamental character who always rises to Chev's bait. Chevs transsexual friend provides (at times) a slightly odd choice of side kick. Amy smart is also there, although i have a sneaking suspicion she only serves to be seen half naked, and to have sex in public. HAHAHA, i guess everyones heard about that by now, but she is actually good in the film though and adds a certain comedic charm to the film. And thats another thing, the film just not give a s--t, it is blatantly in your face and relentlessly un pc. And in this day and age of toeing the line of ""whats OK"", that just is great.So overall, at least give it a try, it might not be everyones cup of tea (i can see it appealing more to guys if I'm honest.....but thats not to say girls cant enjoy it) but it is what is an absolutely adrenaline fuelled(ha) riot.",Crank
225,DaMarco-2,Logic is cast to the wind for effect,3,5 September 2006,"It's perfectly all right for a film to defy logic if it takes us somewhere interesting. ""Face Off"" flew in the, well, face of logic, but it posed interesting questions about identity and revenge. That is not the case for ""Crank."" I like Jason Statham as much as the next person. He's sexy and swaggering and the perfect hero. You even like him in this as he is such a sweet boyfriend that he doesn't want to hurt his girlfriend's feelings by rushing her. Of course this idea is stolen from ""Pulp Fiction"" wherein Bruce Willis never wanted to rush his girlfriend, Maria de Medeiros, all the while being hounded by Ving Rhames.Quentin Tarrantino appropriated ideas from film noir and reassembled them into a collage; Guy Ritchie appropriated from Tarrantino and created a collage of a collage. This film is just a mish mash since the collage can't be deconstructed and reconstructed any further.Ideas are introduced and dropped. Continuity is a huge problem. At one point Statham is shot in the butt by one of the villains as he runs onto a freight elevator. Statham curses the man and fires back as he holds his wounded tail for the next couple of shots. Then suddenly the wound is no longer there and his butt is back to normal.This film is also that worst of all American clichés. Violence abounds graphically, yet when Statham and his girlfriend (played by Amy Smart) have sex in the middle of Chinatown, the shot of the act is coy and cautious, as though being made for TV. Like so many American films, ""Crank"" isn't the least bit afraid of brutal acts of violence, yet--this being an American film--the idea of nudity in sex is intimidating, even with a British leading man.Whereas Tarrantino and Ritchie have the good sense to confine their violence to the underworld of crime, the violence of this film seeps into the lives of everyday people, and hence loses our sympathy for the movie's hero. When a cab driver refuses to allow Statham in his cab because he is soaking wet Statham throws him to the ground, points at him and screams ""Al Quaeda"" in the middle of a crowded plaza. People then leap on the man and we hear his bones breaking. It's meant to be funny and--except for the young kids sitting near me who mistook the moment for something resonant--it isn't. It's just cruel like this whole movie.This is a mean film, a film that hates people and makes you hate the ones who populate this particular world. It has nothing to say, no original idea and no humor. It wastes a great leading man and a great idea with only some punchy (yet unoriginal) ideas toning up the direction.",Crank

227,sabenge,Modern day attempt at an exploitation film,4,6 February 2008,"Objectification of women, razor thin plot, action sequences that exist for no other reason than to celebrate their own presence, horrible dialogue, and an anti-hero who has virtually nothing revealed about him who serves as little more than a plot device to further said action sequences are basically the meat and potatoes of this 87 minute (93, uncut) film. Had this been made 30 years ago, it probably would have starred Sonny Chiba.I have to admit, within the first five minutes I almost gave up. The dialogue at the beginning is terribly juvenile and never gets any better. There is not one line that makes you think it's written by an adult. I persevered, though, only because the cinematography kept me interested. Mark Neveldine and Bryan Taylor did a well enough job of camera placement and editing to convey the rushed sense of the character without seeming too spastic. Half way through, they seemed to have given up on the random camera angles and went for a more conservative action movie approach. The score seemed to do the exact opposite; misplaced in the beginning and more relevant toward the end.Altogether, this movie kept me, at the very least, entertained. Is it worth buying? No. Is it worth renting? Depends on the price. I really hope that these two directors/writers have learned something from making this. I'm curious to see how their next attempt will fare.",Crank
228,mp65steady,Absolute junk,2,19 September 2006,"I can't believe this piece of junk is getting such high grades here. I've liked Jason Statham a lot as a sidekick in The Italian Job and especially as the hero in The Transporter (No. 2 even more than No. 1) and as a baddie in Cellular, which helped the B-movie to a rousing comeback in the last year. But although the premise was promising, ""Crank"" stank in a big way: The action was directed poorly and is absolutely no fun to look at, the dialogues and situations didn't have one ounce of wit, and the characters were so unsympathetic that I wished everyone was dead MUCH sooner - including Statham. Everything in the movie is so hopeless that you do not even have to point to Amy Smart, who gives a terribly misguided performance in a role for which she must have had her brains removed (or disabled) temporarily. And please don't bother to convince me that much of it should be considered ironic - moronic is much closer to it. What a waste!",Crank

The first half an hour is the worst - after that your mind gets completely numbed and switches off. There are a few laughs along the way (such as when Achy Breaky Heart comes on the radio in the taxi cab, or the sex scene), but they're really not worth the effort of paying to get in or staying to the end. In essence, this is nothing more sophisticated that a music video for a long and very boring compilation album.If someone had injected me with some Chinese synthetic poison before going into see this, I'd have done my best to sit quietly and let it kill me as soon as possible - hopefully way before the ridiculous ending.",Crank
230,darkharvey123,Preposterously entertaining!,8,28 January 2007,"If you like your action movies over the top and preposterously entertaining, you will certainly like CRANK. Like its doomed hero, the movie is pumped with adrenaline and just when it seems to slow down, it shifts into overdrive and delivers ample exemplary action scenes.The story follows a hit-man who is given a ""Beijing Cocktail"" after he doesn't follow his latest assignment and decides to retire. This cocktail is going to kill him; his only hope it to keep moving, keep his adrenaline going so that he won't die. It's all pretty hopeless for our antihero but he does do his best to keep both himself and the audience pumped up and ready to go.What makes this movie work is the deadpan but straight on performance from British actor Jason Statham (TRANSPORTER movies, CELLULAR). His fierce performance is just what the movie needs and he delivers. Amy Smart is also quite good as his somewhat addled girlfriend who finds herself embroiled in his plans.The movie also has a perversely funny script with tons of wonderful one-liners and sight gags. This movie moves and its final scene is quite harrowing. CRANK is the most fun I've had with action movies since DIE HARD.",Crank

Even the length of the film is perfect. At no point does the tension ease off.The transporter films were only OK but this is great. Would I see it again? Probably not - it's not that sort of film. Did I get a great evening out? Definitely.Regarding the rating - I found it pretty inoffensive. I can only assume that it got an 18 because of the language which is crazy because it is no worse than any 15 year old hears in the school playground every day. I found it particularly odd given that the last film I saw was ""Severance"" which only got a 15 even though it is much more gruesome and morally reprehensible.",Crank
232,ps42,They probably should have given him more of that Chinese s**t!,8,31 August 2006,"If ever a movie was made to get one's heart pumping, Crank is it. It takes a marginally believable and undeniably awesome premise, adds one of the brightest up-and-coming action stars around, stirs in some new ingredients that the genre hasn't really seen before, and bakes until the final product rises beyond all expectations. The catch phrase ""a thrill a minute"" doesn't really go the distance to describe how ridiculously action packed this film is. A thrill every ten to fifteen seconds is more like it. First time directors Mark Nedveldine and Brian Taylor relentlessly bash you over the head with the action hammer. Their cinematography is manic and the style is reminiscent of that used by Tony Scott in Domino. It fits the pace of the film quite well.Jason Statham delivers to audiences the only thing he knows how to deliver, and that is pure, distilled ass kicking. That is his job, and he is very, very good at it. Make no mistake, the film is very strongly 'R' rated. There is a bounty of flesh, and a strong smattering of violence, and drug use. Don't be thrown off by Amy Smart's name on the poster. Even though she does a fine job as Statham's on screen girlfriend Eve, hers (and every other) part takes a deliberate and distant backseat to Statham's charismatic portrayal of hit-man Chev Chelios. He also manages to wind more than a few threads of pretty solid humor into the performance. All in all, its Statham's most impressive job in a leading role yet.In a nutshell the plot revolves around Chev Chelios, poisoned by his employer after a hit went sour with a synthetic Chinese compound that blocks his adrenaline receptors. The only way for him to stay alive is to get pumped up and stay pumped up. Anything he can get his hands on to raise his adrenaline is fair game, from drugs to energy drinks to raunchy public sex and more as he tears a path of carnage and mayhem through the streets of L.A. in search of the man who tried to kill him.Crank is everything you could feasibly ask it to be and more. The filmmakers take an iffy premise, work their magic (read 'good casting and direction') on it, and produce reel after reel of pure adrenaline on film. It packs over the top action in with incredible stunts, clever and biting humor, a decent story and some above average acting. It's one of the most entertaining films of the year and may well be a career highlight for Statham. It's one of those films that you'll definitely want to go see with a bunch of the guys. What it lacks in depth, it makes up for in pure fun and distilled manliness. A high 8 out of 10.",Crank

And than we get scenes where the main actor calling someone for help and you see a girl giving a guy a blowjob while literary every scene when he does. Meanwhile, the movie is just plain boring without barely any action except a little bit towards the end. And the story made no sense either. Just a horrible movie all around, i don't recommend even getting from a friend who is nice enough to lend it to you for a week. This movie=Wanting to cry/or ripping ur head off at the end for wasting ur time on it. I don't like to call a movie one of the worst ever, but this one is honestly one that i do believe is.",Crank

It has humor and action - everything you want from a movie from that genre. I've read some comments about this movie and Im not agree that this is Trainspoting - continuation. Its different one. And the end is good. I love it - the movie is finished - no happy ending - great advertising for the poison in the blood of Chelios. Anyways I give it 6 of 10, because the movie is simple, clear and I don't have to think much. Totally clear and simple. But great. Nice action, great transitions between scenes, nice bloodbath, rude humor - just as i like.",Crank
235,bdonut,"brutally bad, preposterous and insulting to the action flick genre",3,18 September 2006,"It barely gets a ""3"" here as that's about all the good scenes you get in this train wreck of an action flick. Starting with the drawn by a 3 y/o ""Crank"" title credit then the zooming in on Statham's beating heart, this looked amateurish from the start. Add in MTV-like cut-and-jab cinematography that is nothing like Lock, Stock or Snatch, it was hard to focus on the damned screen. Statham also gets in a cab and the music he gets the cab driver to crank to keep his adrenalin up (and I kid you not) is Billy Ray Cyrus's Acky Breaky Heart. The worse was the idea he has to have sex right then and there in the middle of Chinatown...and people cheer him on. Who wrote this scene? Have they ever been to a Chinatown anywhere in the world or know of Chinese immigrants...let alone any people that would cheer on some dude banging a chick right there at high noon in full view of everyone. It was like watching Jodie Foster's gang rapists getting cheered on in The Accused. Insanity and insulting to any culture. Oh and some guy pushes another guy onto a grenade. They lie there one on the grenade. The other on top of that guy. The grenade goes off. Guy on bottom dies. Other guy runs away unscathed. Come on!The only actor worth his salt in this was Dwight Yoakum as the doc. I knew when someone who like MI3 told me to go see this, I should have stayed away. Even with a free ticket to this flick, I felt ripped off. I really should have walked out after 10 mins like about 6 other people did in the theater I saw this in.",Crank
236,rich-464,Should be rated 'ADD' instead of 'R',5,4 September 2006,"Crank is basically ""MTV-makes-an-action-movie"". I wasn't sure if I was watching a movie or the world's longest music video. While it was enjoyable, in the end the ""butter-flavored topping"" on your popcorn is more genuine and nutritious than this film.I'm not even sure it's an action movie - maybe we need a term like ""action comedy"" to describe it. What saved the movie from being a complete bust was the humor; it's very funny in a campy way. The plot is absurd, the cinematography is over the top, and the humor works because it's beyond sophomoric. The humor then is so central to the enjoyment of the movie that in the end I don't care about the main character, his girlfriend, their relationship, or who wanted him dead in the first place. The last point is beneficial, because I still don't know who wanted him dead.The camera angles were dizzying. ""Attention deficit directing"" is how I'd describe it. It was difficult at times to tell fantasy from reality - but hey, if the action's happening, who cares? Amy Smart plays the dumbest girlfriend in history, but his condescension toward her is cute and endearing. However, the much-ballyhooed sex scene (which is indeed hilarious) does not seem like an outgrowth of her presence in the movie. Instead it's the other way around - it feels as if they stuck her in the movie so they could have the sex scene.And that's how it feels for all the characters. They aren't real, they're props. But the movie moves so quickly, you don't have time to realize that there's nothing of substance on-screen.Do I recommend it? Depends on what you want. It's like cotton candy. Mostly air. No nutrition. But if you're at a carnival, you definitely should have some. So if you want mindlessly entertaining stimulation, go see this movie.But if you want a movie as smart as ""Die Hard"" or even ""Speed"", this isn't it. Because those movies were based on a smart good guy matching wits with a smart bad guy. ""Smart"" does not describe any of the characters in this movie.",Crank

And to think they actually made a sequel.If you like taking drugs and playing Grand Theft Auto then you'll probably like this. I found it baseless and offensive in the extreme. Too bad, I used to be (and sort of still am) a great fan of Jason Stratham, but he seems to be making the worst choices for movies of late.Honestly, if I was on the street and saw this guy doing the things he does in the film, I'd probably shoot him on the spot or run him over in my car. I'd probably get the Presidential Medal of Freedom for it.Any comparisons between this movie and real actioners like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon are somebody's idea of a joke.

But, my fiancé was dying to see it, and I am so glad I went! First of all, you will not be bored. This movie is only like an hour and a half long and it is non-stop action. It starts with Statham's character waking from a drug-induced sleep to find a video tape left for him by his druggers. They've injected him with a poison that should kill him within the hour. He consults his physician(played hysterically by Dwight Yoakam), who instructs him the only way to prolong his life at all is to keep his adrenaline flowing. Statham takes this advice to heart by driving cars through malls, having sex with his girlfriend in the middle of Chinatown, jumping fully clothed into a swimming pool, stealing drugs from a hospital, and cleaning out a convenience store of all it's Red Bull.

The plot is good and screen writing is Good it isn't predictable....At the end of the movie as he hits the ground he blinks and his heart starts beeping again I'm not sure if that means they are thinking about a sequel or not...

There is essentially no plot and the movie seems to ramble senselessly from one poorly done action sequence to the next. It is nearly impossible to keep a movie cranked ala Speed for an entire movie and this fails miserably. Even worse than the meandering weak plot which can be summarized as he's poisoned and seeks revenge, is the fact that the movie introduces a love relationship that no one feels and seems comic in its attempt at profundity. The end (no spoiler) is painful because it attempts to somehow make sense from all this nonsense and lend a deeper meaning suddenly to a character about which we really don't care at all about.

243,Lyceus,The worst movie I've ever seen - Let me explain why,1,24 May 2007,"I never wished to watch this movie, but I was on a long bus journey and the driver played a DVD with this movie and I didn't want to sleep (I should have slept and I wouldn't have wasted the time Crank lasted).'Crank' is a stupid movie whose plot is absolutely incredible. A professional murderer needs to continuously get adrenaline or otherwise he'll die because of a drug in his blood. This idea is silly, but the way the movie develops (mainly the stupid things he does to get adrenaline) is even worse. Let's see why I hated this movie so much (these are spoilers, but I hope by then you'll be clever enough not to see this movie if you haven't):-The only thing the main character can save his life is getting an exact dose of epinephrine. He tries to buy it at a hospital as if he was in a supermarket, the only thing he remembers about epinephrine is it starts by an E and he forgets the right dose. I wonder if he was that bad remembering the details of the murders he had to commit.-When his girlfriend discovers he's a professional murderer, she believes he's lying, but five minutes later she's really proud of what he does for a living.-He has sex twice in stupid situations, in order to get adrenaline: first, he tries to rape his girlfriend in a street full of people (she eventually agrees); second, when he's driving a car. That's when I realized at all that this movie had no logics and was a waste of time.-The end is probably the most stupid part of the movie: he pushes his enemy out of a helicopter, so they both fall. He calls his girlfriend and then he hits a car, bounces, falls onto the ground and blinks an eye. No comments.These details are good to see how bad the movie is, but 'Crank' itself is bad. The script is terrible and the scenes aren't interesting. Everything in the movie is stupid and very boring. The only way to properly describe this movie is saying it's bad, really bad.When the movie ended, the girl who was sat next to me said it was the worst movie she had ever seen. I could only agree, as everyone did.Please, never watch 'Crank' and try a good film or TV show instead.",Crank
244,shraysharma85,Adrenaline Rush throughout,7,22 April 2013,"While I was watching this movie, throughout I was thinking, would this guy ever be nominated for Oscar. Then i realised perhaps i m just being biased. But all in all Jason Statham, pulls off a brilliant act. The movie is fast paced, strong, and engrossing. Movie kicks off right from the word go and rushes on like a supernova. The direction and CINEMATOGRAPHY are truly a class apart. There were those moments in the movie where i felt my heart beat go up and down. The background score matches the storyline and visuals perfectly. It comes out as a perfect blend of a dish, which has been served, with nothing extra or raw left out in it. The movie has a great match of action and comedy, where the darkest of the scenes still turn out to be funny and don't cause a lot of trouble. One of the best Action Comedy flicks of all time, is definitely going to keep you glued. The performance Jose as verona is impressive, but truly statham carries the movie alone on his shoulders, its a class act. All in all the treatment of movie, the execution and storyline were pretty well knitted, to make it a good fun to watch.",Crank

It's actually the opposite. It will free your mind taking you all the way to your primitive instincts. And boy oh boy it delivers in some fashion.
All you have to do is let the movie work for you sitt back and relax, there's no reason to feel guilty.The unique style of the film makes it so great, all achieved by clever shots, hand picked cast, brilliant writing and directing.
This is simply not your average action movie.
I won't say anything more about it, in case some reads this review I don't want to spoil the movie as describing it requires so many words.Jason Statham even said that making this type of movie won't grant him any awards but he does them because people need them. He couldn't be more right.",Crank
246,invincible_irvine,One of the best guilty pleasures of this generation...,7,28 September 2006,"Before watching ""Crank,"" I had little knowledge of the plot and what to expect from the film. After watching the film, I must say that ""Crank"" is hands down one of the best guilty pleasures of this generation. Not since ""Old School"" has a film been enjoyed by guys all around the nation.Starring Jason Statham as Chev Chelios, the story begins with Chev waking up in a severely sluggish state, almost like he'd been drugged. In fact, he was drugged with a synthetic Chinese poison that slows the heart to a stop within an hour of injection. But Chev quickly learns that when he engages in a physical activity that increases blood circulation and heart rate, it slows the effect of the drug and gives him his normal energy.While awaiting the arrival of his doctor to do what he can to slow the effects using modern medicines, Chev sets out to keep himself as active as possible, the results of which are causing the most mayhem and destruction I've ever seen done by a single character in a single film! Crashing his car into a shopping mall, stealing bottles of nose spray and Red Bull, having sex with his girlfriend in public, running around town wearing nothing but a hospital robe, stealing a police motorcycle and causing more havoc with that are just a fraction of the high-octane energy that this film throws at a simply blinding rate.While I was watching the film, my conscious was screaming, ""How could anyone enjoy watching such wanton destruction of property and endangering the lives of innocent people?"" But in retrospect, what would I have done if it were me in that predicament? In that light, ""Crank"" is one of the most unique thrillers I've seen in many years; not since the likes of ""Total Recal,"" in fact.",Crank
247,nkaronis1,Not even Jason Statham can save this wreckage,2,21 October 2006,"I went to watch this movie because I like Jason Statham and wanted to enjoy a fast paced action flick. Everything fails in this one. From the first images you feel like you have been conned to watch a cheap video camera reel shot by a student. The music is annoying and the dialog is a compilation of the ""worse of you've heard before a thousand times"". Most of all, the worse aggravation are the bad guys. They usually make or break this kind of flick; here they are played by a bunch of untalented actors going over the top trying to mimic what has been done before by their betters with no clue or direction on how to achieve that.",Crank
248,sattaravy,Piece of Crap,1,15 April 2007,"This movie is simply crap. Nothing make sense, the plot, the acting, the entire load of rubbish from the promotion.I can't believe this piece of bullock still manage to get a 6.9 rating, instead topping the bottom 100 list where it belongs. What's everyone thinking? I'm not saying that movie needs to be intelligent or have a fantastic plot, but where movies like ""Dude where's my car"" and ""Bringing Down the House"" at least offer some pretty good laughs, this movie is just plan stupid and uncomfortable.Jason Statham is just the idiotic self as he's always been. I didn't expect anything from this stupid, ugly and self-centered person anyways. I was really sad to see Amy Smart involved though. Surely such a classy and talented actress, who were absolutely brilliant in Butterfly Effect, should have been much wiser in choosing her films. But seeing that she also appear in other cheap movies like Just Friends, maybe she ain't that brilliant after all.None of the plot in the movie make sense. Why would someone who is nearly dying still tries to contact his girlfriend (Despite him mentioning how much he loves her, no one can feel it as their performances were just crap)? That scene at China Town signals one of the lowest point as far as Hollywood comedies goes. The ending was crap, too, and I am not sure whether the director wanted to make this film an all action movie, a romance, a drama, or a comedy. It seems they never figured it out themselves.My Advice: Avoid this Piece of Sh*t.",Crank
249,Cineastin,The ultimate action movie,7,27 September 2006,"Well, I liked watching action movies a lot ultimately. Now I won't ever need to again. For me, ""Crank"" is an action movie that no other can keep up with. It's brutal, funny, totally crazy, ironic, wild, sexy (and sexist), cruel and very, very, very fast. Its ""plot"" is THE perfect idea for an action movie - I wonder why it came to nobody's mind before: The protagonist needs adrenaline to stay alive. This allows him to run/drive riot in a mall and even a hospital, beat up a black guy in a club full of blacks (as a white!) and f*ck his girlfriend on the streets of Chinatown, and other stuff. No action fan should miss it. But I've got a hint for the girls: This movie is not suitable for people under 18 years? This movie is not suitable for women, either. It shows women only as decoration or sexual objects - inclusively Amy Smart in the only female role that kind of matters, Chev's girlfriend, who is nothing but a caricature of a naive girly. But the casting people did a good job: Jason Statham as Chev, the calm killer, always stays likable no matter how brutally he acts, and Chev's girlfriend Eve, his (former) boss Carlito, his gay little helper, his enemy and murderer Ricky Verona are all original and convincing, no matter how exaggerated the characters are. And did I forget to mention the screenplay and the camera? Good job, you guys!",Crank
250,macvader999,boom!,9,18 February 2007,"Wow! If you are a fan of Jason Statham movies then you'll love Crank. The first thing that came to mind as I watched the film was that it was the Transporter on crack or some type of amazingly good drug. I'm thrilled it actually has a 6.9 too because tons of great action movies on this site get the shaft, rating wise. Anyhow, the plot is quite simple and probably implausible (but who cares it's a freaking action movie). Statham as Chev Chelios has been poisoned and can only stay alive by keeping up his adrenaline. Due to this, the movie moves very rapidly with Statham doing whatever he can, from provoking fights to having sex in public, to keep up his heart rate. Statham, while at times appearing callous, is able to mix some quick wit into the energy seeking Chev as he pursues those responsible for poisoning him. So, if you're in the mood for an action-packed film with a small dose of drugs and sex on the side then I suggest you go out and watch Crank.",Crank

252,xp_trinity,Hilarious and enjoyable,9,6 October 2006,"A couple of friends and colleagues recommended this film. My best friend said: ""go and see it, you'll love it"". I said I thought it would be another idiotic action film but then he told me it's with Jason Statham and that was pretty much enough of a recommendation. Then my friend said the plot was as if written by Tarantino himself and I rushed to the nearest cinema. Statham aside (yes, I really like the guy), it was enough to just listen to the dialogue and watch carefully. This film would probably never get an award from Cannes or an Oscar, but would most likely achieve a cult status and remain one of the best films of the year. ""Crank"" somehow managed to make fun of the action genre as a whole. It is so tongue-in-cheek that it is almost unbelievable. From the beginning to the end it was so full of action clichés that it was incredibly funny. At some points I was laughing so hard that I choked on my popcorn and people started turning their heads. I guess I was in the right mindset to sit and watch 87 minutes of nonstop action. I must disagree with some of the previous comments that this is a sexist film for guys only. Well, maybe not all girls will like it, but there was something endearing in the way Chev was treating his sweet girlfriend, which would appeal to many. Yes, not all women are stupid and naiive, but a smart woman would've had him figured out from the beginning. And of course, there is Jason Sthatam in the lead. So, people, if you want to spend 87 just enjoying yourselves by watching a funny film and eating popcorn and drinking beer (yes, we get beer in our cinemas), go and see it. If you want a serious film - watch a European one.",Crank

Much like previous film such as ""Running Scared"" and ""Natural Born Killer"", (horrible movies) The film tries to explain the reason behind the violence and want to make you think it's depicted as art. How can this garbage be art? The movie is about a man who found out he's injected with poison, if his heart rate goes down to a certain point, he'll die. He decide to take revenge on the people who injected him, so his heart rate'll stay up. Sound good? Sorry, This movie is no ""Speed"" More like ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"". One of the big similarity between these two movie is the shaking camera. You may think it gives the film more realism, but all it does is remind you there's a camera. The MTV style editing is also annoying. There's not a single shot that last more than two seconds. One of the biggest problem with the movie is that the plot gets lost in 15 minutes, isn't he suppose to revenge on the people who injected him? But instead he kills people randomly, mess around with the police.

Crank ends up taking ""non-stop action"" to a whole new level as the movie doesn't slow down at any point. It was so fast paced that it makes The Transporter look like a docudrama. The plot was decent and didn't involve too many annoying details, but the originality of the movie was in its practically complete absence of any serious, over-dramatic or thought-provoking scenes. Crank sticks to action and adds some great comedy on top of it, notably a very unique (and very public) sex scene. Laughs, crazy fights, sex, explosions are what make a great action flick and this is ALL that Crank really is, albeit at about 100 mph ! I really recommend seeing this one, especially if your going with a bunch of your friends. 10/10",Crank
261,SinisterDreamMaker,Intense. Vertigo Suffers Be Warned,10,7 September 2006,"Jason Statham simply made this movie what it is, which is a funny look at something that is pretty dark. This movie is seriously a rush, I know most movie critics use that line for almost every stupid action movie that comes out but this movie is really tiring to watch. Yes the movie is violent, but most action movies are and it has a ""R"" rating for a reason people. But none of the violence to me seemed sense-less Statham's character is on the edge, and about to die he has nothing to loose and what person out there would not be 1. p---ed off if they were poisoned like he was and 2. would do what ever it takes to get back at the people who did it to them? The fact that Statham's character is a hit-man also has a lot to do with the violence, all he knows how to do is kill, it makes the most sense to him so that is how he is going to go about handling the conflict. The directing/editing was fast and erratic at times, but it was only that way when it needed to be to add to what Statham's character was feeling at the time. When it comes down to it this movie was directed like a long music video, but that really doesn't ruin the movie if anything I think it makes it funnier at times, it is done in a way that isn't annoying. All in all if you are a Jason Statham fan, and like some truly intense action with a good deal of comedy mixed in this movie is for you.",Crank

Don't expect much realism, but, hey this is an action picture and it doesn't get so far into the silly realm of unrealistic as some others can.The main character has been given a lethal poison and has an hour to live. During that hour he must get his revenge, say good bye to his girlfriend, and go out with style.He does all three. This film starts strong, grabs you by the ***** and keeps going to the end. It has some good funny parts as a bonus. It got a bit unrealistic at parts but was forgivable because the action was in your face and the story was good.If you are an action fan: Worth a rental. Worth a buy!",Crank
265,Tamphex,The perfect antidote,8,7 December 2007,"The new millennium has seen the rise in mainstream cinema of a new subgenre: movies imitating video games. By that I don't mean the vile garbage released by the likes of Herr Boll; I'm referring to the kind of movies whose plots, visuals, characters and dialogue have all the characteristics of those found in a video game. The latest George Lucas flicks (most notably Revenge of the Sith), the Matrix sequels, I, Robot, Aeon Flux and especially the recent 300 are the best examples of the genre - movies that feature gigantic CGI worlds, huge battle sequences, and, sadly, silly dialogue, cardboard acting and a vapid story that nobody cares about.Crank is the first movie I've come across to openly satirize this new trend - it is a movie that explicitly aspires to be a video game, and makes no secret of it. It's as shallow, forgettable and devoid of any depth or meaning as the aforementioned movies, the crucial difference being that Crank doesn't take itself seriously - not for one second. This makes Crank infinitely more entertaining to watch. It promises no deep messages or epic storytelling, only violence, a half-naked Amy Smart, over-the-top stylistics and an adrenaline kick to the heart - and it most certainly delivers.From the very first frame, dizzying camera-work and wild heavy metal soundtrack puts the viewer into the exact same mindset as that of Statham's character, and 86 minutes later, as the comically violent roller-coaster comes to a stop, the viewer's heart is still racing. It's just that effective. Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor is a duo to watch out for in the future. Heavily influenced by MTV, Guy Ritchie movies and, naturally, video games, they have created a flick that stands out in its genre as something truly unique.As I wrote earlier - Yes, it's shallow. No, it's not anything deep. No, you won't be thinking about its plot, themes or messages for days after. But - in a decade of movies wherein actors of Ewan McGregor's calibre bounce around slaying cartoon robots and Gerard Butler prances around in underwear growling about dining in hell and keeping a perfectly straight face doing so - we need more movies like Crank.",Crank
266,videooutakes,The Dumbing Down of Film Viewers,1,17 September 2006,"This (waste of) film is so bad it's not even worth commenting on. I wasted money on this trash cause I had some hope that it might actually be worth seeing, given the fact that the beautiful and talented Amy Smart was co-starring. suffice to say I thought ""Domino"" was one of the worst movies recently made until I saw this piece of s**t. Domino is a masterpiece compared to this film.The scene in Chinatown, don't worry I won't give away the plot point here, (not that there is any plot to give away), is by far the most ridiculous scene I had ever seen.

The basic premise is wonderfully effective at ensuring a hero who can't slow down, and providing tension even when you are looking at an empty room - has he slowed down too much...? Stratham is hilarious as jacked-up killer with an imagination for violence and a lot of humour comes from eccentric problem-solving from someone who really has nothing to lose.Do not expect the sort of underworld chess that you see towards the end of Carlito's Way - This film is more of a cross between 24 and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.The slightly weaker point, for me, was the love interest, which was rather parodied along the lines you might see in a Hong Kong action film, and sometimes slowed the action down. But I can forgive it for that, as this film doesn't need to be taken seriously.Overall, a very entertaining film, which doesn't quite manage to keep up a constant stream of tension. Still, very good.",Crank
269,trevor-hall-1,Crank Raises Blood Pressure,7,7 September 2006,"At last Jason Steatham is given a role he deserves after several fine performances in, among others, Lock, Stock and Snatch. The role is perfect for Steatham who plays a hit-man wanting to reform and leave the business. As usual, the motivation for this is the love he has met. I watched this movie through a similar lens to Pulp Fiction, Snatch, and Lock Stock because this allows me to catch the black humor. As a non-American, I'm always amused to see the US audience reaction to sex and violence - and how different are the reactions that those two provoke. Both are delivered with style and wit in this movie. After a disastrous summer for good movies, it was refreshing to leave the theater with a smile. Final Note - poor final scene in which Steatham falls from a helicopter at about a thousand feet and then is seen to plummet about thirty thousand!",Crank
270,Shon R.,"Not just bad, extremely bad.",1,2 September 2006,"With the ""Transporter"" movies, Jason Statham was on the right track. Those flicks were silly, maybe not too bright, but admittedly fun. One could be forgiven for thinking ""Crank"" would be similar. ""Crank,"" however, isn't cheesy fun. In fact, There isn't a single redeeming quality in this movie. Frenetic camera work does not make a good film. Amy Smart does a terrible job acting,and most of the other actors do badly, too. Much of the humor on screen is just disgusting, and it's really not funny at all. The movie is unrealistic to a fault; In one part, Statham is shown being shot in the leg, and in another scene a minute or two later, he is walking around as if nothing ever happened, and he finishes the film without any trace of a wound. Did I mention that there isn't a ""good guy"" in this movie? From the beginning, it doesn't matter who lives or dies, because they're all terrible people anyway. Argh. Three of us, all males, saw this flick and we all hated it. Save your money.",Crank
271,pjreiter,Best action flick I have seen for quite some time,10,4 June 2007,"Ignore any reviews that the plot is unrealistic. It just doesn't matter. This movie is simply a nonstop action flick that should be simply enjoyed for what it is. From the very beginning this movie sets the stage for a two hour thrill ride that lasts until the very end. What makes this movie truly enjoyable is the witty humor that is present all throughout this movie. For example, there is one intercourse scene that is so unbelievable that it just makes you laugh out loud while in another scene a bird gets blown to bits. I had to watch the movie a couple times to catch all the offbeat humor. This use of humor is similar to the way it was used in ""Pulp Fiction."" I have to say that the addition of the woman to the movie definitely added to my enjoyment of the film. Her nonchalant attitude to everything going on around her was just too perfect. There is one brilliant scene where he brings her to his car while she is oblivious to him killing a couple assassins. So go pop a bag of popcorn and get ready for one hell of an action film.

It is extremely fast paced, both in action and story, which is very fitting considering the plot.Unlike most cookie cutter action flicks, Crank truly offers something for everyone. It is absolutely without question the funniest action flick I have ever seen. The reaction from the crowd in the theater was stronger than any Hollywood blockbuster I've been to. Quentin Tarrintino fans will especially love this movie.Chev Chelios is phenomenal, as usual, and the rest of the cast delivers a top notch performance. I truly cannot say enough good things about this film. If you are in any way a fan of either action or comedy, you need to see this movie.",Crank
273,raycja89,Jason Statham at his best!,10,19 January 2008,"There are not enough words to describe ""Crank"", one of the best action films I've seen, ever. The story revolves around a man by the name of Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), who is injected with the ""Chinese Cocktail"" and in order to survive must keep his adrenaline levels at a high, all the while trying to find the man who did it to him and keeping his girlfriend from breaking up with him. This guy's got it tough!I don't know exactly if this is the most original movie, I've not heard of another one like this. Statham gives one of his most solid performances of his career. Although it's classifiable as an Action film that doesn't exclude all the other genres involved. It has everything you could ask for in a movie, comedy, drama, action, a love story, and yes, it even includes dismemberment. May I also had it has one of the most hilarious sex scenes I've ever seen in any movie. Those who say this was just a waste of time and money, need to rethink what they've said. Look at it for what it was, a fun, uninhibited look at the life of a man out for vengeance. This movie does not disappoint, but if you're not a huge ""Shoot 'Em Up"" type of person then you might want to reconsider this title.

Racism, sexism - it's got all the workings of a stereotypical guy flick.",3,18 July 2008,"This movie takes all the clichés in the guy movie book and exploits them like you wouldn't believe. Slow motion, fast motion, camera jerking action sequences? Check. Naked women that are completely braindead and in more heat than a cocker spaniel? Check. Blatant drug use? Check. Retardedly overt use of racism and stereotypes? Check.I was actually bawling over laughing this entire movie. How it gets away with racism is just hilarious, to be honest. I'll save you the trouble of watching the movie and tell you right now what it's all about - it's Jason Statham beating the crap out of a whole bunch of black, hispanic, and Asian people. That's it. Mixed in with a little sex and crack use here and there. As people said, this movie is quite similar to playing a Grand Theft Auto game. That definitely isn't a good thing if you want your money's worth at the ticket box, because that kind of gratuity and violence doesn't work in the context of a non-interactive movie. Seriously, we go to the theater to see plot twists and character development, not to watch some guy beat up minorities for an hour and a half. This movie is just as bad as all the video game translations like Doom and Resident Evil in that respect - it's completely shallow, relying only on flash and ""adrenaline"" to keep its audience from walking out halfway through the movie.And I was also appalled by the lack of respect this movie has for women. In fact, I think the producer might have a grudge against the female sex. Women are portrayed in this movie as utter animals. The only woman that says a complete sentence in the film is Statham's character's girlfriend, and even she rips off her clothes halfway through the movie and gives Statham an unzipped delight during an action sequence, while he's shooting minorities in a moving vehicle! It's just like GTA! Not to mention Statham rapes her in public, an action to which she doesn't give a second thought, but I don't want to spoil too much of this horrible movie if you decide, unwisely, to see it.So if you want to see a movie that tries to copy gratuitous masterpieces like Pulp Fiction and instead becomes a mindless gorefest and softcore pornography piece, then go ahead, get the DVD.

277,theplatformtheatre,Not Bad But Not Average,6,12 March 2007,"Didn't mind this movie but I don't know if its worth a second viewing.Different it is, and the ending shot is a knockout.Two things let Crank down. One is the script. It is probably a draft short of being ready, but the movie's pace and craziness (and in some scenes outrageousness)keep it interesting. It is very original and different to most action films, which is both refreshing and why it works.Crank though not perfect is good enough to interest me in anything the writer and director make.Second is Jason Statham. He's getting better as an actor, but having to carry a whole movie proves he's still not good enough. Someone like Daniel Craig who looks tough enough and can definitely carry a movie would have been better. But then there are aren't many tough guy British actors to choose from for an action movie who are 1: big enough names 2: good actors 3: look good in an action movie.Also most of the action was with guns and Jason Statham didn't get to indulge in enough fisticuffs - which is where he really excels on screen.Worth a visit but not to everyone's taste",Crank

279,taford02-1,A Disappointing and Vulgar Movie,2,4 September 2010,"There is no way that I could support the themes that were portrayed in this movie. First of all, I take offense to Chev saying, fairly early in the movie, that ""it's time to kick some black ass!"" This is a racist comment (coming from him) and I do not appreciate it. I also do not appreciate any portrayal of the threat of violence in a hospital. I work in a hospital and we do not need to portray these types of scenarios on film. We do not want to give the crazies ideas. I also do not appreciate the vulgarity of portraying a sex scene in public. That is when I turned this ""piece of trash"" movie off. I had seen Jason Stratham in the ""Transporter"" brand and mistakenly thought Crank might be similar. Boy, was I wrong. This movie was a waste of time--and although I ordered the second movie--I will not be watching it. Sometimes you just have to take a stand. IMO: this is one of those times. I should have turned the movie off when he made the comment about ""kick some black ass"". I thought though--that maybe that's the worst of it and the rest will be okay. When I turned the movie off--I noticed that all of the bad guys were people of color (black, Chinese, Hispanic or Puerto Rican. So, I have to conclude that either Jason and/or his director and production team are a bunch of in-bred, racist, webbed feet bigots. And that is my take on this ""piece of trash"" film.

On the other hand, if you want a funny, quick paced, violent stomp through the big city, this is Crank. The quips are rude, crude and hysterical. The action is verging on unbelievable at times, but still satisfying. After watching, I decided that what makes this movie so enjoyable is Jason Stratham himself. He moves chomps through the scenery like a highly unstable, extremely irate animal. Think force of nature - he conveys an intensity and natural toughness that is remarkable - especially on a fella that is not the young, buff figure one would expect from an action star. I will be buying this one and enjoying it for years to come.",Crank
281,mistertopps,one of the worst films i've ever seen,1,22 September 2006,"There is a scene in this movie where the main character needs a boost of adrenaline, so in the middle of chinatown, he starts ripping off his girlfriend's clothing. She yells ""NO! NO!"" and he continues to rape her. She eventually gives in, and starts liking having sex in public, so it turns out to be okay.There is another scene where he needs a boost of adrenaline, and the lead singer of Linkin Park tells him that he should snort tons of nasal spray. That it will make him high.I'm all about films that blur the line of good and bad. I'm all about films with characters that have questionable morality. But this film completely glorifies such horrible things with no sense of irony. It's told in the dumbest of ways, with quite possibly the worst looking cinematography I've seen in a mainstream movie, and editing that's not even worthy of mtv. There are people that cut quickly and do flashy things, but here the effects remind me of something that would be on that show blind date.All of this could be forgiven if the action was good. But really all the action consists of are people running around holding guns. And every once in a while there's a loud noise, with shaky camera work and quick cutting so you never quite understanding what's happening.It's just bad film-making, with even worse writing. And Jason Statham's such a great actor-- his performances in Snatch and Lock Stock are terrific. I can't imagine why he'd say yes to such a subpar script. And none of his fighting talents are really showcased here either. I mean, he rides a computer generated car sideways up an escalator. And every once in a while punches someone. But none of the grand choreography from the Transporter movies is even on display here.The filmmakers definitely have visual ideas. But none of them are actually there to tell the story, or even help in the mood. I mean, do we need to zoom in on a pigeon's chest to then go inside and watch it's heart beating? Not only is it poorly done, and the effect terrible; forget that it doesn't move the story forward--- if it's only intent is to ""look cool"" they completely failed at that (and somewhat rips off what the more brilliant visual stylist Joseph Kahn did in his brilliant and underrated Torque).If you'd like to see a smart film that actually has an agenda and is also edgy, rent Dan Minahan's ""Series 7.""

Fast-paced action, but with a decidedly humorous twist. You'll be laughing with your mates as you watch the credits rolling.Statham is injected with a poison that requires him to keep his heart going by keeping his adrenaline levels high, and he gets himself into all sorts of trouble - all of it on purpose - to keep himself alive.The cast is rather stereotyped and clichéd, adding to the amusing ""feel"" of the movie, and the clever use of ""warping"" and other visual effects lets the audience feel how Statham must be feeling, with the poison running thru' his system. It's not realistic, it's not politically correct, but it's damned good fun.Definitely recommended, one of the few action flicks that appeal to guys and girls alike, and Statham has again brought a character to life in yet another movie that far surpasses the typical ""Hollywood"" blockbusters.

283,stuartthomasgoodall,Crank Cool,7,23 December 2015,"Good films usually contain a defining line of dialogue, or a scene which neatly encompasses the ethos of the movie in an easily- digestible chunk. Like popcorn.In 'Crank', this moment comes shortly after the main character - a hit-man called Chev Chelios - has finished conducting a meeting with a crimeboss in a swimming pool. Soaking wet, Chelios is trying to get into a taxi. But the taxi driver refuses the fare because he doesn't want his cab soiled. Chelios takes exception to this, so he drags the driver from the vehicle and throws him to the ground. For an instant, Chelios is unsure of what to do: he isn't thinking straight because he has a heart-full of fatal, adrenaline- suppressing 'Chinese Sh*t' with which he has been injected by his arch-nemesis. On top of that, he is on the run from the police and the mob. By assaulting the taxi driver he has kept his adrenaline up, but his conspicuity too. The crowd watch him with mounting suspicion, ready to alert the authorities. Chelios looks at the driver. He is of Southern Asian descent. Chelios looks back at the crowd. They are White Americans. Chelios has an idea. He points at the driver and yells 'Al-Qaeda'. Then Chelios steals the taxi and leaves.At this point the crowd begin to panic. Some flee. Others attack the stricken taxi driver. More join in. Then, an old lady grabs the driver's leg. She twists it as hard as she can, and it breaks with a crunch.This scene tickled me. I'm not entirely sure why. Perhaps it was due to Chelios's jet-black appraisal of the situation, and the means by which he applied his prejudices against American Culture to his predicament with such anti-social success. Or maybe it's because I like the idea that an old lady could break the leg of a grown man with her bare hands, purely by strength she could only muster in a fit of jingoistic rage. Either way, I was not expecting such black satire from a potentially-brainless action film, which, on the surface, is exactly what Crank appears to be: man gets injected with fatal drug by nemesis. Man can only stay alive by stimulating adrenal gland. Cue action set-pieces of steadily increasing ridicule. Simple.Using this basic central premise, Crank transcends its narrow action movie credentials to explore greater themes. It explores the psyche of a man who is forced to suffer an existential crisis. A man whose relationship with his environment is altered beyond his control. A refugee from his preferred state of being. Like most refugees, he wishes to return home. But he learns very quickly that this is impossible. He must accept that his continued survival is a luxury afforded to him only by his ability to explore and understand his own stimuli.This revelation sets Chelios upon a journey inward. By necessity he abandons fear of consequence to discover what excites him. He embraces impulse: he takes drugs; forces a medic to defibrilate him; commits robberies; listens to 'Achy Breaky Heart' and vandalises a steering wheel; and Christ-rides a police motorcycle into a restaurant to the genteel strains of Everybody's Talking' - a song about feeling detached from ordinary human interaction. It is absurd and beautiful. A bizarre, Freudian pastiche.A side-effect of the life-affirming death serum is that it gives Chelios a raging hard-on, perhaps due to his body sensing imminent expiry: the primal need to propagate the species. This urge leads Chelios to his lover, Eve. But, when he sees her, rather than consummate his passion immediately, he feels a different impulse: to tell the truth. To face the possibility that when he reveals he is not a video game programmer but a hit-man, Eve will leave him. This seems to be the only impulse in the film over which he hesitates. The only consequence of which he seems genuinely afraid. And it is strangely touching.Still, reveal this secret, he does. But Eve won't accept the truth. As they leave her apartment Chelios protects her from some hired goons of whom she is unaware. Absently she reveals that she hasn't taken her birth control pills. Once Chelios and Eve escape into busy streets, Chelios's heart weakens again. More adrenaline is needed. To get it he knows that he must follow his impulses: he must copulate with Eve immediately, in public, to generate the life- saving adrenaline he needs. But first, chivalrously, he questions her trust in him, which she reassures. Then he asks her. At first she refuses. Then, reluctantly, she complies. They make love on a bustling sidewalk. Suddenly a bus full of tourists appears. Their flashbulbs go off. Unexpectedly, Eve abandons herself to the moment. She makes a sacrifice of her dignity along with his so that Chelios might live. Eve bellows her encouragement to him. 'I'm alive' he shouts. And, he is - at the very apex of life: a creature of pure animal instinct, throwing off the shackles of ethereal social expectation to perform the hyper-real act of creation in the face of imminent death. And in the midst of all this, the public look on, impressed, almost as if they understand the gravity of the moment.Some might say that this is filth: just a flimsy excuse for a gratuitous 'love' scene. In fact, the whole film is just one big flimsy excuse for a lot of gratuitous scenes. After all, this film stars Jason Statham - a man not known for playing great existentialists. These questions were not on his mind when he read the script. He probably just chuckled to himself as he flipped the pages over, thinking about how he always wanted to play a character who deliberately burns his hand in a waffle iron.Some might say that I am reading into things - far too much. But I like reading. It gives me an adrenalin rush.",Crank

The movie is rated 18+ in Germany due to chopped off limbs and extreme violence, but this is what should be Pulp Fiction II IMHO. Although the dialogs in Pulp Fiction are much better, this movie just continues in the same way, while being chronologically. Basic story: the movie is about a man who wakes up and finds out that someone poisoned him with a strange drug which will kill him. The only way to slow down the poison is to have an adrenaline-rush, so the whole movie is a big violence-, sex- and action-trip.

It's literally a load of fast moving images relating to a vague story with hardcore metal music that was composed purely to make money from people with absolutely no attention spans. Honestly I like mildly entertaining action films but this doesn't deserve the IMDb rating at all.It is basically the same story as speed, but instead of preventing the bus slowing down to avert disaster, Jason Statham's character must prevent his heart from slowing down else he dies. This gives him the licence to go on the 83 minute rampage, pausing briefly to *liaise* with his terribly acted girlfriend.My lowest rating ever.",Crank
288,DrBootleg,Utterly inane but completely brilliant,9,4 September 2006,"How often is it that you leave the cinema having just seen a film thinking, 'That was simultaneously the worst and the best film I have ever seen'? I know there's a lot of movies that divide opinion on a national scale, but I never thought I would see a film that induced me into a state of Schizophrenia and leave me fighting an internal battle as to whether what I had just seen was completely imbecilic or genius at work. Alas, the outcome has yet to be decided.The plot of this film was fairly straightforward - Chev Chelios (Jason Statham - fantastic name for a character by the way!), a professional hit-man, has been injected with a lethal Chinese poison that sucks the adrenalin out of his system. If he doesn't stimulate his Adrenal Gland so that it compensates for this loss - HE WILL DIE! No, it's not a spoiler, this is actually the premise of a film. I've heard this concept compared with 'Speed' but with a human instead of a bus. That doesn't really do it justice. If it's going to be compared to the aforementioned film, it should really be said that this film is 'Speed' being injected with a sizable dose of Epinephrin followed by a generous session of defribulation (literally).This film does not stop moving. The plot is actually fairly decent, leading Chelios down avenues of ridiculous inconceivability, but at the same time fantastically entertaining, and at times, incredibly funny. 'That scene' in China town comes to mind.Furthermore, my state of confusion as to how to define this film is intensified by the stylistically unique direction. At first I thought it was going to be a fairly standard action film, with some not-so-interesting stylistic points, but I'm afraid not. This film is full of quirks - the subtitles for certain words and sentences, the appearances of supporting video clips in the character's surroundings, the exciting use of camera angles, the list goes on...But hold on...I did say that this film is inane, as well as brilliant. Why? It is just plain idiotic. Some of the things that happen are completely unbelievable, the characterization is fairly stereotypical, and the acting often wooden.Furthermore, the violence in this film is fairly gratuitous, but being of the de-sensitized MTV generation, this didn't really bother me. However, it does deserve its 18/R certificate, as the violence is unnecessary at times.However, all these bad points cannot detract that this film did exactly what the basis of all films should be - it entertained me. I left the cinema with a huge smile on my face, having realized that sometimes we shouldn't take life too seriously. This film is serious fun.Therefore, I am left with no choice but to give this film a near-perfect score, despite all its flaws, as I wish all films could inspire me to write a review of this nature, instead of slipping into the dregs of mediocrity. Well done Crank!",Crank
289,tomscammell,A Pile of Old Crank,1,13 February 2008,"A friend recommended that I go to watch this film. He is no longer my friend. Given the idea, this could have a great film if the writing had been approached in a remotely adult manner. I would say that this is the second worst film I have ever seen behind Rancid Aluminium. It certainly was the most purile, immature and shallow film I have ever seen. Even Disney films and kid's cartoons contain meaningful undertones, but this film is just shockingly mindless from start to finish. Throughout the film I just wanted Jason Statham's character to hurry up and die so that I didn't have to waste any more of my life watching it.I am not offended by swearing of any sort, but the constant totally unnecessary barrage of foul-mouth rubbish from most of the characters became grating and very very boring after about 15 minutes, and didn't let up all the way through the film. A lot of the ideas and little 'asides' seem to have been stolen from Pulp Fiction but used very badly and with no style.The only slightly funny part that I can recall was when someone's budgie accidentally got shot, other than that, this film ain't worth spit.",Crank
290,BaronVonCount,Incoherent trash,3,17 October 2017,"A good explosions and car chase movie replete with corny wisecracks is a bodily need for most males.It is one of our burdens. Bond movies deliver our hit very satisfactorily, as do the Bournes, Die Hards, and many Jason Statham movies, and with the dose of cinematic testosterone we can go about our daily lives, often for weeks, or even months before we need some more explosions etc. 3/10 is the lowest score I have ever given a movie and how I sat through the whole thing will always be a mystery to me. Anyone who has overdone a cocktail of substances could relate to Statham's lead character, which is the central theme of the flick, but sadly despite our enthusiasm to suspend disbelief this movie is strained beyond comprehension. Almost certainly the writers and crew were in a more heavily drugged state than Statham's character and the ensuing incoherent mess is just a nasty waste of time. And profoundly unfunny. You are better off rewatching one of the old Transporter movies.",Crank

This movie has it all: comedy, wit, action, and other stuff, but it is so great I forgot the rest. I was entertained the whole time. The acting was well done, as was the writing. The characters were fresh and believable. Jason Statham has done it again. This guy has a knack for taking some what brutal characters, and turning them into a guy that you want to hang out with. There are some awkward/ disturbing moments, I am not going to lie, but they are easily recovered from.Recap: Great movie, it has something for everyone, so that is who I recommend it to ... everyone.",Crank
292,jotcool88,"Not Jason's fault, just should of picked a different script",1,9 September 2006,"The movie concept for this film sounds good on paper, man kills for a living as a hit-man, boss gets frustrated with him for being out of control, get the cartels to inject him with a deadly virus and must keep up his heart rate to stay alive and thus looks for revenge, its probably why Jason Statham signed on to do this film. In the beginning I wasn't sure to take this film seriously or as a joke, the two time first directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor looked like they were hoped on some heavy duty drugs in the early part of the film with all the crazy camera shots than when it looked like they lighted down, they came back to what they started, it almost made me sick just watching it. Anyway Jason Statham is a good action star if directed properly obviously we all saw how good he was in Transporter 1 and 2, this wasn't the case, yes crank did have some humor in the mix, when both Jason character (Chev) and Amy smart (eve) were in town square china town and the only way he could keep the adrenaline going was having sex with his girlfriend and the part were he was distracting his girlfriend (eve) by knocking over her purse to fight the ""bad-guys"" and breaking their necks in the process. When Chev decided to go downtown to find out about getting an antidote at west coast customs appeared to look that way and all with the building suddenly being able to bounce around from a fight inside, only to get some more drugs in his system in the process. All in all I cant say anything else good about this flick than, don't waste your time or money on this film and let me save you the dreading tears from watching this film, Jason character dies falling out of a helicopter, trying to phone his girlfriend in mid-air, which he get the answering machine, he lands on top of a car and bounces off. That's all you'll get from this film is disappointment and disgust. Do yourself a favor go see ""little miss sunshine"" there's a movie that will make you think and won't leave you felling dumbfounded.If this was a parody of other action flicks I probably would of gave it a 8 out of 10 but it looked like the directors wanted the audience to take it seriously so it gets a 1 out of 10.",Crank

There is lots of running and shouting. Much of it is bordering on ridiculous, though to be honest one or two scenes did raise a smile. Beware there is a ludicrous sex scene - totally unbelievable to the point of not even been funny.

And this movie even surpasses that.Believe it or not, but as soon as the movie starts, the action begins (don't want to spoiler). And it continues to the very end. You are pumped up on adrenaline the whole time, and I really mean it.

No fun for me, folks, but certainly maddening.footnote: If the dude (Stratham) is anatomically endowed to the extent the film implies (see Japanese girl proclaim, ""He very manly, Magnum size!""), perhaps pornos would be a better outlet for him.

'Handsome Rob' from the Italian Job stars and is quite good at leading and spends a lot of time with his butt hanging out. He is very believable as an action star. Their really is a lack of something during this flick with the exception of the sex scene which is quite unbelievable. The final scene plays out just like a gang war and ends rather abruptly.

This was statham at his best, doing what he loves. Making action movies. Statham, most well known for the transporter franchise was born to make pure adrenaline pumping action movies. From the very beginning the hand held camera technique reels you into the simple yet interesting story line. But that's what is great, taking a simple story and making it into a great movie.

Where to begin....John Statham was adequate in this poorly written movie. Sadly, there was not a single fight scene worthy of mention in this movie. Martial arts are absent, so if you were hoping for some, forget it.The movie kept a good pace, but the movie took the absurd premise of the poison/adrenaline relationship to a nearly unwatchable extreme.The villains were boring stereotypes. The acting terrible all around, the character that played the girlfriend was particularly hard to watch. The character was extremely stupid, and badly acted, which sucked because so much of the plot involved her. I don't know what this actress did for a living before this film but I bet it involved a brass pole and a liquor license.Yes, there was a lot of action. Was it good action? I felt not. The camera work was more interesting to watch then the actual on screen events.At least this movie had the good sense to have a sense of humor about itself. In good conscious I cannot recommend this movie to anyone but the most staunch John Statham fans.This movie would have only rated a 2 on my vote if I had not had a few good laughs, sadly a few of those laughs I think were not intentional.",Crank

When Statham is injected with a poison that will take effect and kill him once his heart rate stops, he goes on an adrenaline rush. The movie keeps you in suspense and keeps you rooting for Statham all the way through.I've loved him since 1998 when he was in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, when Statham had a major role as Bacon. Then to follow that movie up, he did Transporter (which I believe is his best acting performance), then he came out with Crank.Although I believe Crank is nowhere good compared to Transpoter 1, and Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels, I still believe it deserves to be on IMDb with a rating of 7.5 or higher.This movie also has a great two person leading cast with Amy Smart and Jason Statham. It is still young in both their carriers, so I am excited to see what they can bring to the movie business.Although the only movie that I believe should be on IMDb top 250 is Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (which should be high 190's or low 200's), I feel that Statham should be in one of the top 50 actors of his time.

305,Wallpaper1,Crank has great action and unrealized acting/plot potential.,4,4 October 2006,"I was really excited to see this film. After reading a review that gave a brief plot synopsis I was hooked. I actually drove for two hours and visited six different theaters looking for this film. The thing I found compelling was the meta-genre potential a piece like this had, with Pulp Fiction specifically in mind. By taking the absurdity of action films to its most extreme, it seemed that the makers of the film were fully free to explore. Unfortunately, what I got was a rehashed action comedy based on the Rockstar video game lines. That's all it was. I'm not joking here. If you took the plots and characterizations from Grand Theft Auto 3 and True Crime, spiced them up a bit and gave them human counter parts, you'd get Crank. I'm not sure why no one bothered to mention this in any single review I've read so far.Now, having said that, I'd also like to say that this film delivers on the thrills. The weak script didn't completely kill some very funny scenes, and Jason Statham? does a really competent job.",Crank

Besides these funny situations action is also there in this movie that you expect from a Jason Statham movie. Talking about this movie the thing that I liked most that this movie doesn't waste any time and comes straight to the point and we know what this is all about. In first two minutes we come to know that this guy has been injected with a poison that will kill him if his heart rate drops. Then starts his journey how he keeps himself alive and at the same time he seeks vengeance on the person who has put him in this situation. I also liked this movie because was the fact that this movie was different. It's not something that you see all the time in traditional  a unique story. It was a great effort by Jason Statham. I really liked his acting coming out of his transporter movies (though I liked them also). Scenes were also pretty good written and we do not get a chance to get bored. It is fast paced movie that will keep you on the edge of your seats. Nice story, brilliant acting, great sound score, funny situations all contribute in making crank a worth movie. I supposed they could have end the movie in some another way.

Its that ""I'm gonna kill you, motherf***er"" and ""You're a dead man, a**hole"" type dialogue we've heard so often before.

Amy Smart's big scene was in the public sex category and I don't know how she felt doing the scene, but I cringed. A pretty girl, decent actress, and THIS is the best the script could do for her? Please someone tell me the original script had her as an actual person as opposed to a receptacle and it got changed mid-shoot. Not satisfied with dragging her all over town in his efforts to keep the adrenaline flowing, he stops in the middle of Chinatown, in front of men, women, and children and insists on the humiliation and degradation of public sex. Worse still -- and who would have thought that possible -- she eventually gets into it! (YEECH!!) I guess getting shot at, beating up thugs, and watching your friends die just wasn't doing the trick. The other women in the movie were, I kid you not, kept in glass bowls or walking around pools semi-nude. Even the woman at the doctor's house looked like a hooker. What are these people thinking?

This movie felt like it was not just about a guy who was poisoned, but rather that everyone was suffering from some kind of drug induced disconnect. Also the sexual aspect was done in such an unintelligent and distasteful way, that while someone might argue that it was due to the underworld nature of the characters, I found that it detracted from the films quality and cohesion of atmosphere.

Thanks to the availability of unlimited ammunition and some culturally iconic soft drinks he accomplishes his task. The ancillary characters especially THE ditsy but sweet, blond girlfriend and THE semi-burned out and on his way back from LasVegas medical doctor keep us interested our hero's plight while providing some comic relief.

The premise is pretty genius for a stupid action movie, and it gives a great excuse for all the crazy stuff to happen. This is just as much a comedy as it is action, some of the side characters are just ridiculous and hilarious and some of the scenarios Chev gets himself are equally funny, whether intentional or not. I am honestly not sure whether this movie is self-aware or not, but I wholeheartedly enjoy it either way.",Crank

Fast pace and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The comedic relief is outrageous more laughs were coming out of the theater than gasps. Crazy framework and scene structuring.Crank is a film that knows the majority will see mediocer, but shoves it in their faces with a chaotic and blood pumping thrill rideSthatmen does a great job as a hit-man, and there are plenty of kool CQC flashes that he uses to take down many thugs. With some of the delusions and camera work you feel like you've been shot up with a hallucinogenic. Some scenes will leave you wide eyed and open mouth and others will make your sides split with clever comedy. Overall if you want a weekend thrill ride then CRANK it up",Crank

323,ShmuelReuven,"Speed on foot! Jason Statham is all about the action! Great stunts, fast paced, and a sex scene with Amy Smart!",8,1 September 2006,"British actor Jason Statham is best known for his roles in both Transporter films, The Italian Job, and of course Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.In Crank, he's raised his status as an action star big time! The premise of the film is Chev Chelios (Jason) is a hit man/mobster; after messing with the wrong group, they drug him and inject a poisonous substance where he only has a few hours to live.In order to prolong his imminent death, he must keep his heart rate up, and adrenaline pumping. Achieving that goal takes driving around the city streets of Los Angeles at crazy amounts of speed, standing on top of a moving motorcycle, getting electrically shocked at a hospital, getting into a fight at a strip club with eight gunmen, and running around LA in nothing but a hospital gown  yes, you get to see his rear.And all that action really takes place in the first 30 minutes; the major stunts happen later in the movie, including an open-air sex scene in the middle of Chinatown with his girlfriend, Eve (Amy Smart). I won't tell you too much about that scene, but let's just say it was hilarious and sexy all at the same time. Even the tourists who got to watch the action were laughing! Crank is written and directed by commercial directors Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine; they also shot a lot of the footage themselves on hand-held cameras. Believe me, it works; from the beginning scene, you're in the eyes of Chev, literally. That first scene takes place in Chev's apartment, after receiving the injection; we follow him as he gets out of bed and stumbles to the TV to watch a taped message from his assailants, headed by Ricky Verona (Juan Pablo Cantillo).Realizing what he must do, he picks up this amazing 60-some inch flat screen TV and throws it at the wall, destroying it. I have to say, watching that TV get destroyed killed me inside. But there's great camera focus while all the craziness is happening around him.Throughout the movie, there's great music  and that also starts with the opening credits; a real 1980's feel, with hip 80's music, and Atari-like graphics. Along with the theme of the movie, while Chev is in a taxi, the Billy Ray Cyrus song, 'Achy Breaky Heart' comes on the radio  classic placement! Crank also stars Efren Ramirez (Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite) as Chev's 'partner in crime.' Fortunately for Chev, he doesn't have to rely on him too much for the action; Efren plays Kaylo, a gay drag queen. Efren is only in the film for a little bit, but does provide for some good humor, and that definitely goes for his clothing, mannerisms, and his dancing.As we follow Chev on his hunt for Verona, Mark and Brian used the internet program Google Maps for location purposes. It's the first time I've ever seen the use of that sort of thing actual locations were used and shown in a movie.Along his chase, and running out of adrenaline, Eve (Smart) joins back up with Chev; she gives him enough energy to make it just a few more hours  the only way she knows how.I'm always incredibly impressed with the amount of stunts Jason does, and at his ability to pull them off. Crank is no exception! The film is intense as all hell! Crank is one of your best bets for ending the summer! It's in theaters now, rated R.",Crank

326,dbrown-13,Celluliod offal for the puerile masses,2,13 March 2007,"This is the first time I've left a comment on IMDb, I'm usually content just to read other people's opinions, but after watching this sad excuse for a movie I couldn't hold myself back! If you want a movie you can discuss inanely with your mates down the pub after 8 pints then this has all the key ingredients; a lead character with a stupid name (Chev Chelios - say no more), men driving cars fast, men engaging in copious amounts of gratuitous violence, lots of shouting and swearing, and of course some nudity and sex scenes to boot (more on these later!). What this movie doesn't have is an engaging or mildly believable plot, convincing acting, coherent editing or characters you vaguely care about. I'm not gonna go into the plot too much because frankly I can't find the enthusiasm, something about a bad boy hit-man who is poisoned with a synthetic compound, thus causing his metabolic rate to fall so low he will die unless he can maintain high adrenaline levels long enough for him to get revenge. Could have been good but sadly not!In an effort to convey the protagonist's frantic efforts to stay on top of the situation the director resorts to tactics such as super fast edits, the shaky 'hand-held' camera style, both are not executed well! Unlike films such as 'Requiem for a Dream' where techniques such as these were highly effective in creating an atmosphere and tempo that really compliment the story and the characters. Here they succeed only in giving the film no cohesion, so by the end you can't help but feel you have just watched a string of repetitive action sequences with no ultimate point. This isn't helped by the poor characterisation and terribly hammy acting. JS isn't convincing at all as someone on the brink of death, in fact the only notable things about this one-dimensional character are the similarities with the stereotypical 80's action hero, namely the homoeroticism thrown in for good measure (riding around LA on a motorcycle in a hospital gown with a hard on) and the ability to bravely make jokes in the face of adversity. I don't want to be misleading here - just for the record I am largely a big fan of the 80's action flick and this is in no way representative of those, the major difference being they were good and this isn't! Lastly a quick mention about the sex scene - this has to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in a film. It goes man tries to have sex with girlfriend in crowded public market, girlfriend understandably rejects advances, man persists, girlfriend suddenly changes her mind and they begin to have sex whilst being cheered on by a crowd of bystanders, meanwhile man exclaims loudly ""I am alive, I am alive!""????? I mean I know this film is clearly not to be taken seriously but what kind of messages is that sending out; that she'll come around in the end, or that generally crowds of people will solicit this behaviour and find it entertaining! In summary : if you feel like wasting your life for a couple of hours you could go outside and sit and count the cars go by, or you could just watch Crank!",Crank
327,zoemorn,Crank only achieved with its soundtrack,2,16 January 2007,"After suffering this film I felt like I needed a shower, no, make that a delousing. Mundane and useless garbage (gratuitous language,sex,drugs,violence) abounds in a futile attempt to create edge or shock value.Much like trying to douse a crappy cut of meat with a bunch of sauce, but sadly for Statham, your still eating a crappy cut of meat. The sauce itself is garbage though, so you have a big heaping pile of garbage (sauce) on a big heaping pile of garbage (the dialog,acting,plot). The end product was supposed to have been this edgy, fast action movie boiling over with intense excitement. But they should have thrown in a 6pack of your favorite energy drink with the movie rental because it was anything but. The movie DID have a few moments that were entertaining (thus the 2 rating and not the 1 I meant to give), but they were like a few sprinkles of tasty seasoning amidst the nasty sauce and steak. The only goal that the movie seemed to achieve was to manufacture a movie that is hopefully crude and obscene to most, and the obscenity didn't add enough to the plot line, in other words I didn't feel that it was necessary for the overall story.Statham needs to do more Transporter type of films. His character never really gains your respect or concern throughout the film as he seems just as vile as his enemies with no redeeming attributes. Amy needs to get ""smart"" (sorry) and work on her skills like in The Butterfly Effect and hopefully Peaceful Warrior.",Crank
328,Delamont91,"What should've been crank, turns out to be crap",3,3 November 2011,"'Crank' (Neveldine, 2006) is a hyperkinetic action movie I should've avoided. The trailer looked sufficient though, and the average rating on IMDb actually pulled me in. To put it straightforward: 'Crank' is a movie where you won't get any hold at all of the story, because basically, it doesn't have one. In this GTA-like and abundantly violent film, Jason Statham (who is usually quite a good actor, see for example 'Snatch' (Ritchie, 2000) or 'The Mechanic' (West, 2011)) plays Chev Chelios, a ruthless assassin who doesn't seem capable of pronouncing more than five words without swearing (with my sincere compliments for this to the highly intelligent script writers) and certainly does seem capable of pulling a malfunctioning see-how-I'm-the- tough-guy facial expression. The underlying idea is honestly quite interesting, and what's more important, imaginable: 'The Beijing cocktail' is a poison that slowly causes one to die, only epinephrine (which is not, by the way, 'artificial adrenaline' as stated by Chelios, but simply the often-used Greek name of the same hormone) keeps the heart rate at a tolerable level. When an unconscious Chelios gets drugged with this dangerous liquid, he must literally run for his life. Challenging enough for any filmmaker, I'd say. So far, so good. However, what goes on for the next one and a half hours might easily account for the worst mainstream action film I've seen. The acting part is not much more than hysterical shouting and grunting (the exception to the rule is the restaurant scene with Chelios' girlfriend, which is unfortunately broken by yet another fast-paced flashback), the editing part makes it even worse to watch: over-saturated colours with the camera angles chosen precisely so, that you always wonder for longer than two seconds what you're actually looking at and maps with on screen fonts so incredibly ugly, that even Comic Sans would have been a better choice. Never become any of the scenes unpredictable, not one twist event happens and not one time I was in awe of anything in the film. The dialogues (or, perhaps should I state f*-logues) are staccato and without wit, and Amy Smart, who plays Chelios' naive girlfriend, is portrayed rather dumb than sexy (okay, maybe she's both, but the latter is obviously where her true potential lies). And eventually, guess what, the bad guys all die! Except for Chelios (whose acting makes him the true bad guy), who - amazingly! miraculously! stunningly! - survives a half mile free fall from a helicopter after bouncing off a car. An instant liquidation of his body had been more accurate (but hey, accuracy doesn't seem to be an entry in Neveldine's dictionary anyway) and had also satisfied me just that tiny little bit more. Also, this ridiculous ending opens the way for a sequel, of which the foresight alone horrifies me enough to leave me in a cranky state.I'm rating it three stars: one for the idea behind all the fuzz, one for Statham's always enjoyable accent (even when all he 'says' lacks volume restrains and self-control) and one for that one funny scene in which a lost bullet kills a random woman's house bird.3*/10",Crank

It has the special effects and the action, so people still watch it, but it doesn't quite have what it takes to be a huge hit.I enjoyed the movie, because it poked fun at itself with comic relief. I think that whoever made this movie knew it was going to be, without beating around the bush, a dumb movie. There were some Pulp Fiction-esquire moments of humor, but all-in-all this movie was nonstop action until the credits rolled.I gave it a 6 because, though it wasn't very good as a theatrical piece, but it was a fun movie, one of those movies you might see because you want an excuse to eat popcorn.",Crank

Any way you slice it, this film feels like it was an ill thought out attempt to turn a genuinely interesting idea into a film to rival others of the same type (the Transporter films, among others).

I say I really liked it because it is full of action, hilarious parts and the movie doesn't stop a second. I mean, you have to run with the film because it goes fast! In addition, it is a different action film with a different ending (unpredictable one) On the other hand, I say that maybe it was a waste of time because there were some unnecessary scenes...unnecessary!

The action is intense beyond description, though there are a few scenes that are so cliché they kind of hurt - car through mall, hanging from chopper, etc. The characters are interesting, and the performances are solid. Jason Statham, particularly, delivers a very decent performance from his limited material. I found myself really anxious to progress the plot as quickly as possible, which is impressive. The immersion factor occasionally gets pretty high.The bad, though, is pretty bad. The plot is impenetrable and laughably invalid in medical terms. The characters are INCREDIBLY one-dimensional. The acting is occasionally atrocious. Many of the action scenes are cut in such a way that it's difficult to really discern the structure of the action - who is where and etc. Worst of all, there are some moments where the movie ""tries too hard"" and ends up just seeming desperate for attention.Maybe this is a stylistic element that I don't ""get"", but sometimes images would appear on the screen with a ""Copyright..."" tag on them.

335,tomhart_53,Statham turned up to eleven.,8,8 June 2017,"Crank is a very rare breed of film that takes the conventions of a traditional movie and throws them out of a moving car. It's story is basic and to the point, but my belief is that heavily action oriented films should allow their watchers to switch off their brains and just glide through every awesome detail of it. The cinematography in Crank is excellent, from camera angles that I've found potentially too gimmicky for other films, they are used to precision here. The film delights in fast cutting, hard hitting stunts and scenes that are very anti establishment. Crank gets you geared up with a thumping soundtrack and scenes of wincing brutality, the likes of which I have rarely seen on screen. Time should also be taken to review Jason Statham's performance in the film. You feel like you are really getting inside the mindset of a vengeful, unhinged, hard-man/maniac and I personally love every second of it. There are also some great comedy moments, especially featuring Amy Smart's character trying to bring things back down to earth, often with unusual consequences.You shouldn't think about any of the small print while watching the film. If you're questioning the realism or fundamentals of Crank at any time, without letting them wash over you with a smirk, you are not the target demographic.

Once you watch it, you want to go running and dance to death metal.the reason why I penalized the movie of one point is because the movie doesn't take itself seriously and that makes me uncomfortable giving it a 10/10.It isn't a fantastic movie but it is a fun roller coaster ride.",Crank

338,hollandmctyeire,An Adrenaline Pumping Ride,9,29 August 2018,"Crank is not the type of film that is going to win any awards. While it excels in many aspects, its primary function is to thrill the viewer. And the film delivers thrills by the minute. At the same time, Crank is almost an absurdist comedy that revels in its depravity. Crank is the story of a hitman who has been poisoned with a deadly toxin that will kill him in hours. Once he becomes aware of his predicament, he realizes that the only way to stave off his death is to keep his heart rate up. The premise is incredibly entertaining and leads to a variety of ridiculous situations. Our protagonist spends the entire film beating up thugs or fornicating in front of onlookers, all to keep his blood flowing. Jason Statham puts on an admirable performance as hitman Chev Chelios. Jason Statham does not play a martial arts expert in the film and relies more on his comedic timing to deliver a character that is a complete dick but very fun to watch.The direction of the film is very unique and resembles a home movie or a found-footage movie. There are few jump cuts and little shaky cam, and this all adds up to an experience that is very exciting to watch. The film deftly balances action and comedy, as one scene may have a brutal fight scene only to be followed by some dark humor courtesy of Statham.If you're looking for an entertaining action film that doesn't require much thought, and has a premise that is definitely unique, then Crank is one to watch.

Not to forget Jason & Amy's scenes together, which absolutely blow up the screen !This work makes Quentin Tarantino a shy, silent and boring director. Jason Statham is more macho than ever, leaves zero doubts about his role as a cold-hearted hit-man focused on saving his own life while at the same time ""serving justice"" in the good old fashioned Dirty Harry way, yet WAY cooler.

However, Crank does have a relatively imaginative plot to support the graphic violence, destruction of property and open sex. Our 'hero', a recently reformed hit-man, is injected with a far-out drug that will kill him if he doesn't keep his adrenalin flowing. To accomplish this, he embarks on a fast paced, action filled cross-town rampage to secure an antidote. Although there are some interesting complexities and the hero is well acted, in the end, the movie provides us with the usual 'lack of respect for anything' and seems to support the general theme 'if it is good for me, I don't care how it impacts anyone else.' Quite honestly, I am becoming bored with movies that tend to rely mainly on the 'shock value' of the action.

It could probably  be resumed in half a page though :)  I would say that it is one of the most balanced humor/action movie i've  seen in the past years.",Crank
347,josegrappa,Nothing less than Great.,10,30 August 2006,"Crank was... Great. It's was what you hope it might be: Cool, fast, and Jason Statham kicking butt (and Rated R - It's great to hear Statham be able to go off). It was also much funnier than I expected, and once I figured out the tone I was in for the ride. I should've figured out the tone when the movie started with an 80's classic song from Quiet Riot. Or when the director and writer spoke before the movie and thanked ""Jesus"" and then said something like, ""Hold onto your seats, it's going to be f-ckin great."" This movie will probably be considered a cult classic soon. But it could be a huge box office success too. So, here's my story: I was invited to the Cast screening. My friend worked on the crew of Crank, and I got a call Monday morning to go (after another friend had to cancel - I'm always last to get the call, but glad I did TD - So don't worry). I loved Snatch, and I was probably more excited to see Jason Statham in the flesh, than to see the movie. Well, I was simply surprised. Jason was phenomenal. The movie was weird, really good weird. The action never stopped, and right when you were cringing from a needle, or something gruesome, you would be hit with something hilarious. It's was a great blend of action and humor. The writer obviously wrote this tongue in cheek. It was like he was making fun of other films. At least I think so. The movie was subtitled in a couple of random places and I found myself keeled over laughing when the Cab Driver was subtitled. The action really stood out. It was very violent, and at times very real. The bad guy, Verone, also stood out. And I think Amy Smart did a good job playing naive. The movie starts with a bang, and I was surprised that the bang held up to the final scene in the movie, which I think was simply great. My heart is still racing a bit, two days later. Yes, it's that's good.",Crank
348,edwardlindell,Explosive and hilarious action thriller in its own genre,9,30 July 2021,"Crank is one of those unique movie experiences you witness rarely. It's packed full with action from the beginning to the end and a lot of the sequences are both thrilling and laughable. The soundtrack for the movie is badass and does really fit into the mood.Jason Statham does the role perfectly and the other main characters are great too. This movie isn't perfect in any way, but that is the actual point. Those silly effects and poor CGI really adds something to the movie. With that being said, Crank is definitely a true masterpiece and a must-see for action lovers.",Crank
349,Poturak,Hell Yeah,10,23 September 2006,"What a freaky great movie.It's really like grand theft auto on a screen. I'm so glad I watched it in the theater.I love this movie.I can't remember that I watched a movie so fulled withe action, humor, coolness and ADRENALIN!!!I think it's one of the best action movies ever made. I haven't seen nothing negative on this movie. First Jason Statham was so cool!!!What he tried to get more adrenalin was imaginative. Amy Smart was sexy as hell and really funny. The Bad guys were perfect made for this film. I would say that every character was well casted for Crank.And just the idea of this movie is fantastic.How can anybody get something like that in mind. So run to the cinema and watch it!!!I have just one question about the movie!Can anybody explain me the word ""Crank""?",Crank
350,samjbrowne,Stock Standard Mindless Action Movie,5,10 October 2006,"I went along to the media screening of this movie last night.First impressions from the opening credits are that the movie is something to do with video games. It turns out that they are not so much part of the plot as the inspiration for the movie. Specifically, Grand Theft Auto has been a major influence on the director. This was unexpected and trying to spot the references was quite amusing. Some references include the way vehicles are used, costumes, characters (almost all of them are pretty much directly taken from the games), scenery, weapons and more.Product placement is rammed into your eyeballs at all times throughout the movie. Probably the weirdest one is Google Maps, which is used to show travel distances between locations. When the movie uses this technology, they actually have to show ""copyright 2006"" and the Google Maps logo on the screen. Red Bull also features heavily, as does Rock Star energy drink.The plot is utterly ridiculous from the outset and pretty much an excuse for lots of crazy stuff to happen. Basically, the main character has been injected with a heart stopping drug (""the Chinese s***"") and has to keep his adrenalin up to keep from dying. So there's fighting, drug use, gory comic style violence, chase scenes, sex, masochism and more.The dialogue is awful throughout and is so macho you don't know whether to laugh or cry. Characters do lots of stupid macho things - in the first scene, the main character kicks in his own huge plasma screen in a rage. As is so often the case in these movies, gratuitous T and A is used, presumably for the benefit of the target demographic.All of this aside, the movie is not very long and does do a good job of keeping up the pace throughout. It's utterly mindless but if you're a teenage boy, you'll probably love it.",Crank

You'll hate this film with a passion.Crank = MTV + Grand Theft Auto + Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. However, it is not, by any stretch of the imagination, the sum of its parts (Lock Stock' in itself is far Superior to Crank).Despite my comments so far, this isn't a bad film. That said, if it doesn't sound like your ""cup of tea"", it defiantly isn't.There is plenty of fun to be had here for the rest of us.The film moves on at a cracking pace. The direction, production and cast are flawless. There are plenty of mind blowing action scenes and laugh out loud moments.I enjoyed my time watching this film but it's not something I'd watch again.

The writers were not lazy on this one only efficient: no cheesy retarded stunts (you know...the Dukes of Hazard type stuff or implausible fights) or cheap plot points; they got right to the point to delivered the action.If you like wrestling or fighting this movie is a hands down must see.

The soundtrack was a great fit, the camera work highlighted the panic in Statham, and the comedy lines proved the directors were taking this movie in a light hearted fun way The only down side to the movie was the CGI work in parts which could have been done for a minimal increase in funding and would of looked a lot better One of the greatest movies of all time....No...cult classic YES",Crank

It was my third choice (The Illusionist and Wicker Man were both sold out), but it started soon and despite having heard very little about the film beforehand, I tend to like Jason Statham... So I bought the ticket, and BAM! The surprise of the summer... The action was tight, and just silly enough to make you suspend belief. There were laughs all over the place, adrenaline inducing editing, even a bus full of Japanese school girls... Believe it or not, there were FIVE separate parts where the entire audience broke out into loud applause... It was insane... I walked out of the theater completely satisfied, and vowing to see it again. Which I did, yesterday. Same theater, completely different crowd (a 6PM show on a Monday versus an 11PM show on a Saturday), same result. Cheering, high-fiving between strangers, absolutely unreal. Waiting for my wife to get out of the bathroom afterwards (she, queen of the chick flick, loved it as well), I heard at least 6 different people calling their friends to rave about the movie. Don't believe any of the bad reviews, or people who have yet to see the film commenting on it. Two separate showings, two wildly different theaters full of people (according to the visual inspection I conducted), not a single unsatisfied face from what I could tell. Sure it's a little stupid and silly at times, but it's entertaining the whole way through, just as a summer movie should be.",Crank

It had everything an action movie should have: A powerful ""hero"" with whom you can identify (or at least sympathize), a beautiful female co-star, hate-able enemies, twisting plot, and perfectly timed comedy relief. If you watch this movie in the theatre, do NOT eat/drink while you do so, because if you look away for a second, the perfect pacing of the movie will be thrown off and you'll miss part of the great experience.If you watch it at home, don't you DARE press the pause! If you know anything about movies, you'll also be able to appreciate many of the finer nuances of the cinematography, and subtle hints in the film which may suggest the ending may not be exactly as it seems.I have seen this movie while intoxicated and while sober, and both times it was just as good. I actually FELT my adrenaline pumping and slowing with the main character's, which is something a movie has never done to me before. When it's out on video, I will DEFINITELY buy it, and I hope you do, too!",Crank
358,lebovskis,What in the name of s*** was that?!..,1,10 October 2010,"Wow!! I've can't believe how retarded this movie was! OK, so the main guy has to get adrenaline pumping and to do some crazy s***, but it is f****** unexplainable! (registered in IMDb just to write how much of a piece of s*** this movie is) In this review I basically ""spoil"" and tell you about all the ""plot"" but believe me - you do not want to watch this movie if you have at least drop of brain in your head, because after this you might lose that one drop remaining.First of all, a guy goes in a cab and for no f****** reason taxi driver gives him some very rare drugs that should keep ""him going"", after he takes those drugs eh doesn't swallow them right away as if his life depends on it, but watches at a freaking bottle staring like a retard.Another thing, he goes to a hospital to get some s*** from e letter which is synthetic adrenaline and should keep him alive, instead of screaming ""Hey, I'm in hospital, I got some lethal drugs in me, could anyone help?!?!"" Next, he starts banging his girlfriend in front of hundreds of people, she doesn't even resist but instead starts shouting from pleasure, even worse, while in ""action"" he picks up his phone and talks with another guy while doing the thing!!! (Prototype of this review was 50% written in caps lock by the way) Then he goes to a warehouse to meet some guys and kill the dude who got him injected, these guys not just don't point guns at him but starts talking with the dude, no matter that they wanted him freaking dead!!! Even worse, for no reason, his girlfriend goes up the elevator in china town warfare type of neighborhood no matter she had no idea where her boyfriend was! After they get out of the warehouse an intense chase scene becomes into play, it was not just a chase scene like everywhere else, OH NO!!! it was completely different - the guy was driving/shooting and having a f****** blow*** at the moment!!!! are you kidding me!?!?!? But no!!! The greatest retardation is left for the ending. So, two guys (main one and the one that injected him) goes on a helicopter ride while brawling, after about thirty seconds they both get out, and guess what? In those 30 seconds helicopter went from about 40 meter to 20 kilometers of height and these guys both fall down as if this is a parachute flight, of course, the main dude snaps the neck of the another guy while falling, and guess what? He picks up his phone, he is falling down (still about 17 km left to the earth I guess) and he says to his girlfriend ""blah blah blah I love you I am going to die"" and then the most stupid-impossible to realize-tremendously retarded-epic scene I saw in any movie: he falls on the car, bounces back up about 30 meters like a ball, drops down on the ground... And lives!!! F****** lives!!!!!! Can you believe that?!?!?!?! This movie hold rating of 7.1 at the moment, it has no depth, no sense and is nearly as bad as the epic movie/date movie etc. Wow can you people be so ignorant?!? I thought if this is 7.1 rating this is a really good movie!! There are a lot of thousand times better movies that hold 4 or 5 stars!!! I can't believe counted on IMDb on this one!! This piece of s*** wasted 90 minutes of my life!! The director is son of a Michael Bay, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and was having LSD while directing this movie!!! Oh my god!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I knew it must be at least satisfactory as the legend Jason Statham is taking lead role. A very entertaining film overall with plenty of amusing and surprising scenes (such as the Chinatown sex scene for example). Also nice to see Statham acting alone in lead role so he isn't in the shadow of another lead actor. On the downside, I was slightly disappointed with the lack of Statham's self-designed moves from his martial art background but still his attitude with gun's and knives brings plenty of blood and slight gore. All other acting is great and a good choice of girlfriend for Chev, Amy Smart. Well deserved rating of 9/10 and definitely worth a watch!",Crank
360,punkxrock,"Oh man, so deliciously bad!",6,31 August 2006,"I don't know how else to describe this, besides ""deliciously bad"". When I saw the preview I said ""That is the perfect premise for an action flick"", and it is. It's 80+ minutes of pretty much non-stop action, with it just ramping up to be more and more ridiculous. It's pretty much Grand Theft Auto 3, on the big screen, which is sure to have plenty of people up in arms, but I was amused.My biggest gripe was with the amateur-looking on-screen maps and text. When I think about it, I guess it's the best or at least easiest way to keep everything moving, but it looked like something made on a home computer.It's hyperviolent, so be warned. It wasn't ever too serious though, and everyone is expendable, so I can't say I really cared.Would I recommend this? It's a popcorn flick - see it with your friends, to laugh, cringe, and...do whatever you do when you see a good fight or action sequence, together. It's definitely not a date movie - believe me when I tell you that if you try to play the love story angle, things will play out poorly. But if you want a ridiculous 80 minutes of fun, go for it.",Crank

It is good to see a movie live up to its 18 certificate, well deserved....oh and did i mention also in the blender is some fine woman with not so much clothes on....sweet A lot of movies that have come out lately have been mild and way over rated, Crank sits up there with plenty of everything that will please almost every viewer, damn we even brought my mother in law and she was laughing her arse off.

I wanted to see the film mainly because I enjoyed Jason Stathem's work in The Transporter (so I can enjoy a good, brainless action film). But this film starts with a mildly interesting premise and then does nothing with it. The editing is choppy just for the sake of choppiness, we have no reason to root for the main character, who's pretty much a jerk, the plot makes little if any sense, and even the action sequences are mundane and uninteresting. Poor directing, lame script, one-dimensional characters no one could possibly enjoy spending time with, and an overall concept that nothing interesting in done with. Judging from the vote tally I'm in the minority, but I will maintain that Crank is not even a good B action film.",Crank

Again this movie is a MUST SEE and again to all you die hard action fans DO NOT bring your wifey, girlfriend, son, daughters or anybody else that cannot handle spinning on TV screens or movie screens because this movie uses the spinning thing A lot since he is poisoned, oh and make sure you also do not bring anyone who can't stand nudity, sexual content, extreme violence and blood and gore.

What this movie couldn't make up in direction, a unique plot, charismatic dialog, and believable screenplay, it tried to make up with music so painfully loud and random, it was probably dangerous to ones ears. It would perhaps be not so bad had it not been for all the blood, gore and smashing of objects that didn't truly add to the action.This film was not like true lies, speed, or raid on entebbe in terms of ""action"" Next, there are scenes and events that are completely irrelevant to the plot and add little to the outcome or your understanding of the narration of the story. Without revealing any details of the scenes or events this is all I could say.Further, the shots and movements speed up or slow down almost randomly as in an attempt to do the ""matrix"" effect, and the jokes (or any of the sex in the film) are nothing more than cliché.Though a viewer may be disappointed by this review, if you enjoyed other cliché films like the one, the punisher or the bulletproof monk, you may feel right at home.Finally, due credit must be given to Jason Statham whose display of machismo so isolated from the love of his girlfriend blows some life into the actual story.",Crank

It was fun see Statham just throw his tough guy image out the window as he runs around LA in a hospital gown with no closure in the back. The action scenes were unique (Statham riding standing on a motorcycle with his arms outstretched was reminiscent of Meg Ryan in City of Angels)and the 'reaction' he has from the Epi shot was too funny (call him Omar the tent maker) Top notch action and fight scenes, but the humor dominated the movie, and kept it from being Transporter 3.

I thought that they could have gone a different way for the ending, but it was still a unique idea.One of the main reasons for my approval, was the fact that this movie was different. It's not something that you see all the time in traditional ""I have to claim revenge for what the bad guys did to me"" type of film. I really liked the action sequences, I thought that this movie was choreographed really well. I didn't find any glaring weaknesses in the film, but the overall storyline was a little lacking. Jason Statham is an amazing actor (not just in this film specifically). He can do much more that play the action hero like in the Transporter movies, and this one as well. I really liked his performance in SNATCH. I thought that his character in SNATCH was really made for him, and that nobody else could have pulled it off. I'd like to see him in movies like that more often.One more thing that I'd like to add, is that the new ""Hitman Codname:47"" movie that's coming out would have been a really good role for Statham instead of Vin Diesel.

There is more blood and more gore. That's it. I have enjoyed other Jason Statham movies such as the The Transporter and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. He has the temperament and the style to be an iconic action hero. Unfortunately, there isn't enough opportunity in this movie to really showcase his abilities. It's a mishmash of scenes and bad lines that left me feeling queasy and bored all at the same time.For anyone that likes the Quentin Tarantino style of movie with unlikely scene after unlikely scene piled on top of each other, Crank would probably be a good movie to see.",Crank
369,nxxos,Very Refreshing,10,22 April 2007,"Seems like ""Crank"" is one of the movies that is polarizing the community. Personally, I find ""Crank"" one of the best action movies ever. I've watched it several times already (in English and German) and just can't get enough of the fast-paced adrenalin rampage.Of course, you will be disappointed if you compare it to a monumental movie like ""300"" but ""Crank"" isn't an epic or drama. It's just action for action's sake, and it presents the action in a very refreshing way compared to the standard babes-bullets-bombs flicks. Fast cuts, daredevil perspectives and the myriad of audio-visual gimmicks like the word ""cunt"" on the forehead, the inverted subtitles when the perspective changes, the word ""epi*ne*phrine man"" and so on are funny elements which show that the movie is not to be taken too seriously. In fact, it's more like a comic. And you would never compare a comic to belles-lettres.I don't care if there are any plot holes (it's funny that nobody actually describes where they find one). When I come home from university I need a movie that entertains me and does not force me to think too much, and ""Crank"" just fits my criteria perfectly. If you stop analyzing it for a while and just ride with it then this movie is a pearl for action lovers.",Crank

All in all, this was a surprisingly well thought out action movie--I highly recommend it for anyone who feels that being a viewer has become boring. You'll laugh, you'll scream; you'll even feel empathy for Chev! This may not rank as one of the best films of the year, but it certainly will be one of the most entertaining!

Well let me just say if you go into this movie expecting another transporter movie with a much worse storyline...think again. The story keeps you watching, the action keeps you glued and the humor spread throughout lightened it up enough to get ready for the next big action scenes...with all the good scenes, camera work, acting there are some parts in the movie that did quite get the message I think they were shooting for especially in the car scene with Amy Smart...the end of that scene kind left us scratching our heads but it was back to the intense story and so it was forgot. Or another when he takes the drugs in the cab and it shows him looking at the kid back and for that made no sense as it was never brought up again.

It's furious pace works very well and thanks to some neat camera work it exudes a really great sense of panic and drug induced action.Overall I like this movie a lot, and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of hard hitting tough guy romps.

375,damienkael,That's entertainment,7,1 September 2006,"I have just enjoyed ""Crank"" for all the reasons the earlier post criticised. Jason Statham is ideally cast as a hit-man who has been injected with a deadly poison that requires him to keep his adrenalin pumped to stay alive just long enough to take his revenge. This is not meant to compete with ""Citizen Kane"" as an intellectual challenge. Instead you are treated to a fast-paced action film with an excellent dose of black humour. The jerky camera work fits the frenetic pace but if you found it offputting during episodes of ""NYPD Blue"" this is not for you. I would suggest this would appeal to filmgoers who loved ""Desperado"" and ""Point Break"" for the action sequences and the tongue in cheek humour.",Crank

The writers (and directors) took these three things, tossed them into a movie blender, put the blender on puree, and came out with this movie.The directors (and writers) did some visually awesome things with this film. People on the other side of phone calls appear on walls, rear-view mirrors, and other things. Random words from a person's dialogue appear on screen along with their part of speech in parenthesis afterwards (ep-i-neph-rine (n), man). This visual style I have declared... accidytrip-o-vision.Other movies with accidytrip-o-vision: Easy Rider and A Scanner Darkly.In conclusion, Crank is an action-filled, blood encrusted, comedy haywire, accidytrip-o-vision, adrenaline-pumping achievement.Kudos to Statham and the rest of the team for the new bible of popcorn flicks.",Crank
377,glgoguen,What a waste of my time.,1,28 January 2007,"Hollywood should be ashamed. This is by far the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. Yes I have seen a lot of movies. A mindless plot with of course the worst sex scene that I have ever seen. What were they thinking? Oh right, by the look of this movie, they weren't. I am so glad I didn't see this at the theater or I would have demanded my money back. I still think the $4.99 that I did pay was too much for this crap. Yes I watched the whole movie just praying that is must get better. It did't! Please take this one off the selves so no one else has to suffer like I did. Please Hollywood, stop making these poor and I mean poor movies. I am so tired of renting crap. The world would be a much better place to live",Crank
378,justalittlealien,Was it Real?,9,3 March 2007,"It is a great movie! Funny, touching, sexy, shocking! I loved it! The cinematography was unreal! JS has never let me down when it comes to action movies, and the fun goes on in this one. Very Surprising! I loved the satellite shots, a great take off of 'Enemy of the State'. It has a little bit of everything in it! I just want to know... Was the ""Steel HardOn"" Real?? I had to stop myself from falling down off the couch I was laughing so hard!! I was not expecting a lot, since the previews seemed kinda corny. I think I only had one problem with a character... His girlfriend. She seemed out of touch and phony. Everyone else was awesome! I will have to buy this one!",Crank
379,ceg38323,the action movie to end all actions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,9,23 September 2006,I started to get sick of watching actions... and every action started to become unoriginal then i saw crank and loved it it will be a cult favorite's for the ages.......if you like movies that make you laugh and cringe you will like this 1. If you have seen Jason Statham in REVOLVER and thought it might have missed a few things and had a little to much drama involved...its Statham's impressive job in a leading role yet.If you have never thought of head banging to ACHY BREAKY HEART well this movie will give you a reason.....this movie also made me realize just how big a d-eagle is(hand gun)......this movie is epinephrine on a screen lol you will no what i mean when you see it......,Crank
380,tsiraith,Very fun & fast-paced action flick!,10,18 January 2007,"This movie is just simply fun to watch. I was either smiling or laughing all the way to the end credits. The plot is semi-cliché (dying/dead person comes back to get revenge on those that tried to kill or killed them), but the crazy action sequences and comedy more than make up for it. I loved the surrealistic effects that were sprinkled generously throughout the movie. This added a nice ""Tarantino"" feel to Crank. If comedic, revenge based action movies are up your alley, you cannot miss this movie! Statham plays the part very well. I only wish they would have taken more advantage of his crazy martial arts skills as in the Transporter movies (also very good movies starring Statham). Crank is a wild ride that I highly recommend to anyone who's into seeing a dying man pull all the stops and break all the rules on his ""nothing to lose"" quest to get some payback.",Crank
381,Ruud82,Pretty disappointing,4,15 February 2007,"I believe the movie is much overrated, the acting is pretty poor (to say the least) the story was not really that entertaining. I believe the only reason it might attain a score of 6 is due to the blond girl who looks very nice and the occasional nude. In the beginning you think, hey this might be interesting as the main character is injected with a substance that will kill him within an hour. But I believe the suspense is not build up as the movie progresses. He doesn't seem to be bothered a lot by the substance, and also when he gets shot in the leg he runs down the stair faster than a man in perfectly good health could. All in all a bit incredulous.Other than that I would not recommend viewing it!!",Crank
382,troys66,This was very disappointing,1,10 January 2007,"I was hoping for more from John based on his past hit, Transporter 2. The fight scenes were lame and a lot of times stupid. I'm sure that the script writer enjoyed throwing the F-word in every sentence but it got really old. I really did not like this movie and was extremely disappointed due to the fact that I am such a Statham fan. The movie had that Shaft feel which was another movie I thought sucked. I hope he chooses his scripts a little more wisely on his future films. I missed his awesome fighting and driving and hope the Brazilian job comes to fruition and his part is expanded. The character in Transporter is so fitting I would love to see more of those as well.",Crank
383,ianprosser,What you'd expect,8,1 September 2006,"This is not a movie going for best picture. It's an action movie about a guy who's going to die if he slows down due to a supposed Chinese synthetic drug put into his body. The movie plays almost like a commercial, which makes sense given the director's previous work in the area. The movie never really stops moving, which makes it quite easy to watch for action movie junkies. There are some scenes in it which are so utterly ridiculous that you cannot help but enjoy them...Appreciate it for it is and don't expect great acting or a fantastic plot. Statham does his typical shtick that he uses in both Transporter movies. Amy Smart is quite amusing as his complete ditz of a girlfriend. Even Pedro of Napolean Dynamite fame has a role in the movie. The ending is completely and totally absurd, which fits the movie quite nicely. I'd recommend this if you are wanting to see an action movie that does not take itself too seriously.",Crank
384,aresx-666,Wow... Insane!,9,2 September 2006,"I've seen a lot of action movies in my time... but none has ever made me want to kill someone by ripping out there heart and beat them with a bat like this movie did to me after I saw it. A nonstop action packed thriller that doesn't even bother to stop except for some quick jokes.The movie opens up with a first person view of our hero and him putting in a video that tells him he's got about an hour to live. He rushes out to kill the person who poisoned him and blood, gore, sex, and nonstop action ensuesAs soon i saw the movie i pulled out my mp3 player and played Cannibal Corpse as loud as i could. i seriously felt like i could kick mike Tyson's ass. Go see the movie!!!!",Crank
385,jamie-neale,What a film!!,10,5 October 2006,"Oh my god! I am still rushing from this film! Beautifully shot and edited, Crank is easily one of the best films i have seen in ages. Having seen Stathams other action vehicles, i went in thinking i knew exactly how the film began and ended but this film completely shocked me at its level of originality for a genre that has become tired since the Die Hard trilogy.Crank blends action and dark humour effortlessly, and Statham's acting really surprised me. Now I am pretty biased as I'm a big fan of Jason Statham from his Snatch and Lock Stock days but he really delivered on this film where he failed in The One and Transporter. Not Oscar worthy, but clever enough to carry the unrelenting tempo of the film and showed seem real depth to a character that could of so easily been forgettable in a film like this. He really proved he can be so much more than the East London gangster we've come to know and love.I highly recommend going to see this film at the cinema whilst its there, as it definitely needs to be seen on the big screen to experience the complete trip this film takes you on. The extremes that Chev goes to to keep his heart rate going will have you gasping and crying with laughter and the way this film is put together really makes you feel you are right there in the thick of it.Brutally violent and wickedly funny, i really see this being the cult hit of this year. It far outstrips the underwhelming SOAP with its laugh out loud moments and well put together action sequences (that have a considerable lot less CGI i might add!) And the ending was a truly genius way to finish, not your run-of-the-mill for a film like this.Go see Crank whilst you can! Well worth the price of a ticket to see how the English do things!",Crank
386,tiltedsideways,A terrible film,1,3 September 2006,"Went to the theater hoping to see a great action film about a hit-man and was hoping for a great storyline. It was the opposite, this film had a terrible storyline (Or none at all) camera angles all bad, (I bet even the people who saw and liked the movie noticed some of the angles did not fit the scene. Way to much use of the word Fk. The deaths were really fake looking, racist to the max. And don't forget about the terrible story, a hit-man gets poisoned. He find out he has to use adrenaline to live. He goes to a hospital to get adrenaline, he finds his girl friend.He kills the guy who poisoned him by falling off a helicopter and strangling him on his way down to his death. The only good part was the girls. Which like only 5 of them were nice looking. I give this 1/10",Crank
387,jmpblack,stat-ham's only good role was in collateral,1,1 September 2006,"I've seen transporter 1 and 2 and i thought both had good action scenes in it but had no plot and i saw crank too which was the exact same type of movie but worse. it had no plot, and i walked out after the sex scene with Amy smart. who names a movie crank anyway. I'm sick of stat-hams voice and the best role he's ever had was when he was in collateral for about 1 minute. every time i see one of his movies is coming out it looks good but I'm always disappointed when i see it. anyone who thinks tranporter 1 and 2 were good, alright, but crank, then i clearly disagree with you and obvioussly you don't know much about a good movie.",Crank
388,rmcgrenaghan,huh?,3,1 September 2006,"Well, though I don't fully disagree with the first comments opinion, I don't think some parts of what he said were very true. I must have missed the parts glorifying violence, there were two parts that i can remember with some unique violence, I have seen much worse, for example, Man on Fire was one hundred times worse than this crap. I was disappointed in the lack of violence actually, the trailers make it seem as if it's a non-stop thrill ride, there is a lack of action, and when something exciting does happen, you blink and it's over. There are many random parts that are basically pointless time fillers in the movie, and there is no time for a build up to the plot, the man just wakes up and he's poisoned. Nothing really made me want him to get revenge, all I know was something happened on some hit and so they poisoned him. I was confused after the first five minutes, don't waste your time with this movie.",Crank
389,matt_505,Wow...,10,1 September 2006,"wow is all i can say. This movie is non stop action, weird action, and weird stuff. best movie since boondock saints. amazing. i am in shock and wont sleep for a few nights because of this genius piece. The small things in this movie make you wonder what the creators were thinking, and why they thought of the stuff they did. random half naked girls suspended above a penthouse patio? what the heck, seriously. I would pay another 8 dollars in a heartbeat to go see this movie again if i wasn't a struggling college kid. but i am glad i took a Friday night and 10 bucks to see it. GO SEE IT. In order to enjoy this movie, temporarily suspend your reality, and let yourself get lost in this movie. say things to your neighbor, like ""what the heck"". I mean it, this movie is whacked and amazing.",Crank
390,zguyx,Go.. watch.. now..,10,1 September 2006,"I have to say that this movie by far is worth my eight bucks. Over the past summer a lot of movies have come out that have lots of action and adventure, but either the action scenes are so drawn out that they lose the sense of action or have adventure that is so amazing that it seems like you're watching 1000 old children's books in one sitting. This may be some people's slice of heaven, but not mine. I get bored easy. That being said, I wasn't bored once this movie.This movie takes everything you've ever wanted to do that was crazy, stupid, freaky or just plain retarded and rolled it into a big joint of every freaky drug there is out there. Thus, you find yourself (the audience)gladly suckling at the content before you like a hungry baby on a warm breast. Speaking of which, this movie shows a few of them.This movie is over the top and contains all the really icky things that normal movies that meander into theaters to try and pawn from you your eight dollars stray from. Blood, sex(the outdoorsy type with on- lookers, no less), violence, depravity, drugs and humor from compromising situations(I.E. A sewing machine used as a make-shift hand blender, or some oral loving with no happy ending). By far the best thing about this movie is the direction of the sequences as they unfold.. not once did I stop and go, ""BORING!"" or say to myself ""yeah, saw that coming."" Instead, I found myself entranced because the director gives you everything in short, sweet chunks. Action scenes are smoking hot where at times you find yourself reeling in the ""OH MY GAWD, did he just do that?? Yes, YES HE DID"" moments. The comedy weaved in and out at impeccable times. Seldom did I see how funny Jason Statham was in any of his previous movies, this one puts the icing on the cake. It seems as though all of his other movies through the generic character he was type-casted to play built up to this movie and it almost seems like a parody of all the action movies (him in them or not), until it stands on it's own two feet at the end.This review is not to give you any hot-off the press spoilers. I don't want that. I want you to throw down your cash to go see a movie that you'll actually enjoy and tell yourself for the first time this summer that you saw a movie that was worth the time and money.(As a side note, I would definitely NOT recommend this movie for kids under 18. It has some extremely vulgar content and is blatant with it's visuals and humor. Sneaking your kid into this movie with you would only show your kid that getting high, killing people and trying to kill yourself is morally acceptable and that worse yet, they'll live from that. That's my public service announcement. That is all.)",Crank
391,maniator,stupid movie,1,3 September 2006,"this was a very bad movie. it sucked and it should not have even gotten a half of a star. I'm sorry but he was better in the transporter and i didn't even see that movie!!! nobody go to this movie if you were planning on it. and most of the time the plot made no sense at all. i wanted to be somewhere else during the whole movie. also his role was not as good as he was in the other movies that he was in earlier. i should not have been called crank -- it should have been called a ""waste of my time and seven bucks!"" also there was not much of him using adrenaline -- a lot of just walking around -- what is up with that? i was not expecting that from this type of movie.",Crank
392,attono,"Unfortunately, it was a great disappointment",2,4 September 2006,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie,but to be honest it was a great disappointment. The coming attractions for the movie were great, but overall it was simply just a ""ridiculous"" movie. I take nothing away from Jason Statham. He is a great actor and that is why I went. So if you're a fan of his go see it, but if you think the movie will be great,just don't set you standard too high. However, I will say there were a few scenes that I was happy to see and did stand out and will stand out. I don't think this will become a cult movie, it will simply just fade away. Again, Jason Statham is such a fantastic actor he carried this movie, other then that not too much to go for.",Crank
393,mia5793,I enjoyed myself,9,4 September 2006,"I suppose part of the reason that I liked this movie is that the film was prefaced for me with ""It's great...kind of corny, but in a 'we-know-it's-corny' way"" by the girl at the ticket booth. If you keep that in mind, you can really enjoy the movie. It's funny in a ""what the hell"" sort of way, but the action is great and suspense is built well and released at the right times with funny scenes. I got a kick out of watching it. Just don't expect a movie called ""Crank"" to incorporate global themes of the human condition...it just won't. It's entertaining and pretty shocking, and worth seeing in theatres because action films are just better when they're bigger :-P",Crank

395,tbraseth,Nothing more than a director's demo reel.,1,6 September 2006,"I don't know what movie these good reviews are referring to. ""Crank"" was the worst movie I have ever seen on just about every level - and I am a fan of action movies. The only good thing coming out of this movie was how it united the audience and got everyone in the theater lingering after the closing credits to debate just how awful this movie was. First of all, it's simply a remake of ""Speed"" with Jason Statham playing the bus. It's like a movie by a 15 year old for 15 year olds - nothing clever, nothing smart, no sense for good story-telling. It's just toilet humor, sex jokes and lots of senseless over-the-top violence. It has all the plot of a video game with our protagonist navigating a series of obstacles, picking up strength along the way while obliterating everything in his path. There's no story arc, no surprise, no doubt as to what is going to happen next.This is a movie without a single redeeming factor. You feel nothing but revulsion for the ""hero"" who has no regard for anyone or anything other than himself. And Amy Smart does a disservice to women for portraying a ditzy dumb-blonde who sleeps till noon oblivious to her urgently ringing phone before a) having sex on the sidewalk in front of hundreds of on-lookers in a rape-turns-into-hot-sex scene, b) performing fellatio on her boyfriend during a car-chase scene, c) stopping dead in her tracks during a foot-chase to announce that she forgot to take her birth control pills, d) digging the fact that her boyfriend is a wanton killer, and e) spending the entire film falling out of her flimsy dress and spilling the contents of her purse at the most inopportune moments. (We're supposed to laugh ""typical girl!"")A litany of the awfulness includes:The nausea-inducing shaking, spinning camera.A ""hero"" who kills everyone in his path, including innocent by-standers and hospital patients on gurneys. (hilarious)The glorification of cocaine and epinephrine abuse.The glorification of rape and public sex.A concrete bunker-like building that bulges like a cartoon tent from the bar-fight within.A fight scene in which the antagonist punches our ""hero"" with the bloody stump from a freshly lopped off hand, followed by our hero shooting him with a gun still in the grip of the dismembered hand.A ten minute scene of our hero falling from a helicopter (which would take mere seconds in real life) during which he calmly places a phone call to his girlfriend before splattering to the ground.I'm all for suspension of disbelief, but puh-leeeeze.This movie is nothing more than a demo-reel for a director who wants to show off all the neat tricks he can do with a camera. I can only assume that all the positive reviews on this site were planted by the friends and family of the movie-makers.",Crank
396,megnog_17,One of the worst movies I've paid for in a long time.,2,9 September 2006,"I wish I could say that I had some hope for this movie when it first started, but I can't. Even from the first few minutes, the over-the-top cinematography gave me a headache. Some of the dialog is just horrible. The characters are unbelievable. At one point, me and my boyfriend (who loves Jason Statham and really wanted to see this movie) both threw our hands up in the air in a ""WHAT?!"" sort of way. The sad part is that this movie had potential. The concept was interesting. But the script wasn't great, and then the movie was really killed in post production. I spent most of the movie shifting uncomfortably in my seat. Thankfully, it wasn't very long.",Crank
397,jobo868,The Movie Crank,3,15 September 2006,"I saw Jason Statham for the first time in ""Transporter2"" and thoroughly enjoyed the movie and especially Jason. When I saw that he had another movie at theaters, called Crank, my wife and I wanted to see it. So we went and were we disappointed. The lewd actions in the movie ruined for both of us. There is too much of this in our theaters and films. Society expects hope in a better world and like a lot of films today they give us sex, doom and gloom. I will never watch another film with Jason Statham in it, unless he cleans up us image and makes more movies like ""Transporter2"" So in closing, and this is directed at you Jason Statham, ""Clean up your act, you have a great potential to make one of the greatest action stars.

I didn't even know what it was about when I went,and I was pleasantly surprised. I am a 19 year old female and I thought it was great. It was very intense the whole way through! It would be very awkward to see this movie with your grandparents or parents (depending how open-minded they are). So definitely go with friends or siblings! I know it mentioned on this sight that it is similar to Run-Lola-Run. I agree, I also think it was better. It reminded me of a Quentin Tarantino movie (strange, gruesome fight scenes and quirky humor parts). Go see this movie if you like sex, drugs and violence.....",Crank

Although this is, without a doubt, his best movie yet as the main character. Efren Ramirez (or Pedro, from Napoleon Dynamite) was here too and he had a pretty cool role. Amy Smart is hot so yeah.. thats self-explanatory. There's a cameo by Chester from Linkin Park somewhere in the movie. Watch out for him.definitely worth watching it in the theater and/or watching it multiple times. especially for the guys. girls may enjoy it too.i was told there will be stuff after the credits but i cant find a vid for it.. so i guess ya'll better stay during the credits if you haven't watched it yet. i think it has some references to the game Berzerk.

Strange thing is I originally thought this was going to be dull but I luffed it. It's nice when you find a movie that satisfies your current cravings.*Small Spoiler* Basic plot of the movie: Main character gets poisoned and has to keep his adrenaline pumping to stay alive which makes for a fast paced movie with plenty of action from start to finish. *End Spoiler* Most people won't care but there's a little bit at the end of the credits that doesn't add to the story at all but it's a nice little bonus if you're the kind of person that waits till the credits are finished in the hopes of something extra....surely I'm not the only one. >_<If you like this then I also recommend Running Scared (2006)....much of the same but a little darker in parts.",Crank
402,konradj-1,One of the worst movies ever seen...,1,15 October 2006,"I didn't want to post anything about this movie, as I already wasted enough time by watching this. But I thought to myself that I should warn some people before they sit down to watch this, or worst yet if you're getting ready to spend money on this film. After watching the trailer for this film, I was not expecting too much in terms of plot, but I thought the action could be good. Well, no such luck. Let me start off with the good parts of this film. I kind of like the actor. From the time I saw Snatch I became a fan. Transporter was good, yet Transporter 2 was a bit of a let down. Yet this movie goes beyond Transporter 2. First of all, what happened to realism in this film? There is NONE what so ever. The special effects in this movie are awful to say the least. It's like some geek made them on his computer at home. Well, maybe not that bad, but I've seen much better. Maybe the problem was the budget, but this comes as no surprise as I don't know who put up the money to finance this movie. This movie can best be compared to a first-person-shooter video game. The main character goes around town shooting people up, cops never chase him, and when they do... somehow they just vanish into thin air after 2 seconds of chasing him. To sum up this movie: if you don't like to think, not even use a brain cell, during a movie, and realism is not a factor for you, and you just like people firing their guns around town, this movie is for YOU! :) Cheers;",Crank

Its Violent, Fast, Sexy, Drug Orientated and has some hilarious humour thrown in to finish this movie masterpiece. Statham plays the role of a Dying man injected with Chinese Death Crack ""Crank"" If He stops moving he dies. He has just a short time left to kill those who poisoned him and does it with style. While taking every drug he can to stay dialed up and survive, he still must save his girlfriend and tell her he has little time left. The love scene in the China Town mall is hilarious and the poor old ladies budgie copped it big time LOL!!. Well worth every penny and a huge step up from the Transporter Series.

I agree with Ziad on how well an actor Jason Statham is. He plays the whole hit-man/misunderstood bad guy role perfectly and he WOULD be a better actor, in my opinion, than Vin diesel in the movie ""Hitman Codname:47"", Vin diesel just don't have the hit-man look to him, don't get me wrong he is a great actor, just no hit-man.This movie would be even better if it had an alternate ending where he did live and him and Eve flew to another country and lived happily ever after, kinda like the first XXX where Vin diesel and the chick flew to bora bora.",Crank

This movie will be one of those cult hits that we gush about in the forums and compare to future action movies for years to come.I have always been a fan of Jason Statham and this movie has finally delivered that knock-out punch I have been waiting for. Amy Smart and Efren Ramirez have confirmed themselves as talents to keep an eye out for.I must also comment on the awesome and creative filming and editing that puts Crank in the same league as Momento, Domino and The Jacket for me.

406,dpwhite-1,Baaaad,2,2 November 2006,"The concept itself seems interesting. If executed skilfully could probably match 'Speed'. It wasn't, and it didn't. If there was anything good about the movie it was dwarfed by the bad the stupid and the pathetic. The public sex scene would probably top the pile. What was good for 'Emmanuelle' was worse than bad for 'Crank'. It just didn't work. Like everything else. On any level. And if it worked, it was just like with the majority of the scenes - to bring the movie down. And the 'inventive' camera-work, man, it really did match the whole film level perfectly. A total lack of respect for the viewer and utterly narcissistic self-indulging exercise. I would only imagine a self-absorbed insensitive teenage director with pathological testosterone malfunction and loads of money to burn for his own kicks, to produce this sort of garbage. It makes me wonder who was injected with that 'Chinese s**t', the protagonist or the makers of the movie. Hope they will recover fast. After a long holiday and some soul searching they actually might make a movie with much less 'adrenaline' and more simple heart in it. I say that only because there were some glimpses of good work. Unfortunately the glimpses weren't enough to counterbalance the overload of crap.",Crank

If you don't like camera work that is jerky and fast with random 'flashes' all over the place then please don't rent this movie. There are tons of comments here about this movie being fantastic - I don't know how everyone else got past the camera work. I was actually looking forward to this one, concept seemed great with tons of action but I only got through about ten minutes of it before I had to shut if off. The camera-work in this movie didn't enhance the 'action packed' feeling for me at all, in fact it made me feel like they were trying to cover up a terrible plot and acting with extremely exaggerated camera movements. It reminded me of a really cheap low budget films (like route 666 with Lou Diamond) which was a huge disappointment.",Crank

I think it sucked having read the original myself. Once again stay tuned I am fully prepared to prove this claim. I just will not do so until I have the proper protection in place.

Since he only has an hour to live and he can only stay alive by keeping his blood pumping, well you know there will be a lot going on.Ill try not to give it away, but the ending is fantastic.

Don't expect a good action movie, it has more of a 'Snakes on a plane' feel. But everything about this movie is simply hilarious, and the slow film speed gives it a very interesting look. Don't even try to follow the plot, or wonder why Jason Statham gets right up and runs away after getting shot. Nothing makes sense.

I've enjoyed Jason in his major movies yet the totally unnecessary sex scene in public totally left me cold. I don't care if it was his reality, it has no place in any public non-X rated showplace. The only thing it shows is the contempt the producers have for women and for their own personal issues. I've noticed that some of his other non-American movies also resort to the same type of disregard of dignity as is shown here. I guess the producers could have an alternate version on the DVD.

What is the rationale of taking _all_ your clothes off when in the hospital? Why is always the remedy illegal drugs (both up's and down's)?

Transporter 2 was a little retarded when he tore the bomb off the bottom of the car with the crane winch. Hint: If you really love Jason Statham you should watch London.

424,jamesaston903-1,Nothing less than awful. Absolute crap.,1,11 September 2007,"This is not a bad idea, but it's awfully executed. The plot is wafer thin. Why the directors couldn't have developed it a bit is beyond me. The problem with a plot this thin is that it becomes tiresome after about 45 minutes; if the characters were better developed then it would be easier to overlook the plot, but they aren't.Because the characters are unbelievable and the plot is non-existent, it's easy to notice inconsistencies. All of the stereotypical black gangsters that make an appearance early on have guns, which they point at Statham's character. When he head-butts one of them, nobody draws a gun.The characters range from two-dimensional to unrealistic to annoying. Let's start with Statham's character 'Chev'. He's English, and he's called Chev. Riiiight. He's the central character yet all we find out about him is that he's a hit-man with a bimbo girlfriend and is good friends with a doctor (what luck!).The doc is a cursing, 'cool' doctor. Very unrealistic. And the girlfriend is a waste of space. She fits directly into one of the many stereotypes in this film. In fact, I don't think there's a single character, either major or minor that is not a stereotype. Whether it's the stereotype of ''ard men', Mexicans, blonde's, Asians, blacks, they're all in this film.Can I also add that Jason Statham should not be allowed to talk in films, let alone be a leading man. He's rubbish. None of the actors are particularly good. Statham shows up as second-worst behind his on-screen squeeze.And why is there so much bigotism? Sexism, racism, homophobia. All of that rears its head multiple times. There's no need for it, and it just shows the script as being desperate as opposed to being funny or cool.I can't believe this piece of toss was directed by 2 people. I've never done as much as direct traffic and I could have done a better job. These men should not be allowed to as much as work in a cinema.And don't get me started on the scene where Statham almost rapes his girlfriend in front of a crowd of people, including children.Maybe it's because I've been watching so many Scorsese movies recently, but this one seemed more dire than even The Transporter. Waste of time. Don't bother unless you're under 15 or have no taste in good movies.",Crank
425,usahuman,This is the most underrated action movie GO RENT IT NOW,10,30 December 2007,"Jason Statham is a very unique actor. He's got the emotional depth of the shallow end of the pool that has no diving board. I have not since been as satisfied with a movie of this caliber EVER. The duologue was very clear, and coherent, THe irony of this movie is that Jason's Masculinity is never compromised by showing any of his possible emotional acting abilities, and the reason is because the whole story, was an emotional roller coaster for it's viewers. SO can you see the irony now, one of the most un-emotional actors you can imagine, is chosen to play the lead role in a movie with emotional depth of the Marinas trench. The movie had 2 scenes which I personally believe were intended to spin a web around all of the crooked, and unbelievable film critics who they knew would watch the movie. The director of this movie basically let the audience that know that he did't give a flying f*ck whether or not it made any money because his main purpose was to establish the rare qualities of unusually masculine men who are born in England. He was also wither totally for, or totally against the mall chase scene. If he was against it it was because he was more concerned with his own reputation, and if he was for the mall chase scene then he was more concerned with intentionally losing the trust of his audience, with the knowledge that within 30 minutes he would have the total trust of all his audience. Overall I think that the action sequences in this film completely over power, out perform, and out wit those of the highly praised and very well awarded ""Jason Bourne"" trilogy action sequences. What makes ""cranks"" action scenes so bewildering, and awe inspiring is because of 1 simple thing we'll call it the missing ingredient. It is what is missing in of all 3 of the Jason Bourne movies; the directors of Mission Impossible 3 proved that this essential ingredient I am hinting around at, isn't necessary for a movie to make a large multi-million dollar profit. But they also proved at the same time to the rest of Hollywood the public, and the rest of the film critiquing business industry public to realize how full of sh*t 75 % of the film critics are. It's a tragedy actually, if they would have eliminated a scene which must have been very expensive considering that the car literally appeared to be racing down the middle of a busy shopping mall, not to mention the fact they also showed the LAPD squad cars actually following him down the center of the mall. and used that money to strategically distribute that money in as many different markets as they could. In conclusion I am obliged to tell you that I am naively passionate about anybody with any connection or insightful knowledge even remotely true about Hollywood, I am the first in line to try and find out what they know. As far as tabloids go, well I suppose the obsession they have with the sane handful of people week after week, month after month, and even year after year can be summed up with one of the greatest quites to have ever been belched out by , no other than Mr. W.C. Fields himself ""You can never go broke betting on the stupidity of the American public."" SO I beg your pardon for the lack of rhythm to compliment the flow of my alphabetical assembly. To sum it all up : ""If you have not seen this movie ; then you've got a hidden treasure waiting for you the next time you decide to rent a movie.Please reply with any positive, or especially negative feedback you have for what I have posted.

426,shallowbayr,An adrenaline filled thriller!,10,13 January 2009,"Crank is an adrenaline filled, quick moving thriller about a professional hit man (Statham) who finds himself in a dire situation when he wakes up to discover he has been poisoned. Now he only has several hours left to attempt to kill the man that did this to him, say goodbye to his girl, and go out with a bang. This movie was an extremely unique and thoroughly enjoyable experience. The style of direction by Mark Neveldine was something new and exciting. Adding things such as text on the screen, animations and certain shots such as having a reflection of the person Statham was talking to on the phone in his rear view mirror for example, were very fun. He also used split screen shots well, which really helped put you in two places at once. This movie starts fast and rarely lets up. The poison basically slows his heart down, and the only way to counteract it is pure adrenaline, so Statham sets out doing a range of things from drinking a large quantity of assorted energy drinks, to high speed pursuits with the police. For me, this movie just worked on all levels. The action, humor, and drama blended together perfectly. Statham really nailed the role of this angry, ruthless, lovable hit man on the path of revenge. Amy Smart pulled off the role of Statham's caring but rather clueless girlfriend and Jose Pablo Cantillo was a perfect villain that you love to hate. All in all, this movie brought new ideas to the table and executed on them very well. A must see for action/crime lovers.",Crank

The front cover was catchy. It looked like a nice movie, so I rented it. What did I get when I watched it? A very overrated and poor storyline type of movie.The main character should have died in the first 10min of the movie. Almost all of the stunts looked fake. I could not wait for the movie to end, so that I could take it back. And what still amaze me is that Crank 2 is on its way. I thought that Chev died. Any normal guy would have been dead, but I guess Crank defy science. I really like Jason Statham, but even with him, its still a complete waste. Summery: Don't watch it.",Crank
428,cozi,Only if there is nothing better on...,5,21 September 2006,"From the outset your average cinema attendee will see this film as a Statham reprisal of his Transporter roll, seemingly invincible in a high action, no-nonsense beat-em-up. But Crank is slightly different...The concept feels like this has been taken straight from a computer game, Injected with a Chineese potion, Chev Chellios (statham) has under an hour to live, but finds that the poison injected to slow his heart and kill him, can be subsided by keeping his adrenalin high and the heart pumping. You can guess the rest, its stunts, escapes, brawls, whilst he trys to extend his 1 hour life span but also inflict Stathemesque revenge on the perpetrators. Surprisingly the action and adventure does have you holding your breath for a good part into the film, but seems to allow you to breath out too early before the end. The story becomes repetitive and in its attempt to bring it back on track, we lose the 'new and interesting' feeling and get the 'we've seen this in other films-get-on with it' ambiance. There are countless scenes of nudity in the film, which bare little resemblance to the story line, but Ms Smart's appearance will level the balance for the males in the audience. Without reading too much into the less than great story line, but interesting concept and If you can keep with the fast paced changes of camera angle, pitch and colour, you'll be in for an enjoyable hour or so.",Crank
429,crinkled,an essay on absurdity,8,18 October 2014,"I'm sure you'll agree with me here: bad guys are stupid. When they finally have their nemesis overpowered, they just can't avoid talking just a bit too much or coming up with some ridiculous ""slow death"" to kill their victim. It is indeed their downfall. Without these precious moments, our hero wouldn't have enough time to free himself. (take for example Tuco and the one-armed man from ""The Good, the bad, and the Ugly."" After killing him, Tuco says, ""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk."")""Crank"" – starring Jason Statham and Amy Smart, can basically be seen as an essay on how absurd things can get when you don't kill your victim asap. It's that small instant of freedom stretched into 90 minutes of movie mayhem. And oh what mayhem!The premise for Crank is simple and clever: Chev Chelios needs to keep the adrenaline pumping or else his heart will fail; he's been injected with some ""synthetic Chinese sh*t"" that should kill him within the hour. Being the professional hit-man that he is, he figures out that he can stay alive long enough to execute his revenge.Watching Chelios look for his next hit of adrenaline is absolutely hilarious. He starts inhaling coke: good, but not good enough. He gets into any fight he can. He rides his car through the mall. He takes artificial adrenaline (after breaking into the hospital to steal it, of course). He pays his dear girlfriend a visit he must do everything and anything he can or else his heart will stop pumping and there will be no more crazy epinephrine-searching moments.Insanely funny and chock full of imagery for the pop culture enthusiasts, ""Crank"" gets the juices flowing and never lets down. For example, the filmmakers use ""Google map"" to illustrate the different locations where the action is going to take place. I guess they reduced the movie budget there quite a bit!Don't expect plot or character development (though they're there, and they're not exactly moronic) beyond that of the basics. This is a full- blown action movie that makes fun of its surroundings although it never does it to a point so as to not take the action seriously. The action scenes are excellently crafted and the camera work is dizzyingly delightful.A certified B-movie effort in its unusual style, ""Crank"" is among the funniest, most action-packed movies you'll see this year. But you can't take it seriously. It's an amusing, wild ride meant to entertain for the length of its duration. No more can be asked of it. Except maybe a sequel",Crank

I like Jason Statham, in the roles he's respectable in, Snatch, Lock Stock, and to a lesser degree, The Transporter. Amy Smart? Not so much.The day before the movie comes out, I see a commercial for it on Comedy Central. I see an over the top action movie, nothing worthy of Oscars, no sir, but not a movie that takes itself seriously, a la Snakes on a MFin' Plane. I am excited. The premise of Speed, but a person, intrigues me. Because I'm male. I check IMDb, and it's only 83 minutes. This doesn't upset me, because it means high-energy movie that won't slow down.""But Dane, what about the movie? How was it?"" It was 83 minutes of High Energy action, and doesn't slow down.

But in my eyes this is a masterpiece. The cutting and editing are made in an artistic way, not even close to an ordinary action movie. Some may say that it doesn't make any sense, but in my eyes that turned out to be the best in the movie. The fast pacing lasts and lasts, until the end, (may be spoiler alert) and than Chelios opens his eyes, just makes you want to see Crank II. The acting was also very good, from Jason Statham, he seems to put is life into it, to Amy Smart, and even the doctor played by Dwight Yoakam (I had to check that one out).

What I'm talking about is not taking no crap from no one, being in total control of any situation, and looking cool while doing it.This movie has those moments, to be sure, and Chev Chelios is probably the most realistically flawed action hero possibly ever, making this a cut above most action fair.As another poster pointed out, there aren't that many traditional fight scenes, and there definitely is little of Statham's more acrobatic fighting skills on display, but Badassery does abound. Kickass car chases, lots of Statham takin' a lickin' and keepin' on kickin', and a pretty awesome cameo by the ol' flesh forty-five maker for some thoroughly enjoyable action.I personally thought that the story too was a cut above as well. The themes of egocentricity, the ""hard life"" gone wrong, and just living too fast all kind of hit home for me. Our world is all about a breakneck pace, and it will kill you, given half a chance.This has some things in common with revenge movies, but I wouldn't call it a revenge thriller, more of a race towards death. Where most action movies delve into our basic survival instinct, Crank takes us through it and beyond, showing us peace in an acceptance of death.Plus, Jason Statham freaking rules.WHOA-YEA-UH!!!!",Crank

436,trble122,Crank,1,10 February 2007,"This movie contains strongly offensive messages concerning racism, sexism, homophobia, the works. Not only does it perpetuate commonly inappropriate stereotypes but it comes dangerously close to encouraging them. Although the trailer may have hinted at some sort of plot, there is none. In fact, there is no back story what-so-ever. Honestly, you will ask for your 87 minutes back. I have no clue how people can rate this anything but a 1. And contrary to the message in the movie, it is far from an adrenaline rush. In fact, it may be one of the worst movies ever made.

I can not recommend this movie enough it's like speed crossed between die hard crossed between hard boiled crossed between commando, crossed between Rambo 3 crossed between the A Team crossed between Terminator 2 crossed between John woo sitting in a corner, shaking high on a cocktail of speed and crack cocaine, crossed between me talking rubbish to make up the amount of lines that is needed to post this review.

I watched it to the end and it just got worse.I had expected it to be up there with Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Transporter or even Layer cake (different actor), which are three movies I would really rate, but sadly this is one I would steer my friends away from.Yes, it had a few funny moments but the story line is garbage, it reminds me of those old ""B"" grade movies from the 50's.I've read many a review on this site over the last several years and this is the first time a movie has made me make a comment.If you see this in the rental area along side say ""The Departed"" it's no contest The Departed is what good movies are about.",Crank

442,uncouthdude,"Fast paced, mind-less, fairly ridiculous!",3,1 July 2008,"My perspective: I knew little about this movie before I saw it, had seen the main character in other films and have for the most part usually liked his style. As I'm watching the movie (about 1/2 way through) I'm thinking: ""This movie is 'GAR.... BAGE!!'"". Later, I heard (read) somewhere that it's based on a video game. I don't know, but if so, it figures.First some good points: The movie moves fairly fast-paced. There is the customary ""cute"" chick. Various psychotic enemies, the customary car chase scenes, and, of course, gun-play and ""killin"" by our equally psychotic main character.This movie however, seems geared at entertaining people that identify with the title. People ON ""crank"", or whatever else. I'm a bit confused by the ratings this movie has. Rating putting it on par with, say, ""Hitman"", and better than say, ""La Femme Nikita"". How can this be? There is for the most part only mind-less, patched together acts of violence, marginally funny utterances, and seizure invoking camera work. I guess for people who can't sit still to watch anything for more than a few minutes without the urge to ""click"" a remote control.I can only guess that it must be the ""dumb, white girl"" getting ""boned"" scenes that drive up the ratings on movies like this.Not worth paying for.",Crank

This movie has everything that the male brain desires when it's being fueled by booze.

444,toodleymoodley,Fu*king Stupid. 8/10,8,23 September 2016,"This movie is really really really stupid. And it knows that it's stupid. Thats exactly what i appreciate the most about Crank. It's mindless, dumb, entertaining action and it doesn't try to be more then that. It begins around the minute 2 which is absolutely amazing. It sounds like it's not much but it shows what the directors were going for. No 30-40 stupid plot bullshit before the real action starts. You're getting thrown into the movie and BAM! The action takes off. Something that should happen more often. If you try to make a reasonable explanation for killing thousands of people and do spectacular daredevil stunts you are likely going to fail. Just watch this movie and you know what to do. If you wanna make an action movie don't forget the most important part: The action. It's like porn. The story is expected but not all that important. So make it like Crank: Simple, self-explanatory, fast and quick. And tadaa! An action movie that isn't The Expendables 2-3.",Crank

Intense action yet there are a lot more laughs than Stratham movies usually have. All action fans and interest film students should see this film.Chev Chelios, played by Jason Stratham, is poisoned at the very beginning of the film with the Beijing Cocktail. He will die if his adrenaline isn't maxing out. This sets the course for his rampage of the city happening on the streets, in malls, in hospitals, in cars, on bikes. He does whatever it takes to keep the adrenaline going, so he can have his revenge. Amy Smart played her usual role as Chev's girlfriend.

Sex, drugs, crappy metal music, 16 car chases, gore, boner jokes, etc.However, as an adult no thanks. I like action movies like Leon, however this was nothing of the sort. No emotional connection just a string of super high contrast action scenes that make you laugh from the sheer ridiculousness of it all.So if you're a 15 year old boy, I'm sure you could watch this 100 times in a row, but for everyone else it's a waste of an hour.",Crank
447,luistx,87 minutes?? Perfect!!!,7,1 September 2006,"87 minutes perfect maybe not but almost. I'm the the type of person that sometimes over analyze movies when it comes to shots, stunts, cgi and other thing of that short. But with this movie i had no time to do any of this it was fast but fast in a good way and when it slows down which is like never i was trying to catch my breath from laughing. I usually think for a movie to be good it has to be at least 120 minutes long (i.e. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Godfather, Ben-Hur, Platoon, Gladiator,Shashank, Titanic, Pulp fiction, Goodfellas, Good, Bad and the Ugly etc....) I'm not saying it's in that same league as the few movies i mentioned but for a movie so short its just as entertaining as any of those. I saw the some of the other posts, 87 minutes might not be the best bang for your buck with ticket prices these days, but it certainly is the best bang for your minutes.--lol- Maybe I'm just saying this because i got to see for free and almost before anyone else; i got a free pass at a store as a promotion. I hoped the movie would be good but as in the past few years i hope the same for a lot of movies but then i leave a little disappointed i had almost forgotten how it feels to leave a movie theater with expectations matched and exceeded. In my opinion for action movies its an instant classic along with The Professional and Enter the Dragon and if anyone can name another one please do so..-I think its was about time for an action movie revival hopefully the directors of this film can get something original for a story line for a Tony Ja movie. Now as await for another good action movie i hope The Protector is not O-Bak 2 the story sucked. -Well now that i think about one thing that did disappoint me is that it did not have as much physical action as as both of the Transporter movies but well nothing is perfect but coming close for an action movie is not bad at all. Now if Ja and Statham could do something together that would be interesting but i doubt it will ever happen.",Crank

Put this together with the 2 Transporter films and you have about 4 1/2 hours of the most unwatchable films in film history. I mean, what stupid junk are they going to try to sell us next? This guy has zero acting ability, so they just put him in movies where he can run around killing people. After watching Transporter and the sequel (my girlfriend rented it on night and I was too tired to argue about watching it), I thought that no writer could write something dumber than these. Then, I watched about 45 minutes of Crank and realized that I was SO wrong. Only the writing was worse than the acting. Can someone please tell me why Amy Smart gets movie roles? In this movie, she should have been billed as Amy Moron, not Smart. What an insult to all of womanhood to write or play a role like that. They should take the writers out and put them out of our misery. PLEASE...NO MORE!",Crank

Don't wanna put any spoilers, so I'll just say I think the special effects suck, it doesn't have any slow motion frames and in some points the movie looks more like a cartoon fiction than something that can really happen, especially at the end and I don't mean you'll think ""Wow he must be lucky"" but ""Isn't that supposed to look a lot lot different and what drugs did the makers use before making that scene, to forget all the physics, mechanics and biology from the real world"".",Crank
450,gkknecht,A wonderful movie,8,8 September 2006,"This movie, in my opinion, is one of the best movies to come out this summer. If you like The Transporter (the first one only though, because the second one was awful), and like Jason Statham, this one is a winner. The movie is actually very short, only about an hour and a half, but it seems to be just as long as any other 2 hour feature. This is because there really are no ""down times"" in the movie. From start to finish the movie is just about 100% action. Jason Statham is perfect for this roll, and pulls it off wonderfully. The plot wasn't horribly complicated, but it still was entertaining. Certain camera shots and things such as the subtitles had a ""Tarentino"" ring to them. In short, this movie is very entertaining, action packed, creative, violent, and fun. I'd recommend this movie to just about any guy over 17. This is most definitely a ""guy movie.""",Crank
451,tristan-81,Hilariously awesome.,9,28 September 2006,"This movie will, if there is any justice in the world, go down in the history books as one of the most bad-ass movies, right up there with Fight Club. The opening title sequence, done in an 80's arcade game style with energetic rave music pounding, makes it apparent that the filmmakers are having fun, and it's hard for one not to get drawn in by their enthusiasm. Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor borrow the premise of Dead on Arrival and transform it into the funnest action vehicle ever--Chev, a hit-man for hire has been poisoned with a new synthetic toxin from Hong Kong. The toxins in Chev's blood can only be slowed down by adrenaline. It's as simple as that: keep moving, keep fighting, stay excited or frightened, and you live.Of course the pursuit of the man who poisoned him keeps him occupied with shootouts and car chases, but he still must find ways to keep himself alert in between. Robbing convenience stores of all their energy drinks, getting into bar fights, snorting coke, and sex are just a few of his impromptu solutions.With a premise that seems to be expressly designed for non-stop action, there is always the risk (dare I say the probability) that the movie's creators will disregard the details and create something sickeningly superficial. Crank is an exception. The movie is overflowing with creative touches and hilarious dialog. It has great pacing, with just enough downtime in all the right places. What's more, it has good characters and good acting to boot. Chev's girlfriend is so endearing and cute there's no wonder why he would fall in love with her, and seeing the way he treats her there's no doubt that he has.The plot is, ironically, difficult to understand toward the end, when the events leading up to the movie's beginning are revealed, but if you didn't mind the plot holes in Fight Club you'll have no problems ignoring the ones in Crank.The movie's downside is its frequent post-MTV video editing. Going split-screen for phone conversations is one thing, but blending that second screen into the environment--projected on a wall or in the rear view mirror of a car--is another.All things considered, this is the summer blockbuster that we deserve after several let downs. It's the perfect movie to see with a group of friends, but even alone I laughed out loud quite a bit. I would compare the experience to a mix between Pulp Fiction and Run Lola Run.",Crank

So that was cinematic that the gang violence and inbred fighting to get to be the boss or die trying. No one got hurt who didn't deserve to get hurt.

The movie began in a high tempo and you got in that extreme speed mood already from the start, and the movie just escalates all through the entire movie getting more violent and aggressive. At the beginning you get right to the main plot of the movie, he has been injected by a poison that will kill him if his heart-rate decreases to much so he have to keep a constant adrenaline to stay alive, great idea for a movie with high speed all through. The scene I liked the most is when he drives through the airport / mall with about 10 cops on his tail and still he's talking kinda calm in his cellphone with his doctor about what he should do about the poison and suddenly flips over the car, getting it to go up an escalator and as calm as he could be he climbs out of the car and jumps of at the top of the escalator.

457,leslie92,Waste of Statham's capital,3,17 September 2006,"Jason Statham fans will like this one if they are content to see more of him (literally) and don't care about much else. He does his best to save this movie but, like some of his business associates in the movie, weak story and rough camera work/editing betray him. The points I gave this movie are all for him.The camera work/editing in this movie reminded me of The Bourne Supremacy with it's rapid shifting about. I hoped it would settle down after the opening minutes, but no luck. A friend who saw the movie with me said it left her feeling nauseated. Rapid changes of angles and scenes may work to make a statement if the intent is to set the mood/tone of the movie, but this technique is best applied with a 'less is more' approach unless you want to test the audiences' capacity for motion sickness. The story editing follows where the camera work leaves off with some choppy cuts that left many depth-providing details on the floor. I would have liked more background details to REALLY dislike the bad guys, so I could enjoy their comeuppance all the more. This movie comes across like a short story stretched thinly into a 1 hour 23 minute movie.The character development was shallow at best, briefly setting up various individuals as friend or foe, and then dealing with them or dispatching them accordingly. In many ways this movie resembled a teen slasher flick, but the professional killer here is also the betrayed hero (a twist). So, if you want to see a bunch of people you barely have time to know anything about get killed - and can manage to avoid being adversely affected by the scene editing,then this one's for you.Jason Statham is one of today's best on screen action figures (whether good guy or bad), and is very capable of turning in A+ performances.
