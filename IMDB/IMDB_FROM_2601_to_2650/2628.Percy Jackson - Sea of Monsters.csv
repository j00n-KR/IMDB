0,TheLittleSongbird,In search of the golden fleece,4,7 September 2018,"Will admit to have not read the book, though have heard nothing but great things here and from friends. While it was still quite flawed, found myself enjoying the first film taking it on its own terms. An attitude adopted watching its follow up 'Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters'.A follow up that is very much inferior, with a lot of weak elements and basically a lacklustre film in general in its own way. Flaws are far more and the faults that 'Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief' had are amplified. Even those who haven't read the book will find a lot wrong here, it has been said that the film takes a lot of liberties and there is a lot left out, that was very obvious in the story execution. 'Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters' is not a waste of time and has merits, but can definitely understand the criticisms from those who disliked it and share very nearly all of them.'Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters' has some nice photography and scenery and production design that is full of atmosphere and colour. Kronos looks cool, is an imposing character and effects-wise is by far the best-faring. While not the most memorable in the world, the music score fits very well and is rousing in its own right.Stanley Tucci and Anthony Head are both solid and give by far the best performances. Nathan Fillion's cameo is amusing and Leven Ramin is the only standout of the younger cast, giving her all despite not liking her character for her treatment of Percy very much. However, Logan Lerman, who has given good performances in the past, gives a dull and here charisma-free performance and Alexandra Diddario is wooden with both a lack of emotion and charm, over-acting some scenes too. Brandon T. Jackson is saddled with the clichéd comic relief role and it's often unfunny and unnecessary. Didn't get anything out of the characters, felt very little conflict or natural bond and the development was flimsy at best.The dialogue is very forced constantly, with most of the humour falling flat due to placement and the way it's written. The story is very choppy and disjointed, with a lot of jumping about, lack of cohesive flow and it does give the sense of being cobbled together. There's very little imagination, no surprises and not much at stake, it's not hard to figure out how things are going to happen. It is further hurt by all over the place pacing, some of it draggy due to some drawn out scenes and others that felt like filler and other parts rushed with an anaemic and hastily thrown together climax. Similarly wildly variable are the effects, a few decent ones especially Kronos but others are laughably bad like the water effects and the fleece itself. The action is unexciting, lacks tension and suspense and has no wonder.Overall, lacklustre but not a completely regrettable experience. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
1,bkoganbing,The Power of the Golden Fleece,8,23 August 2013,"Nearly all of the principal characters in the first Percy Jackson movie returned for this sequel Percy Jackson: Sea Of Monsters. The one notable exception was Pierce Brosnan and his role as a centaur is now played by Anthony Head.Young Logan Lerman has come to grips with his semi-divine nature and he now lives in the camp his mother brought him to in the first film, a place with a barrier put there by Zeus to protect the demi-gods from those on the outside who wish to do them harm. That first film taught us there were many.Now the barrier has been smashed and the tree that gave it life is dying. To save the tree and the camp Lerman goes on a quest for the legendary Golden Fleece which can heal all things. His is the second quest, another demi-god kid Leven Rambin who is most competitive with Lerman is taking her own team.And there's Jake Abel who is another demi-god kid who went over the dark side in the first film. He's back with his own agenda and it involves nothing less than destroying the community of immortals on Olympus.One new regular came on board here. I was really impressed by young Douglas Smith in his portrayal of Tyson who is a half brother to Lerman and a young cyclops. He was very charming in a goofy sort of way and proves to be valuable in the clinch.As I wrote in the first Percy Jackson film, the Lightning Thief it's good entertainment and if it gets kids interested in classical Greek history and mythology so much the better. Sea Of Monsters continues in that tradition.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
2,Leofwine_draca,CGI-enhanced hokum,4,2 November 2015,"PERCY JACKSON: SEA OF MONSTERS is a follow-up to PERCY JACKSON & THE LIGHTING THIEF, itself an adaptation of the debut novel in the popular young adult series by Rick Riordan. I mildly enjoyed the first film in the series, but this unfocused sequel is a lot worse; despite the plethora of on-screen action, not much actually seems to happen and it all rings rather false and hollow.This time, Percy and his buddies old and new find themselves embarking on a quest narrative to retrieve the Golden Fleece, of all things. There are various MacGuffins in the film, none of them particularly interesting or plausible, but what is apparent is the debt this series owes to Harry Potter. There are kids on the run, flying cars, magic sprays that change appearance, and plenty more besides. Inevitably Harry Potter got there first and did it better, leaving this all rather redundant.It doesn't help that the characterisation is kept to a bare minimum. Logan Lerman's hero is a dullish type and Alexandra Daddario struggles to shine as the token love interest. Speaking of tokenism, the comic relief black sidekick is still really clichéd and unfunny. The big guest stars have gone from the original film to be replaced by the likes of Anthony Head and Stanley Tucci, alongside a cameoing Nathan Fillion. For 90% of the running time, PERCY JACKSON: SEA OF MONSTERS consists of CGI-heavy action. Some of the effects are pretty good but as is generally the case with such films, it becomes tiresome very quickly.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
3,SnoopyStyle,Youth action shading towards kiddie comedy,7,10 February 2014,"Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) and his friends are enjoying life in the sanctuary. However Luke (Jake Abel) returns after surviving his battle with Percy in the last movie, and poisons the tree that protects the sanctuary. A quest to the Sea of Monsters is needed to retrieve the Golden Fleece to revive the tree. Competitive Clarisse (Leven Rambin) daughter of Aries is given the quest. However, Percy and his friends (Brandon T. Jackson, Alexandra Daddario) as well as his newly discovered cyclops half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith) decide to go on their own quest for the Fleece.I understand the complaints of the critics that this is a lesser superhero fare. When the world is full of realism Batman/Superman and blockbuster Ironman, the CGI here looks lesser and cheesier. This is less realistic taking a lot of 'Harry Potter' DNA to build a mix of funny and action. Logan has fully embraced his Harry Potter, and Alexandra is turning into Hermione. The new half-brother is Ron. I like Leven's energy injection. It is a little bit disappointing to lose Brandon for much of the middle.They are definitely going for a lot of comedy in this one. The new director Thor Freudenthal probably had a lot to do with that being more used to kiddie comedies. Nathan Fillion snags a funny cameo as Hermes who complains about canceled TV shows. And I think the young actors are gelling a lot better and having more fun this time around.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
4,Prismark10,Percy Bland,5,20 October 2014,"We return to the world of demigods who are the offspring of gods and humans. Pierce Brosnan baled out of this film (his character is replaced by Tony Head) but Logan Lerman returns as Percy Jackson, the demigod son of Poseidon. This time he is joined by a half brother, a cyclops.Camp Half-Blood the demigods training facility is at risk and our protagonists need the Golden Fleece which is located on an island in the Sea of Monsters.The film is an appropriate follow on from the first Percy Jackson film, there are some nice special effects, nice humour and its nicely paced and although the films would love to be the next Harry Potter franchise its nice entertainment for kids but nothing that breaks through the niceness. Straightforward storytelling that aims for nothing higher.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
5,claudio_carvalho,We Make Our Own Destiny,6,8 December 2013,"The Camp Half-Blood is protected by Thalia, a daughter of Zeus that sacrificed her life to save the young Annabeth, Grover and Luke from an attack of Cyclops and was transformed by her father into a magical tree. Out of the blue, Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) is visited by his unknown half- brother Cyclops Tyson (Douglas Smith) and they discover that Thalia was poisoned and is dying. Then the camp is attacked by a Colchis Bull but it is vanquished by Percy. Soon he learns that Luke (Jake Abel) is the one that has poisoned the magical tree. Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) discovers the mystic Golden Fleece is capable to heal Thalia and save their camp. But Mr. D (Stanley Tucci) assigns the winner demigod Clarisse (Leven Rambin) to the quest of retrieving the magic fleece. However Percy Jackson, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson decide to follow an ancient prophecy and they go to the dangerous journey to the Sea of Monsters to recover the Golden Fleece from Luke that wants to revive the evil Kronos to destroy the Olympus. ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" is a reasonable infantile adventure of the demigod son of Poseidon Percy Jackson. The beautiful Clarisse is an unpleasant character and Percy Jackson is a weak hero; Tyson is too dumb and Grover is funny but coward. Therefore the only attractive character is Annabeth, gorgeous and strong. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Percy Jackson e o Mar de Monstros"" (""Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters"")",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
6,nogodnomasters,YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON FAMILY,10,27 May 2019,"This is a story about special children growing up with absentee fathers who attempt to win their children's love with gifts while being worshiped as gods. In this installment Percy (Logan Lerman) and his friends go after an old sheep skin in order to save a tree. Meanwhile, bad guy Luke (Jake Abel) wants the fleece so he can revive his ancestor, Cronus known for eating his own young. Guess how that works out.The film opens with a slight monologue to reintroduce the characters. Like the Potter series, the main character's acting in the low point. This film also has that hidden world within our own world aspect. The scenes boasts wonderful special effects. The individual scenes are more overpowering than the general plot designed to appeal to the pop culture youth. Leven Rambin was made up to look like Jennifer Lawrence running around with a bow. One can't help but draw to mind the block buster films of ""Hunger Games"" and ""Potter.""This series seems designed for those slightly younger than the Potter crowd. The characters and plot lack the complexity and certainly less occult darkness.A great film for the family to see, especially the older kids who aren't prone to nightmares. Contains a family message as Percy must learn to live with a half brother who is a cyclops.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
7,kosmasp,Is this finally the end of it?,5,23 May 2014,"Science Fiction movies that are good are rare. Those who aim for a broad audience and achieve that while being of a good quality are even rarer. And while this is one iota above the first one, it just isn't good enough. We get new characters and new actors in it, along the ""old"" cast, but it feels more or less the same.One Taxi ride seems/looks awesome effect wise. The jokes being made while doing that ride? Not that good unfortunately. Nathan Fillion gets jokes even he seems to be struggling with, just because they are not funny. There is an occasional flurry that makes its way up to the surface (no pun intended), but the movie never fully lives up to its title ... another misstep",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
8,jboothmillard,Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,3,15 May 2020,"I enjoyed the first film, The Lightning Thief, it was almost inevitable that there may be a sequel, and so one followed three years later, I noticed it wasn't well rated by critics, but I wanted to form my own opinion, directed by Thor Freudenthal (Hotel for Dogs, Diary of a Wimpy Kid). Basically, it opens with the story of Thalia Grace, the demigod daughter of Zeus (Sean Bean), and her sacrifice. A young Annabeth (Alisha Newton), Luke (Samuel Braun), Grover (Bjorn Yearwood) and Thalia (Katelyn Mager) are running to Camp Half-Blood while being pursued by monsters. Thalia sacrifices herself, allowing the others into the camp, and her father Zeus turns her into a tree which creates a barrier around it. Back in the present, following his quest for Zeus's bolt, Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman), the demigod son of Poseidon, is living at the Camp Half-Blood. He is called a one-quest wonder by camp bully, Clarisse La Rue (Leven Rambin), the demigod daughter of Ares, but he has support from Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), the demigod daughter of Athena, and Grover (Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son's Brandon T. Jackson), a satyr and keeper. One day, a cyclops named Tyson (Douglas Smith) enters the camp, revealed as a son of Poseidon, and therefore, Percy's brother. After defeating a Colchis bull that managed to pass through the protective barrier and attacks the campers, they realise that Thalia's tree has been poisoned by Luke Castellan (Jake Abel), the demigod son of Hermes, and the camp is vulnerable to attacks. Percy visits the Oracle of Delphi (voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo), who tells him of a prophecy of a half-blood of the eldest gods either saving or destroying Olympus. Chiron (Anthony Head, replacing Pierce Brosnan), the activities director, a centaur, and the immortal son of Kronos, tells Percy that he is the only living, human half-blood of the eldest gods, so the Prophecy may refer to him. Annabeth and Grover learn about the Golden Fleece, which has the power to heal anything, and propose a quest to retrieve the Fleece and use it to heal Thalia's tree. Mr. D chooses Clarisse to lead the quest, much to Annabeth's and Percy's dismay. at Camp Half Blood. Much to Annabeth's and Percy's dismay, Dionysus ""Mr. D"" (Stanley Tucci), the god of wine, celebrations, ecstasy, and theatre and director of the camp, chooses Clarisse to lead the quest. Percy convinces Grover and Annabeth to accompany him on the quest, and Tyson joins them. Annabeth hails the Chariot of Damnation (a New York City cab), and Percy threatens the three drivers, the Graeae sisters (Mary Birdsong, Yvette Nicole Brown and Missi Pyle), who share an eye together, to tell him of his prophecy. The sisters give him coordinates for the ""Sea of Monsters"", aka the Bermuda Triangle, before ejecting the group from the cab in Washington D.C. While walking down the street, Grover is kidnapped by Chris Rodriguez (Grey Damon) and taken to Luke. With the help of Hermes (Nathan Fillion, replacing Dylan Neal), Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson locate Luke, then ride a Hippokampos to his yacht, the Andromeda. Luke reveals his plan to revive Kronos using the Fleece so Olympus will be destroyed. The group are locked in the brig, but they scape when Percy uses his ability to manipulate water. The group is consumed by Charybdis, and they discover Clarisse in the monster's stomach. After defeating the monster, Percy and Clarisse escape and arrive at Circeland, the lair of Polyphemus (Robert Maillet, voiced by Ron Perlman), the one-eyed giant son of Poseidon and Thoosa. Percy finds Grover, and the five escape Polyphemus, retrieving the fleece and trapping him in his cave. Afterwards, Percy refuses Luke's demands for the fleece. Luke shoots a crossbow bolt at Percy, but Tyson takes the bolt in the chest and falls into the water below. Luke places the fleece on the sarcophagus to revive Kronos. The team escapes captivity, and Percy grapples with Luke over the Fleece, as was prophesised, but Luke easily gains the upper hand. Luke is suddenly thrown away by Tyson, revealed to have survived being healed by the healing power of the water, being the son of Poseidon. Kronos rises from the sarcophagus and consumes Luke and Grover before battling Percy. He recognises the ""cursed blade"" of the prophecy and slices Kronos into pieces, imprisoning the monster in the sarcophagus once again, and it regurgitates Grover and Luke. Their victory is short lived as Annabeth is stabbed by the Manticore (Daniel Cudmore), who is killed in turn by Clarisse and Grover. Annabeth dies in Percy's arms but is resurrected by the Fleece. They return to Camp Half-Blood and Clarisse places the fleece on Thalia's tree. The group returns the next day to find the tree has been revived, but also that Thalia (Paloma Kwiatkowski) has brought back to life in human form. Percy realises that Thalia, as the daughter of Zeus, may be part of the prophecy to either preserve or destroy Olympus. It ends showing Kronos's sarcophagus glowing, implying that the monster may return. With the voices of Octavia Spencer as Martha and Craig Robinson as George. The returning cast are reasonable, it was a mistake replacing some of them, the first film was an underrated gem, this sequel has nowhere near the same quality, the story is alright, not very engaging, only the special effects to create the creatures, battles and chases are any good, overall it is a dull fantasy adventure. Adequate!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
9,BA_Harrison,I hear it's not as good as the book.,4,4 January 2014,"'It's not as good as the book', my daughter announced while we were watching Sea of Monsters; I've not read any of Rick Riordan's hugely popular novels, but I'm inclined to believe her, the film being yet another in a long line of noisy, charmless, action-packed family blockbusters that dispenses with decent story-telling, considered pacing and strong characterisation in favour of overblown CGI spectacle.From start to finish, this sequel to 2010's The Lightning Thief (which I haven't seen yet, although I doubt that makes much of a difference) is little more than a maelstrom of state-of-the-art special effects into which the book's seemingly complex plot has been messily shoe-horned (along with some truly cringe-worthy 'comedy'). While certain scenes are undeniably visually and technically impressive, the movie as a whole is a loud, often irritating and ultimately forgettable affair.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
10,CinemaSerf,"Enjoyable, if inferior, sequel - but let's not have a third....",6,27 February 2020,"I did enjoy the first film; this, however, is a poor sequel. This time our trio are sent off in search of the golden fleece so as to try and revive the tree that protects their demi-godly haven from a poison that will kill it and remove their camp's protective barrier. Lerman, Daddario & Jackson resume their roles, and Jake Abel is our mischievous baddie (we have lost the all-star nature of the first film, now), but the script and story are nowhere near as good as in the first outing. Douglas Smith does, to his credit, play the hapless cyclops ""Tyson"" quiet well, but sadly that just adds to the irritation as we seem to take forever to find the fleece. All of that said, I still enjoyed it - I liked the mythology theme and there are some good SFX - especially towards the end. It's a kids movie, and not half-bad at that.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
11,neil-476,More of the same,7,9 August 2013,"Percy (Logan Lerman), now completely at home at Camp Halfblood, goes on another quest with chums Grover (Brandon T Jackson) the faun (sorry, satyr, apparently mispronounced ""saydr""), and startlingly blue-eyed Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), this time to find the Golden Fleece. This time they are not the only ones looking for it, oh no, and they are accompanied by Percy's new mysterious half-brother, cyclops Tyson.This is light-hearted fun, similar to its predecessor, in the Harryhausen crossed with Harry Potter mould. One other cast member from the first movie joins the three returning friends, but Anthony (Buffy's Giles) Head replaces Pierce Brosnan as dodgy-CGI'd centaur Chiron.The story is slight, the script is functional but doesn't sparkle, the special effects are mostly OK, Stanley Tucci is funny but wasted, and the acting is adequate (we know that Lerman can be very good, but this doesn't stretch him in the acting department although it possibly inflicts some bruises on him). The 3D is utterly worthless.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
12,phd_travel,Cute and fun for younger audiences,7,13 September 2013,It's refreshing to see a relatively non violent adventure fantasy suitable for younger audiences again. Yet older audiences can enjoy it too. I actually prefer the story to the Hunger Games stories with all the killing. The effects and creatures are slightly fake and unreal looking but it adds to the charm. Cute blending of mythology and the present story. Logan Lerman still looks young enough for the role but Alexandra Daddario is looking a bit older.I remember enjoying the first one slightly more with the novelty of the characters but this one is alright enough.,Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
13,Hellmant,Logan Lerman has a big future ahead of him!,5,21 November 2013,"'PERCY JACKSON: SEA OF MONSTERS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The second film in the 'PERCY JACKSON' film franchise (after 2010's 'PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF') based on the books by Rick Riordan. Logan Lerman once again plays the title role and actors Brandon T. Jackson, Alexandra Daddario, and Jake Abel all reprise their roles as well. Thor Freudenthal took over directing duties (from Chris Columbus) and Marc Guggenheim wrote the script. This chapter has Percy and his friends entering the Sea of Monsters in order to find the Golden Fleece and save a dying magical tree that defends their home from outsiders. Story and dialogue are not these films' strong points but the visuals and cast are all once again impressive.The film begins with a flashback explaining how a young half-blood named Thalia (Katelyn Mager) once sacrificed herself to protect her friends, including Percy, from monsters. She was then transformed into a magical tree that protects the half-bloods' home from intruders. One such intruder breaks the force field though and poisons the tree. It's then up to Percy (Lerman), Annabeth (Daddario) and Grover (Jackson) to find the Golden Fleece in order to save the ailing plant. They're aided by Percy's newly discovered half-brother, a cyclops named Tyson (Douglas Smith), and Percy's rival Clarisse (Leven Rambin).I wasn't a fan of the first movie and found this one to be about the same (in quality and entertainment value) but I am a fan of Logan Lerman. I think he's a great young leading man and has a big future ahead of him (he's actually way too good for movies like this but he was fantastic in 'STUCK IN LOVE' and 'THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER'). The rest of the cast is decent enough as well and there's a great extended cameo by Nathan Fillion. The effects are decent but the action scenes are uninvolving, the story is boring and the dialogue is just plain bad. I'm sure fans of the film franchise and possibly the books might like it but for everyone else it's mostly a waste.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
14,Robert_duder,"Better than the first for the most part, enjoyable, fun and simple",7,17 August 2013,"I waited a long time to finally watch the first Percy Jackson and I got the opportunity to watch the first one right before going into the second so I could really compare the two. I thought there were a few fatal flaws in the first one including some really campy dialogue and performances and a story that felt a little rushed at times. It was still fun and a great adventure so I had modest expectations for this second one. It absolutely met my expectations and I think in many ways exceeded the first!! Sea of Monsters focused far more on our three heroes with the addition of some new characters which was a wise decision. There was virtually no poorly delivered dialogue because they got rid of the adult culprits that felt so out of place in the first one. This is truly about Percy finding his way as a demigod. The special effects were good in this as they were in the first but I will give the winning points in that department to the first film. That might be due to Chris Columbus having directed the first film because he certainly knows his way around epic special effects and fantasy. The effects were still good in this one, great in some scenes, but not as prolific as the first film.Logan Lerman returns as Percy. He is great in the role and has a ton of chemistry on screen and absolutely keeps you interested in his demigod hero. It was nice that there wasn't as many plot holes with his character as there was in the first film because now we can accept that he has had time to train and learn about his abilities instead of just suddenly knowing exactly what he can do. Alexandra Daddario also returns as Annabeth. She is good and her and Lerman work well together (although where's the romance angle? I expected more in that way.) However, my complaint with her character is the same as it was in the first...she doesn't get enough scenes to really show off her ability. I want to see her sword fight or just be a really strong heroine and she doesn't get to do that though I have no doubt she could pull it off. She's just underused in this sequel and the first film. Brandon T. Jackson also returns as comic relief Grover. I found him a little more fun in this one though used less. His character is very predictable and stereotypical but he works well for comedy purposes and the ""best friend"" role. He does get some more action scenes this time around so that was good. Douglas Smith joins the cast as Tyson, Percy's half brother. It was a great addition to the story because it added some depth and emotion to the characters especially towards the end and added a layer of moral message for the younger crowd and the older for that matter. Smith is good in the role, and just a little bit cheesy but that's almost necessary. Leven Rambin is also new to the cast as an adversarial ally for Percy. She's good and fun and gets some solid action scenes. Anthony Head and Stanley Tucci were terrific in their little cameos as Chiron and Mr. D. Unlike the first film neither one were campy or delivered poor lines. Head was a great replacement for Brosnan in the first film. Jake Abel also returns in his role as Luke, our villain so to speak. He is as good as he was the first time around and a worthy young villain.New director Thor Freudenthal (Thor!?! Talk about irony) takes over the helm. He does a good job and has big shoes to fill after Columbus did the first one but he made a film as good, if not slightly better so bravo to him. The characters felt more lively and important. The biggest thing I was waiting for was the rebirth of Chronos, I thought that would be amazing to see and it was!! The special effects on Chronos were very impressive and although I thought he went down a little easy, the build up and fight was good enough that it didn't bother me a lot. I'm not sure we'll ever see a third instalment which is a shame because while this is nowhere near the quality and depth of Harry Potter it is still a solid, fun fantasy adventure that entertains. Both films are absolutely worth checking out. 7.5/10",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
15,g-bodyl,Decent Fun!,8,14 November 2014,"The sequel to 2010's Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief has finally arrived and just like the first film, it offers a fun time amongst the world of Greek mythology. The Sea of Monsters continues the adventures of Percy Jackson and his friends and it was fun to watch in the process. Just like the first film, it doesn't follow the book too much closely. But does it really matter? The CGI is okay, the action is great, comedy is decent, and the screenplay leaves something to be desired.Thor Freudenthal, who takes the reins from Chris Columbus, has Percy back at Camp Half-Blood thinking if he is a one-time wonder, but the chance comes along when the mystical tree guarding the camps begins to die. Percy, Grover, and Annabeth must travel across the Sea of Monsters in order to steal the Golden Fleece from Polyphemus, the famed Cyclops. With the fleece, they will be able to restore this ""tree"" whom happens to be Thalia, daughter of Zeus.The acting is pretty good. The film doesn't have much as a stacked cast as the first film, but this cast holds it own. Logan Lerman is great as Percy and same can be said for Brandon T. Jackson and Alexandria Daddario in their respective roles of Grover and Annabeth. Stanley Tucci is excellent as the god of wine, Dionysus. Anthony Head is good as Pierce Brosnan's replacement as Chiron. Finally, Leven Rambin is a good pick-up as Clarisse, the tough warrior girl.Overall, Sea of Monsters is relatively on par with the previous film. It's not going to light the world on fire by being the greatest fantasy film ever, but it does a good job in being entertaining and often funny. There is quite a bit of action to be had and I may be biased towards this film because I will love any film with elements of Greek mythology. It's not the best written film and it could have stayed closer to the source material, but there's no complaining about that now. I rate this film 8/10.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

17,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,5,31 December 2013,"Percy Jackson: Sea of MonstersThe upside to learning you're half Greek God is that you can finally marry that bull without it being considered all weird.Mind you, it's not a bovine the demigods in this action movie are seeking - it's a ram's fleece.When the force field protecting Camp Half-Blood from mythological monsters is poisoned, camp director Dionysus (Stanley Tucci) dispatches the half-blood daughter of Aries (Leven Rambin) to go to the Sea of Monsters and claim the healing fleece for the camp.Meanwhile, Percy (Logan Lerman), Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and Percy's Cyclops half- brother (Douglas Smith) set out to stop Hermes's son (Jake Abel) from resurrecting Kronos.While the script's littered with ""fake deaths"", this second installment in the Teen Lit series has some nice subversive notes, along with a clever nod to the Fates, making it sufficient teen entertainment.However, the downside to being a teenage demigod is the Titan-sized zits.

18,Reno-Rangan,Once again demigods fight to survive against rising evil force,6,3 January 2014,"I never liked either movie from 'Percy Jackson' duology. If it was released 20 years ago it would be considered a good movie but now it is children movie like 'Narnia' series. I am not denying anything about graphics, it was good though but the movie has not pleased me hence I decided to put into an average or below list.There's noting much special about the movie to praise. As usual the young team of demigods who are select begin quest to save their kind from rise of an evil force. So the path they choose to accomplish the mission will get affected by the obstacles which they must face. With all these troubles, takes them to the grand ending where the final exciting visual fx feast comes in a quite nice show.Like the first one, I already forgot once I finished watching it. So won't remember much to tell about it, decided to conclude my review of it here itself, right now...! That's it then!!!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
19,pennyelenabooks,a sea of monsters all right,5,7 June 2014,"Percy Jackson along with Annabeth, Grover and his brother Tyson, set once again on a quest to save camp half blood this time, by bringing back the golden fleece from the sea of monsters, the only thing that can heal the tree of Thalia, which was poisoned by Luke, Percy's old enemy. Some things to consider about the movie: -Do NOT read the book first, or the books in any case. This movie is based on the second Percy Jackson book, but only at some points. Mainly its a mixture of the whole book series with some additions. So the fans of the book won't be satisfied, or happy. -Do not expect great graphics. I mean, there was a good amount of effort and the viewer can see that, but the special effects are so-so, a little bit fake. So a 3D version is recommended. -Do not expect it to be like the first one. There are some entertaining scenes all right, some funny lines, some action, but the music, the performances, the whole atmosphere is not like the lighting thief. -Finally even though the film has a good story line, at the end, it is presented the possibility of a sequel. -Oh, and one more thing, some of the actors are not the same as the first movie. So, having all that in mind, The sea of monsters is great at the beginning, but it takes a huge free fall from the middle and up until the end. The costumes and make up are good, the scenery and the set also, but those are the things that you notice when everything else fell to entertain you. Well, that's why I give the second Percy Jackson 5 out of 10, mainly because I had bigger expectations considering the first film, and because it doesn't help having read the books some years ago.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
20,leonblackwood,Over dramatic! 3/10,3,9 February 2014,"Review: They should rename this movie to Corny Jackson. In other words, I really didn't think that much about this movie. From the first one, I though that the leading character was a bit boring and a drag to watch, so this one wasn't that much better. The director just seemed to over dramatise everything and some of the scenes were just ridiculous. When Percy started to ride the waves, I thought to myself, this is just gone to far. The acting from all of the cast was pretty hard to watch and the storyline wasn't anything amazing. In all, I'm not rushing to see the 3rd instalment in this terrible franchise. Disappointing! Round-Up: If they do come out with a 3rd movie, they really do need some top actors for it to be taken seriously. On the plus side, some of the CGI wasn't bad and the introduction of the one eyed brother helped the movie along, but I still struggled to stay awake. Judging by the money that the movie made, it's obviously the hype and the fans of the books that's making this franchise stay alive, but that doesn't mean that it's going to become the next Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.Budget: $90million Worldwide Gross: $200millionI recommend this movie to people who are fans of the Percy Jackson books and the movie franchise, but don't expect anything amazing. 3/10",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
21,BeneCumb,Unsophisticated modernization of Ancient myths,6,2 December 2013,"Some decades ago, with apparent loss of interest in ancient and medieval history by younger generations, some (screen)writers started to combine modern life and habits with historic ones, some old writings were brought into contemporary world etc. Rick Jourdan is one of them, and the movie in question is based on his 2nd book of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series (screenplay by Marc Guggenheim). With some real historic names and beliefs included, we enter the world of total mess of past and present, with politically correct approaches and characters, use of modern technology in mythical stories and multiple digital effects (some successful, the others not so much). The pace is uneven, most of scenes predictable, performances and not more than decent (even Logan Lerman and Stanley Tucci are not up to their scratch).Still, the movie obtained lots of viewers and strong box office, meaning that the number of (younger) people fond of shallow entertainment and ""cute"" characters is large (bearing also in mind Thor series, for example). As for similar movies - young people combating evil and saving the world - Harry Potter series is definitely more valuable.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
22,stevendbeard,Greek Mythology For Pre-teens,6,9 August 2013,"I saw ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"", starring Logan Lerman-The Three Musketeers-2011, The Butterfly Effect; Alexandra Daddario-Texas Chainsaw 3D-2013, Hall Pass; Jake Abel-I Am Number Four, The Lovely Bones and Leven Rambin-The Hunger Games, Grey's Anatomy-t.v. and FYI: she was born in Houston, Texas and her father founded the campaign, 'Keep Houston Beautiful'. This is the second of a trilogy that is based on a series of books that are aimed at pre-teens. They remind me a little of how the Harry Potter movies were aimed at a younger audience too, but they were still good enough for older patrons. Anyway, this one has the same idea of using cameos for the adult roles-I remember seeing Stanley Tucci, Nathan Fillion and Anthony Head, just to name a few. Logan, the half-blood son of Poseidon, Greek God of mythology, is once again on a quest. Oh yeah, he is called a half-blood because his father was a God but his mother was a human. Alexandra and Leven are also half-bloods that help out on their journey to acquire the Golden Fleece that is needed to save Olympus and Jake is a half-blood that has turned to the dark side-he is a bad guy that has other reasons to get his hands on the Golden Fleece. The sea of monsters in the title of the movie refers to the Burmuda Triangle, which is where the Golden Fleece is located. It's rated ""PG"" for mild violence and mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. It was a nice little adventure and I would probably buy it on DVD.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

No wonder Pierce Brosnan as Headmaster Chiron has bailed on this pale imitation of a movie franchise already, whereas Hogwart's original chief loved his school so much he had to be carried out feet first! If you had your choice of sending your kid to school at a large castle full of adventure, protected by secret charms, or to a log fort, full of fighting Robin Hood-style, protected by secret charms, would it really be that difficult of a decision? Plus, where is the outrage from the people of Greece, to have their religion trampled on merely in a grasp for box office bucks? If they only had the money, they probably would have sent a fleet after us by now. If some country had the Holy Trinity constantly engaged in murderous back-stabbing on the big screen in a crass attempt to make a profit, you can bet the Fundamentalists who run America's military academies would find some ""yellow cake"" exports from Niger pronto to justify U.S. retaliation!

24,davispittman,Nowhere near as good as the first,1,30 March 2017,"This Percy Jackson sequel is just bad bad bad. I actually really enjoyed the first Percy Jackson movie, but this one is just misguided at every turn. I like Logan Lerman and it's not that he did a horrible job in this movie, it's just that his character hasn't changed any and it's become boring, his performance isn't necessarily bad, it's just dull and uninteresting. But Logan Lerman's performance is exciting compared to the rest of the movie, I could forgive a somewhat dull performance if the rest of the movie was good..... but it's not. The writing and the plot is very boring and doll and it doesn't do anything to keep your attention. That is this film is number one problem, it simply doesn't keep the audiences attention. The action sequences are pretty average and really aren't that cool, The special effects are just subpar, nothing all that spectacular. This movie looked exciting and adventurous to me, but the adventure is just in short supply. This was a very big wasted opportunity, because they could've done so much more with the plot. I thought the first movie was interesting and I liked a lot of things about it, but they just went a completely different direction with the sequel, and it's a dull one that almost lulled me to sleep. I completely suggest the first Percy Jackson movie, but I suggest skipping on this sequel, it's not worth your time. 1/10.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
25,3xHCCH,Entertaining Tale of Demigods and the Golden Fleece,7,9 August 2013,"This second installment of the Percy Jackson franchise begins with the story of how the sacrifice of Thalia, demigod daughter of Zeus gave rise to an enchanted tree which provided a protective shield over Camp Halfblood. When enemies poison this tree, our demigod hero Percy and his close friends, fellow demigod Annabeth and satyr Grover, embark on a quest to find the Golden Fleece in order to use its healing powers to heal the tree and restore its shield as soon as possible. Along with them in this quest is Clarisse, demigod daughter of Ares, and Tyson, the gentle cyclops half-brother of Percy. This adventure not only bring them to Circe's island in the Sea of Monsters, where the Golden Fleece was protected by the vicious cyclops Polyphemus, it will also bring them face to face with the ultimate Titan, Kronos himself, who has been resurrected from the depths of Tartarus by his misguided minions.I really liked the fluid way the story telling in this film flowed. Even young audiences can easily follow the story. However, there are a few head-scratchers may arise when you look back in retrospect, but they did not diminish my enjoyment at all. Audiences who have not read the book will probably enjoy it more since they go in without very big expectations.There are so many big computer-generated effects which looked very good, like the bronze bull that attacked Camp Half-Blood, the colorful stained-glass rendition of the big prophecy involving Percy, the gentle and graceful Hippocampus creature, the two bickering snakes on the rod on Hermes -- I thought all of these visual effects were done really well.Logan Lehrmann is really a very good young actor. He can convey his internal conflicts very well, and he can also execute some pretty intense action stunts. Alexandra Daddario is a very beautiful Annabeth, though her character in the movie sort of diminishes the strength and daring of her book character. Brandon T. Jackson plays the sidekick Grover with adeptness for physical comedy.The character of Clarisse was played by slim and pretty actress Leven Rambin. This was pretty much against the way brusque and hefty Clarisse was described in the books. Tyson was played with much charm and sensitivity by Douglas Scott, despite the rather distractingly poor way the CGI of his cyclops eye was achieved. Their camp trainers are now portrayed by new actors. The god Dionysus, lovingly called Mr. D, is now played by the ever-reliable Stanley Tucci. The centaur Chiron, previously played by Pierce Brosnan, is now portrayed by Anthony Head. They managed to be memorable despite their limited screen time.After the movie, my youngest son asked me, ""The title is ""Sea of Monsters"". But why was there only ONE sea monster?"" And as I have already read the book before, I noted that a lot of events and details described in the book had to be sacrificed or altered for the sake of streamlining this film version. Despite this, the final result is actually a neat, easy to follow, very entertaining adventure film for young and old alike. 8/10.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

29,rgkarim,"Humorous and Good Kid Fun, not much else",6,8 August 2013,"Another week, another movie, or movies I should say as four big projects release into the cinematic world. My first review opens up with the latest book based adventure Percy Jackson and The Seas of Monster. After the last film, I didn't expect to see a sequel follow as fans were not impressed with their rendition, as well as the actors were outgrowing the ages they were supposed to play. Thus, when I saw this announced I wondered what was in store. What were the results? Please read on to find out.I'll start this review by saying fans of the series need to do their best to either wipe the book from their memory temporarily or accept that they won't follow Riordan's timeline. Sea of Monsters has once diverged and become a tale of its own, altering the course Jackson very drastically. The tale of Thalia (Paloma Kwiatkowski) being revealed at the very beginning before we ever see Percy and the crew. This didn't bother me so much, but movie magic was only getting started as they turned a book that had many obstacle side trips into something much more linear. Rather than overcoming obstacles to get to the destination, which sometimes as well contains hindrances to his quest, the movie decides to only have obstacles at the destination. Where Riordan comes up with creative means to solve these problems with some suspense, the movie decides to use simplistic maneuvers (hack and slash) to solve most problems. For kids they'll love it, because it it's exciting but not too intense, while others will be like that's all to mighty terror. Other unfortunate rewrites take key aspects of the story out that developed the characters and merely combines these ploys or merely references it in a side-glance. I'm sure this is for time and budge purposes, but the purse strings need to come off a little more to get the balance right. As for the endgame, well it's very anticlimactic in my opinion, lacking intensity and merely hobbled together to get a conclusion, which hints at a third movie.Despite the plot rewrite for kids and wavering attention though, the comedy is where this movie shines. Director Thor Freudenthal and his team has injected humor into all of the characters, reflecting what the author of the series expertly did. Every character has some type of funny quality to them that made me laugh, and blended together worked well to keep the tale fun and lighthearted. Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) had the sidekick humor, making a fool of himself, shouting out an insult or two set up for jokes, and then somehow pull out a move that is impressive and yet humorous. Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) while a bit out of balance, has a few quips that are timed well to lighten the mood, though usually it's in response to Clarisse (Leven Rambin) the over competitive Ares heir. This girl again has arrogant responses, but her humor comes in her shortcomings, where other characters have to pull her out of the fire. Percy (Logan Lerman) our noble warrior even has a few well-timed lines thrown in to the mix, often a subtle phrase to sum up the feelings. Yet the humor really shines in Tyson (Douglas Smith) and Mr. D (Stanley Tucci). Tyson is sweet, big hearted, and lovable, but the team really altered his character to play a fool that somehow screws up in the funniest way. While no Steve Urkle, the sunglass wearing fool has plenty of dialog that will have you laughing, yet not cross over into the clumsy mess of annoyance that often happens in the movie. As for Mr. D., well Tucci's humor has always tickled my funny bone, as he naturally adapts into this character and puts his charm into again well-timed lines. Yet the humor could not cover up some of the other mistakes this movie has. Acting wise it's okay, but many of the characters are often too emotionally spoken out to be respected. Most of the reactions involve simply screaming, or calling for an item, and when it comes time to share inner feelings, only Smith seems to have the means to deliver it. Of course the acting/design of Luke has to be the worst, as Jake Abel seems to be an emotionless drone that just stares at the camera looking like Tom Petty. When I saw Luke in this movie, I was like oh great it's a male Bella, which doesn't make for a great character when compared to other villains. Acting isn't the only thing to take a hit, as the CGI has been sacrificed to some other plot device, most likely the 3-D editing. Many mythological forces are obviously fake, lacking any real detail, or depth to imaginary object. While some creatures that lurk in the sea do has some nice polish and glow, there are a few big story characters that look cheap, fake, and yes kiddie. I can't elaborate more for fear of ruining, but let's just say making every movie in 3-D where things pop out of you is getting old and cheesier with every attempt. Percy Jackson and The Sea of Monsters is a fun movie, and most likely will bring joy to the children it's designed for. Yet cheap tricks and creative laughs cannot save this movie from falling into the alright pile of the summer movies. Purists of the book need to avoid this like the plague, because from the very beginning you'll be screaming What the heck is this crap, from the beginning. Those with an open mind can give it a shot, but I think this film is well worth the wait of Redbox or movie channels.

30,rannynm,"Epic, Thrilling Adventure with Suspense and Comedy",10,19 December 2013,"I loved the first Percy Jackson movie, and when I heard I was reviewing the sequel I already knew what it would be an epic and thrilling adventure with a perfect mix of suspense and comedy! And I was right. ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" is a fun and mythical adventure everyone would love! I still did not expect so many surprises in this movie and greatly enjoyed it! The story continues as if it was a day or a week after the first movie which was a good perk as well. Something else that's very cool is the fact that movie is super close to the actual book! The adventure begins when Percy (Logan Lerman) is still at camp with his friends, Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario). Everything is more or less the same. There is a new girl whose name is Clarisse. (Leven Rambin) She is the daughter of a human and the god of war. This girl is beating the heck out of Percy and she's very mean as well. One day there's a bionic monster outside of the camp, thanks to one of the gods though, there is a shield reflecting the bionic nightmare, when the shield is broken they destroy the machine and Percy discovers that Luke, a villain that tried to over throw the gods, is alive! Annabeth discovers that the tree producing the shield is dying and appears to be poisoned. Annabeth, Percy, and not a very happy Grover all go on a quest to receive an artifact that can bring anything dying to life – Golden Flees! Do you believe they can restore the shield and save their camp? You would have to watch the movie!There is so much to love about this film and maybe only one or two things to dislike. It has comedy, action, adventure, mythical places and items, and so much more! The maybe one thing I thought was interesting is that Annabeth turns into a blonde in this movie. What is interesting than in both books Annabeth is a blond, but in the first movie she's not a blond, but a brunet! That was really the only thing that confused me. The director, Thor Freudenthal did a fantastic job and so did the cast. I would have to say my favorite moment in this film is when the gang calls a ""taxi"" to get them to Florida. The gang is extremely scared of the three drivers wicked driving, and it turns out that the kids don't have enough money to get to Florida! Uh oh! I would have to recommend this film to ages 10 to 18. There is very little language or any adult material at all. It may be a little scary for younger ages though.

31,Kamurai25,PJ and the Search for the Shiny Blanket,6,12 July 2020,"Good watch, might watch again, but can't recommend unless you're just a Percy Jackson fan.This movie definitely had a good budget: production quality is high, enough recognizable side characters that clearly have hefty paychecks (well, heftier than the kids), so much quality cg work that was either unnecessary because it was pointless or overly complicated.I understand that this is from a series of books, but it really felt like they lean really heavy on the idea that Percy Jackson was a ""one quest wonder"" to the point where it feels like we're watching a b plot with Jackson and Clarisse is the actual a plot. Even the end of the movie contributes to the concept.Bringing Leven Rambin (Sarah Connor Chronicles) on as Clarisse is a refreshing way to breathe life into the sequel, but she's not in the focus of the movie. Bringing Alexandra Daddario back was a good choice, but she seemed incredibly under utilized, like a worse version of Ron Weasley, just a body there, but maybe they'll kiss. Brandon T. Jackson is in and out of the movie focus, so he's only able to do so much to help the movie. Jake Abel (Hunger Games) is back, but as a villain, so while he does a decent job, it's limited.I think after the first movie, they impressed upon Logan Lerman to carry more of the weight of the movie, and let him share the load with Douglas Smith, but while they complimented each other, it's bland complimenting bland. And it's not they the did a bad job, they just didn't do the great job needed for this movie to really stand out.While I think there is an enjoyable movie here, you're not missing anything by skipping it, or re-watching the original.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
32,WeAreLive,I used some paragraphs from someone's review,6,2 August 2019,"The movie is quite action-packed and pits our hero against a variety of Greek monsters. I loved the scene where the half-bloods had to face the Colchis bull. The mechanical bull was quite extraordinary and that scene was entertaining. However, I felt that the climax was a bit of a letdown as all the tension that had been generated zipped away so quickly.Characters come and go. In ""Sea of Monsters"", much of the ensemble cast that make up the deities from the previous film are absent. We will see no more of Zeus (Sean Bean), Poseidon (Kevin McKidd), Hades (Steve Coogan), Persephone (Rosario Dawson), and Chiron (Pierce Brosnan). That means most of the experienced actors are out (not to forget Uma Thurman as Medusa). In replacement, we get Dionysus portrayed by the reliable Stanley Tucci. The gods Hermes and Chiron have replacements (Nathan Fillion and Anthony Head, respectively). We also have the clumsy but humble Tyson (Douglas Smith), Percy's cyclops half-brother, and the self-eccentric Clarisse La Rue (Leven Rambin), demigod daughter of Ares.The movie had lots of scenes involving special effects. It was okay but it wasn't excellent. Some of the creatures were stunning (the hippocampus was amazing and eye-candy) whereas some looked pretty cheap and effortless (Kronos).But hey at least we had Ron Perlman.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
33,moviexclusive,Some diverting effects-heavy setpieces and affable chemistry among the stars make for a reasonably engaging teen-centric piece of Greek mythology entertainment,6,9 August 2013,"The bestselling 'Percy Jackson' novels was essentially Greek mythology for young adults, its main characters made up of teenagers who were half-human and half-god - otherwise known as half-bloods - and received training at a special camp of the same name. Based on the second book of the series, 'Sea of Monsters' returns Logan Lerman as the titular character now fully aware of his identity as Poseidon's demigod son, and somewhat of a legend after having saved the world by returning Zeus his lightning bolt. Also returning are: Grover (Brandon T. Jackson), the mischievous satyr (half man-half goat) who is Percy's best friend and protector; Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), the daughter of Athena, daughter of Athena; and last but not least Luke, the son of Hermes and Percy's ostensibly embittered nemesis after having been exposed as the lightning thief in the first movie. They are joined by a shaggy Cyclops named Tyson (Douglas Smith), Percy's half-brother whose mother was a sea nymph (yes, we know what you're thinking - Poseidon's been going around getting some).Camp Half-Blood is once again threatened - not by any of the wrath of the gods this time, but by an unknown enemy that has poisoned the magical tree responsible for the shield protecting the camp from evil forces. The solution? Retrieve the Golden Fleece in the Sea of Monsters (more commonly referred to as the Bermuda Triangle) to save the tree - and to add a frisson of urgency, Percy and his friends have to do it before Luke uses it to resurrect the dreaded Kronos, the long-dormant leader of the Titans.In spite of the similarities one may draw between Percy and Harry Potter, the movie is no equivalent; rather, the plotting is no more than standard setup for some effects-heavy sequences and a healthy dose of tween-centric chuckle. Indeed, this is strictly PG fare from start to finish, with none of that dark stuff which gripped the last few 'Potter' movies; but even with a pre-teen template, director Thor Freudenthal (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") executes CGI and humour with enough panache to make this an entertaining diversion. Milking the most out of his mid-sized budget, Thor stages a number of impressive set-pieces, including a voyage through the stomach of a vast sea monster Charybdis that leads up to a climactic battle with the revived Kronos in an abandoned amusement park. But the best of them all turns out to be a high-speed cross-country ride that Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Tyson hitch in a New York City cab driven by the grotesque- looking Gray Sisters trio (Mary Birdsong, Yvette Nicole Brown and Missi Pyle) whose squabbling over a lone eyeball resembles something out of a Tim Burton movie.It's a pity the rest of the movie scripted by Marc Guggenheim doesn't begin to approach the inspired lunacy of this one sequence, even though the banter between the teen stars - including the hyper-competitive Clarisse (Leven Rambin), daughter of war god Ares - as well as the supporting adult characters is affably engaging. In particular, Freudenthal gets considerable mileage out of Nathan Fillon playing Hermes as a UPS worker and Stanley Tucci as Camp Half-Blood's primary caretaker Dionysus - though both can hardly make up for the loss of Pierce Brosnan, Sean Bean, Catherine Keener, Uma Thurman and Ray Winstone from the first movie.Yet the brisk pace means it's easy for an undemanding audience to overlook these flaws and simply be immersed in its teen-friendly imagining of mythology. Like its predecessor, this sequel is a movie that you'll find reasonably enjoyable if you accept it on its own terms - and to do so, means understanding that this is constructed as an adolescent fantasy and no more. On that basis alone, 'Sea of Monsters' is good fun and harmless summer popcorn entertainment.www.moviexclusive.com",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

I assume that the author is either British or Australian. This series plays in the spirit of the Harry Potter Series, but doesn't quite live up to its expectations. The special effects are extraordinary. Especially the water horse! The Greek influence is fun. (UPS is run by Hermes!) The plot has been simplified for the screenplay, and it dilutes the whole thing. Why and how does the Cyclops have ownership of the Golden Fleece? I thought it was in the Garden of one of the Gods. Where is Half-Breed Summer Camp, exactly? Do they ever live anywhere else? Fun to-be-sure, but missing that ""spark"". Maybe a better setting? The primal forest isn't exactly ""Hogworts""! The heroine is spellbinding. She has far more charisma than poor Percy!

35,RNMorton,A Story without a Soul,6,8 September 2013,"Heavy spoiler ahead. I'm not a professional movie or literature critic. I don't really think in the abstract of ""character development"" or other cinematic terms of art. But I know that for me there was something essential missing in this movie. To hit the high points - all the characters including Percy are well if somewhat superficially played, with the exception of course of Tucci, a perfect cast for Dionysus who seems to have found a niche in recent fantasy/sci-fi films. The special effects are pretty good, closer to overwhelming/unbelievable than necessary but better than say Transformers. And the story doesn't drag, it moves around enough to keep you semi-interested. The problem is, I never get fully involved, for two reasons: 1) I don't understand why the characters do what they do; and 2) some of what happens just doesn't make sense (neither of which were as big a problem in the first movie, which was engaging and one or two notches above this). I'll give you one example of each. 1) I missed who Annabeth's mom was (Athena), please remind me of who Athena was and how that would impact on her behavior. Hermes says he made mistakes raising Luke - like what? Tell me something about that. The satyr - what makes him unique and how does that affect his behavior? The movie is more like this happens, then that happens, and this guy is this way and that guy is that way, then this happens, and then this happens. Tryon seems more connected to Poseidon then Percy - give me a hint why. I'm having trouble articulating this but much of what happens seems artificial and arbitrary. There's also not a lot of humor in this movie, which I think is somehow connected to point 1). Percy's lack of connection with his dad is a great great opportunity - use it! (without beating it to death) At the end of the movie, close by having Percy and Tyson go the lake, commiserate about how hard it is to feel connected to dad, and then have a bubble or something come up from the middle of the lake. How could they miss that?!? One example for point 2 - Percy pretty much single-handedly defeats the Bull - how can everyone else not know about that? How can they not congratulate him? Why would Clarisse still say he's a loser? He saved the whole group! I don't know, but it seems like there's a much better way of working with the great basic premise of the Percy Jackson franchise than this.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
36,sharky_55,Slightly better,6,26 August 2015,"Fundamentally, or at least initially, Sea of Monsters attempts to wrest back control and acknowledge its origins as a children's book and as the second entry into what Fox hoped would become a successful movie series. This one opens with a little flashback prologue establishing the origins of Camp Half Blood and its magical protection, before later delving into a gorgeous animated retelling of the overthrowing of the Titans that is visualised through a vivid and colourful stained glass mural. It is easily argued that this sequence should have began the first movie, but at least Freudenthal is aiming to rectify the mistakes of Lightning Thief. In another pleasant surprise, the gods of the movie are less doom and gloom than the first, where the gigantic figures in phony costumes were very out of place and even more distant than a parent who runs out on you. Stanley Tucci is god of wine and camp director Dionysus, his performance full of mopiness and dry humour that we've come to expect. There's also the surprisingly well done Fates in the modern taxi cab that manages to be both funny and freaky, although spouting off mysterious numbers seemed a little cheap. Nathan Fillion steals his scene as the charismatic Hermes, god of messengers and trade, neatly modernised into a shipping company where a nice transition of the frame turns a humble little posting office into a massive warehouse and his collared t-shirt into a suit. He's a little pompous, humorous, but more importantly he's good natured and adds an emotional overtone to the whole gods abandoning their children that was sorely missing in LT. Oh, and a Firefly reference. As such it means that Grover doesn't have to carry the bulk of the comic relief, and his character is more bearable for it. Annabeth is less wooden, this time having an actual sub-plot that lets Daddario inject some emotion into her thought process. Lerman as Percy is less bravado and confident than before, but it comes at the expense of hyping up Clarisse, the newcomer played by Levan Rambin. One might argue that she also should have been in LT. She's surprisingly refreshingly for a movie of this calibre; even with the rattling off her accomplishments initially, we see a little of the desperation to impress her father (god of war, Ares) and bring glory for him. The banter on the confederate ship is great, and she even shows a little more humanity and humour elsewhere: ""Uh, Tyson, let go of my hand!"" That big cyclops with a childlike demeanour is played by Douglas Smith, who manages to bring a decent level of naivety and innocence to the character. It's actually a better approach than the complete child that is in the books. And thank goodness for the mist spray; one eye just does not work in live action. For all these positives though, Sea of Monsters takes a few abrupt turns that really sabotage it's overall presentation. We have the frivolous action scene that takes place on Luke's yacht, complete with nameless henchmen with harmless weapons. It's cool to watch Percy surf off on waves but it just adds to his uneven characterisation, whereas Jake Abel manages to maintain the same indifferent monotone performance that really takes away the little drama the scene has. The final battle scene is perhaps the most aggravating. In a complete misinterpretation of the great prophecy, we get a very glorified large scale battle out of nowhere. Sure, the special effects are decent here and throughout (the bull, the hippocampus), but the character design of the major villain of the whole series is so poor and unthreatening that the whole fight is so shallow and thin. We have no idea what makes Riptide a cursed blade. We have little reason to care for Percy bounding amongst digital glowing rocks. Sea of Monsters really tries to turn the movie series into something with consequence and continuity. The final scene with Thalia hints at what still is to come. Yet that is mirrored by Luke's last scene, where we are meant to chuckle at the look on his face as he realises his dilemma with Polyphemus. That end feels more like the one of a singular film, where Luke is destined to spend the rest of his days in the cave instead of being a vital character in the overarching plot. SOM gets a lot of things right, but it gets the big climax wrong. For all its improvements on its predecessor, you would think that the series is right on track. There has been no plans to make the third movie as of now. But looking at the absurd way in which they unveiled Kronos for the first time, maybe it's for the best.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
37,phubbs,Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,3,8 December 2013,"Much better film title this time around, loving the sound of it, alas if only the film was actually as good. The franchise moves on, the next chapter adapted from the novel of the same name, basically Greek mythology set within our present day and updated.This time our young hero 'Percy' must find the Golden Fleece to heal a magical tree that protects his home of Camp Half-Blood. The fleece can be found in the lair of the Cyclops 'Polyphemus' which itself lies within the Sea of Monsters (Bermuda Triangle). So off our little intrepid adventurers go to find it and save the world as we know it...kinda. Oh and did I forget to mention there are some bad guys also trying to get the fleece to raise 'Kronos'? well there you go.In all honesty I can't really recall much about the first film, it got so easily lost in a whirlwind of Potter-mania and some other nondescript replicas, but I did seem to slightly enjoy it according to my review (yep I read em). This of course is still the main problem with this franchise and any other really...they will always be compared to the superior Harry Potter. The kid with specs set the bar high and was the first big budget fantasy of its kind to do really well. After that every else has seemed weak in comparison, merely average imitations.This film does itself no favours simply because it looks average in the special effects department, a major flaw for a fantasy. Right from the start everything just looks lame, Camp Half-Blood just looks like some kind of summer holiday Cub Scout camp where you'd eat sausage n baked beans for dinner. The big creatures are obviously CGI and boy do they look it, most of them just stand out big time, that large mechanical bull that attacks the camp is laughable. There are various other big creatures throughout that are all CGI and none look any good frankly, accept for the odd closeup perhaps. The finale with Kronos is the same, if these were video game in-game sequences I'd be impressed, but they aren't.Some sequences really do look truly awful in fact, I'm amazed they got through into the finished film!. When the young trio ride a big Seahorse thingy across the sea to reach the bad guys yacht, that is a bad one (oh and the yacht? that doesn't feel very fantasy-like does it, kinda out of place). They are riding a wet slippery sea creature at speed, yet they aren't holding on to anything, how do they stay on its back people?! plus they didn't seem all that wet afterwards. Then a bit later on in the same scene we see Percy and Luke ride/surf a big wave...don't ask it looks terrible, all the water effects look terrible.The only bit of originality to rear its head appeared to be the concept of making the three Stygian witches cab drivers in a yellow New York cab. A unique approach for sure and one that sort of works I guess...but then I realised I'd seen a similar idea before in 'Scrooged'.A common problem is the fact everything also seems so bland and derivative. All the characters are your bog standard types and offer nothing new, the hero, his sidekick, the female sidekick and the best friend who you know will get killed (and you also know will come back at the last minute). Next to that are the bog standard baddies led by the good looking charmer with blonde hair. I mean come on...at least lets try and make the characters look different from the Potter clan Jesus!. You don't care about any of them because they are all so clichéd, we've seen this all before and you know none of them will come to harm anyway so what's the point?.I guess what bothered me the most was the film was clearly trying to be epic, every scene is accompanied by a strong musical score as if that will make it so. Its not meant to be a dark emotional journey with teen angst that's for sure, its a light-hearted fantasy that doesn't show much or any death, but everything is built up to enormous proportions only to let you down. You simply can't connect with any of the characters or what's going on because the whole thing is such a basic video game with step by step action sequences. Complete one task against a CGI foe, move on to the next, complete that task against a CGI puzzle, move on to the next...and so forth.You can tell the whole franchise isn't really going as planned seeing as this is only the second film and already the cast continuity has been compromised, two major characters recast. Still I gotta give some kudos for the attempt at bringing Greek mythology into the present day even though it doesn't really work, or should that be kudos for the novel?. Plenty of good morals throughout the adventure, lots of heroic actions and bouts of friendship that will make you gag, but the entire production is predictable, anti climatic and dull. A shoddy looking sequel which fails to better the first entry.3.5/10",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
38,bettycjung,"If you like the first Percy Jackson movie, you'll probably like this one, too!",7,4 April 2018,4/3/18. It's been awhile since I saw the first Percy Jackson movie that came out in 2010! Amazing how CGI has improved since this movie came out in 2013! Still it was entertaining to watch as Lerman and Co returns for new adventures in the land of myths and monsters. The creatures were great creations and the sets were nice.,Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
39,fernandoschiavi,"Sea of Monsters is more of the same. It tells a very childish and easy-to-solve story, continuing in the same tone as the previous one",5,10 January 2021,"Despite facing criticism for the changes made in the first adaptation three years earlier, Percy Jackson is an adaptation of a literary work with many fans, and so the franchise has gained a new opportunity on the big screen. Chris Columbus would not return as a director, although he was scheduled to produce the film together with Karen Rosenfelt. In Columbus's place, Thor Freudenthal (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) was chosen. Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters arrives to give a new gas in the series, but ends up offering more of the same. It tells a very childish and easy-to-solve story, continuing in the same tone as the previous one. Although we have a smaller participation of the Gods, the main trio appears in the same dynamic seen previously. They are given a challenge and begin a journey to solve it, trying to save the world halfway. The plot may even please fans and less demanding film fans.This continuation of the less bland ""Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief"" does not require the audience to have much prior knowledge of the series of books or even the previous tape, with the script by Marc Guggenheim (""Green Lantern"") taking on the task of exposing what happened previously, with our hero being a half-blood, son of the god Poseidon with a mortal woman. The franchise's salvation, however, escapes the hands of the new director, Thor Freudenthal, and Percy Jackson and The Sea of Monsters is nothing less than the ""least worst"" in terms of quality. The adaptation just continues to unfold its flawed mythology, redistributing Ancient Greece across the map of the USA and populating it with extremely ordinary fantastic characters. Leaving the father and son order of the first film, the second chapter focuses on the bonds between brothers (blood or not) and places its title character to justify his own divinity in the fearsome Sea of Monsters, also known as the Bermuda Triangle. This time, the trio of supernatural friends led by Logan Lerman must save their precious summer camp - here, the only safe place on Earth for gods, demigods and the like is the second main American childhood archetype after school bullying.If the most attentive have already realized that the basic plot is practically the same as Fury of Titans 2 (2012) - only Zeus's son, Theseus, is replaced by Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon - Percy Jackson's biggest problem and the Mar de Monstros is not even its lack of originality, but the immense naivety of the work as a whole. The characters spend their entire time in fights and battles; however, not a single drop of blood is shed during history. Deaths are only temporary - it is a real festival of resuscitations! No dangers or really impressive threats - the villain, played by the listless Jake Abel (The Hostess, 2013), is so sleepy that all that provokes is indifference - the involvement with the audience weakens, and even the three main characters - Percy Jackson has two best friends, Annabeth and Grover - evoke the same structure seen in the Harry Potter adventures, the lack of chemistry between them and, especially, with the viewer, makes it clear that any comparison will be unfair (for newbies, of course) .Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters' first mistake (Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, 2013) was failing to maintain his cast. As much as the first film was not a masterpiece, it was at least interesting to see Sean Bean as Zeus, Pierce Brosnan as a centaur, Uma Thurman as Medusa, or Catherine Keener as a supporting figure who is not up to her talent. Perhaps it was more the pleasure of seeing other people going through awkward situations, but it was still a pleasure provided by the film. In Mar de Monsters, apart from the youth cast, no one came back.If before there was still the possible fantastical identification of following the journey of an ordinary young man who finds himself the son of one of the greatest gods of Olympus, Poseidon, this time this relationship does not exist. What happens is that we are thrown directly into the action, without further explanation or waste of time. And if this should have worked to increase the dynamism of the story, it ends up having the opposite effect, turning the whole project into a mere redundant video game, which should please - perhaps - only children and pre-teens. With so many plots and subplots to be explored in 100 minutes of projection, obviously one of the tape's major defects is its superficiality. Details that should be more shocking, like the betrayal of some half-bloods or even the relationship between Luke and his father, Hermes (Nathan Fillion), are simply thrown to the surface, with the film preferring to explore Annabeth's prejudice towards Tyson, something that will obviously be resolved in the most predictable way possible.The biggest problem for Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters is the way he treats his audience: like people without intelligence. All plot twists are perceived from miles away; like when a character is hit and falls from a canyon into a river. It would be serious if we had not already been introduced to the fact that Poseidon's children have healing power when in contact with water. Still, we went through the entire process of mourning the characters, tears and remorse. There are several moments like this that make us realize that Percy is not 12 years old, as in the original book, but they also forgot to adapt the story.Aggravating this problem of priorities, we care little about Percy himself. This is due to Logan Lerman's lack of energy or charisma. As ""The Advantages of Being Invisible"" proved, the boy is a good actor, but here he is extremely lethargic, which damages a good part of the cast, whose characters depend on interactions with the protagonist, and even our concern with the very search for the hero. And if Lerman is slow, Jake Abel's Luke is practically in a coma, with the villain not arousing anger or sympathy, just ... existing. Another one that seems not to have returned to the sequel was the personality of Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), who in the first film was a great fighter, rivaled Percy, fearless, adventurous. In Mar de Monsters, she just falls to the ground and screams for help. Unfortunately, the group's Amazon position was already filled by a new character, Clarisse (Leven Rambin). Annabeth suffers from the evil that love interest cannot be so masculine, nor compete with her man, and that seems to be her character's destiny: to be Percy's girlfriend. She was even blonde, more suitable for a damsel in distress, closer to the description of the books.And if Camp Half-Blood itself is far from being as interesting as Hogwarts in the ""Harry Potter"" saga (and the comparison here is inevitable, as well as with the sequel to the Chariot of Damnation and the Walking Nightbus of the English wizard), the universe in which the story is inserted, even punctually silly, is responsible for the best moments of the tape, such as the reverse miracle with Dionysus wine (a quick tip from Stanley Tucci) and the fact that Hermes owns UPS. Even the disguise of divine objects as products of worldly commerce is a beautiful thing. There are still some good jokes for Joss Whedon fans, like watching Anthony Head (the Giles from ""Buffy - The Vampire Slayer"") again informing a hero of a prophecy and Nathan Fillion talking about a great series canceled after one season (something which must have hurt ""Firefly"" fans), but these are too localized for a specific audience to count as a relevant point.The art direction is uninspired, especially in the camp, which is extremely bland. The creatures are just OK, as are the special effects, although both show some improvement during the very short final battle. The soundtrack, composed by Andrew Lockington, is so generic that it hurts. After all, Thor Freudenthal's slack direction, unable to get the best out of his cast, give a stronger tone to the production, give a more unique look or at least orchestrate an exciting action scene was not even the proverbial lime paddle. in this franchise that ends in a cliffhanger for a sequel that will probably never come.In the search for a differentiator, we can identify a creative approach to Greco-Roman mythology and its legends, while competitors created a vast and original world from nothing. As this is not much, the decoy ends up being the appeal of the spectacle provided by the visual effects. But this is also not entirely true. Some passages by Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters know how to use 3D resources well and bring beautiful designs, such as the ""water horse"" and the climax moment that shows a gigantic practically indestructible sea monster.For the rest, everything is quite forgettable. The characters lack charisma and reproduce archetypes already seen in North American ""high school"" films, now adapted to a camp of mythological beings and demigods. Even if it works in books, there is a lack of density for this Americanization / pasteurization of Greek mythology to be justified in cinema. Just like its predecessor, Percy Jackson and The Sea of Monsters just glue characters, curses and missions into a huddle that is suddenly hurled towards the viewer.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
40,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,PJ: SOM improves over the Lightning Thief as a more accurate adaptation for fans,8,20 August 2013,"Three years ago, 20th Century Fox made a new fantasy adventure ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"", based on the first book of the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan, that revolves around the Greek mythology set in the modern times in a Harry Potter-esque style. When it was first released in theaters, it received mixed reviews from the critics and fans were disappointed by how much the film deviated itself from the book, but it became a huge hit worldwide at the box office along with it's DVD sales. Nevertheless, a sequel was needed.When it was announced that Chris Columbus would not direct the sequel and would instead produce it, he got replaced by another director named Thor Freudenthal known for his two films ""Hotel Dogs"" and ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"", both films that also received mixed reviews. The director said that he was a fan of the book series and understood the world that he needed to fix the errors that the first film had. So, being a fan of the books and kind of loved ""The Lightning Thief"" despite it's errors, I went to see it in theaters in 3D, hoping that it would exceed my expectations. Turns out, it did and I really enjoyed it. OK, it's not an excellent film by any means, but I'll get to the flaws in a moment so I can talk about the good stuff.First, let me point out that the story is more accurate to the book than the first film. It has a nicely detailed back-story about how the Tree of Thalia is made to protect the Half-Bloods along with another back-story about Kronos done in a solid stain-glassed window sequence. There are some scenes from the book that were altered, but I actually found them to be very acceptable. It also had some of the details right including the Great Prophecy and the villain Kronos, but the only thing that I didn't like about the story was the rising of Kronos, the main villain of the book series because as it turns out he never appeared until the fourth book, ""The Battle of the Labyrinth"". I think it would improve on the future films if they get made. It also drags on a bit too fast throughout the entire film, but that's about it.There are still a lot of good things for me to talk about. The acting is once again superb. Logan Lerman did a good job as Percy Jackson as did Alexandra Daddario as Annabeth. Brandon T. Jackson is a lot more mature as Grover while retaining his comic characteristics from the first film while Jake Abel is a good secondary villain with his attempts to bring Kronos back to life. The new cast is great. Leven Rambin from ""The Hunger Games"" is a terrific bad*** Clarisse La Rue, who never appeared in the first film, Douglas Smith is very funny as Tyson, Percy Jackson's twin brother, and Anthony Head is a great replacement for Pierce Brosnan as Chiron. The two actors, Stanley Tucci and Nathan Fillon as both Dionysus and Hermes steal the show for their funny moments.The last few good things are it's beautiful scenery, the decent special effects, the heart-pounding action sequences that took every inch of my breath away, and a solid music orchestra score from Andrew Lockington.Overall, PJ: SOM is a good continuation to the franchise and improves over ""The Lightning Thief"" by fixing it's errors and turning it into a fun-filled experience for Percy Jackson fans. I simply can't wait for Titan's Curse to be made into a film as soon as possible.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
41,Christian_Dimartino,Better than I was expecting.,6,14 August 2013,"Why would they give Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief a sequel? The critics didn't exactly like it, and it didn't make that much money, and in Hollywood standards, that really isn't good enough for a sequel. But surely enough, after three years, they bring us Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters. I didn't exactly want to see it, mainly because I didn't like the first one. But I actually liked this one.We find Percy (Logan Lerman, who will most likely be playing a teenager for life) at Camp Half Blood. But the good times don't last long, because the barrier surrounding the camp is wearing off. So, Percy and his friends must embark on a quest to find the Golden Fleece, which is going to save the camp.I know that I left out a lot of plot details, but I really didn't want to ruin anything. Percy Jackson 2 is better than the original. It is at times too goofy, but it's fine for a fantasy to have a sense of humor. Look at the first three Harry Potter movies. Also, some of the lines made me roll my head and some of the visuals look a little cheesy. But this movie is fun.Some of the special effects are pretty good, and it I did laugh here and there. But it obviously comes no where near The Lord of the Rings trilogy or the Harry Potter series. Was I expecting it to? Nope. So, I can't quite call it a disappointment. But for what it is, it is a good way to kill nearly two hours. Those two hours zoom by also, which is pretty nice. I say see it.B-",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
42,Laakbaar,"This movie fell flat for me, despite the special effects",6,25 August 2013,"This franchise is based on an interpretation of ancient Greek mythology (albeit a loose, confusing and not that intelligent interpretation). The concept is intriguing.The first ""Percy Jackson"" movie was mildly entertaining. However, I didn't enjoy this second movie. It lacked intelligence and coherence (despite the quest theme). I thought it was sophomoric. It had no profundity, nothing important to say. The entire movie was essentially a parade of large, terrifying creatures, one after the next. This time around we are not even brought to Olympus.I didn't quite understand what was happening at this demigod community, and why they were subject to attack all the time. I suppose the dramatic idea is that it is a Hogwarts-like environment. After all these noisy attacks, where were the police? The media? Why did Luke attack the camp? Why had the renegade demigods gone renegade? Why were they so loyal to Luke? I think this was explained in the first movie, but I couldn't follow it this time around.The movie occasionally switched into camp or glib mode, but that didn't work for me. The Graeae cab drivers didn't work for me. The ""zombies"" on the boat didn't work for me. Tucci's character didn't work for me. This aspect dragged the movie down to the same level as ""Xena"" or the ""Hercules"" television shows.The character development was what you might see in an after-school special about high school kids trying to get along. No one ever gets hurt. It's difficult to build dramatic tension in that situation. I didn't really care what happened to them.The dialogue was dreadful. (To be fair, it is an action movie.) These demigods would not be just Americans, I assume, but I didn't hear any accents. It was all very American. It bothered me that Percy and Tyler addressed their divine (and mostly absent) father as ""Dad"". Yikes.The business with the amusement park seemed gratuitous.How terrifying can a cyclops be when it speaks like an enraged Homer Simpson? Still, the movie is not a complete write-off, despite my comments. I thought Lerman did a good job playing his role. The Tyler character was interesting. Finally, it is difficult to find fault with the incredible computer-generated images that are shown in a movie like this. The sea horse, for example.It's a fairly fast-paced movie with great special effects. The movie deserves about a 5.5 out of 10.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
43,dfa120374,Just As Average As The First Film,5,16 January 2015,"Percy and his friends, Grover and Annabeth, are back. This time they're out to recover the Golden Fleece and stop it from falling into the wrong hands. Also joining him this time is Percy's cyclops half brother, Tyson. Percy isn't the only one seeking the Fleece, though, as Luke is also trying to locate it, but Luke's plans are to use the Fleece to resurrect the Titan, Kronos. If Luke succeeds, war will rage between Kronos and the God's, bringing death and destruction to earth as well as Olympus.OK straight to the heart of the matter which is Sea of Monsters isn't really that much better than The Lightning Thief. The true star of the movie - like the 1st - is the special & visual effects and this is the only thing that IS better than the 1st film, especially Kronos. Thankfully, Kronos was done superbly and didn't have some kind of comical voice to him either. After seeing Steve ""Alan Partridge"" Coogan as Hades in the 1st film (a choice which still completely bemuses me) I was worried about who they would get to do Kronos, but worries were put aside after watching it. Kronos was done the way a Titan like him should be done - extremely imposing.I'll admit that there's a few decent comedy moments in the film too, and the action isn't too bad either. I mean it's nothing amazing, but it keeps you watching. This is obviously a family movie, but I think the people who will enjoy it most are teens aged 13 - 16, and while I know they are completely different films, Sea of Monsters unfortunately had a Twilight Saga feel to it.I've not read any of the Percy Jackson books so I can't make any comparison's between the books and the films but I can only hope that the books are better than the films. If not, then I'm not missing much with the books either.This movie is, like the first, merely just OK. If you've not seen them, then don't worry as you're not missing much. I'll stick to Clash of the Titans and Wrath of the Titans for good Greek mythology movies.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
44,billygoat1071,Glossy Mythology,5,8 August 2013,"Personally, I kind of enjoyed the first Percy Jackson movie. The tone pretty much reminiscent the eighties/nineties blockbuster, and then the likes of the big stars and the adventurous feel. Admittedly, it's still uninspired in the way it tells its story. The books, I bet, are obviously better, despite of not reading them yet. Now they continued the story in the big screen with Sea of Monsters. It's now in a whole new direction, the biggest difference is it added a lot of CGI and elevates the scale which may forget the uninspired vision of the first one, but those wonderful visuals hardly improves anything at all. The storytelling still relies on over explaining every detail the audience should know. There isn't much new about this sequel except its colors, but even all that are not enough to get this series any better.The sequel easily forgets a lot of the first film's flavor and tries to make a new one. The film is now more interested in presenting the extraordinary elements of this fantastical world, inviting us to something bigger than what we could imagine, since this is what fantasy movies usually need. But further more, it suffers in storytelling. It is once again has the characters explaining stuff throughout their adventure, even the lessons they have to learn are suddenly burst out in the third act. I think that is what they normally do, which forgets to actually develop them. The overall journey is not really that compelling. It's just going one spectacular looking place to another, giving away facts to the heroes then proceed. It feels too easy for these demigods to walk along even at the most seemingly difficult situations.Well, at least they tend to make the aesthetics look a bit better. They can still be generic, but in an eye candy way. These special effects really did a great job covering the laziness of depicting the plot, it's not much of a merit, but it's a sneaky trick the filmmakers have made. Also in the action scenes, it makes the audience think that a certain sequence is thrilling, which is actually not. The monsters are just large and scary, but there isn't enough suspense provided. The best thing I could say in this other than the visuals are the performances. The acting remains, but they are one of the charms left to keep this from being boring.Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is best at glossing things up. The effects made the film look adventurous although it's actually unexciting, and the stars' enthusiasm sort of helped these characters having some personalities than only yelling out information of the plot. In that case, the film can be mildly entertaining, but also forgettable. It's hard to say it's a completely bad film since it had some solid moments. It's a typical modern blockbuster where you will have to praise its technical achievements, performances, and nothing else. The only improvement we might've seen here is the visuals, though I hope everyone would realize that real magic is more than large scale and flashier CGI.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
45,RevRonster,This WASN'T a Direct-to-DVD sequel? Really?,6,3 December 2013,"While I enjoyed ""Sea of Monsters,"" I couldn't help but think the film could have been better. The fun atmosphere established in the first film is there but the star power isn't. Aside from Stanley Tucci and Nathan Fillion, there isn't many really big names in this film and it only works against a lot of the already established problems the movie had going for it.I'll just say it; the movie felt like a Direct-to-DVD movie and didn't have the big budget feel the first one had. Part of it is the fact it didn't have the big names attached to it like the last one did but a bigger part comes from the slightly sloppy story, some questionable special effects and Logan Lerman playing Percy like he only came back to portray the demigod because he lost a bet.That isn't to say the film is a total wash. The special effects that aren't awful are worthy of this Olympus-themed franchise, the action is fun and Nathan Fillion has a scene that just absolutely steals the film. The movie has its problems but it's still a decent, average movie that may not wholly entertain but it won't fully disappoint either.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies.

46,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,"More Sea, And Less CGI, Needed... but Still Okay",6,13 August 2013,"With all the Harry Potter films behind us, and more Middle Earth Hobbit adventures on the way, the maligned PERCY JACKSON franchise has become a cinematic underdog. The first film, PERCY JACKSON AND THE LIGHTNING Thief, centers on a group of young, misunderstood demi-gods half human, half gods at a wilderness camp protected from nefarious outside elements and, like Hogwarts in the Potter series, is a place to learn their trade Although THIEF (according to rabid fans) strayed from its source material, the movie was, for conventional viewers, breezily entertaining.Now we have a second adventure where the basic journey gets right under way But not so fast The best sequences occur in the first twenty minutes as a metallic bull invades camp and, after a terrific looking battle with sublime 3D special effects, we're introduced to a new character, a young Cyclops claiming to be Percy's brother, and a mission to find a Golden Fleece within an extremely dangerous ocean. The main problem with SEA OF MONSTERS is the modern terms and/or vocabulary invading the timeless element concerning Mythological characters. Certain phrases and jokes take the escapist factor away from the story, feeling more like a bad high school comedy than fantasy at times. And there are some really lame side-characters on board, like three blind witches straight from MACBETH driving a speeding taxi cab, trying way too hard to be fun and funky, or tiny smack-talking snakes loosely embedded on an ancient weapon, befitting a Nickelodeon kid's show or a really bad cartoon. The core of the movie occurs at sea – the title will tell you that much. There are a few slick action scenes and intriguing oceanic creatures, but the story hits a wall once the collection of heroes face off on island harboring a closed down amusement park, pitting Percy and friends against the original Lightning Thief, who again wants to rule things his way, and an angry Cyclops and eventually, The Devil (Hades) himself.While non-stop action abounds within this final thirty minutes, at this point the characters mean very little compared to the desperate need for a prolonged big budget climax.

47,p-jonsson,Good family movie but dragged down by some really stupid moments,6,24 December 2013,"This is a quite decent family movie. I have to say that, in general, I enjoyed watching it and so did the rest of the family. It is a nice young adult adventure with a nice mixture of adventure, action and funny moments.The special effects are fairly okay most of the time but, unfortunately, not all of the time. In particular, some of the water effects where not so good. The scene where the old tub they are on breaks through the water after having escaped Charybdis is especially bad.What drags the movie down are some really stupid moments. The overconfident and egoistic bitch always bullying Percy is rather tiring for example. Tyson fumbling around all the time is also not so fun and how come Tyson could stop the bull in the first couple of scenes but then seems to be unable to do pretty much anything? The worst parts are during the final battle though. When Percy rediscover Tyson and they just stand there looking at each other while Kronos is in the process of escaping. Even worse they start to hug each other instead of grabbing the bloody fleece. That scene is really an insult to the viewers intelligence and really dragged down my appreciation of this movie.Having said that, it is a decent enough family movie and the youngest of the family quite liked it.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

50,ayoreinf,"Making amends for past sins, and then committing new ones",8,16 September 2013,"Lets be honest, Thor Freudenthal the director and his script writer Marc Guggenheim, were faced with a daunting challenge. After their predecessors (Chris Colombus and Craig Titley, correspondingly) butchered the previous movie of the emerging franchise, and they were the starting team. So they were put in a bind from the very beginning, having to introduce two key factors in the movie that had to be there from the very start, the roles of Clarisse and the not less important role of Kronos, the hand pulling the strings behind Luke. Considering that predicament, they did fairly well. I mean they did introduce both of these characters, they did it very nicely with Clarisse, and were much less successful when they got to Kronos, starting with the fact that they botched the mythological background, which is a sin the original series of the books would've never commit. They did do some other serious mistakes but nothing as bad as the original team, and if they could fix the mistakes of the Colombus Titley team, maybe they can fix their own mistakes on the next production. All the rest was done as well as can be expected, the action is as one expects from the books' series which explodes with constant action. The special effects are in accord with the common standards in the industry at the moment. The acting is all right, and sometimes even above par - Tyson's role is performed superbly even though his introduction story is not exactly as the books spelled it, his character is right there in the movie and Douglas Smith has a lot to do with this fact. The bottom line is - it's a move in the right direction, but it should cover a lot more distance to reach the quality of the books' series.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
51,rgblakey,The half-blood is back with Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters,4,14 August 2013,"After Chris Columbus had launched the Harry Potter film franchise, he moved onto another young adult series in hopes to create a similar hit series with Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. The film didn't capture the popularity of Potter so everyone thought it was the end of Percy Jackson, but the son of Poseidon is back once again with Percy Jackson and the Seas of Monsters. Could this latest entry get the series the recognition it had hoped for to continue or will this be the last adventure of Jackson? Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters follow Percy and his friends as they set out on a journey to find the Golden Fleece in order to save Camp Half-Blood. The first film worked well enough, but had some slow pacing that kept it from every being the exciting film they were hoping for. With the latest entry, they have upped the action and adventure, but it lacks some of the story. Sure the film flows well enough to tell the story, but it felt rushed and thrown together at times. There are plenty of talented actors here, but sadly most of the performances seemed a bit phoned in. Since the first film Logan Lerman got critical acclaim for Perks of Being a Wallflower, but here seemed to just be going through the paces. Anthony Head of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame takes over for Pierce Brosnan and actually does a better job feeling more like he was meant for this character. Nathan Fillion is only in the film for a small amount of time but delivers his usual funny charm and even manages to throw in a Firefly cancellation reference that is really funny. The action and visuals are a lot of fun despite some of the special effects look like they are from a SyFy Channel film.This isn't a horrible film by any means, it is actually pretty fun time, but just felt at times that no one's heart was really there. When you see franchise films you want to feel the passion of those involved, but here it just wasn't there. Not sure how well this film did, but doesn't seem to be breaking the box office, but of course the first one didn't either so who knows if there will be another adventure. It would suck for the real fans if not as this one sets up for a new film, but only time will tell.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
52,kooleshwar,Seems amateurish and straight of a template....,6,28 February 2014,"The template probably read..1) Competitive girl.2) Heroes filled with self doubt.3) A twist.4) Rehash some mythical characters from the first movie.5) Add a few characters.6) Fit a script in somewhere.The GOOD part though is that the above template is enough to please most kids, young teens and adults like me with the correct expectations.Unlike Harry Potter and even the highly underrated Chronicles of Narnia this movie doesn't feel like its from a new book or even thats its part of a richer universe.The acting is pretty standard with only the characters of Clarrice and Mr.D showing any panache.Technically the movie is weak especially considering the 90 million dollar budget, someone should be checking the accounts of the special effects team.It has a few good one- liners and the bare bones script is enough to keep you interested throughout, even though it never reaches the point of making you laugh out loud or reach the edge of the seat.The movie seems more like a series of scenes stitched together but the decent qualities of the scenes ensures that you can neither be too disappointed nor too pleased with your overall experience of the movie.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
53,Mike-DD,Surprisingly Entertaining,6,14 March 2014,"Logan Lerman may not be the best actor, but like Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, you cannot imagine anyone else as Percy Jackson after the first outing.However, the most entertaining character has to be Tyson as his Cyclops half-brother. He's ""smarter"" than in the book, but he has good comic timing. It's just a pity he sees so little action.And given that this is a CG-driven movie, it is surprising what has been accomplished on a budget of $66m, even if the young actors do not demand high salaries, with the exception perhaps of Lerman. The CG effects are believable if you are willing to suspend disbelief, which you'd have to in the first place anyway.Since it is marketed towards the teen/young adult set, the lack of a ""deep"" story does not bring the movie down. In fact, it makes it an enjoyable suspend-disbelief-and-go-along-for-the-ride film outing.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
54,Jonathon_Natsis,Not your typical Greek tragedy.,7,22 May 2014,"Based on the kid's novel by Rick Riordan and directed by tween-friendly filmmaker Thor Freudenthal (Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Hotel For Dogs), Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters picks up from 2010's origin story and introduces us to a new world of half-bloods: products of their mum or dad doing the nasty in the pasty with a Greek god. Seen as outcasts in the normal world, these children have taken refuge at Camp Half-Blood, where they live in harmony under the protection of Zeus' magic dome. But when evil forces find a way to penetrate the barrier, the ambush stinks of an inside job, forcing Percy and friends to recover the mystical Golden Fleece and restore peace.The franchise loses some star power in the sequel (Sean Bean's Zeus, Steve Coogan's Hades and Uma Thurman's Medusa are all gone), but it compensates with cheeky cameos from Nathan Fillion and Stanley Tucci, on top of an unfair amount of impossibly good-looking young thespians. Tucci is particularly fun, hamming it up as Dionysus, connoisseur of fine wine/borderline alcoholic, and reluctant caretaker of Camp Half-Blood. His running feud with Zeus – who keeps using his powers to turn wine into water – delivers cheap laughs, none more so than when Dionysus threatens to turn to Christianity because ""their guy can do that in reverse.""The film isn't all cartoons and comedy, because when the series of events actually kick into gear, it develops into a pleasantly absorbing adventure. Pieced together on a spare change budget of $95 million, a series of thrilling set pieces allow the SFX department to flex their muscles. The bloodless, PG action and truckloads of CGI can only take the experience so far, but the film never feels like it's cutting corners, instead showing a del Toro-esque patience to wow the crowd while deftly keeping the novelty from wearing off.Consideration is also given to weaving in some of the finer points of Greek mythology. Anyone familiar with the quasi-religion knows it plays out as some sort of ancient Jersey Shore; a rich tapestry of backstabbing, double-crossing and one-night-stands, all arguably stemming from Zeus' inability to keep it in his pants. Again, things aren't quite that graphic, but family films have traditionally manufactured lamer villains than one who gains strength from eating his own children. Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters proves a surprisingly enjoyable romp, delivering a story naturally tailored to an established audience, but doing just enough to keep things fresh and exciting for big kids too.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
55,JPfanatic93,There's nothing divine about this one,5,23 September 2013,"Second Percy Jackson film, following the demi-decent, excessively long named Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, but being even more forgetful. This time Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman again) and his fellow friends from Camp Halfblood, where all the offspring of the gods sired on mortals are gathered for their safety, set out on a quest to find the Golden Fleece in the so-called 'Sea of Monsters', better known as the Bermuda Triangle. They do so to heal a magical tree that protects their home with a forcefield that keeps non halfbloods out, but which has been compromised since the tree is dying. The Fleece contains healing properties that might save it, and therefore, save themselves. Unfortunately a band of rogue halfbloods with sinister plans led by the same dull villain from the first film, the whiny demi-god Luke, are also seeking this magical MacGuffin so they can use it to deliver the evil god Kronos, a fiery humanoid terror, from bondage. The brave Percy and his companions, Ron and Hermione Grover the – supposedly funny – Satyr and the ""wise"" Annabeth (with racist attitudes towards Cyclopses), must beat them in a race against time across the most dangerous sea of all to defeat Kronos for once and for all. And they get no help from their divine parents, which is a shame since they were played by terrific actors you just can't get enough of (the likes of Sean Bean and Kevin McKidd) in the first film. At least we are a little compensated by the appearance of Nathan Fillion as the dashing entrepreneur Hermes, with a nod to Firefly thrown in (which totally blows over the heads of the target audience, but might make some older viewers chuckle). Like its predecessor, Sea of Monsters feels very much like the 'Greek myth' version of the first few Harry Potter films, complete with prophecies and chosen ones, magic and monsters, and a triumvirate – though of two boys and a girl, sadly lacking the necessary chemistry – of young lead characters getting entangled in one action driven situation after another. Unfortunately the movie lacks the heart and soul that increasingly drove Potter and Co., while the plot tries to keep its head above water in an ocean of gaping plot holes and overly digital FX sequences. Some of these are at least exciting to a minor extent, like the fight against a metal robot bull and the scene where the protagonists are swallowed by Charybdis (basically the Sarlacc from Return of the Jedi, except embedded in water instead of sand), but the rest of them is nothing if not boring. There's an irony in the fact that old fantasy films fondly remembered mostly for containing elaborate monster fights done in stop motion, like those of Ray Harryhausen, have stood the test of time, while their present day counterparts that try the same with CGI prove oh so forgetful and will undoubtedly end up not so universally revered in future years. If you look at the set-up of this film, a plot dealing with the resurrection of the ancient Kronos whose rise will cover the world in chaos coupled with one scene after another of the main characters fighting digital creatures, Sea of Monsters bears more than a striking resemblance to the abysmal Wrath of the Titans, which was also a lousy sequel to an already disappointing film that unsuccessfully tried to cash in on the ever ongoing public interest in Greek mythology by getting itself lost in people battling digital creatures. A shame really, since the notion of the ancient Greek world of gods and monsters continuing to simmer just under the surface of modern times but unseen by Muggles everyday humans is worthy of a better execution. Oh well, if we want to see old gods get mixed up with our contemporary world, there's still Thor: The Dark World to look forward to.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
56,tinovalkki,Just another stupid film,4,22 August 2013,"Percy Jackson movies tries to full fill the void that Harry Potter movies left for children (and adult too) fantasy movies, but seemingly doesn't succeed in that. These movies and books are simply too childish to please adult audience. Trying to mix Greek mythology and present day just doesn't work well enough. Storyline and script is annoying childish and clumsy to awake your interest. Script is formal and predictable. Movie looks great but feels empty inside. Somehow the story won't just wake up and it left the viewer outsider just to follow what happens on screen. There must be much progress if they try to get even close to Harry Potter movies. 3D doesn't work and feels useless. It should be filmed as 2D, if they didn't bother mind to use what it has to offer.

Saying that, it is entertaining and has an interesting plot.In my opinion, this film is better than the first. It has better action scenes and the actors gave more realistic and believable performances. Sometimes, I felt that the film was a bit too cheesy and it came across to me that the writers tried a little too hard to make the film funny.I saw this film in 3D and the 3D effects were surprisingly good!

58,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: A Ulysses sized adventure,6,10 August 2013,"This film Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters comes just at the right time of the year for tween entertainment. Summer is winding down, school is about to resume and the demi-gods have an adventure worthy of Ulysses. I thought the opening story of Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) initially arriving at camp and how the shield came to be was creative and brought a level of energy to start things off, however I didn't particularly favor the warrior games, which were more like a round of Wipe Out rather than a show of strength from uber gifted halflings. The updating of the stories of Greek mythology is a great way to get this generation of youngsters invested in the tales. The ability through technology to visually depict the mythological creatures makes it all so much more appealing especially creatures like the hippocampus as seen in the trailer, this has to be the best looking seahorse I have ever laid eyes on. There were other creations throughout the film that were first rate special effects, but I wasn't impressed with Kronos, and don't even get me started on the animated history of Zeus, Poseidon and Hades rebelling against their titan father. I'll just sum it up in a word, cheesy. There was some creative license taken with modernizing the Stygian witches and Hermes (Nathan Fillion) all of whom fit right in to the new age, but alas the Cyclops just never seems to evolve. This second installment of the franchise comes with some new talent like Stanley Tucci (Mr. D) who was almost unrecognizable with the facial hair and the hair, Anthony Head (Chiron) and Leven Rambin (Clarisse) whose character brought a healthy dose of in your face competition to Percy (Logan Lerman). Most noticeably missing were those deities seen in the original film that I thought might make at the very least a cameo, the Olympian Gods. I went to see this film really wanting to like it, since I have been a fan of Greek mythology for most of my entire reading life, but I came away a bit indifferent. I laughed, was never too shocked at anything and also yawned. I do hope that viewers don't just take the film at face value and actually go read up on these amazing stories that these tween adventures were inspired by. I give this film an amber light.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
59,bravesfanc,A bit of a disappointment,4,9 August 2013,"Percy Jackson and his friends return for the sequel ""Sea of Monsters"". I have not read the books so I can't compare the film to the book. But, if the title is ""Sea of Monsters"", shouldn't we see some monsters??? If you want to get technical, sure, there is a one (yeah just one) sea monster they have to encounter, and they are able to manage it with relative ease.Logan Lerman is a pretty good young actor and I've enjoyed his other films as well as the first Percy Jackson which was a lot better than this sequel. The story is simple, the barrier that protects their camp is broken and we find out in the beginning that it was put there because of a sacrifice from one of their own when she was a child. Zues turns the young child into a tree essentially and its the tree that protects the camp. But the tree is poisoned and the barrier is broken through by a very large mechanical bull who shoots fire.The quest is given to retrieve the golden fleece which lies in the Sea of Monsters, which to us humans is the Bermuda Triangle. Percy isn't chosen, but of course, he and his friends decide they need to go because it's part of a prophecy he's involved in. And from there the story goes.There's a couple action scenes here and there but just when it seemed like it might be getting good, it abruptly ends. I'm not sure if the actors tried to improvise or not, because there are more than a few attempts to get quick laughs with one liners which I didn't find all too funny. The one bright spot was Nathan Fillion's character ""Hermes"" who does successfully get the laughs he deserves.Towards the end it gets a bit more entertaining, but by that time it might be too late to get the audience's full attention and not thinking about what to eat after the movie. This is more suited for the young adult genre, (I'm 25) but I enjoyed the first one that I thought I would give this one a shot.Overall, it doesn't live up to its predecessor and the quick attempts at humor and the all too short action sequences leave the audience unsatisfied. 4/10 You can find all my reviews here http://imdb.com/user/ur6157371/comments",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
60,Vincent_B,Percy Jackson: Ocean of Bad Movies,3,20 March 2014,"First this movie was not ""action packed"", rather boring, the poor dialog and phony emotions left a dry taste in my mouth. I am not comparing the movie to the book, since I never read the book, this movie was bad all on its own.The first scene I find questionable is; all the demi-gods (aka half bloods) at a hero training camp, scatter like frightened mice, as the mechanical bull busts through the protective barrier. This leaves only three of the demi-gods to fight and destroy the bull.When the oracle tells Percy about the Titan Kronos, she tells a poor history lesson that Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon killed Kronos when Greek mythology mentions five of six children were eaten by their father and Zeus alone saved his siblings. The prediction by the oracle was pretty clear, yet Percy claimed not to understand what it meant. Also the movie is full of product placement. Hermes runs the UPS store and just happens to hand them two items they will need to complete the quest. There is a pointless scene just about getting coffee. I didn't catch the name of the coffee shop but I am sure that was the point.Continuity fell asleep at the switch, several times, for example; During the escape from the yacht, the scene quickly shifts from night to noon daylight. The plot was transparent, I suppose this movie was made for a younger crowd but I give them more credit than the writers.I won't get into the CGI quality, because I don't care for any movie that depends so highly on the CGI to carry the show. But they used some lower budget effects to reduce the amount of CGI needed. Such as a pair of sunglasses (also didn't make sense) and tight shots of some characters from the waist up. As a personal note, I much prefer to see animatronics and puppetry such as the work of the late Stan Winston.I can't complain too much since my friend rented this one but I wouldn't spend a dime on this movie.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

62,YJLcool,a badly written fantasy adventure film,6,8 August 2013,"Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters feels like a cheap ripoff of the Harry Potter series made for younger kids or teenagers who read the books and would like to see it on the big screen. The script is awfully written, some of the dialogues were bad. Some of the funny scenes earlier in the film feel forced and the jokes were not delivered properly by the characters (found out the screenplay is actually written by the screenwriter who wrote Green Lantern).The storyline is weak and feels out of place. There's simply not enough adventure in the Sea of Monster'S' and the actual quest felt a little too rushed for the audience to feel satisfied. Furthermore, the big finale near the end of the film feels disappointing and lame. Not sure about the novels as I've never read them before, but it seems as if the gods doesn't seem to care much about their half-blood kids (Poseidon seemed to be ignoring Percy despite his many attempts in communicating with him)...There's no appearances of the Greek Gods - Zeus, Poseidon or Hades throughout the film...despite the fact that there's an issue of utmost urgency that requires their immediate attention. One could even question why bother making the half-bloods in the first place?Most of the plot elements felt contrived or questionable...they're just simply there for the sake of the plot (sorry for mentioning some of the plot element, I just couldn't help it):-Out of nowhere, Luke just 'magically' found the Tomb of Kronos?-A powerful crucial magical item such as the golden fleece is only guarded by a Cyclops on an island?-The film's title mentioned Sea of Monster'S', but in the end the audience just get to see just a monster that looks like a maelstrom?-How Grover managed to reach the island in the first place?-How Luke and his crew gets to have a rat-scorpion hybrid monster as a pet in the first place?-Seriously, if Kronos was defeated that easily, then why it needs 3 powerful Greek Gods to defeat him in the first place?-Annabelle mentioned that Poseidon's powers don't work in the sea of monsters since the sea is not within Poseidon's domain of power, but Tyson managed to heal his wound?Not to mention, the film ends in an unsatisfactory cliffhanger as well.There's some character development in the film, especially Tyson, Percy and Luke. The acting performances from actors were fine and the film is entertaining in some parts of the film, but it certainly didn't reach the heights and complexity of the adventures in the Harry Potter series. While fans of the book series might love the film, but for general audiences, this fantasy action adventure is certainly a miss.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

64,aaronjbong,Back to Camp Half-Blood,6,25 August 2013,"Greek mythology returns in ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"", the sequel to 2010's ""The Lightning Thief"". Based on the novels by Rick Riordan, the series puts a spin on the rich mythology by blending it with modern society, which is kind of interesting.The bulk of all the characters here are demigods/half-bloods (offspring of gods and humans). But the protagonist is Percy Jackson, a demigod son of Poseidon. Previously, he along with his besties Annabeth (daughter of Athena) and Grover (a satyr), stopped Luke, the Lightning thief, from destroying Olympus. Here, Camp Half-Blood (demigods' safe haven) are under threat after Thalia's tree, the boundary that protects the camp, is poisoned. The only thing that can heal it is the Golden Fleece which is located on an island in the Sea of Monsters, or what we like to call the Bermuda Triangle. The movie is quite action-packed and pits our hero against a variety of Greek monsters. I loved the scene where the half-bloods had to face the Colchis bull. The mechanical bull was quite extraordinary and that scene was entertaining. However, I felt that the climax was a bit of a letdown as all the tension that had been generated zipped away so quickly. Characters come and go. In ""Sea of Monsters"", much of the ensemble cast that make up the deities from the previous film are absent. We will see no more of Zeus (Sean Bean), Poseidon (Kevin McKidd), Hades (Steve Coogan), Persephone (Rosario Dawson), and Chiron (Pierce Brosnan). That means most of the experienced actors are out (not to forget Uma Thurman as Medusa). In replacement, we get Dionysus portrayed by the reliable Stanley Tucci. The gods Hermes and Chiron have replacements (Nathan Fillion and Anthony Head, respectively). We also have the clumsy but humble Tyson (Douglas Smith), Percy's cyclops half-brother, and the self-eccentric Clarisse La Rue (Leven Rambin), demigod daughter of Ares. The movie had lots of scenes involving special effects. It was okay but it wasn't excellent. Some of the creatures were stunning (the hippocampus was amazing and eye-candy) whereas some looked pretty cheap and effortless (Kronos). Under the direction of a new director, the movie is more faithful to the source compared to the first movie's similarity to the book (although by a tiny bit). But that's not to say some of the scenes diverge from he book. The movie is quite well-paced and during the ride, there are plenty of laughs to enjoy. Overall, ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" is quite an enjoyable film. It's not better than the first and it's not worse than the first. It has quite an interesting premise and some fine action sequences. Rating: 6/10Final Verdict: ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" is a decent sequel that provides plenty of action scenes and laughs, with passable acting and okay visual effects.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
65,dschlatter,"Average, like so many others",6,26 August 2013,"Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief was a pleasant surprise. For me that movie came out of nowhere and I found it to be pleasantly entertaining. Part two? Well, this time I had expectations. Would it hold its ground against the first one? Well, it didn't. It's not at all bad. But it's also not very good. Just OK. So what were my problems with the movie? The entire story is kind of weak. I can't say what the problem was exactly, but let me put it this way: The first 10 minutes of The Last Crusade (Indie) were more thrilling to watch than the entire Percy Jackson movie. (Actually, the tournament at the beginning of Percy was pretty good.) The movie loses its power whenever the scenes cost the most. Does that make sense? The wind-bottle. Why does their zodiac not race across the sea like a torpedo? They seem to be travelling at a comfy 30 mph. Cronos. Why is he so easily defeated? Why is the scene not suspenseful?Luke? Why is he the most boring villain I've had to endure in a long time? He's not menacing... he is just very tired or - possibly - depressed.These are the things that cost the movie a few points.At least Nathan Fillion was delightful. As always.

68,jjgooner,Feels like an amateur production,3,17 August 2013,"Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters*1/2 (out of 4)106 mins/ PGCast: Logan Lerman, Alexandra Daddario, Douglas Smith, Leven Rambin, Brandon T. Jackson, Jake Abel, Anthony head, Stanley Tucci, Paloma Kwiatkowski, Nathan FillionDirector: Thor FreudenthalPlot: Percy Jackson and friends embark on a quest to the Sea of Monsters, more commonly known as the Bermuda Triangle, to retrieve a Golden Fleece which will restore safety to Camp Half-Blood. JJ's Verdict: These days sequels usually go bigger and badder, which causes for a lot of criticism. The film probably took this into account and attempted a scale and story similar to the original Percy Jackson. What they have created however is a film that is a lower key to its predecessor, so much so that it just feels like a cheap direct-to-DVD sequel like many Disney films were given in the 90's. Of course when you criticise a film based on a book you are really criticising the book, but then you can make the argument that if the book is bad then why make it into a film. So I am going to review this film based on the film entirely. Now I've got through that, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is unambitious in its plot, uninteresting in its characters and full of forced and clichéd humour. In this sequel to the popular Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Percy has to travel to the sea of monsters to seek a golden fleece that will bring safety to Camp Half-Blood after the camp was broken into by Luke, the son of Hermes. As he moves further on in his quest he discovers a plot to resurrect the evil Kronos who, if the plot is completed, could destroy all of Olympus. In Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief as well its young leads, boasted a superb supporting cast of Sean Bean, Pierce Brosnan, Steve Coogan, Rosario Dawson, Catherine Keener, Kevin McKidd, Joe Pantoliano and Uma Thurman. In Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, none of these actors return and the well-known supporting cast consists of Stanley Tucci, Nathan Fillion and Anthony Head, with only Tucci being as well-known as the likes of Bean and Brosnan. This is the level of ambition in this sequel and frankly, it is very dull to watch. Where its predecessor faced Medussa, three-headed dogs, Hades and a minotaur, Sea of Monsters faces a mechanical bull, a blind Cyclops and Kronos and the Charybdis who are so easy to kill it is ridiculous. In The Lightning Thief, it was all about Percy discovering the new world he had entered which was very interesting. Sea of Monsters however feels just like a textbook, everyday adventure for a simple-minded and boring teen boy and never really produces any thrills. It is well-paced and has just enough to keep you interested but fails to produce anything that will make you want to see it again. It looks good and although the CGI is obvious, it is still good and imaginative CGI. Since the original's release, Clash of the Titans, Immortals and Wrath of the Titans have all been released. Sea of Monsters tries to make Greek mythology its main point of interest but because of the Greek mythology overload we have received in the past two years it is frankly boring. Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters goes against everything its predecessor did. This is little character development, boring settings and every twist is so clichéd and predictable. Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is not the worst film of the summer. It is however the worst made film of the summer.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
69,koen_smit,A nice Sea of Monsters but no character development.,6,17 August 2013,"The funny thing is that when I went with a friend to this movie who hadn't seen the first one he asked me if this was indeed a kind of Harry Potter but then about demigods. And I did not think about that before then, but I think he is right and I could not shake that feeling off that the writer (and thus the filmmakers) were greatly inspired by the fabulous J.K. Rowling. Which doesn't have to be a bad thing if the story is interesting and entertaining enough. Entertaining, yes but interesting not so. Although this movie doesn't by far reach the high quality of the HP franchise, it's pace is fast, there is some humor in it and the special effects are well done. The water horse and other creatures are beautiful, the riding of the water is cool as well. But this movie lacks greatly in character development. Everyone is only in the moment without showing anything about how they got there and where they would go. That's a basic rule in acting. Just saving the world (again) seems to be the only important thing and problems and quarrels are extremely quickly solved, and on every street corner there is someone who can help them. It was entertaining, but could have been a better movie if they dove deeper into the characters and story. As I remember they did that more in the first one, which makes this one a lesser movie.Maybe it was the cinema (Pathé Haarlem, The Netherlands) that I went to but the 3D quality of the film was not really good. The subs were most of the time still doubled and the images were sometimes really blurry. That was pretty annoying. I would have enjoyed this better if it was not on a 3D screen. Because that could have been the cinema I will try not to let that influence my score.But I think I will start reading the books, to see if they adapted it well or not.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
70,zterrell,Better than expected,7,14 August 2013,"Having read many of the early reviews my wife and I had fairly low expectations for this. We had bought the hype on Wolverine 2 and were very disappointed. That said, we thought the acting was better this go around and the humor was more than welcome, it was refreshing. Not so much for the wit involved, but it added a sense of actual kids (in spite of the age of the actors). Alex was much better this time...and it helped that she didn't have to do as much sword play. She was very weak in the first Percy Jackson. Maybe it had to do with dying her hair. Any way, my wife and I are retired, but we enjoy adventure and clean entertainment. This show filled the bill.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
71,Writer_Commentary,I Liked It,7,7 September 2014,"First off, I haven't read the book this movie is based off of. While it is true that sometimes the book is better, sometimes you don't read the book so that fact doesn't really matter. I thought that this was a pretty good movie. It has everything you could want from a movie, although it can also be a bit confusing in some places. The plot may not sound all that interesting, but it is still worth watching and more interesting than one might think. This movie has action and heroes. You can actually show it to your kids, unlike most movies in that genre. I'm not sure how else I can tell you that this movie was good so I suggest that you watch it and see for yourself how fun it is.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

73,jasonpachar,Go Heroes,10,26 June 2014,"Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Sea of Monsters by Rick Riordian is a classic hit among readers of fans – you would think I would start talking about the movie, not quite, I want to talk about the book first. The book that was crafted by critically acclaimed author Rick Riordian shows us the depth into the Greek Mythology with hippocampus, Cyclops, and then we get past the lightning bolt of Zeus and we go straight to the evil source – Kronos (the demon father of the Big 3 – Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades), is resurrected by draping a cloth, no it's not your ordinary cloth is the powerful Golden Fleece which brings magical powers to any demigod or god, for that matter.Now let's talk about the movie, aside from Chris Columbus's The Lightning Thief, Thor Freudenthal did a very good job of sticking to the book. Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson) reprises his role as well as Alexandra Daddrio (Annabeth Chase) and Brandon T. Jackson (Grover Underwood) with some familiar faces – Nathan Fillion (Castle) as Hermes. But this is not your typical movie – this movie deals with Greek mythology and it teaches the young person watching this movie a great deal about the history of the Greeks and how they actually lived during that time.So, if anything, I took away from this movie a sense of laughter, adventure, some crying moments and a sense of knowing that there is a hero inside of all us. I can't wait to see what they have in store for the next chapter in this series – yes the rest of the 5 books will be turned into movies – Percy Jackson: The Titan's Curse, Percy Jackson: The Battle of the Labrynith, and Percy Jackson: The Last Olympian (which by the way will follow in the footsteps of Breaking Dawn from the Twilight Saga and Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows) – Parts 1 & 2.Go Heroes",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
74,loleewardie,Amazing movie,10,13 December 2020,"To me a movie is a movie and a book is a book. The book is the baseline and the movie will never be identical to the book.

As usual, I did not really catch the trailer before watching the movie (I guess the ones playing on the screen in train stations doesn't really count since I wasn't really paying attention).I've always been interested in Greek mythology, although I could never remember which god killed, married, ate which of his/her son, daughter and wife. I could only remember certain stories like how four seasons came about: Persephone, daughter of Demeter was kidnapped by Hades etc so the movie was definitely able to interest me to watch. The effects was pretty cool, with nice little morale stories like, not judging someone by his race (or in this case for Tyson, the Cyclops, his species) and that our fate is decided by ourselves.I like the concept of how these characters are half-bloods and looking normal in real life, and there's even a fun quiz to test out if you are a ""half-blood"" here! It is kind of fun to be looking at certain unexplainable things in this world in another way, like how the Bermuda triangle aka the Devil's Triangle is where the Sea of Monsters is.I'm really glad that the movie is based on mythological stories, as every single brain cell was screaming ""this isn't even possible!"" when I was watching the show. The sea of monsters did catch my attention as I had always been scared of the sea due to a picture book about the Monsters in the sea I had read when I was really young. But trying to start a ship in the stomach of the monsters with a team of zombies? I almost shook my head in disbelief.I would say this is a safe movie to watch, nice CGI, nothing too ""WOW"" but it wouldn't really disappoint anyone. :)Full review: http://tiffanyyong.com/2013/08/22/percy-jackson-sea-of- monsters-movie-review/",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
76,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,Ball = dropped.,4,20 August 2013,"The original Percy Jackson was a solid, charming flick (worth a 3.75 on the BDBOS...extra credit for Rosario Dawson, because she is HAAWWWT...) Good script, good acting, decent action and effects, Brandon T. Jackson was funny...but would the sequel measure up?No.This movie was BORING. The change in directors and writers was glaringly obvious. (Chris Columbus and Craig Titley for ""Lightning Thief"", Thor Frudenthal and Marc Guggenheim for ""Sea of Monsters"") The script was boring, the action was boring, their faces were boring, it was just...bad. Percy himself went from a likable main character to a whiny kid who gets picked on, even though HE SAVED GODDAMN OLYMPIUS IN THE LAST MOVIE. Plus, if this kid has power over water...why doesn't he simply walk around with Poland Spring bottles on him at all times??? I'm just saying, if it was me, I'd prefer to use my water-bending powers over a short sword any day. The mechanical bull fight, which in all honesty is probably one of the better parts of the movie, could probably have been solved simply with a couple bottles of H20 handy. But, plot holes aside, the bull fight almost seems out of place in this otherwise bore-fest of a movie.This movie is also available in 3D, for some reason. Don't bother. Here's what really upsets me about this. Ever since Harry Potter and (ugh) Twilight, the trend has been to snatch the popular teenage book series and movie-fy them. Everyone's doing it, but some are putting out half-assed movies that they hope will sell based on the strength of the books alone. (I'm looking at you, Beautiful Creatures. God, you were terrible.) Percy Jackson, despite not being the huge blockbuster that Potter or Twilight was, had established itself as legit enough to justify a franchise. But they really dropped the ball here. The characters are no longer likable, the story crawled, many of the scenes were cheezy...this felt like a Disney TV movie somehow got mixed into Percy's universe. Thank God they didn't break into song.Oh, and no Rosario Dawson??? FOR SHAME.Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters scores a 2 out of 5 on the BDBOS. Damn shame.(Hello my friends.

77,rudolfravbar,"Really entertaining movie, but there are a lot of issues!",5,27 February 2015,"If you are not serious movie reviewer and you don't care about acting and some stuff like that and only thing you want is entertainment, well, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is for you.In order to restore their dying safe haven, the son of Poseidon (Logan Lerman) and his friends embark on a quest to the Sea of Monsters to find the mythical Golden Fleece while trying to stop an ancient evil from rising.So Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is the second movie about Percy Jackson. This movie has a really good story. I mean, I like Greek mythology and their gods and I was watching this movie because I wanted more from the Percy Jackson series, but when i read that this is a last Percy Jackson movie, I was disappointed, because I wanted to see full P.J. series transferred in the movie. Like I said, Percy Jackson: Titan's Curse is not going to happen.Bad things about this movie is acting, clichés and some visual effects. In the beginning there is an angry robot bull who is trying to kill everybody, that bull is made pretty bad. It was not convinced. Acting of most of the characters is bad. I mean , they are acting like they are acting in theater. Also, clichés, they are all around the movie. I was trying to ignore them, but I couldn't, like dying scene, I hate those. They are dying and talking. Can you, PLEASE, stop doing that kind of dying, it's not interesting any more.Like I said in the beginning, if you ignore these issues, you will like this movie, but if you don't, well, you will be entertained anyway",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
78,smg242,Honestly a very bad film...,3,1 September 2013,"...I mean come on! Couldn't the writers think of better dialogues? There were SO many times I could think of a better replacement of some really corny, cheesy-ass lines. The lines are just SO predictable and obvious. Clarice gets some pretty decent dialogue, but still, it's sub-par.Not just the lines, but the characters are also what the writers got wrong. Honestly, I've only read the first Percy Jackson book, and nothing else. I haven't even SEEN the first movie. I went to this film with no expectations, and still I found it bad. Logan Lerman is just SO DULL and BORING as Percy. There is nothing special to Percy's character, he's just a normal guy, who's a half-blood. No personality of any kind. The same goes for Annabeth.Grover is actually good comic relief, STRONGLY UNLIKE Tyson. I think it'll be fair enough to call Tyson the Jar Jar Binks of Percy Jackson. Luke could have been a lot better if the would've gotten the right actor. A villain needs to be menacing and cold-hearted. The guy playing Luke is downright whiny.Don't even get me started on the CG. The metal bull looked HORRIBLE. However, the 3-D is better than many of the post-conversions today. The plot is thin, and I mean really, REALLY thin. Some half-bloods, including Percy Jackson, set out to fix the Barrier. By the way, the first scene with Thalia was really good, and gave me hope for the rest of the movie, but after that, it's like the director is saying, ""Let the boredom ensue!"" I may have missed some dialogues and stuff along the way, because I think I dozed off after Clarice defeats Percy in some trial or something.I may have taken a good nap, but my 10-year-old kid didn't. He's a Percy fan, and I think this is the age the film was aimed at. So, take your 10-year-olds. No, actually, let your 10-year-olds go with friends, unless you really want to snooze.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
79,ted-peterson,"""Sea of Thoughtless""",2,11 November 2013,"Spoiler Alert. Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. ""Percy Jackson And The Ocean of Monstrous Ripoffs."" or ""Percy Jackson and the Sea of No Ideas."" Egad, what were the producers thinking? I have to admit that this movie pandered to the thoughtless amongst us to the point of ridicule. The Harry Potter allusion early in the movie where a story was told through animation was atrocious. Oh, a story is told and animated. What a cool concept. It worked in HP so let's steal it and all the kids will go WOW? The animation in HP was really good and the animator did a fantastic job of blending a personal style with a story. Here, it's just hogwash meant to wow audiences will coolness. How cute.The same old nemeses are back with some new ones. Here the kids are away at camp ""We're so special"" and a mechanical bull comes crashing through. Remember the bull in the first movie? So let's make this one mechanical like the robots in ""Hellboy: The Golden Army"" or whatever and kids will go WOW!. Let's defy our elders and run off to find our missing parents or fix our parent's goofs. Let's have an authority figure steal some demigod's idea and present it as his own. OUCH! There's more but why belabor the point. It's all so trite, poorly written and formulaic. People don't die unless they are totally obscure. They have to come back at the last minute to save the day. Not only are they restored to perfect health but they know where to go to find the other protagonists even though they were searching for the place in the beginning. If they know where it is and can get there, why the search?OMG. the lines were just so cool man. Those demigods really know how to sling the lingo even though they live in a place with no outside electronic broadcasts and music. They are supposed to be isolated, misunderstood and ever so cool like the broken children in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" which was actually quite a good movie, but here they are just wooden dorks. Even the females were shadows of women.Language and thought sequence is so juvenile that one weeps for movie making with absolutely seamless special effects where language and thought is so dumbed down that the most intellectually impotent must be the target audience. Have we really sunk so low in our expectation of youth? Adventure/Action movies have always been heavy on the action while being intellectually dishonest. Take ""Armageddon"" for example or ""Transformers"" But in both those movies there was an undercurrent of something happening beyond the foolishness. Here there is just foolishness with no undercurrent. In the Obama age in America, it's hip to be stupid and dependent while telling one's self how clever and smart one really is. And that's what this movie represents in a weird way. It's intellectual onanism at it's finest. The Percy Jackson story could be a compelling tale. The acting is reality TV level except for the characters who play anything but the principals. In other words, the monstrous. The cab driving fates are really entertaining. Some good acting there. There will be a sequel. Smoke a joint and revel in the sheer idiocy of the thing.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
80,Sperry23,Not Bad if You Haven't Read the Books,8,13 January 2014,"Like so many other films, especially those made from Young Adult or Children's books, Sea of Monsters doesn't follow the book very closely. The source material was essentially used as a framework or guideline for the film.The film is even less true to the book than Lightning Thief. However, that being said, the film has adequate SFX, a nice score, and a good bit of humorous dialog and byplay.Casting was OK, but not as good as it could have been. Recasting Chiron and replacing Pierce Brosnan with Anthony Head wasn't the best idea. Although Head plays the part well, it seems he's simply rehashing his role as Rupert Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Also, Dionysus seemed to be written for Bruce Campbell instead of Stanley Tucci. Still, Tucci was OK. But not as good a Bruce would have been IMHO.The CGI was reasonable but nothing outstanding. At least it wasn't the old-fashioned blue screen with the white line around the effect. Somehow, I think having Ray Harryhausen (were he alive) or one of his students, oversee the creature effects would have only improved it. He had significant experience with that sort of film.Still, it was an OK film and nothing to get too worked up over. Sort of lazy Saturday Afternoon fare. YMMV.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
81,thealphakeno,It was actually same plot from the book with a twist,8,9 August 2013,"Percy Jackson: The Sea of Monsters made a big change from the first movie, The Lightning Thief. Fans thought the first one was bad enough to make a sequel but here it is now, on theaters and looks pretty great at all.It starts on Percy introducing himself as for those who haven't watched the first movie and read the book and then jump to the flash back where how Thalia (Daughter of Zeus) sacrifice herself for Luke, Grover and Annabeth. I was scared to be honest while watching the whole film. I'm watching carefully and listening carefully to all the details that are resemblance from the book and this, what I have found out. They skipped most of the scene from the book and manipulated it. It includes the removing of the school, dodge ball scene with Laistrygonian giants (which the first encounter with Tyson as a Cyclops); Grover searching for the Pan in Polyphemus Island, The Circe Island where Percy turned into guinea pig; Tantalus in Camp Half-Blood and the Mermaid thing.They changed some of the plots including how they used the fleece to heal Annabeth, (she should got injured by Polyphemus and not the Manticore.); Silena Beauregard is in the film but already part of Kronos army; the pills changed into a magical tape and the mist becomes a perfume.Everything was mix up but it turns to be great after all. I like it even though it's not 98% the same from the book. They should keep doing a sequel and I believe the fans will understand how it goes that way. Some of the viewers think it sucks once they compare it to the book but if they just start learn how adding some twist on it, it will appear as good like the original at the end.I rated it 85%, not perfect but not bad. It was great and much better than the first one. I wonder why it's still rotten.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

Quality was bad...like a made for TV movie/series.Like Xena or Hercules.Weak dialogie and special effects. Made CGI looked real cheap.Also the 3d effects was nearly non existent.

85,cteavin-1,What could have happened to Harry Potter.,4,1 November 2013,"The Percy Jackson (probable) franchise is a hint as to what Harry Potter might have looked like were it made in the Hollywood studio system. The writing is terrible and the lines read, not acted. (Listen for how the writers try to punctuate every moment with an attempt at wit or humor only to fall flat and disrupt the pace of the film.) The special effects are ladled on without point and while the ideas for some of the creatures and scenes are well realized, I couldn't help wonder if they were a nod to or theft from better films.*Still, if you're tween or just looking for a cinematic escape and nothing else is playing, it's not the worst film you could watch. They set up the ending for a sequel and, depending on the reviews, I might suffer through another if my date cancels or I am very bored. I do not recommend Percy Jackson unless your either into bad fantasy, a junior high student or younger, or want to play Mystery Science Theater 3000. *spoilerish -- I'm speaking of a cab scene and something they find at sea.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

87,SouthSideChgo,You Will Get Fleeced Seeing This Movie,2,6 August 2013,"***contains no spoilers***In all honesty, SouthSide didn't see the first Percy Jackson movie before attending the screening for its sequel last week. However it seems that doesn't matter because this latest book-turned-into-movie franchise has watered down Greek mythology to the point this generation of kids will never know who actually had a quest to find the Gold Fleece.Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is a loosely based (and this reviewer truly means ""loosely based"") on the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts and their quest to find the Golden Fleece which is believed to have healing powers. But instead of having Jason and the Argonauts - it's Percy Jackson (son of Poseidon ...something we are constantly reminded every single time!), his band of friends and half brother, a cyclops named Tyson (shock and awe) set on a quest to find it before before cousin baddie Luke (or Lucas whichever name he answers to) uses it to resurrect Titan Kronos from the grave. And the only place they can find it is in the Sea of Monsters ...hence the movie title.Sighs ...and yes, the ending does set it for another Percy Jackson movie...Save your money because you're going to get horribly fleeced ...even while viewing it in 3D. This reviewer might appear to be bias due to the fact she didn't see this movie's predecessor. Well given the lame jokes and weak story line that reads like an after school special where one learns he's in charge of his destiny, another learns to accept and love himself and another learns not judge others before getting to know them, you really don't need to see the first movie. Go rent the original Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts - both movies feature stop-animated work of the late Ray Harryhausen ...also far worth seeing than this watered down Greek mythological movie.Maybe Zeus should zap Hollywood with a lightning bolt for displeasing the Gods of Olympia...",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

This one one the other hand may have followed the book more but everything sucked the acting, the animation, the changing of pierce Bronson as Cheron, Claries actually being nice and on and on. I mean come on! how could they have went from a let down to a want to kill myself down. In all i would have to say that the Cyclopes scene was the best because of Grover in a dress was just hilarious so good job on that. The worst part of the movie was Tyson, i mean he seemed like some total moron with a face that a first grader animated on. So Yeah STAY AWAY!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
89,cgrill8,Great movie. Better than the first.,8,12 August 2013,"I enjoyed the first movie even though it deviated from the novel. Sea of Monsters tries to correct a bit of the Percy universe towards the good. I thought the movie was great, the CGI decent (could have been better in spots), and the action was fun, and the emotion was uncannily sucked me in. Now I've read all the books and the novels are a hoot. There were a good many original plot points missing... and the ending was completely different. The thing is, they brought two or more of the books together. The only thing I can think of, is maybe when ""Skrone-looking"" (Gauntlet Legends anyone?) Kronos was not at full power when he showed up near the end, but then he's not really supposed to show up. And my friend was put out ""Luke again? over hi father... AGAIN?"" I had to explain how Luke is being used, and Kronos is somewhat possessing Luke (something not mentioned in the movie). Plus if the whole idea was to revive someone at the end (not Kronos)... then this breaks the plot of the original plot badly... because it's was Luke's plan from the beginning and WHY the tree is poisoned to begin with. Overall, I'mm the only one in my family that reads the books, and only knew about the inconsistencies. But everyone absolutely love the sequel over the first movie, and may very well have my little girl wanting to read the books now finally.

92,twilightshadows-428-400303,"If you love the books, you will hate this movie",2,28 July 2018,"Watched recently with my daughter who is a huge fan of the books. She had sworn she would never watch it because she was so aggravated at the first one. For some reason she decided she wanted to see how bad it was. She ranted through the entire movie. It's been a while, but I read the first series. She is rereading them so it was fresh in her mind. We both decided they rewrote almost the entire movie. Much has been covered in other reviews, so I'm going to stick mostly with what I haven't seen mentioned, 2 points of which we thought were the most aggreageous. First, how do you get the mythology wrong, in both movies? Admittedly the first movie was the more glaring. Having Persephone in the Underworld at that time of year destroys the entire myth, but this one wasn't much better. Kronos was not just evil. He swallowed his children to prevent a prophecy that one of them would overthrow him. However, he did not swallow Zeus as his wife tricked him into swallowing a stone instead. Zeus grew up in hiding and then freed his siblings from inside Kronos and then they defeated Kronos. They completely destroyed the character of Luke along with the story of the cursed blade. Luke's story is tragic and complicated, but there are 4 events that lead to his being vulnerable to Kronos, each one making him angrier and more bitter. One of them, however, is the death of Thalia, which could easily have been covered. While he does poison Thalia, he does not intend for her to die. He planned to return with the fleece and cure her once he resurrected Kronos. He believed she would join him. Note too that Kronos appears in his dreams and plays on his anger. There is some indication Kronos may even be influencing him. He also doesn't die here. Near the end he resurrects Kronos by serving as his vessel. But Luke then fights back. Eventually he sacrifices himself to prevent Kronos full return and is recognized as a hero. His last words are a plea to Percy to take care of the others like him to make sure this never happens again. The cursed blade is celestial bronze and steal molded together, so it can kill both nonhumans and humans. It's an abomination and should not exist, but is given to Luke by Kronos. He calls it Backbiter. It is not Percy's sword, and neither Percy nor Thalia is the child in the prophecy. The child is Luke, and he saves Olympus with his sacrifice. Why they changed the story I cannot fathom. It's a much more powerful story as written. I understand that changes have to be made in transferring to film, but the Harry Potter series did it and managed to not only keep the main plot and spirit of the books, but by starting with actors of the right age, also covered the entire series. Having seen that it can be done just makes the Percy movies all the more disappointing. Our only saving grace is it has been confirmed there will be no more. Maybe a few years from now Fox, who owns the film, tv, and game rights, will get a clue and redo the series properly. My daughter and I think it would make a great animated series for television. There are no limits or time pressures in animated, so they could pretty much stick to the story, treating each book as a season. Then we could all get together and burn the discs for the movies.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

Both of the films have been poor and especially with this sequel.Similar to the Eragon film, I thought they would scrap a sequel (same with Eragon, film was terrible in comparison to the books), and was extremely surprised to see adverts for it, and I regret giving the film series another chance.The story is based on the book, but misses out large parts and includes some strange substitutes that don't enhance the story at all.Overall, I would give this film a pass.

95,jaredsemingson,The continuing sage of Percy Jackson and his friends,7,19 August 2013,"I give this one a 7. The movie did it's job. I just think it could've been better. It had the potential. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the movie. OK, so there are cool special effects, Greek god children, mythical objects, and hand-to-hand combat. Was the first movie better? YES. This one doesn't explain the details. I was constantly thinking, ""Why did this happen, why did that happen?"" I don't know if it was because I didn't read the book or because they didn't write the script well enough. The movie was enjoyable and I would watch it again. I have since watched the first movie ""Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief"". Way better story line. The watcher cares about the characters. In this one, I don't know. Why is Percy so pitiful in the beginning? In the last movie he starts out with no purpose and becomes who he needs to be. Awesome. In the second movie, Percy starts out weak and unsure of himself, AGAIN. In my opinion, he should already be ""the man"". He goes through the same struggle of proving himself in this movie. Why? Other than the flaw in the writing, or flaw in the story (which is the same thing) I liked it.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
96,Soul4673,Opinions vary on this film......but I'm going to focus on the positive.,10,7 August 2013,"Honestly I thought this film was going to suck. I am a HUGE fan of the books....I have read them about 5 times and truthfully after watching the first film and how far it fled from the book I thought this film would be a lot worse than what it was. So, OK I went to watch this film in 3D with my mother and I am pretty sure I bored her by saying ""that was in the book."" OVER and OVER. The opening to this film begins with a camera following the sea and slowly sinking under and then revealing the title ""Percy Jackson and the sea of monsters"" in what looked like iron writing during which Logan Lerman is giving a speech about how the Greek gods are real and how 7 years ago 4 demigods tried to get into Camp Half Blood then the camera zooms from aerial shot of a forest to 4 young children. 2 girls and 2 guys. A creature is chasing them but we don't see this creature until later as this explains another part of the character ""Annabeth"" One of the guys gets knocked over by this creature and is picked up and dragged into the camp by young Annabeth and young Luke while a black haired girl named Thalia yells that she'll hold it off and for them to go. She is then thrown to the ground and dies in a position where she's flailed in several directions...Percy then continues to narrate saying that Zeus let her live in another way and as he says this Thalia's body begins to turn into a tree and this tree then forms a blue barrier which eventually becomes transparent as Annabeth, Luke and Grover enter the camp. I actually found this to be a strong opening as it showed us 2 of the main characters' journey as well as the main villain's plus the effects were amazing as well as the acting.Anyways in the books from sea of monsters onwards Tyson was always my favourite character....and he did not disappoint in this film. I loved the clutzy lovable guy he was in this film. He was so cute actually. Douglas Smith portrays a character full of hope and love and optimism and this character actually makes the film. In a weird way he reminded me of Doug from the Pixar film up.....not in a mean way. He was just lovable and cute and charming and loved Percy from the minute he laid ""eye"" on him (haha....cheesy Cyclops joke) which reminded me of ""I just met you and I love you."" The line which Doug says to Mr Frederickson when they first meet. I found both his portrayal of my favourite character and the brotherly chemistry between Percy and himself to be stunning actually. How he sacrifices himself to save Percy and says ""You'd do the same for me."" and then falls of a cliff into water actually made me cry especially when Percy's grieving and says ""I never even called him brother."" I don't know how the world saw Douglas Smith as a clumsy Cyclops but truthfully I couldn't be more in love with what I saw from him today.OK....first of me and mum are both HUGE fans of the Logan Lerman film ""the perks of being a wallflower"" and since watching it about 10 times in a week it is slightly tough to see him as anymore than the emotional character of ""Charlie"" but both characters of Charlie and Percy were perfectly portrayed by Logan Lerman and I am actually really proud of his performance in this. He portrays the wounded hero extremely well. The hero without a quest who cannot contact his father. I love Logan Lerman. I really do and I love Percy Jackson...so to me this was a perfect combination.Truthfully the reviews on this film maybe mixed and some may choose to focus on the bad like how the voice over was sometimes too obvious and how the story ran to quick from disaster to disaster but there are so many things that are admirable about this film which cannot be ignored like the flawless casting and the brilliant lines and how it seemed to flow from scene to scene without stopping as well as how it seemed to stick to the book's storyline. I don't know whether this series will continue but I REALLY hope it does as I'm not ready to say goodbye to Percy and Annabeth and Grover and Tyson yet.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

98,jparker9899,Best Thing About This Is The Special Effects,2,11 August 2013,"This movie was a major disappointment in my opinion. I've read the books and I loved them so I thought the movie would be pretty good too! I was wrong. Problem one is that it was a little too slow. They could have easily shortened 10 to 15 minutes of this movie but yet unnecessary parts were added. Problem two is that the acting was just not good. They could have done a much better job and at least tried to act in character. The biggest problem is that this movie was just stupid. It took them up until the last 20 minutes to reach their destination and to get to the whole point. Up until then there were just time wasters. The only good thing about this film is the special effects. I saw this in 3-D and i give it applause for its amazing graphics and special effects. Other than that though, this movie isn't worth seeing, it has countless flaws and problems. Don't waste your money on it.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
99,DTKinetic,Overly Cartoonish Sequel,4,16 August 2013,"I am a fan of the premise behind Percy Jackson. The first movie The Lightning Thief introduced me to the books, I read the series, and now just followed up with the second movie.While I can note that some disliked the first movie due to adaptation inconsistencies, the first movie was still thrilling, well- paced, had a nice blend of action styles with the right touch of fantasy and comedy.The second movie completely lacks those pros and I felt as a film--book fanatic or not--it was disappointing.The beginning camp scenes were spot on and impressive, but after the group embarks on their quest, the entire movie feels all too Disney- esque, greatly lacking a feel of seriousness/urgency that would make me care enough for the story. Everything except action is used in overabundance.CGI: Occasionally impressive, but the ENTIRE movie relies on it. When you see the backgrounds flash at sonic-speed in the taxi, Percy wave-surfing with Luke, and Greek mythological characters too casually tossed in the real world environment, the CGI really loses credibility. Script: The script is horrible and the acting is very dry from all main characters--all voices were level the entire movie. Tyson's character is obsessed on the ""Brother""-hood between him and Percy, you hear the word in his every other sentence. And a sickening amount of one liners. A couple may get a laugh, but they were beating a dead horse with 20+ of them, like they were trying to turn the comedy undercurrent into a subgenre.Action: Action was not memorable--unlike the Medusa, Las Vegas and NYC scenes in The Lightning Thief. The bull scene and final scenes had the most of it, but the middle was left largely unfulfilled with only quick snippets of it, but generous portions of dialogue and CGI.Music: Another movie with a ubiquitous never-ending orchestra soundtrack, just to glorify ""the heroic parts"" and string together the filler. For the most part, the music does nothing for the excitement of the movie, and with that said sometimes plain silence (or tracks from some signed artists) would be nice.And without spoiling the movie, the climax really doesn't offer a sense of dread or fear instilled in the later books, due to revealing a certain feature of the book WAY too early and dealing with this ""feature"" way too easily.My only hope is that I watched this knowing that Sea of Monsters was my least favorite book in the series, so I'm hoping the same rule applies with the film.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

Avoid at all costs. Let me tell u a line for this s*** ( after Percy's brother dies) "" I didn't even call him brother, a brother is a he wanted"" COME ON! This is garbage.

101,seshimaroo,Paves a Promising path for a sequel,7,21 August 2013,"My expectations were very low for this movie. The reviews were rotten, I could tell it was nothing like the book from just the trailer, and it was cut from the ugly cloth of the Lightning Thief movie, despite both films being based upon source material with limitless potential. After watching this movie in the theater and bracing for Logan Lerman's flawless portrayal of dirt, I ended up getting thrown a real treat. Not to say it was a really good movie. The acting ranged from good to sickening. The plot was already cursed to be soiled due to the the first film's failure at adaptation. Half the characters introduced in the first novel, but not the first movie, came up this time. It was nice to have Mr. D and Clarisse, and even Chris Rodriguez, make an appearance on the screen. Despite this, the script itself was full of corny lines (mostly uttered through the mouths of Logan Lerman and Alexandra Daddario). Some of my favorite script moments were Tyson's little comments here and there,(""At least there's no line."" and when he sings an all too familiar song...)and then Hermes(Nathan Fillion) was well adapted and written, and also portrayed well by the actor. Another thing to note was the film's overall humor. In the first film, the characters took the story so seriously, it was hilarious without their intention. In this film, the filmmakers, writers and actors, actually intend to have fun and be ridiculous, which makes the film more worthwhile.I can't say the visual effects were the best, but they really weren't that bad. Many reviewers site ""video-gamey"" CGI. Well, if it's video game graphics, then it's the best video game graphics I've ever seen. They aren't super-realistic, but the special effects are decent.I have to point out that there was an awesome scene of CGI when the Oracle explains the story of Kronos to Percy. This scene was creative and well done, especially with it's stain-glass window style.The film's score (composed by Andrew Lockington) was pretty epic, but not entirely memorable. It won't get much awards, but it was really well done and held the movie together.Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters only settles for being an ""okay"" movie. There are constant deviations from the novel, only decent scripting, acting, visual effects, good music, and mixed acting. However, it is not a waste, especially for fans of Percy Jackson. I enjoyed the movie, and The Sea of Monsters is my favorite book, despite changes. Now that many characters and plot points have been set into place after being shattered y the first film, the makers of this film have paved a promising path for another film that may be even better than the first two.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
102,giorgiothesmurf,An unexpected pleasure!,6,7 August 2013,"So I went into the movie theater saying to myself, ""this is going to be bad..."" I was totally wrong. We were able to see the entertaining relationship between Percy, Grover and Annabeth once again with extra side characters in the mix. All of the characters were very well written and most of the acting was good! They took this movie a whole lot more serious than other action and adventure movies that have way too much comedy, this movie delivered less comedy. This movie has great mythology and adventure most of the time. One of my favorite scenes was the sequence inside the monster in the Sea of Monsters, it was exciting, adventure packed and suspenseful. There were some scenes that are just so ridiculous, slow and cheesy. When you have a movie that focuses on adventure and monsters, you need to have great CGI. We received horrible CGI throughout the whole entire movie and that really takes away from the enjoyment. I wish they made the scenes have more action but we did get a whole ton of adventure with a ton of monsters! And I am a big fan of monsters and I wanted the movie to be 30 minutes longer and make it more action packed! P.S. The ending is quite awesome! 6/10",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
103,cocopunk1486,"Chris Columbus directed, enough said",4,15 January 2014,"Yet another horrid example of book-to movie cross overs. Columbus yet again fails to do what he so brilliantly did with the first two Harry Potter installments. The moral of this film, STICK TO THE BOOK!!! After the horrible film that was the Lightning Thief, Columbus and the writers set the sequels to destroy everything the books created. Casting actors in their late 20s, completely disregarding the bulk of the plot, and relying on CGI far too much to create the world of the gods, I didn't expect much coming from this film so I can't say I was disappointed. There were a few bright points, the actors gave good performances and the CGI was cool though in my opinion overused. I guess if you started with the films and rather the books you'd enjoy this, but seeing as I'm a fan of the novels, I really can't stand this series. I hope to the GODS the don't try to make a ""The Titan's Curse"" because that's my favorite installment of the series.My main complaint is the same, they didn't stick to the book. I understand that there are certain things that one can skip, but disregarding the whole plot is another. I watched the film again on DVD, hoping I'd find something else positive about the movie that I didn't catch in the theaters, but again I was let down.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
104,rodriguezjace,Good but bad,6,16 May 2020,"I think if you watch the movie without thinking about the books or not knowing the books you'd find it a decent to good movie. I liked it a little more than the first one and I think it was a little more book accurate, but when you say ""little"" I speak about like 3% more.I think some things are just off and I'm happy the series died and we'll get a reboot. With that sad, I do enjoy both this one and the first one, but I can't think too much about it as the Percy Jackson & The Olympians book.While the books are so different, the movies just try to make it it's own stories inspired by the books and turn it into Harry Potter but instead of wizard we get demi-gods.I stay thinking these movies kinda ruined Grover and Annabeth seems less interesting. Feel like Logan Lerman is a great actor, but well it's 50/50, the only ones portrayal I liked was Douglas Smith as Tyson while not thinking too much about the books.I would've given it a 7 for the movie, but because I love the books so much I would give it like a 4 because of the effort being so low.

2- The Propercy was screwed up. The curse blade was Riptide. The age was 20. 
3- few happened the opposite of what happened in the book. 
4- some were ridiculous. For instance, it took Percy five years to beat Kronos. It took him five minutes in the movie. So powerful Titans, huh. This is going to be to make the third one. The ending and Thalia's story were the only things right.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
106,vijayprasanna2896,Tiring to watch.,3,10 April 2015,"What I am amazed about this movie is that it fails on so many levels and being a person who has read the book, I have to ask myself, does it do justice to the book? NO . On the contrary it violates it and makes a laughable movie out of it. The movie tries to take hold of it own destiny by writing it's own story, but it what it finally delivers is a complete mess of wasted talents and bad story telling.I just felt the movie got goofy at times and the actors try so hard to sell it but its pathetic to watch them fail. Logan Lerman and Alex Daddario are the only ones that keep this movie from drowning in its own sea of atrocity. If it was intended to be breezy yet kind of an entertaining action flick for young adults , then on that basis I can give credit that movie has succeeded. But if you are expecting for a solid movie with a sound plot and edge-of-the-seat action,this is not your pick, trust me. The film overflows with sickeningly corny dialog, predictable moments and cliché that you wince in disturbance. Actors try to give life to the characters but that it works only to some extent because by the end of the movie you would lying to yourself if said you cared for any of them. Some scenes in the movie were useless weight to the run time and some weren't used to their fullest potential. Not a great movie and I am disappointed how one of my favorite book franchises has been treated with callous movie making.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
107,cleontico,AAAAAHHHHH! What have they done? (Dramatic Music),3,23 January 2014,"Okay, I'll chill out enough to write this review. Geez, what did they do? They messed up the story even more than they did in the first movie. Here is a list of negatives and the few positives:Negatives: 1. Where are the gods?2. Luke fell into the cyclop's cave. Did it eat him? If it did, what the hell? He can't die, he's vital to the plot, especially in the last book! He saves Olympus and everything, remember? You read the books, right?3. Annabeth is so dumb in the movie it hurts. I mean, she is the daughter of Athena. In the books she was so smart and such a great character. In the movie they turned her into a complete damsel-in- distress. It's so annoying.4. What the heck was it with revealing the prophecy in the second book? The prophecy wasn't revealed until the last book.5. They resurrected Kronos in the second movie, already? He is only resurrected in the fourth book.They basically gave away too much. There is no point in making Book 3 and Book 4, even Book 5. Positives:1. Humor.2. The music was pretty good.3. The effects were pretty good.WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!!!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
108,tonybaiden,A spectacle to watch,4,7 August 2013,"There comes a time when book adaptions don't stick to the original source material much. Like number 1, Sea of Monsters didn't, but I guess that is good as you don't know what might happen, like other films. It was a fun journey with nice 1st person views. The special effects were epic. It was exciting and had great action sequences. The film flowed really well, but like most films it had quite a few downsides. I didn't find it as fun The Lightning Thief and it was far to easy to tell what was going to be in 3D and what wasn't, kind of like it wanted to own the box office desperately and some CGI was unrealistic. 7/10",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
109,kmtwalsh,Not a worthy sequel,2,17 July 2016,"I had watched the first movie without knowing anything of the characters and stories in the book and found myself really enjoying the first film so I was really excited to watch the next in the series.The story continues with Percy Jackson and friends back in camp. Percy is worried about his legacy compared to Clarisse, his competitive camp mate who is making a name for herself in the demigod world. When their camp is attacked and the barrier is weakened, Percy and his friends go on a mission to retrieve the Golden Fleece they think will restore the barrier. Percy also has to deal with a half-brother he never knew existed.What a disappointment it turned out to be. The film was boring, it dragged too much and it suffered from the lack of star power that enhanced the first film. There is Stanley Tucci as Mr D, God of Wine etc who I thought made the film a lot less dull especially when his wine was turned into water by Zeus for a misdeed he committed. Anthony Head pops up in the Pierce Brosnan role and does as good a job as he can with the script. Ron Perlman is one of the voices, although you don't see him on film. The one actor I struggled with was Nathan Fillion as Hermes. Love him in Castle but I just didn't think he was any good in this.It is a shame that it lost it's way through mostly the script and as there has been no mention of a third film, this movie has stopped anymore being made so far.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

Classic mythology always had a lesson to teach; pity the makers of this movie managed to miss that.The original, I bought and watch regularly even now.

The things I expected on this film, was Percy rescues Camp Half Blood, Percy becomes popular, everyone's happy, Annabeth is in love with Percy and they kiss. But NO! Seriously, the movie can even reach Harry Potter's greatness and perfection, and the lines were delivered perfectly with the actors, but certainly what I hated about this is the fact Clarisse messes up with the son of Poseidon who apparently saved the whole Olympus from endangerment, but it was still entertaining with the two mishap relationship with each other. But the token or the asset of the movie was the story and visual effects, but this movie isn't a film that let's the visual effects do the work and make a bad story line, but they both made a spectacular movie with great actors,lines, VISUAL EFFECTS, STORY LINE .The whole movie can just make you contented with the movies you actually wanted.... It's a great roller coaster ride and the most funniest part is where in Percy meets his brother who apparently has one eye only because he is a half cyclop .

The acting is mostly god-awful, with a few decent performances sprinkled in. However, as a huge fan of the books, I still get enjoyment out of this film.I hated the first one for its huge deviations from the book. While this one certainly deviates, it makes a much better attempt to stick to the source material. A lot of sequences from the movie were directly from the book, and when this happens, it's extremely enjoyable. In particular, the Oracle of Delphi is exactly as I pictured it. Tyson is portrayed pretty much as I remember him. So is Annabeth. The large cyclops at the end (don't remember his name) was also done pretty much exactly how he was in the books, down to exactly how Grover manages to avoid getting eaten by him. They even included Clarisse's giant Confederate ship, which was in the book.Overall, despite the lack of technical quality, I enjoyed this film, and have watched it multiple times.

So they fixed Annabeth's hair color, but that was about it. They changed so much about the story that it didn't resemble much of the original. The movie seemed quite forced and choppy. I felt myself feeling confused most of the time instead of enjoying the show. The whole point of the fleece is that it is a thing of nature; which is what draws Grover to it. Polyphemus lived on a beautiful island, due to the power of the fleece. I think that the movie writers should have read the book first before they embarked on making a movie about it. If they plan on continuing with the series and move on to the Heroes of Olympus they will run into a few snags in telling that story because a couple of the characters were left out of the telling of Circe's island; which was NOT an amusement park.

I expected even some poetic license, and that the characters would not be the age expected from the books. I did not expect that the story would only kind of follow the book, it has the title after all. The writers take a lot of license with this story. I feel bad for the actors, they are given horrible lines and bad jokes to try and pull off. We don't even get a chance to get in touch with and care about the characters. This and the previous Percy Jackson movie could have been huge blockbusters if they had just stuck to the story more and developed the characters a little. This is why when it came out in theaters I did't even hear about it. Its hard to rave about something that sucks. I'm Glad I only heard about it when it was available to rent.

118,ethannorthup,A complete failure of a sequel,3,21 September 2019,"The first film is a pretty good movie, even though it's a lot different from the source material.However, because the first movie made so many changes to the plot of the first book, they kind of wrote themselves into a hole. They changed the ending that set up the plot for the rest of the books, so they couldn't continue on with the rest of the series in the same way the books are set up.The title of this movie is misleading because it's not really just an adaptation of ""the sea of monsters"" book (2nd in the series). This film is actually an adaptation of the last four whole books in the series squeezed into one movie. Supposedly they did this because the actors were getting too old to play the characters and they just wanted to get the series over with as soon as possible.As you would expect, the result is a disjointed, confusing mess of a film. Not only is more than half of the characters and plot points from the book series completely cut out to save time, it's not even a very good movie on its own when you ignore the source material.Just watch the first movie and pretend this one doesn't exist. Or better yet, read the books or listen to the audiobooks. It's a great series, I've read it several times. The movies watered down the story into just a cheesy hunger-games style teen fantasy drama, which is totally NOT what the books are like at all.

However, this film took me completely by surprise. Great for all of the family, it serves the purpose of danger, drama and adventure, just as Percy Jackson should always be. The slightest hint of romance was also present in this film, with the Percy/Annabeth plot line much more vibrant in this second film than in either it's corresponding book, or the first film, which should help to keep the audience enthralled with the series. Although this was different in the books (there was nothing but friendship between the two until book 4) I think this was a strong move for the writers to make.I do wonder how many of these films they are planning to develop; with five books I would hope all five would be filmed. There are hints that the final book at least will be developed into a film, with the introduction of Percy's prophecy in the Sea of Monsters. The characters were ever lovable; Percy's charm, Annabeth's wit and Grover's humour. Leven Rambin made a extraordinary portrayal of the character Clarisse, capturing her fire and competitiveness, much like her portrayal of Glimmer in The Hunger Games. Douglas Smith also made the character of Tyson lovable, with his goofiness; the character proving himself, mostly to Annabeth by the end of the film. This film is great family entertainment (Logan Lerman attracting the attention of the teenage girls) and one of my favourite aspects of the series is the lessons that they teach children about mythology (though I would suggest reading up on it, as many of the myths and fables are changed to suit the film!) These books actually helped me a lot in my Latin classes, so I would recommend them to anyone!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
121,iheartmilkshake,Butchered,2,3 May 2018,This movie butchered the story from the book. It literally changed so much. Fun fact: the kids in the books are meant to be 13. This film is a horrific representation of the book. The only way you can like this film is if you didn't read the book.,Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
122,LadyJessicaDarke,Percy Jackson: Sea of Meh,5,7 August 2013,"There are days I don't get Hollywood. These are days that end in Y.Why would you make a sequel to a critically and financially maligned movie? Why would you cast a 23 year old as a *young teen*? Why would you wait three years between films. These are the questions I had when I saw the first trailer to Percy Jackson SoM awhile back. Now that I have seen the film I can say with all honesty I still don't know the answers to any of those questions.Perhaps it's because I am not the right age. This movie is clearly targeted at a significantly younger demographic than sat in the theatre last night. Appropriate considering the directors (Thor Freudenthal) other known work is also based on a children's book series (Diary of a Wimpy Kid). Lets not get into the fact that a man named Thor is directing a movie about Greek gods. The writing never quite delivers on any of the promises it wants to make, again showing its target. When I was a lovely ten year old girl I would have been quite OK with the superficial story telling, plots so thin they are transparent and interpersonal conflicts that seem to be resolved at the drop of the hat. This my friends is the work of Marc Guggenheim, one of the 4 men in the writing credits of that gem ""Green Lantern"". Same writer and it shows.But Jess! It's based on a book. That is true. I happened to be in a showing with half a dozen fan girls of the book. When asked what they thought in comparison to the source material it was a universal ""well they fixed this from the first and still got all this wrong."" Acting and Casting! That can save even a badly written movie. Alas, we have a 27 year old playing a character in her teens that is nearly as wooden as the acting in Avatar the Last Airbender. Alexandra Daddario's performance as Annabeth the daughter of Athena fails nearly as much as it did the first time. I really want the writer to go back to basic college mythology and look up Athena. Do it. Really. She emulates nothing. Logan Lerman who actually can act does well enough as the titular character. They all needed to look at the eminent Stanley Tucci who phones in a performance as Mr D; even as uninspired and seemingly bored he still has more talent and charisma than nearly the entire cast combined. Nearly. Nathan Fillion. He plays Hermes also known as Nathan Fillion. Love him. He even was able to get a Castle AND Firefly joke into the movie.The rest of the film seems to exist. The effects are Made for TV movie level; still better than a SyFy original, but only just. The camera work is there, nothing special other than no shaky cam - so thank you there. TL;DR?The movie is a resounding meh. It had entertaining moments, eye rolling moments, thankfully no true groaner or why is this in the film moments. It *is* in fact slightly better than the original, which I have to confess own and enjoy. Unless you are somewhere between 8 and 12, then you might really like it. Unless you've read the book.Overall I enjoyed it but I wouldn't have missed much waiting til DVD and neither will you. Once again I think Percy will be second best around.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
123,st-evi-15,Awful,3,20 January 2014,"That was awful. It was even worse than the first and that says a lot. There were so many things wrong with it. From the plot, the acting, the story and the characters themselves. The books are responsible for the last two but since I haven't read them, I formed my opinion about them from the movies only. They may be way better in the books but in the movies they are boring and shallow. The only characters who are worth some attention are Grover and Clarisse. All the others are annoying. The action was almost non-existent and whenever it appeared it managed to make the movie even worse. Ant that is an accomplishment. It seemed that the movie lasted for centuries and I seriously lost count at how many face-palms I did during those hours.P.s The fleece was awful. It looked like a tablecloth!!!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
124,jamesontui,Great movie!,8,8 August 2013,"The movie was great! If you read the books, then you should know that it doesn't follow the book exactly. Percy doesn't have a connection with grover, Percy never turns into a hamster, and a few other things where different. but other than some small part, it remained true to the book. The characters in the movie were all true to the characters from the books and all of the major book scenes where included on the movie. They did add a little twist at the end, but it turned out to be very entertaining. I can't wait for the third movie to come out and if it is anything like this on it should be very good.This was a great movie! It is definitely one the whole family came enjoy!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
125,iamcatpants,Disappointment,4,8 August 2013,"As a major fan of the books (notice the name) I was very disappointed. The first one was bad, but I had higher expectations for this one. Major parts of the novel were skipped, as well with events that happened in the fourth book were shown in the second movie. Kronos is shown rising, which doesn't really happen until The Last Olympian, book 5. I was thankful that they included the story of Luke, Annabeth, and Thalia. Then again, they had to. The entire story is based off saving Thalia's tree. The friend that was with me enjoyed it, but she hadn't read the book. In other words, if you haven't read the book you might enjoy it, if you have, prepare to be disappointed.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
126,kanisadrian,"They need a remake, not a sequel",7,17 November 2013,"First of all, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is a very very decent movie.I really like the stunning effects and a pretty good acting. But it's a total shame that everything is written poorly. It's great that this movie is more true to the book than the first one, but some things just can't mix in with the next one.If I put this movie next to my Harry Potter Movie Collection, I would choose Harry Potter because everyone would agree that it's one of the best book-to-movie, because it not just the writing stays true to the book, but also captured the essence of the book and made it to life.On the other hand, Percy Jackson and the Olympians (and the sequel series, Heroes of Olympus) is an amazing book series. But the movie is just not ready to be seen, because it needs more work and it needs to be handled by other people.So, what this phenomenal book series need is a remake 10 years later with perfect writing and mind-blowing actors. I hope they will do this and see that this is not just a mere kids movie, but a genuine movie that people of all ages will love.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
127,matt-babineau,A letdown and a step backward for Percy and the gang.,4,18 August 2013,"I have to say that I didn't hate the film adaption of the first Percy Jackson book. I mean, when it comes right down to it, it wasn't anything like the book, but it was itself a decent movie. I still would have liked to see more faithfulness to the book, though, and for that reason, I did not enjoy that film.So I had high hopes for the sequel, and I recently had the opportunity to see it. And I was... pretty disappointed. Especially with all it had going for it after the first hour and fifteen minutes. Let me explain.The exposition I thought worked. They had to change a lot of events (because of screw-ups done by writers of the first film) so I was expecting that, and the way they did it worked. But I also noticed the movie's first slight slip-up: Tyson.I won't give away who exactly Tyson is, but in the book, he's a teenage character who acts and talks like a child. The writers of this movie got him half-right. He acted similar to his book counterpart, but his speech? Not so much. But I was able to let that slide as long as the movie itself was a good adaption.And for the majority of the movie, I thought it was. Sure, some of the dialogue was awkward and the CGI was about on par with Doctor Who, but it adapted the book well. That is, until the climax.I won't give too much away, but basically, the writers added a second, completely unnecessary sequence that was really the true climax of the film. Sure, the book's climax was there and done well, but... this was just totally pointless. This was what ruined the movie for me. I was just waiting for someone to shout ""April Fool!"" but when no one did, I literally said under my breath in the theater: ""They're not actually doing this, are they?"" I mean, they were so close to making a decent adaption, and then they go and mess the whole thing up. I just. Ugh.The ending, though, was done right, so I give the movie credit for that, but... that climax really wrecked it for me. In any case, this makes me even more curious to see how ""The Titan's Curse"" is adapted, but I won't see it in the theater. Thank God for Redbox.So, to conclude, this movie was mediocre. The dialogue was weak, the CGI was terrible, the acting wasn't great, and... ugh, that climax! That's not to say there wasn't ANYTHING good in it, because there certainly was, but I guess there was just more bad stuff than there was good stuff, and that's enough for me not to recommend ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.""",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

129,bennorthcott29,Better than the First,7,27 February 2014,"The second Percy Jackson film is a decent effort with a good start and great cameos from Nathan Fillion and Stanley Tucci.Logan Lerman:I feel that Logan Lerman does an okay job in this film although I think that he lacks the attitude he had in the first film. He plays the hero well and seems natural in his actions and as the character of Percy. I prefer his performance as Charlie in 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower'but he does an okay job.Alexandra Daddario: Alexandra Daddario does a pretty poor job as the character of Annabeth. Instead of being smart and kick-ass, she is needy, reliant on Percy, dumb, unnatural and more of a lover than a fighter. The only good part to her act is that she is now blonde.Brandon T Jackson: He seems as more of a deliberately comical character instead of adding any meaning or purpose to the story, I think that this takes away from the drama and intensity of this film.Leven Rambin: Leven Rambin does an excellent job as Clarisse and is kick-ass, controversial, argumentative and competetive she showcases all of her talent in this film aand does a fantastic job. It misses out scenes like the Sirens and especially Circe's island which would have made the film better however it sticks closer to the story than the first and has an interesting storyline.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

I have been a HUGE fan of Percy Jackson since I was a kid and didn't actually think the first movie was that bad. Sure it changed things, but I could forgive that. I could forgive the change of age, the change of motivation and a whole host of other issues. What I cant forgive is the ending of this mess.Out of all the books, I admit that Sea of Monsters is the one I like the least, but I LOVE Titans Curse. With the ending of this, they have basically scuppered any chance of the events I love going through. Cronus should NOT be back this early in the story! At this point, just about the only thing that it has in common with the books is the characters. Why? Whats the point in making an adaptation if your going to change that much? They didn't do it in Harry Potter and I'm pretty sure they didn't do it in Lord of the Rings! Hell, even with the changes made to the Hobbit, the events were still fundamentally the same, just with some extra events to add to them.

Bad acting, cliché lines(the whole scrips was like made from a 10yo). Moments that would of been funny some 15-20 years ago. Bad CGI (Tyson's eye looked ridiculous, the wave that Percy made when escaping Lukes boat etc.). Horribly short battle with KRONOS!

The beginning knocked off Hellboy 2 with the cutout flashback story telling and mechanical super bad thing powered by fire. Followed that up with a Harry Potter knock off. A crazy car that moves just like Weasleys car, ""driven"" by three witches that act just like the crazy double decker bus driver. After that we go to the Men in Black knock off, where all the employees of the coffee shop are mythical beings, versus the Post Office. Ah, now UPS converts to the ""Olympic Postal Service"", where once again, all employees are mythical. Don't think I want to finish watching it.

Once the terrible CGI bull, that never really had any explanation, came crashing through the gates of *Hogwarts* (excuse me), God America or whatever this place is called??, I wanted to get up and leave the theater. That's how bad the CGI looked. It doesn't get any better.

No, it doesn't look nearly as cool as Kurt Russell. Nuff' Said!** End Spoiler ** I'm not saying avoid this, but definitely avoid paying admission prices at theaters for this.

138,Mickeymauhead,Disappointed,1,3 September 2013,"This movie was alright, just definitely not what I expected to see. Though this movie may have been closer to the books, I completely disagree that it was better than the first one. I honestly didn't see much change in ""The Lightning Thief"" from the books, mostly details on how the characters were described in them. Now in the second movie, they did fix the differences of the characters in the books that were in th first movie. For kids who have read the books, this one was probably better since it was closer to the books, but it was VERY cheesy.All of the comedy felt really forced, For example when Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson come out of the taxi and Tyson says something like ""That... Was... Awesome! Let's do it again!"" honestly, to me, it was pathetic. One thing I was concerned about after the movie was when Kronos came out of the coffin and 'ate' Luke. That was unexpected, and it made me wonder how they were going to do the next movies if Luke was dead (Or not.) Even if he isn't dead, Kronos already went against him, and since the next books he is basically the body of Kronos, it makes me wonder what the directors will do. I won't be negative on the entire movie, since there was good action, the plot was creative and pretty clever, and ""Rainbow"" the hippocampus was beautifully done, very much how I imagined her/him in the books.

I think it was full of action and it had some great acting and directing work in it, not to mention the pretty amazing special effects, but one thing did bother me about the movie which is very unusual. Nobody dies or is going to die and you know it.I know it's a ""family friendly"" movie, but that doesn't mean nobody has to die or at least something 'sad' should happen? At least 5 times in this movie it seems like somebody is dead, but then they just magically rise from the death. Percy's brother falls into a river with a sword in his stomach, survives because he's a cycloph. Kratos rises from the death and eats someone, after they destroy him he's alive?! A friend of Percy gets stabbed by a monster, but off course they have another way of saving her (this time with the fleece). That scene was literally 1 minute. Suddenly they kill her, everyone cries, she comes back to life, everyone has their make-up back on and mooooving on. Even a person who was considered dead for years, because oh i don't know, she was a tree, came back to life because of that fleece (big 'old cliffhanger).The actors even mentioned in the film that with the Golden Fleece nobody will die, because they can just bring them back to life. It's like some kind of a cheat and it just takes away all the action.I enjoy happy endings, but a bit more emotion wasn't uncalled for, because you knew when somebody 'dies' in this movie, that person is just going to come back to life...",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

141,BuzzHanks,A Glimmer of Hope for The Film Franchise,8,15 January 2014,"This film shows what potential its franchise could have should it continue. It clearly demonstrates how a book adaptation should be: making it its own thing, while staying loyal to the essential elements of the series and maintaining continuity with the original film. Compared to the first film, this installment feels both more satisfying as an adaptation and also feels better as a solid movie overall. The first film was rather enjoyable, and had great ideas, but fell somewhat flat with a weak execution, and less passion in making it. HOW this movie ""fixes"" and improves upon the first film is in the following ways: A much more grounded and better polished script. The first film was perhaps hopeful to be thought of as more than its script. The structure and plot was thin and weak, and didn't feel as immersed as this film does. Here it feels like the film makers revised and mapped out what they wanted from the script instead of just seemingly writing the script over night without revisions. You get the sense that the filmmakers are passionate to get the writing right and make it make sense and enjoyable for those that haven't even seen the first film. To speak of that passion of presenting the series' world on film, there are many references made to various elements of Greek Mythology and to the series itself. Several story elements related to other stories in the series, those of which are quite similar to quests depicted in actual Greek Myths, are given a great discussion at the beginning of the film. The first film focused more on just trying to tell the basic needs without really expanding the world to its potential. As the film is titled Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, there is defiantly a ""sea"" full of monsters to be discovered in the movie, introducing monsters abounded from Greek myths, from a terrifying Charybdis, to a monstrous Polyphemus, among other cyclopeses, to less brutal creatures, such as a Hippocampus. Must amusing, ""Hercules Busts Heads"" is mentioned as a popular TV show, and appears as a brand name for a particular item needed for Percy & company to succeed in their quest.Percy's friend Grover (played by Brandon T. Jackson) is not annoying in this film like he was in the first film. This time he is more mature, yet still retains his comedic characteristics, not trying to be the center of attention, and acting more like he does in the novels with being a good cheer up when needed for when his best friend Percy is down. This, among other things, shows the writer's passion to tell what works, rather than just letting things go and not caring about what happens, assuming that the audience will just like it, or the theory that its other elements will help make the film great. The characters feel more like they do in the books, and despite the alterations made to scenes and the story, those changes all feel like something that could have happened in the books. They could have gone to a café with Demi God service. They could have gone to a place called Circe land (which actually fits the tone and concept of the universe better than the Polythemus land in the books, in that the concept of Mythology in a modern day setting is a combination of mythology and modern elements such as a theme park).If there are any faults within this film, it lies within the climax. While a genius idea to resurrect the Lord of the Titans, Kronos, to bring a more visual sense to the antagonist's goal, and the film's consequential stakes, the scene feels a little fast paced. One gets the resolve that Percy struggles throughout the movie about controlling one's destiny, though the scene feels a bit abrupt, seemingly wanting to get the event over and done with; having read the book, this is perhaps the most deviated scene from it, as Kronos does not physically appear like this until the final book. In an analysis, film is show, not tell, as this was Luke's (the film's antagonist), goal, and gives the film a more satisfying climax, bringing Percy to face his biggest worry and confrontate the inner battle he faces throughout the film, doubting whether he is good enough, or will just ruin things, rather than making a difference. Besides this climax's shortcomings, the film has clichés; nevertheless, they go along with the theme of the movie about changing destiny, no matter how certain things may seem. On the other hand, it is also a refresher to have these sorts of clichés as they remind one of the obvious morals in life that we often overlook, as we get older. As it is, the main characters in this film are teenagers, and these are the sorts of things that teenagers often go through, and it has to be portrayed in a simple way to not only differentiate itself from the recent serious teen drama on shows like Gossip Girl and One Tree Hill. Too, it is also to appeal to the fans of the books, where there the characters are even younger, and a lot of these ""clichés"" are either appealing, or are new to them.In short, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is a film that shows hope and potential for the series. While there are things to improve upon, the film shows what the franchise can become should it continue. It is by far one of the most satisfying adaptations I have ever seen, better than some of the Harry Potters. If the climax had been better paced, and if there had only been less clichéd dialogue (though that depends on one's knowledge of such), then the film would be a perfect redemption for the film series, though those things are sure to become bettered. ﻿",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

Luke also had a complicated childhood and backstory. In the movie this happened: Kronos (the titan more powerful then all the gods!) ate Luke and got killed by Percy in seconds.

The animation in this movie is really fake looking. Why is Luke back from the dead. He has a weird thingy that lets him travel places magically. Chiron can make an antidote for the poison in Thalia's tree. Annabeth has a tablet. Grover does not go on the quest for pan. Percy consults the Oracle, like in the first book and she tells him the the prophecy that he is not supposed to know. The Oracle is an anamotronic or really badly animated. Mr. D tells the. Where the fleece is. Tatalus is not there at all. Mr. D chooses a random satyr to go with Clarisse to get the fleece. Hermès does not tell them to go and give them stuff. Tyson wears sunglasses. Annabeth has mist in a bottle. Annabeth summons the gray sisters to get to Florida. They get dropped off in Washington. They get attacked in Washington by more demigods that have magic transport things and take Grover cause you can't find the the fleece without a satyr. He does give them the their gifts though, but one of them is a tape gun. They find the princess andromeda (which is a yacht) in Washington. They get captured by luke. Percy controls the water and gets them out of the boat. They use the magic tape gun. Percy can surf on waves. Annabeth tells Percy about why she doesn't like cyclops' while escaping the princess andromeda and don't end up in Florida. They go passed Charybdis before meeting Clarisse and their is no Scylla. They also end up in the stomach of Charybdis. They meet Clarisse in the stomach of Charybdis. They escape by shooting a whole in Charybdis' gut with a Cannon on the CSS Birmingham. Percy can see map lines on the water. They find Circe on the CSS Birmingham and Polyphemus lives under the island. Circe is also out of business. They ride on a roller coaster to get to Polyphemus. His island is not a paradise at all. Grover dresses like a chamber maid not his bride. Polyphemus is way to smart. He also has no sheep. He ate them all. No one pretends to be nobody. They trap Polyphemus in his cave and Luke shows up in the sea of monsters. Luke tries to shoot Percy with an arrow, Tyson blocks it and gets shot. They get captured by Luke again in circeland. Luke puts the fleece on Kronos' sarcophagus. They fight off Luke's demigods and Tyson comes back to fight them off too. Kronos reforms and eats Luke. Riptide helps him kill off parts of Kronos. Riptide was given to him by posiden who apparently killed Kronos originally. They kill Kronos. Luke also gets eaten by Polyphemus. Annabeth gets stabbed in the stomach. They use the fleece to heal her. Clarisse brings the fleece back to camp. Thalia does come back and Kronos is not gone for good. This was better than the first one but still terrible.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

146,Williambloody919,Sea of Monsters,8,1 October 2013,"I have read the book, well listened to it, it is good on Audio book. Sea of Monster book is different than the movie. However they were a lot younger in the book and basically they have to move everything quickly. I would like to see a Trilogy with Labrynth, Titan Curse and Last Olympian added to the mix, I will sit through LOTR So start making movies of a decent length I am still angry GOblet of Fire is the shortest length of Harry Potter movies barely making 2 hours.Tyson was good, not a baby Cyclopie, but at least someone decent. Stealing Grover to get the Golden Fleece was a but much, next time have him mission from the beginning and let Percy have his real quest.I will watch it again on the Big Screen and own it when it comes out on Itunes, and it better be soon I hate waiting because someone wants to save TAxes.Annabeth Hot, Clarriss Hot, but the hair, its nice and everything and you did it so that no one would get them confused on the screen, but Clarriss is better Blonde no offense and Annabeth is better Brown hair.They went to an Amusment part but there was no real pretend fun. Did Circe Cancel or something, it could have been a two for, Circe lures the children and the fleece the Satyrs, Cicres gets the girls for Sorcerer and Polythemus gets the rest to eat.I would have love to see someone use the No ONe Gag on him and see him run around looking scared searching. Nathan did a good job as Hermies. Kronus coming back to life was okay, it saves story letter at the end and a real person to defeat.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
147,junkyme,Critics are wrong as usual,9,13 August 2013,"Ill start off by saying I loved the movie, and recommend absolutely recommend it to fans and those who haven't read the book alike. I was saddened to read reviews saying how bland this was compared to Harry Potter (and sick to death of seeing it being compared to the series). The Percy Jackson series is not trying to be anything but Percy Jackson with it's own Greek myth influenced story, and it does it well.Of course there has been some omissions but that is expected from any book to big screen adaptation. The changes that they did, they tried to explain as best as possible I found, given what they had to work with. I think fans of the book wouldn't be too disappointed. And those that haven't read the book will find this a very entertaining follow-up to this much awaited sequel. Lets hope there will be a third to follow!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

149,kjetil-epland,Another stunning book about Percy Jackson,9,17 November 2013,"I'll give Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters a nine of ten. This movie did follow the main story, unlike Percy Jackson: The lighting thief, where Craig Titley wrote a completely new story. Percy and Annabeth has been transformed to have a look which is more like they appear in the books. But the circumstances around the things like they are sailing in a yacht and is being swallowed by Charybdis, is making the book so different from the movie as it can be. This movie does still got more of the book in it, than PJ #1.Despite all this negative writing, I loved both ""The lighting thief"" and ""Sea of monsters"", because all of the actors/actresses did a fabulous job, the story was great, and because it is more common to make movies about adult demigods. Therefore I loved ""Percy Jackson: Sea of monsters"". It's absolutely a movie worth watching. Can't wait for PJ #3.Camp Half-Blood",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
150,bogdaniosifaru,Disappointment of the summer,6,17 November 2013,"This is one the weakest movies I've seen this year. The story-line has a lame combination of Greek mythology combined with today life's. The movie sets its plot in a earthly environment, but also you soon realize that the location is from a different world. The things get more confused when you mystic characters searching from information using Ipads instead of a wizard liquid or equivalent. The combination between Greek god's world and today's is poorly realized by the producers and the result is a confusing movie made in a very strange way.But, the worst part of this movie is the computer graphics and animation. I've never seen such a poor originality's and poor work done by the movie crew. The sea effect has bunk images same like in the movies made in 70's.Big disappoint this movie.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
151,reneeraaijmakers,Messed up,3,3 November 2013,"As a total Rick Riordan fan I wasn't that happy about another Percy Jackson movie. Especially because the first one failed so miserable. Not including Kronos, and totally changing the story line kind off disappointed. I watched the first movie before reading the books and I thought it was okay, not great but okay. Now I understand you have to make up for a lot when you get a second chance, but how could you be this wrong. Kronos resurrecting at the end, total rubbish. And since when is the Princess Andromeda a yacht instead of a cruise ship?! Over all, I'm not that happy about the movie, it didn't include some stuff that was necessary, and if they are going to film the Titan's curse I hope it will be a lot better than the first two.So my conclusion, if you read the books, don't watch the movies. If you're not a reader, it is a nice movie to watch at home, preferably downloaded, because it's not worth your money.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
152,mitchie1999,Pretty Good,9,9 February 2015,"This film I think was a very entertaining and fast paced movie. I did not like the fact that the series went from being M rated in the first one to PG rated in the second, simply because it was made into more of a children's movie. Something that made the first movie great was that it was for a little more mature audience. I think that making this film into a children's movie didn't benefit at all which may have been why many of the more famous actors from the first movie did not want to be in the sequel. With that said I don't think that makes this movie bad, I think that it could have been slightly better. But overall I enjoyed the movie and hope that they keep the series going!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
153,joshua-701-554836,Not Worth the time taken to Watch.,4,11 November 2013,"I love the Percy Jackson books, and really looked forward to the Lightning Thief and Sea of Monsters. However, the two films are completely different in my eyes, and I think they couldn't have made them a weaker plot. If your expecting a film very y similar to the series then you are going to be very different. If you've read the books, the plots of the two films will feel very jumbled and out of order, and this makes it quite hard to understand the general gist of the film. However, if you haven't read the books, then you won't know any different and so it will be a fun movie to watch. Just don't base your decision on reading the books on this film, as it is not representative of the books' quality.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
154,Liltvic11,Nope not worth seeing ever,1,8 August 2013,"I did not see this movie in theaters I saw a few commercials and already noticed it was going to be different from the book again. What a shame someone really should send the books to the writers to show them what great works of literature they are ruining by creating these crappy films. I understand some may like it but in my opinion IT IS AWFUL AND A WATSE!!!!! I know I didn't see the movie but based on the first movie and how much they changed and left out they had no chance in making a second one. The commercials and clips from YouTube already show drastic changes and due to my relation on the first one I did not want to be screaming ""THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN"" or ""WHERE DID THEY GET THIS IDEA FROM"" or my favorite "" DID THEY EVEN READ THE BOOK!!!!"" For goodness sake they need to stop putting these crappy movies that are an embarrassment out into the public. They don't even get some Ancient Greek myths right which to me is a shame since they are so fascinating. I ask that you don't see this movie since they need to learn they shouldn't change the book so much. So I and hopefully some of you will avoid this movie there is many other great movies like Planes or We are the Millers. THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL, TERRIBLE, AND A WATSE!!!!!!! 0 out of 10 stars!! DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
155,miloandsequoia,We all loved it and were highly enteretained,10,8 August 2013,"We went to see this movie last night and loved it. I would say I almost prefer it to Harry Potter, because I really like Greek Mythology. We do not see movies often because I sometimes feel like they are not worth spending $60 for us all to go. But this was for sure worth it and I was glad we went.It had a lot of good action scenes, I liked the plot of the story and liked the special effects and monsters. I think Annabeth and Percy are cute and have good on screen chemistry, and I love that it was PG and kid friendly. The last few Harry Potters were not suitable for my kids ages and they will not be watching it until they are at least 8 or 9. Percy Jackson was good for even a 4 year old. A little scary at some parts, but not terribly violent or scary that I felt he should not be watching it. He was really excited about it and was asking me a ton of questions about the different things in the movie and was asking me to teach him about Greek Mythology before we left the theater.We LOVE it and will be paying to see any future ones and I really hope they make the rest of the books in to movies!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
156,melwanikush-761-264424,Boring! Ruins Book!!,5,9 August 2013,"I was really exited when I went to see this film. Now I hate myself. I read all the books before I saw the first film and I thought it was OK. But this movie was horrid! If you haven't read the books you might like it. It stayed closer to the book than the first but it was still FAR off. The special effects were horrible. I could have done a better job!! It went ON and ON!!! I was bored during the middle while they were in the Sea of Monsters. What they did at the end really upset me. ***SPOILERS*** Kronos is not supposed to come alive till the FIFTH BOOK!!! HOW MANY TIMES DOES Luke HAVE TO DIE!!!!???? They explained Luke coming back only by him saying ""You're not the only demigod who is hard to kill."" WHATTTTTT!!!?????? The Mist thing made NO SENSE WHATSOEVER!! They kept on killing then reviving people. There was no point. Luke has now died 3 times in two films. URGGGGGGGGG I really want them to leave Percy alone and stop ruining the books. They should wait to make a reboot. But there was one thing that hurt and annoyed me the most... NO PERCABETH!!!!!(Percy and Annabeth romance) what is wrong with these people! I gave this 5/10 because there was some scenes that were... interesting. Overall- If you liked the first one and haven't read the books, go see it. If you've read the books, i advise you not to.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
157,ratchet567,Could have been better,7,30 December 2013,"Let me begin by saying that I never really hated the first movie. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. I also saw the first movie before reading any of the books, but now that I have it really just kills the movies for me. First, the movie strayed way too far from the book in my opinion. The beginning was okay, but as it progressed, especially towards the end, it just fell apart (uh, Kronos? you're not supposed to be here.) That being said, it still was a sizable improvement from the first. The movie was casted well (Nathon Fillion!) and the plot was good. Another thing I will point out is the special effects, they were incredible. One CGI scene when Percy was with the Oracle was very good, even if it didn't stick to the mythology. some of the acting was just plain bad (sorry Annabeth but you need to get better at being in distress) and honestly I just cant see how they can make the rest of the books into movies after this. In conclusion, if you're a person who hated the first movie because it didn't stick to the book then you will not like this, but if just like the movies in general (or never read the books) this is definitely something I recommend you see.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
158,laura_t-768-146288,Better than excepted!,8,18 August 2013,I just watched the movie and I loved it so much. I think it was better then the first one and it had more action and some sad scenes I cried. But it was really good and I just can say watch it. You will not repent it. I swear! It was really exciting! So I just can hope when there's coming a next one it will be as good as that. I didn't read the books but I think I'm actually start to read them because the movies are amazing and normally I think the books are better. So read the books watch the movie. It's amazing. I watched it in 3D. I don't like it that much but it was really good! But I think there was no part in the movie that was boring. I listened to every single word and it really wasn't boring. But there some scenes you first have to think about it that you actually can understand. Altogether it was really really good!,Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
159,urockband,Entertaining Film,7,19 September 2013,"To start off, it was a really great movie that never failed to keep me entertained. There were, however; some bad aspects of this movie. The acting was well above average, though some characters came off as a bit corny in some of the dialogue that I believed could be said in a much better way or expression to tone down the corniness.I have not read the books so I cannot judge how the characters portrayed their book counterparts but I will take the word of many reviewers on this title and agree with them on this issue. But, even without reading the books I couldn't imagine a better set of young actors for the roles. The actress who played ""Clarisse"" - Leven Rambin, mostly caught my eye with her acting. She was superb in the role as Clarisse and every scene she did was great.Some moments or events in the movie were fairly predictable. And the idea of the movie seemed to follow every other film in the ""The Main Characters never die""...The sad moments in the movie were immediately changed to bring happiness to the audience but in my opinion, I would like a little tragedy in such films.A boy, the son of Poseidon, faces a quest to help save his home. The antagonist made such a brief appearance in the film and the problem was dealt with fairly easily. Almost, too good that there wasn't such big trouble going against the ""evil boss""...But I am sure we haven't seen the end of him. I am anxiously waiting for the next movie as the story is simply great, exciting, and entertaining.I just went today to see this movie in the theater and I actually came out of the movie feeling pretty satisfied and not at all disappointed. I chose this movie over The GetAway and I was glad I made the choice considering the rating and reviews I saw for that movie.In summary: The actors were great, the dialogue was good except for some corny parts that definitely needed a look over. The story is simply perfect and the whole rating of the movie was good. You would love this movie if you really liked the first part. Definitely a Film Series worth watching.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
160,jramirez17,Awful,1,22 November 2013,This movie in my opinion was better then the first but still as bad. 1- For starts we find ourselves in the beginning of the movie with the story of how Thalia became a tree. We're not supposed to know that until later on in the movie. 2- They decide to change Alexandra Daddario hair to blond thinking we wouldn't notice and forget that in the first her hair is brown. 3- Luke's ship is a yacht not a cruise ship in the book it's a cruise ship full of monsters. 4- Tantalus does not appear and Chiron is not fired. 5- Chronos does not come back for a moment in the book so why bring him back here. 6- We don't see Circe's island and that is very important if they plan on making a movie out of The Heroes of Olympus because Reyna mentions Percy and Annabeth destroying it. 5- The Prophecy in the book says he will save olympus at the age of 16 not f***ing 21. 6- Silena Bouregaurd is outed as a traitor. 7. Percy doesn't hear The Great Prophecy until the last book. 8.Grover is searching for Pan and is not in the movie until they rescue him and in some dreams but in this movie there is no mention of Pan at all and he is with them at the beginning of the quest. 9. Annabeth is killed by the Manticore. This is bullshit she does not die ever in the book she is just wounded by Polyphemus.God of Olympus why are the directors of these movies idiots the movies are terrible do not watch it if you are a fan of the books.,Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

My mum fell asleep in the cinema because it was too boring. I felt that the first movie was much better than this... crap. The plot was horrible, build up was slow, and the climax only lasted for 3 minutes. Cyclops and Clarisse did a great job of annoying me throughout the whole movie.Kronos was defeated with a pathetic stab by Percy's sword when it took Zeus, Poseidon and Hades to take Kronos down.

After watching said movie, I nearly snapped the disk in half and threw it out the window. It was a complete insult to an amazing set of books, for Hollywood to bring out such a crappy movie. The cast members were all much too old. The campers were meant to be mid teenagers. Percy, Annabeth and Grover were only meant to be 12. Instead, all the campers looked about 20. Another thing, Annabeth is a BLONDE!!! UGH! I was so disgusted with this movie, I didn't think the studio had the balls to make a second one. But of course, they did. I was hoping it would be much better. It was, but only slightly. I was still appalled at the story-line and quality of these movies. I really wish the studio would start from scratch. They should start again from the Lightning Thief, with younger actors that look more like the characters, and a closer story-line and setting to the book.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

I admit it is a lot better than first attempt but still can be a lot better. Good thing about it is that they picked good cast crew but still the problem which remains is the story is not complete, doesn't include some good scenes from books. I don't even know why kronos got resurrected here, it just producers are trying to rush things too much. There is no point in that, you just end up with a bad movie. Also when they resurrect him fine, titan is alive the destroyer of world, and just dies in a minute, i mean, really? i though he would be a bit harder to kill than that... Maybe for those who didn't read book this movie looks appealing but when you know how story should go and how it went, it's just awkward.

The characters were made to be super cheesy too, and not at all like they are in the books. It was so incredibly predictable I can't believe people actually liked watching this. The fight scenes were insanely terrible, and no one died!! That is the part that really gets me. Like 3 times they made you think someone was dead but HOLY CRAP they always ended coming back to life some way or another. The special effects were okay, but nothing I haven't seen before.

Fans are rooting for the happening of The Titan's Curse...so bring it on and stay faithful to the book please. The effects were really well done and the music was awesome. In total it's a must see movie. Logan Lerman was great at playing Percy and Alexandra Daddario was amazing and truly revealed her talent in acting. No negative reviews.

Just like the first movie, I love the books so obviously I felt most of the Greek myth part wasn't enough at all.....The basic part of this movie is so Hollywood, which leads the scene and plot so limited, containing just like 30 percent of the plot from the original book.The part I disliked so much was the Kronis looking so cheap and ridiculous, I was kind of disappointed that these movie direcktors decided to cut CG expenses or something on the most important scene...But maybe if you don't know any background of the myth, its ok to watch this.I'll give 7 because I am wishing someday they will make the third movie with a better plot and more details of the Greek myth part, more faithfully.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
173,abraham-abeach,A decent sequel,7,6 August 2013,"Keying in my first review in IMDb after watching a premiere show for the first time.Percy Jackson: Sea Monsters is a decent effort as a sequel to the lighting thief. It is not entirely necessary to watch the first part to watch. The story is good on its own. However I did notice that there were many dialogs just out of line. The script might have over worked to make it humorous.The visual effects are not up to the mark overall but some places are pretty sweet and worth watching in 3D otherwise the depth is not that great. With that one can easily notice work of CG in not so important parts of the movie.The actors have done well and delivered the script good that the subtle jokes and wits were understood and 95% effective. I was pretty much impressed by the actress in the lead and supporting roles than the men.Overall, the movie is a good watch but not a great effort. If you really into 3D movies, I would watch in on the big screen with the expectation some weakness in CG. Otherwise I would wait for BluRay. I give it a 7 of 10.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
174,dannydean84,This movie makes book look like the greatest story ever told,1,8 August 2013,"Without saying any spoilers I will tell you why you must not pay a penny or a cent to see this movie unless you want to demand your money back like I did today. First, if you have read the book do not expect a similar plot. I enjoyed the Percy Jackson stories, and their sequels the Heroes of Olympus series as reasonable light reading an I believe Rick Riordan is a rather gifted story-writer for teenagers. The film does contain a similar plot but with all the best bits removed or ruined through trashy scriptwriting to try and gain the attention for teenage Paris Hilton wannabes. The story, meaning to follow it's predecessor had to be re-scripted because all the characters are getting old now. The acting is below par by the supposedly teenage actors if most of the time you can call it acting. The greatest travesty to acting is firstly Leven Rambin who plays Clarisse who obviously knew nothing of the role which she had to portray. Brandon T. Jackson is as bad at playing Grover, usually for laughs, in this film as in it's prequel. I'm surprised he was not recast. Some of the special effects we of a reasonable standard even with 3D but there was no 'WOW' factor. However, the further it got into the film and the worse the plot, jokes, and deviation from a well-told story it got, the more I wanted to cringe and face-palm myself into oblivion. In the end I walked out and got a free ticket for The Wolverine in 3D from my local cinema. This one will be film guaranteed to put to smile to my face. The shame is I enjoyed the books and even after seeing Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief I hoped that with a new director the plot would be more on par with the original story. I wanted this film to be a good one so much and now sadly I am disappointed beyond my worst thoughts.Every film-goer accepts that a film can never be the book on screen due to the imagination of reader getting in the way but at least they could have attempted to produce the same story. I was willing to allow huge changes to take place as long as the story was enjoyable. Sadly I believe the screenplay writer and director should be executed for crimes against cinema. Finally after decades of searching I think I may finally have found my own personal worst film.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

Luckily my daughter insisted that we view this. I am so glad we did. It was terrific! I think the poor reviews were so unfair. This isn't the best movie in the world but it was very entertaining. There were some plot changes from the book but it didn't bother us. I would have liked to see more action in actual ""sea of monsters.""

I know that they're looking for the fleece to the bermuda triangle, but the journey seems too easy, they need more obstacles, more enemies. and why the hell the daughter of god of war hate percy so badly, just because percy saved olympus or what? the way they present it are lame.this movie definitely suitable for children only, don't expect for awesome fight scenes, well i don't know what kind of fight scenes good for this movie, typical fight scene with a lot of kicks and punches? or the fight using their ""magical"" power?",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
177,Lilia_Montoya,"Movie OK, adaptation to the story... blah",4,14 December 2014,"The movie itself is not that bad... but the adaptation from the book itself is so far away from what its original story development that it really distracts you from enjoying the movie...So if you love the books and the way they go about the adventures of Percy Jackson, this will not be very rewarding. And in my case (because I read the book so long ago) it made me wondered if I got confused and had to read the book all over again (and enjoyed the book all over again, so for that I am grateful)If you haven't read the book, then this movie will be fine as a sequel to the first one... all in all, a 4 out of 10The book is full of adventures and plots, twists and turns, the movie has maybe 3.

178,ravitejajnv,Total Disaster,2,18 November 2013,"Honestly my imagination is way better than this movie experience, a couple of my friends felt the same way. This movie is a big disaster, particularly for the fans who've read the books. The movie never felt like integrated, it was more like a bunch of badly directed scenes. The story was twisted like crazy. The director can take a leaf out of the movie Hobbit where the original story was preserved like never before, and it was beautiful.Even the bad and gigantic Cyclops like Polyphemus can't make much of an impression.I hope next movie would be directed by someone who actually read the book and preferably a fan.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
179,hastebahar,A Complete Embarrassment,4,9 August 2013,"If you haven't read the books, the review is not for you. This movie is enjoyable and entertaining for an action movie, and there are funny parts as well as suspenseful parts. If you have read the books, however, here you go. I'm just going to cut straight to the point here - this movie was a joke. From the acting to the attempt to bring Rick Riordan's world to life, everything was wrong. So wrong, in fact, that after the movie finished I sat there in stunned silence thinking, ""That's it?"". I didn't go in this movie with high expectations since the first movie was such a disaster. However, I thought that since Annabeth's hair was blonde and the trailer looked promising, this movie would be at least better than the first one. I was wrong. Let's just start with the actors; the only two that impressed me with their performances were Leven Rambin as Clarisse and Stanley Tucci as Mr. D. Even though Leven didn't look the part, her sarcasm and fieriness matched the Clarisse in the books. Mr. D was perfect, I only wish he had been in the first movie. The rest of the actors were either horrible or just mediocre. Logan Lerman was a bore as Percy, barely able to be the witty smart-aleck from the books. Brandon T. Jackson was simply a comedic relief and nothing else. I saw none of Grover's personality in him. Douglas Smith, while a good actor by himself, didn't play the Tyson I imagined. He was smart, spoke clearly, and was even attractive with two eyes. Come on Thor Freudenthal, can you cast anyone who isn't remotely good-looking? The worst was Alexandria Daddadrio. She conveyed no emotion, her lines were monotone, and the way she played the damsel-in-distress, Percy-obsessed girl was so unnatural. Since when is Annabeth the one who needs saving? Anyways, I know that book-to-movie adaptations are incredibly hard to cast, so pushing aside the disappointments with that, lets just go to the storyline. The beginning was good. I thought it was sensible, for time's sake, to cut out the whole dodge ball game at the beginning of the book and introduce Tyson in another way. The flashback to the original trio was good, the bull fight was just how I imagined it, but Grover shouldn't have been there. He should've been already away, looking for Pan. I don't understand why they had to have him in camp; this was honestly such a simple thing they could've done to please the fans. Chiron's exile from the camp was also a simple touch they could've added. Once they go on the quest however, everything turns into a big mess. Grover getting captured by Luke? Finding Clarisse in the stomach of Scylla? All of a sudden, Clarisse is agreeing with everything Percy says? Then, the most disappointing part of all, the entire Circe's island scene was skipped along with the siren scene, which was a major development point for Percy and Annabeth's relationship (but I guess they don't need any development since they had them almost kissing at the end of The Lightning Thief). The dramatic and highly unnecessary amusement park scenes with Luke were so ridiculous they had me laughing. Why did Kronos come out in his full form, and why on Earth was Percy able to defeat him with a simple slash of his sword? That made no sense at all and I'm sure that even non-book readers would be confused at how a sword, even a ""cursed sword"" could immediately defeat the most powerful Titan with one cut. Also, has nobody realized that the Iris message has been completely ignored in this movie and the previous? Why leave out a form of communication so vital to the books? Lastly, something that wasn't necessary but would've added a lot more comedy to the movie than Grover's lame one-liner's were the ""party ponies"" who rescue Percy at the end. The reviving of Thalia was well done, although I don't understand Clarisse and Percy's sudden bonding. In the books, those two hate each other for all five books, and I can never remember them exchanging a smile or an understanding nod. In conclusion, I felt almost as though the director was trying to stray as far as the book as possible. Why couldn't they have curled Annabeth's hair, had Tyson have slow and slurred speech, added the search for Pan to the story, and so many other little things that may have made up for the scene skipping and melodramatic almost- deaths. If you love the books, I say stay as far away from this movie as possible, unless you want to go home with a yearn to reread the entire series just to remind yourself of the characters and story and get the awful portrayal out of your mind. That's all I have to say.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
180,peters-180-59076,Review for Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,2,2 September 2013,"I am a fan of sci-fi and fantasy movies. I never write reviews unless the movie is exceptional or a disaster. In either case you really have to motivate me to write a review (it's been about 2 years). Conventional reviews give this movie a pass, 50/50 so to speak. Honestly though this film is terrible. It could have been so much more; the plot and transition from scene to scene is discombobulated, confusing and nonsensical. Special effects are mediocre and the integration of the special effect into the action scenes are not well thought or played out. If you have read the book my suggestion is DO NOT see this movie. It will ruin the book for you.There is a technique to merging real-world to fantasy/sci-fi and this was a complete failure. Kenneth Charles Branagh should stick to historical themes and drama/thrillers and shy away from sci-fi and fantasy movies. Kenneth you have a lot to prove to this viewer.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
181,hampton-patrick,The ball was dropped on an amazing potential for a sequel.,6,7 August 2013,"As a fan of films. I will say this. The film didn't leave me bored and kept me in gauged the whole time. After seeing the first one a while ago it seems like they relied to much on it to progress this story forwards. And the title kind of made me mad. Their is barley anything to do with sea monsters! So much potential that was lost with the mishandling of the Mythos. The biggest flaw I saw was they really didn't play to their strengths. As I loved the Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) in the first one. Her character was just lost in this movie. Even though he had probably one of the most genuine scenes in the whole movie. The things that made me want to watch the first one again were lost from its sequel. There were many key things missing to make this film great. The miss direction in the title, lost key characters, the story was a bit weak, and some of the acting was OK. SFX are great, fight sequences are fun but thats the only reasons I would tell someone to see this film.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
182,hannajane-p,If you're a fan of the books spare yourself from feelings of rage 4/10,4,7 August 2013,"Even if you completely disconnect yourself from the book I still doubt that you would enjoy this movie very much. It's all over the place and hard to follow, despite the shallowness of every single character. I didn't feel like I could connect to any one of them throughout the entire movie (I will be comparing the movie to the book quite a bit), and while reading the books I felt like one of the characters myself. Of course I didn't expect for there to be depth like the book, but I had some very small expectations what with there being a new director than the first movie. Oh, they changed Annabeth's hair to blonde!! Franchise saved! No. Here are a few things that were plain wrong:  When they first enter the Sea of Monsters, Percy tells Annabeth that his powers don't work with that water. Later, when Tyson falls into the river (still in the sea of monsters) he returns saying the water healed his wound.  And what was up with Tyson? Perfectly literate and really not bad looking with both his eyes. Can't Hollywood EVER make an important character look less than perfect?  I think we all wanted to see Percy turn into a Guinea pig on the big. That was personally my favorite part of the book.  Annabeth. She's just wrong.  Clarisse was pretty? And thin? And actually nice?  The explanations at the beginning of the movie were good, I must admit, especially considering the lack of them in the first movie, but it ended up working against the movie. They spend so much time trying to make up for the first movie with the details being explained (i.e. mist, little Annabeth running away, general camp activities, introducing Mr. D and Clarisse) that the actual quest and main plot were ridiculously rushed. The end scene was such a huge disappointment.  Luke is dead then...? If there is supposed to be another movie they might as well remove the 'based on the novel by Rick Riordan' because it will be too far gone.  Talia was supposed to older when she died and that same age when she woke.  Since when was Annabeth such a damsel in distress? She was the most BA character in all the books. In general there were a lot of problems with storyline continuity. I'm rating it a four instead of a two because, well, I like Logan Lerman. The beginning was good and kind of similar to the book, and there were a few laughable lines. Other than that, it's a failed attempt at bringing such an incredible book to the big screen. Is it worth a 10 dollar 3D ticket? No. If you really want to see it, wait for it to come out on DVD.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
183,hashemegzozegzoz,Much better than the first movie,10,2 September 2013,"I loved this film so much better than the first one. I felt the first movie left a lot of key plot points out, but this movie brought some things in without making the movie seem jumbled. Sea of Monsters starts by telling the story of how Talia, Luke, and Annabeth came to camp half blood. It also brings in the characters Tyson and Clarisse. Granted, the way they brought in Tyson wasn't exactly how they did it in the books, I thought that they did it in the best way possible considering the first film. In the books, Tyson was a classmate of Percy's, but in this one, they brought him in to help Percy's confidence, which he needed, and also brought in the story of the great prophecy. I understand some people were looking for the movies to be an exact replica of the books on film, but I didn't expect that. Ad I don't think anyone should. The majority of the the characters were there, the basic storyline was there, and I thought that they brought the Kronos and Talia story lines in very well to make a cohesive and fun movie. The special effects were great to me, especially the hippocampus (I know there were supposed to be three of them, but the one they did have was impressive enough). I definitely encourage people to not rely too heavily on anyone's opinion (even mine) and go see and enjoy this movie.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
184,mahamalamgir1,Not too shabby,7,25 July 2014,"So I just finished watching it and being an avid Percy Jackson reader, I was okay with it. The girl who played Clarisse did an amazing job though I wished she maybe have looked more buff or just the part that Riordan described in the book. Yay Diddario got blonde hair BUT Annabeth I wished had a bit more attitude and sarcasm with Percy and was more independent, because that's what really made me ship them, that Annabeth would act all sassy towards Percy but you know that they both really loved each other. <3 Moving on, I wished they had a bit more of the Monsters that were in the book like the Sirens. Overall though, especially if you didn't read a book, it was action packed and Logan Lerman is awesome! I probably will watch the third movie and the ending was a good way of providing that.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
185,cawleyjack73,A perfect recipe for a terrible movie,3,10 August 2013,"I just watched this movie earlier, and I did go into the movie screen expecting not a lot as I hated the first one.*NON-SPOILER* The first thing I noticed in the movie was the terrible CGI, that stuck out like a sore thumb among the background. And the next thing I noticed was the mediocre acting, worsened by the dozens of cheesy, humorless and cheesy one-liners throughout the movie.*SPOILER* The story was downright predictable also, as it ended as most generic action/adventure movies ended, the bad guy releasing they had done bad and the main character killing the main baddie.*NON-SPOILER* The only good thing in this movie I could think about was the locations the characters found themselves in. The locations ranged from cities, to woods to the middle of the ocean.The main character, Percy Jackson is supposed to be the half-blood son of Poseidon (a water god) and barely uses water AT ALL throughout the movie to his advantage. *SPOILER* And an even particularly silly scene where they are about to be swallowed by a large water monster thing, the water powers Percy has don't actually 'work'.All in all, this movie is a complete waste of money, complete with cheesy one-liners, boring story, tedious acting and just an all-over negative viewing experience.3/10",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

We have been talking about going to see this movie for roughly 6 months and although there may be some differences between the movie & the book (aren't there almost always differences between the movie & the book?) he really enjoys the movies. Go see the movie as it is a different type of entertainment than reading & the changes that are made give you something to discuss with your friends whether you be heading back to school or talking w/ friends in the office.

187,abes3933,"Nope, Nope, Nope.",1,28 August 2013,"Just for the record, I have read all the books multiple times and I understand that the movie won't follow the book completely.But they could at least follow the story line a bit more.So, the beginning of the movie starts out at camp. I actually didn't mind the very, very beginning of the movie. I thought it was fun. It all went downhill from there.The next few scenes slightly follow the book in a way that it is good enough to pass.Then you get to the oracle where Percy learns his destiny. THEY DIDN'T EVEN FOLLOW THE MYTHOLOGY! They said that Cronos swallowed all of his kids EXCEPT Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Then they chopped him up. Those who don't know, he swallows all of his kids except Zeus who is taken away until he's old enough to trick his father into throwing up all of his kids and they - depending on the version - castrate, or chop up their father.They then proceeded that at the demigod's 20th birthday (I can't complain too much, Logan Lerman can't pass as a thirteen year old) he shall either save or destroy Olympus.Setting out on the quest, to save Thalia's tree, with Annabeth, Tyson AND Grover, who we know is in Polyphemus' lair, stalling their marriage. Grover is kidnapped and sent to Polyphemus who we later see, slightly following the book, dressed as a woman, pretending to be a maid. They don't know where Luke is, who is the one who captured Grover, so they go to see his Dad, Hermes, at the Demigod post office.They learn he's on a boat, they leave, find the boat, and they're stuck. When they do escape, they go into the sea of monsters and get swallowed by the first monster they come by in the book. Meeting Clarisse down there. They escape together and finally get to an island.In the book, Polyphemus lives on a nice island that has green grass and is completely healthy, thanks to the fleece. You've got the flesh-eating sheep and all that jazz. In the movie, they get to the island that is an abandoned amusement park. They go down this roller coaster for a few seconds until they get stopped by rocks, which marks the entrance to Polyphemus' lair. Fast forward, they have the fleece, and locked Polyphemus into he lair with a boulder. They meet Luke and his men, including Selena Beauregard (I might not have spelt that right) who practically saves the day in the fifth book, and they shoot Tyson who falls into a chasm. Finally, they're tied up and Luke uses the fleece to revive Cronos. He succeeds and Cronos swallows Luke and Grover. Percy's blade saves the day and they put Cronos back in the coffin. Grover is back and Luke is thrown into Polyphemus' cave where we assume he's eaten.Annabeth is stabbed and she dies. Then is revived by the fleece. Tyson is back and they head back where the camp is waiting.The rest makes sense, they go back to normal life, but alas, Thalia has been healed and is back.I hope to god they don't make another movie. There isn't a way for them to make another one and still have the same outcome that they have in the book unless they do some crazy thing that barely passes for OK. I don't know what Rick Riordan was thinking when he helped - if he helped - with the making of this movie. DO NOT SEE IT IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK. It's a waste of money and time.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
188,kbudde10,No movie follows the book exactly,10,15 August 2013,I went to see this movie with my friends and I loved it!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!- So I have read the book and Yes parts are changed and some parts aren't there but i mean if every part was there then this movie would have to be like 4 hours and so they did compromises and for me I liked what they did better in the movie for example I like how Grover was with them and then got taken instead of being taken throughout the whole book. Also I how they meet up with Clariss in the movie better. Also I love the boat scene better in the movie so yeah its different but sometimes different is a good thing and if you don't like change then just pretend its a different movie than the book.- One of my favorite scenes was the beginning with Percy and that obstacle course I loved it and that wasn't in the book so you see sometimes its better to be different then the books you just have to give it and change and you can't except everything to be exactly the same. I love the movie and i really hope they continue with the series!!!!

But, as a hardcore fan of the books, I welcome death with open arms. Let's just say we'll forget the fact that grover (like all satyrs) is off looking for Pan (The god of the wild) and pretend he's right at camp half blood forever. Let's pretend that Clarisse is a beautiful girl, whom in the end enjoys the company of Percy Jackson. No sirens, no calypso, no island when guinea pigs happen, no monster donut hydra, no calling the hippocampi ""Rainbow"", no party ponies and definitely no hydra. Kronos appears, ya know, fully formed. He decides to call Riptide the ""cursed blade"" from the prophecy. Ya know, cus that's a thing. They just point out Selena Beauregard on Luke's yacht. Let's just ruin the last book/movie. Basically, if you've read the books- run in the other direction as fast as you can.But, ya know, at least Annabeth is blonde- right? Anyway- just take the ""kind of"" out of ""Kind of want to die"" and here we are.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
190,stphie,Book vs Film: In Defence of the Percy Jackson Films,10,7 October 2013,"I enjoyed the Percy Jackson films so much that I decided to write my first ever IMDb review.I only saw 'The Lightning Thief' for the first time a few months before 'Sea of Monsters'. It came on TV while I was eating lunch and within the first 10 minutes, had me hooked. Afterwards, I was shocked at the negative reception it had been given online.Imagine my absolute thrill when I realized 'Sea of Monsters' was scheduled to be released and I only had to wait a couple of months! SOM was everything the first one was and more - full of action, adventure, humor and most importantly, fun! Still, there are many saying these are terrible movies. They have great acting, a good script and CGI on par with the Harry Potter films - what's not to like? The Percy Jackson movies are not trying to win Oscars. It's simply a fun, entertaining film and that's all it is trying to be. (One could argue they are also educational in terms of Greek Mythology!)It seems to come down to the Percy Jackson Books versus Films. Many who read the series before seeing the movie are extremely critical of it. I read the first book AFTER the first movie, and the second book BEFORE the second movie. Yes, there are differences. Did reading the book before the second movie ruin my enjoyment? No way! It was great to see how they portrayed many of the scenes and interesting to see how they adapted or changed others. Rather than tearing apart what was different, why not focus on the scenes from the book that came alive so accurately on the screen? (Thalia's tree, the mechanical bull, the blind taxi drivers.) I was furious at some changes made in the Harry Potter films (still am!), but I never let it affect my overall enjoyment of their adaption.I am desperately hoping they will announce the third Percy Jackson movie has been given the go ahead! These are the closest thing to having Harry Potter back on the big screen.I'm currently reading the third book and am intending now to read the whole series. Working in a library, I can say that the interest in the books has certainly picked up as well. I strongly believe if someone who never would have picked up these books is buying or borrowing them to read (just like myself), then these movies must be doing something right. Please make them all!",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
191,ciocolata_dementa,Disappointment,5,22 April 2018,"Just like others said: the movie has nothing to do with the books!

193,moonbane-hunter,and the worst movie adaptation of a book award goes to...,3,28 August 2013,"this movie is so ridiculous it contains almost nothing from the book, they should give the title character a new name and make it jersey Thompson and the sea of monsters because other than the character's name and the basic story line there is nothing in the movie that is common with the book. Clarisse is not the one selected for the quest for golden fleece in the book but miraculously she appears in the second movie without any mention about her in the first one and goes on the quest and then gets stuck on a ship with ""Zombies"" in the Sea of monsters. There is nothing about sirens and Circe's island or Percy turning into hamster in the movie. Also the part where Percy deceives the cyclops don't bother looking for it because its not there. Oh there is also an epic battle between Cronus who is a giant robot like thing and Percy where Riptide is the cursed blade and in this battle Percy defeats Kronos, a Titan and slices him into two pieces like he is a piece of cake. The oracle tells him about the prophecy and even that is not accurate. Then when you think it cant get any worse, it does. Thalia is alive and guess what, she grew up and became a teenager when we thought she was busy being a tree and dead and all. Can you believe that 10 year old Thalia dies and reappears as 17 year old Thalia.The only thing i liked about this movie was Nathan Fillion as Hermes and Logan Lerman as Percy.

194,mars_0103,All in all entertaining,8,10 August 2013,"The film was a good adaptation of the book. It had funny bits in, a nod to firefly and Anthony Head in it (loads better than Pierce Bronson). The film starts with a action scene showing the growth of Percy. The film doesn't have any slow parts in my opinion.There are two main issues with the film that fans of the books will pick out. One is the fact that Percy has not shown his ability to talk to horses or sea life. The second thing is on the andromada that will make the other adaptation of the films more difficult to keep on track with the books.In conclusion the film is a must for kids will keep them entertained for the length of the film.

195,Canadian_Haggis,Hoping for the next movie,7,10 August 2013,"I love the Percy Jackson books, it's one of my favourite book series. Thought the first film was alright, but a mediocre version of the books. When I heard that there was going to be a second one, I was very skeptical that it would work considering the number of bad changes they've done to the Lightning Thief. But once I learned that screen writers Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski were hired to adapt it (who aren't credited for some reason), I began to feel hopeful for the Sea of Monsters. Alexander and Karaszewski had previously worked on the bio-pics Ed Wood, The People vs. Larry Flynt, and Man on the Moon. I thought that they'd look up the books and do justice to Percy Jackson.Just came back from seeing it and I really like it, thought it was better than The Lightning Thief. I didn't think that it was a great film, some of the dialogue felt awkward to me, but overall I had fun and felt some justice was done. Yes, there was some changes made to the Sea of Monsters but nothing as bad as the previous film. I enjoyed watching Stanley Tucci (Mr. D), Anthony Stewart Head (Chiron), and Ron Perlman (Polyphemus).

198,mechanodroid,Sea of Monsters exceeds expectations in ways The Lightning Thief did not,8,10 August 2013,"*ATTENTION-there will be minor spoilers in this review Let me start off by saying I had great expectations for this film. I enjoyed The Lightning Thief, but I recognized that it wasn't exactly the most faithful adaptation of the book. In fact, many fans voiced their intense displeasure with the film. I went into this movie hoping for a better adaptation, and that is exactly what I got. Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is a better film in almost every way than its predecessor.Most of the main cast returns from the previous film. Unfortunately, Pierce Brosnan is replaced by Anthony Head as Chiron, one of the directors of Camp Half Blood. Stanley Tucci and Nathan Fillion join the cast as Dionysus and Hermes respectively. Although they are supporting characters, they steal the show in the scenes they are in.The story itself is based on the one from the book, which in turn is based on Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece. The heroes Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson are sent on a quest to retrieve the Fleece to save a dying tree in the camp. This tree provides protection to the camp and without it, all of the campers would be in danger. The story is well adapted, for the most part. Fans of the book will not be disappointed.There are some differences however. For example, in the book, the Chariot of Damnation appears to life the heroes from the streets of New York to Camp Half Blood at the beginning of the story. In the film, it takes them from Camp Half Blood to D.C.Although there are few changes, there is also a surprising amount of detail that the director put in for fans of the book. One example is the ""Hercules Busts Heads"" thermos, which is taken straight from the pages of the book. Another is the inclusion of minor character Chris Rodriguez, a member of Luke's seafaring crew. It was small details like these that had me smiling throughout the film and shows that the production team really knew their source material.The film is by no means perfect. The special effects in the film are very hit-and-miss. In some scenes, it was very clear that the monsters were not actually in front of the actors. In others, however, it looked quite convincing. Also, some of the acting was not up to par. Logan Lerman did great as Percy, Brandon T. Jackson (Grover) was top notch, even Doug Smith (Tyson) portrayed a believable (although a bit different from the book) young Cyclops. The same cannot be said for Alexandra Daddario (Annabeth). Her performance was pretty stiff. I know that in the novel, she was in a pretty bad mood for most of the quest, but there was just something missing in her performance.Jake Abel (Luke Castellan) suffered from a similar problem. In the first film, he was a relaxed, happy guy who just kind of turned at the end. In this film, he is overly serious and has a permanent frown. It's almost like a totally different character.If you are a fan of the book, I highly recommend you see this film. If you were disappointed with The Lightning Thief, this one will restore your faith in the series. It may not be perfect, but it is definitely a huge improvement and a step in the right direction for the series.If you have not read the series and only saw the first one, go out and watch this one too. You will love it. If this movie makes enough money, The Titan's Curse will be green lit. Go see this film! 8/10",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
199,erictwedell,"Great movie, and fun to watch!",10,12 August 2013,"The world has never seen a Cyclops before this movie that was done as well. Just for this fact alone, I would say go see the movie already! I would watch it again most definitely for many other reasons, and if you are not cynical about CGI, you will like this! Seriously, this movie was one of the best, most entertaining films I have seen in the past 10 years. Yes, and I love watching all kinds of movies, so I hope you will listen to me and that you will go see it. Trust me that because of CGI, much of the action is not believable (I only believe in one God anyways) but that aside, this movie was FUN and the CGI effects were AWESOME to watch! I think that it had so many elements that were interesting that you will like it a lot, and maybe find yourself wanting to read the books, too.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
200,tickledgiraffe,I despise these movies and they do the books NO justice,1,12 August 2013,"OK, so to ANYONE who saw the Sea of Monters, can you honestly tell me that after Percy is crushed by Kronos, Annabeth's reaction is NOT the worst piece of acting you've ever saw? I mean, the movie as a whole sucked, not following the books in the slightest, but that one shot was just SO horrible.So yes, I despised this movie. Annabeth was a bitch and kept getting knocked over. I mean, in so many scenes, Annabeth was just knocked over and out until Percy came over to help her up. And when the bull attacked Percy, she didn't even go back to return the favor! She just left him. These movies are killing one of my all time favorite female characters. Now onto Annabeth's racism. I get that a cyclops killed Thalia, but that should not have been enough mental scarring to make her hate the whole race. Now in the books, Annabeth is traumatized by a cyclops who abducted her friends and used the voice of her neglectful father to lure her to what would have been her death. Everything bad in her life was thrown at her there! And her heroes were held captive, completely relying on her to save them.New topic! So I was very disappointed with the missing scenes. Particularly Circe's Island. Yes, I get that they incorporated it with the theme park, but I wanted to see Percy turned into a guinea pig! And Annabeth save him! And the pirates, and stealing the ship! Which leads me to another missing scene: The Sirens. I feel as if that was not only a bonding moment for Percy and Annabeth, but also for the readers to connect with her.Another bad part was the fighting. The fights were practically all just monsters throwing people against walls! There was some hand to hand, and some sword action(That sounds wrong...), but mostly it was clobbering time with fifty monster hulks! I was very glad that they changed Annabeth's hair to blonde though, It made the movie seem significantly more on key with the book, even though the plot was so far off.I also say kudos for the CGI. Especially that Steampunk bull at the beginning. That was cool.I'm almost glad I paid to see it, just so I could force myself to sit through the whole thing.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
201,mayamdm98,Terrible,2,14 August 2013,"I honestly thought it was more comedic than epic. Of course, I might be saying this because I read the books-but if they'd stuck to the go**** storyline we wouldn't be having this problem. They didn't even get Circe's land or Clarisse-the girl who refused to cooperate with Percy-right! And then, KRONOS. My God. KRONOS. Yeah, let's have him be defeated by one measly demigod in less than fifteen minutes when it took the three most powerful gods to defeat him before. All in all, I feel like the creators got my hopes up and then took covered me in diarrhea. I feel like I should lock them in a room with the entire book series and refuse to let them out until they've all memorized it word for word. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. DON'T. JUST DON'T. JUST WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT ON DVD, AND WATCH IT ONLY IF THERE AREN'T ANY DECENT MOVIES. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOUR KIDS BEG YOU TO SEE IT, DON'T TAKE THEM.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
202,princss-dirctioner,Better than the first but not good enough,7,16 August 2013,"Percy Jackson the Sea of Monsters was generally a better movie than the Lightning Thief. However, it still did not reach my level of satisfaction. I'll give them props that they put Clarisse La Rue, didn't disappoint with Tyson in and actually died Annabeth's hair blond, but there was one thing that really ticked me off: the fight with Kronos. This fight wasn't supposed to happen until the 5th book and it doesn't take 5 minutes to kill him. Tyson's appearance wasn't a disappointment but his personality didn't reflect the book version of him. In the book he is ""a big baby"" as Percy put it, not a normal personality for his age. And if they didn't mess up the first movie, Percy would've been 14-15 in the Sea of Monsters which would hold the prophecy at 16 not 20. I honestly believe I could be a better director towards these Percy Jackson movies then the previous 2. In other words, the director was better than the first, but he was still not good enough.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
203,fangirllovespie,"awesome, but terrible.",4,17 August 2013,"I don't know what the hell happened to this thing. They completely changed the movie. don't get me wrong, the movie itself was great, but nothing was like the book. complete rip off. Kronos rises. Percy hears the prophesy. the prophecy was changed. i don't know why the could've just put a few twists on the book and made that the script. plus, there was a perfect opportunity for a kiss, and they didn't take it! Percy was holding Annabeth's face because she was dying, and they were looking at each other in the eyes lovingly with their faces 5 inches apart!! and no kiss!!! ridiculous. plus they don't get eaten in the book. and Clarisse was beautiful, not with stringy hair, and she wasn't buff. Chiron wasn't expelled to. i don't know why they didn't do this the right way. I'm very disappointed. if you didn't read the book then you will probably love the movie, but if you have read the book, you will probably hate it since they changed almost everything, but you will love it because the features were great, and the script was fantastic, but no kiss!!!!!! i want to make my own version to the movie where it is a lot like the book, but with some cool twists. i say the similar thing to Percy Jackson and the lightning thief. don't hate me for this. I'm speaking my opinion.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
204,mein_pink,"Seriously?? Percy Jackson fans, read this and try to tell me that you don't agree.",3,24 August 2013,"OK, let's start with the fact this second movie is 100% totally different from the books. Maybe it's not 100%, but you guys get the point. OK, fine, I'll give a little credit for making the movie, perfect cast, and awesome acting scenes. I know it's not an easy job but I'm sure it's enjoyable right. I personally have dreamed about being a script-writer or a director. Just a thought, anyone who's about to direct the next Percy Jackson movie or any other movie that is ""based on a best-selling novel"", if it's a series.. Read each and everyone of the books. Because then you might get the fact wrong, and especially if the books has a lot of mystery question that the answer is supposed to be revealed at the end of the series. And also think about the hundreds, thousands fans of the novel who might not like it if you got the whole story wrong....I wanna talk about the major wrong facts that will affect the outcome in the other movies....1) the sirens are missing... They're supposed to reveal Annabeth's fatal flaw, which will affect what Percy and Annabeth's action in the second Titan war. 2) Luke never did get a hold of the Golden Fleece... He didn't get the chance to resurrect Kronos 3) Also by that second fact. Kronos did not in fact swallow Luke. Just think about it, if your evil Titan ""grand father"" swallowed you, would you still give him your life??? 4) Silena Beauregard wasn't supposed to be revealed as one of the demigods who turned. It's the whole mystery that will in fact make every camper thinking ""Who's the spy from Kronos's army?"" It will affect the battle of Manhattan and it will also affect Annabeth's actions against Luke. 5) Grover was suppose to be on the hunt to find the great God Pan which then will get him captured by Polyphemus. And then he's supposed to make an empathy link between himself and Percy to ask Percy for help. That empathy link is going to help them save the entire world. 6) Listen, Ares is like probably one of the main character in the novel. He's ""the god who turned"". He was in Percy's first prophecy ( don't get me started on that.. Percy is suppose to me the oracle and ask for a quest at the first movie, he did not sneak out, well he did sneak out at the second movie). Ares is suppose to appear at Clarisse's ship. It shows the image that Clarisse fears her father. 7) Percy is not suppose to be at camp. It's suppose to be summer camp. Note the word summer. He was suppose to be at school, with Tyson (at this point he Percy didn't know Tyson was his brother and a Cyclopes), which they're attacked by cannibal giants and Annabeth came to the rescue. 8) Tyson was in fact homeless but he did not lives in the woods. Percy knew him because they went to the same school. When they went to camp he saved Percy's life and then he got claimed. The movie has the wrong sequence on events, and I'm not just talking about Tyson, I'm talking about the whole movie, seriously. 9) Chiron is suppose to get fired. They suspected Chiron for poisoning Thalia's tree. Which in the end, his named was cleared. He was found innocent but he opened up to Percy about the fact that Kronos (the evil Titan lord) is his father. 10) Actually Percy did not go to see Hermes. Hermes himself approach Percy for guidance and to ask for Percy's help. He was concerned about Luke and his choices because he cared so much about Luke. Btw the thermos is true but the magic sealer is not. Hermes gave Percy vitamin gummy bears which kinda saved his life from Circe. 11) As I mention before at number 10. Percy was suppose to run into Circe. A woman who controls magic and apparently turned Percy into a guinea pig. Which then he was turned back when he ate Hermes's vitamin gummy bear. 12) Again on the oracle topic. What is up with all the missing prophecy. The whole point of doing quest is the mystery of the prophecy behind it. The prophecy tells them how to start the quest, but also the end of the quest. It's the mystery of the future that keep people and heroes guessing. It's the unraveling of the prophecy that keeps people reading or watching. 13) Percy knew about the great prophecy, it's true. He did in fact wondered if he was the child of the prophecy. But he did not actually here the full prophecy until he was 16(Another mistake, the movie said the prophecy happen when he turns 20). 14) This one is the most critical mistake of all the other mistakes. When Percy cut of Kronos's foot with Riptide, Kronos said ""The cursed blade.."". Let me tell all of you readers out there, Riptide is not the cursed blade, it's not Riptide. The cursed blade is a huge mystery, it will change the future and Percy's actions. This is a massive mistake that will make the movie terrible. This changes the whole story and it will not add up to the adventure it should be.There is a lot of other mistakes but I think you get the point. I'm the last person that'll want to write a bad review but it's the cold hard fact that this movie is a huge disappointment. Other people might not care but Rick Riordan fans all over the world will think the same. Another tip or two, please consult the writer of the novel you're making your movie from, and if you read the stories, the novels are amazing, don't ruin a perfect piece of story with one bad movie.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
205,courtney_marie_w,Much much better than the first movie and more accurate for you book fans,8,18 August 2013,"Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters was a whole lot better than The Lightning Thief, hands down. In this movie they actually took the time to explain what wasn't in the first movie. It was a little iffy though due to the fact that the director had to make up for the screw ups made by the previous director while keeping mostly true with the storyline. The only thing that irked me was the fight with partially resurrected Kronos. I do kinda miss Tyson calling the hippocamp 'horse fishies' and naming it 'Rainbow'. Ah, well, still really well done though. Definitely looking forward to The Titans Curse. The third one should move along more smoothly. 8/10 for this movie and the great effort made to fix things up.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
206,jl15942,Plot=not great,3,19 August 2013,"I am a fan of the book series, but not so hardcore that I get upset whenever there's a small deviation from the book. That being said, even though I have no problem with not being true to the book, the director still needs to make good choices and create a good movie if he is going to do so. I came into the movie with pretty low expectations, and it still managed to disappoint me in many ways. I thought most of the acting was much better than that of the first movie (the lightning thief was very corny at parts), and the casting choices had a lot of potential (Tyson and Clarisse were good choices), but the plot was disorganized and unclear, and even though I had read the books I was confused and barely had any idea what was going on. Action scenes weren't bad, but terrible plot development as there wasn't much buildup or climax. It was just one event after the other. All that being said I don't regret seeing the movie. Even if I knew how bad it was I would have still seen it, and I suggest others go see it too anyways just for the sake of seeing it and supporting logan lerman, who I think is a great actor even if he wasn't used to his full potential in these movies.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
207,athenamilbert,Good Movie but Nothing like the Books,4,26 August 2013,"First thing, let me just say I have read all the PJO and HOO books and I must say, what a fantastic series! Applause to Rick Riordan.Second Thing, this movie was awesome, classic adventure, evil enemies, and twisted plots, that is for someone who hasn't read the books. There were a lot of different things in the movie, including Tyson coming to CHB instead of Percy finding him at school, Polymepheus at an amusement park run by Circe instead of on a completely different island, the kids being the same ages in the beginning, and the fact that they took out the 2 best scenes- Percy turning into a guinea pig, and the sirens. Of course these are all little things that most wouldn't care about. But the fact that Kronos was resurrected in this movie as a fiery giant and Percy killed him , not Luke himself, well, thats different. In the books, 2 years after traversing the sea of monsters, Kronos is alive but in Luke's body. Luke kills him by stabbing Kronos, in the process killing himself, hence Kronos in Luke's body. But in the movie, it happened right there on Circe's island and Kronos ate Luke and Grover while he was a giant flaming thing. I guess what I'm trying to say is that they combined the whole series into this movie in a very wrong and disappointing way.Either way, this movie is a must see if you are not as judgmental as me or my other fangirl friends.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
208,JoshAnderson2785,Beware the Sea of Monsters...but probably not for the reasons you think.,4,25 August 2013,"I wanted to like this movie. No, that's wrong; I wanted to LOVE this movie. See, I like anything that has to do with ancient mythology, be it Greek, Roman, Norse...you get the idea. I own the Percy Jackson series of novels, and have read through them several times; they are among my favorites for a quick, entertaining read. And that, more than anything, is what made this movie so disappointing for me.See, I know that the book is always better than the movie. It has to be, that's the way it is. But this movie doesn't even come close to the book. So much has been changed, and not for the better. Too many puns and weak jokes, characters that behave nothing at all like their paper and ink selves, and some outright plot changes that, in my opinion, weaken the story.I get it; they wanted that PG rating. The book, as it was written, is at least PG-13 material. So yes, this is a more family-friendly version of the story. But it is a poor reflection of the source material, for those of us who have read it and loved it. If you've not read the story, and you're judging the film entirely on it's own as a stand-alone story, perhaps you'll feel differently. But for myself, as a fan of the over-arching plot, the characters, and Rick Riordan, I can do no better than give this a 4/10.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
209,aimawayleo13,Not what I expected,3,17 September 2013,"To be honest, I did think that this movie was going to be worse than Lightning Thief after seeing what Lightning Thief looked like. In this movie, I truly do wish they kept the same actors as The Lightning Thief, though. I took one look at Chiron in the Sea of Monsters and was completely stunned at how they didn't even give in any effort into making him sort of look like the Chiron in Lightning Thief. Also, in this movie, I feel like I could sometimes just sense that they were acting. I'm new to reviewing movies, in fact this is my first one, but I can tell you right now that I don't usually realize in the middle of a movie that it's acting. I usually like to stay in with the story line and imagine it happening. Also, would anyone like to tell me why Kronos has already rose and Percy has defeated him in a few minutes? Kronos does not rise in the second book. Not the second book but they add it into the movie? This was completely out of line. Kronos rose in this movie, and I was completely horrified of how they changed the plot. I understand that they may have wanted to add some suspense or action, but this was just not acceptable in my mind. I love the book series, and this movie didn't even match close to what I thought the movie could almost be like. And trust me, I don't usually find any movies that I don't like. I even liked The Lightning Thief with all its changed content. Overall, it's not what I expected. I won't be the best person to score this movie, since I'm not experienced at all, but I guess this gives you a little sense of how I think. I would not watch it again, and that's all I have to say. Thanks for reading.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
210,dewaelelaw,for book readers and non-readers,3,25 September 2013,"Lets start with the voice over introduction, its a nice thought but for a movie like this where its about Greek myths and Gods but I don't think its quite fits the movie and it sounds awful come from Percy.Then come the part where we first learn about Luke, Annabeth, Grover and Thalia. this is also where we find out about the protective shield that stops monsters from getting into the camp. I thought that this was done very well and it made me feel reassured that the movie couldn't be a complete disaster but was I wrong!!! That brings us on the next topic. Clarisse, now as much as I love Leven Rambin I wouldn't have pictured her to play the role. she much to good looking and attractive to play a role of a character who's meant to be about as attractive as the but off a cow, not to mention that Clarisse is supposed to be massive and muscly which Leven isn't really. furthermore Tyson who is the Cyclops is also not portrayed very well in this movie. Tyson is mean to be a big guys, not in a muscly way but height wise he should be the tallest in the camp and his speech is far to good for his character. Tyson is meant to be a slow verbally which he isn't.Now there are some Points in the movie that were actually impressive but at the same time there were little thing to notice which just didn't make the movie as good as it could have been. the fact that Grover is around just doesn't make any sense, we shouldn't be seeing him until have way through at least, the fact the they only decided to give Annabeth the blond hair in the second movie and not the first is just an insult!!! lets move on now to the boat scene which was a huge stab in the back and I was massively disappointed, they give Luke a small to medium sized boat that we see people use in ""Wicked Tuna"" a TV series from Natgeo. now what The F***. its meant to be a massive cruise Ship or liner that holds an incredible amount off monsters and demi-goods. basically Luke's army but what get is pathetic, they have completely messed thing up and if they did make another movie I would even bother to watch it as it would be worse, the fact that the cruise ship is not included in the movie means that they would be not be able to make the other very well. seeing as it plays a huge role in the next 3 books after sea of monster,they also left out Blackjack, he is a very important character in the series. for those of you who haven't read the books. blackjack is a Pegasus and he is saved by Percy or at least he was meant to be but now nothing!!! also that Fact that Annabeth had to open her big mouth and say that she saw ""Silena Beauregard"" just makes thing worse as it ruins the books and the story line that have been created their!! moving on I thought that the stomach part in the giant monster was done pretty well, but it could have been better. Clarisse never agrees with Percy in the books and she doesn't really like anyone which isn't what we see in this part off the film, next come Circe's island which is also a important part of the book and it leads to other thing which then appear in future books but no!!! no Circe on Circe's island. but I will say that the scenes with Polyphemus were by far my favorite and the most enjoyable filled with laughter as Grover pretends to be a female Cyclops.What come next is the worst and most unbelievable part of the movie, where Kronos is rises and eats Luke and then is defeated by a couple of swing of Percy's sword!! I'm sorry but who ever came up with that is about as imaginative as a pile of dog poop. it doesn't even have any ties to the books and ruins further plots that could have been made.In conclusion, this is just about one of the worst film I have ever wanted to watch and now I feel ashamed to have even watched it. the list of things that aren't even close to the book or that have been adapted to make the movie better have in fact in my opinion made it a disaster!! that is why if they were going to make a ""The Titans Curse"" I wouldn't even bother watching the trailer, its just going to be a disappointment and they would try to cram left overs from sea of monster in to in making it an even more movie then it could have possibly been.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
211,travisbodenstein,Awful,2,31 January 2014,"This movie is just terrible. If you have read the books do not bother watching the movie because it is nothing like the book. They honestly should be ashamed for making this movie. It wasn't the least bit enjoyable because the majority of the movie never happened in the book. It's like they made it up from nowhere, and didn't refer to the book one time.I fully understand that a movie cannot be made exactly like the book it is based off of, but this movie was just ridiculous. They left out important parts of the book and made up so much stuff that never happened. I personally thought the books were fantastic, so I don't understand why they thought they had to change so much in the movie.I mean seriously the girl playing Annabeth doesn't even have blonde hair, Percy had blue eyes in the movie when he has green eyes in the book, and they made it seem that there isn't mist everywhere changing the mortals sight. Tyson had to spray mist on his face to make it look like he had two eyes. These are just a few things that were wrong, and believe me there were many many more.

I even went as far as reading the book to see if I was wrong, well the movie is about how Percy Jackson (half-blood son of Poseidon) and his group go on a quest in search of the golden fleece in order to restore a magic shield that protects the half-blood camp. I didn't find the comedy scenes funny enough didn't even care about the characters (in contrast with ""Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief"" ), about the only thing enjoyable was a brief scene with Nathan Fillion and probably a few cgi moments, it felt more like an error with the script rather than acting.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

Ho, hum. Obviously, all sci-fi/fantasy flicks involve doing things that are impossible in the real world, but such things should at least be internally consistent and have some sort of point. A lot of this doesn't. For example, at one point the heroes are trying to escape in a lifeboat, but they drop the outboard motor into the ocean. So one of them opens up some sort of thermos bottle that sprays out a jet of something or other, thereby moving the boat ahead. What? That's just dumb.

When I heard the second movie, Sea of Monsters, would follow the plot of the book much more closely, I was excited to see what they could do to amaze me. Alas the movie was the second let down in this series. The major points from the book that made it as amazing as I believe it to be were either removed, or altered greatly to which it was not enjoyable. I also find the movie very slow and drawn out when there is no need for extra dialogue/plot progression areas when the plot isn't even what the fans want. My advice would be, stick to the plot and story line from the books. There is the potential for greatness, but no follow through. I hope, if they do make The Titans Curse, that it will actually dumbfound the viewers and show how amazing these movies can be if they stick to the book's path rather than their own.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

219,benjamin_98-848-316704,"So crap it's an insult to crap, to call it crap",1,18 November 2013,"I just finished watching this production, as it doesn't deserve to be called a film, with a burning desire to gouge my own eyes out. I'm a huge fan of the books and was insulted with the whole movie. I also couldn't believe that they left out key events like the:*Sirens *Hermes being cool *Clarisse being a total bitch *Circe's island *Pirates and the queen Ann's revenge *The swordfight on the yacht between Luke and Percy *The dazed mortals on the ship *Tyson being a clumsy, but lovable Cyclops with a gift in the forge *Tantalus and his reign of terror The list is endless. But had the nerve to replace it with crap like this: *An amusement park on a Cyclops island *Percy hugging Tysonfor ever instead of grabbing the fleece *Kronos (more powerful then the Gods) Yet was beaten in mere seconds *That climbing wall scene at the beginning *Demi-gods knowing martial arts *Annabeth being crap in a fight *Random monsters that were never there in the first place And worst of all...*The entire movie. So if you want to see Hollywood defile the fantastic Percy Jackson series then this is the movie for you. Watch how the director and the screen writers (not worthy enough to be named) replace the characters you came to love with emotionless, shallow robots who can't act. And don't forget that bullshit hidden message about how you 'make your own destiny'. After that rant and the appalling acting, directing, writing, CGI and the characters I found one positive. The end credits. Seriously it's so bad not even M Night Shyamalan could make a movie this bad. Now that's saying something. Oh, I almost forgot *This review may contain spoilers*",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
220,bailinhq,This was JUST a LITTLE better than the first movie.,5,18 November 2013,"Okay, I saw the trailer and I thought ""It looks much more promising than the first one."" At least,this time they got Annabeth's hair right. However, I couldn't have been so wrong.There are some stuff that are really lame or aren't based in the book.-Tyson should be tall, VERY tall and should be UGLY, ugly as hell. I mean, come on, he's a cyclops! He's technically a MONSTER! -The freaking GREAT PROPHECY is for his sixteen birthday, not TWENTY! It's like the biggest motif in the whole series. Just... come on!-In Greek mythology, whoever is eaten by Charybdis is dead. That's it, dead. In the book, they aren't swallowed. They go to Scylla's side of the sea. -The movie plot does not strenghthens the romantic bond between Percy and Annabeth. -Clarisse hates Percy. She can't immediately start obeying all he says! -How come Anaklusmos, a sword that was given to Heracles/Hercules son of Zeus, has a FREAKIN TRIDENT in it? That doesn't make sense. -How come Percy, a demigod, slayed practically full-grown Chronos with one slash. Not even the gods of Olympus...Pros: -They got Annabeth's hair right. Yay for that. -The first 10 min and the last 10 min were the most accurate thing in the entire movie. -Mr. D's role is pretty damn good. -It's funny. -It's a 7/10 movie for people who haven't read the book.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
221,OkamiJapan101,Awesome movie to the max!!!,9,4 December 2013,"WARNING!! This review might contain spoilers!! Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is about four friends traveling to the Sea of Monsters to retrieve a golden fleece to revive the tree that emanates a protective barrier around their home. Without that barrier, they are defenseless against attack. There are many other hazards besides being in the middle of the sea of monsters such as; Polyphemus, the Cyclops that guards the fleece, and Luke, a half-blood who is trying to get the fleece to revive an ancient evil to destroy the earth! Percy and his friends overcome these hazards, but Luke gets his hands on the fleece and is able to revive the ancient evil! Percy uses his sword that he got from his father ,Poseidon, to defeat the evil and they won. Whenever they used the fleece to revive the tree, it actually reversed the process, and it turned back into the girl that it was made from. The prophecy told that a child of the three original gods would defeat that evil, and Thalia, (The girl from the tree) was the daughter of Zeus, one of the three original gods. So maybe Percy wasn't the one to defeat the evil. Maybe it was Thalia. It is uncertain.Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters was very effective at showing character development and plot elements. The special effects weren't totally awesome, but most were pretty cool. I thought that Percy was pretty cute. The suspense scenes were making me think, ""What's going to happen next!?"" Some scenes were predictable, but some were not, but that's okay.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
222,georgiewellock-868-947724,A disappointment.,3,12 December 2013,"Whilst my hopes weren't high for this movie, due to the equally disappointing 'Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief' I was sure that something different would be done with the sequel to make the series more popular with viewers.If someone is watching this movie without reading the books then they may see the storyline as being brilliant with lots of action and intensity. However for someone who has read and loves Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series, the film was abysmal. The main issues I found with this adaptation were the way imperative sub-stories were missed out and replaced with mediocre scenes and the relationships between the characters being completely wrong for the situation, as the build up of Percy and Annabeth's relationship has been skipped and Clarrisse and Percy suddenly become the best of friends and work together? Their hatred for each other is supposed to be deep. Finally, the one thing that stood out for me as ruining the series was the rise of Kronos. Throughout the books his revival is step by step and slow which makes the final book so climatic however this was completely wasted at the end of the film for a short action packed scene which left me wondering what just happened! The only explanation I can come up for with this waste is that they wanted Kronos to appear in the film if they weren't planning on continuing and shooting Titan's Curse, however this seems contradictory as they ended the film with the cliffhanger revival of Thalia. In conclusion, the film has wasted the most important factors of the book series and therefore has opened the rest of the films to the same inevitable disappointment.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

If you actually like the movie, reed the book and see how big an idiot you are! The first movie I didn't like, but I could live with it, but this makes me want to erase both movies from the entire universe so someone can start over with someone thats ELEVEN! Even I could do a better job, and I aren't even fifteen years old! Can someone please do me the favor to remake these movies before they totally ruin even the Percy Jackson books for me fore ever.

224,huntervasey97,Pretty Good.,9,10 January 2014,"I think that this movie being the second in the series kept to the book a bit more than it's prequel. Though I noticed quite a few discrepancies in the story (might not be using that word right.) Though as I did not check this off as having spoilers, I'm not going to say what they are so that more people can view my opinion, anyway though it did not make as much money box office as the first one, ""Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief"" or maybe there's no ""and the"" in the title but not too sure, anyway again, not I or any of my friends saw it in the theaters, though we did rent it and watch it at home and I'm not too sure but I don't think that counts as "" box office"" income or not. I also believe that if the producers or whomever had not waited so long to release the sequel, it would have received more income from theaters and rentals. I also believe that people should not compare this title to the Harry Potter series, as they are hardly alike at all other than being about a teenager with magical upbringings. If need be I would start a petition or something of the sort if the producers don't want to finish the series in films (dvds and whatnot) as I know a plethora of people that really enjoy the series and would pay the price for a ticket or rental. Anyway (I know I've said that word plenty of times in this post) I apologize for any errors in spelling or bad sentence structure, I'd like to think that I usually write rather well, but as I am using a mobile device, this review took quite some time to write and was a wee bit difficult.

226,paulblofis22,Anarchy Forever,5,14 January 2014,"Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters was a highly anticipated movie by both Percy Jackson fans and action lovers. The movie begins with our main character, Percy Jackson, telling the story of Thalia to the viewers. It's basically about a daughter of Zeus who sacrificed herself to save her three other friends. Her father pitied her and saved her by turning into a tree, thus creating the magical borders that protected Camp Half- Blood. Meanwhile, Percy Jackson begins to feel like he was a one-hit- wonder because of the failure to complete any other quests. His father, Poseidon, sends him a half-brother (who happens to be a Cyclops) named Tyson. After these events Luke (the main antagonist of The Lightning Thief) teleports to camp to poison Thalia's tree, therefore weakening the camp's protective borders. After being baited by Luke, Percy hears the Great Prophecy learning that the child of the eldest gods (meaning Percy) could be the key in Olympus's safety or destruction. To cure Thaila's tree Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson ""hijack"" Clarisse's official quest to find the Golden Fleece. Although the movie had outstanding special effects and a decent cast, the movie lacked in plot and character development. Usually the point of a movie version of a book is to give an image of how the book should have gone. But the plot took a drastic turn from the actual events in the book. The characters were hard to connect to due to their personalities being butchered in the first movie. Important events in the story were often misplaced or left out completely, such as the age the prophecy pertained to. The movie received decent ratings by many critics, achieving the score of 3/5 and in some cases a bit higher. Despite the fact that the rating weren't incredibly high, the movie did roll in profits. My personal opinions on this movie is that it was less than decent but not horrible. It lacked that the excitement that the books delivered. The plot was rushed and often strayed off from the book and even strayed away more than the first movie. If this was an original movie (the book never existed) I would have given it a 7.5/10 but as the book does exist, I have to give it a 2.5/5. Even though my score was fairly low, I would still watch the third movie for the sake of criticizing it.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
227,melanie-956,white complex,2,18 January 2014,"This review may contain SPOILERS!!!! SO WATCH OUT. Anyway I watched this movie with a friend of mine, and the movie in my opinion really depicts the story of the white plight. For starters the crew is almost entirely white. They are children of gods, and are a sort of privileged youth, kind of similar to the children of rich white kids. In this movie we encounter the cyclops kid, from the woods; he is the stand in for poor white people from the sticks. Think about it, he doesn't look like a demi god(rich white kid) but he is related(as he is also white), so the movie continues. The cyclops does things to help the other kid, and the other kid (never really helps him) but learns to appreciate him as a brother. Now some of you may say no this movie isn't racist he saved the comic relief black guy, alright. I'm not saying the movie is racist, but if you can't put together that the pen that turns into a sword is actually a metaphorical pen, that he can metaphorically write his own destiny with, think about ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" and stuff along those lines. This movie is speckled with things that reinforce white right and it's a silly and fun movie, but if you don't at least consider these and many other correlations this has to that topic you're missing the point of the film. I didn't really enjoy it except for the end, it makes it you feel like you didn't waste a whole bunch of time watching this movie.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
228,zebrabeez,Worst Motion Picture I Have Ever Seen,1,19 January 2014,"My gosh, where do I start? Chiron is a white stallion, not a brown stallion. Chiron wasn't at Camp until the end of the BOOK, but he was there in the movie. Tantalus was there instead in the Book, but not in the movie. Percy starts off at school in the Book, but not in the movie. Mr. D wore outrageous clothing and had a bad attitude in the BOOK, but not in the movie. They COMPLETELY changed up the prophecy in the movie as well.

229,deltol81,This review is the opinions of many.,1,22 January 2014,"Dear 20th Century Fox, After watching Percy Jackson: The Lightening Thief in seventh grade, I was enthused and excited to read books. Upon reading the books however, I could see how others who had read the books before could be so frustrated from the way it turned out. I learned that you had changed quite an awful lot to the story and the plot line. In fact, it seemed that the only thing that you had gotten right was the fact that his name was Percy Jackson and the actor had dark hair. From the first play of the film score to the roll of the credits, it seemed as though you had completely neglected the book as a reference and instead used your ""brilliant"" ideas in it's place. Where was the trip to Montauk? Why was Annabeth a battle strategist brunette instead of a intelligent blond? How is it that Grover was suddenly able to defend not only himself, but Percy and Sally as well? How is it that in the books, they could summon every monster in a 30 mile radius by simply staring into an LCD screen, yet Luke has an entire alcove full of technology? Where was this mighty duel between Ares? How in Zeus's name did they end up at the Parthenon? Why did Luke suddenly decide to show up to claim that ""Yes, it is I that stole the bolt! Now I must stop you from taking it back!"" when they didn't even realize who took it until the end of the book? Why, 20th Century Fox??? And this is only a few of the screw ups in Percy Jackson the Lightening Thief! I haven't even mentioned how you completely wrote out Luke, Annabeth and Grover's relationship with the camp's barrier, Thalia! Or the fact that they didn't actually go ""clubbing"" in Lotus Casino and instead went skeet shooting off of the balcony and parachuted in the casino! They were 12! 12!!! And you made them appear to be, what? 16, 17 or 18? It doesn't matter what, but it was FAR from 12! You also ""forgot"" to even mention the water park, Louisville arch, Gladys the rich poodle, and the fact that only Percy went to Olympus to return it the bolt. You also forgot MANY others major details in the story. I was not impressed. For years I have waited for you to correct the mistakes you made with a new one or at least patch it up with the 2nd, but no, you went and screwed that up too. Where was the other bull? Why is Tyson suddenly a stranger to Percy when he was the one that rode on the Subway with him everyday to seventh grade? Where is Annabeth's invisibility hat? Why is Clarisse finally mentioned? Who is this new Chiron? Why is Mr. D mentioned now and where is the Diet Coke? Okay, so maybe you forget the ""little"" things, but Where is Circe's Island? Why is the Princess Andromeda a yacht instead of a cruise ship? Why is there only one gigantic Hippocampus instead of 3 little ones? Where's Blackjack? Why is Grover a chamber maid instead of a bride? So many questions and so little answers to your brain lapses and you have had quite a few! Circe's island was a spa, Polycemus's was a haven. They were not combined into a creepy theme park. Clarisse was the one with self esteem problems because of Percy, not the other way around. Hermes came and found Percy not Percy happened upon him. Tantalos was the one that assigned Clarisse the quest and Percy, Annabeth and Tyson left secretly. The Oracle doesn't tell Percy the prophecy until he is 15 and it happens when he is 16 not 20. Percy doesn't even know anything about the prophecy except for what Annabeth accidentally mentions to him. Clarisse's boat blows up from the pistons blowing up when they are attacked by Scylla and they are never swallowed, and that is where Tyson is lost, not when Luke shoots him at the Cyclop's island. The Titan Lord doesn't come back at all until the 4th book, Chris Rodrigues and Silena Beaugard aren't known to be traitors until the 4th and 5th, No one else wants to go on a quest with Clarisse because they chicken out, Tantalos replaces Chiron, Annabeth wants to hear the songs the siren's sing and Percy pulls her back when they are in the Sea of Monsters, Luke doesn't catch them until they get back to Florida, Chiron gets fired because of not being able to cure or prevent Thalia's tree from being poisoned, it was not a Cyclops that killed Thalia but a mixture of monsters though it was a cyclops that delayed them getting to the camp fast enough and Annabeth was 7, not 12, Tyson didn't know his parentage, Annabeth was the one that let him into camp, Grover was not a stud ever, nor was he captured by Chris Rodriguez, Mr. D was pudgy, Clarisse did not have flowing locks, and Percy did not have random chats with a lake aka his dad!!! Now I realize that you may never post this because it doesn't live up to your standards to post only good things on your little page, but I just want you to know that is a waste of an author's capabilities when you turn it into as something horrible as this. Sincerely, the Ticked Off Fangirls",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
230,kwhite-906-141443,My favorite movie ever!!,10,25 January 2014,I have to be completely honest. Percy Jackson is one of the most amazing movies ever. It's one of those movies that you can feel all the emotions and you can see all the hard work that has gone into the making of the film. It is a movie that leaves you wondering and leaves you wanting more. After the first one it kind of left me wondering what they would do next and how things would be different. I really want another one because these movies are perfect. It would kind of be upsetting if they don't come out with another movie because I really want to know what adventures they will have and where they will go next. So all in all Percy Jackson is an amazing movie and I would love to see another one soon.,Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters
231,blueisharold,It's actually alright,8,16 May 2014,"The first one in the now dead movie series wasn't good. But Sea of Monsters is actually not bad. The trailer sucked. Badly. Terribly actually. I was expecting a blue, huge cyclops who can't form long sentences and is a big awkward fellow. Not this mellow version. Annabeth is annoying. The lines are too store-bought and cliché. The humor that comes because of Percy's narration is desperately missing. Annabeth isn't cool enough. Clarice is too...girly. She's a big, guffy, grungy girl. With mean muscles.It's not too bad, really...they should do a third movie. It's not that bad.",Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters

Really?,1,9 June 2014,"1 out of 10 (because there isn't a score lower than 1)This movie was awful, if I wanted to see a movie completely made out of C.G.I, I would have re-watched Transformers. But this movie wasn't Transformers, it was supposed to be Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters - But what I got was a sorry excuse for a easy way to make some box office profits.First of, I do not know what the director and the team of writers was thinking when they decided to incorporated main story plot lines from the LAST book into this movie. I feel like the writers just cut and paste into the script to wherever they wanted just to make the story ""simple"".Acting was amateur, Character development is hardly present, Where was the part in the book where Annabeth discovers her fatal weakness? Or the scenes where she reveals to Percy her dream of rebuilding New York city. In fact where is any of that supposed Athena Demigod Wisdom that she is supposed to have? Don't even get me started on the actor playing Percy Jackson, Dude...You made the character a blank, emotionless zombie - even less actually because even the zombies on the CSS Birmingham had facial expressions.All Intentional jokes from the book are delivered - but not in the way they were intended to be.Did I mention added plot lines from the last book in the series?In conclusion, I really hope there is not a sequel, and I hope I will be able to purge this movie from my memory.

The movie does such a poor job of following the story line of the book. It does not even seem like they are attempting to follow it. For anyone who is as much of a fan as I am of these books, stay away from this movie. It is a waste of your time and not worth watching. I personally do not understand why they do not choose to follow the story line. The movies would be one million times better if they followed the book.

These spoilers were feeble attempts to make the movie interesting, because they had already cut the good parts from the first one. Not even the basic mythology was correct. The scene with Kronos briefly coming back ruined the chance of decent sequels, and hugely disappointed me as a reader.

Her tirade goes on for the entire film, until at the end, this shy hero that would put Achilles, Hercules or any of the like to shame, saves the day. But, what bothers me more than anything, is that in these 20 pages of extended comments, by a bunch of (actually I don't know who you people are) did not notice.
