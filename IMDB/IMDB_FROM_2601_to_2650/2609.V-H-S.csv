0,SnoopyStyle,fine low grade horror with some ups and downs,6,17 October 2021,"This is a found footage film based on VHS tapes. The first of the anthology stories is a group of rampaging young men committing petty crimes. They are recruited to break into a house and steal a bunch of tapes. The second one is three friends bringing women back to their motel room from the bar. The third is a young couple on their honeymoon. The fourth is a bunch of young people going off into the woods. The fifth is people talking through a video chat. The sixth is a Halloween haunted house.As is often the case with anthology movies, there are some good and some bad parts. In this case, some of them are rather memorable and that makes this standout despite the bad. I like the motel room. Mostly, I love the naturally spooky look of Hannah Fierman. I also like the fourth one in the woods. In that one, I like the look of the anomaly. Not all of this works but there is nothing egregious. It's a fine low grade horror.",V-H-S
1,nogodnomasters,I LIKE YOU,6,24 June 2019,"For those who love shaky fake found footage, this one is da bomb. A group of criminals film their escapades of vandalism and assaults to sell to a buyer. They then enter a house to get a VHS tape, they will know it when they see it. The rest of the movie shows us found footage film within a found footage film. Oh joy. There is a dead man in the house sitting in front of a series of TVs. Each hooligan watches a film segment, then disappears from the movie. The film segments are not connected, i.e. there is no real common theme other than it is more snuff than horror with a different type of monster/entity in each piece.The final installment, I thought had the best special effects, but with the jerky camera motion and people screaming makes it difficult to enjoy any of it.Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, and plenty of nudity, including full frontal (Hannah Fierman).",V-H-S
2,kosmasp,Anthology,6,14 November 2012,"What's your initial reaction to ""Found footage Anthology"" or found footage in general? That should give you a bit of a clue, if you should watch this or not. One thing is for sure, if an Anthology movie is only as good as it's weakest link/story, than this would be really bad (the story covering the whole thing is tedious, boring and annoying at best)! But I don't think that it would do the short movies justice that accompany the movie.I actually enjoyed most of them. They don't make sense as usual when it comes to Found Footage (why would they film that again? The who cut/edited them is either easy to answer or makes even less sense, depending on the way you look at it), but the stories themselves are mostly decent. Acting is good to OK (apart from the ""covering"" overall story as mentioned) and the scares are decent too. I still don't get the fascination with Found footage and I sure can't tell you why this spawned a sequel ...",V-H-S
3,Sleepin_Dragon,"A poor, unoriginal film.",3,1 October 2017,"I am shocked by the many positive reviews for this film, I just about hot through it, all I could was that's a hour of my life well and truly wasted, a totally unoriginal story which has been well and truly done to death, but done much better so many times too. I suppose you can say the portmanteau style attempt was brave, but they just got it so horribly wrong, the cheap production values and poor acting just didn't work for me, it felt so amateur from start to finish. The first segment was the best of the bunch, and did at least contain area scares, after that though it really was downhill.This really isn't worth watching, I wouldn't recommend. 3/10",V-H-S
4,gavin6942,"Despite Good Attempts, Too Long And Too Weak",5,7 June 2013,"When a group of misfits is hired by an unknown third party to burglarize a desolate house and acquire a rare VHS tape, they discover more found footage than they bargained for.I should be upfront that I really dislike the ""found footage"" subgenre of horror. While not always bad, it is often annoying to watch and sometimes you have to really suspend your disbelief to new levels in order to accept that a camera would be where it must have been to capture the images. (""Faces of Death"", for example, is easy to label as fake once one realizes which cameras should not be where they are.)With that in mind, I have to give a bit of credit to this film. The ""camera glasses"" were a nice touch in ""Amateur Night"", and a scenario I could completely see a group of college juveniles getting themselves into -- plotting to use the glasses to capture naked women (which is easier said than done). Incidentally, while the buildup in that segment is annoying, the payoff is well worth it and I may have to keep my eye on David Bruckner.Ti West provides the segment ""Second Honeymoon"" about a young couple vacationing in the Old West. I do love that the woman referenced ""Big"", because that was the first thing I thought of upon seeing the Ol' Miner. The concept here is good, but not beautifully executed. As much as West may be horror's Young Turk, found footage seems to not be his forte.""Tuesday the 17th"" fails as found footage (it is basically an 80s slasher without the right feel to it). The concept of a killer who barely shows up on video was clever, but when you are running from a killer, why even be filming at all? ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"" is a much stronger story, and thanks to being a webcam is a much better (and less shaky) film. (This segment works best if you know nothing about it, so I will say no more.) The big question is why the webcam was recording and how it ended up on a VHS tape, but we will have to just ignore that.""10/31/98"" was alright and a generally stronger entry, though it definitely raised the question of why there was any filming going on. We see that a baby monitor is placed inside a bear costume... but there seems to be no reason why someone would film a car ride or even an empty house.Adam Wingard was responsible for ""Tape 56"" (the wraparound). Of Wingard's past work, I can only categorize him as ""experimental"" and am not generally a fan of his directing efforts. While this was far less experimental, I cannot say I was any more a fan of it. Of course, he was pretty limited -- the plot could only be the discovery of a tape collection.I would like to sum up by citing another review. Variety noted that ""the segments vary in quality and the whole overstays its welcome at nearly two hours. Some trimming (perhaps relegating a weaker episode to a DVD extra) would increase theatrical chances."" I think they were spot on here -- the film really tries a viewer's patience for poor film quality.",V-H-S
5,BA_Harrison,Death by Found Footage.,4,15 March 2013,"If, like me, your tolerance for found-footage horror films has seriously diminished over the past fourteen years thanks to the tidal-wave of movies to swamp the sub-genre following The Blair Witch Project, anthology V/H/S will more than likely prove to be the final straw: at nearly two hours, the film irritates and frustrates in equal measures, the low-grade, flickery, wobbly, hand-held camera gimmick doing very little to disguise the fact that none of its stories are actually any good.The wraparound tale, 'Tape 56', directed by Adam Wingard, sees a bunch of amateur criminals break into a house in order to steal a valuable VHS tape; finding the correct tape proves much harder than they thought it would be, there being a huge stack of cassettes to choose from. At random, they begin to watch the tapes, and discover that their owner, who they find dead in his armchair, had an unusual taste in entertainment: real-life recordings in which those involved meet very grisly fates...Cassette one, 'Amateur Night', sees a group of guys recording a wild evening via a pair of video glasses. Picking up a couple of drunken sluts at a nightclub, they return to their motel to start filming a secret sex-tape but realise too late that one of the girls isn't quite human. An unimaginative story with a predictable twist, this is just about watchable thanks to director David Bruckner, who achieves a good deal of tension and delivers some nudity and gore (including a nasty emasculation).Segment two, 'Second Honeymoon', isn't anywhere near as good, doing little to improve my opinion of director Ti West. The story follows a young married couple on a road trip who experience creepy goings on after checking into a motel for the night. Like West's feature length horror efforts, this drags for what seems like an eternity, before finishing with a really weak twist.'Tuesday the 17th', by director Glenn McQuaid, tries to conjure up some of that Blair Witch atmosphere, taking place in a remote wooded locale where a group of campers are attacked by an unseen killer. Some brutal gore and more nudity make matters fairly entertaining, but the story is, once again, extremely weak.Tape number four, 'The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger', is my least favourite of the lot. Director Joe Swanberg channels hit found-footage series Paranormal Activity and throws in some more tits for good measure (which is kind of him), but the story makes zero sense and isn't the slightest bit scary.Before the final tape plays, the wraparound story closes with the criminals being attacked by the dead guy from the armchair, who is now a zombie (how he became this way is not explained).'10/31/98', the last tale in the film, takes place on Halloween and sees a group of friends going to a party, but accidentally arriving at the wrong house. There, the lads believe a series of ghostly occurrences to be clever illusions, but become aware of the gravity of their mistake after stumbling upon a strange ceremony in the attic involving a scared, bound woman and some religious nuts. Despite making little sense, I found this episode to be the most fun overall thanks to decent pacing and plenty of impressive special effects.To sum up, that's a reasonable amount of boobs, bums and bush (plus a bit of sausage for the ladies) and a fair smattering of well executed splatter, but lots of and lots of grainy, headache-inducing shaky cam, very little in the way of decent storytelling (the video ploy being massively contrived at times), one inexplicable zombie, and lots and lots of disappointed viewers (probably).",V-H-S
6,paul_haakonsen,"Another ""movie"" suffering from SHCS (Shaky Hand Camera Syndrome)...",1,7 August 2012,"The story is centered about a group of people who break into an old man's house in order to retrieve a VHS tape, but they find the man dead in a chair with a bunch of monitors flashing static. They find a mysterious tape and play it. On this video tape are some gruesome documented stories. Seriously, who breaks into someone's home and then starts watching video tapes? Any rational thinking person would take the tapes, leave and if the need is to watch, watch it once in the safety of one's own home. It was such a pathetic storyline.The first story is about a group of three young people out drinking in bars where they meet two ladies and bring them back to the hotel room. One of the girls is sort of reclusive and doesn't speak, moving with an odd animal-like pattern to it. What was supposed to be a night of fun and drinking ends up in horror as the woman is not what she appears to be. - This segment had a great enough story, but wow the camera work was so lousy and all over the place, that I just started drifting away from the movie ten minutes into it and started toying with my phone whilst keep semi-attention to the movie. The effects on the woman was great, but it was really blown down a tremendous deal by the questionable camera work. I own a video camera, and I don't even do that kind of shifty camera work. It was just ridiculous.The second story is about a young couple on a road trip, where they document it by video. During their trip they encounter a strange woman who knocks on their motel room door in the middle of the night, asking for a lift in the following morning. As the couple is asleep, a mystery person takes the camera and do some filming. - This segment of ""V/H/S"" was at least shot with a somewhat more steady hand, but the story was sort of dull and uneventful. I will say that the ending to this segment was not really what I had anticipated.The third segment is about four young people, two guys and two girls, who are going out to a remote lake in the woods. The camera has some static interference, always happening when the killer is about to strike. For some reason, this mysterious killer can only be seen through the camera, and is always out of focus and blurred by static. But wait, it gets better, apparently one of the girls have rigged the forest with numerous traps of various sorts to hurt and kill this mystery killer. - Like the previous segments, the third part is also plagued by SHCS (shaky hand camera syndrome) which is really starting to get annoying. The good thing about this segment is that it was more graphic and brutal than the other segments.The fourth segment is between a man and a woman through some kind of web cam broadcasting chat system. And the woman's apartment is apparently haunted by something, and she is worried by the sounds she has heard there. On a live broadcast with the web cams, the woman's guy fried is witness to the strange occurrences. The woman is eager to make contact with the ghost and find out why it is there. - On the upside, then there was minimal of shaky camera work going on in this particular segment. This segment was the one that had the most potential to be the most disturbing and scary of them all, but it turned out to be the one with the most ridiculous plot of all; pure rubbish.The fifth segment takes place on October 31st, 1998, where some young men are dressed up in costumes (soldier, pirate, dog, and something that appears to be a jogger) and drive a car to a party. However when they arrive at the house where the party is taking place, the house is entirely empty, but all lights are on throughout the house. Some strange things start to happen, things appearing out of nowhere and are gone the next instant. The four men follow the muffled sounds upwards, lead through a maze-like design of the house, eager to get to the party. Upon arriving at the attic, where the sound is emanating from, they find four men chanting something in a religious manner, while a woman is tied up between them. Then something interferes with the camera feed and something unnatural starts to happen. - This segment is the one that has the coolest effects and the best atmosphere. But the ending wasn't particularly interesting.Personally I don't understand the hype about these homemade-type kind of movies. They are not worth paying money to watch. When I get a movie I pay for a properly produced movie and not some homemade movie shot with someone's old camera. I could make a movie like this myself and put it out there as well, enough with these ""documentary"" movies that try to pass for entertainment. Made in a way to make it appear like real events, yeah right, and Santa Claws is real as well.This is without a doubt the worst two hours I have spent watching what passes as a movie. It surpasses even ""Paranormal Activity"" with its intolerable shaky camera work. I seriously would like a refund in both the time wasted on watching this nonsense and also on the money wasted to get to watch it. The trailer made the movie seem interesting, but wow, it was actually anything but that.",V-H-S
7,Coventry,Very / Horrible / Sh....,2,19 April 2013,"I never was a big fan of the so-called ""Found Footage"" horror trend, but  No wait, let me rephrase that. I absolutely loathe the vexatious trend of ""Found Footage"" horror that single-handedly contributes a great deal to the further decay of the genre in general! It may just be the humble opinion of one lousy and insignificant horror fanatic, but personally I think that found footage movies are the ideal format for aspiring directors that are untalented and largely incompetent, but nevertheless want to persist in entering the film industry. Found footage movies don't require a real plot, as you can link all the bizarre and inexplicable stuff to supernatural occurrences. Whenever the storyline is stuck or you don't have any budget to shoot a half-decent action sequence, you simply insert some shaky camera images with hysterical yelling in the background and the matter is resolved. Just don't watch them if you hate them so much, I hear you say? Fair point And I'm not watching any more of them, since basically every found footage horror flick is identical to either ""Paranormal Activity"" or ""Blair Witch Project"". I did make two final exceptions as I thought (or hoped) that they would be better and more original efforts, namely Barry Levinson's ""The Bay"" and this ""V/H/S"" assembled by a collective of young and reasonably talented directors.Well, this one was already a giant disillusion and sincerely one of the most unpleasant movies I watched in a very, very long time! ""V/H/S"" exists of one lousily uninspired wraparound story and five separated short segments (one apparently still required multiple directors to complete) of which the best hardly even qualifies as mediocre. All stories contain one or two potentially interesting ideas or gimmicks, but the overall executions are senseless, incoherent and amateurish. The wraparound story introduces a gang of pitiable and endlessly chattering thugs assigned to break into a house and steal a tape. They get more than they bargained for, with the owner of the place lying motionless in armchair and a whole stack of VHS tapes to choose from. The separate segments are then supposed to be on five randomly selected tapes. How very creative not! The first of the tales is – according to me at least – the best of bunch, in spite of making zero sense and not providing any sort of explanation. ""Amateur Night"" sees a trio of studs (or so they think at least) clubbing and seducing drunk girls. One of them wears a special type of glasses that records all their friskiness. When they take two girls back to a sleazy motel room, one of them turns out to be some sort of ghoul/demon with a preference for male flesh. Outrageous gore and a wide variety of naked bodies here, but that about sums it all up. The second tale comes from Ti West; a young independent filmmaker whose career started out promising but lately he seemingly suffers from pretentiousness and shortage of imagination. That's a terrible combination in this industry His story about a couple witnessing some strange things during their holiday has absolutely nothing to offer, except of course for a totally nonsensical and implausible twist at the end. Number three more or less describes itself as the ""Friday the 13th"" of found footage, with some irritating teenagers getting slaughtered in the forest by a maniac whom the camera doesn't manage to capture properly. Total rubbish, apart from a decent eyeball-horror moment. The fourth tale was so dumb and boring that I already don't remember anything, except that it involves web cams and the beautiful natural exposed breasts of Helen Rogers. There's a fifth segment as well, but I slept through most of it, mostly because the hectic camera movements and the overload of noise gave me a terrible headache. Self-respecting horror fans please do yourself a favor and don't watch garbage like this. There are so many great genre movies to discover, with compelling plots and genuinely tense atmospheres. As for me, I will still – very cautiously – give ""The Bay"" a chance and then I'm forever finished with found footage horror. Please don't let me down, Mr. Levinson",V-H-S
8,michaelRokeefe,Creepy burglary.,6,11 July 2013,"There is just something about finding someone's hidden videos. A group of hooligans with way too much time on their hands is hired by a stranger to ransack an old secluded house in search of a possibly damning VHS tape. On arrival, these petty crooks find a decaying house in disarray and upstairs is discovered a corpse sitting in front of several TVs and surrounded by stacks of tapes. If this isn't bizarre enough, they start watching the videos containing macabre and disturbing events...but do they find the correct one they were sent to find?! Grainy, fuzzy and distorted concept of horror. Bloody violence, graphic sexual scenes and throw in some drug use to make the R rating.

9,hitchcockthelegend,Creeper Compendium.,7,10 February 2013,"The horror anthology has a chequered history, some are bad but saved by one great segment, others boast a couple of genuine creepers but are undone by one instalment so bad it tarnishes the film forever. And on it goes. V/H/S brings the format into the new age by unfolding its tales by wrapping around the latest craze of found footage.Six indie directors have produced a picture that was well received at Sundance but has proved to be most divisive with critics and horror fans on internet forums. This will come as no surprise to anyone who knows their horror anthology onions. The usual problems are evident here, a couple of great stories are surrounded by mediocre ones, but at least there is something for everyone, with most bases covered, but that in itself is a problem, all horror fans have preferences, it's a big ask to expect a fan of stalk and slash to love a story about a winged harpy!Then there is the issue of the found footage format, here recorded on actual VHS. Not everyone is a fan (myself for instance), and much of V/H/S is dizzying and often hard to follow, especially as regards the Tape 56/frame narrative story that cloaks the other five stories as a bunch of no-mark young crims burgle a grotty house and sift through the tapes. It's a format loved by many for its supposed realism factors, I don't get that myself, but for those people this really is up their trees!Amateur Night (David Bruckner) and The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger (Joe Swanberg) are the standouts. The former is a cautionary tale of frat boys out for sex who get more than they bargained for when they take home the mysterious Lily, the latter an eerie tale unfolded via Skype communication as Emily appears to be a victim of a haunting whilst chatting to her doctor boyfriend.However, if you ask another fan of the film what stories they feel standout, you may just get two different answers. So as with any other anthology horror, you roll the dice and take your chance, just don't expect genius in every story, for that is purely folly of expectation. 7/10",V-H-S
10,Scarecrow-88,Video Violence Anthology,4,24 August 2016,"Watched V/H/S (2012) for the third time and I can certainly say that it digresses with each viewing. I do think there's the idea, concept, whatever, that is a cool nostalgic tool that appeals to us of the video age. Those of us who dealt with rough recordings/copies of movies both made by us and rented from elsewhere get a bone tossed at us by those who also spent their time experiencing the scratchy, glitchy, video quality, with all the tracking problems and irksome degeneration of the tape. But glasses being able to record a demon obliterating his drunk and horny friends while the wearer tries to flee her advances and a ""glitch psycho"" picking off teens in the woods (think your tracking problem turned into a phantom who is wicked with a knife (what he is and how he came into existence isn't elaborated) don't quite capitalize exponentially on the concept. In and out appearances of murdered friends of a girl recorded from a previous visit to the woods and what is being captured present seems as questionable even if jarringly unsettling. The chilling idea of snuff on film is rather effective in and of itself, but glitch killers carrying them out is rather dubious. Boring touring footage of a couple in Arizona going about their travel exploits and how the wife might not be quite so happy in the marriage (as evidenced by what someone else does to her husband) doesn't thrill as much as remind me of the inundating dullness of watching everyday life. Only a brief scourge of knife violence to a throat jars the banality. Halloween hi-jinks by dudes looking for a party and inadvertently interrupting an exorcism unleashing a house invaded by dark spirits levitating people and objects, with hands reaching from walls, as they drag a girl out of the clutches of folks hoping to rid her of evil plays on Paranormal Activity films, including the grim finale where a car ride escape with the wrong passenger brings on a train...this is closer to what currently exists than a throwback to the days of 80s/90s youth. Vandals damaging property and stealing tapes from a dead man's home, who just so happens to turn into a zombie for whatever reason, as a wraparound and excuse to have others survey the recordings that make up the anthology, features shaky footage at its worst. Yeah, no legs for this found footage offering which earned plenty of pop upon release and word of mouth.",V-H-S
11,Hey_Sweden,An interesting if not very successful venture.,6,24 December 2012,"A collection of genre filmmakers get together here to put their stamp on two distinct sub genres: the anthology film and the ""found footage"" film. It's very big on style, but very short on sense. While it wallows in enough gore to please undemanding horror fans, it's often too incoherent for its own good, and is in serious need of characters who aren't insufferably annoying. Its twists are sometimes amusing but never terribly surprising. All in all, it runs hot (or at least warm) and cold. It doesn't help that the dialogue, which often sounds improvised but which is not so hot throughout, is too frequently consisting of characters loudly talking over each other, rendering their adventures less than completely absorbing. It's too bad, as this melding of sub genres could have had more impact and could hopefully have said the final word on ""found footage"" cinema.The wraparound story, otherwise known as ""Tape 56"", has a young pack of lowlifes hired to break into a home to retrieve a valuable video tape. Instead, all they find is a dead old dude and a multitude of tapes each containing their own weird tale.""Amateur Night"" revolves around a group of kids who go clubbing and hook up with girls including one big eyed gal who is even weirder than she first appears to be.""Second Honeymoon"" sees a man and woman on vacation who find themselves menaced by some unknown person.""Tuesday the 17th"" is in the supernatural slasher vein as a stereotypically dumb group of kids venture into the woods and talk of some local legend that turns out to be very real.""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"" stands out for a not bad gimmick of consisting largely of Skype conversations. It's more intriguing than the other stories here in this viewers' humble opinion.""10 / 31 / 98"" is not particularly imaginative scriptwise, but it boasts the most startling effects of all the segments. A bunch of guys head for a party and get the address wrong - VERY wrong.Also suffering from a too abrupt and less than satisfactory ending, ""V/H/S"" should be entertaining enough for some horror fans but overall is not as much fun as one might like it to be. It does have its moments, but not that many of them.Six out of 10.",V-H-S
12,preppy-3,Great horror anthology,8,19 November 2013,"A bunch of horror tales that we see on VHS strung together by a bunch of hooligans breaking into a house to steal a VHS tape. First up is ""Amateur Night"" with a bunch of 20 something jerks going to a bar, getting two girls drunk and bringing them home to have sex. However one of the girls has a surprise for them. VERY bloody with female and male frontal nudity. Easily the best story in the movie. Next is ""Second Honeymoon"" about two people on a honeymoon being stalked...sort of. Slow and meandering but the ending was surprising. ""Thursday the 17th"" is obviously a homage to slasher films. A bunch of brainless college kids go into a forest and are killed off in various ways. The killings are gory and the ending unexpected. Next is ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"". It's about a woman being haunted by a ghost. It has a few good moments but ended up being confusing with plenty of gratuitous female nudity. Easily the worst segment. Last up is ""10/31/98"" about a bunch of friends going to a Halloween party at an abandoned house...and getting more than they bargained for. It starts slow but REALLY works at the end. All in all a good horror anthology that scared me.",V-H-S
13,utgard14,Surprisingly OK Horror Anthology,6,19 December 2013,"Found footage horror anthology film with each segment made by different directors. The only significant one of these directors is Ti West, although he directs one of the weaker stories in the film. V/H/S features five stories plus a wraparound story. The film begins with this story, about a group of thuggish punks who videotape themselves committing crimes and being generally depraved. They are hired to break into a house and find a particular videotape. In the house they find a corpse and a ton of videotapes they must look through to find the one they're searching for. This brings up the first complaint about the movie. It's called V/H/S and they are specifically looking for a videotape, yet most of the segments in the film were clearly shot on digital camcorders or, in one case, webcam.The first of the tapes watched is ""Amateur Night,"" about a trio of douchebags who go out looking to pick up girls. One of them is wearing some kind of camera glasses. They meet a couple of girls and take them back to their hotel. Only one of the girls is a real weirdo who turns out to be some kind of monster. ""Second Honeymoon"" is the second story, about a husband and wife driving through Arizona on a trip. While staying at a motel, someone enters their room at night without their knowing. This is the segment directed by West and is pretty worthless. West seems to believe that being a filmmaker means just recording people talking about random things rather than following a coherent script. Laziness as art, I suppose.""Thursday the 17th"" is the next story and it's a pathetic slasher film variant about a group of friends going camping when something starts killing them all. Worst segment of the film. Next is ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"" and, despite its faults, is probably the segment that entertained me most. And no, it wasn't just because of the gratuitous topless scenes. The story is about a couple that stay in contact via webcam. Strange things are happening to the girl as the guy helplessly watches. The last segment, ""10/31/98"" is about a group of friends who go to a Halloween party and encounter strange goings-on. This is a good segment as well, with some nice build-up and characters you don't loathe as much as the previous segments involving friends.Overall, mixed bag as anthology films often are. The only story I absolutely hated was the slasher film story. The first segment, which seems to be the most popular from what I've read, was OK but didn't impress me much. Ti West's story about the couple on their second honeymoon is forgettable. The last two segments, while the best, are nothing spectacular. The wraparound story is a bit of a mess with a few unanswered questions left dangling.",V-H-S
14,Boba_Fett1138,A fine modern take on the anthology horror sub-genre.,7,8 August 2012,"Seems that most people are split on this movie. Guess it's being a case of you'll either love it or hate it. And even though I most definitely did not loved this movie, I was definitely able to appreciate it and like it for what it was!At least thing you can say about it, even if you didn't liked it, is that it's taking an original take on the found footage genre. I definitely mostly got fed up with this genre, some movies ago already and grew tired of movies using hand-held, shaky cams. It worked out quite well for this movie however in my opinion. It worked out successful because they combined it with a classic horror sub-genre; the horror anthology genre, that basically is being a movie with a bunch of short and individual segments, each often featuring their own story and characters, like this movie does as well. The stories on their own probably wouldn't had been solid or original enough to turn into a full length movie but as shorts they are definitely bearable and even have plenty of good elements in them. It's always a sort of a problem that these type of movies often featuring 1 or 2 truly good and successful short stories and the rest is being just average, or even below that level. That's not really the case for this movie though. Each story has something good and interesting about it and I can't really name 1 that stands out or was being below average. It's a pretty consistent movie all the way through, even while the stories aren't being really connected and each one got done by a different director and cast & crew involved.Can't really say this is being a very scary movie, unless you're one of those persons that easily gets startled by a sound in the background or stuff that gets only implied. It still has a great classic horror feel to it, even though its taking a modern approach. I also sincerely therefore do believe that most horror lovers shall be able to appreciate this movie and might even fall in love with it, as many other people already seem to have done. There is also still being a decent amount of gore and some good effects present in this movie.The whole concept is being still a bit faulty though. I mean, it's sort of ridicules once you start paying attention to it, as to how much stuff got filmed by the characters in this movie. Nobody ever thinks about stop filming and start becoming busy trying to run or survive. But that's just something that is an integrated part of the found footage genre and something you more or less have to take for granted, when watching a movie like this. It also was sort of annoying how nothing ever really got explained in this movie. It doesn't explain where the monsters or killers came from, or what they wanted exactly and what happened after the camera's went dark. There just hardly is any background for any of the stories. Most people won't be troubled by this though and will just have a good time watching this, like I, for most part, did as well.In my opinion nothing more and nothing less but an enjoyable and fine modern take on the anthology horror sub-genre. No doubt that it shall spawn a couple of sequels or rip-offs. After all, these type of movies are fast and cheap to produce and highly profitable.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",V-H-S
15,view_and_review,Don't Watch Random Video Cassettes!,7,1 January 2016,Let me ask this: has anything good ever come from watching random videos in unusual places? Some young adults committing a crime stumble upon some old video cassettes. They decide to watch them and wind up witnessing some horrifying events.There were several different videos shown and each of them unique in its own way. They were all similar in that they were creepy. A couple were supernatural and another was just two bad people. The variety adds to the movie because you're not locked into one story line.I'm normally not a fan of found footage films but it seems they are getting better and better and this film is no exception.,V-H-S
16,Uriah43,No Coherent Plot,4,24 February 2014,"Three hooligans are hired to break into a house and retrieve a VHS tape. Once inside the first thing they see is the body of a dead man in the living room in front of several television screens. While two of them are searching the basement the other young man in the living room finds the tape in a VCR and plays it. He then watches several film segments of gruesome homicides which were recorded first-hand by the victim or perpetrator of these murders. Naturally, because these killings were taped by different people using their own individual video recorders the footage is extremely garbled and shaky. Obviously, this technique is done to give the appearance of a first-hand account of these killings similar in great measure to ""The Blair Witch Project"". However, the downside to this approach is that the overall quality of the movie typically suffers in the process. And so it is with this particular movie as well. Add in the fact that there was no coherent plot which managed to tie these unrelated murders together and the end result was something that made very little sense to me. Accordingly, I have to rate this movie as slightly below average.",V-H-S
17,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Deceptively terrible anthology effort,4,12 September 2013,"Hired to retrieve a collection of VHS tapes from a stranger's house, a group of friends find more than they bargained for when they review the stolen merchandise.The Good Stor(ies): Tuesday the 17th-Taking her friends out to the countryside, a girl tries to help her friends uncover the truth behind a disturbing incident from her past. When it soon dawns on them there's a strange killer in the area, a deadly secret threatens to destroy the group even before the vicious killer does. Frankly, this one alone makes it on the strength of it's twist which is far more sinister and shocking than anything that's depicted in the segment, for it's quite illogical, full of nonsensical reasoning and completely avoids the guidelines set- up throughout merely to play-up a specific gag or idea that requires it to bend the rules already set up along the way. That really hampers the few positives here, as the killer is absolutely cool-looking with a fantastic premise, the kills are bloody and graphic and the scenic location is put to good use as there's a lot of rather creepy scenes coming from the location as well as the traps being put to good use. Just a shame about the story surrounding it all.10/31/98-Hearing of a great party on Halloween night, a group of friends head out to the rumored spot but get lost along the way. Arrived at the supposed house only to find it deserted, and a search to find the others causes them to stumble upon a demonic secret the likes of which will torment them as they try to escape. This is easily the best entry in the film and really makes this one worthwhile for there's a lot going on with it. The initial set-up is certainly the best of the entries as there's a decidedly creepy old-school approach to the feelings surrounding this type of set-up, and the crawl-throughs of the empty house is unnerving and chilling. The scenes amid the cult ceremony are quite creepy overall especially since we're the last one in the group and don't have a clear shot at the whole affair, making it all the more different. The real plus, though, is the final ten minutes which is just flat-out chilling as there's just an endless series of animated hands reaching out from the walls and ground, ominous fog moving through the house and a frantic race to get out before the house seals itself off, followed by a wicked twist on the outside. Sure, the gags they play on each other in the house are lame and stupid, but this makes up for it.The Bad Stor(ies): Amateur Night-Dragging their loner friend along, a group of guys find some girls at a night club and bring them back to their apartment. When they realize one of the girls isn't what they seem to be, the remaining guys try to get away before she comes and gets them. This is probably the one that could've gone further up on the list had it actually fixed the fact that none of the guys in this are really that interesting enough to carry the entire segment. It's virtually impossible to determine who's got the camera with all the activity going on between everyone. The twist is fine and generates some really chilling moments in the haste to get away, but it's not nearly enough to make up for the grievous flaw elsewhere.Second Honeymoon-Going out on a road-trip together, a couple decide to film their journey and all the crazy shenanigans they happen to along the way. When they arrive at a hotel, strange things force them to confront the truth about the journey there. This is entirely worthless as a segment, there's no horror to it at all, nothing happens in terms of scares or even action along the way and the twist is seen coming a mile away. Unnecessary to even be included in the segments and has no point that redeems it at all.The Sick Things that Happened to Emily-While deciding to Skye together while he's away on business, a woman notices strange beings in her apartment. Trying to investigate alone brings her to the harsh reality of the incidents and his behavior towards her. This is another one that really could've been close to being up-top, but it's just undone by the lame premise of the entire thing being done over the internet chat while the others on here were hand-held found-footage segments, leaving this one quite curious as the odd-man-out. Still, the goings-on in the apartment are inherently creepy, the multitude of twists are genuinely freaky and the whole affair has a dirty air to it. It just has a lame set-up for it.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, several sex scenes and drug use.",V-H-S

They have to break in to a house and steal a V/H/S tape with something on it, but they aren't told what it is. While in the house they find way more than just one tape, so they grab as many as they can and they start watching them. But what they see on these tapes is more than they can handle, and it's also hard to believe. But will it cost them more than they bargained for, and most importantly, will they rewind the tapes?...Its been a while since there has been a horror anthology, so in that respect, if you forget that this is basically a found footage movie (which has been done to death) you may appreciate it a lot more.The two stories that start and finish the quest are easily the best, amateur night being the overall winner, even though you can see what's coming a mile off.The other three stories are fair to middling, but the Skype story is just too bizarre and gets boring very quickly. The fuzzy serial killer story has an eighties vibe to it, but is too short, and the second honeymoon segment is really good, but just leaves you feeling depressed, rather than exhilarated.The wraparound story is dull, we basically just have a group of guys running around lifting up women's tops and filming it, not very sinister.So all in all, its a welcome return to the horror anthology, but as always, there are some very weak links, that outweigh the other stories.",V-H-S

All the other segments achieve varying degrees of success, 'The Sick thing...'

20,trashgang,too long with interesting moments but also boring ones,6,11 September 2012,"OMG, this is a hard one to review. I mean, it fits perfectly in the POV found footage movies but it's just a few stories fit together in one flick without any explanation or whatsoever. It's just a bunch of burglars breaking in into a house to find a rare VHS but by doing so they only find a corpse and a lot of weird VHS, the one we see, without knowing of course that something is wrong with the house they invaded.It clocks in at almost 2 hours and that was a bit too long. There are parts that you just want to pick up your remote to skip a few scene's but on the other hand you want to know what's going on. It do delivers on the gory site. Intestines and slashing do occur in front of the camera. If they should have made it a bit shorter this would be awesome. Sadly I never had the creeps, a thing Paranormal Activity 3 did at the end. But what it did deliver are some nasty shots and the red stuff do flows frequently. I was also surprised to see that amount of nudity in such kind of flicks. Hannah Fierman as Lily goes full frontal and walks around almost all the way naked, but don't think it's erotic, she do has another thing to show. And know and then you have gratuitous peeping tom nudity. It's even male and female nudity that there is to see.As I said, you do want to know what's going on but a real story there isn't. The weirdest must be the one in the woods. The most boring was the part with the webcam even as all girls do show their juggs.

I hate Hollywood's big spending and clichéd work just as much as the next man, but films like V/H/S make me fear the moment Indie films also become cliché, only really cheap.This is not really a film, either, just a collection of shorts held together by a flimsy story with really annoying characters. There were some nice bits in there somewhere, but hidden in a general horrible mess that was all filmed with handhelds. And at times the ""footage"" was broken by unexplainable defective parts or scenes that had no way of getting there.Bottom line: this has to be one of those ""OMG!"" campaign films, when they try to convince you it is a brilliant and scary movie _before_ you actually get to see any part of it, because if you go that road, you can't possibly enjoy it.",V-H-S

It seems the hippest thing to do today is to pay homage to horror styles from decades past, and that is what V/H/S's ultimate goal is; to bring us back to the past. It mainly wants to revive the bleeding style that went into many horror films that were shot on Betamax, super 16mm, VHS, camcorder, etc, where as another anthology horror piece, Chillerama, which pampered someone like me, was more concerned of lampooning the most baffling aspects of cheesy horror films. It's safe to say, both work on their own terms.Again, the only way to efficiently grade an anthology film is to look at each of the segments individually, rate them accordingly, merge them together to give an overall score, and then determine if the experience is worthy enough for a person to sit through the lesser shorts in order to get to the better ones. This one is, and even its weakest short will summon a smile to a nostalgist's face. We start things off instantaneously, in the mix of static, blue-screens, fuzziness, shakiness, and everything else that made hand-held camcorders so unique and primitive.We begin with the central story arc, following a group of underprivileged delinquents who enjoy committing acts of vandalism and sexually harassing women right in front of their boyfriend's eyes. They are sent by an unknown person to retrieve a VHS tape called ""Tape 56."" The group of thugs enter into a strange house and begin to watch the abundance of tapes that are there in order to find the right one.Our first short is by David Bruckner, titled ""Amateur Night,"" about three friends who go out clubbing one night, with a camera hidden in one of their eye-glasses, at an attempt to hook up and have sex in their rundown hotel room. They pick up two girls, one of them has bug eyes and a soul-penetrating stare. This will, as we assume, lead to some deadly, however familiar consequences. This is the weakest short by far, mainly because of its traditional feel and its intent on following conventional little quirks found in many recent paranormal films. The effects are good, especially the cinematography, which is one thing to praise about all the shorts, the atmosphere is present, but there isn't too much to note and it becomes an ""over before you know it short"" unusually quickly. Not to mention, I grew very weary of the incomprehensible camera-work early on.Next up is Ti West's ""Second Honeymoon,"" a short revolving around a married couple, vacationing in the west, where they encounter a woman who asks them for a ride (off camera). After politely declining, we see the couple being stalked by this unseen figure throughout the night, with gruesomely satisfying results. West is clearly shaping up to be one of the revivals of the horror genre, already creating a smart exercise in ""slowburn"" horror filmmaking with his film The Innkeepers. He is intent on atmosphere and slow-moving suspense that, more often than not, ends with a cherishable bang. Great work here.Glenn McQuaid's ""Tuesday the 17th"" is an exercise in gorgeous cinematography, showcasing four friends who vacation down to a cabin in a remote woodsy area, where one of them tells the story of how murders were committed around these parts. The other friends dismiss the stories as tired fables, but the girl is dead serious about a black-cloaked man who wanders the woods, causing frequent technical glitches in the video camera they take along and choppy sound and video whenever he appears. The short is just what it should be; eerie, unfamiliar, and intriguingly suspenseful. Possibly the only one that could've spawned a feature length film.Joe Swanberg's ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"" is next, and the short is a bleeding gums exercise in style and subversive horror filmmaking. The entire short is shot on a computer screen, with a woman and her boyfriend talking in separate windows via webcam. The woman is frightened when she believes her apartment is haunted, and that paranormal demons have come to claim it. An eye-rolling idea, certainly, but terrifically executed because of stylistic intentions. Swanberg's fascination with human communication, his interest in subversive tactics, and the lack of the incomprehensible camera-work (traded delightfully for steadiness and clearness) makes this a thoroughly enjoyable short and the film occupies a twist that you may might not have seen coming, no matter how many horror films you've seen.We end things with Adam Wingard's ""10/31/98,"" a favorable, yet familiar short in the world of horror. The short follows four friends (one with a nanny-cam conveniently hidden in their costume) who head to a stranger's house for a costume party. Upon their arrival, they notice the house is deserted, but find in the attic that suspicious men are assaulting and mutilating the guests.Regardless of quality, V/H/S never leaves its roots or abandons its idea to recreate a low budget film in homage to the camcorder days. Even if I didn't particularly care for one of the shorts, I didn't find one of unwatchable quality and always found something surprisingly interesting in each one. This is a fun little romp through the anthology genre of horror. It will also serve as a nice introduction to those who have no idea what the anthology genre is.Directed by: Adam Wingard, David Bruckner, Ti West, Glenn McQuaid, Joe Swanberg, and Radio Silence.",V-H-S

24,Red-Barracuda,Excellent found footage horror anthology,8,29 June 2012,"Some folks might be a little deterred from seeing V/H/S when they learn it's a found footage movie. Well, rest assured, there's nothing to worry about as this is an excellent example of the sub-genre. Perhaps at the root of the film's success is its structural format. It's an anthology movie, made up of a selection of short stories based around a series of videotapes found by burglars at a scary house. While some of the segments are better than others, where this one scores is that even the weaker stories contain some very scary moments. Each and every one delivers the goods in this respect and that's half the battle when it comes to horror flicks. The different stories are basically disturbing in the way that the best found footage flicks are, in that we are literally put right into the shoes of these people and their terror transmits more easily.I won't reveal many details of the contents but, amongst other things, there is a vampire, malevolent ghosts, a supernatural serial killer, a house invader and a weird ritual. There's a skillful combination of visceral and suggested horror. From the former there are several scenes of blood and guts including a beheading by knife and some disembowellings. But it's the mysterious moments that create the genuine tension, such as sinister figures seen briefly on camera, strange sounds and general weird goings on. The combination with both styles of horror is very successful. Overall, I have to say that this is a rather fine example of a recent horror film. It's genuinely unsettling quite often and the anthology format means that no idea overstays its welcome. It's definitely worth catching this one.",V-H-S
25,KineticSeoul,"Had ""potential"" but...",5,7 March 2013,"This movie had the potential to be a excellent horror movie but it turned out to be just mediocre at best. The rawness of it really stood out in the beginning but it quickly started to lose it's momentum as it progressed. The plot is about a group of dis-likable misguided misfits that go around messing around with other people and vandalizing stuff for the heck of it. Getting on a task to a creepy house to bring back some VHS tapes for some cash. When they arrive they start viewing the tapes and show 5 different tapes. The thing is, it's basically 5 different horror stories, well maybe 6 if you include the story about the misfits finding the tapes. It has a good start but started to get sloppy with some parts not making much sense and contradicts itself. Out of the 5 horror tapes they find 3 of them stood out in my opinion. The first one is raw and cool and very creepy. The second one is very slow with not a good enough twist at the end. The 3rd one has been done many times in other slasher movies, except this goes in a slightly different direction. In fact all of the tapes has that generic horror movie elements going for it, except it goes in a slightly different direction. The 4th one is bland and felt more like a comedy, not a funny comedy but a comedy. Th 5th tape is kinda cool despite it not being all that raw. It's cool even though the scenarios in it has been done way too many times in other movies. The dull part is that I sat through the 5 build ups to get to the horror aspects of those 5 stories. And some of the build ups are just so darn boring. The actors and actresses in this did a fine job even if there is a chance they ad-lib a lot of it. And didn't really seem like acting but real people, some immature people but felt like real people. It should have just went in a direction where they just claim to show 5 different found footage movies in a row instead of that whole plot about the misfits finding the tape in my opinion. The 5 stories are alright and some of them are actually creepy, but just wasn't as scary or as raw like the beginning of this movie made me think. And few of them is pretty dull. And the worst part is that the 5 stories don't even interconnect at the end. At least in ""Sinister"" there was some effort to interconnect the different grisly tapes. There are some creepy imagery but lacked that creativity and rawness to make this one stand out.5/10",V-H-S
26,Hellmant,One of the best 'found-footage' flicks I've ever seen!,9,7 December 2012,"'V/H/S': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An anthology of 'found-footage' horror shorts written and directed by Adam Wingard, David Bruckner, Ti West, Glenn McQuaid, Joe Swanberg and a team of four filmmakers calling themselves Radio Silence. It compiles six different ultra low budget horror short films (filmed in the 'found-footage' style) all revolving around one story in which a group of burglars are hired to steal a VHS tape from a house and come across a collection of tapes all telling their own grisly tale of murder and mayhem. Each short is supposedly filmed on VHS and is filled with video defects (giving a classic 80s horror style feel to each one). The cast is all unknowns and the directors each have a limited amount of experience but I found the film (as a whole) to be one of the best 'found-footage' flicks I've ever seen. It's extremely effective!The film begins with a group of young criminals who harass people (filming them topless) and vandalize private property in order to get it on tape and sell it for a few bucks (like $50 a video). They're hired by an unknown third party to break into a house and steal a special VHS tape. Upon breaking in to the house they find not only one VHS tape but several and as they look through them (to find the one they think they're looking for) they see a series of grisly murders (and other strange happenings) on each one. As they're filming their own actions they also become involved in their own strange and violent 'found-footage' tape.The 'found-footage' genre has kind of been overdone but this movie really works. Not only does it have that really classic old school 80s horror feel to it but it's also kind of scary and it's definitely disturbing. Obviously if you're not the type of person that ever really gets scared by a movie it won't have that effect on you but if you really let yourself get caught up in the universe of the film it's definitely creepy and nightmarish. Some shorts are better done and more memorable than others but as a whole the movie really works. If you like horror films (even if you don't generally like 'found-footage' horror films) you're almost sure to enjoy this film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD9BHpPUnE8",V-H-S
27,thesar-2,I Miss Tapes. (I do.),8,15 June 2013,"I also miss when found footage was lost. But, then again, of the 20, or so it seems, cheap found footage movies released each year, one usually is good. Only one.2012's was V/H/S. It finally took a spin – no pun – on the now overused genre and combined it with the classic anthology story. And very nicely, especially since they seemed to touch a lot of the horror genres as of late using an old format with creative ways.Basically, there are five completely separate stories and one wraparound. I will list my thoughts on these from best to worst. And by worst, I mean only one was meh; the rest were good to really rocks.1. ""Amateur Night."" Funny, when I watched, though didn't review, V/H/S a while back, I watched this one and thought it was just okayuntil the sh<>t hit the fan. Pretty much, I sat up and paid attention when the secret and horror is revealed. It helped there was full frontal male nudity, but that was incidental to the horror in the hotel room. And those bug eyesdamn!2. ""10/31/98"" Not so clever title and I'm not one for exorcism/haunted house stories, but this one rocked and is a VERY close second to ""Amateur Night."" A plausible story, a great house, very creepy and excellent graphics. Especially – again – for someone who doesn't get spooked easily or constantly rolls eyes with these types of stories.3. ""Tuesday the 17th."" I grew up with Jason at Camp Crystal Lake. Okay, I didn't, personally, but his films, yes. So, this incredible twist on that genre, though not 100% of what I wanted, worked for me. It was also great as a short. Just enough to peak interest and move onto the next story in this overall movie. Again, helps that the cutest of the two guys gets nakedI have a one track mind.4. ""Tape 56"" – The Wraparound. While not great, it's interesting enough. To be honest, I wasn't sure how it completed endedand this is from two separate viewings. I have an idea, and it does help the overall multi-genre theme. You have despicable guys and inevitable deaths. So, no hard feelings.5. ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger."" Too long a title for an ""okay"" story. Reminded me a lot of what The Twilight Zone would've been with an R-Rating. Interesting to a fault, but way too confusing and easy, yet creepy conclusion.6. ""Second Honeymoon."" Good for being in AZ (don't see that often,) mentioning an unexpected Vegas stop, theGRAND CANYON! hello! and one extremely creepy, though unexpected twist half way through, but overall boring. I get the ""other main twist"" at the ending, but way too much build up for just that. Sure, he was cute, but this is the weakest of all entries. Mercifully, it's early in the show and perfectly placed because after the great first segment (""Amateur Night"") you don't know what to expect following. And you have many more parts that get progressively better.Overall, I did like this whole movie and it was a nice break from the last time I saw it – I had forgotten some of the twists, so it was like seeing it for the first time. It's not one I would want to watch repeatedly, but every once in awhile, I would like to revisit. Especially without reading my own review and being surprised again. See it!",V-H-S

This review will be a little different then the others I have done. This will be different because the movie was different. This first off isn't really a movie at all.

The 1st one is nothing but sex and gore. the 2nd is ""Paranormal Activity"" like. 3rd one is a generic college kids on a getaway movie. 4th is a haunted house seen from a Skype point of view and the 5th is like a Twilight Zone type. Everyone of of these little movies started off OK but everyone had an anti-climatic ending and left you more and more disappointed. This really is for hard-core horror fans only.

Had I seen this one on a Public Access station (which no longer exist in this area), I might've been in a more forgiving mood- but having to PAY to see this kind of s*** just p***es me off. Sure, I know better than to buy into the hypocritical hype that ensues whenever something new gets released, but I thought I'd give this one the benefit of the doubt. Big mistake. One of the major problems with this alleged movie is that, like all too many movies these days, very little genuine THOUGHT seems to have gone into the screenplay. Do none of these filmmakers READ? Reading stimulates the imagination, triggers juxtapositions that make for new and interesting stories. Simply watching movies isn't enough: too many are too thoughtlessly cranked out with little or no imagination. (And television is even worse.) Go to the library, find a second-hand bookstore- do SOMETHING to jump-start your imagination. (My slug-line was originally W/T/F/?, but some cyber censor warned me not to ""shout"" in my slug-line.

The concept should've worked, blending the recent ""found footage"" sub-genre with an anthology narrative structure, providing not one but six terrifying short stories.

A gang approaching an innocent woman to film them sexually harass her, a group of friends wanting to record a amateur porn video, a husband wanting to record his wife undressing, two guys making innuendos towards a blonde teenager in the middle of the woods and a creepy boyfriend who clearly adores a good sexualised video chat (complete with female nudity). These are just five of the six stories, each of them obviously encompassing the same distasteful theme. Sure most of these characters gain their comeuppance, but if these short stories are shot from their perspective then there is no investment to be made. They are all unlikeable. The horrific camerawork with constant glitches only adds to my frustration with this film. It is simply unwatchable. Aside from the final short '10/31/98', there were no scares or suspense. One of the VHS tapes is a recording of a video chat on a Mac (makes no sense). The acting was mediocre, particularly the video chat sequence. Honestly could that guy look anymore less in love? The frame narrative strings the short stories together with no cohesion. And a nearly two hour runtime felt like five hours. I appreciate the anthology structure allows new directors to have a chance at showcasing their talent. But this was not the way to do it. Each short got progressively worse and my boredom levels and lack of patience increasingly heightened. A wasted concept with squandered potential. I'm just waiting for the inevitable 'D/V/D' to be released...",V-H-S

36,kevin_robbins,Overall this is a solid new age found footage film that is also a short story anthology.,8,13 July 2021,"V/H/S (2012) is a movie I recently rewatched on YouTube. The storyline involves a group of friends sent into a house to retrieve VHS tapes. Upon entering they find a dead old man and more tapes than they expected. As they look for the right tape they find unbelievable stories of death on every VHS in the man's house. There were 10 directors that collaborated to make this film, including Ti West (The Innkeepers) and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (Ready or Not), and stars Hannah Fierman (The Unwanted), Simon Barrett (You're Next), Lisa Marie Thomas (The Walking Dead) and Joe Sykes (Dead Silent). This movie contains solid short and big picture storylines. The first story is my absolute favorite and really gets the movie started off well. The house is eeries they initially break into and keeps a level of intensity throughout the film whether something is going on or not. The death scenes are great throughout the storylines, especially in the second and third short stories. Loved the flashbacks of the pain of accidentally recording over VHSs with things you wanted to keep on them. The ending of this movie does a great job of closing the loop on the film and making sense of everything going on. Overall this is a solid new age found footage film that is also a short story anthology. I strongly recommend seeing this and would score it an 8/10.",V-H-S

38,GiraffeDoor,Even the two good segments are shaky (1 & 4). The bad ones are torture.,4,14 April 2019,"Before I decided to write this review I decided to check Wikipedia to check I remembered all the shorts. So they're certainly not all memorable enough for me to not do that.I remembered people taking about how this movie had one specific section to recommend it and I decided I would amuse myself by trying to guess which one it was since I couldn't remember the title.Turns out I guessed wrong. Everyone else felt that the first segment ""Amateur Night"" was the most memorable. It would have been my second choice; it comes from a good place; its set up is awkwardly paced and it ruins itself by being a bit too heavy handed, but flashes of what it could have been remain.I would have said the fourth (of the five) segments was the best one. ""The sick thing that happened to Emily when she was younger"". A disquieting sequence of almost innocuous video chat exchanges that is let down by two things: being far too willing to show the audience what should have only have been glimpsed and being a bit vague in its end (but if you do get it, it's a great ending). Not generic horror though.There is one more segment that is mildly respectable and that is the second one (Second Honeymoon). A lot of it is filler but it gets creepy soon enough even if it goes nowhere with it.The other two segments and the wraparound don't deserve to have anything said about them. beyond that they are Just dull, hysterical, nonsensical, lazily written trash with nothing fresh or intriguing about them.My final score is not an average taken from the segments and wraparound individually. This anthology was a failure but try to tape it and after ""Amateur"" fast forward to ""Emily"". That's my advice.",V-H-S

40,drownnnsoda,Inconsistent but surprisingly unsettling at times,7,1 August 2013,"""V/H/S"" is another entry in the found-footage subgenre of horror films that takes the fundamentals of the subgenre and conglomerates them into an anthology without any particular purpose. The film is made up of a series of five different ""videos"" that are displayed to the audience through an overarching narrative (also presented in gritty video format) that has a group of burglars searching a house for a cache of video tapes. Each of the five segments include paranormal terrors and homicidal violence, with no apparent connections, and are each directed by a different indie filmmakers.Unlike some reviewers who felt this was a rehash or poorly done, I actually enjoyed this film tremendously. Given the trend of found-footage horror that has run rampant since ""The Blair Witch Project"" pioneered the style in 1999, ""V/H/S"" stands as an above-average entry into this subgenre. As someone is a bit jaded when it comes to horror films (it takes a lot to even mildly perturb me), I was surprised at how many points in which this film got under my skin; the lingering shots of the mysterious harpy at the bar scoping her prey, the killer in the motel room filming the couple, and the bizarre ""10/31/98"" segment that gets creepier by the second are just a few moments here. The hand-held cinematography give it a snuff like quality, and the ""Honeymoon"" entry contains perhaps the most realistic murder scene I've ever seen on film— I actually had to look away from the screen.Granted, there are weaker segments— the ""Tuesday the 17th"" segment is some weird play on ""Friday the 13th"" with a supernatural killer that is visible on camera only in digital bits, and has perhaps the poorest acting of all the segments. The webcam segment was also not particularly compelling to me, and also posed a bit problematic considering the film is purported to be made up of videotapes, not webcam recordings, but I suppose this is something that can be overlooked for the sake of suspending disbelief. It did, however, have a chilling ending; all of the segments did, in fact. Not a single one has a resolute conclusion, and the film as a whole piece is the same way. The connection between all of this randomly projected footage is never explicated, and the overarching narrative is also unusually ambiguous. Loose ends are around every corner, but the ambiguity generates an uneasiness — we don't know how or why the tapes came to be, what their connections are, or why they are all in one isolated house with a dead man on the couch. It's all left so unexplained that the gaps in the narrative in a sense are part of what makes it frightening.Overall, I liked this film. It's a fine spin on the found-footage genre, and the anthology presentation gives the film some integrity and variety; obviously this poses one problem, and that is a lack of consistency, as each segment is done by a different director, but each of them are competent enough and at the very least are intriguing. It's a perfect watch for a Halloween party or something of the sort; the lack of cohesion makes it something that doesn't necessitate your complete attention. 7/10.",V-H-S
41,TdSmth5,Almost enjoyable lost footage,7,7 July 2013,"Four thugs spend their time harassing couples and destroying homes and of course they film it all. They are then hired to break into a house and steal a VHS tape, they'll ""know which one"". They get into the house, find a dead guy sitting in front of screens and lots of VHS tapes. While the rest of them explore the house, one stays with the dead guy and starts watching tapes. The movie shows what he finds on those tapes.Segment 1 is about three friends who installed a camera on glasses for one of them to wear while they go out to pick up girls and film the encounters. They end up picking up two girls, one pretty one, the other a little weird. She just stares and tells the guy with the glasses that she likes him. They take them to a hotel room where one guy gets busy with the pretty girl who ends up passing out. Since the guy with the glasses doesn't do much with the weird girl, the other guy takes over and wants him to watch/film. Weird girl seems amenable at first but ends up attacking the guy, while the others hide in the restroom. She ends up killing two guys and trying to be nice to the guy she likes. But she isn't just an ordinary girl.2) involves a couple going on a road trip. One night someone breaks into their motel and steals his money. And another night somewhere else, the guy is attacked.3) is about 4 friends one a road trip to the woods. One girl half jokingly keeps talking about killings that happened there and how her friend was killed. And indeed, there is some killer/ghost on the loose.4) A couple spends their time video chatting. He's a medical student. She's a little strange, sees things, develops a bump in her arm that she tries to cut out. It turns out there is something/someone in her house and only the guy can see it when she turns the camera toward the rooms. But then she is attacked.5) takes place during Halloween when four friends drive to a party somewhere. They reach the house but nothing is going on. They explore the house and finally find some people in the attic. They have a girl strapped and it looks like they are about to cast out demons. The friends think it's part of a Halloween gag until they realize it's for real. They free the girl, but the house won't let them leave. Finally they escape with the girl, but she too, isn't who she seems to be.In between these segments we go back to the thugs in the house and they too see something in the house. And all these tapes aren't new but re-used so we see some of the original footage- a guy trying to film a sex tape, some guys having a BBQ.The entire movie is shot POV and very, very shaky. In particular the segment framing all the others as well as the first segment. Of all these movies this is the first one that was truly nauseating in that regard. All of the segments have a surprise/twist in them. Segment 1 is the strongest of them all offering a story that is original and a twist that came out of nowhere. Segment 2 offers very little aside from some stunning scenery and a good death scene. Segment 3 is alright. It benefits from being filmed during the day. Because some of the others take the darkness to extremes. Segment 4 is a bit lame, watching people video chat isn't all that great and it takes away the one benefit of the POV perspective. Although the story is pretty good, but I'm not clear what it was all about in the end. Segment 5 was pretty good, too, once the action started and it was neat to see the house come alive. The segment of the thugs was a bit pointless and unfinished.Every time I watch one of these lost footage movies I end up hating them more and more. Not so with V/H/S though. We have to admit that this subgenre is about one thing only- making a movie as cheaply as possible and making a ton of money. And it usually shows, because the audience gets nothing out of it, but feels cheated. I have to commend the filmmakers because they put a lot of effort and work in this movie and you feel like you got some of your money's worth. Also commendable is the fact that for once someone tried to actually improve things. And it's a brilliant idea to use this format for an anthology instead of condemning us to spend one and half hours with the same 4 or 5 morons as they scream at each other. In fact, some segments here could even have been shortened without losing much.At the same time V/H/S suffers from all the same problems that all the other movies in this subgenre suffer- stupid dialog and awful visuals. At least we didn't get nightvision, but instead we get near zero lighting. Despite using these same techniques there aren't any jump out of your seat moments. This movie focuses more on the stories. And once we get to the action things improve dramatically and all twists are pretty good. There are some original ideas here and that is always welcome. Even though I know little about how these movies are made, I still wonder, what would happen if they discarded the grainy, unfocused and shaky visuals and gave us sharp, focused, and steady visuals instead? Would that completely ruin the tension and scares? They can't keep giving us 80s and 90s lost footage forever. At some point they'll have to figure out a way to film things looking more sophisticated while still being scary.",V-H-S
42,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,v/h/s (2012),8,26 August 2012,"I love found-footage films, especially when they are done well. I also love horror anthologies withe some of my favourite TV shows being The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, and Tales From The Darkside. The two joining together for V/H/S was a very exciting idea and gave me very lofty expectations. I was amazed to find that for the most part they were met. V/H/S sees a gang of guys break into a house in order to steal a video cassette for blackmailing purposes. Once in he house they find a huge collection of videos, each one showing a different tale of horror. The first is the story about a couple of girls picked up from a bar and recorded secretly on camera glasses. This is probably the scariest tale with some very disturbing imagery. I still can't get the look of a certain character out of my head. In it's short running time it also hits upon some emotional notes that I wasn't expecting. Perfect effects and nailbiting tension make this a great start. Video number two sees a couple on a road trip who are secretly filmed at night. The idea of an intruder watching you at your most vulnerable is nerve-racking. Story number three was my least favourite but was still mostly effective. It was let down by cheesy dialogue that over explained the details of the plot. The effects here were again very well done with a sickening look at an eyeball sliding out of a socket. Story number 4 is shot through Skype and has the biggest ambitions in terms of plot. I would like to see this again as I didn't enjoy it at first because of a terrible performance from the male lead, but there is a reason for this which makes sense after viewing. The final tale is a haunted house film that builds up incredibly well. It starts with an empty house and moves towards all hell breaking loose with some of the most flawless effects I have ever seen. Each story was interesting and most importantly it kept to the rules of found-footage. Everything appears as though it was done in-camera. It's left me thinking about the stories and getting my imagination to work overtime as not a lot is explained. The only real let down was the wrap-around that tried to connect these stories. It really didn't work and just made the film a bit too long. When I buy this on DVD I am pretty certain I will be skipping those parts. Hope we see a V/H/S 2.",V-H-S
43,RatedVforVinny,Should have turned out way better.,5,24 April 2020,"Despite the up and coming collection of Directors, who all individually went on to make superior movies, 'V/H/S' could and should have been a stronger selection of horror tales. Like 'Blair Witch', the 'Gonzo' style camera work is way too shaky and makes me sea sick rather than scared. You can hand hold a camera perfectly still, so these films make a fundamental mistake of deliberately shaking it around. The viewer simply becomes disorientated. I'd range each segment between 4 and 6 out of 10 and even the one directed by the great Ti West, is pretty mediocre.",V-H-S
44,brando647,"An Awesome Horror Collection if You Can Forgive the ""Found Footage"" Style",8,1 February 2013,"Man, I know I've often mentioned how little love I have for the found footage genre but I keep coming back to movies that give me reason to defend it (e.g. CLOVERFIELD, TROLLHUNTER, CHRONICLE). And now I've come around again to talk about how much I enjoyed a movie in a style that I really could do without. V/H/S is a horror anthology that I first read about when it debuted at Sundance at the start of 2012, and everything I read mentioned how terrifying it was. The reviews were encouraging but it all comes down to the fact that I'm a sucker for a good horror anthology. Horror most often works best for me in small doses. A lot of feature-length horror movies have a lot of filler with shallow characters and a bunch of garbage that gets in the way as you're waiting for the crazy stuff to start. An anthology trims out a lot of the lame stuff and generally jumps right to the action because the filmmakers only have about 20 minutes or so to get everything across to the audience. V/H/S is a collection of five stories contained within the premise of a group of thugs hired to break into an old home and steal a mysterious videotape. The home is all but abandoned, with the exception of an old dead man sitting in front of a bank of stacked TVs. The problem: there's a lot of videotapes scattered about the house and they don't know which to grab. So they begin watching them, and so we come to the individual talesA quick note about the foundation tale with the thugs in the home, directed by Adam Wingard: it's the most aggravating part of the movie. The dialogue doesn't come naturally to the characters and it all sounds rehearsed. The mysterious happenings around the house are never really explained. Worst of all, it's shot in the darkest sets in the movie so it's a lot of extremely shaky camera work in a low light environment. Thankfully, we don't get a lot of it because it's just the framework for the good stuff in the middle.""Amateur Night"" – One of the best stories in the whole film. It's gets the anthology off to an awesome start. The footage is collected from a pair of video glasses worn by one of three friends who are heading out for a night on the town. They hope to collect some drunk women from a bar, bring them back to their hotel room, and record their own little porno, incognito. Their plans go to literal pieces when they meet Lily (the beautifully creepy Hannah Fierman, with haunting eyes). The effects are great and I assume anything that wouldn't have looked so good was hidden by the POV-camera style. When recommending V/H/S to friends, this is the short I try to use as a big selling point.""Second Honeymoon"" – This short is from the only recognizable director (well, recognizable to meI'm sure genre fans might know them better) on the list, Ti West. Despite this, it was the weakest story of the bunch. The story of a married couple trying to rekindle their marriage on a road trip through the West, it's mostly a bore. There are a few good moments of tension but there is so much extra, ""candid"" footage that I was bored. When the big finish came, it was pretty gruesome to witness but happened so fast and was so dissatisfying that I was disappointed with it all.""Tuesday the 17th"" – Now, this one was creative. It starts like any of your normal slasher films, with a group of friends traveling to a remote lake in the middle of the woods except one of the friends seems to have a hidden agenda. When the violence starts, it's brutal and the effects (both practical and computer) are just excellent. I loved the unique take on the ""creature"" that hunts its victims and can only be seen in the glitches of a video camera. Creepy, gory, and it gets to the action at a good pace so you don't become bored with the shallow characters. Another gem in the collection.""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"" – This short isn't that great, but it isn't that bad either. The entire segment is a series of Skype conversations between Emily and her doctor boyfriend who lives in Michigan. Emily believes her house might be haunted, but her boyfriend isn't so sure. Emily has a history of bizarre episodes. Still, there might be more to her problems than she understands. Honestly, I didn't understand what exactly happened in this segment until I sat through the end credits and had it spelled out in the cast list. It's all right, I guess.""10/31/98"" – The V/H/S collection ends on a high note with this twist on a classic haunted house tale. Directed by four dudes who go by the name Radio Silence, the four directors themselves star in the short as a crew of friends going out on Halloween night to attend a costume party and wandering into the wrong house with freaky results. The effects are at their best here with better haunting effects in this little short than I've seen in some big budget horror movies. A great finale to the collection.There are definitely more hits and misses in V/H/S and I was pretty creeped out by the end of it all. I don't often walk away from a horror movie with the feeling of dread and uneasiness as I did with this movie. The found footage aspect is a turn off to most people, no doubt, but this one is worth checking out.",V-H-S
45,rivertam26,Has it's moments,6,14 August 2012,"How this film hasn't been made before this I'm not sure. With the boom in popularity of the found footage angle it's surprising that this is the first anthology to come out of it. Sadly the execution makes for a mixed bag of tricks and treats. It would be pointless to go through each segment as that would ruin the surprises of them but there are some good bits in here. The first story proceeding the surrounding one is pretty cool as is the last one. Most of the others don't make much sense especially the second one concerning a couple on a road trip staying in hotel rooms. I can appreciate the creativity that went into a project and it's inspired to see the passion on display here. But the film would have worked better had it been focused and not such a hodgepodge of horror movie clichés and nightmarish imagery. Anyone knows me knows I'ma huge fan of the found footage angle I find the execution to be addictively watchable if done believably which it is in this film. That being said although interesting the stories vary in such quality and such open endedness there's no finality to the product leaving you feeling incomplete and unsatisfied. Still one can't appreciate the inspired bits of a video sensitive woods slasher and a intriguing trip through an actual haunted house even if they don't go anywhere. sadly, mostly all of the men come off as one dimensional pigs(excluding the final story) and the women are overly sexualized with unnecessary amounts of nudity. Although there is some appreciated male nudity throughout as well and speaking of unnecessary there is also a fare amount of unnecessary gore having very little to do with the incidents surrounding. All in all it's a mixed bag but has enough solid moments and an engaging watchablity to merit a slight recommendation. But it doesn't even come close to delivering the promise of having these talented indie horror directors Ti West, Adam Wingard and Radio Silence amongst others work together or the exciting heft of their concept. ***/5",V-H-S
46,suite92,Thieves review ever more horrifying tapes in order to get paid.,1,9 November 2013,"This is a collection of shorts. In the ruling arc, thieves are hired by an anonymous third party to steal a rare VHS tape from an isolated house. The thieves find a dead body plus a host of VHS tapes. They watch the likely tapes to find the target that will get them money from their employer.Tape 56 (directed by Adam Wingate): The opening shows a small crew of petty thugs filming while: forcibly exposing a woman's breasts in public, vandalizing an abandoned building, being intimate with a girl friend who does not know about the camera. They discuss rates. Fifty bucks for each porn incident, and so on. One of the crew recommends jump shifting to loftier crimes that pay better. They line it up, and that starts the adventure of finding that one special tape. They find a dead older man plus VHS tape players. Beyond that, they find a supply of video tapes to sort through.The thugs meet problems that they cannot solve.Amateur Night (directed by David Bruckner): Shane and Patrick setup Clint with 'video glasses' so he can record what is in front of him. They go to a bar and pick up Lisa and Lily and proceed to a motel. Lisa soon passes out. Patrick only sits and laughs. Lily wants to do things with Clint, but he shies away. Shane takes off Lily's dress, which was all she was wearing. Clint gets enough courage to record Shane and Lily. Patrick is still wobbly, but he takes off his clothes so he can sandwich Lily with Shane. Clint runs away again; Lily bites Patrick. Lily is straddling Shane as Clint approaches again. She's morphed into a vampire. Things end very badly for Shane, Patrick, and Clint.Second Honeymoon (directed by Ti West): Sam and Stephanie go on a road trip in the desert of the American West for their second honeymoon. They are recording a tape for future memories.These are two germaphobes on a field trip who stop at cheap jack motels. Clever.Sam wants to record Stephanie while they are making out; she demurs. Sigh. Turn the camera off and record later. Knock at the door; it is some girl who asks for a ride the next day. The figure Sam saw earlier quietly breaks in, steals 100 USD from Sam, nearly cuts up Stephanie's underwear while she's still in it, but makes a clean, silent getaway.The next day they discuss the loss of 100 USD, but do not figure it out. They do some sight-seeing and plan the remaining parts of the trip. That night, they get a visitor who films them again. This time, she kills Sam, and records herself kissing Stephanie. Ah, pro-lesbian PC, plus anti-male PC.Tuesday the 17th (directed by Glenn McQuaide): Joey, Samantha, Spider, and Wendy are on a field trip. They stop by a lake for a drug smoking break, then go swimming. Wendy tells a story about a killer who took out four people by the very same lake. Then she laughs it off. Spider and Samanthe get a giant knife through their brains. Wendy gets the camera, then returns to Joey, and asks him to have sex with her. Things do not turn out well for Joey or for Wendy.The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger (directed by Joe Swanberg): Weird things happen as Emily and James have a video conference. She refers to a time when she and James were apart when they were young, and bad things happened to her. He should have recorded their chat the second time when the weird noises start. She uses a Kodak on her living room and catches the figure of a child. She asks the super of her apartment about previous deaths in her apartment. No such thing; the only renters were students without children. That night he records, and several figures are captured on the chat. They start a partial dissection of Emily. James is in cahoots with them. James keeps communicating with her, and never lets her know what a complete traitor his is. How can this turn out? Was Emily the only one James is abusing?10/31/98 (directed by Radio Silence):Four young adult males (Chad, Matt, Tyler, and Paul) go to a Halloween costume party. They bring a nanny cam. The house where the party is to be held has an unlocked door with the lights on. No one is at home. They keep looking for the party.They call out for their friend Justin, who should be there, but no such luck.They hear voices in the attic, and think that is where the party is. They find several men torturing a tied up woman. At first they think it is the party, but the torturers very much convince them it is not. They run away at first, but decide her trouble is for real, and go back to save her. That sort of works until she leads them into more problems.-------Scores------Cinematography: 2/10 Features low-end cameras, bad framing, insufficient light, bad focus, and terrible lack of contrast. Then of course, there are shaking camera movements, anti-relevant POV, and old bad recording media. One of my least favorites is where the camera is left on to record time going by in a room where nothing moves, often in complete darkness.Sound: 5/10 Who cares? More often noise than anything else: audio chaos to go with the video chaos.Acting: 0/10 The only actor of note is the camera. The camera trumps the efforts of all actors.Screenplay: 2/10 Boring. Short on plot. Badly executed with next to zero motivation. Worst of all, not the least bit scary.",V-H-S
47,thekarmicnomad,A rare gem of converging formats,8,5 February 2014,"This film combines two styles that can be pretty hit or miss - namely Found Footage & Anthologies.This plays out like a gritty version of 'Tales from the Crypt'.The tie-together is supplied by some shady hoody types committing a burglary who stumble upon a pile of old VHS tapes. As one of the gang watch the tapes so the anthology unfolds.Two things to understand about the format. Found Footage is a good way to make a movie on the cheap, perfect if you haven't got a zillion dollar production company behind you, so don't expect a lavish production.Having an anthology means you get lots of stories for your buck but as each is only about twelve minutes long they tend to be quite sparse on detail.Well I loved this! The acting was superb, the stories quirky enough to keep be interested and quite a few lovely ladies made the effort to take their tops off.The stories are short and sharp, spending the majority of time constructing the characters then following up with some nudity or gore then the shock ending. The gore is not particularly graphic or distasteful, which fits the feel of the movie well.As the genre goes I have not seen much better than this.

49,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""V/H/S""",8,1 October 2012,"To be honest I did not know what to expect when I set down to view this film. At first I though ""oh- another found footage film-cool"". The title alone conjured a lot of nostalgia of glory days running to the vid store to pick up my fair share of 10 rental/ 3 day load of horror flicks. So that alone made me want to see this film. Beyond that bit of pointless stream of consciousness I didn't have high hopes for the film. Oh ME of little faith! A collection of short films from some of the best todays horror come together to create some truly inspiring and original views of nightmares and dreamscapes that I have ever seen. This is done in a found footage premise that begins as epic and simplistic as performing a covert task and awakening Satan himself in the process.""V/H/S"" Starts with a simple story of breaking & entering and theft. A small crew is hired to still a simple v/h/s tape. However they enter a realm that is far darker than any Rod Serling could dare to dream of. It is a collection of short and twisted delights envisioned brilliantly and uneventfully by the likes of Ti West, Joe Swanberg, and Glen McQuaid to name a few of the disturbed minds that have gathered in this truly demented Night Gallery. Each on of these directors pull us into the lives of every day people going about their lives who just happen to cross paths with a horrific fate by supernatural means. The stories are dark and at first seem simple enough. Friends on adventures or moving into life changing moments of time that unfortunately venture into a world plagued by psychotic killers, winged demons, and paranormal attacks. I was so wrong to doubt that this film would be anything but awesome. The segments are intense and pull you into the lives of the characters long enough to make it emotional and intense to see the massacre unfold. The string of episodic nightmares flow perfectly with interludes of terror that press upon the cast in the back story – the thieves. This is truly one of the best things ever to come out of the found footage explosion in genre film making and probably an instant cult classic. For me it was like watching a fictional ""Faces Of Death"" tape with the same nail biting, tense enjoyment watching and waiting for the carnage to begin. ""V/H/S"" is definitely in the top 5 of stand out horror films to come out this year. I enthusiastically say see it.",V-H-S
50,Rob-O-Cop,I like you,7,13 October 2012,"A good little movie if flawed by its format somewhat. I thought the acting was pretty good all round, in some cases exceptional. The format was interesting but also ended up backfiring on the overall movie. having multiple directors contributing clips lead to the film bloating in places as each director used the same crash found tape edit technique, so we had to sit through a bunch of stuff that wasn't necessary and slowed down the overall film. The found footage technique also got in the way of some good stories. especially amateur night which although the confused nature of the events helped the vibe of the piece it passed the line on a few occasions as to what was actually happening.Hannah Fierman was awesome in this piece though, a believable weird scary sexy beast. perfectly paced performance.Helen Rogers was also very good in her piece.I particularly liked how they didn't bother explaining every detail, bad stuff happened, no back story, here's how it went down.On the whole these were inventive stories with enough to keep you guessing and leaving enough to your imagination to make the trip worthwhile. could have been 20 mins shorter though.",V-H-S
51,bryank-04844,'V/H/S' Is fun and scary as hell.,8,22 July 2015,"Here is the next attempt at POV filmmaking that films like 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Paranormal Activity' made famous. Over the past few years, we have seen a huge increase in the shaky cam films in other genres than horror. These types of films are oozing their way in to the comedy and drama genres slowly but surely. This might be the first attempt at a horror anthology type of film, one that when it does well, the hairs on the back of your neck will stand on end. However, when it misses the mark, you will laugh and want to fast forward to the next segment.The first segment is called 'Amateur Night' and is directed by David Bruckner ('The Signal') and follows three douche-bag college guys whose only goal at this point in their life is to get girls drunk and have their way with them. One of the guys constructs a hidden video camera in his eye glasses so that they can film the night's debauchery. After a night at the bars, the three guys end up bringing two girls back to their hotel room in hopes for some sexual contact. However one of the girls immediately passes out from too much to drink, while the other girl known as Lily, who seems to only utter the words ""I like you"" is not who she seems to be. She has big, round, black eyeballs and a giant scar in the middle of her forehead. Things go from sexy time to blood bath very quick, with some truly horrific images. However, due to the extreme unlikable characters in this, I couldn't sympathize with them. I think this would have been a little better if the three guys in this segment were somewhat redeeming.'Second Honeymoon' is the next segment up by director Ti West ('House of the Devil') and comes across more as a murder mystery than a genuine horror film. That being said, West is a master of suspense and slowly builds it till you are on the edge of your seat. This segment centers on Sam (Joe Swanberg) and Stephanie (Sophia Takal), a young newlywed couple who are road tripping it through Arizona and video taping their romantic journey. The seemingly happy couple end up at a small motel where Sam is trying to get his wife naked on camera. At one point, a strange girl knocks on their motel door and asks for a ride the next morning and then leaves. We cut to the camera being turned on at night as the camera shows Stephanie fast asleep in bed. I think, ""Finally, Sam will get his wish"", only to find the camera then turning to show Sam fast asleep as well. This is the only segment that has a HUGE twist ending, one you won't predict.Next up is 'Tuesday the 17th', which is clearly a shout out to the 'Friday the 13th' franchise and plays out like a typical slasher film from the 80s. This segment is directed by Glenn McQuaid who is known for his film 'I Sell the Dead'. Here, we get the stereotypical teenagers who are in the woods on a camping trip. But, they are not alone in the woods, for there is a paranormal killer on the loose who seems to teleport from place to place and kill off each of these teens. This is your basic comedy/horror segment, which is neither scary nor funny, due to the poor dialogue and non-scary villain. This is my least favorite of the segments.Next up is Joe Swanberg's 'The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger'. Swanberg played Sam in the previous segment 'Second Honeymoon'. I thoroughly enjoyed this segment, mostly due to the way it was filmed. The entire piece is filmed via Skype on two laptops with web cams. We are introduced to Emily (Helen Rogers), a likable and somewhat crazy young woman who talks with her medical student boyfriend James (Daniel Kaufman) who is in another state. Emily starts to tell James that she thinks her place is haunted and brings the laptop with her to investigate the strange noises and paranormal activity going on. Emily thinks she is going crazy and all of these things are just a part of her imagination. With a few truly bizarre twists and turns might make us think different. I wish this segment had a bit more time to develop the story, because with the short story we are given, there are more questions than answers that arise and ends up being less scary. But this is a good attempt.The final segment is my favorite. It's titled 10/31/98 and is directed by a group of directors who go by the name Radio Silence. This particular segment has the most special effects in it by far, and fortunately, all the effects look very good and convincing. Here, we center around four friends in their late twenties on Halloween in 1998. One of the guys is wearing a teddy bear costume which doubles as a camera, back when the nanny-cam teddy bears were all the rage. The four friends head out to a supposed Hallowen party at a stranger's house. Upon arriving, the large house seems to be empty, although as they are walking around the house looking for people, the things that go bump in the night tend to show its ugly head. The four guys make their way up a hidden staircase to the attic where they witness what seems to look like a cult sacrificing a virgin. But when the cult members start getting sucked out through the ceiling, and objects are levitation and being thrown around, and windows are mysteriously disappearing, this virgin is not who she seems to be.",V-H-S
52,lopezpatricia-06139,VERY / LOW / STANDARD of filmmaking,1,6 December 2020,"This review deserves 4 bad ones as it was 4 of us that watched it. It is three different stories all of which bare no resemblance to the other. The camera is shaking so so much that you can't make anything out at all. When it gets to a so called good part they put fake interference on the screen. Ultimately trying to disguise the crap gore special effects. The whole film is teens screaming babe and dude into the camera and I can only deduce that people whom like this film are as tedious and annoying as the people on it. So all those good reviews are crap, trust me or don't and waste 1:h56 mins of your life.",V-H-S
53,dfa120374,Decent Addition To The POV Genre,6,15 January 2015,"Three guys are hired by an unknown person to recover a VHS cassette from a house, but after finding the occupant dead and a large collection of tapes (and not knowing the name or label of the cassette they're after) they're forced to view individual tape contents to find the correct one. But as they look through different tapes they find a lot more than what they were expecting.V/H/S is a member of the POV genre of movies and the main story includes the contents of five different VHS tape recordings. The different contents are...1) three guys on a night out get more than they bargained for after picking up two girls; 2) a couple on vacation together are stalked by a stranger; 3) a group of four people take a trip to the woods that they'll never forget; 4) a woman thinks her house is haunted; 5) four guys going to a Halloween party end up being witnesses to something more sinister.Being old enough to remember what VHS tapes were like, I thought the way the POV was done was really good. It showed that kind of graininess & interference that the old VHS tapes had and when you combine that with what is happening in the film you get a pretty decent feel & effect.Another positive was the creep factor that some of the stories contained. Some of them do genuinely freak you out and for being such a low budget film a good few of the visuals were impressive, especially for the last tape which was my favourite of the five. The main story itself is pretty well done as well and brings it's own uneasiness in parts.The negatives, however, were that some of individual stories got a bit ridiculous. I don't want to go into too much detail for obvious reasons but they go along fine then suddenly that facepalm moment arrives. Also the majority of the characters in each story are a bit of a pain so you never really draw up much sympathy when something happens.Overall, this is a pretty good film and if you enjoy this style of movie then there's a good chance you'll enjoy V/H/S.",V-H-S

Though effective in horror as a device to avoid what would otherwise be phony moments of.amputation, castration, et al,, heavy breathing and screaming over a jerky camera is a style that's been done to death by now, so to speak, and the long stretches of lousy actors'improvisation passing for verite' between those frenzied moments make this way too long.",V-H-S
56,bregund,Why found footage films don't work,3,7 May 2021,"No one goes around filming all the time. The only time this worked was in Blair Witch Project because they were documenting, and even then at times it was a stretch. Cloverfield made FF even more unrealistic because who films anything as they're running for their lives. Stop and think about it, would you rather pump your crazy legs or stop and film whatever is about to kill you? In this film almost every single character has a camera. Why? If you lose the tape, it should make it easier for the police to identify the crimes you are COMMITTING ON CAMERA. Stupid. I could have forgiven all this if any of the characters were remotely likeable, but it's just one non-stop drunken frat party from beginning to end. There's nothing new, exciting, or innovative here.",V-H-S

58,nitzanhavoc,"So far the best ""live footage"" Horror flick I've seen, and I really dislike this sub-genre...",7,23 January 2013,"Just to be decent, allow me to start by stating that while I am a Horror freak who likes to give all sub-genres a fair chance (and enjoys most of them) I truly dislike the ""live-footage"" sub-genre. It was cool when The Blair Witch Project came out because it was original, innovating and artistic. By now it's overdone, overused and unnecessary (if you ask me). I really didn't enjoy REC and Paranormal Activity.Having said that, I must say that VHS has been a very pleasant surprise. As it started I was like ""oh damn, not another one of those!!!"" but decided to give it a chance after all, and I'm glad I did. VHS is an anthology, and is like five short stories instead of one novel. Each of the stories takes one of the human mind's deepest fears/paranoia and builds a story around it, and the story is told from the POV of a cameraman.I'm trying to think if this film could have been better as a regular anthology instead of a ""live-footage"" camera POV one, but it probably would have made some of the effects a little tacky and even amusing, which would have disturbed the sense of fear.The cinematography was great and really reminded me of how old VHS cassettes filmed with old video-camera would look. The acting was really great, and was very convincing. The direction by Ti West was excellent, showing us his talent of creating supernatural Horror as he had done in The Innkeepers. However, the best part was the screenplay, the writers really created some fine Horror stories, and surprisingly enough I really enjoyed watching this film.Thank heavens for IMDb's message boards, without which I wouldn't have been able to figure out part of what I've seen. While the explanations are accompanied by ""you're so stupid for not understanding, I'm so cool you'll never be as cool as I am"" remarks made by 9 year olds, they do clear things up. Pay no attention to the reviews, remember that 9-12 year olds are swarming the web, and you'll find most of your questions answered. Also, the VHS 2 thread has some pretty neat ideas for a sequel!All in all, while I don't enjoy the ""live-footage"" sub-genre, I did eventually enjoy VHS. If you're a fan of the sub-genre you MUST watch it, you'll love it. If not - give it a chance if you're feeling open minded, you might surprise yourself!",V-H-S
59,kdnor2011,A creepy fun time,8,22 September 2012,"As I have said before, I love the found footage style of filmmaking. Yes it has been done very VERY bad before, but when it's done right it can be some of the scariest stuff you've ever seen. And V/H/S prooves how to do it right.Now I will say this, it does have nudity, so if your offended by that you may not like this. For me, the main problem was that it may have been a little too long. It's nearly two hours which is pretty long for a horror film. I think it needed to trim the last one. It wasn't bad, but it disrupted the flow of the movie. Also it goes into that typical horror movie cliché of having characters do stupid things. And it did leave me scratching my head a few times.But this movie is scary, yes, I jumped quite a few times. There are some genuilly creepy moments that get a little hard to watch. The characters are actually pretty funny, I mean some of them are just awful people, but they made me sympithize with them. The special effects are actually really good, I'm not sure what the budget was, but it seems pretty low. There are some interesting twists in the movie that made me gasp. And is just a damn fun movie to watch.Maybe I'm at a disadvantage because I love found footage, but this movie was just a plain fun time to watch. A couple of the segments are just kind of meh, but when they are good, they are a creepy fun time. Oh, and let's just say the fourth story (not including the main one) is a little short of Paranormal Activity 4. No, I'm not kidding, watch this movie, then watch the trailer for PA4.",V-H-S
60,ericrnolan,Finally – a horror anthology that's worth its salt!,9,11 May 2015,"""V/H/S"" (2012) got mixed reviews from both fans and critics, but I personally loved it. I haven't had this much fun with a collection since ""Creepshow"" (1982); I'd give ""V/H/S"" a 9 out of 10.It definitely isn't for everybody. This is a collection of five violent, found-footage vignettes, all shot in low-quality shaky cam that even got on my nerves, and I usually don't mind it too much. It's gimmicky and low-budget, with brief ""urban legend"" –type stories that offer little characterization or detail. The quality of the acting was also wildly uneven, and in one segment was so bad that it was distracting.But, damn it, it worked. This was overall a hell of a lot of fun, with shorts that were raw and inventive. And all of this film's various flaws were more than made up for by its incredible first segment, ""Amateur Night,"" which might be the scariest horror film of its kind that I've ever seen. (I don't want to name its sub-genre because I think that even that would be a spoiler. Regrettably, though, I think the film's advertising sort of does let the cat out of the bag.) Seriously, ""V/H/S'"" first segment was goddam terrifying, and ought to be ranked right up there with ""The Exorcist"" (1973). This makes it worth the price of a rental alone. And I think this part was so scary largely because of Hannah Fierman, a talented physical actress who is also unusual looking.Seriously, if you're a hardcore horror fan, you owe it to yourself to at least give this a try. Ignore Roger Ebert's review. He was having a bad morning when he wrote it.",V-H-S

They discover his collection of ""found footage"", leading to a horror anthology.It's difficult to rate this horror anthology, because the quality is all over the place. Also, in many cases, I liked the ideas or concept much better than I liked the actual execution. Many of them seemed to be kind of amateurish, which I guess is one of the most common complaints about ""found footage"" films, going back to Blair Witch (which I did not like). In my opinion, the strongest ones were the first (by David Bruckner) and the last (by the popular YouTube collective known as Radio Silence).Very few (if any) of the characters in V/H/S are likable. Many of the characters are unrepentant douchebags and drunken idiots, and it's very difficult to feel any sympathy for them as they get ripped to pieces. If you're a fan of low budget slashers, this probably won't be a problem for you, but mainstream audiences may have trouble enjoying some segments.Unfortunately, each of the shorts is flawed in some way (some more than others), but they're generally interesting to watch, even if just to see what each director does with the gimmicky ""found footage"" concept.",V-H-S
65,nickmesafilms,"V/H/S (2012) - A Found-Footage Style Horror Movie! Doesn't that Remind You of Anything? Yeah, That's What I Thought!",7,29 September 2012,"Released early on demand, after it's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, ""V/H/S"" is a horror movie told through the ""already tired"" aspect of found-footage material, shown from the perspective of a hand-held camera. A group of hoodlums has been strangely assigned to break into an abandoned haunted house, and steal a particular V/H/S tape. But once making it to the house, they start to find a wide collection of plenty of V/H/S tapes, and we are introduced to a series of ""found-footage"" shorts, as the group starts to watch each tape at a time, as if the audience is in the room, with these guys, watching the tapes. Each tape has a different particular horror story, some work, and some doesn't. Let's recap each one! 1. A group of guys start to become haunted by a strange woman during a ""guys night out"" (Works), 2. A married couple on their second honeymoon, whom doesn't realize that a certain someone has been sneaking on them (Kind of works), 3. A group of friends being hunted down while on a trip to the lake (Hardly works), 4. A young girl communicates with her ""doctor-to-be"" boyfriend over the Internet, believing that her apartment is being haunted (Doesn't work), and 5. A group of guys awaiting an awesome Halloween party, but they got more than what they bargained for (Perfectly works). ""V/H/S"" is probably one of the most scariest, and one of the most disturbing movies I've ever laid eyes on. Filled with plenty of great scares, some disgustingly grotesque moments, and tons of scenes that will leave you speechless. Now, there are times when this movie follows almost every horror cliché in the book, and although this movie is supposed to be portrayed as a ""found-footage"" feature, the camera movements are a little too shaky. But, this movie does stay true to it's promise by giving such scares that won't let audiences sleep later at night. Although I prefer ""The Cabin in the Woods"" as the better horror movie this year, I prefer ""V/H/S"" as the better horror movie in the terms of scaring me, grossing me out, and leaving me awake at night! In ordinary horror movie fashion, there is plenty of great fun to be found in ""V/H/S"". I'm just saying you've been warned, because if you're somewhat interested in seeing it, I must warn you that this movie is sick and grotesque, leaving audiences in a stage of vomiting and sleeping with the lights on.

66,doug_park2001,More of a Good Film Spoiled than a Truly Bad Film,6,7 May 2013,"Four--or is it five?--young libido cases who enjoy filming themselves committing various criminal acts are hired to break into a house where they discover an apparently dead body and a slew of old VHS tapes, each of which portrays acts that beat them at their own game. The important thing to remember is that each of the apparently unrelated, gory, disturbing, and largely supernatural episodes in the middle portions of ""V/H/S"" represents a separate VHS discovered by the characters at the beginning; i.e., this film utilizes the same ""frame-story"" (little stories within a larger story) technique that was first used by Boccaccio and Chaucer and that has been used in a host of works ever since.The sad thing is, the premise for ""V/H/S"" has real potential; unfortunately, it's largely ruined by the standard ""found footage"" cinematography. While I understand that the purpose of this is to add realism, ""V/H/S"" would be a much easier, less confusing view without the shaky camcorder that keeps zooming in on the floor or some drunken person's face. Another frustrating point is that the main ""envelope"" story is maddeningly incomplete. This film is honestly fascinating in places, but it requires a LOT of patience.Other Considerations: --Good dialogue, even though much of it's from characters who can't complete a sentence without at least one f-bomb and one ""dude!"" --The various ""Special Features"" are worth a look. The commentaries reveal a great deal about what the creators were trying to accomplish here.--You've probably guessed as much, but lots and lots of blatant gore and nudity, even more than in other ""found footage"" flicks.",V-H-S
67,jmbwithcats,V/H/S (My Review),6,1 October 2012,"Only one bad story really, here's my full movie review:First of all a few of these stories could really be fleshed out into full length films, and I would definitely go see them. First story: 8/10 This one reminds me of Erotic Horror folktales I remember reading in some book at the library in the '90s. It was pretty clear from the beginning something was wrong with this chick, but that ""I like you"" line is very effective. Second story: 2/10 Sucked, have no reason to even write about this one. Third Story: 7/10 Reminiscent of ""Wrong Turn"" meets Predator, but as a found footage film. ""Why can't I film you?"" is a great line. The Woods actually could be fully fleshed out into its own movie, with the right script and director and actors, that could really be something to watch. Fourth Story: 6/10 (First impression) Girl with oddly shaped everything, and guy who's an emotion-less douche, have a Paranormal Activity rip-off experience but with an added bonus of alien abductions, implants and all, kind of liked it. Interlude Zombie House with Samurai? Fifth Story 9/10 The last story, seriously, the last story is amazing... I love those effects they are sooo good, and some stuff I've definitely never seen before, I don't even want to mention them because they were so badass! There were clearly effects stolen from other films, hands coming out of walls, rumble pack precursors, etc... but I didn't mind because I loved those effects originally and they used them well here. ~*~ Cons: In the beginning of the movie they're supposed to break into someone's house and steal a video tape, and they wonder how could the person who hired them know how to find them because their videos were all anonymous... I don't think any of this is answered in the episode... what the video tape is and how they were found to do the job",V-H-S
68,ragingbull_2005,Brilliant in parts,6,10 July 2013,"This is an anthology of six short horror movies. Five of them are stories within the central tale. They range from the truly bone chilling and mind numbing to the ridiculous.Three guys spend their time shooting videos for porn sites. They grab women, tear off their clothes and film the exposed body parts. They are hired to steal a V/H/S tape from a person. However, on reaching their destination, they find a dead body and a cache of these tapes. One of them begins viewing the tapes while the others go out to search the house. The tapes have on then stuff which is positively mind-fu*king.For me, the best segment was the first. Three college guys go bar hopping to pick up girls. The nerdy looking dude has these glasses which have in built camera in them. The story is told from his P.O.V. The horror is sprung suddenly on the unwary viewer. The end is absolutely fantastic. At the end of the segment, I was practically kicking myself for not viewing this earlier as I have had this movie for nearly six months.The second segment is about a couple who are on a holiday. Their stay in the hotel turns into something terrifying when a young girl shows up one day asking for a lift.The third segment shows four people going to a cabin in the woods. There is a legend of a killer who used to operate in the area. Is he still around? A girl is chatting with her boyfriend/fiancée on Skype. Some ghostly entity is visiting her at night. There is a mysterious bump on her hand. She starts showing him the ghostly manifestations using Skype.Four guys go to a Halloween party. However, the house is empty. Thinking it as a prank they go to the top of the house from where some muffled moans are coming. What do they find there? The last segment shows the date as 1998 which gives a valid reason for it to be recorded on tape and not a CD/DVD. It is kind of stupid to assume that someone would keep a Skype chat on V/H/S .But if one stops nitpicking about these small technicalities and immerses himself in the experience, he would not be disappointed.The majority of the stories are novel twists on old themes. The way they lure the viewer into a sense of complacency and then unleash doom is unsettling.This would have been a terrific horror classic if one or two segments would have been chopped off and there would have been a better end to the central story. The promise of the first segment is squandered away by the succeeding ones. However, this is a far cry from the pedestrian Evil Dead and I loved it for the twisted ways the stories unfolded.I read that the sequel is out and has garnered extraordinarily good reviews for a shoe string budget horror anthology. I can't wait to check it out.I recommend this to the viewer who has had his patience stretched thin by the recent crop of so called terrifying movies. Kindly watch this.

69,loomis78-815-989034,Give me a 1970's horror anthology anytime.,5,23 February 2014,"5 part anthology film has a wrap around story about a bunch of punks who are hired to brake into a house a steal a certain VHS tape. The tapes they watch are the 0stories within this anthology. ""Amateur Night"" opens it with a bunch of guys who ends up in a motel room with two girls they picked up. Lily (Fierman) is an odd looking one and is soon revealed as the monster she is below. This segment from Director David Bruckner has some nice shocks and decent jolts with a end shot that is quite memorable. Not a classic, but the few scares and twists of the plot start this off nicely. ""Second Honeymoon"" from Director Ti West stops the movie in its tracks with the story of a husband and wife on a road trip. The entire story is played for a twist at the ending that just isn't satisfying and not scary. The middle story is ""Tuesday the 17th"" from Director Glenn McQuaid. A group of youngsters go to a secluded spot in the woods where Wendy (Norma C. Quinones) informs them they will all die. There is an unseen force loose that picks them off one by one. This plays like a slasher film but an uninspired one. There is some gore but the killer leaves a lot to be desired. ""The Sick thing that Happened to Emily when she was younger"" from Director Joe Swanberg has a boyfriend and girlfriend chatting on line using skype. Emily (Rogers) feels her apartment is haunted. This story takes a few left turns and introduces aliens into it for mild results. It never really gets scary at any point but manages to be amusing with a average twist at the end. The final story is from group calling themselves ""Radio Silence"" and it is called ""10/31/98"". Set on Halloween to try to give this anthology film a little atmosphere, a group of friends head to a Halloween party. Upon arrival, the group thinks a prank is being played on them because the big house seems to be devoid of people. The house comes to life and begins to seal itself off as the group tries to escape. This tale is a bit of a head scratcher but has nice visuals and a spooky feel to it. Finally, Director Adam Wingard's wraparound ""Tape 56"" fails to bring any real scares on board and is simply just annoying. V/H/S/ more interesting on paper than how it plays on the screen. The five tales range from decent with some nice scares to boring or flat on stupid. As a whole, V/H/S/ is disjointed and isn't near the classic many are trying to make this out to be.",V-H-S
70,ApolloBoy109,Crap on a stick,1,26 August 2012,"Won't spoil anything - cause there's nothing worth spoiling. We've been here before. Nothing new. Move along now ... nothing to see.The idea of the shaky camera is really to hide all the directors mistakes while trying to pass it off as ""real"" and intense and happening RIGHT NOW! A cast of nobodies, directors no one has ever heard of -- but a darn good marketing team.Who wants to see flashes of a scene and then the camera twirls, someone screams, blood appears and we really don't have a clue what is going on. And after a while -- we don't care.If your movie has to rely on this overused ""trick"" of shaky camera and whirling motion you're covering something up, like a lack of a story (professional directing) and solid character development. This was a boring gimmick movie -But hail to the marketing team (those great spin masters) for talking about people getting ""sick"" - Right. Yeah, motion sickness.",V-H-S
71,TheRedDeath30,Mediocre Anthology Film of Found Footage,5,22 August 2014,"I have found that my opinion of this movie has actually decreased on repeat viewings. While I would never have said that this was anything close to being classic horror, I see more and more of the cracks in the facade as I watch the movie again.Anthology films are usually very difficult to pull off and probably the reason that we see so few of them. As a story, it's hard to get much character or plot development in the limited time frames, so the individual pieces generally come off as underdeveloped. An anthology, also, creates a typically uneven aspect as some segments will be better than others. The viewer's opinion, then, is usually skewed to what stuck out more. Were there enough shining moments to stick in the brain and make you forget the slow parts, or did the bad segments outweigh the good, burying the quality in your memory. Few horror anthologies successfully pull this off.This movie has a double (possible triple) handicap going against it, though. Not only is it an anthology, it's ""found footage"". There is always going to be a segment of the public that just hates the style of film making, or falls back on trite comments of its' overuse. I wouldn't put myself into the category. While I think it's generally harder to impress me in a found footage style, I don't have any bias against it. The triple whammy here is the dialog. Many of the film makers are attributed to the ""mumblegore"" style of cinema (I hate those silly terms but it bears noting) where they use ""naturalistic dialog"". That's one of my biggest issues with this movie. I understand that the directors want a lot of ad lib to create the feel of real people. The problem is that there is a reason Hollywood uses script writers. People ad libbing dialog rarely works convincingly and seldom comes off as natural, to me. They sound more like that guy in your high school who used to say odd, random things to get attention. They are acting even if they are pretending they're not acting, so why not just use some professional scripting.My biggest problem with the movie is that there really just isn't much original or creative that sticks in my brain as being memorable.TAPE 56 is the wraparound segment connecting the stories and a glaring example of bad dialog. The plot starts off with a promising idea of some young men who are filming ""real porn"", though it comes as being influenced a little too much by HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER. This idea probably could have been explored better but eventually devolves into a run of the mill zombie story.AMATEUR NIGHT is the first real segment. Again, the characters and dialog really pull me out of enjoying this. Several guys are out on the town looking for women to film a homemade porn. These characters are really annoying, one of whom does little but cackle throughout. In real life, you'd avoid these jerks, so why do I want to watch them? Maybe we hate them so much we want them to suffer? The story eventually settles into being a too close to copying Argento's Masters of Horror episode JENIFER.SECOND HONEYMOON is the worst of the segments, a shame because I really enjoy Ti West's movies. Most of it consists of us watching an uninteresting couple on their vacation. The climax is a plot point that's been done a thousand times, basically lover kills spouse so they can escape.TUESDAY THE 17th has an appropriate title bringing to mind reference to Jason Voorhees. I'm sure it's intentional because this is just your average slasher piece, with brainless teens being killed by a maniac in gory ways. The only new take on it is that the killer is fairly unique.THE SICK THING THAT.... is presented as a series of Skype conversations between a woman experiencing ghostly phenomena and her boyfriend. Essentially it's PARANORMAL ACTIVITY with a twist ending. The ending saved it for me and does present something creative and interesting, in a way that potentially gives ""real explanation"" for ghost phenomena. I don't want to spoil any twist here because it is worth it. This is one of the better segments of the movie.10/31/98 is probably my favorite segment revolving around a group of guys who are invited to a Halloween party that goes awry for them. I felt it was the only segment that ever really establishes any tension or atmosphere and culminates in some real fear moments, though it does stray a little too closely to the climax of HOUSE OF THE DEVIL.This is not a horrible movie and the fact that I've watched it more than once probably says something, but it's nothing earth-shattering either. I probably enjoy it mostly for the gore moments, which are good when they come, and help forgive bad characters, bad dialog and unoriginal plots. I, also, know that that's the norm for horror anthologies and few rise above. For one that does, check out the sequel VHS 2, which is an excellent movie and far better than this one.",V-H-S
72,berg-74532,Enjoyed it!,7,20 April 2020,"I've loved, hated, liked, hated, and have come back to enjoying the found footage genre or sub genre or whatever. And I enjoyed this even with a huge problem with story 2, I won't say much about what happens in the story because in this case it's easy to explain what my problem is without revealing any details so fear not this gives away nothing. My issue is that certain parts of that story would not exist on a found footage tape and while the overall story is not affected it's annoying. The stories at least to me are good some new territory is explored and told well. I recognized a face or two and even though IMDb was within easy reach I did not look and still haven't, but that's just me and I do it not to cloud my fellings of this movie or how they were in this movie. The follow up to this is good as well.",V-H-S
73,ghost_dog86,Watch people watch movies.,6,11 September 2012,"Even though the first thirty-five (or so) minutes of ""V/H/S"" is so virtually unwatchable that I almost turned it off, this new collaboration horror film (which is essentially six very separate short films) from directors David Bruckner, Glenn McQuiad, Joe Swanberg, Ti West, Adam Wingard and the team of Radio Silence, is one that is still riddled with a lot of redeeming qualities sure to draw the interest from both low budget horror buffs and novices (aka, those who thought ""Paranormal Activity"" was the scariest thing ever). V/H/S tells the story of a group of thieves hired to steal a rare VHS tape (aren't they all?) from the house of an old man. When they get to the house, they find out that said old man is a video tape hoarder, and so they must sift through (and watch) the mounds of tapes in order to find the mystic VHS in question. OK, so the overarching storyline of watching people watch movies is pretty nonsensical and the way the filmmakers incorporate the VHS aspect into these little horror shorts is, at times, quite far-fetched, but due to some very intriguing visuals (which will have many audiences completely baffled as to how certain effects were accomplished) and two borderline scary but quite entertaining story lines, ""V/H/S"" is worth checking out; even though it is so hit and miss, it can only be defined as slightly above average, at best .Since this is not your traditional narrative, the following is a mini synopsis of each short: 1. As I had made mention of prior, the first story is actually the overarching story following four thieves for-hire, who are given money by an anonymous client, to steal a VHS tape. This one starts the entire movie off rather poorly, as the audience must watch these rather dumb characters, do nothing but banter back and forth for fifteen minutes. And once they get into the house and begin watching the tapes, it becomes so predictable that this particular story can't end fast enough.2. The second story is actually the first tape played. That said, it is one of the worst horror shorts I have ever seen. It follows three ridiculously annoying and overwhelmingly loud frat guys, who go to a bar with the intentions to get laid. Once there, they meet a couple of girls who agree to come home with them. Seems like your everyday teenage, American Pie, date-rape movie right? Well, it would have been, if not for a twist (which is all together given away in the trailers) that's only purpose seemed to be to shock audiences. And while this twist does shock, it's not in a good way. In fact, the only interesting thing about this short is that in the beginning, the filmmakers establish that the frat guys have placed (or given the illusion to have placed) a camera in one of the men's glasses. But that rather cool, film geek aspect is quickly forgotten, as audiences are plunged headfirst into an aggressively vulgar horror story, reminding us all as to why the shaky camera/found footage genre is on life support.3. The third story (or the second tape played) from acclaimed Indie-horror director Ti West, is essentially the first film worth paying attention too. It documents a couple staying at a hotel on vacation, when a stranger comes to the door. With a deceptively simplistic story, West showcases what he does best (not counting ""The Innkeepers) which is Hichcockian suspense.4. The fourth story is one that doesn't really work at all, as far as the plot goes. In the ill-constructed tale, which follows a group of annoying teenagers venturing off to a cabin in the woods, it's pretty much all about the visual effects; which are coolbut only to a certain extent. This one isn't at all scary or even spooky, but it's not as unwatchable as anything in the first thirty minutes.5. The fifth story started off spectacularly strong, telling the story of a FaceTime conversation (or a rich man's Skype) between a couple (well kind of) via their computers. The woman has been experiencing paranormal phenomena for the past few nights and attempts to document it by showing these strange happenings to her ""boyfriend"", who is out of town at the time. Truly delivering scares and ghost effects that rival the likes of ""Insidious"", this is one of the rather compelling shorts that is absolutely ruined by an ending that is beyond absurd . In saying that, this may be one of the most technically innovative shorts, simply because of the way the filmmaker uses FaceTime. I know we have all seen the trailers for the dreadful looking ""Paranormal Activity 4"", but trust me, the effects via FaceTime in this short are on a whole other level of filmmaking than anything in the God-awful PA4 trailer.6. The final tape played is in fact the main reason to watch this overlong film (around 2 hours). Directed by a team of directors out of L.A., who call themselves Radio Silence, this segment follows a group of guys (all in their 20's) going to a Halloween party. But when they get there, they quickly find out that instead of walking into a Halloween party they may have just walked into an actual haunted house. From the fact that the POV camera is explained by having the protagonist dress as a nanny cam, to the brilliantly stunning low-budget special effects, the final short is essentially the found footage film (with the perfect amount of shaky camera) that I've been waiting for ever since this genre's inception. It's just a shame that horror fans will be forced to wait until the last twenty minutes of ""V/H/S"" to see anything truly innovative or new.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

74,tmccull52,Pleasantly Surprised,6,6 March 2013,"I honestly did not expect to like this movie. In fact, I started out not caring for it as I began to watch it. But, dagnabit, I ended up liking some of the segments very much, most particularly ""Amateur Night"", which featured Hannah Fierman as Lily. That was actually my favorite of the segments shown in the production. I didn't much care for the episode that dealt with the couple traveling through the American Southwest together, but that was the only portion of the film that I found to be disinteresting.I caught the movie on NetFlix, and I'd watched it primarily because I'd seen just about every other film offered in the horror category. I hadn't expected much from it, and mostly had it playing for background noise as I puttered about the house. But when the ""Amateur Night"" segment came on, I stopped what I was doing and sat down to watch the piece with attention undivided. I remained planted on the couch until the film was over.It's not the greatest horror flick that I've ever seen, but it's far from the worst.

75,lorcan-61881,Halloween Review #6: One of the scariest and best horror films for Halloween!,10,15 October 2017,"V/H/S explores a group of people who break in to a house trying to find a video tape recommended by some guy and when playing videos looking for it,they discover some disturbing videos that no person has ever seen. So,V/H/S is a pretty original film I think,well,at the time anyway. The films directors included Adam Wingard and Ti West,two horror directors that have tangled with each others films,making sequels for each other. The tapes included five,each one scary as hell,my favourite tape was probably Ti West's one where a couple are on holiday and I'm not going to spoil,but something very psychologically creepy happens. There was only one bad tape to me in the film and that was the third one,although,the thing is it wasn't actually bad it was just,not the best,the acting in the film was also very good considering it was from 20 something year old nothings. V/H/S is a brilliant,excellent creepy horror film that is very good for Halloween! Just going to review the second one,Now!!",V-H-S
76,dschmeding,You got to be kidding me,2,8 August 2012,"I wonder when this FoundFootage hype ever wears off. There is really not many gems among all these shaky cam documentary horror style films (all i can thing of are Poughkeepsie Tapes and Lake Mungo which were heavily story driven).V/H/S is no exception to the rule here. First... don't fall for the cheap promotion about people getting sick in cinema. If they did they did because of the annoying camera shake, not because of how creepy or sick this movie is. For a horror movie in 2012 this is laughable, both on the scares and the gore level.Honestly... the idea to make a FoundFootage anthology has to be one of the most idiotic ever. So you got a genre that seriously lacks storytelling already and then induce it with the additional cheesiness and storytelling laziness of anthology movies... this had to end badly.What you get is some episode pieces bound into a surrounding ""plot"" about some burglars out to steal some VHS tapes and watching them in a dark house with a dead guy in a chair.The episodes are barely worth mentioning. The first is about some guys out to party with a chick they pick up while one of them films secretly with a camera in his glasses and the whole thing goes boom when the chick turns out to be some kind of demon. This is the best in my opinion and it doesn't deliver much more than what I summed up. The gore is minimal, some of the effects are laughable even with the bad quality, dark picture and shaky cam covering most of it.One episode stands out for it using a skype video-chat and trying to tell a little story with a twist but although the actress is pretty convincing the twist just doesn't cover it. I can't find if its Adam Wingards part but it reminds of the basic premise of ""horrible way to die"".The last segment has some decent effects with a haunted house feel but honestly it feels like a ghost train in an amusement park with hands coming out of the walls and some boo scares.I don't get how these kind of movies always manage to generate such a buzz. Blair Witch Project was kind of new but this thing wore off years ago. Stop making such cheap cheese and make movies with a storyline, not with idiotic boo-scares and saving money on a camera guy.",V-H-S

78,TuesdayThe17th,"Great. Best found footage horror film since ""The Blair Witch Project""",10,19 November 2014,"Found footage has been responsible for some of the biggest scares in film history. Think of The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity. Even cloverfield. V/H/S takes found footage to a new level with an anthology method of presenting a genuine terrifying and realistic horror film. First of all, the reason found footage scares the crap out of us is because it seems all too real. What music used to do for movies, silence now does. This film alone will have you sleeping with the lights on and with one eye open for the rest of your life. Lots of times anthology films consist of multiple short films that make up one whole of a movie. This film tho, is made up of several short segments that make up one idea. All of the segments are connected to one background story. If you liked Grave Encounters or REC, then V/H/S is for you. If The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity scared you bad, then nooo way is this movie for you",V-H-S
79,DustinRahksi,Good Ol' trashy garbage.,5,18 December 2012,"I think more films should to be done in the anthology format, but of course they have to be done well, unlike this film. This movie is filth anyway you slice it, extreme violence and explicit nudity, all centring around young adults.The opening scene gets you in a bad mood to begin with, and you already wish death on a few characters. The pacing through the rest of the film is on and off. Sometimes it's suspenseful and other times it's boring as all hell. Some of the story lines didn't even make any sense, you will know what I am talking about if you ever watch the film, I don't feel like spoiling it. Some of the stories were stronger than others, such as the one in the woods, Some are more intense, such as the final one in the house, you will also be frustrated with the characters actions in this one as well.The characters all have the same personality, you could hardly tell them apart from the stories. They party, do drugs, are sleaze balls, show their boobs, swear constantly, do stupid things, and are downright trash, your typical horror actors and actress's. I can't believe some of these people did what they did, which was probably for a very small paycheck, oh well it is what it is.The stories consisted of ghosts, murders, goblin things. A fair variety in one film. The effects were good, there was some unsettling and great looking visuals. A good enough job with what seemed like a low budget. The gore was graphic and very bloody, such as a knife going through someones head knocking their eye out, or someone getting stabbed in the throat repeatedly. The shakiness of the camera gets annoying sometimes, and makes you wish for regular filming. Let's say the content in this film is on par with the recent piranha films.I would suggest renting it first, just in case you don't want to spend 15 dollars on Itunes.",V-H-S
80,Fields201,Found Footage At Its Finest,8,29 September 2012,"I'm half and half on the whole found footage genre. I like it when its effective, but when its not effective, I tend to almost be in the same boat as everyone else of getting tired of the genre. What amazes me about these found footage films is that when a special effect is shown, like say, someone flying the air, it amazes me compared to the CG garbage we see in Hollywood films. Even more, when an Indy filmmaker with a limited budget creates something spectacular on film (like Oren Peli did with the original Paranormal Activity) its fascinating.I watched V/H/S On Demand and I have to say I was put off at the intro. I didn't know what to expect from this film and I was already on border of dismissing this as one of those useless found footage films. It starts off with these guys raping and videotaping a woman for their own amusement. So already it starts off with us following unlikable characters that we want to see get their comeuppance. Eventually they raid this house to find some rare videotape for reasons I can't remember and this guy is alone with a dead old man sitting in front of a TV set. Naturally he just starts watching tapes. You know, I sure would in that situation (sarcasm).Then we see the first segment in the film. A bunch of teens are going out for a night on the town with intentions of finding hot women. A nerdy guy with a camera on his glasses tags along and eventually they find some hot dates. One of them has these really bulging eyes and she acts really weird. She's attractive, but very weird. I didn't think she would go along with him but she seems to like the nerdy guy with the camera glasses. They take these girls back in the motel and this section is where the film turned into awesome. My friend and I were literally yelling at the screen and some truly horrifying imagery happens. Seriously, this is some of the most creepy stuff I've seen on film for a while and it doesn't stop until the very end of this segment.The next segment is about this couple traveling on their Honeymoon. It's very slow moving, but a couple of creepy moments happen and a depiction of death that looked very gruesome and decidedly real happens.The third one is about a bunch of kids going out camping only to be bait for this killer that looks like a glitch on film. He also has a hard time dying. It reminded me of a small film I made a couple years back, but I did like the special effects that was given to this.The fourth one was pretty cool but can be confusing in the end. It's this Skype conversation between this girl and her boyfriend. Apparently she's been haunted and what's her boyfriend to witness it with her. Of course things go bump in the night and she starts to get weird. It's pretty effective to see everything through Skype instead of a standard video camera.The fifth one was pretty cool where a bunch of guys are trying to find this Halloween party and instead goes into this creepy house that I swear that I filmed in before. They walk into some satanic cult with a girl chained up to be exorcised. All hell breaks loose and crazy things happen when they try to escape. I love the special effects here and honestly, if that happened to me in that house, I would be screaming and running too.All and all, this is a very good found footage film. It reminded me of the old Tales from the Crypt and Creepshow movies that I enjoyed so much when I was a kid. It would be great if V/H/S turned up every Halloween with messed up stories like these. Halloween would be fun every year!",V-H-S
81,FKDZ,"Some work, most don't.",5,10 August 2021,"Overall this was an interesting movie. With its own mini movies aka a anthology series within itself. That said its lacks and sort of substance. The ''main story'' leads nowhere and stays incredibly vague. And the shorts within the movie focus too much in my opinion on setting the scene and not the scare.First off, if you hate shaky found footage movies, this has to be one of the most disorienting movies I've ever seen in the genre. Thankfully it lacks the cheap jump scares that normally go with it. But it'll make you annoyed that no-one knows how to how a camera straight for 5 seconds.The concept, is great. But its just that and nothing else. Some teen criminals just randomly decide to watch a VHS tape one by one.I do have to say, the gore and visuals are really good, and felt realistic up to certain amount. There is a lot of nudity (both genders, almost a unreasonable amount) but it does add to the grungy feel this movie has. This movie isn't for anyone that gets uncomfortable quick, there are gruesome and cruel scenes.The stories.. I felt only two of them really did something for me. The one with the couple at the motel, but terrible ending.. and the final haunted house story, which I found creative and disturbing at times. Though also suffered from making no real sense in the end.Also, it did drag, the runtime if much too long for these type of shallow stories. If they cut 2 stories (preferable the mediocre ones) it would've been a much better experience.It isn't a very good movie, just a bunch of shallow scary shorts that are hit or miss. But it has its moments; 5/10.",V-H-S
82,LanceBrave,"All about using the technology in versatile, clever ways",8,11 November 2013,"The most buzzed about horror indie of 2012 is extremely good. I don't know if we need more found-footage films after this. The movie is all about using the technology in versatile, clever ways. I love horror anthologies anyway. The format means the filmmakers have to cut all the fat and, if there's a weak segment, another is just around the corner. You get multiple movies for your dollar. Each of the six segments has a different approach to the genre.Adam Wingard's wrap-around isn't bad. It makes good use of Hitchcock's ""bomb under the table"" style of suspense. The characters are annoying but it builds to a satisfying ending. Good use of shadows and lighting. I haven't seen ""A Horrible Way to Die"" and am now interested.The first short proper, ""Amateur Night"" revolves around a group of amateur pornographers. It's a great starter. The characters aren't great and it should have been immediately obvious to the boys something wasn't right with the girl they picked up. (I suppose they weren't thinking with their big heads.) Once this one gets going, it really goes. The suspense in the latter half is fantastic and it makes excellent use of the first-person perspective. I liked David Bruckner's last film, ""The Signal,"" a lot so it's good to see him up to stuff again.Ti West's segment is actually the weakest. ""Second Honeymoon"" has got a twist that makes very little sense and ends abruptly afterwards. Even then, it does have one fantastic moment, even if that moment is just recycled from a famous urban legend. And you're never sure were its going. The lead actress is good.My favorite segment is Glenn McQuaid's ""Tuesday the 17th."" It's an extremely clever variation on the slasher concept and uses the video format especially well. The killer isn't quite like anything else I've seen before. The gore is startling and vicious. It's the tightest paced of the segments. That McQuaid made a film playing with the conventions of the genre probably shouldn't be surprising considering his last film was the extended Hammer homage, ""I Sell the Dead."" The verbosely entitled fourth bit, ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Young"" is my second favorite. It's the creepiest. The webcam format successfully disorients the audience. The characters are very likable and Helen Rogers gives the best performance in the film. The story keeps you guessing. You don't know if it's a ghost story or a psychological horror tale and winds up being neither.The much hyped final segment, ""10/31/98,"" is admittedly good. Special effects are managed very well, even if the repeated trick of people falling upwards is overdone. It does take its time building up the scares and there are some effective, subtle moments in the early-going. I also love hands exploding out of walls, which there's lots of. I'm not familiar with Radio Silence's Youtube shorts, which is what got them the job here, so I'll have to check those out.All the shorts avoid the pitfalls of the genre. Really, only once did I ever think ""Put the friggin' camera down!"" I'm very susceptible to shaky-cam and I wasn't bothered this. It also would have been nice if they could have roped Larry Fessenden, the producer, into doing a short. All those scan lines made me nostalgic for VHS in general. Is it the best horror film of the year? It's a bit early to tell but as of now, I'd say so. It's certainly the scariest film of the year so far.",V-H-S
83,Tehmeh,"Fine, creative effort.",7,22 August 2013,"""V/H/S"" disguises itself well. It's basically a collection of short horror movies that have nothing to do with each other, but it covers it up pretty well with the found footage - plot that's running in the background.I nearly gave up after 10 minutes, thinking my eyes/brain can't take this. Luckily I endured and was pretty amazed. The first segment surprised me, out of the blue I was watching something different and captivating. There are five (or six, depends how you look at it) different segments, and they all have their strengths. My favorites were 1, 4 and 5. Absolutely loved them. Then again ""love"" isn't the right word, I was just disturbed and fascinated.There's a high level of creativity involved. Some characters, some scares, some simple story lines, some twists are really good. The first 10 minutes lowered my expectations to almost zero, it felt so cheap and mindless. Damn you movie, you tricked me. The contrast was weird for me: I was watching a blu-ray about guys with shitty video cameras who watch shitty VHS tapes. And then, when something really creative happens and it's done really well, it creates a certain disturbing mood that works.Don't let the ""found footage""-thing bring you down if it isn't your thing. ""V/H/S"" dodges a certain bullet that some of the films of this genre have to swallow: when there's not enough material, not enough story, there'll often be too much pointless, forced discussion and unnecessary prolonging. With ""V/H/S"" and its short stories you get well done basics, you get the core elements and just enough of character development (when needed, as in segment 4) to help you invest yourself. I also think there's at least one segment for everyone to like.Acting is surprisingly good. I would like to compliment especially the female cast: Hannah Fierman (you'll see), Sophia Takal and Helen Rogers all give very good performances. There's nudity in this film, but it doesn't feel (always) forced or cheap. Here, showing your tits isn't the equivalent of ""I can't act, so how about these?"", no. I was impressed, the little hipster puritan within me isn't that angry at all. Well made horror compilation that doesn't feel like ""just a horror compilation"".

These guys just run around vandalising things and they attack girls and try to pull their tops off and they do all of this for fun?. Wow these guy's are Scumbags and we're supposed to like these guys?.I don't care what happens to them.I should also mention I don't care if the characters are (supposed) to be Assholes I don't care if that's what the (POINT) was I Don't Like It End of story.I would actually like some Likable characters in my movie so I care about what happens to them and this movie has none so as a result there is No suspense. This movie really bored me to tears and I even feel bored writing about it.A group of guys goes to this cabin and finds a bunch of VHS tapes in there,there is a dead body in a chair and for some reason they decide to stay there and watch tapes?. Why would anyone in their right minds want to watch a bunch of tapes with a dead man in the same room as them?. Here's an idea Morons take the tapes home and watch them there. I guess they didn't think of that?. But whatever that's just a nitpick. Shame on me for wanting some common sense in my movie, but whatever let's move on. The first story is (amateur night) and I must say the stupidity in this story blew my brain cells. A bunch of guys go out and get drunk and party and pick up girls,At the club they meet this weird girl who just stares and never blinks and always says I like you repeatedly like a robot and these guys can't tell there's something wrong with her. It was so obvious she was not normal and I figured it out right away but it took these guys all night to figure it out until it was too late. SPOILER ALERT! The girl is actually a winged creature who likes to kill boys.what a lame twist a group of boys end up dying out of their own stupidity. One guy even tried to run away and he must have tripped on the AIR because there was nothing for him to fall on yet for some reason he falls over and cuts himself.I'm guessing people who like this film will just say that's a nitpick so once again let's move on. Story two was the worst one it was called (second honeymoon) it's about a married couple and I have to say this is the most BORING couple I have seen in my entire life,they are so Boring they made me want to fall asleep,there idea of fun is filming themselves pumping gas into their car?. I have a question Why?.On second thoughts I don't care the answer will bore me too. The couple does not know how to have fun and they sound like robots and they like to go for walks around the grand canyon,I'm guessing that's their idea of fun but I'm nitpicking again shame on me. There is a dumb scene in the movie where someone sneaks around in their motel room when they are sleeping and they steal some money.Oh my God that's so SCARY and then the person puts a toothbrush in a toilet! Wow THAT'S SO HORRIFYING!. I'm being sarcastic. I guess I should get to the Lame twist.The wife has a secret lover and they are both lesbian killers. Like I give a Crap I was too bored and sleepy to care.Story 3 was about a group of friends that go away to the woods together which is a typical slasher movie setup. When they reach the woods one of the girls says to her friends your all going to Fu**ing Die out here,and what is the boys response Huh? What?. That was his response! Is he DUMB? The girl basically just threatened all of you and that's all he says? And then he forgets about it and he waits till later to bring it back up. If that was me I would have grabbed her by the neck and yelled at her WTF did you just say to Me!. But no these characters are too dumb to realise this girl wants them dead.To sum things up this is a story about a Bitch and the story Sucked. The forth story I did not like either it was about a girl who was hearing weird noises in her flat and she thought her flat was haunted,this story was BORING but I thought the acting from the girl was good but the ending was confusing.The last story was about a group of friends that go out on Halloween,they are supposed to be going to a party and they arrive at a dark house they walk inside and the place is empty,no one is there so it's OBVIOUS they are at the wrong house but they decide to stay there anyway??.Supernatural things start to happen in the house and they all die out of their own stupidity. There are some good effects but that's it,the story still sucks and the characters suck and the ending sucks even the Wrap around ending sucks. This was an Awful Film And I had a splitting headache when it was over Do not watch it.",V-H-S
86,Michael-Hallows-Eve,Great anthology and the best horror I've seen in a while (and I've seen plenty of movies)! See it!,10,8 August 2012,"This is one of the best anthologies I've seen in years! It's all filmed 'Found-Footage' style and is directed by different people, including Ti West, Adam Wingard, Joe Swanberg and more. It has six stories that involve almost all types of horror like ghosts, slashers, alien, creature and demons. Each part of the story has it's own appeal and I was in to it from go to whoa. It was bloody, it was scary, it was intriguing, it was intense. It was shocking in some parts and disgusting in others. The stories are ""Tape 56"" , ""Amateur Night"" , ""Second Honeymoon"" , ""Tuesday the 17th"" , ""The Strange Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Young"" & ""10-31-98"". I couldn't get enough of this movie, it was great. I'm giving it my highest rating so far of 10 out of 10! See it!",V-H-S
87,80sHorror,"If you like 2 hours of shaking camera, and no plot",10,7 August 2012,"We've reached the point where there are so many ""found-footage"" horror films that we have to cram several of them into one package to avoid glutting the marketplace. The result, ""V/H/S,"" includes six segments by nine directors, and like most anthologies it's a mixed bag. But the nice thing about anthologies is that if one of the stories isn't very good, you only have to wait a few minutes before another one starts.This movie did noting to me!! what did i watch? Don't get me wrong, some of the short stories were a bit frightening, but personally I don't like movies that are filmed like this. Also, some of the characters were VERY annoying. At a certain point, I really wanted some of them to die, because of the bad acting.",V-H-S
88,evilnigga,Very Horrible Stuff,4,31 October 2021,"This movie has some serious pacing issue. The first segment is somewhat entertaining and it just went downhill from there.

90,thelastblogontheleft,Close but not quite,5,26 October 2017,"V/H/S, created by Brad Miska and the horror website Bloody Disgusting, features a series of five horror shorts tied together by a sixth wraparound short that ties them all together. It features different directors for each segment, (five individual directors and one directing team) which makes for an interesting bit of diversity throughout the film.** SPOILERS! **It's no secret that I love the found footage niche of the horror genre. I'm also a big fan of anthologies, at least in theory (Creepshow delivered while The ABCs of Death, well, didn't), so I thought this would be a home run. It was a great idea, and I think it was decently done, but the shorts varied a bit too much in quality (I only liked two of the six), while the wraparound itself was mediocre.Tape 56 — the short that it continually returns to — was directed by Adam Wingard (You're Next, Blair Witch). It's a decently interesting story to tie the shorts together but just didn't do much for me.Amateur Night, directed by David Bruckner (The Signal), was a bit too obnoxious for me to enjoy. I know the story centers around three seeming frat boys out for a night of partying (and amateur porn making), but the drunken WOOing and cackling gets old really quick. It makes it pretty satisfying when Lily — the mysterious, wide-eyed woman they bring back to the hotel — literally rips off the incessant laugher's genitals. While they did a decent job making her a bit terrifying — I actually liked when she shows her face sort of split in the middle — the only real highlight for me was when she carried Clint off into the night with her talons dug into him, which was oddly convincing.Second Honeymoon, directed by Ti West (The Innkeepers, The Sacrament), was maybe my favorite of the bunch. They were the most natural actors and the premise, while not wild or supernatural, was pretty great. Also, after watching Sam try to convince Stephanie — repeatedly and uncomfortably — to take her clothes off while on camera, I was pretty happy when he was killed off. The gurgling and struggling to breathe was surprisingly convincing, and it was a nice twist to have Stephanie run off with a woman.Tuesday the 17th, directed by Glenn McQuaid, was one of the weakest, in my opinion. It went with the overplayed storyline of 20-somethings deep in the woods and, while the killer being unable to be captured on video was mildly interesting, the weak acting ruined it for me.The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger, directed by Joe Swanberg (who actually starred in Second Honeymoon), had a decently interesting premise, but was somewhat painful to watch. It was neat to go into it thinking that it was your typical haunted house situation but then find out it went deeper into aliens- using-her-as-an-incubator territory. But still it relied too much on cheap jump scares than anything else.10/31/98, directed by Radio Silence (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett, Justin Martinez, and Chad Villella, who also all — aside from Justin — acted in the film), was my second favorite. I thought it could have been overplayed to have the story take place on Halloween but it felt fun, especially since so many creepy moments got laughed off due to their belief that they were in an elaborate, but fake, haunted house. When they realize what is going on — or at least that it isn't staged after all — the special effects come on a bit too heavy-handed (though, no pun intended, I thought the hands coming out of the walls was particularly creepy). It uses some of the classic White Lady folklore with the girl leading them by car to the train tracks and then abandoning them right before their death. Maybe not the most brilliant short film to ever exist but I liked it.A bit disjointed overall and, again, the quality seems to jump around quite a bit. I wish the stories relied more on writing and acting than jump scares and camera glitches, but it's worth a watch.",V-H-S

Each of the tapes has some nudity - lots of gore and some good surprises - of course a lot of people die - nothing new here.But the filmmakers put a lot of effort into this & I was entertained. The highlight was the Skype scenes which played out an interesting and strange premise - not fully explained, but the technique of filming the couples' conversations - especially when she was being ""haunted"" was cool.Low point were the (amateurish) arms sticking out thru holes in the walls - very weak - reminded me of a cheap home made haunted house.

94,thewillt08,Is This Gimmick Dead Yet?,4,7 July 2013,"Horror is a tricky genre for many reasons. If you want the best experience you watch a horror movie you watch it at one in the morning, all the lights off, alone, or with friends who won't ruin the experience. V/H/S/ is another found footage film that proves once again to be over used and boring. These movies are cheap but can be affective if used properly. After Paranormal Activity many movies tried to copy it and, well, this was a good try.The basic story to V/H/S/ is a group of thieves who are looking for a rare VHS tape in some house. They find these weird tapes showing murders of every kind. This is the big problem. There are a lot of characters in the movie and little to no time to get to know them and when they die the audience feels nothing. The shaky camera is annoying and the editing is impressive to make it look like a VHS tape but if anybody thinks this is real then there is a problem. There are five individual tapes showing five different paranormal events.The first tape is really weird and predictable but at the same time incredibly disturbing. A small group of young adults go out to a bar and are trying to get a few girls. Naturally, one of them brings his camera. The major problem with this is the un-believability but I can put myself in the mindset that this isn't real and I hoped I could enjoy it. They go to the bar, get drunk, and meet their girls. From that point the end result is obvious but I did not expect the gore and disturbing images that were to follow. It wasn't scary at all but it was really hard to watch and touché to the movie for surprising me for thirty seconds for the last moments of the tape. After each tape ends it goes back to the house with the thieves for a short while and then goes on to the next tape. The second tape was really good. It was suspenseful and creepy. It follows a young couple traveling the country with their camera to capture the memories. The couple's romance was believable and I did feel sympathy for the characters. This situation was very believable and is something I can see happening. That film hits the real focus of a scare with no jump scares and its terror that is really scary. This tape had my full attention and I was afraid to blink but towards the end it died down, pun intended, and almost took away the experience.The third tape follows a group of four young adults who travel up in the mountains to go camping or whatever. It turns out a Predator like invisible monster ends up attacking them and there is a slight twist that is again predictable. I can see this being entertaining to some people but to most this is a cheap knockoff of an amazing movie. Seeing the static in the screen on the shape of a man was stupid. The fact that it couldn't be seen on camera was silly and the deaths were boring and unsatisfying. Again I will give the tape credit for the last minute or so but it wasn't scary but it was gross and disturbing to say the least.The fourth tape follows a couple separated but they connect via Skype or a face to face chat room. This one was cool and I was interested to see what would happen at the end. The end was very clever and I thought it was well written but it lacked in scare. This would have been a good film if it stood on its own. The characters could have been built up and the twist at the end could have meant so much more. Instead we get a bunch of short films strung together into this mess.The final film had really good cinematography but that was about it. It was Halloween in 1998 and the film looked like it was from 1998. That was really cool as the house they go to for as party eventually turns into a fun house. The special effects were cool and the exorcism in the attic was creepy and unexpected the ending was something I enjoyed but it was the end of the movie. The only reason I stuck around and sat through all the clips was to see the endgame of the thieves in the house. We don't really get that. Overall this movie was missing a lot of pieces. The plot makes little to no sense, the characters were boring and there were too many of them. The scare was lacking, except for one ray of thrill. The movie started off with a lot of blood and disturbing images and put a bad taste in my mouth but at least I was interested to see where it was going. As a horror movie this fails and as a movie it was disappointing. V/H/S is a movie you have seen before with the found footage gimmick. This needs to die and the horror genre needs to reinvent itself. A good horror movie needs to be effective to be good. A good horror movie keeps me up at night and scared to go to bed. A good horror movie makes you think about it after it ends an this movie doesn't do that. It is very forgettable and even writing this the next day after watching it I had to think hard about what I saw. V/H/S is very forgettable so it gets the WillyT A for Effort.",V-H-S

Don't get me wrong I have enjoyed a lot of films in this horror sub genre even recently with Chernobyl Diaries, Home Movie, The Tunnel and of course the REC films but this was painful. Even the copious amounts of nudity couldn't save this film. For one of the first times in horror movie review history I agreed with Roger Ebert on his hatred for a horror film. This film is so disjointed, boring and meandering to the point that I just couldn't care less what was going on and which story was which etc etc. If you only have seen this film in the horror genre lately....please don't judge our industry on this because horror is fantastic these days ( especially from overseas ) go and seek out Lovely Molly, Enter nowhere, Innkeepers, The loved ones and Excision because that what horror is all about.

96,SmileyMcGrouchpants,Great!,9,5 April 2020,"It may seem weird to compare this film to works as disparate as ""All These Sleepless Nights,"" Adam Gnade's ""Caveworld,"" and ""Donnie Darko,"" but the overriding theme of youth activity percolates and saves the day -- makes it more than just a usual horror movie, but also a horror movie that has more bite. Apart from a bit in the opening segment that is a bit unpleasant, it's remarkable how much of this has to do with male/female comeuppance and the reversal of relations -- often humorously so, if you're around to get the joke! Further, it seems to solve that problem confronting both mumblecore and recent horror by having them around for 20 min. so you can just know them off -- you can cram an awful lot of detail and observation in there (witness the ""Spider"" character in the woods sequence -- how many of us have known someone like him, and how often is he to show up in most feature films?), without milling about and losing people's patience, or suffering the irony of not wanting to see them go when they have to do (i.e., such errors as in David Gordon Green's recent ""Halloween"" remake: when the little black kid swears, everyone in the audience laughs, because it's cute, but he's about to be knocked off, like a lot of other characters in the movie, so why develop sympathy for him?). Sophie Takal, as always, is a cute nice presence, and you see the sort of things Gen X'ers would put in their zines, no less than the filmmakers of ""The Blair Witch Project"" incorporated into their movie, too (no less than the '70s guy, Hooper, included in ""Jaws,"" which is reflective of the times -- aren't we supposed to put plenty of things in our movies that are for our own pleasure?) -- the joy of going out on the road and checking out simple, corny things for yourself, like postcards and vacation spots. I think it's selling this movie short to say it's ""pretty good for an anthology"" or even ""really good for anthology!"" -- there's a lot going on here, simply because the filmmakers took the time and energy to pack it in (and, yes, some of it reminds me of the reminiscing the characters in Richard Fariña's ""Been Down So Long, It Looks Like Up to Me"" do -- every generation thinks it's the first to scamper around!). View it for this reason, even as a second time, and it holds up remarkably well. Kudos!",V-H-S
97,jaguiar313,Disappointing and over-hyped found footage horror,5,5 December 2012,"Horror anthology has five different segments directed by 5 different directors all presented in the found footage format. The framing segment tells the tale of a group of ill fated punks who are hired to break into a house and steal a VHS tape. When they get there the owner appears dead and there are tapes strewn about so, they begin to view them to try to figure out which is the one they need. Each tape then contains footage of a different tale of terror. The premise sounds fun but, sadly, none of the stories are particularly scary or gripping. The first three segments are just routine and dull (sadly, including one by Ti West) and while there are some spooky bits in the last two stories, neither really pulls it together to create a solid tale. The second to last ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"", starts out spooky as a haunted young woman reaches out to her boyfriend on Scype but, comes to a confusing conclusion. And the final tale ""10/31/98"" about a group of Halloween party goers who enter the wrong house, also starts out spooky and just gets silly with an ending the reminds one of ""The Devil Inside"". There is some nice gore and some interesting low budget effects but, ultimately it's just a big disappointment.",V-H-S
98,azeemnavarro,A weak start for the franchise,2,19 January 2020,"Watching an anthology movie is like playing the russian roulete: you can get killed (watch a terrible piece of trash) or you get to survive (watch something thats actually worth your time). Mostly, you shoot yourself in the head with this kind of movies, and unfortunately this first installment on the v/h/s franchise is no exception.
That's such a shame because out of the 6 shorts (if we count the tape 56 one, because it only serves as the frame narrative), only 2 are worth it. Those two are the first (Amateur Night) and the last (10/31/98), as they are entertaining, clever and actually use the found footage technique in a meaningful way.
It's such a shame that the other ones suck so badly, none of them are worth checking out. You may say some try to do some interesting stuff, but man, why would I care if everything else is so poorly constructed?

100,nomorefog,"A Lot of Investment, But the Payback Isnt Hefty",6,6 February 2021,"Released in 2012, VHS is what I would call the penultimate of found footage horror. Since the genre was kickstarted by the Blair Witch Project some time before, we are looking as of 2021, a 20 year timeframe of the genre, that is, movies made for a generation who no longer go to the movies any longer.
I bought VHS on spec on ebay for the princely sum of five bucks because I do like the genre I have to say. After a hiatus of 80s B horror movies and brainless blockbuster sci-fi, found footage became for me a shot in the arm that gave hope the horror genre had not yet died the death from a dearth of ideas and no finance. The movies that first got me in were on You Tube, and some were exceptionally good, like Rorschach, Remnants, Evidence, and The Ghost Footage parts 1 and 2 just to name a few.
So, I bought a player and collected some discs, some good, others not so much. What I think about VHS is that maybe it tries a little bit too hard. It takes a lot of concentration to make sense of all of the content. Maybe thats the point and I come from a different generation. It is an anthology, but like a great anthlogy film like Dead of Night it has a larger story that is meant to somehow connect the others. These smaller stories vary wildly in quality of writing and directing. Unfortunately, the technical aspects that define found footage like the shaky camera, blurred vision, overlapping images and other tricks to disorient the viewer become a bit too much. The effects detract from the disturbing storyline, they are overdone and get in the way.
So, I found myself watching VHS twice to figure out what I really thought of it. If you like all the effects I just mentioned you will love this movie more than I did, you won't think like me that they're overdone. The jumpscares are phoned in with a few exceptions and what the viewer has left is a lot of exposition that really doesn't explain much at all.
Having said that, VHS is still unbearably creepy. The suspense if you could call it that makes your head swim, with all kinds of explanations that may or may not, define what you are actually seeing. So in that respect, its worth your time, but do not ruminate over it too much, its just a horror film.",V-H-S
101,samgiannn,Crazy and Usually Very Scary,6,30 October 2014,"I thought every segment was excellent, and they were all unique and insane in their own way. The first segment, Amateur Night, was just bats*** crazy, and it really set up a good tone for the movie. The second segment, Second Honeymoon, tones it down, but I thought this one was the most disturbing. It's the only one without the supernatural in it. This segment felt like a snuff film, which makes it more disturbing. The third segment, Tuesday the 17th, ratchets it up again with a sort of supernatural slasher. This segment is my personal favorite. The fourth segment, The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger, was the scariest segment. This one was presented through a Skype conversation, and it really reminded me of one of those ""REAL GHOST CAUGHT ON TAPE!!!"" videos. The final segment, 10/31/98, was the flashiest and the most fun; however, I felt this was the weakest segment. There was too much going on so that the audience doesn't really know what to be scared of. The frame narrative was also very creepy too because some stuff would move around in the background that you don't really catch on the first viewing.",V-H-S
102,eytand94,V/H/S: A Hit and a Miss,7,5 January 2013,"A found footage anthology horror film. Sounds intriguing, right? The actual ""found footage"" idea has become horror's biggest gimmick, resulting in a tired and at times silly payoff. But it has been a while since we saw as good a horror anthology as George Romero's ""Creepshow."" ""V/H/S"" combines the two concepts in order to squeeze out one more effective found footage movie, and the results are rather mixed. The best way to review the movie is to dissect each tale one by one.The first segment that is intertwined with all of the other stories is Adam Wingard's ""Tape 56."" A group of despicable criminals who get off on filming their exposing the breasts of local women are sent off on a new job: to break into a house in the middle of nowhere and steal a VHS tape. When they do enter the home, they find a corpse and videotapes scattered across the floor with several video monitors. While the rest of the criminals explore the home, one stays in the room with the dead man and sets a goal: to watch one VHS tape after another and figure out which one the gang is supposed to steal. Therefore, the setup is presented. The problem with this segment is the characters. They are completely unlikable people. Who cares if they live or die? I certainly don't. But one thing ""Tape 56"" has going for it is mood. An old, dark house is a good, old-fashioned atmosphere for a horror film, and Wingard uses that to his advantage.The anthology truly begins with David Bruckner's ""Amateur Night."" Two horny college boys hook their friend up with a pair of spyglasses that film their every move. Their intent is to go out for a night on the town, pick up some girls, and film their sexual encounters in their motel room. The bad news for them is they pick up the wrong girl. This is personally my favorite story in the film. It's scary and gory in equal parts, with a brief touch of comedy hidden inside. The crucial point in ""Amateur Night"" is in the casting of the girl, and Hannah Fierman gains points as one of the creepiest looking women I have ever seen. When she stares at you with those large, strange eyes, you easily get freaked out. The story ends on a good note, and sets the ball rolling.Up next, we have Ti West's ""Second Honeymoon"" in which a couple head out on a road trip for a few nights in celebration of their marriage. They get a hotel room, and one night, they receive a knock on the door from a girl asking for a ride. The events in the next few nights determine the gruesome fate of the couple. West is one of my favorite names in the horror genre, having released the amazing ""The House of the Devil"" and the equally fun ""The Innkeepers."" West is known for slow-burn terror, and he sticks to the formula here. It is even a little bit creepy at times. However, we have seen this all before, and the ending leaves you with more questions than answers. Decent, but slightly disappointing.Luckily, ""Second Honeymoon"" isn't the worst segment. That title goes to Glenn McQuaid's 80's slasher riff ""Tuesday the 17th."" A group of standardly stupid teenagers go to a lake for a day, and are killed off one by one. None of these characters are sympathetic, and what's worse is they are all so obviously acting. They don't get any help from the implausible and badly delivered dialogue, and the gore effects here are truly sophomoric.Joe Swanberg, on the other hand, manages to pack a fairly good segment titled ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger."" For the first time, the found footage subgenre introduces a rather original method: a Skype conversation. A young woman has conversations with her long-distance boyfriend, and while her arm is growing harsher in injury, she comes to a conclusion that her new apartment is haunted. Her boyfriend doesn't really believe her, so she asks him to record her nightly encounters as proof. Swanberg pulls a few awesome scares out of his tale, and Helen Rogers is an attractive and likable heroine.The last story is presented by newcomers Radio Silence and it is called ""10/31/98."" A few college guys go out for a Halloween party, and so obviously wind up in the wrong house. Their drunken escapades around the home are instantly shattered when they go upstairs. Great effects and funhouse scares make this one a very decent entry.I, for one, am growing very tired of found footage. Too many films have been made since the success of ""Paranormal Activity,"" and despite ""V/H/S""'s interesting concept, the movie is not much different from its predecessors. But since the majority of the stories shown here are quite entertaining and scary, I can forgive its flaws. Is it a movie that will forever play on the nightmarish recesses of the mind? Absolutely not. Is it a nifty contribution to the horror genre? It certainly is.",V-H-S
103,Sorpse,creepy,7,27 January 2013,"i'll start off by saying that i was definitely a fan of this movie. Its an anthology so you'll obviously like some of the stories more than others. The only two that were actually memorable for me were the ones with the creepy girl and the skype one. Both seemed quite original and unpredictable. For people not knowing what they are getting themselves into, this movie is violent, horrific, gory, and explicit...verbally and sexually. In fact its probably not the best movie for a date night, even if your looking to scare your date into your arms. The reason for this is all the nudity. I believe every short film has its share of nudity, even the whole wrap around story. Now nudity is never a bad thing but because of the Point-of-view shot on video style it makes the viewer (in my opinion) feel like a creep, like you are watching video of real people. This makes it awkward to watch with the ol lady, on the other hand though this must be taken as a credit for the makers of the film because it shows that they took advantage of that particular style of filming and makes the viewer feel uneasy. Good work. One negative that i felt was the wrap around story. Reading the synopsis you know that its about some hooligans who are sent to collect a video and find a bunch so they have to watch them all to see which is the one they are looking for. If i did not read that before watching this movie then i would not have got it. It just seems like a bunch of guys up to no good, startin trouble in the neighbourhood, and then one of them sits down and watches a video tape he found...maybe after multiple viewings i would notice more details but after one watch im not sure why/where or how they came across these videos. No matter though, its the short stories we came for and they deliver. The only other negative would be that all these short films are supposed to be on VHS yet in one story the guy is filming it from a little camera in his glasses and another is shot on skype....so why would this be on VHS then? Fortunatly for me the good outweighed the bad by far and i had a great time watching this movie that managed to be much more creepier or ""scarier"" than the majority of horror films.",V-H-S

Almost everything written about V/H/S – the good, the bad and the ugly – is written. So, here may be a unique comment. No, I haven't read every review, but I'm still going forward. Hannah Fierman, who plays Lily, may have bigger eyes then Barbara Steele, ""The Queen of All Scream Queens."" Steele's most famous appearance is in the Mario Bava Italian Gothic film classic ""Black Sunday."" Also, is there a count of the number of times the F-word is in V/H/S? A record may be broken!! I wonder if George Romero saw this film? If he did, I'd bet he'd like it.",V-H-S
105,ToxicJug,Decent Found Footage Horror,6,6 October 2021,"V/H/S is a mixed bag for me making it Incredibly difficult to review.. Where the film has many low points, it also has many high points. While the film makes some bad writing decisions as far as its characters go and also struggles with pacing throughout, to say that it is a bad film wouldn't be fair. V/H/S isn't a film for everyone to enjoy, however if your looking for a decent anthology style, found footage, horror film this is a great option. While I feel that the first ""tape"" that we see in the film somewhat overshadows the rest, the film maintains that very ""realistic"" feel that makes found footage horror so great!",V-H-S
106,sharkattack1978,VHS is no video drome but it will mess with your head!,5,21 February 2013,"O.K. before I start, this film should contain a warning label saying that anyone who suffers from motion sickness, should either take travel pills before watching this or should just avoid it completely. The camera is literally all over the place and before even the end (say about 30 minutes through) I did have to reach for the sick bucket. Not for the content which i must admit for an 18 was lacking but because the camera made me dizzy and nauseous. VHS is supposed to be one of those found footage homages to great anthologies like Creepshow, tales from the Crypt, trick 'r' treat and those other great movies that had three to five stories in one film. VHS has a good concept, it's simple and sometimes effective, but the rest of the movie is annoying and doesn't make any sense whatsoever. The film is compiled by some great independent directors like TI West who brought us the chilling House of the Devil but he also brought us the awful Cabin Fever 2. His story in this is perplexing but I'll get to that later.The films opens with some guys wrecking things, playing pranks and molesting some poor woman in a car park by lifting her top and showing her breasts. Tehn the action switches to a car and the story that is explained on the cover takes flight. Their mission is to retrieve a VHS videotape from some old guys home. Seems straightforward right? WRONG! when they get there they find a dead body in front of some TV sets and a load of VHS tapes. One poor unfortunate member of the group must subject himself to the horror on the tapes.Warning!!! the following does contain spoilers....and there's a reason that I put these as it warns you what you are letting yourself in for. This movie has stories that have no end, only two end satisfactory and that's Amateur Night and 10/31/98. The rest will leave you scratching your head and saying ""is that it?"" If i had known that this was what the movie was about, I might have liked it more. Hence that said I will be watching VHS2, but at least I will go into it knowing what to expect.The first story of the bunch is Amateur Night. This one was actually fairly scary. It's a simple story of Lads going out of a night and pulling women to come back and have sex with them. The whole story is told from the perspective of a nerd like character who has a camera in his glasses but they get much more than they bargained for when the woman turns out to be a blood thirsty monster who has a crush on guy with glasses. Needless to say a bloodbath ensues and he runs for his life. The monster thinking that he doesn't like her and terrorises him until she picks him up and drops him from a very high height. this film contains what feels like skipping so if you are watching this on DVD or Bluray and thinks something is wrong with the DVD/bluray, DON'T, it is part of the film. It was made this way.The second story SECOND HONEYMOON is a perplexing tale about a newlywed couple checking into a hotel and when they go to sleep, some mysterious girl is filming them with their video camera. The first night, they are just watched and filmed, the second night, the woman use a switchblade knife on the woman's buttocks. Then the third the man is brutally stabbed in the throat. The Wife of the poor guy asked the woman if she deleted the murder and the film ends. Not a very satisfying end, it's the ""is that it"" end I was talking about.The third is definitely the ridiculous of them all. TUESDAY THE 17TH. Just a rip off of Friday the 13th with a pixelated man who is murdering some really stupid people. enough said! The fourth one STRANGE THING HAPPENED TO EMILY, is actually a good story but a perplexing end. It starts with a girl showing herself topless on a webcam to some guy who says he is some kind of doctor. The girl becomes friends with the guy and then she gets plagued by ghostly going ons (paranormal Activity 4 anyone?) She sees these things and falls unconscious, in which he comes round and pulls something out of her back. (WTF!?) It ends with the guy finding another girl/woman who shows him herself topless. Plot holes is how the hell he got there in the first place when he was talking to her via his home?????? The fifth story begins after the poor guy watching these tapes finds out that the man ain't dead and of course he meets a grisly end. The fifth story 10/31/98 is a halloween party gone majorly wrong. a bunch of guys go round to a house expecting a party and they get much more than they bargained for when it turns out that a cult are trying to sacrifice a girl and rid themselves of a demon. Like other modern horror clichés the girl turns out to be possessed and while trying to save her, she imprisons them in a car which is then hit by a speeding train.That in a nutshell is what you can expect to see in this movie. If my explanation has helped and you still want to watch this knowing what to expect and be prepared for it, then all i say it just don't expect too much and you may enjoy it. This movie definitely has the WTF? ratio to it and hopefully my explanation has helped with the abrupt endings that you experience in this movie. VHS is a good idea but not fully used to it's potential.",V-H-S
107,JamesMitchell451,A welcome experiment in horror,6,21 September 2013,"Horror anthologies are my favorite sub genre in film. I just love the well done ones cause they are able to tie together several different stories together, and I don't know why but I just find that so intriguing. The fact that it just screams different to me is probably the main reason I am in love with this sub genre. V/H/S is a horror anthology tied together not only by a main story, but also by the format the stories are presented in: That good ole' fashioned format from the era of the dinosaurs called VHS. In other words, each of these stories are presented in the found-footage format. Sounds like a recipe for awesome right? And it sometimes is... it works a lot of the time but it also doesn't work in some spots and that makes it feel a bit uneven, the film falls into the classic category of good but not great. The main storyline is that a group of assholes that go around doing just awful stuff: We are talking rape, murder, break ins, and they film all of their crimes. They get offered a job by a mysterious party, they are to break into an old man's house and steal a VHS tape. So they arrive at the house and find the old man dead in front of several TVs and a bunch of VHS tapes. So these fools start watching these tapes, and whenever they pop a tape in the film cuts to whatever is on the tape. It is a truly intriguing premise. Each of these horror segments are directed by different people. The stories that are on the tapes are the tale of a couple on a honeymoon being stalked by an unknown person, a bunch of kids bringing a girl to a motel room for sex and discover she is not what she seems, foolish friends that accidentally interrupt an exorcism, a girl seeking revenge against something clearly not human, and finally a woman who experiences mysterious things at night. The one with the honeymoon directed by Ti West is in my opinion the weakest, the two lovers are kind of annoying and the ending for it is just dumb. The segments with the motel room, the girl seeking revenge, and the girl who experiences weird crap are surprisingly the best ones, seeing how they are the best written, best acted, and overall best filmed segments. Personally, I think the segment with the girl with her own agenda against the entity in the woods is really the best, the sense of isolation coupled with the well timed scares and creepy atmosphere. The segment with the exorcism is a mixed bag. While it contained truly creepy imagery also featured asshole main characters and an ending that is just ""meh"". The reason for these guys interrupting the ritual in my opinion was just stupid and as for the dialogue: Sometimes good, sometimes awful. How is the main storyline about the break in? Well... mostly good. It also features some truly horrifying imagery, gripping suspense, and great timing. Despite the characters being assholes, you really want to know what happens to them and you really want to see them die. But the ending is a complete WTF. Overall, I applaud V/H/S, I am sick of routine horror films and I am especially sick of found footage films. However, V/H/S mostly succeeds due to the effective use of it's hand-held perspective, good acting, and well done video effects. I really wish that more horror movies would experiment like this, I view V/H/S as a good film but not as good as I wanted it to be.",V-H-S
108,czarnobog,Refreshes the Horror Genre - Bravo!,10,6 July 2013,"As a hardcore lifelong horror fan, I was thrilled to catch this little gem on my DVR.Forget that it's an anthology. It's a bit disjointed and free-form, but the stories are easy to follow, there's no crappy filler scenes or banal dialog, and the surprises keep piling up. It reinvents the made-on-video genre, blowing away Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity by being more experimental, sexier, scarier, more disturbing, with a greater range of special efx and ingenious use of video efx.It starts off with a deceptively simple interstitial story (as pitched in the log-line) which sets the expectations low. We get a hint that something more is about to happen with a slightly subtle reveal that foreshadows the hellish carnage to come.The cast is wonderful. The acting is blessedly naturalistic (meaning extremely realistic for those of you who never took an art class) but not flat. While the mostly young actors have the look of folks you'd usually find in university films, they perform brilliantly. And unlike well-known movie stars, their fresh faces help preserve the suspension of disbelief that makes horror films more effective.Hannah Fierman deserves a nod as a stand-out in a stand-out cast, but she's also aided by delightful make-up efx and mechanical efx work.Unlike most low budget films these days, the stories vary widely in tone and include some stunning location work. The screenplay is intelligent and the vignettes are original.The film was made by a collective, so I'm not even going to attempt to mention everyone by name. Suffice it to say, they are bona fide filmmakers who have mastered the medium and don't get overwhelmed by the cutting edge techniques they use.If you're a horror fan and haven't yet seen it, check it out. But be advised that this one is much more full-blooded (no pun intended) than the typical made-for-a-middle-road-audience flicks, with liberal injections of sex and nudity and realistic gore. Softcore horror fans might find it too disturbing.",V-H-S
109,PKazee,"Terrific collection of ""found footage"" horror!",8,30 July 2012,"Saw this at the Fantasia film festival and I hope to have an opportunity to see it with an audience again, as I'm not sure the film would be as effective if one were to watch it alone at home. In any case, V/H/S is a collection of short ""found footage"" horror films produced by Brad Miska, the man behind bloody-disgusting.com. It features the directing talents of several established Indy filmmakers including David Bruckner (THE SIGNAL), Ti West (THE INNKEEPERS), Glenn McQuaid (STAKE LAND), Adam Wingard (A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE), noted mumblecore actor/director Joe Swanburg, and the popular internet video collective known as Radio Silence (best known for the various CHAD, MATT & ROB INTERACTIVE ADVENTURE's). I enjoyed each and every segment, though the two the stand up the best to post-Experience scrutiny are probably Bruckner's (AMATEUR NIGHT) and Swanburg's (THE STRANGE THING THAT HAPPENED TO EMILY WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG). In AMATEUR NIGHT, a couple of guys give a pair of Spycam glasses to a friend and the three go out to have a wild night on the town. They end up bringing two young woman back to their apartment, one of whom seems extremely ""game"", while the other might as well actually BE game, in as much as she behaves like an excited, yet cautious animal, her eyes always bugged out, her head turning sharply and rapidly at every movement or sound, and rather than speak, she hisses in barely intelligible verbalized feral spurts. And sure enough, once her clothes come off, one discovers that there's much more to this gal than could ever have been imagined. As for STRANGE THING THAT HAPPENED TO EMILY, this one involves a series of (often stationary) Skype video conversations between a man and a women, the later convinced that a peculiar entity is inside her house, perhaps the ghost of a child with which she hopes to communicate while her boyfriend helplessly looks on through the laptop screen. Those who easily get queasy from constant ""swingcam"" footage, will be particularly pleased with the inclusion of this one.The other segments are: Second Honeymoon (Ti West) - A couple's vacation is compromised by a mysterious nocturnal intruder.Tuesday the 17th (Glenn McQuaid) - A young woman is not honest about her intentions when she brings her friends out to a secluded spot in the woods where several murders once occurred.10/31/98 (Radio Silence) - Friends set off for a party dressed up in lame Halloween costumes, but instead of arriving at their intended destination, they find themselves in a demoniacally haunted house at the absolute worst time possible.and the wraparound... Tape 56 (Adam Wingard) - Some guys are paid to break into a house and steal a video tape. When they get there they find a dead man and DOZENS of tapes. In order to find the tape they've been asked to steal, they begin watching the tapes one after another (the other 5 stories being what they find on those tapes).",V-H-S

The film's narrative frame is really quite rushed and unspecific, not drawing any attention to the main characters of the actual film and just silently killing each one off as the film narrows towards its conclusion. The short films that compromise the majority of the film are however extremely fun and its interesting how each one varies from the last. V/H/S cleverly starts and finishes with the strongest of the collection and leaves a mark on the mind, the first short film being particularly unsettling.",V-H-S
112,benegesserit20,Hm...,5,9 February 2014,"This review contains some spoiler, please don't read it before watching the movie.This movie was a quite controversial experience. It is built up by putting together a few completely different short horror stories in a found footage setting. It was a sort of a horror anthology and not a bad one. The horror quality of these stories varies, but most of them are quite decent and there are some really nasty and disturbing stuff there too.So, why didn't I give it a higher vote? Well, because while watching the stories one by one, I couldn't get rid of a massive ""what the hell is this whole thing about?"" feeling. The background story is really confusing, who are these guys, who hired them, who is the dead guy in that house, where did he get all these tapes from, I mean there must be a connection between these stories? But as it happens, there isn't. Or so I think. Quite the same goes for the mini individual stories.It would have worked far better as a sort of a mini-series or with a coherent background story.So, it was worth a watch, but it was quite disappointing. Whatever, I'll check out what V/H/S 2 has to offer.",V-H-S
113,pjr235,Watch it! This is the way horror is meant to be done!,9,9 June 2013,"Every single video was great. I'm 24 and I've been a horror movie fan since I was a kid. I gotta say VHS really hit home and completely blasts away trash like Paranormal Activity and these other big budget films. These movies nowadays work off the cheap spooks and overly loud audio to scare the audience. VHS, gives us pure horror and does it in a way that is familiar but also very alien, in that most of the shorter films aren't connected, but they all show some type of twisted and often paranormal self-shot video.(I can already tell I'm not doing this movie justice with my weak review.) Many people don't like it because how gritty and grizzly the horror can get. But I love the gore in horror flicks. You watch horror to be scared, spooked out, and to watch a given situation go really bad. If the neg reviewers want cheap scares, stick to paranormal activity. If you want trip after trip of one horror story after another, with good effects, good acting and great horror, watch this movie! I'm currently watching VHS2 and so far its fantastic! This (VHS) is the new and next big thing. VHS deserves to get a part 3, 4 and however many more they can come up with this kind of quality horror. The over-all story behind the tapes (like the people watching them) is also interesting and I really hope they can spin a good (long running) tale out of that as well. As for gripes: I can only say that I wish a few of them were a little longer, especially the first story with the winged demon girl. I wanted to know what happened to the guy after he was carried away. Oh! Wouldn't it be sick to get a part 2 of some of the stories from VHS1? I definitely want to see more of the forest static-man, I loved the effects on it. Those weren't really gripes, because all the short films had their own kind of magic. But again, it wouldn't be hard to imagine that the tapes or extended versions of them are scattered throughout the world (*wink, movie idea) and so VHS3 can have a few extended version or before/after versions of some of the stories. That might be trying to squeeze or milk too hard, but I know they can do it and I know I'd watch it. Also The dead guy on the chair (VHS1).. there were a ton of tapes, maybe there is more we haven't seen. Also, what was his story? Maybe they can do a few before and afters for the shorts on VHS1 using that big dead guy. Like, big guy got one half of those stories and those teens got the other half. (of course there would be a few new ones, they couldn't have magically and by chance watch pt2 or 1 of everything the big guy saw, but this would be an opportunity to squeeze in a few before/after versions of what we saw in VHS1.)",V-H-S

Some people do consider gore and splatter to be scary but thats just not what I feel horror is. The tone of this movie did feel like it was made by teenage boys considering how much it was excited by young womens body parts and gore.

I mean, I get it, it is all ""found footage"" but really, no camera had image stabilizer? really? And even if they didn't, can't anyone shoot a straight shot without constantly, and I mean constantly, zoom in and out and go left and right with the camera? It's just too much. It is so distracting that you actually can get dizzy with it, and the plot and subplots of the movie did not need any of it. It is a good movie without the need for this abomination of camera effects.Good movie. Good plots. But terrible camera work.

116,thefilmdiscussion,'V/H/S' brings found-footage terror to frightening new levels,9,4 September 2012,"Adam Wingard, Ti West, David Bruckner, Glenn McQuaid, Joe Swanberg, and the YouTube sensation Radio Silence have all come together to create ""V/H/S"", which simultaneously resurrects the anthology film with gusto, places itself among the scariest of scary movies, and makes the found footage genre more legit than it has ever been.Set in the narrative framework of a group of villainous hoodlums with a v/h/s camcorder, we follow them into a house during a ""job"" to steal a precious v/h/s tape for a mysterious third party. When they arrive, however, they are met with a dead body and stacks upon stacks of unlabeled v/h/s tapes. As they put the tapes into the player to discover which one they're supposed to grab, we watch in horror as the sick stories play out in front of us. We witness five v/h/s stories, each directed by a different master of modern horror, before the outside story begins to unravel into something as twisted as what's on the demented tapes.The stories range from a cautionary tale for predatory men, to a modern take on the ""trapped-in-the-woods"" slasher. We witness a second honeymoon gone horribly bad, an ingenious use of Skype, and a take on the haunted house genre that will not be bested for a long time. And I won't even tell you what happens in the house where the criminals are looking for the tape...This is terrifying filmmaking, original and ingeniously twisted. Watching the film feels like experiencing a living, breathing nightmare. Cold sweats, confusion, shock, nausea - it all comes with this territory.Combining the low-budget style of found footage with the low-budget look of shooting on v/h/s tape gives these filmmakers the opportunities to offer big scares, scares that don't give themselves up with CGI cheapness or flashy editing. No, ""V/H/S"" is down and dirty reality horror that digs so far under your skin it threatens to burst out the other side.The filmmakers wisely choose to leave many details out, dropping us into stories that have long-since hit the ground running, giving us only enough exposition-laced dialogue to let us form our own conclusions, and often the films are left partially unresolved. Exactly like you'd expect found footage to be. It's bold and risky, and some will find it confusing, but it couldn't be more perfect.If you're looking for something new to be scared of, pop in ""V/H/S"".This is what nightmares are made of.-Thomas Bond, TheFilmDiscussion.com",V-H-S

The stories are your usual scary stuff, from supernatural creatures to haunted house and one devoid of any horror elements, where a couple on a honeymoon is stalked by a killer. The scares aren't much, if you saw the trailer you know where to jump. And the first and last stories are pretty good but the rest, including the meta story about the tapes are really boring. You can give it a chance if paranormal activity really scared you but do not expect much. And one question will remain, how did the guy get his hands on these tapes, on VHS no less?

Makeup was nice.Negatives: Tape 56, Second Honeymoon and 10/31/98 were my least favourite.V/H/S is a mix of short films that are great and short films that aren't that interesting. V/H/S is a great low-budget found-footage horror film, that from BAD 1 to EXCELLENT 6 I give VERY GOOD 5.25.",V-H-S

125,mrda1981,A nightmare world on videotape,8,10 February 2013,"Arranged around and within a tenuous wraparound home invasion scenario, the vignettes that comprise this shakycam shocker prove memorably effective, each lulling the viewer into a false sense of security via meanderingly mundane set-ups that abruptly shift to more unnerving, visceral territory. Old tropes such as alien interference, haunted houses, serial killers, and femmes fatales find themselves fed through the lens of the hand-held camera to rather impressive effect. The overall picture painted by these series of snuff flicks-within-a-flick is one of a world sporadically at the mercy of an otherworldly array of entities, with the glaring unremarkability of its setting serving to amplify, rather than undermine, the atmosphere of cosmic malevolence. All these elements amount to a punchy anthology which succeeds in overriding my antipathy toward the dreaded jittercam technique - no mean feat!",V-H-S
126,craigh01,Weird horror movie,6,18 September 2017,"Well my one big complaint is the camera-work (the ""found footage"" genre) was making me dizzy. I was so happy at the parts where it became normal instead of jumping all over the place. So if that's going to bother you, you should probably skip it.Not really all that good, more of a collection of weird short stories. It held my interest though. It was good enough to keep my attention to the end. I wish they would have expanded on some of the stories a little more. They could have made it, say, 3 short stories and gave some explanation of what was going on.So, it could have been an 8 if it (a) get rid of the nauseating camera-work (b) expand on some of the short stories and give some background as to ""why""? or ""what were they doing""? (c) make it longer to give time to give more background. I bet the writers actually didn't know why, they'd have to put a lot more thought into it! Also, parts of it are quite gruesome, so if you don't like that, it would be another reason to skip it. It's not a stupid torture movie though. I don't mind a little gore if there's a reason and story behind it. Also it's not a slasher movie with some guy chasing pretty girls around with a knife. Leave that for the teenagers I guess.",V-H-S
127,theburrus1,Perhaps a fresh breath for the horror genre.,6,9 December 2012,"I completely stumbled upon this movie by accident in roaming from here and there on IMDb. Upon reading the synopsis, it sounded intriguing, and the same for the trailer. So indeed I downloaded it and watched it. I can say that while it was never as scary nor as gory as it is promoted to be, this film has a new type of screenplay, blending five short films into one, while each of them keeping unique and creative. While watching it, it does help to keep in mind that is being an Indie film, and probably filmed with a low budget, the cast and crew did a hell of a job in spite of adversity. I found the special effects to be the most entertaining thing about the film. I mean whenever they appear, they are believable. And that is why I give this 6 out of 10 instead of 5 of 10 on the ratings here. After watching it, I can recommend to any readers to watch the film ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" which is similar in some ways to this film, but in my opinion, however the fx were created, kudos to them and it helps this movie hold its head high throughout, and at just the right moments when it seems its about to trip over on itself.",V-H-S
128,TheDoomSong,Relying almost exclusively on jumpscares V/H/S is less entertaining than a lot of self made youtube videos,3,12 September 2012,"Anthologies are always hard to pull off, if you want to do it right. In most of them the quality of the different segments varies greatly and you only get to enjoy fragments of the movie while the project in its entirety fails to connect with the viewer. That is even more the case when the anthology is supposed to be tied together by another story arc that provides a decent beginning and ending while connecting each story to one another. V/H/S does not have this aspiration at all. The setup couldn't be more straight forward: A few guys are breaking into a house to steal an ominous video tape. They find a huge pile of tapes and proceed to watch all of them to find out which one they are supposed to get. As nonsensical as that sounds, it provides a good explanation to what you are going to watch in the following 90 minutes: shaky hand-held horror.V/H/S presents five ""spooky"" tapes (not including the beginning and the end) which at best make you twitch because they rely almost exclusively on jump scares. Where they don't they make absolutely no sense, are boring, uninspired and staged by terrible actors. The biggest disappointment is that none of the stories have a shred of originality in them. They all seem like cheap copies from the bottom of the creepypasta barrel. In fact the only thing missing was somebody screaming BUT WHO WAS PHONE?! after the credits had run through.All in all V/H/S is a huge letdown and does not justify any amount of money being spent on it.",V-H-S
129,starlimitz2,Happily Editing Added,6,21 January 2015,"A hopeless case of wasted potential. There was some serious creativity in some of these segments, but then there were the other three. The first one sets a good tone for the audience but then that just sets us up to be let down by the others, and little by little we see that some potential scares were flushed by either the directors not knowing how to end it, or some editing that seemingly ""fixed the problem of an ending."" I will give the movie credit, the jump scares were very seldom in this movie, and it relied on genuine creepy atmospheres, and creative use of editing (save for the last one.) There were even some things I didn't see coming at first, though they were not exactly surprising, they did the trick.Then there was the shaky cam, perhaps the worst shaky cam since Blair Witch. Even if you are not one to get nauseated easily, this will do the trick. It gets out of control sometimes.It's random, it can get boring, and some of the stories could have been deleted and no one would know the difference. Still, it was genuinely creepy in some moments, and it can be quite a fun ride here and there. It's worth watching if you like indie films and if you like horror films.",V-H-S
130,LessThanPaddy,By no means perfect...but.,7,21 February 2017,"I find it hard to find to find a good horror film nowadays. Most of them are dull and uninventive, prioritizing jumps and CGI over suspense or story. VHS, while not being a perfect horror film is surprisingly agreeable. I admit, the first segment preluding the first video story was confusing and I considered switching it off, but not for long. Found footage is leaning towards overkill these days, but VHS is a small reminder of how useful it can still be. It's divided into 5 stories respectively:The first story is strong. It builds up good suspense and you genuinely don't know what's going to happen except that it'll be something horrifying. It escalates fast and becomes pretty tense, followed by gory and then just plain terrifying. The monster involved will probably keep you awake at night...The second is different, it's tenser from early on but nowhere near as gory or as horrifying... in fact it's bewildering. A good story but not as strong as the former, although there is a twist that you probably won't see coming.The third is awful. It makes no sense (I'm not sure if it's supposed to) and the attempts at jump scaring in it are weak. I've watched this movie three times and I always switch off during this part and can't really take it in. Dull, like most modern horror films.The fourth is done really well and in a unique way. It holds a bewildering twist, but a good one. Also it has a few cameo jump scares. Arguably the best segment.The fifth plays on some of the strengths of the others. It's tense and jumpy, and not a bad story. The horror element isn't at all dull like the third segment, in fact quite the opposite. The camera is a bit trigger happy with its shakiness but that's a minor criticism. Overall, if you like horror films I can't see why you wouldn't like this one. Most modern examples are dull and poorly written, this one isn't so bad so give it a go if that's your thing.",V-H-S

I just wasn't impressed. I enjoy found footage films....usually.....this wasn't enjoyable. There are 6 basic parts to this movie. The first is the wrap around story. Frankly, I didn't like the characters at all and I didn't get the whole ""breaking into a house to steal an unknown, unidentified VHS tape for some third party"" storyline was vague and kind of senseless. The guys are disgusting pigs too. You're subjected to their crime spree before they break into the house. The wrap around story ends before the last video installment, which proved to feel unsatisfying.I didn't like the first 4 videos viewed. A couple had some creep factor, but none were truly scary. None of them were clever nor scary. The last story was actually pretty decent, but it came at the end and I was already quite bored. I see so many good reviews for this movie, but I just can't agree with them. I don't understand why my friend said it was scary.

So, here it is. First one, ""Amateur Night"": a group of idiots go clubbing and come back to their room with a couple of girls, one of which is VERY peculiar. Enjoyable and satisfying, it's always a pleasure to watch hateful characters get what they deserve. Vote 7. Second segment, ""Second Honeymoon"": a couple go for a road trip but they're not alone. Slow and underwhelming, the pace of the whole movie would have GREATLY benefited by having this sequence removed from the final cut. Vote 4. Third story, ""Tuesday the 17th"": four friends go hiking in the woods but one of them is hiding something important. No idea what they tried to do with this one, a total and utter mess. Vote 4,5. Fourth one, ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"": girlfriend senses a presence in her new apartment and asks boyfriend for help. Refreshing and captivating, probably the best of the bunch. Vote 7. Fifht and last segment, ""10/31/98"": frat boys look to have some good time at a horror-themed party, find no party but alot of horror. Not great, not terrible, very good visual effects. Vote 6.

They were all very strange and creepy segments full of gore and scares. Most of the stories were not too original, and some were very cliché, but they pulled off feeling like real found footage. ""Amateur Night"" was definitely my favorite of the bunch. Even though I knew what was going to happen due to spoilers, I still liked it the most and was not expecting how it ended. For me, the weakest segment was ""Second Honeymoon."" It was a bit of a letdown because I usually like Ti West's work and this piece was only so-so.

Some stories where cool but it would have made much more sense to have made individual movies out of each scene. This looked like a random collection of youtube flicks thrown together.... As one reviewer said, (not an exact quotation here), the POV method rarely works, as in never. I can honestly say that I was never really scared. There were a few scenes during the movie which had potential.

135,registers-944-48791,Lazy directors,3,25 January 2021,"I'm giving a start to the directors for the attempt to do something completely new. When doing something so diferent as this, sometimes it will just fail, and this is one of these times.All movies have 1 thing in common, they make us always think that something bad is around outise the camera angle and will soon attack whoever is filming. That's a very annoying feeling, specially to keep it holding almost the whole movie. It's a dumb and easy way to prepare for also dumb and easy jump scares.In all videos, the monsters and highly badly imagined and implemented. If at least the stories were good, we could accept it as a bad budget issue, but their stories are also flat and characters and 1-dimensional. Their fast pace takes out the chance to better develop them. IDK if directors are simply out of imagination, or if they are pushed to rush the production of the movie.The last video is the only one a bit better, but it also slips that it's rushed to end. There's rly the feeling of lazyness on producing the movie. Or maybe producers and directors simply don't care.The last chance of make any worth of the movie is the main plot, that would fit all videos together. But director didn't even bother to properly finish this main plot. In fact, from the begining I was expecting what ended up happening. And it was so obvious that I couldn't believe it did happen.It's the kind of movie that's so bad that you think if it was produced that way on purpose, from a bad taste director.",V-H-S

137,WildWombatt,"Review from someone that doesn't really enjoy ""found footage"" films...",7,25 August 2015,"To start off, I was hesitant to watch this movie because I don't personally enjoy these types of ""found footage"" films; but upon recommendations, I decided to watch it anyway. As a horror movie lover, I decided to try all horror movies no matter what the style of it is.Let me start off with the cons first: This movie is a collection of short horror video-footages. Half of the footages or films weren't even scary. To be as vague as possible, I only found 3 of the stories to be creepy, while the others gave me no suspense or thrill. I understand that these are found-footages type of films, but there are times when the camera shakes and spins a lot, which can induce headaches to people not used to these films.Pros: I actually got creeped out by some of the footages. A couple gave me this unsettling feeling. Most types of movies in this genre shoots for cheap/fake jump scares, but I found this movie really focusing on the scary element than by using a loud noise to make you jump! Some parts in the movie I even wanted to look away. I don't get scared easily and nothing made me jump, but this movie is good at making you feel on-edge and a little creeped out.In all, I would recommend this movie if you don't mind the video style. Even though half of the footages aren't scary, the ones that are eerie are definitely worth a watch.",V-H-S
138,complications123,A Couple of Bright Spots Amidst Far Too Much Garbage,2,7 July 2013,"There's been a fair bit of hype surrounding this ""film"" in the horror world, and it seemed like a neat idea, so I bit. I even took a Dramamine 30 minutes beforehand to prepare for all the shaky cam stuff. Unfortunately any shred of potential is wasted far too early, and there's never the nice little tie up that anthologies usually include to validate the frame narrative, which basically negates the film's existence as far as ""found footage"" is supposed to go.An immediate turn off is the infallible ability for the first characters we meet to spend a solid 10 minutes being the most repulsive humans ever conceived. There is nothing to like about them, and it isn't even possible to write them off as stupid teenagers since these men are the quintessential dirty old men before they get quite so old. If you're still watching after the upskirts vs. sexually assault women and record their breasts conversation, you really shouldn't because that's about as horrible as anything else in this anthology.I get why there's lots of blue screens and random clips of previous recordings and every other inadequacy of the format displayed, but its overused to no effect. We get it. It's called VHS. Let's move on. I also realize that with ""found footage"" we have to put up with a ton of boring crap as if to add to it's authenticity, but in an anthology the time needs to be used well. It needs to get us as vested as possible in the story and misdirect us enough not to predict the outcome. Instead of this however, we are treated to pointless conversations and every other dull happening of the human life. Sifting through all this to try and even get slightly creeped out is so tedious it's ultimately not worth it. Truly, what good there is to be gleaned from this atrocity is not worth sitting through the digital recreations of video tape shortcomings and found footage conventions.The frame story is pretty novel at first; when we think of VHSs now in the digital age it seems to symbolize something very clandestine, and in the film's context, certainly something dark, mysterious, and meant for few eyes. It almost feels like a grittier version of Cage's descent in 8MM. But after a few seconds, this glimmer is lost because these same abominable men roam around as lost as if they had landed on the moon. And upon finding hundreds of video tapes without knowing which one is right, some of them begin keeping the dead guy company and watching them. This is one of many happenings that just doesn't make any sense. The other men force this one guy to stay in the room with the dead man. Why??? The first story is probably the strongest, although most of it is a pain to struggle through. Here we are dealing with equally reprehensible monsters at perhaps a younger age who are rightfully mangled by what seems to be some kind of childlike vampire creature. There are a view nice little incidental touches such as the quick shot of her bizarre feet, but this quickly degenerates into mayhem where the camera serves no purpose but to catch incomprehensible glimpses of carnage. The woman is instantly creepy, but all the frat boy crap is so distracting there's no chance for any tension to be built up and the shock is expounded on poorly with a bit of a nonsense ending, not to mention no relevance to the sort of childishness of the creature.Number two is filled with painfully boring footage and turns out to be little more than some kind of slasher story whittled down to a few minutes. Again, no explanation for anything.The third story is equally horrible with what is either supposed to be a spoof or homage to Friday the 13th. I don't even begin to understand exactly what the girl who is hunting the killer has put together in her head; it's another bit of nonsense. I tend to think there was some decent potential for ""The Glitch"" but this story can barely even be called a story since so much is left to the imagination.The fourth also begins kind of decently except that for every bit of interesting conversation we're forced to endure mounds of useless banter. The climax approached spooky, but was ended so abruptly and with so little explanation and so few clues as to what exactly happened that it's initially confusing which quickly turns to disinterest. The tension is built up well here, but without any rewarding pay off.Five is another high point, probably the best overall story. Everything looks good, steadily increases in tension and intensity, and has a sufficiently evil if not cliché ending. But what is done right here is not worth all that has been done wrong to get here.Finally, the fifth actually starts after the conclusion of the frame story, which rapidly degenerates into some sort of inexplicable zombie attack with absolutely no relation to the video tapes whatsoever.Unsatisfying, distracting, nonsensical...a few words to describe this over-hyped monstrosity. There were bits of good horror hidden deep down, but not good enough to justify the rest of this anthology.",V-H-S

The only thing more amazing about how bad this is, was learning that they actually shot _a sequel_... a sequel of WHAT?

If, on the other hand, you prefer films that have a story or a plot or a point, I would recommend virtually ANY OTHER FILM EVER MADE. I've seen other films that I can say were just as bad, but I've never seen anything worse. Astonishingly and consistently lousy, it's not even remotely entertaining.

145,perkin2000,Not bad.,5,15 August 2012,"Anthology horror film. The wraparound is about a bunch of petty criminals who are told to break into a house and steal a VHS tape. Obviously by someone who still thinks it's 1998. They get in the house and find a bum-load of tapes and a dead bloke. Rather than doing anything logical, they decide to watch some of the tapes. The film breaks into five standalone mini-flicks. All of them, to varying levels of contrivance, use the found footage format.I actually like the found footage thing, it can be very effective, Blair Witch was great and the little known Brit film Exhibit A was excellent, nasty stuff. The style works particularly well in horror where it can cut corners by having stuff 'just happen', things need less explanation when they are witnessed by incidental cameras rather than framed in a traditional narrative. However, this film does feel like it's a little late to the party.Anyway, the first and last are the best efforts, the middle three feeling a bit like filler, although all entertaining enough. As with Trick 'R' Treat a few years ago, this film seems to have got the horror fans foaming at the arse with excitement, every review praising it beyond its true merit. I think this is indicative of the dull lack of originality in the horror genre these days. It's a good, entertaining film, but in no way a future classic.Meh, that'll do.

146,mikelepost,Very disappointing,5,8 September 2012,"V/H/S combines one of my favorite horror sub-genres (the horror anthology) with one of my least favorite (found footage). Unfortunately, the movie features very little of what I like about horror anthologies with all of the things that I find annoying about found footage tapes.The best horror anthologies work because many stories only really work in 15-20 minute segments, and even when one story is disappointing it's over fast enough and you move on to the next one. The best of the bunch (Creepshow, Trilogy of Terror, Tales from the Crypt, etc.) also show a creative variety with a variety of different characters, settings and types of stories. I also usually enjoy the ""frame"" story that provides one overall twist right at the end. Unfortunately the stories in V/H/S are highly under-developed and rather same-y after a while. Two of the five segments and the wrap-around feature borderline rapist fratboy types who receive a horrible comeuppance; this theme would work in one segment but it becomes repetitive. Like several of the segments, the central frame doesn't come to any definitive conclusion and leaves more questions than it answers. V/H/S may have worked better if the frame wasn't also told in camera POV style. The film features a lot of gore and nudity but most of it is gratuitous and unsexy. It really doesn't capture the EC Comics feel of a lot of the best of this type of film. Overall I felt that V/H/S was slavishly faithful to its central concept, at the expense of delivering real scares or even making sense. I'll give a real brief review of each segment, with minor spoilers:Amateur Night: A trio of college aged dooshbags head out on the town looking for women. One of the group is wearing glasses outfitted with a camera, in the hopes of filming one of his buddies doing the deed. Needless to say they pick up the absolute wrong woman. This one features a few legitimate scares and a decent ending but also feels under-baked. 6/10Second Honeymoon: A young married couple take a road trip to the Grand Canyon. They're stalked and pursued by a masked woman, who films them sleeping in their motel room with their own camera. The violence at the end is shocking but the twist has no context and makes no sense at all. A huge disappointment, given that this one was directed by Ti West, director of the excellent Innkeepers. 4/10Saturday the 17th: Very dumb ""meta-slasher"" with a lot of gore but another dumb twist and very annoying main characters. The villain (the Glitch) is interesting but again, really no point or answers. 5/10The Sick Thing that Happened to Emily When She was Younger: A young girl and her boyfriend, a doctor out of town on his residency, have a conversation about the girl's apparently haunted apartment. This one succeeds in being creepy and the gimmick, showing the story entirely through Skype conversations, was fun. Unfortunately we get more totally unnecessary nudity and the twist, while interesting, makes no sense at all. 6/1010/31/98: Four guys go to a Halloween party and end up at the WRONG house. This one is by far the most effects heavy and cinematic and really worked for those reasons. Some unanswered questions but overall pretty satisfying. Too bad it came last and I was bored by that point. 7/10The frame movie: 2/10. Sucked straight through.Overall an interesting failure.",V-H-S
147,seanebuckley,hit and miss.,5,11 September 2012,"Horror collections are always a mixed bag and VHS is no exception. The central conceit is simple and effective, a group of hideous out of control losers are tasked with stealing a solitary VHS tape from a strange house. When in the strange house they find a dead man with a serious VHS collection. The group then start to play various tapes to find the 'right' one and yep you guessed it, the segments are split by these very tapes.The movie starts and ends with its strongest pieces. The first two sections, 'Amatuer Night' and 'Second Honeymoon' offer scares and shocks in varying ways. 'Amatuer Night' is a exercise in disgust, we start out by watching pervy men as they try witlessly to get into womens underwear although this time they pick the wrong girl (cue the thunder). There are several more 'human' shocking moments before the true horror starts, with the girl exploding supernaturally into life. Its effective without ever being truly inspired but thats the breadth of the genre in a nutshell. The shorter run time of these segments also ensures that the viewer still appreciates the 'handheld' mise en scene by the conclusion of the piece.'Second Honeymoon' employs a much different tack and features Ti West's penchant for playing with human interaction and expectation. Here we watch as a couple fumble through a long distance trip, they seem a little off kilter and dread slowly seeps into the frame. Whilst they are asleep we witness an unnerving night time intrusion, this is easily the most effective sequence in the entire movie, our couple blissfully unaware of their danger. The segment bubbles to its shocking conclusion, leaving the audience with a myriad of questions.The movie ends with '10/31/98' which is easily the most 'fun' segment. Here we follow another band of typical American losers as they unwittingly uncover some serious supernatural goings on behind the shiny suburban streets of middle America. Yeah sure its nothing i haven't seen a million times before and done much better (the section has more than a whiff of Suspiria about it)but its well executed and is helped by the previous two segments lack of cohesion and quality. Its also fun watching the initial 'is this a real haunted house?' act the guys pull when the first arrive in the empty, creepy house as they assume that they have stumbled onto a elaborate house party.So onto the mid-section. 'Strange Thing Happened To Emily' is initially fun and full of promise. It is rather innovative as its all communicated through Skype, so we watch a guy as he talks to his girlfriend about her supposedly haunted house. The problem with the section is clearly the ending, it follows a much more of a 'Twilight Zone' path than the other sections and has a ball kicker of an ending. A lot of people will be taken by the gross out horror of the final reel but to me it seemed slightly odd and unsatisfying. Also, there are just too many questions and too many coincidences but then again maybe that was the point. For me, it just didn't work.'Tuesday the 17th' is pretty appalling for a multitude of reasons. Numero uno has to be the characters, where the f*ck do these people exist? So unlikeable, so stupid and so brain numbingly one dimensional. With a central conceit which is so slight, i should at least care about these guys and gals but they were so shallow, so familiar and so stupid. Secondly, who let a 4yr old write the screenplay (if there was one?), too much of it just doesn't make sense. Like what was the point of this segment? Why did the girl go back after her initial encounter with this monster? Are these people really friends? Why was the guy/monster in the forest in the first place? Why was he wearing that lovely red bandanna? I guess there is always going to one complete hack in every deck but this short takes the biscuit. Last but not least, the direction in this piece is dreadful. Even down to the kills which should form the basis of a piece like this but they are lazily CGI'd in post production. This obviously was to try and paint over the fact that this guy has no bloody clue how to shoot a scene that doesn't involve a pair of tits. Also, what was he thinking with the killer? Why does the camera start to falter every time he is around? What a crappy narrative device, 'I know what to do! when the main plot device is on screen i'll make it so we cant see him properly cause that surely wont annoy anyone...' no thanks. It has no beats, no structure and most importantly no merit.SO, it may not have Trick R Treats subversive streak or Tales From The Crypts ingenuity but it does have some genuinely shocking moments and for that i applaud the relevant film-makers but sadly they are too few and far between to merit repeat viewings.

I like anthologies as some of the stories are just the right length to keep you engaged, any longer and it might start getting boring. I have to say, I felt like I needed a shower after watching this. The stories are very disturbing, and most are quite realistic, especially the one with the couple at the motel. I won't give away the plot and go into detail, but it was horrible and turned my stomach a bit. Some of the camera work is a little too shaky for my taste, and I did have to look away sometimes, but otherwise it adds to the realism. After it ended, I was sat for a few minutes wondering what on earth I'd just watched, but in a good way. Definitely a recommended watch if you like the found footage genre.",V-H-S

Secondly: The separate short stories aren't all that scary and are equally as poor quality as the main narrative. There was nothing new or exciting about this movie. Each story was something i have seen many times before in other horror movies but executed much worse. I'll be honest..i turned it off after about the hour mark. I didn't see the point of finishing it as i wasn't invested in any of the characters, and there was no suspense or 'what happens next' emotions to keep me interested.Not very good at all.",V-H-S

It just kept popping up on horror lists and I felt the need to see what all the hype was about. Now I'm in the minority and don't mind, even like well-done found footage films. This was... well, a bit over the top determined to make it more real by jumping it all over the place. Kinda got used to it, but it was annoying. As far as anthologies go, I don't mind them, but you never really connect with a single character in this one. 1st story, hated every frat douche in it and was irritated it took so long to kill em off. 2nd one, married couple on a road trip were so boring I was happy for the annoying husband to get the switchblade. Actually kinda liked the one with the chick getting her organs harvested by her boyfriend, but it was underdeveloped and missing something, and not just a kidney. The last one (and there may have been more in between but just didn't make enough of an impression for me to remember) was meh.. Guys going to a Halloween party, they think, and find a chick getting tortured. May have been an exorcism, who knows? Anyway, I can cross this off my checklist. Finally got through it. Listen this is kinda watchable. I've seen worse. I'm an unabashed horror junkie, there's some delightfully awful ones to watch and enjoy. This has no delight, just not so good everything without the cheesy fun humor of bad horror because the filmakers actually thought it was scary. Seriously blog type people, take this off your lists.

It for me is like Trick or Treat (not as good though) and reminiscent of Tales from the Darkside. Kind of like those scary short story books you could get through the scholastic book club. I forgot the name of them. Not goosebumps but the more twisted ones that were all short stories.Some of the stories have been done before but they did put interesting twists on them. There was a lot of unique things in the movie as well and not just some of the stories. I found some of the characters movements and acting to be truly unique to the horror genre. You will have to see what I mean when you watch it.I wouldn't have paid money in the theater to see this but it is def worth a rent. Would be a lot of fun with a bunch of friends on Halloween.

So I was expecting it to be, straight on point with the stories but some of them really got me into thinking what I just saw. I needed to, really get into them which is the point of the movie about these VHS tapes. The tapes are fine with the exception of the second which is about a trip, that one was... too normal I guess, but it was fine. The others, are totally not like what I excepted. These tales are really make you feel weird and that is what this movie wants, but sometimes the beginning of them just too slow. At the end, I liked it really much.

155,sethklee-77687,V/H/S,6,8 December 2020,"When seeing that this is a low budget, anthology, found-footage horror movie, your first instinct may be to roll your eyes and disregard it. But, this really wasn't half bad. It kept my interest for the most part and can get genuinely creepy at times. It definitely has its issues though. For one, the quality widely varies between stories. The ""Tape 56"" and ""Second Honeymoon"" segments, especially the latter, were straight up bad. The found-footage aspect, with its frantic camerawork and glitches, can be taken too far and get annoying to watch. All of the stories also seemed to follow a similar path, which can grow to be boring.On the other hand, the ""Amateur Night"" segment in particular was great. It's unsettling, has a great atmosphere, and is well crafted. While the movie wasn't as good as I hoped it would be, I'd still say I enjoyed it overall. If you're a fan of the genre and can look past its flaws, ""V/H/S"" is worth a shot.You know quarantines got you messed up when you're considering the succubus.6/10",V-H-S
156,hinesgtrservice,Hype and Immense Disappointment,1,8 September 2012,"Really a massive disappointment. I had read over on a blog that this film would ""restore my faith in horror films"". I read all over the internet about just how great this film was. So I spent ten dollars to view it last night. The found footage idea isn't wholly a terrible idea, the problem is that it just doesn't usually work. By usually, I mean ever. Horror as a genre has been falling apart at the seams for years, and the advent of ""found- footage"" certainly hasn't helped. In fact, it feels like it's making a mockery out of horror rather than restoring it to glory. Enough about that. Regarding the film: The first problem we get here is that the writers/directors have two hours to piece together six cohesive stories. That's fine, but if that's the case, we need to only focus on the important stuff here. Half the time, you'll feel like you're watching some stranger's home movie collection. It's drab, it's boring, it doesn't serve to build suspense, it just drags. You see, when we only get twenty minutes with characters, we don't give a hoot about what they're like. All footage should serve the story, and it just doesn't here. So yes, a lot of the film dragged and a lot of the film was boring.The second huge problem: the scary stuff. There isn't enough of it. There isn't enough that was supposed to be there in the first place, and most of what you get is just goofy. There were a few jump scares that weren't done all that effectively due to some of the worst camera work the world has ever seen. We understand that this is supposed to be amateur shot footage. That doesn't mean people film themselves walking around with friends while wildly waving their arms around like a complete lunatic. So when you aren't sure what you're looking at and your eyes are constantly struggling to adjust, the few jump scares that were put in the film no longer serve a purpose. I'm not sure if my next complaint should be lodged against the actors or the writers. Maybe both? All of the characters, I mean ALL of the characters, are incredibly unlikable or plain bothersome. There's a character that basically just cackles through an entire story. There's a character that has no personality aside from leaving her mouth agape at all times. So yeah, the acting was pretty bad, but the writing was probably the worst part of the whole thing. One story in particular was such a joke on the writing front, we couldn't contain our laughter watching it. Not because it was supposed to be funny either. So here we have six basically nonsensical and incomprehensible stories that lack direction, character, motivations or scares and we throw it all together to create one low-res pile of crap. We have scenes that make NO SENSE in regards to how it ended up on a VHS tape, uninspired concepts, terrible camera work, and just terrible writing.Here is another Paranormal Activity: TONS of hype, great press and reviews, but underneath all of that is a really uniquely awful film. I'm serious; I thought it was really that bad. Uniquely awful in just how inept and uninspired it is.Want a compilation horror film that tries to tackle a few sub-genres of horror? Try Trick-R-Treat. It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was enjoyable and well written. V/H/S is something I hope dies and people forget about by Christmas. What an awful, awful film.",V-H-S

It's another entry in the horror anthology sub-genre, only this time it's a collection of 'found footage"" shorts that have little relation to one another (or the wraparound story, for that matter). The first two segments were much better than the other ones. Most of the segments contained zombies or evil spirits, which got a little stale after a while.

The effects are pretty good and although you can clearly question some of the actions the characters take, there is a mantra that says ""Without dumb people, there is no horror movie script"". Actually I've made this up, but you get the point. The movie never tires the spectator because it follows several different recordings. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just leave here my suggestion: Enjoy the experience. Put yourself in these situations. Don't expect to understand what is going on more than the characters themselves. Have you ever watched Cloverfield? The thrill of the unknown is often more rewarding than a step-by-step explanation of every single thing you find in a movie.Warning: If you are susceptible to dizziness or feel a level of discomfort above normal while watching flashing lights of chaotic camera movement, this movie is not for you (it has more of these features than the average handy-cam movie).",V-H-S
161,danteasdale458,The Best Found Footage Film ever made,8,5 October 2012,"V/H/S is created as an anthology. A group of young guys are paid to go into a house and steal a particular tape. During this time, one of the guys finds a stack of tapes located in a room with a seemingly dead older man sitting in a chair. There starts the viewing of the tapes.There are 5 segments each created by a different director(including my man Ti West).What really puts this movie above everything else in its genre, is its ability to do something different. Each segment has a different and creative way to use the ""found footage"" style. The first one was done with a group of guys going to a bar trying to hook up with girls. He has a camera actually built in his glasses so you see everything he sees. The last segment was during Halloween in which another group of young guys are off to a Halloween party. The way they do the footage here, is that the camera is located the bear outfits head(being worn by one of the guys).My personal favorite style used, was a sort of ""face-time"" style. All the video shown was through a webcam on a laptop. In the bottom right was the person the young girl was talking to. This part was created so brilliantly. It didn't have to rely on gimmicks to completely shock the crap out of me. While not my favorite segment, it's style is unmatched in anything I've ever seen.The movie is extremely violent to the level of disturbingly realistic. I also liked that the camera doesn't ""mess up"" during action parts. A lot of other movies use certain camera glitches that block a lot of what's going on. While V/H/S has these, they are not used in important scenes. They are used really well and are fitting to what's going on but not once was used as a way to screw us over as a viewer. I'm not sure what the budget was on this, but it looked perfect for what it was trying to do. It had low resolution cameras(on purpose of course. Since these are.... VHS tapes) but everything else looked high end. The gore looks real, and a lot of effects used and make up looks really top notch. The last segment, my favorite, shows off more of the budget. It was done so incredibly well and in only a few shots. I was shocked at how they were able to pull certain things off without a camera take. V/H/S is that masterpiece of horror cinema not many will watch. It's filmed brilliantly, well acted, very violent, the effects are top notch and the movie is so damn good at creating suspense with great camera work and characters.I'd recommend V/H/S to anyone who likes horror movies and can deal with excessive and real violence. I know many people are sick of the ""found footage"" style of films, but V/H/S adds so much originality and brilliance to that style, that it should not be over looked.",V-H-S

Goes all the way back to Blair Witch Project and I have seen several that do an to good job of storytelling and such. This is one of those films that is WAY WAY too long for what it was trying to achieve.Without giving too much away, a group of Jackass wannabe's get the chance to make some serious cash by simply retrieving a VHS tape from a mans home. What comes afterward is the basis of several ""stories"" (kinda like Paranormal Activity meets Creepshow). The segments are seen by the intruders.There is a LOT of boring stuff in this movie that could have easily been removed. The scares are OK up to good when they happen, but they happen few and far between. The first real ""scare"" of the movie does not even take place until almost 1/4 of the way in the movie. I found myself fast-forwarding A LOT to get to the good parts. Acting is decent, budget is good despite grainy hand-held footage throughout. The concept of this movie is pretty good just poorly executed with time-consuming dialogue that is truly not needed.Of the ""stories"" the third one was my favorite. The first one was good but took WAY to long to get into and the ending seemed almost rushed.If you are an extremely patient person, this movie may be for you but I gave it 4.5 out of 10 stars.

The thing that hits it off for me in a horror movie is the degree of believability and the degree of likability. This movie had neither. Almost every character in the five different stories was annoying, smug, and generally unlikeable. I actually wanted whatever demon or spirit to kill them all by the end of it. The whole movie was so random and so incomprehensible, rendered worse by the ramblings of whoever's on screen. I couldn't understand what we was being mouthed 90% of the time.

It's hardly some sleeper classic waiting to be discovered, merely a nifty spin on the new cinema-verite wave the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise has inflicted upon us. Those aggrieved folks who've taken to the Internets to complain about motion sickness and the unsteady photography, now a dozen-plus years after the Blair Witch bonanza, are mostly revealing their own naivete or stupidity; likewise the wannabe intellectual deploying his or her wide vocabulary in the cause of calling these characters ""sexist"" ""d-bag"" ""bros"" etc.--have you never seen a horror movie before? This would not make the Top 5,000 list of most misogynistic slasher/splatter/stalker/Satanist/vampire/party-clown films; but seeing it in the context of an amateur recording sure puts that behavior in a different light, doesn't it... The prime flaw of VHS lies with the frame plot, which is difficult to get into, harder to follow, and at the end of the day just not a very good cover to furnish an excuse for a bunch of high-concept experimental horror shorts. These ""lost footage"" chapters of the film are reliably enjoyable in sequence despite having nothing, at all, to do with each other. Generally I felt they worked better as black comedy than suspense-thriller pieces, with the common flavor of cynical humor which was subtle in some, more overt in others (on the patented Goldilocks scale the first tape is just right). The Camp Crystal Lake parody segment directed by Glenn McQuaid is neither scary nor coherent, yet manages to stay weirdly compelling for all of its brief run.

Its different, like no other movie I have ever come across and that's what immediately grabbed my attention. While it isn't really scary I don't think that makes it any less good. I mean what movies are scary anymore? The Conjuring? Insidious? Saw? I don't think so, to me they're all just recycled movies that might creep me out to a minor extent at best but V/H/S/ at least brings you something new to the table. This movie isn't perfect, as you can see I rate it 7 out of 10. A rating I also gave Insidious but I definitely prefer this movie over insidious. I also rather liked that it was a collaboration of shorts, which is weird because I never liked things like Tales Of The Dark side in the past. Unlike that, these shorts were great, Creative, executed well. Other than the arguably sub par acting in the Glitchman short the rest of the acting was brilliant and for exactly the type of movie it was. The only short I wasn't all there for was The Second Honeymoon but that's only personal preference, I've always been unmoved and bored by killer movies and preferred supernatural horror being that its so mysterious and uncontrollable. You may feel differently and like Second Honeymoon.All and all, definitely creative and worth a watch for most. Don't be discouraged over its lower rating. Apparently there was a lot of buzz about this film prior to its take off in popularity which I think caused too many people to set too high of expectations. Many criticize that it doesn't have a plot. This isn't true, it has a plot. A very small plot, like a set up plot really, leaving so much mystery in its wake and I think that's a strongpoint. It leads a little more into it with V/H/S/ 2 but still keeps that mystery strong leaving more to your imagination which is refreshing because isn't it our own imaginations that terrify us the most.In a genre that hasn't given us anything memorable in the past 5 years or so I think V/H/S/ while not perfect, is the best we have gotten in awhile and I also would definitely recommend V/H/S/ 2, which I believe to be even better. Skip out on V/H/S/ Viral though, the 3rd installment, that movie is what happens when a low budget title gains popularity and begins trying too hard. Ironically it has more of a plot than the first two, less is more.",V-H-S
170,mutisufi,"Surely scary to some, at the very least entertaining",7,11 December 2012,"For this new genre of film, the ""reality horror film"", this is the best one I've seen since the first Paranormal Activity. Though I despise all reality based shows (yes, I use the term loosely and with the understanding that most if not all of this ""reality"" is scripted and its more a style than an actuality), occasionally a film will sneak by and be decent enough to watch. Bizarre as all get out and Im sure some would find it legitimately scary as well. At the very least it was certainly an entertaining way to spend 2 hours and distract ones self from the realities of life. Not one Id heard of before but definitely one worth watching.",V-H-S
171,blakkdog,Disappointing,3,10 September 2014,"Not too much of a 'found footage' fan with a few notable exceptions. It generally tends to be a gimmick more than a useful artistic tool and it so easily seems forced and becomes eye rollingly over the top very easily. This definitely is the case with this film which just seems to be a collection of 'found film' horror shorts cobbled together under the excuse that the idiots from the initial scene who also film themselves doing bad things have to watch each of these tapes while robbing a house before getting killed themselves. This premise is ridiculous and weak for starters. Then so much of the found footage aspect doesn't feel natural and seems forced to try to show the audience the ""best parts"" in a way that feels edited way too conveniently and in many sequences where the fact that someone is still filming is just hard to buy. We get jumps between random useless ""normal"" conversation snippets or useless action to gruesome helter skelter action shots where running with the camera seems to be a constant no matter how much of a panic the camera holder may be in and always ending with cameras ALWAYS falling conveniently so that they aim right where something nasty is taking place like disemboweling or fetus removal.Once I realized there was no connection between any of the films (I was ready for the film to be about Succubus creatures after the first short) and that there was no connection between the initial characters and any of the films, I kind of let go and took in each short. Some are better than others (the first is the best) but the simple fact that the whole film is a big excuse to watch bad found footage films gives the film the feel of something cheap, unimaginative and based on all the dark and prurient desires of your average frat brother. And it really comes off as Blair Witch Project meets Bang Bus because of that...And I guess we are supposed to be more likely to ignore enormous plot holes in some of the shorts simply because: who cares! they are shorts where the fun is watching people get naked and/or brutally killed in awesome found footage! I can entertain this to a certain extent but when a chick apparently goes into the woods haunted by a phase shifting supernatural killer who kills all her friends and she somehow escapes and she goes BACK to those woods ALONE to set up a series of complex human traps (all 5'2"", 110 pounds of her!) to catch said supernatural killer and the killer doesn't hassle her in the process but sure as heck goes after her and her friends when she comes back a third time? sorry... In the end the film is essentially about 'found film' characters who watch 'found film' tapes and get killed in the process to create yet another 'found film' film. So its like 'found film' squared and its way way too much... Heres a thought: make a real horror movie out of ONE of these stories. Several of them could probably support being a full length feature and not some stunted found footage B movie mutation of a Twilight Zone episode.",V-H-S
172,ThomasBleedPHD,V/H/S: It is what it is,6,8 November 2015,"Found footage isn't one of the best Hollywood trends out there IMO. I hate seeing scenes pigeon-holed into a shaky camcorder, I hate all the massive plot holes that come up from the very concept itself, and I really hate how they never look like actual videos someone is taking. Don't get me wrong, it's way better than the Torture Porn trend Eli Roth started, but it's still annoying. And because these movies are so incredibly easy and cheap to make, it looks like we're stuck with them.But as long as they're not going away, I suppose you can do a lot worse than V/H/S. I've certainly seen far worse horror movies from this genre, with worse execution and definitely worse concepts.V/H/S is a horror anthology film - something you don't really see all that much. It's a great concept, hell one of my favorite horror movies of all time is Creepshow. This film is built up from five stories and a framing device, all of varying quality.The framing device is pretty much just there because it has to be. It strings all the stories together in a really vague way and doesn't explain or elaborate on anything interesting. The big twist at the end of it has nothing to do with anything and feels like it's just there because they thought they needed a stinger.The first real story, however, is a real hoot. It starts off with this grating, annoying frat-boy stereotype characters but slowly gets better as it progresses. Despite starting out rough it slowly gets better and better until the big ending twist where everything goes off the rails.Immediately following what might be the best story in the movie is what is easily the worst. Absolutely nothing at all happens in this story happens until the very end, and the twist feels tacked on and forced instead of shocking. It's barely even a horror story.The third story is pretty fun, since it feels like a weird hybrid between a Blair Witch-style found footage film and a classic 80's slasher flick. The monster in it is pretty cool too. It certainly isn't high art, but it's fun to watch.The fourth story is told entirely from a series of webcam chats. It deals with some sci-fi type stuff. The guy playing the male lead in this story puts up a terrific performance but the budget for this film really hurts it, the effects are pretty bad. Still, it's one of the more effective stories.The final story is nothing special, but not offensively bad. It's all about a supposed Halloween party that goes horribly awry. I really don't have any strong opinions on this one way or another, which is probably a bad thing for a closing story. But whatever.All the stories seem to share a common theme of deception and people masquerading as something they aren't. It's interesting that all the stories are bound together in that way, but otherwise they have absolutely nothing to do with each other or the framing device. The framing device, by the way, could have been totally left out of the movie and it would have been fine.V/H/S is what it is. A serviceable horror film you can watch on Netflix or rent on DVD and not feel terribly ripped off. It's a good party film. But it's nothing spectacular or even that memorable. But as far as the terrible found footage genre goes, it's one of the better ones.",V-H-S
173,dziemke,No connections,5,10 July 2014,"I will agree the individual segments were good. Well directed and (mostly) well acted. I was hooked for the first 60% of the film. The lake scene began to lose me because I thought the acting was sub-par compared to the first part of the film and I was looking for connections with the previous segments. Overall, the film needs a connection among all of the segments...all of the ""tapes"". But I never found one. The house the burglars break in to , with all the TVs and tapes and the dead guy was not enough to connect everything. Individual segments were mostly well-done and well directed. Scary, creepy, and with some innovative concepts of horror. But, overall, I didn't get a sense that the film was one whole story. It seems just a random group of ""This would be cool if..."" segments vaguely strung together with the guys in the house. So, I give it 5 stars. I think it could be better, and it had moments that hooked me.",V-H-S

I found the stories to be quite creative for the most part and really kept you on the edge for most of the movie. Now not to say this movie doesn't have its flaws (some scenes were unnecessary and there isn't a very strong plot) but if you can watch this going into it knowing not to try and focus to much on the overall plot and focus more on the individual stories I guarantee you will enjoy it.

How about by telling you not to waste your time at all. I'm unbiased yet critical in my reviews, I will admit, but this movie deserves to be destroyed and never shown to the public. Ever. I'm highly disappointed, the previews made this look good and I couldn't wait for it to come out. It's B list work at best. The cast is a group of unknowns but it wouldn't even be considered a ""good movie"" if the cast was made up of more recognizable faces. The fact that people are trying to pass this off as ""found footage"" is sad. For a ""found footage"" film to be successful, the story as to why it was recorded in the first place should be plausible at best. The 5 ""found footage"" VHS tapes/stories that make up the length of this movie are no where near plausible by any means. There are very few scares, if any at all. The only parts you could consider scary are when there's a sudden loud noise you weren't expecting or a quick turn of the camera towards something you weren't expecting. But don't get me wrong, even those typical hallmark scares aren't even scary in this particular film.If you want to add two hours of disappointment into your day, then I would suggest watching this movie.",V-H-S
178,pwmartuneac,"Excellent, dark, and gritty",9,3 September 2012,"This is one of those horror movies that it supposed to tap into the most basic and primal fear that is in all of us: the fear of the unknown. And it does this very well. The basic plot is simple: this group of douchebags go around destroying property and assaulting women to videotape their boobs and sell the footage. They then get a ""contract"" or something to break into some guy's house and steal a particular VHS tape. Well, when they get there, the owner of the house is apparently dead, and he as a MOUNTAIN of VHS tapes. So as they're trying to find the one tape, one member of the group begins watching random tapes.This is where the movie plays on your fear of the unknown. There's no backstory to any of these tapes. No explanations, no settings, no telling how this guy got these videos and why he has them. The tapes themselves are reminiscent of a Stephen King style short story, where the most depraved human behavior is showcased. Some of the tapes are legitimately scary, others are scary in a weird way, and some just make you hate the people in them.All in all, this was a very well done movie. As I said before, it plays very well on your fear of the unknown by having no backstory, no explanations, no lines to connect. It just is. And as for the people who are giving this movie such scathing reviews, I guarantee they're the ones in the theater who are always whispering to their friends, ""What's going on? What just happened? Wait, who's that? I thought he was a good guy! I'm lost!"" If you're expecting this to be the type of movie where you have to connect the dots or there's some deep-seeded plot, then you will be disappointed.

179,svartamoln,You either love it or hate it.,7,10 January 2015,"I was very reluctant about watching this movie after reading the mixed reviews here on IMDb but I dared to watch it knowing it could be a waste of time, luckily it wasn't. First of all, this is not the typical movie you're gonna watch on TV, it's odd and actually doesn't have a storyline defined because it's just a compilation of videos found in an old house. Many of you (probably) will find really annoying the fact the camera move a lot, the videos aren't filmed by any professional so it's quite annoying at first but after a few minutes you end up getting used to it, besides the movie is not made to be enjoyable by all, some can love it but others can just hate it so if you are one of those guys who loves watching traditional movies, don't watch this but if you are one of those guys who loves watching leaked videos on the internet, then this is the one for you. The videos shown in the movie are really realistic, the acting was very good and the effects quite cool as well.

180,remyarcher,Nothing 'horror'-able about this horror movie.,2,26 September 2012,"SHORT VERSION: The concept is actually scarier than the movie itself. After watching it alone in a dark room I got to the end and thought to myself...'That's it???!' Was not impressed and felt let down. It's as if the screenwriters simply took their favorite horror genre movies and converted them to shaky, grainy, video format. Blahhh.LONG VERSION: I was so stoked to see this when I first watched the teaser trailer, thinking to myself 'finally, some real horror!' after years of being offered torture-porn disguised as horror (Saw, Hostel, and the like). I AM a fan of found footage movies dating back to the seminal 'Blair Witch Project' - which by now, love it or hate it, is the godfather of the entire genre. But what made 'BWP' so eerily effective was the fact that the evil was never actually SEEN, only implied, so in effect we viewers all freaked ourselves out at the thought of what happened. 'Cloverfield' worked because we never got to see the monster in its entirety (for 95% of the movie), but we could see and live through the real time terror felt by the party-goers. '(REC)' and '(REC)2' (but not Quarantine)- worked because of the apocalyptic claustrophobia and sense of hopelessness being captured on film in the apartment building (and of course the shocking revelation of the infection, which scared the crap out of me!) None of these elements are found in 'VHS'. VHS is essentially 'Creepshow' for the hand-held generation. But where Creepshow was truly icky and tongue-in-cheek and at times campy - VHS simply revisits everything that has been done time and again (vampire, killer in the woods, haunted house), only to the tune of shaky camera work. I mean, really - how many ways can you kill teenagers in the woods? How scary is found footage anymore? I was waiting to be grossed out or at least disturbed. I found myself staring directly at the screen, waiting for that jumping feeling that never happened. The found footage genre isn't exactly dead YET; little seen 'Chronicle' was a delightful surprise! And 'Catfish' wasn't horror, but was definitely unsettling for stripping away the reality of online profiling. The first 'Paranormal Activity' had me covering my eyes because it just looked so real it got under my skin.But for me, 'VHS' does nothing new to this over-saturated market. It declares the found footage horror genre dead in the water.",V-H-S
181,jackseney,Well-Done Low-Budget Horror,7,15 July 2019,"""VHS"" is a somewhat roughly made low budget horror anthology movie including contributions from Bloody Disgusting.com type of people and others. Each short film in it has the notion of being shot with a character's handheld video camera.The roughness of this production I would assume is supposed to be part of the horror fun, and for me it was. So too with the inconsistencies regarding who's holding the cameras and how does the filming seem to go on in the midst of all kinds of chaos. If you're not going to suspend some disbelief when watching such movies, then you probably shouldn't bother with them. On the other hand such movies should not make such a great big deal out of the video angle that it becomes a distraction in itself, so that disbelief suspension is near impossible. ""VHS"" strikes the balance well enough between these factors in my view.The stories here include a group of drunken guys out on the town looking for girls on a summer night of partying. They take some chicks to a motel room, including a rather strange big-eyed girl who talks oddly. Then there's one about a couple driving to Vegas who appear to be being eerily stalked in the towns they stop in. Then there's another bunch of party guys who end up in a big spooky house on Halloween. A girl being haunted in her home who talks via video link with her boyfriend. And a group of dopey friends going swimming at a lake but finding horror in the woods.The wraparound story has to do with yet more wastrels who have been paid to break into a house and steal a VHS tape. The videos they watch make up the movies we see.The gore is fairly good here and is present in each episode. There are standout moments with a throat-cutting, a monstrous person butchering folks on-camera, a person digging skin-crawlingly into their own strangely wounded arm, a character having horrific things removed from their gut, and on and on.Some complain that this movie ""should have been shorter,"" but I think the way it takes its time is fine and builds tension in a slow, creeping manner.This is viewable on Hulu and possibly on You Tube and is recommended for those low budget horror fans like me who will enjoy it most.",V-H-S
182,nrkist2424,READ THIS Review before purchasing VOD/itunes - Spoilers,1,3 September 2012,"I had heard a lot of hype concerning this film through Bloody Disgusting and was eager to get this VOD when I discovered it was available...this information again revealed by none other than Bloody Disgusting. After sitting through incomplete and poorly executed short after short, and as I try and figure out WHY this had so much buzz about it...the credits roll. Who's name do you think comes up a TON? Brad Miska! AKA Mr Disgusting, the guy that runs Bloody Disgusting. This film is definitely bloody disgusting but not in the way you think. I'm surprised Ti West was involved with this, though I don't care to know which segment was his as they are all awful.Wrap-around: 30 something douchers acting like angsty pre-teens inexplicably move from assaulting couples for the purpose of filming boobs, to home invasion to find a VHS tape. We get into the group dynamic when a heated discussion arises whether they should grow their brand from filming boobs to filming asses as well, which inevitably escalates to someone smashing a TV with a bat. Let it be known, that it's strictly boobs -- and stealing creepy tapes -- from here on out. They have no idea what tape they are supposed to take in a home filled with 'creepy' tapes. Why are they still there?! There are way too many tapes to take. They are all strange. They have no idea what they are looking for. Let's sit down and watch some of the strange tapes? How will that help you find this needle in a haystack. The most poor thing about this wraparound...is that we never discovered the tape they were looking for that might have shed light on this clumsy setup.First Tape: Definitely the strongest, though it ended very weirdly. I thought the girl was some sort of feral cat-woman. The story plays this up pretty nicely...and in the last 30 seconds throws that all out the window revealing that she is full-on vampire with bat-wings...sigh. I will reiterate that this is the strongest tale.Second Tape: Some newlyweds(?) go on a boring roadtrip. Of course they must record every minute of this tired, banal odyssey. If you think the level of contrivance for why the camera is running is high at this point, just wait for the reveal...Third Tape: Awful. Kid's go to lake to get high and screw and get massacred. The 'twist' is that one of the girls planned this to lure out a madman that had killed her friends years ago. The second 'twist' is that he's paranormal and can't be filmed. The third 'twist' is...I dunno. If the first part of this short is a mess, the third act is the inevitable mindless lobotomized result.Fourth Tape: Nothing in this one makes sense. It also isn't scary. The characters are all annoying. I can't believe this even survived the cutting room floor and made it in THIS horrible anthology.Fifth Tape: The finale! The tale is pretty lackluster and seems like a student film project focusing on CGI effects work.Did I mention that the wraparound ended before the fifth tape was even played? Sloppy at every step.Good one Brad Miska, you conned your entire community to make a quick buck on your crappy film. No wonder you concealed the fact that this was your aborted baby while punching it up all over Bloody Disgusting for months.",V-H-S

I would have been livid if I had paid money for this joke of a movie.Note: I am a huge fan of horror, so please do not think my review comes from a lack of knowledge of the genre.Now, as for this film directly - it was more than clear that the target audience was males 15 - 25 due to the ridiculous amount of boobs, and the ridiculous amount of men around that age behaving like idiots. This movie made all men out to be drunken, sex obsessed buffoons. The first story was probably the worst of this, with the characters being so annoying I could barely stand it. This story should just flat out be removed from the movie. It's AWFUL.Moving beyond that stupidity, you have some stories with excellent potential, but none of them panned out. There were a few genuinely tense moments, all of which were ruined by one thing or another (leaving out details to avoid spoilers). Worst of all were the plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon, particularly in the last story, and the tie-in story. Overall, the whole thing is an insult to a thinking horror fan.

If you're an avid horror fan like me, make sure not to miss this one. It is very well thought out, and you can tell it took time and planning to make it. The effects and gore are about as good as it gets, and IMO very realistic. People who criticize this film don't appreciate what goes into making a film like this. It is way, way more complicated than just grabbing a few old cameras and start shooting people talking and doing stuff. When you start looking at all the little details, with a director mindset (as in - if I was filming this scene, how would I have done it), then you start appreciating all the little nuances and things they have put into it. Very well done, and I cannot wait for the sequel. If you like this movie, make sure to also check out the excellent movie The Tunnel. One of the scariest I have seen.",V-H-S
189,RIP_Mizz,Basic Horror Films,6,9 August 2012,"It's about what I expected from it but I have a heart for films that show a series of short films. It's about these masked criminals sent to get a VHS and find a few VHS tapes and watches them not knowing the danger they are in. This story isn't really interesting and kinda disappointing overall since it's the main storyline but lets talk about the VHS tapes shall weFirst VHS tape is titled Amateur Night. This might be the best of the group. It was definitely the most scariest of the group. It's about three guys who are going out to clubs and they make one of them wear glasses so they can see some ""action"". Anyways so they finally met some girls and one of the girls is strange and ""likes"" the guy with the glasses. Overall I probably give this one a 8/10. It wasn't perfect but I enjoyed it Second VHS tape is called Second Honeymoon. It's about a couple on their second honeymoon I guess. They see lots of stuff and kinda feels like you're just watching a boring vacation tape. They have fake future teller thing like the one on Big the movie tell their future and it gives them a interesting answer and later on in the hotel a girl ask them to take her for a ride and the husband declines. Overall this film was bad. It just seem to me they only cared about the twist and nothing else and the twist was a bad twist in my opinion. Their one part of the film that is really creepy and scary and could have been done much better but they decided not to run with that idea more I guess. Overall rating 3/10Third VHS Tape is called Tuesday the 17th. Funny title for this is because it reminds me a lot of Friday the 13th movie series. It's about two guys and two girls going out to the woods to swim in a lake I guess. There not much I can say about this film without giving away. I'll just say it feels like your typical slasher film. If you like the Friday the 13th movie series a lot then you will probably enjoy it. I thought it was just okay. Overall rating I give 5/10.Fourth VHS tape is called The Sick thing that Happened to Emily When She was Younger. It's basically about a couple who are doing a web cam call. One of them is a doctor and he's away on business so he's talking to his girlfriend from his web cam. The girl is paranoid about a bump on her arm and thinking her house is haunted. This one was very interesting and I may have liked this one the best. I like the idea of watching two people talk on web cam instead of a typical video camera cause it felt more realistic. If you're talking to your loved one on cam and you want to show them something you are scared about you will show them while running the cam instead of holding a camera in your hand and running for no reason what so ever and not putting the camera down like they did in Cloverfield. I give this film a 8/10. The ending was a little disappointing and you may be unsatisfied with the lack of information they give you.Fifth VHS tape is called 10/31/98. It's about four guys who are going to a party but find out nobody is at the party and sees very interesting and creepy things in the house. This one was okay but didn't really have a point just to show scary and creepy things. It was nice seeing some of the stuff on the old VHS camera stuff. It made the cgi effects look more real that way in my opinion. Overall I give this film a 6/10. It was scary and fun but felt kinda pointless. Kinda feel like the fake videos out there of ghost stories.Overall the film was just okay. It brings back old memories as a child watching the old horror films which was good but I figured it could have been done better. Every film is different in their own ways. Not all are the same horror slasher film type or paranormal activity type. All have different type of horror genre. The shaky camera didn't bother me much but it may bother you some. I say maybe rent it but it's not a film I would want to buy.",V-H-S
190,kolrimes,V/H/S---We get the point,2,16 October 2012,"Back in the days of VHS recording, I guess everyone just naturally had a camera, just the way it seems like everyone is using their phones or other digital recorders these days. Going even farther back to the horrid days of 16mm ""home movies,"" I shudder to remember the boring sequences of family vacations and the like that we were all forced by politeness to endure. Most of VHS is like this: a dull prologue leading up to an anticipated scene of unexplained horror. Sorry but it is monotonous, and it has been done enough. And we very soon get the point: something terrifying is on the way. Just sit there and be patient and wait. Eat your overpriced popcorn.An interesting story would have been (and this is a spoiler) just which VHS the guys were sent in to find and why. I mean the whole collection was weirdly asinine, so why did these boys have to look for just one? And while were at it, is this some sort of signature of modernity that the characters have to constantly keep calling one another ""dude"" and ""man"" That kind of dialog gets really grating after a while. It has been a long time since I felt I had to address someone as ""dude,"" and I'm not sure why I even did it then. English has a very weak vocative---unless you're black---and I suppose we need a way of addressing one another without using a name. Dull, predictable movie.",V-H-S
191,andreas-hein1993,"Horrifying, but could have been done better",6,26 June 2013,"V/H/S includes several short horror stories, bound together by a very cheap plot. Each of the stories are contains some awfully terrifying moments, but what was truly disappointing was the lack of a link between the stories.This movie does show people that a horror movie does not need to long nor does it need a lot of build-up to drag you right in on the horrifying action.V/H/S spends little to no time preparing the audience for what is coming, and instead the movie throws you into a series of fast-phased terrors. I consider this both a good and a bad attribute as it makes sure you never know what is ahead. Personally I would have preferred a more obvious link between the series of short movies, to create a higher purpose so to say.V/H/S does not spend a long time building up its scary scenes. But when the scare jump at you, they will not let you go for quite a while. The movie does a good job at keeping the unknown entity of each of the short stories, well veiled and introduces you to the danger at a very satisfying phase.Constantly having to fear new dangers, and never knowing whats coming next, is what makes this movie worth the while watching, and though it lacks some kind of a deeper meaning, V/H/S is a great addition to the genre of horror movies, and will scare you out of your skin at several times.Why should you watch this movie?V/H/S is scary and will give you some good thoughtless entertainment. If you are looking for a movie that you can spend hours reflecting upon after watching, this is not it. But if you are looking for some good scares without caring to much about the plot behind the scare, V/H/S is the movie to go to.Helix Horrible Reviews",V-H-S
192,huggiebearthedestroyer,One of the best anthology's I've ever seen.,8,31 July 2014,"This is a movie you can either hate or love, and I'm one of the people that adores it. This is one of the scariest movie's I've seen in my entire life, and one of the best. The effects are top notch, the acting was believable, and the stories were some of the most creative ones I've seen in my days. Yes, there are a few gripes and some parts I hold higher than others, but it is done in a realistic fashion and beautifully shot. The best segment was probably ""Amateur Night"". Yes, this one involves the ""I like you"" girl, who I actually found pretty attractive (Although there are some speculations on what she actually IS in the film. A vampire? Succubus? We may never know.)But the downside is that I can't really recommend this film to people with weak stomachs or are censorship crazy, as this film is HEAVY with nudity, language and gore. Still does that make this bad? Not too much. The VHS tape is literally shot over a sex tape, and that shows off some of the tones of the movie. It's also a found footage movie, and I normally hate those, but here it works. I plan to own both this and it's sequels on Blu-Ray or at least on DVD, and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",V-H-S

""V/ H/S"" is none of these things (although, as a woman I found ""some""parts to be ""laughable"" but I think that's all part of the fun here). This movie has technique, style and creepy, mysterious stories wrapped up nicely like sushi! If you're like me, you are bored of what horror movies, ones that take themselves seriously, have become.

They even had a short sequence that was getting a bit scary - there were potential there. But then they instantly destroyed it all. FFS, this was a good student film, but not ready for anything else.

196,Malteser999,The genre had FINALLY revived itself!!,7,22 July 2016,"Ever since The Blair Witch Project, the genre had basically became a gimmick of it's own. Movies like Quarantine had almost no purpose of using the style aside from simply being a cash-grab remake of another better horror movie, REC. Thankfully, these creative director/s, had proved us wrong that the gimmick can be put to good use. In fact, this is by far one of the scariest horror films of 2012 next to Sinister and the under appreciated, The Pact.I'll start off with the entire premise first. A bunch of guys were making money off tapes about them trying to flash women's privates. Then, for some apparent reason, had to trespass a house to find the VHS tape they needed. Yet, that's when the entire movie plays out.We were only shown 5 tapes throughout the film (kind of weird how most are filmed in HD). I'll rate the best are the first and the last, while the worst will be the 2nd. Now, this is the best opportunity when I can say how much the film outdone itself.Despite the unrealistic high quality film, the first VHS managed to make me feel if I was a little boy watching Poltergeist alone at night. Hugging my pillow as tight as I could was something I would never do, especially horror. Really wished the actress portraying the ""entity"" really won some sort of an award cause she deserved it. Unlike my friends, I wasn't easily scared from most horror. But when I do, I would ended up being the only one praising during the credits.The last tape was very different in terms of their scare tactics. Probably because of a great job from the visual effects team utilizing CG in the best way possible. To be honest, I wasn't terrified but experiencing a thrill roller coaster ride near the end.As much as I like what I've seen, there are some issues as well. Like I said I disliked the 2nd VHS and here's why. There is some potential this could've been a damn good stalker short film. Sadly, this is the most boring of them all due to stupid characters. Not complaining about their performance, however it's what they do isn't unsettling or disturbing in some way or another. Putting someone's toothbrush in a toilet? Really? What are you, 5?I also haven't mention about how can I not connect all the dots of this movie. Sure when things you don't seemed to understand can drive you to discomfort. But if it does affect the plot, that's not a good sign.That's pretty much my review on VHS. Is it a masterpiece? No. Did it changed the horror genre history? Not really. Found footage style film making had been around since 1999. Is it worth your time? If you're a fan, check it out on Netflix.",V-H-S
197,hasserbond,"V/H/S 2 is uneven; it may have inventive and clever concepts, but also is constantly uncompromising, and relies too often on grotesque shock value.",4,26 January 2014,"Like many anthologies, V/H/S 2 is uneven. It has many inventive concepts and gimmicks that are creative for it's popular genre, and does have a few unsettling spooks. On the contrary, it is darkly uncompromising and relies too much on discomfortingly grotesque shock value. I would just rent it or only watch the better two of its four short films. If you aren't into horror or gore, this is DEFINITELY not the movie for you. The story: The plot line for this found-footage anthology horror flick is mostly the same as its predecessor. Two private investigators go looking for a missing college student and wind up in his seemingly empty house. That is except for a bright room filled with multiple fuzzy TV's and V/H/S tapes. Filming their search, one of the crew decides to scale the house while the other watches the mysterious tapes. Let's just say that that these ain't any Disney tales. After each tape, strange things begin to increase around and to the investigators...will they uncover the truth, or more importantly, live till the end of their film? The good: V/H/S 2 has some awesome concepts and ideas for its ""hand-held"" segments, and some really clever details that did surprise me. In a world of endless Paranormal Activity sequels, the crew here have successfully found their own niche with the style, and pull off many of their unique ideas quite well. It's hard talking about the film broadly due to its basically five separate stories, but I'll still try. Without saying much the shorts about the bionic eye and Go-Pro wearing mountain biker had the neatest moments. The second one also had some funny moments of black humor and I really the path it choose to take and the twist it added as well. The ""Safe Haven"" segment while horrifically violent and over exaggerated, has a great exposition and tension filled set up that gets as close to a traditionally shot film as possible. The fourth and final segment had a funny beginning and a cool POV for most of it. I can't say much about the actors, they are all fine and do serviceable work. There are a few frightening moments in the film, mostly jump scares, but it has more spooky and unsettling images and thats a credit to the often wise execution of the shorts. Some of the gory effects are campily enjoyable, but they do become overwhelming as the film progresses. The bad: A problem I had with the film is that while it has some great ideas, it doesn't have any satisfying payoffs to fasten the bow on them and usually ends on a hopeless and ambiguous note. This also goes along with the films immensely morbid tone and content that really did leave me unhinged. I understand why they have the bloody effects, but after a while when they try to up the ante, especially in the third segment, it just becomes repetitive and actually overwhelmingly gory. Story-wise, the first has a promising setup, makes some interestingly creepy choices, but ends abruptly and seems too rushed as well as the second and last segments. The third segment has another great start and has ominous foreshadowing that made me uneasy, but it bit off more than it could chew. It tried to shock the audience by using an overload of abhorrent imagery and and bloody carnage. It got too carried away with itself and also had a bizarre and again weakly conceived conclusion. The fourth film was a bit choppy, escalated very quickly, and was to confusingly shot to fully follow. It had a nice reliance on sound and lighting, but still was too frantic to comprehend towards its ending. My take: V/H/S 2 has its highlights and moments that will make you smirk, but it is overall a too brutal and coldly unresolved to be completely enjoyable. It actually made me slightly unnerved afterwards, but not as much from being scared as being disgusted. There is a larger fanbase for the film's macabre and shocking nature, but I guess it didn't all appeal to me.",V-H-S

199,mathshop2,Sadly Disappointed,3,6 October 2012,"With everything I had been hearing about this movie I was very excited to see it. I was so looking forward to it that I waited about a year until it was released to theaters and paid 13 dollars for it.I wasn't expecting it to be life changing but I did think out of all the segments I would see at least one unique take on horror. However, I was sadly disappointed. Not only was there nothing new or scary in this movie, it was laughable and boring.Tape 56- the main story which framed all the others and my favorite. The writing and acting felt natural and was engaging. It quickly turned into REC but I was still entertained the entire time which is more than I can say about the others.Amateur Night- The creature effects were well done but the acting (especially the creepy girl) was way over the top. It was like watching caricatures and went on for longer than needed.2nd Honeymoon- The character's were completely unlikeable so it was very hard to care about what happened to them. The ending was ridiculous. I expected more out of Ti West because House of the Devil was so good but after watching this and The Innkeepers sadly I think HOD was a fluke. The girl knocking on the door and using a mask was very similar to The Strangers, which was much better.Tuesday the 17th- It was like watching a student film project where the director got all his friends to be in it. Eli Roth's Cabin Fever had more to say about the kids in the woods genre than this scrambled mess did. What was the point? The sick thing that happened to Emily when she was younger- the web chat was it was done was admittedly interesting. Unfortunately, the plot was not. Even Paranormal Activity was more entertaining than this.10/31/98- For a movie called VHS I was surprised that only one took place when VHSs were actually used. I'm a big fan of the haunted house genre but this did absolutely nothing interesting with it. It wasn't possible for me to suspend my disbelief enough to accept some of the choices the character's made. Reminded me a lot of House of the Devil.The only reason it gets 3 stars is because I've been unlucky enough to see even worse. Save your time and money.

OK, I've read many reviews which spit on this title, and just because of that I want to give a shot and explain why you should watch this movie.As it's described into the ""storyline"", this movies is created by group of few different stories, every story is different and for its own. So, what really amazed and scared me in this movie was exactly the first story. It a perfect combination for horror and it was really really scary. I haven't seen so scary moments in a movie for years. Other stories weren't so scary for me but anyway I watch the whole movie.I really recommend this movie to everyone who want good horror, and definitely, at least give a shot for the first 30 minutes of the movie (and the first story/tape)8/10 for the whole movie, just because the first part was amazing",V-H-S

The anthology's link material (some guys on a $ errand to retrieve a VHS tape) is the weakest, but all the various clips/sequences on 'the tape' are remarkable in their own ways. Best of the 'hand held cameras' genre, lots of PRACTICAL FX in a variety of 'found cam' stories.We've got Vampires, Ghosts, Haunted Houses,and things best not described all presented completely believable. When I was in my late teens I had a 6mm camera hand-me-down and made use of it. I quickly realized after viewing developed films I'd made, what my limitations were. This has been taken to heart by contributors to this film.. They realize what their resulting footage looks like and have directed their cameras,each in their own style, all VERY effective.. to record accordingly. The results are gripping and effective!

203,darksideofthespoon-622-36121,suspension of disbelief,8,31 August 2012,"I can understand if you do not like the so-called 'found footage' films, for example; Blair Witch and Cloverfield. I must admit, some of them work, some of them don't. Cloverfield worked for me, but only on the big screen in a cinema. Blair Witch worked for me, but only on a small PC monitor. Some things work better depending on the way you view these things, but also, what works with one person, will not work with another, everybody is different.With that out of the way, let me honestly try to convince you that my small review on this film is mainly based on its merits, and not just what I enjoy personally.I think the credit is due to the effort that went behind making this film, because even though each of the video tapes the guys find and watch are very strange and hard to swallow, they have genuinely tried hard to convey a sense of realism. But it also helps if the viewer made a little effort, and suspended your disbelief in order to get into the film. Some people can do this easier than others. If your a horror fan, this will entertain at the very least. Each of the five found tapes start off innocently enough like home movies, but each one reveals shocking footage of something strange or unravels into a horrifying ordeal. It reminded me of 'Tales of the unexpected' or 'The Twilight Zone' but with the use of a hand-held camera instead.Again, it'll either work for you or it wont. But the makers of this film tried hard and kudos to them. The effects were great, the acting was as expected, just as in any 'found footage', if its going to convey realism, its NOT going to have Oscar worthy acting, don't forget these are meant to be 'real' people. And the stories behind each tape were all entertaining.In the end then, before you watch it, heres some top tips; Turn the lights out. Keep telling yourself that what you are watching is 'real'.

But I would have liked it more if they created a story where a reporter would have used the footage to explore and then reach a climax. This just is to incoherent, not that much flow from tape to tape.. Also I lost the time line, left me rather confused.Maybe I like it bit more in Hollywood style, but anyway.. that's how I see it.

It's one of the worst ""found footage"" films ever made because of the way it's filmed. They over use the shaky cam I am sure thinking it adds realism. The only thing it adds is an incomprehensible viewing experience. Avoid this movie at all costs. This has been done much better many times. I realize that's not saying much since this one is the absolute bottom of the cesspool. Horror? Hardly. It's so choppy and poorly filmed that no one in our crowd even cared what was happening. This would be terrible even for a fan film. The amazing thing is that the makers HAD to have screened this and said to themselves, ""Yes this is good!"". They may have had no talent for film making whatsoever. Their skills at self delusion are truly astounding however. I had no problem with the actors/acting, what little of it you can actually see. I would guess that at least HALF of the running time of this movie is take up by static, incomprehensible images and flashing strobe like effects. Imagine how enjoyable it would be to sit through that for an hour or more. Acting was fine. Directing and virtually everything else was complete garbage. STAY AWAY!",V-H-S
206,MannyTheMovieMan,Somewhat successful anthology,7,25 December 2012,"A more inventive than-usual take on the found footage genre is admirable if not all together perfect. The anthology offers a handful of horror shorts contained in a wrap around story involving a search for a VHS cassette in a creaky home. Though some are better than others, the films all contain some strong horror themes with the exception of the confusing, sloppy aforementioned wrap around which seems rushed and non-sensical. The idea of setting the tone that the films are all on VHS and being viewed that way is an interesting one but one can't help but be distracted with the fact that these films seem to take place in a more modern DVD era (not to mention webcams and glasses video lenses) What would they be doing in a video cassette format? the only exception to this is the final segment which takes place in 1998...and is incidentally the best of the bunch. The real footage phenomena is one that often gets tiring and eye-roll inducing but I give kudos to these filmmakers for trying to freshen up this sub-genre. Though not the triumph most expected it is definitely worth a look.",V-H-S
207,curt_doolittle,Excellent work,8,26 June 2013,"Frankly I don't understand some of the negative reviews. Each of the shorts was solid, well executed, free of predictability and morally loaded, as all good horror is and should be. I can easily watch it again and enjoy the second viewing as much as the first.I can understand why it might be boring for some, given that the entire movie is quite long, and breaks the three act model - so the casual viewer is stuck looking for a climax that doesn't arrive. (The Heavy Metal movie suffered from this problem too.) But wanting that simplicity is looking for something in this movie that the producer didn't put there. It is what it is. It's a meaty anthology. And if they don't put that kind of meat together, and work with the three act model, the viewer is left feeling lacking.VHS stands as a solid piece of work in a genre that needs solid work. As an anthology it's a tome of the Year's Best Horror, not a three act play. And having set out to make that anthology, the producer achieves exactly what he intends to. And it's worth watching. But it's not standard fare for the comic book crowd.",V-H-S
208,nicholasmoulaison,great,7,9 August 2012,"There's a lot of found footage type movies coming out, no plot, no original ideas and nothing to contribute to the genre but a couple of cheap scares. Now this movie heads in a different direction by giving original ideas that keep you interested along with a kind of story line. Low budget movie but I have to say they did great with the effects except for one of the tapes. As for the movie itself I have to give it a 7/10. Interesting ideas at work. I rated this movie 7 simply because of the ideas and what they did with the budget. Another note I'd like to add is for all the people complaining about the shaky camera. It is a found footage horror movie, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have a super still hand as they are being chased by a murderer.",V-H-S
209,KillahKitty,Pretty good for the Found Footage genre....but less is more.,6,6 August 2013,"OK ... well, I am in love with the found footage/mockumentary horror genre, but as many others will attest too - the genre is littered with some really horrible, abysmal films. You really have to work to find a good, enjoyable film in this genre.V/H/S's story is tied together by a gang/group of thugs recording themselves breaking into a house to locate a video tape they have been paid to steal. Their viewing of these tapes found in this house is the pathway into our viewing of the individual stories. This footage itself binds together the mini-stories, and features both at the start and end of the film, with short interludes in-between.Let's start with the positives. Budget is not a prerequisite to a good 'FF' film; (in fact films like Blair Witch and the PA series actually use a small budget/little FX to their advantage). V/H/S actually employ some pretty good effects in some of their 'stories' - particularly the paranormal ones - which makes it feel more genuine. The acting is pretty good as well (again, especially for the genre). I'm not sure how scripted this was, but most of the dialogue in the story lines have a realistic flow, and feels natural. They used different directors for each of the individual story too - this was a good decision, as each of the tapes/stories have a different style...which is exactly what you would expect to see from home movies filmed by different people.My criticism lies mainly with how much they tried to do. One of the biggest draws of this genre, is the fear created by empathising with the victims/characters. Most of the stories were about 15 minutes in length, and the characters and plots were not as well developed as they could have been. Having fewer, but more developed stories would have the viewer more invested, and thereby installing a greater fear when things start to go 'wrong'. There are 3 story lines out of the 6(?) which stand out above the others. I think they could have really been a bit more mercenary with editing, by losing some of the weaker stories and extending the length of the better ones. The 'binding' story line of the thugs who break into the house (as I mentioned at the start) was also one of the weaker elements of the film. It is meant to be the backbone of the story - the reason why we are watching the other tapes / story lines - yet it's hard to actually care about this part of the film. In my opinion, there is too much focus on the gang at the start, and too little at the end. I think the film-makers could have done that part of the footage more justice by adding more 'plot', and less mindless vandalism and general 'filler'. It's also a little frustrating that we don't come to really learn the fate of the gang (I hesitate to add anything further so as not to spoil) therefore I ended up feeling a little cheated of a conclusion.For me, V/H/S was pretty good (using the genre in general as a benchmark) - but it still felt lacking, and kinda missed a trick on being a more 'well put together' film. It works well like a book of short stories put together does - combining both elements of slasher and paranormal story lines. However this different style of storytelling is overused in this film, and I think detracts from being better than it could be. It's a shame, as the elements where some other 'ff' films fail miserably, they execute pretty well - but if they edited the stories more carefully, and expanded on the successful elements, this 6 star review would have been an easy 8. Still very much worth a view for what this genre is capable of, and gives faith that the genre has not been exhausted, yet.",V-H-S

If you want that kind of review, read the others.Ill sum this up by NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE!The idea behind this is very interesting and if it was pulled off properly, it could have been a great horror flick, but it wasn't, so its not good. Its OK at best.You got these 4-5 idiotic young guys with their VHS tape recorders taping their ""fun"", then get the idea to blackmail some old guy.Then you got these ""tapes"" that are all filmed with newer technology, yet they're on VHS tapes? Come on. Keep with a g.d. theme, idiots!Besides, with all the completely different stuff thats on these tapes, there's ZERO theme and just bounces from completely different to completely different, yet they want to black mail this guy with 1 particular tape?My mind is spinning by the constant changes. I think all the individuals involved with this film were high as hell, because, again, NOTHING MAKES SENSE!!I will say that of all the different ""tapes"", the one that i liked the best was the last one.Do yourself a favor and don't pay to see this.

211,dhruv-virtualreality,Pathetic excuse for a movie,3,26 August 2014,"I'm not sure whats so exciting about this movie. I've seen people go all head-over-heels over this movie in particular. It came highly recommended and thats why I agreed to watch it. I was expecting some real genuine horror from this one. But most of the time I found myself fast forwarding the movie to cut to ""at least something"" watchable that made any sense. Although, I'll admit that the movie has a couple of scenes that get you at the edge of your seat, for the most part, though, it was disturbingly bad and I had to watch it in 4 separate parts because it always got boring and for me fast with its nudity and painful to watch worthless crap recordings. Moreover, the movie does not even focus on a specific problem or goal that is a must in any movie. Its just some unclear beings, each uniquely appearing in all the 5 or 6 different stories which have nothing to do with each other at all. You may call them ghosts, aliens, mutated beings or just serial killers who have nothing in common apart from a habit of scaring and brutally murdering random people who are featured in this movie. Finally, the last point which goes against it is that it doesn't conclude anything. I mean its not fair to expect it to necessarily conclude anything at the end, especially from this genre, but then again its not something which would leave you pondering over for days considering the director leaves the many possibilities up to your imagination, or a twist in the climax that impresses you or anything that at least forces you to watch it a second time, let alone committing the sin of recommending it to others.Honestly, its just a waste of time. I would never watch the second part even if I got it for free. If you want to watch some cool ""found footage"" genre movies you're better off watching Afflicted (2013), The Dyatlov Pass Incident (2013) or The Tunnel (2011).

My favorite stories or tapes were two. The first one, is the surreal killer that can only be spotted through the lens of a video camera. And the second one, is the couple who goes on a road trip, but the girlfriend ends up being a killer at the end, and kills her boyfriend. Something that really surprised about the tape with the surreal killer, was that the girl managed to trap him. If this killer can only be seen with a camera, I wasn't expecting that he was going to be affected by real traps.",V-H-S
213,im_goode,"A shoddy, overlong tribute to anthology horror movies.",5,21 November 2012,"I'm a big fan of anthology horror movies, and horror in general and I'm willing to accept found footage movies if they're done well enough. That being said this is not done well at all. They use every found footage cliché except night vision. Constant ""glitch cuts"", people carrying the camera around while in danger for no reason, disoriented confusing action sequences. The found footage aspects are the main weakness in this movie, but I'll put that aside for now and review this movie on its other aspects. First of all every character in this movie is terrible. They're either perverted frat boy assholes or completely void of personality. They're not the kind of characters you can't wait to be killed, they're the kind of characters you can't wait to stop listening to. I know there's no time to really flesh out any characters in an anthology, but you can at least give them a personality, these guys are just boring, boring, boring. The plot of most of these shorts are only possible through monumentally stupid decisions from the characters. They never call the call the cops, are constantly tripping while running away (maybe if you dropped the camera...), and the overarching plot characters are the stupidest of them all. There's no bow-tie at the end connecting all these stories, and therefore no need for the very bland overarching story itself. However in a few of the tapes the mystery is strong enough to keep you interested and some of the tension is pretty thrilling, although it never really pays off. I would be more forgiving of the cliché story and characters if it was easier to watch, and I'd be more forgiving of the found footage faux-pas if it had better stories. But this is the worst of both worlds, I would give this a 4/10 but I'm bumping it up 1 for the tits.",V-H-S
214,radulovicka,From a real horror fan,9,19 September 2013,"okay... I know that there are A LOT of bad reviews for this movie. I get why some people may find it to be not very well written or acted or whatever. BUT, I am a long time horror movie watcher/fan, and recently I've watched a lot of horror movies that were either NOT scary enough or just plain boring, with the except of few, of course... I usually hate this kind of horror movies, because they don't make any sense - like, if something really bad starts happening to you (in the real world) while you're filming your vacation trip for example, you probably won't be holding the camera, but rather throw it away and run like hell. But, maybe I'm wrong. The only movie of this type I found to be scary was the Blair Witch project and that was more then ten years ago. Later, after some horror- movie-watching-experience, when I saw i.e. Paranormal Activity, I found it to be ridiculous. So, almost every movie with this kind of premise (with the exception of REC)I found to be ridiculous and unconvincing. HOWEVER, this one proved to be a real gem for me. And believe me, I have high standards. Like, I watch Tarkovsky and stuff. So, why did I like it? To me, it wasn't boring at all. It has a general story - couple of guys go searching for some video tapes and find bunch of VHS with some really crazy s**t on them. For me, director found an elegant way to incorporate this kind of premise into a convincing movie. Some of the elements are sci-fi, there are gory scenes, there's suspension, but human behavior of the actors in this movie, or rather in these VHS movies was logical and believable. To me. There are some totally unexpected and freaky stories. This movie is like a gallery of different horror genres all elegantly wrapped up into one bigger movie with a premise that actually makes sense. And what was most entertaining about this movie is that you get a lot of different short movies in one, so it was very dynamic, I was waiting to see what the next story will be, I tried to make connections between the stories, I tried to get the ""bigger picture"", I was amused and after all that, when I went to bed - I had a nightmare! And that almost NEVER happens after watching a horror flick. Don't expect this to be stunning as The Exorcist or as dumb as Paranormal Activity. It's not even in the middle, it's a twist on the genre that can hardly be remade, even though it's not a masterpiece. But, do watch it, it's worth the time, and hopefully you won't sleep very well after ;)",V-H-S
215,lukejbarnett2002,V/H/S: Must see horror film! Brilliant!,8,7 October 2012,"This is an anthology horror film. This film has so much creative energy, so much style, wit, and entertainment value. what makes this film so good is the creative ways of filming and executing the different stories. every story is different but also works with all the other stories in terms of style, feel, and type. this film is unique, i've never seen a film like it. it has such an immediate feel to it given it's documentary, hand held videotaped onto VHS tape format. also, this format gives it a really realistic effect. also, this is a mysterious film, not everything is explained and thus this gives plot elements mysterious feels. This movie has it all. it has a creature, a serial killer, and a haunted house. it has a weird, unique feel to it. all the stories are quite varied, so you're always thoroughly engrossed. It's so compulsively watchable and intriguing because of the realistic feel of it due to it's documentary, hand held camera format, and point of view perspective. it's like watching a snuff film, it's like these things that you are watching really happened and that's why this film is so compulsively watchable and alluring. it's also vouyueristic because of the first person style, recored on a camcorder, for private home movie viewing style of it. The acting is quite good for the most part and all the characters were likable to me except in the last story, which is a really important thing in a film. This movie seemed to be made just for me in that it has such a great horror film feel to it, and this old school '80s horror film feel. and the one with the kids in the woods has a scene in it in a car where a guy is video taping a woman's boobs in a car, that scene gave me a strong reminder feeling of old Friday the 13th movies. after i watched this film i thought of what scene and what Friday the 13th movie which has that scene that that scene reminded me of. it's the scene in the car in Friday the 13th the final chapter, in which Jim and Teddy are in a car looking at Teddy's computer. oh, and the outdoor, woodsy, feel of the car scene in VHS reminded me of that Friday the 13th the final chapter scene. this story turns out being a Friday the 13th style story and i know it's supposed to be an homage to the old Friday the 13th movies because of the plot elements and the name of the story which is something like tuesday the 17th. oh, and i know this film was made just for me because i love VHS tape movies, and VCRs, and this film looks just like a movie on VHS, with the poor video quality, and even the lines in the screen, and the end credits are awesome with the VHS tape, old fashioned font, and it even has the electronic humming, perfect! you see i grew up in the '80s and so i love all of this stuff. this stuff is nostaglic for me. after i watched VHS i thought about it and the more i thought about it the more impressed i was with it. it's the kind of film that stays with you after you watch it. and(this may seem like a backhanded compliment but)if you were to think about the contents of it you would think that not that much happens in it, but after you watch it, it feels like a lot happened in it. it takes you on an exciting ride, and after the end credits i wanted to get back into the world of this film, i wanted my mind to get back there. this film was so enjoyable to me that near the end i wanted it to continue for a long time. i wish this film never had to end, that's how much i enjoyed it. i give it 8 out of 10 stars because of the poor first half of the last story and some of the unexplained story elements, and the fact that it's not like as good as Raging Bull. But you know what it accomplished just about everything, if not everything it set out to accomplish, and in films that's saying a lot. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! The ""amateur night"" story is my favorite because it really puts you out there on the street and in the club looking for hot women to take home and have sex with. This story is really realistic feeling, i really felt like i was there, due to the documentary and point of view filming style. this story is really entertaining, it's never dull at all, it's thrilling, intense, really sexy, and an all-around blast to watch. it's also funny, one of the guys(the player type guy)is really funny and really likable, i really wanna hang out with him. and the line, ""yeah, garter belts are difficult, especially when they're passed out,"" so funny. oh, and ""make sure she's concsious, statutory,"" that was really funny. i have to mention the superb acting by the main actress in this story. she is a marvel and an enigma, her eyes are truly magical, disarming, and phenomenons. she has such a mysterious air and presence to her which is very intriguing and very alluring. yeah, i'd take her home with me, mostly because of her intriguing personality. also, she is mysterious, i mean really mysterious, which is one of the most amazing things about her. This story is really realistic in how it gives you all the feelings of being in a club. it makes you feel like you feel in a club;(when you are just there to meet women and take one home to have sex with)it makes you feel like anything can happen.",V-H-S

Instead it was more a battle to stay awake, it was that bad. The stories contained could probable have actually been good and scary but 85% of the film is shot in low, low lighting with quick cuts that blur the images to the point of getting a headache. None of it it made any sense what so ever. There is no connection to the different stories you never get to know any of the characters there name or who or what there doing. If you like gore then you might like this there is lots of blood and some cool nudity but gore and nudity do not make a good film.",V-H-S

I just wanted them to move onto the next short. 4/10Amateur Night - In my opinion, the best of the bunch. It's a really entertaining watch and a very strong first segment to follow the weak wrap-around story at the beginning. 8.5/10Second Honeymoon - Quite silly and a bit confusing. Not very interesting. Ti West has done much better work than this before. 4/10Tuesday, The 17th - The characters are quite annoying and so is some of the sound design, but overall this is an entertaining segment. 6/10The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger - A very unique segment as its done through video chat. Kind of a cool idea that doesn't have a great payoff. 5.5/1010/31/98 - Although I had said ""Amateur Night"" is the best segment, this one is by far the most effective as a horror film. This was the only segment that legitimately freaked me out and I actually went back and watched it again. 8.5/10",V-H-S
218,rocknroll_demon,A nice idea that falls flat on its face.,3,27 August 2012,"First of all, credit where credit is due: the concept of this film is pretty good. But like a lot of good ideas being batted about in Movieland these days, the eventual product leaves a lot to be desired.Unforgivable for a horror film is a distinct lack of horror. Indeed, it is only the 'Haunted House' segment that comes anywhere close to generating any real fear. The rest of the movie is just an excuse for gratuitous gore, nudity and cheap shocks. The stories range from the absolute stupid to the just bizarre, with one or two interesting ones thrown in. The characters are all typical one dimensional eye candy, or are morose, perverted, borderline rapist fratboys who are so annoying that when the inevitable death scenes take place, we simply don't give a crap about them.I understand that it is a 'found footage' movie, but the camera-work is so shoddy that it is the only thing that genuinely makes you feel queasy. And if you don't feel ill, you will certainly feel annoyed about halfway through story one.On top of this is a very noticeable lack of payoff at the end. If you have any questions during the movie, please don't expect them to be answered at the end.If you really have nothing better to do then watch this. But if you have something more entertaining, like the laundry, then do that instead.Or just buy a camera and make your own.",V-H-S
219,malcojojo-495-237646,A return to good old horror!,9,6 October 2012,"The visuals are still stuck in my head. Firmly and darkly branded onto my brain like a tattoo under the skin. I feel like an experiment. A test subject that's just been subjected to something very bad. Very wrong. I LOVE IT!We have a collection of stories here. An all ""cinema verité"" style anthology, so if you get sick from shakes, avoid this one or take your Dramamine before seeing it. There's a whole lotta shaking' going' on.We have a classic set up. A group of thugs get hired to go snag a VHS tape from an old man's house. How many tapes? Just one. One, small VHS tape from an old man. How hard can that be? Difficult when there are many to choose from. Which is the right one? Better watch some...and check 'em out.Five...was it five? Stories. The stories roll and we slip from ""watching"" various tapes to seeing what our thug buddies are up to in the old man's place. I'm a sucker for this setup when done correctly and V/H/S nails it. The last film I saw that did this brilliantly was the GLORIOUS Trick R Treat.No, I'm not going to ruin things by going into details. That would be telling.Suffice it to say that the weakest two shorts in the V/H/S assault are still grand and thought provoking works of creepy goodness. Shocking, twisted, chilling and visually delicious - this is a fun movie that gets a lot of things right for sure.There are downsides. I should reiterate that this is shot like it was shot on hand held, VHS cams. Small and twitchy. The jerking motion and shakes are rough at times, but it added to the realism. Another thing of note is a strange mix of empowering females and exploiting them. It wasn't bad, but it was noticeable and sometimes...distracting. (At times, in a good way...wink wink, nudge nudge) I did find myself thinking, ""Why did she just take her top off there. Kinda odd,"" a few times, but I got over it when all hell broke loose yet again. They got a LOT right in this film. Story was still the main focus. They didn't get too wrapped up in the ""See what we're doing? They're tapes. VHS tapes. We're watching them, see?!"" gimmick. They came at this film with great material FIRST, then executed - so to speak. :) They also got the ""person shooting with camera"" right. Things were not framed perfectly. Things moved like people shooting home movies. And most importantly, the actors were able to pull off the complex job of acting like they are not acting in all but one case of note. Pretty impressive. I loved this film.",V-H-S

221,kaylesrichards,Pointless and disappointing,2,31 July 2019,"I am a complete horror fan and I'm actually usually relatively easy to please, but I thought this was unfortunately terrible. The guys that break into a house to steal a VHS tape have nothing to do with the 5 found footage movies we see . Nothing ties them together and the movie just ends with nothing explained. All the individual segments are dull and drawn out except the 4th in my opinion...So much pointless ""build up"" if that's what you call it just drags the movie out, and by the time a character dies I just don't care because im bored and none of them are particularly likeable. For this reason it wasn't scary at all. There is so much swearing, so many of the characters are just childish idiots who say the F word every 10 seconds and act like jackasses and cackle and want boobs and I just want them to die anyway. Slow pointless build up.. Why do I need to see you brush mud off your camera lens? Why was that relevant? Why so much swearing? Why are all the characters juvenile delinquents? Why do I need to watch you debate having sex on camera in real time? I don't understand the point to this film at all except to show some gore and some creepy scenes but as nothing was coherent it just felt so pointless. Sorry, I would definitely NOT recommend it. I know it's a totally type of film but I enjoyed sinister the way the main characters became part of the movie and their fate was linked to the videos . Something interesting like that. But a why are people saying this is clever ?",V-H-S
222,pap9,"Great idea, great stories but.. the bond is missing!",7,1 November 2012,"I am always skeptical about horrors that try to be as real as it is possible and yet still look as fake as God merciful only knows. I but got a hunch that maybe this will be something different and fresh. Something not like 'Paranormal Activity' which for some reason is stealing all the credit (regarding modern horrors) whereas it's only as scary as taking a dump with no light in the toilet. The movie is (spoiler free, no worries) about some guys visiting some place with lots of VHS tapes and they decide to check them. We switch between this 'main story' (about guys watching VHS tapes) and stories that are on the tapes in a fashion like: main story->VHS->main story->VHS... To be clear, we don't switch mid-stories during VHS tapes. Stories themselves are great in my humble opinion. They are exactly how all this 'paranormal-kind' movies should look like. We get to see some real nasty scenes, some ACTUAL paranormal stuff that can be scary (I personally wasn't scared at all while watching either Paranormal series or this movie), if you were scared only a little bit while watching Paranormal series you will be scared pooless while watching this flick. It's like a real horror movie back to its roots. Overall quality of the segments/tapes is quite good if not very good. Shaky camera is a must nowadays but it's not as painfully to watch as in other movies. You don't get the feeling that the camera operator is shaking it more than he should, everything is finely moderate in here and not forced. Acting, voice, sound quality is very good, static effect from VHS tapes is not fake and gay..I mean fake and huge. IT LOOKS REAL NOT OVEREXAGERTED! That is a big plus for this movie. Each tape shows completely different story not connected by anything. Also those stories have no connection with the main story (dudes watching tapes in a house) too. And here is where it get a little bit tricky while rating this movie. Single stories are great, but the overall movie consists of multiple stories and tries to bond them by this main story arc. This the only thing that seems forced, it looks like they made those short horror stories and then they wanted to connect them somehow and it is SO MUCH not working for the whole movie. Think of 'Four Rooms' it was a similar idea, we have 4 rooms 4 different stories, directors, writers, actors. But all of them have something that bonds them with each other. It's Ted (the bellhop boy) and the hotel and it works for those stories. Here we have 5 stories (6 if you count the main story) and their only connection is that they are recorded on VHS tapes and stored in one house. It's not enough movie... not enough. BUT STILL! a good try. Especially that the producers tried to do something different. I'm no big ass producer but I think that if they would just try to make those stories completely separate and scrap the main story, then it would be much better. If you can't think of a great bond, linkage between them then just make them like a real anthology that just represents some stories. I think it would have scored more warmly appeal that way. However I was entertained when I was watching the flick and I recommend it to every horror fan. For me the stories on tapes were what make this movie great, it really shows how all those modern 'quasi-documental' horrors should be made- ""It's a horror movie, make it a little bit scary, moving doors and objects won't scare any1 now!"" It won't scare you but it's a nice fresh air in the genre.",V-H-S

Some found footage films pull it off quite nicely... ""V/H/S"" however, was not one of them. Overall, the visuals worked quite well throughout the film(s), but the acting was for lack of better words - uncommitted and dreadful. V/H/S did have its moments though. There were scenes where I was actually rather impressed-although most of the special effects were a bit campy and overzealous. Each segment of the film had their plot holes, sub-par acting, and of course the very common ""shaken camera syndrome"" that makes it found footage. THAT got a little annoying. I watched from start to finish, hoping the film would make some sense-but it didn't. It would've been better had each segment had some little tidbit which tied it to the next and the previous rather than the complete randomness of it all and the deviants which the entire film revolves around.Conclusion: rather disappointed in indie horror's greatest directors with this one. Conceptually, this film was on to something, but a lack of a cohesive story, plot holes, poor acting, the slow start and a cold ending leaves this to be something I wouldn't recommend..unless the viewer had plans on getting stoned or was absolutely bored to death.",V-H-S
225,Zomblified,An honest review.,9,13 September 2012,"First off, I'd like to say that I'm in no way a professional movie critic. In fact, I don't typically submit reviews on IMDb because I don't feel like all movies need like hundreds of reviews from various random people on the internet. However, I would like to say that I am not only a huge fan of movies, I'm also a huge fan of horror films. I watch tons of horror films. I'm really liking the indie stuff that's been coming out recently since all Hollywood seems to be able to do is make shitty remakes. I decided I wanted to review this movie because there seems like the reception is divided down the middle (which is usually the case for a lot of movies). But I don't want to approach it as someone pretending they know how to be a professional critic but instead approach it as a regular dude who likes horror movies. Now, with that being said, here's what I thought of V/H/S.The movie, of course, is recorded in the ""found footage"" method. But what really sold it for me is that unlike movies like Cloverfield where they try to sell the movie as ""found footage"" but you can tell the camera used was still really high quality, V/H/S really felt like a movie recorded with like a mid 90s VHS camcorder which really added a realistic and gritty feel to the movie which I really enjoyed.As far as the various short films, I won't go into much detail. Some were better than others for me, but overall I thought they were all really good and, for the most part, were believable which allowed me to really let myself go and really get into the various scenes.All in all, I can't really think of any flaws. I know a lot of people complain about ""shaky footage"" but pull your head out of your ass, if you were running around with a camcorder and not a tripod, your footage would be shaky too. I mean, if I was being chased by a killer, the last thing I'm gonna worry about is setting up the right camera angle before I get gutted. I would highly recommend this movie to any horror fans.",V-H-S
226,juice2305-966-675788,Big Disappointment as usual,4,6 October 2012,"OK I will keep this short and too the point, I am done with Horror movies for awhile. This is about the forth or fifth Horror movie of the last few years that was so hyped up that I couldn't wait to go see it. And just like the rest of them, I left the theater totally disappointed. I would just like to know what was it about this movie that so many reviewers thought was so good? I read that a couple of people fainted during this movie. Are they for-real???OK it's a combination of 5 short stories, and I have always liked that style ever since the Tales from the Crypt days. Where you get 4 or 5 or maybe even 6 short tales of terror. And even if a couple of them suck, you still might get lucky with the others. And that's exactly the case with this one. I thought the first one and the third one were pretty good. But the second, forth and fifth SUCKED!!!The first one has 3 total jerks who go out drinking at the local Bar, and end up bringing a couple of girls back to their hotel room with nothing but bad intentions on their minds. The problem is, one of the girls they bring back has a serious apatite and they end up wishing they had left her ass back at the bar. But I enjoyed it and was hoping the rest of them would follow suit, but that was not the case at all. Because the next one was so bad it's not even worth mentioning about a young couple apparently on a romantic vacation. It wasn't scary, it wasn't entertaining, it wasn't nothing. I'm like, what was the point of that? And then there's the third one which starts off with 4 crazy teenagers of course, venturing out to the woods of course, where there's a killer waiting of course. Nothing new there, but the way the killer is viewed was excellent. Kind of reminded me of The Predator. This is also the one that has the most gore. Reminded me of Jason Voorhees type killings. I thought this one was also pretty good. My only problem with this one was I thought the two girls in it were so damn cute,I really hated to watch what happens to them.Then the forth one there's this young girl chatting with this guy on Skype. She's telling him that she thinks her place is haunted and asks him to record their conversations so he can see for himself. And from that point, I really don't know what the hell was going on. I'm thinking, maybe i dosed off. Because it didn't make a bit of sense to me. What the hell actually happened? Nothing gets explained and you're just left hanging. SUCKED!!! Then the fifth one was about a so-called haunted house. Give me a break. I've seen many haunted house movies that were way better then that. It had it's moments but not enough for me to give it a positive review.So that's my opinion of V/H/S. The first and third segments were good and could very well be made into full length movies with the right director. But the rest were not worth the price of admission.",V-H-S
227,rogertbop,Will Become a Horror-Classic,7,15 August 2012,"Yes! Finally a refreshing take on the exhausted ""found-footage"" genre. V/H/S was a LOT of fun to watch. Brutal, suspenseful, clever, and most important of all, it felt completely real. I'm going to review each separate story that make up the anthology, rather than reviewing it as a whole movie. It just didn't feel like a ONE whole movie. Amateur Night: The filmmakers made a good decision of starting it off with Amateur Night. The most original of them all, in my opinion. It was absolutely creepy and eerie. The only bad part was that most of the footage showed way too much of the characters freaking out, and not enough of them actually trying to get the hell away from homegirl trying to eat them. 7/10Second Honeymoon: The most boring of the bunch. Had a pretty heart- breaking twist. Much of the suspense only took place when the couple were sleeping. The rest of the footage consisted of redundant dialog. Kinda like: ""there's a girl walking around out there"" .. ""what? there's a girl walking around out there? what's she doing?"" .. ""yeah, that girl walking around out there...looks like she is waiting for a ride."" 3/10Tuesday the 17th: This one took the slasher-teenagers-in-the-woods approach. Fun and violent. But besides the awesome twist, the entire story was forgettable. And the blurriness of the killer was kind of cheesy. 5/10The Strange Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Young: My second favorite. This one was actually scary to watch, frightening almost. Joe Swanberg out-did himself. It had the most clear and natural dialog. Creepy and shocking. The ending had me maniacally laughing to myself. I really couldn't see any faults or things I hated about it. 10/1010/31/98: The best out of all of the others by a LONG shot. My toes were clenched the entire time. Puts all of the Paranomal Activity movies to shame. Obviously, they put the best for last. Nothing more needs to be said. 10/10I couldn't rate Tape 56 because it was the arc of the story. So it really didn't have a ""middle"" part. It consisted of a beginning and an end, which I do not consider an actual story.Overall score: 7/10",V-H-S
228,buddah-ess,Complete Horror: Something Unique,7,2 August 2013,"V/H/S is the complete collection. It has everything a fan of the horror genre appreciates. The anthology narrative structure dissolves the need for plot restrictions and enables what seems like an endless possibility of story telling. Though the plot of the film is fairly thin, it is overall an irrelevant factor due to the various short films included. Each becoming more bizarre and wonderfully sickening than the last. Stylistically, V/H/S is a POV hand held that has become popular in recent years. What separates this from others of this style is its focus around the recorded and collective obsession. I will not explain further due to a possibility of any slight spoilers (and with a film such as this it is vital not to spoil anything). This film is creepy, shocking, stylish, imaginative, and it is able to cover a huge spectrum of the horror genre with it's narrative approach.

Many themes, symbols, and classic horror tales are played out unapologetically, leaving an indulgent audience participation which leaves horror lovers really satisfied with the content. The first storyline references The Lost Boys; the humour and delivery of acting left me laughing, scared, grossed out and really routing for the characters. The awkwardness of the scene culminating a downright thrilling and pleasing ending leaves this opening as the stand-out of the entire run. The humour and parodic nature of Eli Roth and the gross out of Itchi The Killer can be felt throughout. It really is an encompassing relay of horror classics with a modern portrayal. It is unfulfilled in explanation which is a tone throughout the movie but I think the whole point is that this is footage being watched in the film also, we are not meant to know the entire story as it is fundamentally a POV narration. I think its a movie to sit back, watch and enjoy without questioning too much the deeper meaning.",V-H-S
230,mikedunlap45,My review of V/H/S. CALLING ALL HORROR FANS!,9,9 January 2013,"First off let me say that I watch horror films constantly, I freaking LOVE IT! I've seen em all from the scariest ghost movies and scariest exorcism movies to the scariest ones in general and I am in no way trying to say this is the best however its a damn good one, well worth a watch for most horror fans or someone who just likes a good scare every now and again. With all that being said I can say with good promise that this one delivers the chills and a nice well thought out story in each segment. The movie starts off with some crooked guys causing havoc and talking about starting up a certain ""industry"" through video. So blah blah blah they end up in an old mans house, it is there they discover a bunch of other VHS tapes of a bunch of horrifying stuff. the movie plays out with 5 different tapes being played throughout the movie and after each is done it goes right back to the main story at hand which of course is the tale of the crooked guys looking for a certain tape. Each tape tells a terrifying story, all of them extremely scary as hell! also very well thought in story for each one, each tape has an interesting yet very scary/twisted story with a nice twist at the end of each one that kinda makes you go ""huhhh, so that's what that's all about"" but each with a satisfying scare and a haunting feeling left over. The movie is directed by 8 different people including the talented scare master ti west(new and not the best but he sure knows how to make stuff pop out at ya quite well) along with the others this movie ended up quite nice, if you'r looking for a really good/haunting horror film or if you just wanna cuddle up with the girlfriend or wife its a great film that delivers what it was going for. Definitely check it out its on netflix now!",V-H-S

But at the very least, it's trying something new. The guys trashing the house and finding the tapes was well done.For my money, the best story was the one with the weird and clingy girl who gets stranger as the night goes on.

It starts with one storyline if you can call it that, then goes to another story, then another, its all done through a cam, so very shaky and half of the story lines don't make sense anyway, its utter rubbish, don't waste your time, their are far better horror films with an actual storyline out there to watch this is just a wast of a few hours out of your life.

In the meantime, the movie shows you a couple of independent, short stories, recorded with a handy cam. If movies like Paranormal Activity, REC, etc. are really scary to you, then VHS will really scare you. Otherwise, don't watch it... Don't get me wrong, some of the short stories were a bit frightening, but personally I don't like movies that are filmed like this. Also, some of the characters were VERY annoying. At a certain point, I really wanted some of them to die, because of the bad acting.So like I said, if you liked REC and PA, you are going to love this one.

240,romerofan,"Overrated, Over-Hyped and Over-the-Top",5,14 September 2012,"Once again a horror movie emerges that is presumably a horror-fan's dream come true. As with ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Insidious"" and others of their ilk, audiences are being told by obviously easily-frightened critics that this is the real deal; a terrifying roller-coaster ride of honest-to-God nightmare-inducing horror. That would be a nice blurb if it rang true for this film and not too far off from adjectives already afforded this movie from reviewers who obviously thought V/H/S is truly something special.I didn't. In fact, V/H/S is about as instantly forgettable as a made-for Sci-Fi Channel movie.You already know the set-up; five stories emerge from a dead man's room full of monitors. Each story seems to salute a particular horror theme, and while the five stories are promising at the outset, other than the first story, these mini-movies fall way short of delivering what you hoped they were going to, or were certainly capable of doing. In fact, as separate entries, the stories are more like 'fragments' of more complete films, and some of these with an abrupt ending, actually come off as a little movie that has run out of ideas and just ends, which caused confusion and frustration for me.Now, if you want graphic gore, nudity, sexual content and wall-to-wall profanity, then you'll like this. If you want visceral terror, you will get just a few brief shots. if you want scares, this film has virtually none. Do some of the stories resonate in your mind after viewing? Not for me. When the film was over, I could only sigh and shake my head that a strong cast and promising ideas are wasted within scripts that just don't come together, or fell flat at the pay-off point. Basically this is yet another American sad excuse for a horror movie.Sadder still, is that some truly terrifying recent horror films like ""The Children"" and ""Babysitter Wanted"" are ignored, while ""V/H/S"" is gaining the kind of attention and acclaim; unheard of since ""The Exorcist"", which it doesn't even come close to.",V-H-S

No overall plot. Senseless. Nothing is explained and nothing is given to help reason your own explanations. I guess fear is expressed differently in each of us, but I can't see how anyone would find this scary.I sat through the entire movie hoping that it would get better...no such luck.

242,incognito4884,It was okay,5,16 September 2012,"I haven't really watched many found-footage films so I wasn't sure what the format would be like for this movie. It is basically a group of 5 different stories compiled to make one movie. I don't watch horror films very often because, I'll admit, I scare easily. When the movie was over I did feel thoroughly creeped out, which is a good sign that VHS did its job.I actually liked the POV filming style; the shaking and quick movements didn't bother me but I can see why it would annoy others.I do have a few complaints... Almost every single female in the movie exposes her breasts for one reason or another. Was that really necessary? As a female viewer, I became very annoyed with this by the 3rd pair of breasts needlessly shown. I get that females aren't the target audience, but seriously?The main story, the guys trying to find a film, didn't really tie the other stories together...so there was no plot or anything substantial holding the film together. It ends up being just a compilation of creepy stories; because of this, VHS just ends abruptly with no real explanation. ******* I gave it 5 stars mostly because it creeped me out, but also because it was interesting and kept me watching.Overall, VHS is an okay movie. If you don't like shaky footage or movies without a real plot, just stay away from this one. If you enjoy movies like Paranormal Activity then you will probably like this too.",V-H-S
243,brijs82-458-528496,Too much,6,27 August 2012,"What we have in V/H/S are a bunch of prolonged horror moments that in 
 usual cases would be the climax to any average horror movie. The movie 
 manages to throw 5 of these 'money shots' at the viewer without the 
 need to tell any real story, build any of the characters or introduce 
 their personality's to the audience. Whether this is a stroke of genius 
 originality or just laziness is the question.
 
 You'd be forgiven for thinking that V/H/S is the result a brain 
 storming session where five writers pitched five stories, with one 
 'Eureka' moment of making a movie of the ending of all five. What they 
 seemingly failed to spend any real time on though was the glue to bind 
 the five stories together. It is completely irrelevant, in fact I would 
 go as far as to say the movie would be better without it, a ""Here are 
 five tapes that were found, now watch them"" instead.
 
 I have to say I am a fan of 'found footage movies'. To me they achieve 
 the desired effect and can, at times, create some truly chilling 
 moments. This movie does have it's moments but after a while it all 
 gets too much, the 'found footage' angle is somehow lost with the 
 constant change of story. You are never really allowed to reach the 
 same level of suspense as with other films in this genre.

Acting wasn't horrific considering the ages of the actors, that's the same for the dialogue. I just think they took ideas that are very simple but for some reason haven't been totally explored yet and they ran with that, the scene in the ""haunted house"" was pretty unexpected and just kept surprising you.

The ""unsteady""cam videography grates from start to finish and is altogether too contrived. I guess there was an intent amongst the directors to find a new way to make found footage movies interesting again. They failed. The women are either brainless, predatory or exploitative, the male characters are invariably douchebags whom you wouldn't mind seeing murdered in the various gruesome ways portrayed in the movie. This is the crudest, lowest form of audience exploitation I think I've ever seen. The script/""acting"" seems to consist entirely of feminine bleating or male cackling.

SO 8/10 for that short but -3 because it's stuck in a crap movie.The only people who could find value in the other two thirds are those who want mindless gore, despite it being pretty bad quality (at one point in the 3rd VHS the blood looks like raspberry jam instead of actual blood which only made me hungry instead of scared).

I mean, you can see from miles away where the trouble is gonna come from. On the good side, the main actress' performance is really scary and convincing.""Second Honeymoon"": a little boring in the first part, when it seems to go nowhere. And I think it's unfair when key events are narrated by the characters instead of happening under the viewer's eyes. But the ending succeed in being shocking and perfectly logical at the same time.""Tuesday the 17th"": in my opinion, the weakest one. It's the old ""horny students stalked in the woods by something very bad"" cliché with some not so clear twists. Let's say that the supernatural element comes out of the blue with no preparation or explanations. Still, there are good ideas and a bit of dark humor.""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"": telling a story through the videochats between the main characters is a very original approach, and the script is diabolically smart in misleading the viewer. For me, the best one.""10/31/98"": the story itself is nothing special, but the short offers one of the most creepy and visionary haunted houses I've ever seen in a movie.All in all, a good horror flick which found footage fans will surely appreciate.",V-H-S

This particular exercise isn't paying enough so they somehow stumble across a deal to find a VHS in some random house. Nobody knows a lot about it, but they go anyway and the movie kicks off from here.. Once at the house they begin by finding a dead guy (presumably the owner of the house), but un phased by this they begin to watch a series of movies that are laying about.. There's 5 movies that are watched.. Let me tell you 2 out of the 5 movies are a little bit scary and had me interested, but overall they are really poorly done, have no bearing on the actual movie (nothing seems to anyway as there isn't a story line), and leave you asking more and more questions as they continue to unfold. I won't go too far into the details of the movies but i will say they are done awfully and make no sense. The only reason i continued to watch is i thought somewhere, somehow this movie was going to intertwine the main story with the movies we were watching. I was left disappointed. Not once do they even have anything to do with each other. The main story even finishes before the last movie is played so we are basically watching the last movie with it leading no where.My MAIN questions and believe me i had many were:Whats the deal with the honeymoon movie, what the hell happens for it to end like that? Offer us some explanation, please!How are we expected to believe the girl was able to booby trap the woods in the 3rd one without being killed originally by that computer generated thing?What is the deal with the movie that involves an internet chat session, a doctor, ghosts? and what seems to be an alien being removed from the stomach of his girlfriend who then somehow lives to fight another day after that trauma her body went through?And the zombie? Why? How? ...And was it necessary?I'm a big horror movie fan and i'm also a fan of the found footage style when done correctly, but this is a joke.

It is the biggest steaming pile of disjointed crap that I've ever been unfortunate to watch. The 'movie' is basically a few disjointed segments with no creative glue holding them together. A group of thieves break into an old man's house to find him dead watching static, they were supposed to steal a VHS tape. The thieves are clearly intelligent enough to take a video recording of all their crimes and this is the main plot in most of the movie. Long story short they find a bunch of tapes and each of them documents people dying in different paranormal circumstances, the characters of the main plot don't even react to what they're watching, they just stick on tape after tape while chilling out beside the dead guy as people from their group disappear. I'd disappear if I had to watch this again. After the 'main characters' (who barely deserve the term as there was no plot development or revelation amongst them) cop it it cuts to more shoddily filmed crap of a group of kids who end up in a real haunted house for Halloween then get accidentally by a train. I have no idea how people could possibly enjoy this, it's a series of uninventive shorts with no solid connection put together by a weak and predictable plot line. The camera-work is so shaky that I thought the producers must have filmed in Haiti during earthquake season and the acting is horribly substandard.

259,mkviTDI,The trailer was terrifying; the movie is terrible,1,29 September 2012,"I am so ticked off about wasting over two hours watching this STUPID film that I am writing this angry review at 5:00 in the morning.(SHORT REVIEW: The film is so disjointed and illogical that you are simply frustrated at the end, not scared. First time I've ever seen the overall arching storyline conclude before the sub-stories conclude, it's that non-sensical!!)The trailer got me really hyped up for this film, as did a solid 80% rating on RT. Frankly, I don't know what is wrong is the critics to give this piece of **** any credibility.The premise starts off intriguing enough; it's ""wraparound story"" of a bunch of petty criminals break into a creepy house with a dead guy in it to steal a certain VHS tape (they don't know which one). So they start viewing some of the tapes and we, the audience, are treated to a front- row show.Some of these tapes viewed are good; my favourite is the last one, 10/31/98, where cool paranormal stuff happens and there's a predictable but satisfying twist. I would be happy if this was a standalone film.Others, like SECOND HONEYMOON, are awful because it's just violent, not scary. When the camera turns on and starts recording in the middle of the night, it's a shock when you realize that the one recording is neither of the couple. But then this mysterious creep pulls out a switchblade, and subsequently jacks $100 from a wallet, all on camera. What the ****?? That's not scary at all. Someone recording themselves doing a break & enter does not classify as ""horror"".Anyway, as a viewer you forgive these stupid plot lines because you keep anticipating that the ""wraparound story"" will eventually conclude, with something connecting these completely unrelated stories. Joke's on you, sucker!The conclusion of the wraparound story — which builds itself up to something very creepy — is disappointing and not scary (***SPOILER AGAIN*** surprise! Dead guy ain't dead...is he a zombie? Demon? No idea, he doesn't actually do anything scary). And WORST OF ALL...it ISN'T the end of the film!!!Inexplicably, a final tape (10/31/98) is played AFTER that wraparound story concludes. It's insulting to the audience how stupid this is, and the only redeeming quality is that 10/31/98 is a decent story.If the film was presented properly as a collection of horror shorts (with proper title cards and all), then it would be a little better. But it's not, and worse, there is an overall arc that is supposed to connect everything together to make you think ""OHHH! That's why! Man, that's scary!!"" but does not.Just awful.Yes, there are a good number of hide-behind-your-buddy scary moments, but there is NOTHING more disappointing than a horror movie that leaves you frustrated and disappointed enough to write a 1-star review on IMDb in the middle of the night.",V-H-S
260,stephenbeaumont1,Not worth it,3,26 September 2012,"To me this movie started off incredibly bland for 30 or so minutes. 1. the first movie was a bit creepy at first but turned to ridiculous by the end. 2. the second one was slow til the climax, but then left a lot of questions that never got answered. 3. speaking of unanswered questions, this one made no sense. 4. your going to hate these characters within a minute, and be happy when they die. then they go back to the guys in the house, and it just has no build up and you will watch it and feel disappointed. 5. this one was a bit unbelievable in the beginning, but it could have been interesting, then it took a turn for the stupid. Overall I was expecting some great point of realization where all these clips start to make sense, or that they would actually find the video they were looking for, but i guess they just wanted you to feel disappointed. sloppy production, had some good potential but did not play on any of its strong points.",V-H-S
261,adamkarz,Creepy but kinda pointless,6,5 October 2012,"Overall pretty creepy, good production value but not entirely original. If you are a big fan of horror movies this is definitely worth your time, but wont change your life. Each vignette was genuinely creepy and had good atmosphere but in the end, it doesn't amount to enough...Each of the vignettes kind of would qualify as the ending of any horror movie, so in essence its like seeing the end of 5 different horror flix...See it on Netflix!!Of the found footage genre of horror I would definitely rank this above the paranormal activity movies. Unlike paranormal activity there were definite moments in this that made me shudder and look around my own apartment...",V-H-S
262,buckyzombie713,A plot less disaster with horribly unlikeable characters,1,15 April 2016,"I'll admit, I didn't finish this movie. I didn't get past the first tape the main characters were watching. If it got better at all, I did not get there to see it.When the movie started, I was already concerned- spending time with these characters who're complete and utter jerks, forcing women to show their tops on camera among other things, was NOT my cup of tea. I had to keep telling myself ""well, they'll get what's coming to them soon, I wanna see them die horribly"". These were just all around unpleasant individuals who's obnoxious actions and dialogue made me hate them more with every passing second.There was also a random sex scene included in that first part. It had no bearing on the plot and was completely and utterly pointless. To make it worse, it included one of the main assholes, so I not only had to deal a pointless sex scene but I had to deal with a pointless sex scene with a character I can't stand. Pass.Things seemed like they might be interesting when the characters got to the house. I was hoping something bad would happen, one of them would die, whatever. I was honestly just hoping something, anything, remotely interesting would happen. The section with the old man and the tapes was very interesting, and held my attention enough to decide to see where that went. The dude put the first tape in and I was excited to get away from this unpleasant bunch and see something with substance.That hope waned quickly. These new characters, wearing ""camera glasses"" to go out and film random girls at a bar, were just as annoying as the first, if not more so. They behaved obnoxiously at the bar and obnoxiously on the ride home.I was sure that this girl was going to kill one of them soon. I could tell she was the entity or antagonist that this section focused on and I couldn't wait to both leave these characters and get something substantial. Instead, first two of the guys consider raping the girl who's passed out (making my hatred for them reach it's absolute peak), before one guy starts having sex with the other girl while camera-glasses dude films it. It was at this point that I realized this film was not written for people like me, or people who cannot stand the main characters- it was written for people who are like the main characters, people who are just as morally lacking. It was written for them to see characters that are like themselves. It was for them to get to see naked people easily, to get to see people just like themselves on screen, and to get to have a chance to focus on cheap ""thrills"" like pointless, un-contextial nudity without having to worry about working their minds to focus on an actual plot.Those people can have this movie, as I am willing to leave it the hell alone.",V-H-S
263,bethtierney5887,"I was happy that someone wanted to bring back anthology, ended up being disappointed",3,2 January 2013,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***My friend and I are huge horror movie nerds. We both watched this movie and agreed it was pretty bad. You know a movie is pretty unimpressive if you watch an anthology movie and forget one of the stories. That can't reflect well on a movie. I give it a 3 out of five because there are some decent scares. Most of the stories have little, if any, plot. There are pretty much all trope stories, a vampire/demon, a haunted house, a murderer, killer in the woods, and alien abduction rape babies. You can find better movies with the same story line, better written, and shot better else where. I love first person POV movies, probably because Blair Witch scared the crap out of me when I was 12, but the fact that these stories are all so cliché makes the entire thing too hard to immerse yourself into. In 1st person POV the actor has to walk a fine line between overacting and skilled acting for the audience to immerse themselves in the film. None, except maybe one or two of the actors, had this balance working for them. There is also a fine line the director walks between a good film and a bad film in 1st person POV and all of the directors are firmly on the bad side of that line. All five stories have a ""twist"" at the end. In one movie this is a great device, in an anthology it's really not. In an anthology there is way too much repetition as it is, to use one device in ALL of the shorts is like beating a dead horse. It's also a mark of bad story telling when the major plot device is a twist and not the story that it's telling. All in all; skip this movie",V-H-S

Call me old-fashioned but his bothers me like hell and makes me upset on behalf of my sex.Regarding the plot I find the sequel much more entertaining. This movie doesn't scare me as much as the sequel does. Actually I was kind of bored. None of the tapes shown were really scary except the last one which takes place in an apparently abandoned house on October 31st.All in all I give it 3 out of 10 because of the creativity.",V-H-S

266,brett-bayne,"Found Footage, Anthology Style!",8,15 December 2012,"Imagine a mix of ""Tales from the Crypt"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" on a third-generation VHS tape, and you've got a pretty good idea of this found-footage shocker. Much (most?) of it is deliberately shot in low-resolution with hand-held cameras — there are even ""tracking problems"" thrown in to make it seem more authentic — and it's an effect that will doubtlessly render the film unwatchable for many. Even so, this is a pretty scary horror movie...I probably shouldn't have watched it immediately before going to bed. It may be the first found-footage anthology movie; there are five stories in all, with a sixth ""framing"" tale that ties them (howsoever tenuously) together. Most of them are at least unsettling, and all are gruesome in one way or another. This is a must for horror fans who like their movies dripping with gore, and who aren't terrified of the ultimate movie menace — the shaky hand-held camera shot.",V-H-S

Very creepy and a great idea that allowed each Director(s) to unleash their creativity in their segments. Looking forward to more from each of them. Some great acting too (some shaky ones too). Helen Rogers, for example, was great (I thought). It was also quite horrifying, to say the least, and perfect for friends to argue amongst themselves once its finished on which segment they thought was the best. If you like horror films or anthology stuff, go see this. I myself am not huge on horror flicks, since most are repetitive and just all around lacking, but VHS felt unique.",V-H-S
268,miguelcardoso36,Someone's Horrifying Collection Is My Golden Obsession,6,19 October 2012,"Let me get this straight, right off the bat: This movie is... EPIC!This is probably the best found-footage action/horror movie I've seen since ever.A group of misfits are told by an unknown person to go steal a VHS tape on an abandoned house. When arriving, they find the house empty. Well... there's an old guy's dead body on a couch with a massive amount of TV's in front of him.The misfits then find an enormous pile of VHS tapes, and, not knowing which one it is, they start to watch them. One... by... one.There are a total of six tapes.Tape 56 (Main Story Arc) - This is the ""wrap-around"" tape.Amateur Night - This story involves sex, demons and blood. LOTS!Second Honeymoon - This story is about a ""couple"" that goes on vacation. The husband gets his throat slit while he's asleep and the movie reveals that his murderer is his ""wifes"" lover (a woman). It involves a lot of violence.Tuesday, the 17th - This story is about a girl that invites her friends to go on a trip with her. What they don't know is that she is luring them to trap the serial killer who killed her previous friends in the woods. (This one is by far the worst, due to bad acting).The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger - Yes, this is the title. This story is filmed on a Skype conversation. A woman (Emily) thinks her house is haunted and complains about a lump in her arm. Her ""boyfriend"", James, tells her it's nothing. While attempting to contact the spirits, she is attacked and left unconscious. Seconds later, James enters her house, (he was supposedly on another state) and talks to the ghosts. While she is still unconscious, he cuts her open and crudely extracts a strange fetus-like thing from her back. With some concern for her well-being, he asks them how many times they are going to need him to remove it before no more grow inside her, and how long the tracking device implanted in her arm will continue to operate. They respond with inaudible whispers, and he breaks her arm and bruises her eye to make it look like she was hit by a car, before noticing that her web cam is still on. He turns it off, and the scene jumps forward to Emily talking to James, with a black eye and her arm in a splint. She tells James how the doctor he recommended (most likely also working with the spirit-children) diagnosed her as having a mild form of schizophrenia, and that it explains everything: that the ghosts were ""all in her head"" and why she doesn't remember ""running in front of a car."" They hang up, and the video cuts to James talking to a different woman—apparently also his girlfriend—who displays a strange bump on her arm.10/31/98 - Chad, Matt, Tyler and Paul (dressed in Halloween costumes as the Unabomber, a pirate, a nanny cam and a marine, respectively) head out to a Halloween party at a stranger's house but soon find the house deserted. They get in through the back and think the house is actually a haunted attraction. The camera in Tyler's bear costume shows things like a woman appearing, then disappearing, in a mirror, and the others laughingly saying things like arms reaching out of the walls in another room. The friends hear loud chanting from the attic and interrupt a group of people seemingly assaulting a bound young woman. They think this is a joke at first but soon realize the truth when the leader assaults the woman violently, strange hands emerge from the walls, and cult members are pulled to the ceiling. The guys run downstairs but one convinces them all to return and rescue the girl, not realizing they are interrupting an exorcism. Just as they save her, more haunting and disturbing paranormal events prevent them from escaping via the front door. They exit through the basement and get into the car, but when they begin to question the woman, she is no longer there. However, she reappears beside the car window. The car starts to move by itself. The friends witness the woman leave into the night and they realize that their car is not only stuck on the train tracks, but the doors are sealed shut, as well. They attempt to break the windows as they see a train approaching. The final video ends as the friends are killed by the oncoming train.Overall, this movie is amazing. I wasn't bored a second. I highly recommend it.9/10",V-H-S
269,whiteleaf_o,Unwatchable,1,14 October 2012,"I have to admit I could barely finish the film. I love found footage films and even when they're not that good I enjoy them. But this one took the genre a little too seriously and in an attempt to appear genuine it spoiled everything for me for one simple reason: the shaky camera was too shaky. I don't usually have a problem with that but this one gave me a headache. In the second story they even shake the camera while the person in front of it just sits and talks. It seemed like a too eager found footage film wanting to appear as real as possible but failing in the attempt since a child wouldn't hold the camera that unsteady. It just mistook the whole let's-make-it-as-real-looking-as-possible with let's-make-it-barely-watchable. I would rather recommend other titles like Grave Encounters, the Tunnel, or Lake Mungo. They're not as famous as Paranormal Activity or Rec but they're just as good and if you like the genre you'll love these. Skip this one, it's not worth the time",V-H-S
270,quidquopro,It hurts,1,9 November 2012,"I watched this ""movie"" because of all the hype. The knuckleheads who ""created"" this monstrosity must have spent all of their Christmas money, which I estimate to be about 300 dollars. It has to be the worst piece of film ever conceived. It is 100 times worse than Blair Witch Project. Any one would have a better time watching ad hoc clips from You Tube. There is no plot, just constant jittery cheap camera shots that could send the watcher into a seizure. Apparently there are several directors who should have taken a different course study while they were able. If you are into self torture than by all means waste your time and money.

271,red-man-ever,The sheer thought of it engraves paranoia.,10,7 December 2012,"V/H/S isn't exactly what you would call a horror flick. I would rather call it more of a terrifying experience. I'm also not very hard to scare at times, but when my heart is beating out of my chest for a near 2 hours you did a good job. This camera based film is so very underrated. I would think it belongs along side the Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch genre maybe even further (no other comparison besides the camera based filming). I am in no way exaggerating either. V/H/S takes several horror based genres and neatly places it into one frightening movie. Although, in some parts it does seem cheesy, but it's so original I can't help but let the movie keep rolling. The scenes were so uncomfortable that I never had a break. By that I mean the movie was scary for the whole entirety of the viewing. That had to have been the first time I have ever seen a film like that in my life especially in the independent industry. This movie doesn't want to make you believe the tapes are real, or ""based on true events"". V/H/S wants to hit home at your worst fears. It wants to make you paranoid.",V-H-S

Now i like boobs as much as the next guy but this film shows them even when it doesn't need to, the structure goes a little like this (spooky - - Boobs - spooky - WTF - Boobs - repeat).secondly i want my movie to come to an end but we don't even get an end, it just sort of finishes, there's a bit of a a story there, but you have no connection to any of the characters, there was one character i liked and that was the winged female ripping hearts out, i felt sorry for her, but for everyone else I was like ""so who's this?"" thirdly the characters are just so thick, there's nobody on this earth that thick, i took several breaks watching this film just so i could take a minute and resist the urge to put my fist through the TV screenand lastly these are my opinions, you may like it but the entire concept is completely unbelievable, hopefully one day we'll get horror masterpieces back again (NOES, Halloween, Chucky, etc)",V-H-S

It has chills, thrills, horror, suspense, psychological craziness, the supernatural, gore, and more than I can remember right now. It has six different horror stories, each unique on its' own with different horror sub-genres involved in each. I gave the rating 7 stars because since it does contain so many different aspects of the horror genre, it's sensible to realize that you're not going to like every single second of it; but that does not make it a bad movie in the least! It had a little bit of everything and as an anthology film every story can hold its' own weight as a short film but the underlying plot that ties the whole film together does a fantastic job making the whole thing seem real. Real enough that you can entertain the idea that something like this COULD exist, which I highly value in a movie.",V-H-S

People break into a house to steal videos for an unkown reason. They watch the videos which show short horror movies and then die themselves. That's the whole plot, even a child can think of a better plot, I don't know what they thought while making this movie. These short horror movies have the same structure: People enjoying their time by doing something nice, then they die. Before dying, they experience something extraordinarily weird but they don't seem to mind. They behave AS STUPID AS POSSIBLE. Nobody would be like ""Hey cool, there are arms coming out of the wall, a child sitting on a chair, then disappearing, let's stay in the scary house and check out what these noises are"", are you fucking kidding me? Another example: Someone is running away, almost gets away, then falls off the stairs and breaks something so they get caught and die. REALLY??? WHY?! I was waiting for the main story to continue until the end but there is no main plot, the people who break into the house just die and then it ends. Please don't waste 2 hours of your life, I think everyone can make a better movie.Why 2 Stars? The only story I kind of liked was the one with the weird girl who magically transformed into a weird creature which kills people. It was creepy but still made in a bad way, it could have been better. In the end the last survivor of this story dies because he fell off the stairs and broke his arm so the creature can catch him.

It is simply 5 unconnected scary stories.

What a fantastic ride. From the creepy home video perspective to the pretty ridiculously awesome kill scenes... this movie is totally a MUST WATCH for Halloween season. Vampires, slashers, haunted houses and witches. Something for everyone.The shorts don't need to make perfect sense, just lose yourself in this scary place for 1hr 38min.

Enough plugs, onto the film right? My review. See it! If you love horror, if you hate horror, if you think you might like it and wanna try it out, just see it! Without spoiling anything I will say that there are about 5 or 6 anthology stories tied around a main story in which four guys break into a house to look for a specific video tape. They find a lot more, let me tell you. Some of the segments are better than others (trust me, you'll know which ones) but overall, V/H/S is one of the most imaginative, jolting, riveting, heart-beating-outside-of-your-chest-because-its-so-intense horror films of recent time.

Every segment did not hold equal weight, but the succubus sequence was really fun. For me, 10/10. If the whole movie had been as fun as that story, I would have been totally satisfied. I love a good scary movie, and I found that though the other stories were not quite as good as the succubus story, that I still enjoyed them.

Way to much rubbish blank footage throughout film as well. The death scenes try too hard to shock and end up looking too fake as well .

With the exception of the last one the shorts go from bad (Second Honeymoon)to meh (Tuesday the 17th and The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger). Most shorts have a tempo problem. They feel long and are unable to give a chill to the viewer. The last short from Radio Silence is the best the movie as to offer. 10/31/98 is entertaining and well executed.

I can just about put up with found-footage. I wish it wasn't used as much as it is, but it is forgivable from time to time. In my mind, the only saving grace for this film was that they did actually (for the most part) try to explain why each protagonist was filming the events that occurred (Take note, Paranormal Activity). Otherwise, each story arc was predictable, at times down-right unbelievable, and failed to come to any genuine climax, with the action overall being broken up by the god awful wrap-around.

Before I start the review I have to say, what annoys me is any review here that doesn't understand the genre really shouldn't get to review it. I mean to complain about shaking camera, when it's a found-film sub- genre, I mean really???! I hate Disney movies, but I don't go on IMDb saying they're rubbish, because it's just my opinion. Those movies weren't made for me. I appeal to everyone who doesn't like horror movies - STOP REVIEWING AND RATING THEM. phew, soap-box rant over!The most interesting thing about this movie is the attempt at mixing the portmanteau horror movie idea with the found-film, it's genius. You can get different directors to do each piece, fun all round. All the vignettes are beautifully crafted and for the most of the movie the tie-in plot works really well. For me, however, it starts to flag near the end, I began to feel that all the stories were so disconnected it was going to be really hard to pull them altogether into a coherent story universe (storiverse?). But this type of horror - the collection of short story horror - which I've not seen attempted since those 60's movies like Roger Corman's Tales of Terror or Freddie Francis' Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (best horror movie name ever, right?) all tend to suffer from the same problem, multiple story arc's start to wear the audience out and start to compete with the wrapping story.

I do not usually like-or watch, films with hand-held cameras, but it actually fit into the plot here, and was not distracting that much. The only thing I regret is that I will never find out what exactly happened in each individual clip - but then again, that's the point of a movie like this.

It's all shot from the point of view of a camcorder and starts with a group of guys mucking about around town, then going to do a job that one of them was hired to do. The job is to steal a VHS from a house, told only that they'll know which one they are supposed to take. What ensues is each of them putting in one of the hundreds of VHS' to try and figure out which one it is they're supposed to take and discovering the surreal and horrifying things on the videos... Try not to sit and pick out any flaws that the film may have, try to just sit back and enjoy the film for what it is and appreciate how well made this film really is! In a world of supposedly 'horrifying!' and 'terrifying!' P.O.V. horror films this one really is an outstanding gem that shines in a sea of mediocrity. Definitely recommend to anyone that appreciates a great horror film.",V-H-S
290,mizzmary24,way too confusing.,3,11 August 2012,"Wasn't really a movie, just a bunch of unrelated shorts one right after the other, with a small segment in between. The shorts themselves were confusing, they moved pretty slow over all, and none were really scary, more just creepy. The effects were alright, especially in the first and last short. More and more during the short scenes, I found myself wanting to get back to the main ""story line"" and find out what was happening to the guys who were supposed to steal the tape. Thing was, you never found out. *spoiler!!* The guy in the chair was obviously killing them off, but you never find out what tape they were looking for, who hired them, if he knew about the tapes and the old man, if it was the old man who called them.. too much was left out for my taste. And then to have a short AFTER the conclusion (if you can call it that) of the main story? What is that all about? If you like found footage movies, stick to the good ones, like Home Movie. Even the Blair Witch Project was better than this, because at least that one had a plot centered around something and the viewer was given more information as the story progressed. There is nothing here except for a few cheap scares, as *spoilers* the guy runs across the basement in the main story, or when the kid runs out and slams the door in the girl's apartment. If there were more to the story, or the people in the movie weren't so very stupid, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. On the upside, *spoiler* you do get gratuitous female nudity, and there's a shot of two chicks making out for about half a minute. Enjoy.",V-H-S

The elements of the movie were obvious, it is very slow moving. I don't really find any of it to be what it claims. Each part was predictable. It is an amateur effort, or seems like it is. There isn't anything cutting edge about it, nothing that makes the genre come alive again. It really is somewhat bush league. What hooked us was the warning that was on Comcast's on demand description saying that the movie provoked strong reactions in some viewers. Frankly, that was the most exciting thing about the movie. It reminded me of b slasher movies from the 70s and 80s. If you actually want to be frightened, watch Amatyville Horror, or the Strangers. The found footage thing is very overused and seems trite, as if the director couldn't quite weave together an actual plot.

A group of misfits are hired by an unknown third party to burglarize a desolate house in the countryside and acquire a rare tape. Upon searching the house, the guys are confronted with a dead body, a hub of old televisions and an endless supply of cryptic footage, each video stranger than the last.Directed by America's most talented 10 directors and produced by Magnolia this movie will tell you the real story of the old times.Magnolia is a production that never disappoints.And to prove that,they have made more then 5 smash horror movies including Apartment 143,Rec 3:Genesis,V/H/S and more.And now I wanna discuss the technique.I'm just stunned by how they pulled it off.It's the most convincing movie ever.They don't show much like Paranormal Activity because they act like they are in the situation.The Skype conversations are low quality just like recorded from a web-cam.The camera is shaking just like anybody would react if they get in a paranormal situation.",V-H-S

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war.

It is important to note before watching this movie, there is little fear factor; the people were most likely getting ill because it contains an insurmountable amount of flash/strobe effects (not sure if that is what the film industry calls it,) but this effect can cause seizures in people who are prone to them from epilepsy, or any neurological issues. This should seriously be advertised in the beginning of the film. The camera is hand held the entire time, creating that ""roller coaster"" feeling, because it is rarely fixed on an image for too long, and the camera is swung all over. The first 30-45 minutes, it is viciously unsteady. The movie's greatest suspense element for me was wondering when I would eventually vomit from the movement. Poorly done, and not very scary. I would compare the footage to someone's home video, and even that could have made more sense than the movie.",V-H-S

298,tmbaio-501-141371,Several Bits of Stories Clumped Together; Not a Movie,2,27 December 2012,"V/H/S is, as the title of this review states, several pieces of incomplete story-telling made complete only due to the stories being bunched together.Several reviews have compared this film to the likes of Creepshow, Trilogy of Terror, Tales from The Darkside, etc. These comparisons are as unwarranted as they are unfair. The mentioned anthology films took what precious little time they had & successfully gave to the audience stories containing a coherent beginning, middle & conclusion. The makers of V/H/S make no attempt whatsoever to replicate this type of storytelling. Watching the film is no different than walking in on a conversation that is already taking place. There is utterly no attempt to answer the who, what, when, where or how questions generated by each of the film's segments. Sympathetic characters are another thing low in number for the movie as well (in fact, the few sympathetic ones found are strangely met with cruel denouement). Plot holes however, are in great abundance (much much too many for stories of such short length).The movie gets its 2 stars for the same # of reasons broken down here:_the first segment (imagine Cloverfield with a vampire) shows promise & is very well put together._ Ti West (a director who continues to receive critical & fan praise despite making long, meandering & brutally dull movies) is thankfully forced to get to the point of his story. Its not good, but its mercifully short.In summary, V/H/S is an anthology movie that feels incomplete. There is no attempt to give the characters any history, reasoning, motives, etc. This may have worked on paper or as an idea, but fails where it counts most......when being presented to a thinking audience.",V-H-S

As a horror fan I don't find his scary at all it does not add to the suspense of the film or give it a different ""angle"" it just becomes annoying. What has happened to horror films these days? Don't watch this film it is a massive waste of time and energy, get yourself down to Blockbuster and hire yourself a good horror film like Chainsaw massacre, Saw, Hostel, Aliens etc.",V-H-S
300,taylor-robert-2009,Average,4,21 October 2012,"OK, so I'm not a huge fan of found footage films, and this whole VHS idea has been done before with films like video violence etc, but I thought I'd give this a watch. This seems to be quite a convenient way of making films. There is no real need to introduce characters, tell a story, put effort into cinematography and editing is a piece of cake when the camera is being thrown in every possible direction. Nonetheless, I did enjoy some of the... Stories? I guess you could say. Some of the gore effects are really well done, yet some of it is pretty terrible. As usual I find the camera work disgraceful, any idiot should know how to point and shoot in any normal situation, but it is effective in some of the action scenes. As there are 5 different stories in 1, I got quite frustrated as I found myself wanting to know more with too many unanswered questions. This can be a good thing when done deliberately but I think in this case it reverts back to not building a plot or telling a story and not introducing characters. We need more traditional horror films with traditional screen writing and NEW IDEAS, not cheap camcorder style short cuts or cashing in on remakes.",V-H-S

The gifted actors understand to behave like teenagers even though they appear to be well above 40. Also the handy cam style of the movie is just joyous and the way the scenes are cut perfectly fits in every instance. After 10 minutes of watching you dream to see all actors full of life, not only in this but also in all their upcoming titles. Well after another 10 minutes you compliment the director and his crew to live in eternal ecstasy.

302,rnwilson8,Above all else read this if you are interested in seeing this movie! (NO spoilers),9,1 November 2012,"I cannot stop laughing at these poorly written reviews bashing this film. It just amazes me the logic of some of these self-anointed critics who have posted before me and even worse continually talk about their love for the horror genre! Let me start by saying this. This movie is fun and a little different. This has always been the key to horror movies! For nearly a century creative efforts have been made to spook us, scare and startle us, and most importantly let us have fun for a few hours. This movie did just that. You can only reinvent the wheel so many times. Horror films (especially out of all genres) historically have tended to copycat whats trending at that time and build off of it with each film's own flavor and twist on things. I am absolutely exhausted on listening to people rip apart the contemporary movement of ""found footage"" films. It's not destroying it at all, its filling seats you fools. A movie like Paranormal Activity may not be Gone With The Wind but it put a lot of asses in seats. Its basic economics, when this happens there is a demand for horror movies and thus there is more financial backing and a revitalization yet again for the horror genre. Studios suddenly want their own version of that current success. The result is we get more and more horror films to watch:) Every decade horror has supposedly been coming to an end creatively and ending soon because of (insert period reason) and yet here we are in 2012 chugging right along.People have either loved this movie or ripped on this movie incessantly throughout these reviews. That in itself speaks volumes about V/H/S. Its polarizing, which means its daring and different. So every single one of these shredding reviews only makes people wonder why its commonly a ""10"" or a ""1""? Bottom line is what did all of you expect? the movie is called V/H/S! That title doesn't exactly scream a film of profound life changing material. It was a fun, original movie and all of you that take these reviews so negatively have no business watching horror films in the first place. You obviously do not get it. Real horror fans prefer you not spoil the fun in the genre. Go away.Lastly, to all of you that complained about character development and explanations. Be quiet, its an anthology consisting of 5 stories. There simply isn't enough time to give you what you want. Not to mention, since when, to a certain extent, do we care about character development and strong plot lines in horror anyways? The majority of reviews i have read on here that contain this displeasure of said items, are the same people that talk about how they love the swiftness of anthology films.To the many of you, who love horror, and don't take it too seriously, because you understand the genre, watch this. Most importantly, remember to HAVE FUN with the film. Something that most of these ""critics"" do not do anymore.",V-H-S

I watched approximately twenty minutes of this film before turning it off. I am sorry but it is just pure dirt. I cannot believe how low the horror movie industry has gone. The freelance camera work is so tired. It just runes the quality of the movie. You may as well have the video camera tied by a piece of string to the end of a stick. I find the graphic content appalling the way both men and woman are degraded is disgusting. There is no need for it. It extremely distasteful.I would hate to think that teenagers are watching this filth. What is the world coming to at all. I thought horror movies were supposed to be scary. This was a yawn fest. I was genuinely so bored I had to turn it off. I could not connect to any of the caricatures and the story line or lack of it was going nowhere. If this is, were horror movies are going it is a travesty.This is only my opinion of what I thought of this film. Everyone is free to voice there own. I have always been a lover of a good horror movie. However, this one just does not make the cut. That is why I am only giving it a 1-10 unfortunately. I think the word beside the number speaks for itself (awful).",V-H-S

I read an article online where it was featured, and I had a free redbox rental, so I tried it out. Let me just say, that I am a HUGE horror fan and I have been really let down with the genre lately. This movie was definitely a nice surprise.I'm not exaggerating when I say that I haven't been that scared during a movie for a long time!! Definitely one to watch with the lights off for sure. From early on, I was constantly terrified, and they left just enough to the imagination to make it all the more scary. One thing I also really enjoyed was the gore!! Very nicely done, not too much, not too little.One thing I don't really understand about some negative reviews on here is people complaining about the lack of character development. There're six stories put into one movie, of course you're not going to have time for a back story. But the thing that's great about V/H/S is that it doesn't even need the character development to enthrall you! Each story throws you right into each character's situation, which makes the experience all the more terrifying. I really enjoyed this. I honestly have not been that scared in a while. Highly recommend this for a totally different experience than you're used to from the run-of-the-mill mainstream horror crap that's come out lately.",V-H-S
309,peterparkeris,hit and miss...,4,31 October 2013,"Fairly predictable that within an anthology of horror stories some are more effective than others. Add to that a plethora of different directors, actors and genres, and any small chance of a consistent level of quality is even harder to guarantee. The problem with this collection is that even the most effective of the short films here is not enough to outweigh the other very mediocre offerings. Two of the stories do contain some well crafted,if clichéd, horror moments and there are one or two genuinely fresh approaches to the 'found footage' genre. The remainder of the collection flits between a clumsy, bordering on lazy, rehashing of more successful films of this type-think Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity- and then disjointed story telling that works too hard on incorporating as many horror flick tricks as possible into a twenty minute tale and consequently forgets the need for an involving narrative.The narrative is perhaps the biggest failure of V/H/S. The film is crying out for a cleverly written and ingeniously subtle collective narrative to bind these tales together and give a sense of cohesion and purpose to the seemingly, and unfortunately,actually unrelated collection of V/H/S cassettes. But alas the central storyline is as shallow and crude as the characters that it contains. There are no clever twists or overall sinister motives to be found here. In fact the film would have been much easier to accept if the anthology had just been showcased as a collection of unconnected short films. As it is though, the 'bolt on' overriding scenario manages to further highlight the shortcomings of the collection.The erratic quality level applies to all aspects of the film, from directing to acting. There are glimpses of some very clever mis- direction and half a handful of genuinely talented horror film actors. However for every successful set piece or convincing character portrayal there are double the instances of tired, over used scare moments and toe curling dialogue delivered by actors who seem fully aware of the scripts ability to bend foot fingers.As a rental or 'on TV' choice then the sporadic successful moments do make V/H/S worth seeing, but there is nothing here to justify repeat viewings or ownership.",V-H-S
310,ShatteredWaves,A real mixed bag,5,28 May 2013,"As a cohesive viewing experience, V/H/S is a complete and utter failure. As a selection of short horror films, it still isn't a success, but it does deliver in some respect. Glued together by a very loose narrative - a group of idiotic young men decide to burgle a house for a tape, find the guy who owns the house dead and decide to watch some mysterious VHS tapes they find around the house. Each time a VHS is played, a short film is shown, displaying what is on each VHS. Each short film has a paranormal twist and is handled by different directors. Only two of these segments are any good at all really - the first segment entitled Amateur Night and the final segment entitled 10/31/98. These are the only segments with any real atmosphere or coherent narrative behind them and as such the only sequences which stand out for repeat viewings. Amateur Night is a fairly good modern take on the succubus myth and 10/31/98 is a fantastic, frantic haunted house story. The other sections of the film fail to live up to their standard and as a result, the middle of the film is very dull and forgettable by any standard, comprised either of muddled sci-fi horror or laughable slashers.If anything, V/H/S works as a showcase for several up and coming directors, rather than as an actual film. If it's a taste of things to come from each of these directors then I can only honestly say I have any anticipation for David Bruckner (director of the Amateur Night sequence) and Radio Silence (the collective behind 10/31/98). Those two segments are genuinely good horror shorts with enough strength for repeat viewings. They're also strong enough to warrant a higher rating and rise the film above mediocrity. On the whole, despite having an interesting concept, V/H/S just doesn't hold together as much as I might have hoped. It certainly had potential to be not just the holy grail of found footage films, but the holy grail of modern American horror, which has frankly become laughable in recent years. Alas, it was never meant to be. A sequel is on the way in 2013 (formerly titled S-V/H/S, a much better title than what it is now called - simply V/H/S/2) and with any luck that can bring together some better writers and directors to make a more consistent set of horror shorts.",V-H-S
311,tripleh_693,Interesting concept but ruined due to bad directing and poor writing.,4,14 July 2013,"When i saw the trailer for VHS for the first time, needless to say that, i was excited. I thought ""Oh cool, 5 horror stories shot Blair Witch style ? Sign me up right away !"" Then the movie was released and my brother bought it for 10 bucks at a local store. Needless to say that, once again, i was excited to finally have the chance to watch V/H/S the movie that many sites that i follow talked about and the result ? A 110 minutes of absolute crap.The set-up for the movie is just plain awful. A bunch of idiots (one of them supporting a pretty hilarious mustache) who get off on exposing womens breasts in front of their boyfriends and destroy windows with baseball bats (it happens), break into a house for a supposed ""job"" and have to find a certain tape for some money. First off, this doesn't work. Why does the directors didn't just show the title and then directly into tape no.1 ? Why did they need this needlessly complicated and, in the end, completely pointless set-up ? This set-up last a good 10 to 15 minutes before the first story even starts.Then the first tape starts and for the most part, it's pretty good. A bunch of friends decide to go to local bars in order pick-up girls to have sex with them but they will get much more then that. The set-up is interesting (though pretty dumb), it's directed OK and the pay-off is original...and it's all downhill from there...The second tape is just an unbearable snore-fest. A couple goes on a road trip but come across a weird women during their trip. This story is Way Way too long and absolutely nothing happens. The couple have some pretty bland talk, with nothing interesting to say. It's not scary cause everything happens in daylight and the pay-off at the end just makes you go ""what ?...HOW ?"" Nothing happens until the last 5 minutes. So, you have a pretty good 20 minutes of nothing and then BAM ! A punchline that has absolutely nothing memorable what so ever.Then the third tape starts and....oh boy...this one is the absolute worst one of the bunch. A bunch of friends decide to go to the woods for camping but they come across a new kind of slasher villain. What completely KILLS this one is two things: The directing and the writing. The directing because the whole thing is just extremely amateurish, this is the shortest one of the bunch and it shows. The gore is made with CGI when the rest of the movie is using practical effects, the kills just comes out of nowhere with BARELY an explanation. In the space of 2 minutes 3 of the 4 characters die with some very weak slasher movie kills. The writing starts being terrible when the main character tells the last guy alive: ""You guys were bait to lure him so i could finish him off."" OK, first of all, why did you come back here ? Yeah probably to close this chapter of your life but if the killer wasn't following you and was staying in the woods, why didn't you just...let it go ? Second, when she's running around in the woods away from the killer, the killer starts falling into all these traps that she set-up. If it was the first time that she came back here since the first killing spree, HOW THE HELL WAS SHE ABLE TO PUT ALL THOSE ELABORATE TRAPS ? In 10 to 15 minutes this segment managed to snag the award for ""Worst Slasher Ever"".The 4th story is mostly OK but ruined by the ending, which makes no sense. A girl in her apartment is haunted by ghosts all while talking to her boyfriend. The direction is OK, the whole thing is filmed through a web-cam on a laptop computer which is kind of creative. The acting from the boyfriend in this story is not very good. He never reacts to anything that happens in the apartment of his girlfriend. He just delivers with the same emotionless expression on his face. The twist at the end, pretty much says a big ""F*** You"" to everybody who was expecting some kind of interesting ghost story. During the whole story the boyfriend says: ""I know you have problems and i'll be here in the next 7 days, so hold on."" And when the girlfriend is found unconscious probably due to a ghost attack, THE BOYFRIEND COMES OUT OF A ROOM INSIDE THE APPARMENT OF HIS GIRLFRIEND !!! Also, it turns out that he was making deals with the ghosts in order to do...i don't know it's never explained. The guy just comes out of a room cuts his girlfriend back for some pointless gore then pulls out a....thing. You never know what it is, what it does or why it was there in the first place.The 5th one was pretty...OK, though the writing was weird. A bunch of friend go to a Halloween party at a random house when they get there, they realize that the house is haunted (who sent the invitation in the first place ?). The atmosphere in this one is pretty good. Right off the bat, you can tell that there is something wrong in this house. From there, it's pretty much straightforward. Some scary stuff happens and the characters run away.Overall, VHS is a pretty bad horror film. It's long , the characters are ALL without any exception macho douche-bags, the writing is terrible, the direction is not very good, there's some pretty gratuitous breast shot of women in this movie that makes no sense, the set-up of the whole movie is just laughable. Only 2 out of the 5 stories are worth watching (one is good the other is just OK). It's a mess.",V-H-S

There is a long history of scary tales presented within a loose story line, portmanteau horror. One that did truly scare me was the 1945 film Dead at Night. Dated, yes, but shows how to make the genre work. Do not waste your time with v/h/s. Now I know why this film was so cheap.",V-H-S
314,tmorgan_2200,Interesting premise...,7,24 October 2016,"I don't consider myself a fan of the found footage genre, but I've seen V/H/S show up on several lists of the best of the genre, so I thought I'd check it out.There's some semblance of story setup (bunch of thugs break into a house to steal a tape, but find a dead body and a bunch of other tapes instead). Then it dives into a series of unrelated short films.In a feature you need a story; in shorts you can get by with a gag. I'm going to give the writers a tip of my hat and admit each of the shorts has an effective gag. Some of the shorts work better than others and some just don't work at all.A few of the shorts feature some head-scratching, WTF moments. There are a couple of scenes that almost threw me out of the movie, but I'm glad I continued to watch.I think the team put most of the film's budget into the last short and it shows. I feel it was the best of the batch. I was going to rate the film a 5 but as I think about it, the effectiveness of that last short warrants a higher mark.If you're a horror fan and/or a found footage fan in particular, you can't go wrong streaming this.",V-H-S

I could sit here and ramble on for hours about how the movie wasn't scary/had no coherent thought/had atrocious writing and acting/and just failed to make any real sense at all - but that would give the movie justification of sort. It's so bad it doesn't deserve a fraction of the time it would take to explain why it's so bad.This movie sucks - and I've seen reviews for other horror movies in the past where people would say not to watch it, but you go and watch it anyway... Don't do that with this movie. Seriously, just don't watch it, it's awful. That is all.",V-H-S

It has got no point in it, no sense, no creativity..no anything...wannabe scary clips randomly mixed together..the result, a so called ""horror"" movie, which didn't scare me a single time. I can't believe there are so many positive reviews on this and I can only warn all of you people out there who haven't decided yet whether they are gonna or are not gonna watch V/H/S. Please use your time more wisely, call a friend, get some food, feed your pet or simply watch another movie...seriously...it's bad. Really bad.After watching this movie I started doubting that there is any sense in this life. Why would somebody produce such a bad movie? Why would somebody have anybody go through the pain and misery of watching this piece of crap? Where is the love? I started crying. It doesn't make any sense. I always thought that there was a silver lining, a little piece of hope, something to hold on. There isn't. I wish film- making would never have been invented. I don't know what to do. I'm lost.",V-H-S
317,abdulkadircelik,Scary but doesn't make any sense,6,18 March 2016,"First excited when i watched the trailer.Then watched the movie by this excitement. Generally it was okay as a scary thing but as a film, a plot, a screenplay it was not okay. First of all cameras are frequently shakes which disturbs me very very much. Secondly throughout the movie i asked myself what is going on?, why this character doing this?, what is it? etc. Nothing is explained at the end of the movie.As i remember there are five V/H/S cassettes plus the some guys who watching this cassettes. As this guys (each time one of them) watching this cassettes weird things are happening in the room. Overall the characters especially creepy (and scary as hell) ones are very good and original i think. Idea is good, but execution is a little problematic in my opinion. If you want to scare, go watch this movie you won't be disappointed but if you are looking for a good plot, probably this movie not for you.",V-H-S
318,christopherbailey8989,Don't watch this for the film quality or cohesiveness of plot... It SCARES YOU which is what a horror movie should do.,8,20 November 2014,"I am not going to write a deep, analytic review of this movie because I do not believe it was made with the intention of being a ""masterpiece"" or a movie that contains a deep/mind blowing plot. This movie was made with one purpose: to TERRIFY,DISTURB, and get inside the viewer's head for days. I was overwhelmed by the pure evil present in each video (though some were worse than others)and just how messed up the whole thing was. It takes almost every horror sub-genre,and combines them in ways that beat you to your knees. I definitely understand why people got up and left the theaters, fainted,or couldn't stomach watching it because watching this movie felt torturous at times. The directors combine the pure evil found in the human spirit and compound it with that of otherworldly evil beings.So many ""horror"" movies miss the mark, and instead provide cheap thrills that satisfy the viewer in the way that a roller coaster would. This film was made from an evil, morbid, sick and twisted place that leaves viewers in a state of disturbance and despair. IT TRULY SCARED ME.Though I did come away terrified and disturbed, I couldn't help but appreciate the fact that this movie actually does what a horror movie is meant to do and that is truly scare you. If you are a fan of mainstream horror,and have ever found one of those movies to be scary DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. ONLY WATCH THIS IF YOU CAN HANDLE BEING IN A TERRIFIED, DISTURBED, AND BAD STATE OF MIND.",V-H-S
319,jenniferod113,Messy and adolescent - a preteen boys fantasy; basically movie 64 with more gore,2,7 April 2015,"This movie is self indulgent and infantile. It reads like the plot of a porn film with its unnecessary nudity and perversions. I'm no prude and I usually don't have a problem with this but when you're a fan of horror you want to see a horror film, not fifteen minutes of boobs. The writers clearly wanted to explore their deepest, darkest most perverted fantasy and this is obvious when watching the film. However, the special effects were excellent, so good in fact, at times I had to look away it looked so real and the same can be said for the acting. The reactions of the characters are more real than most horror films, and I commend that. Some of the premises were actually very original and I probably would've enjoyed watching one of those films more, however the plot of this movie, and how it is sloppily woven together just didn't make sense. The common theme throughout the film seems to focus on men being undone by women and their lust for them. It's an overdone and tired trope and really just objectifies the women in this film. Each female character perfectly falls into one of the female archetype tropes- the bitch. the slut, the virgin etc. And the male characters aren't much better. They all have the same horny, frat boy personality type and the few who don't are manipulative and controlling of the weak women in their lives. In conclusion, the film has little plot. The whole storyline doesn't make sense and is frankly confusing to watch. Eventually, I just had to surrender to the illogicality of it all or risk madness.",V-H-S
320,juliusfunder,Disappointed,3,28 April 2015,"So... i watched the trailer and it made me really excited about V/H/S. So i started watching and it did start off pretty straight forward. The build up at the beginning was okay, and i was waiting for a plot twist or climax.. But it never really came. Some of the VHS movies are disturbing and violent. Others are really weird and does not make any sense at all. Some of them are creepy others are way to weird to be. The ending didn't help the movie at all and it just made me wondering if the movie had a plot at all. So despite the OKAY score here on IMDb.com, i just want to tell you this movie is really boring and makes no sense at all throughout.",V-H-S
321,superzemus,An Enjoyable Abstract,5,15 July 2015,"For an experience that does not leave you scratching your head (and possibly shaking it), approach this movie as you would an abstract painting: keep an open mind and do not expect a Tarantino-esque story. That said, even as an abstract painting, it is amateur. No deep, intelligent thought can be seen behind its odd, nonsensical brushstrokes of special effects, but the tantalizing visuals and the nearly constant sense of impending terror is rather entertaining to experience. You can view it as a casserole of loose threads and frayed story lines, or you can view it as a collection of mildly enjoyable horrific visions that you just can't quite prove didn't happen.Won't rewatch, won't watch the others in the ""series"", but I don't consider the nearly two hours spent on the couch wasted.",V-H-S
322,theotherminers,Underrated Horror Fun,8,6 December 2015,"This movie gets a bad rap for some reasons that i sometimes understand but most of the time find ridiculous.I think that the movie is extremely good at portraying who characters are in a short amount of time, sure some of them are a little cliché and are generally assholes but the entire point of this movie seems to be that no one is perfect and everyone is an asshole in some way.This movie was not lazy and actually created suspense instead of throwing in random jump-scares, but in the most scary segment ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"" there was a jump scare that was dumb. If your someone who was turned off by the negative reviews, just give it an open minded try and I'm sure you will be spooked. This is what i think about the individual segments Tape 56 - 6/10 (underwhelming but still cool)Amateur Night - 8/10 (overrated) Second Honeymoon - 9.5/10 (almost perfect)Tuesday the 17th - 5.5/10 (the worst one)The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger - 8.5/10 (too scary and had the only ""jumpscare"" in the film.) 10/31/98 - 6/10 (too much cg compared to the rest of the film)",V-H-S
323,imalittleasianboy,Frightfully Unaware,3,7 November 2016,"Here's my rundown of the movie: V/H/S is a movie about guys making a movie about going into a home to watch movies. One-by-one, they sit on the floor in front of a dead guy in a chair and watch his collection of VHS tapes. The guys themselves are all about breakin' cities and shaking' titties, but when it comes to this case of spooky tapes, it seems the carpet don't always match the drapes! What you see is never what you would expect to get. The real reason this movie was scary is because throughout its entirety there was an eerie, ambient, 4-second piece of music repeating in the background. When I paused the movie, I came to find that the music was playing from a different source. After I turned it off and resumed viewing, it was nothing' but laughs. A 5-Star film for any comedy lover!

I'm always trying to find sickening horror flicks but I think they all get ruined by the crappy character building and story lines. You know which character is going to die when and how. They all explain the origin of the ghost/killer/monster/entity and the latest films just don't have enough boobs.Now take a movie like ""Cabin in the woods"". The horror in that movie is something we mortals would never understand just like the stuff that goes on in the V/H/S movies. Watchin all three game me a little idea of the story that's underneath all the events but I still don't get it which makes me want to watch them again.Last thing I liked about the films was the unfamiliar actors. Not the same faces you see in all the Hollywood based movies. That's the power of indie films.Overall: Lots of horror, lots of gore and just the right amount of boobies.9/10",V-H-S

326,onecrunchywiddlepickle,"Great Movie, Don't tell me otherwise",9,8 May 2017,"Let me start by saying that the VHS series is one of the best movie series of the millennium. Not only does it have an interstellar cast of, Randy Newman, Paul Rudd, Kate Olsen, (The Black one), and probably my dad. You may be asking yourselves why i'm taking the time and effort to type out a movie review about probably one of the most obscure and stupidist movie franchises in all of my asshole, its because i trying to convey the meaning and thought that VHS is probably one of the most brilliantly executed and most well thought out movies of our generation. If anyone out there named Joe Regal, specifically think other wise, your gay and smelly.VHS is a masterfully shot and marvelously executed piece of drama and art. The tender care and Thought that went into every alien dance sequence, and Hilarious and side splitting fart joke truly holds up when Paul Rudd's character, ""stinky"" gets a call from the E.R saying his mother died from the impact of the collision, and stinky throws his arms into the air and shouts ""BAZAANGLE BOJANGLE"" The plot of VHS still holds up even after its release in 1867 B.C, real quick- I think that that and that alone is enough to divorce your wife and cut all previous ties with your family and to go see this work of aspiring art.A quick summary of the plot, Randy Newman's and Kate Olsen's (The Black one) characters get into a heated argument in whether or not Kettle corn is gross or not (which it clearly is and stop trying to say its not.) Well, Kate Olsen (The Black one)'s character says its not, and Randy Newman's character decided to give up because his family is probably dead after 400 years of arguing and are probably really gross and smelly. Kate Olsen's character, (The Black one) takes out a bag of succulent little kernels begins to one throat each one of them and walks away, but then she explodes, because in the previous scene she just ate an entire 32"" pizza even though she is lactose intolerant. I think this scene and this scene and this scene alone perfectly describes how well all three installments of the VHS series blends and choreograph's into this nice clean consistent work, and truly symbolizes the inner meaning and dialogue of the characters and writings.this is exactly what happened and how the movie plays out and if you don't think so, then your flat out wrong and poopy. Especially if your name is joey and you are a hoey, then your reeeaallly poopy and stinky.I give the Boxcar Children a solid 9.8/10",V-H-S

Someone lied to me because this movie sucked. There was nothing new or exciting about this movie. Each story was a rehash of another horror movie/genre or urban legend.Amateur Night: The girl was a vampire. Not very new or even interesting. Plus all the bar footage was hard to hear and it was clear that it was a set up from the beginning.Second Honeymoon: Classic Black Widow story that has been done so much better so many times before. Tuesday the 17th: A poor man's Jason Voorhees. It takes place at a lake with a killer who can't be killed and likes his knives sharp and his women disembowel? Sounds like Jason to me.The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger: This is the only story that had any chance of originality. The theme of aliens masquerading as ghosts has been done but the 'boyfriend' was a nice twist. If they would have expanded on this and fleshed out what was happening it would have have been so much better.10/31/98: This story is as old as dirt. People have been telling the story of the guest who show up at the wrong place with deadly consequences and ghost hitchhikers have been around since horse and buggy days. Not one bit of original thought went into this story.The Wrap Around Story: Zombie rip off of Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things with Orville sitting on the chair instead of the bed and then coming to live and eating the naughty little boys.This movie was dreck.

330,Zarile3-1,"Bad acting, major plot holes, and laughable stories...",3,10 August 2012,"**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**OK, so I'm going to break this down by each story, I'll try my best to not spoil them, but expect spoilers as I had issues with a few things that happened in the movie. I'll give a score for each of the short films, and then a general score at the end.Part 1 : Amateur NightThis one was interesting. I really enjoyed the build up, but felt that some of the acting just wasn't up to par. The ""third wheel"" guy was pretty funny, randomly laughing at things but never really adding to the conversation, he added humor to the story, but also took away from it. This one wasn't very scary though, stuff like the vampire ripping the guys penis off and tossing it aside made me laugh more than anything....I'll give this one a 5/10. Part 2: Second HoneymoonBoring. I was most disappointed with this one as it was directed by Ti West, who has directed two of my favorite recent horror films (House of the Devil and The Innkeepers). The relationship this couple has is really weird and I just couldn't buy it at all. At one point they act really close, while other things they do make it seem like they're just friends. There is a twist, and it just isn't that interesting. 4/10 for this one.Part 3: Strange Thing That Happened to EmilyWhere do I start? There is absolutely no answer to anything that's going on in this one, making me wonder why they even went with something that could have been great had we received some answers. Who exactly is this guy working for? (we know it's aliens, but why?) How is he in the same house, or next door apartment, without ever coming in contact with her? What's with the ghostly children, are they illusions, aliens, real ghosts? There are so many plot points in this one that should have been answered. I will say though, this was probably the scariest of the short films, the girl running in and slamming the door gave me chills...it could have been a full film IMO. 6/10 for this one.Part 4: Tuesday the 17thSeriously? This one was a joke. The acting is sub-par at best, especially the girl that brings them there. The scenes of death were terrible as well, while the rest of the movie had good or just okay looking gore, this movie looks like something I would have put together with friends when I was 15. The killer in this short wasn't scary either, it seemed like they were going for The Ring mixed with Slender Man, minus the scary. It was predictable, and laughable....SKIP this one. 2/10.Part 5: 10/31/98The acting on all parts was pretty good. I enjoyed the banter between the four guys. My biggest question though, if you're going to a party and show up at a house that looks empty...would you really just go inside? You call out for your friend but they don't answer back, so it's OK to just walk in? The beginning was creepy with the random ghosts showing up, but after they found the ritual in the attic it went downhill. Running down the stairs and things start slamming and moving around, plates are levitating and flying at people, but it just wasn't scary, it was funny, not scary. 5/10.Part 6: Tape 56This is the story that's happening around all of the others. I thought we'd get some crazy wrap up where things somehow fit together, or at least make some sort of sense...but no, it seemed more like random scenes of these guys looking for a tape in the house. Since the scenes are broken up between the other short stories, we get no tension or excitement, just short scenes of these guys looking for a tape and randomly getting scared. The guy that brings them there, is he their friend, or just some random creepy dude the came across...he was an asshole either way (I guess they all are) and it just didn't seem plausible that his ""friends"" would follow him to something like this. A lot of the movie just didn't make much sense, some of them were just bad, some had massive plot holes, and most were just laughable at best. The fact that twice in the same movie (though different stories) a guy falls at the last few steps while running down the stairs and breaks something (his wrist and then someones ankle) really shows that the amount of creativity here is lacking. Overall it was filled with mostly bad acting, lots of gore, and some laughably stupid stories. I'll give the film a 4/10.",V-H-S

332,colemccormack1023,The Best In The Series,7,18 October 2018,"V/H/S is a 2012 found footage horror film. It's an anthology film which means that six different directors came together to make each segment. There are 6 total segments; ""Tape 56"", ""Amateur Night"", ""Second Honeymoon"", ""Tuesday the 17th"", ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"", and ""October 31st, 1998"". The plot is about criminals who have to find a specific tape in an old abandoned house. They find a box full of old V/H/S tapes and a dead body. They have to go through each tape in order to find the right one. Each tape is a segment in the anthology. The segments in the film tend to be hit or miss. ""Amateur Night"" and ""October 31st, 1998"" are really well done. They were suspenseful and very scary. However, ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"" and ""Tuesday the 17th"" weren't all that interesting. Second Honeymoon had an interesting twist but it was a very slow build up. It was okay but extremely slow. Tape 56 is merely a frame for all of these events to happen. The special effects overall were very well done. There was never a point where I was taken out of the film because of a bad effect. The acting in the film was mediocre some actors did well some failed. Like the segments, it was really hit and miss.",V-H-S
333,veark,A Bloody Disgusting waste of time,1,28 January 2020,"I thought the premise of the movie sounded boring and unimaginative so I avoided seeing this until a stumbled across an old article on Bloody Disgusting raving about this film. I figured if a ""reputable and unbiased"" site like Bloody Disgusting gave it a glowing review then I'd give it a go. Oh how I was wrong to trust their judgment!I could go into why this is such an atrocity of a film but plenty of other users have adequately done so. What I will tell you is that anyone who is raving about this film is either 1. a person with a vested interest in the film or 2. a conformist who's too afraid to be a contrarian in the face of seemingly credible endorsement.When I saw that Brad Miska was credited as a producer, it suddenly all made sense; Brad Miska is one of the founders of the horror website Bloody Disgusting. So obviously the website is not going to be impartial when reviewing a film one of its founders stands to profit from.As for other positive reviews; I can only assume that these reviewers have been hoodwinked into believing (against their better judgment) that this film has artistic merit and/or is inspired. With so many indie filmmakers contributing to this film plus the fact that horror aficionado's (like Bloody Disgusting) hail this as ""groundbreaking"", I have to conclude that these users unwittingly believe they've watched an arthouse masterpiece rather than a collection of cheap, lazy student films complied into a nearly 2 hour long crap.",V-H-S
