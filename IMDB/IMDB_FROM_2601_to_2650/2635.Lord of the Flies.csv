0,SnoopyStyle,Changes don't all improve story,6,21 April 2015,"A plane crashes in the ocean. The pilot captain Benson and a group of military school cadets reach an isolated island. The injured captain is delirious. Ralph (Balthazar Getty) is the senior cadet who has an injured arms. He tries to organize the boys using the conch found by Piggy. Jack Merridew is the oldest and often fights with the argumentative Piggy. The popular Jack gets obsessed with hunting down the wild pig and the group starts to go wild while Ralph tries to maintain order. The sensitive Simon is shocked at the growing brutality. Captain Benson wanders off. When Jack neglects the signal fire to go hunting, the group splits in two.There are a few changes from the classic novel. They don't all necessarily improve the story. The most troubling is the militarization of the boys. Ralph doesn't get his leadership based on a vote but rather by his cadet ranking. It loses some of the symbolism in the book. The theme of the lost of a democratic civilization is watered down by the boys being military cadets. The captain is an interesting choice and creates some good scenes. The best part of the movie is the use of real young boys. This movie needs the young kids. It is interesting to see a colored version. However if the movie intends to make changes, they should push more towards horror.",Lord of the Flies
1,claudio_carvalho,A Society Without Perspectives and Rules,8,30 March 2007,"After a plane crash in the ocean, a group of military students reach an island. The boy Ralph (Balthazar Getty) organizes the other kids, assigning responsibilities for each one. When the rebel Jack Merridew (Chris Furrh) neglects the fire camp and they lose the chance to be seen by a helicopter, the group split under the leadership of Jack. While Ralph rationalizes the survival procedures, Jack returns to the primitivism, using the fear for the unknown (in a metaphor to the religion) and hunger to control the other boys. His group starts hunting and chasing pigs, stealing the possession of Ralph's group and even killing people.I found this impressive movie very scary, since it shows the behavior of children (and human beings) fighting to survive in a society without perspective and rules. My immediate association was with my and other Third World countries, where many children are abandoned by the Government in their poor communities, and without education, perspectives in life and laws, become very young criminals working in gangs of drug dealers and thieves. In this movie, it is exposed how primitive a kid can be without the authority and respect, and this sort of violence is in the headlines of our newspapers almost every day. There are many discussions presently in Brazil about juvenile criminality. I have never the chance of reading this visionary novel; therefore I can not comment is it is a good or a bad adaptation, but I found this movie a frightening study of characters and sociology. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Senhor das Moscas"" (""The Lord of the Flies"")",Lord of the Flies
2,Coventry,"Respect or even follow the book? Nah, why should we?",3,20 July 2017,"I owned the DVD of ""Lord of the Flies"" for more than 15 years already, but for some reason I kept it wrapped in plastic and refused to watch it for as long as I didn't read the classic William Golding novel on which it is based. Now that I read the book, I sorely regret this choice. I'm not a big reader, but based on the few great works that I did read, I principally learned that you should restrict to one version only; - either the book or the film. By now I wish that I either watched this film, considered it to be just average and simply assume that the novel is similar. OR that I read the book, realize it's fairly impossible to make an equally powerful film out of it and never even bother to unwrap the film from its plastic! The issue with ""Lord of the Flies"" is that it's not a bad movie on itself, but in case you constantly compare it to the brilliant novel stuck in your head, it does become quite terrible! I can't stop making the following reflection: why would one even bother to adapt a legendary novel into a film version if he plans to alter several small but crucial details, as well as simply eliminate most of the symbolism? The genius of Sir Golding's tale lies within the fact that it's the perfect allegory on humanity's true and dark nature! The story painfully illustrates how human beings, regardless of their age or social status, rapidly degrade towards violent savagery when confronted with difficult situations, extreme conditions, lack of surveillance and the increasing urge to rely on survival instincts. This heavy but essential fundament is almost entirely missing in the film. Here we have a bunch of kids running amok on an island, but I never sensed that atmosphere of hopelessness or that genuine fear of the unknown. Two seemingly minor and superficial changes ruin the entire story of the film, in fact. In Golding's novel, all the boys came from a traditional British boarding school, whereas in the film they are American military cadets. This makes a world of difference regarding how they interpret authority or how easily they turn rogue. It's a lot more petrifying to imagine how choir boys metamorphose into face-painted hunters, like the case in the book, rather than military cadets. Another downright dumb change in the script is how they set the events in the present day; late eighties/early nineties. Golding's novel, written somewhere in the early fifties if I'm not mistaken, thrived on the disturbing idea that WWII escalated into an all- devastating nuclear war. The boys still hoped to get rescued, but maybe there even aren't any adults left? Here, the kids are a little worried about Russian but otherwise there isn't any threat coming out of the world next to the island. The mental as well as physical descent into primitivism is missing completely. They boys hair doesn't grow wild, they aren't walking around filthy or wounded, the rivalry between ""civilized"" Ralph and ""barbaric"" Jack doesn't slowly mount, etc. But all the above isn't even half as scandalous as the fact that Golding's symbolism has entirely vanished! If you haven't read the book but only watched the film, you certainly won't be able to explain why the story is called ""Lord of the Flies"". So many aspects that are essential in the book are just mere footnotes in the movie, like the pig's head on a stake, the beach gatherings summoned via blowing on a giant sea shell or the immense fear of ""The Beast"". Just to illustrate that ""Lord of the Flies"" isn't a complete an utter disaster; I have to mention a couple of positive points as well. The Piggy character is definitely the most properly developed one of the film, and truly resembles how he was created by Sir William Golding, although he still could have been even whinier. Most of the young actors certainly give away adequate performances, while the filming locations are breathtaking. I might still do my best to track down the film version released in 1963, as allegedly it's much more faithful to the book, but after that I'll follow my own newly invented rule: either the book or the movie, but not both.",Lord of the Flies
3,grantss,"Not as powerful as it could have been, but still quite interesting",7,3 March 2017,"A plane carrying schoolboys from a military school crashes into the ocean. A group of them make it to an island. After taking stock of their surroundings they settle into a regimen and order, with Ralph as their leader. However, after a while a splinter group emerges, lead by Jack. Jack is hardly a benevolent leader and fascism and barbarism follow... A reasonably interesting adaptation of William Golding's classic novel. I haven't read the book or seen any other adaptations of the novel, though am familiar with the basic plot. So the story is quite original and thought-provoking to me. I did think it would be a more powerful metaphor for society though, so, even without having that background knowledge I sense that this is not a great adaptation of the book.This said, it is quite entertaining and you can see how it mirrors human behaviour.",Lord of the Flies
4,view_and_review,The Ultimate Social Science Experiment,9,19 February 2020,"Like many people, I read ""Lord of the Flies"" in high school. It was required reading, not that I didn't enjoy it. I also watched the 1963 movie ""Lord of the Flies"" and, sadly, I wasn't impressed. So, I really appreciated the 1990 remake--if we can call it that--or maybe we can say the 1990 version. It was so much better. It was in color, it had modern language and references (such as the Rambo reference and the ALF reference), and it did a lot better job capturing the viciousness and animal behavior of the kids.""Lord of the Flies"" is the optimum social science experiment. I liken it to movies such as: ""The Purge,"" ""Die,"" ""Hunger,"" and others (which all came later) in which you can witness the different behavior of people when put in extraordinary situations, whether intentionally or unintentionally. ""Lord of the Flies"" is really the study of how quickly a group of boys would devolve into a state of animality, insanity, and barbarity after being stranded on a deserted island for weeks. To be fair, I would expect adults to regress as well given certain personalities and psychological profiles, so I don't want to unfairly indict young boys.""Lord of the Flies"" the book is a classic and rightly so. I think the 1990 version of the movie, with its profanity and violence, was a superb rendition of the literary work. Not that I'm a fan of profanity and violence, I just think it was far more realistic. I know how I talked and behaved with my peers at ten, eleven, and twelve-years-old, so far be it for me to be moralistic about the kids in this movie.I just wonder how many hours of therapy those boys would require after that experience? That would be a great follow up book or movie: ""Lord of the Flies: Back in the Real World.""",Lord of the Flies
5,FlashCallahan,Beware of falling rocks.....,6,20 January 2013,"After a plane crash in the ocean, a group of military students reach an island. Ralph organises the boys, assigning responsibilities for each one. When rebel Jack neglects the fire camp and they lose the chance to be seen by a helicopter, the group split under the leadership of Jack. While Ralph rationalises the procedures, Jack uses the fear of unknown to control the other boys, and hunting and chasing pigs, stealing Ralph's group and even killing people.....For purists of the source material and the original movie, it's going to irk a few people. Here we don't really have the metaphors of religion and the fear of growing old, it's just a load of boys in pants running amok in the jungle.But it still sort of works. Getty and th other one are really good as Jack and Ralph, almost Cane and Abel in stature, they are friends, then become the best of enemies, for no good reason.Soon the island is split in two, one lead by head, the other by heart, but as the heart is deceitful above all things, the 'head' camp gets gradually smaller as the days go by.It starts off as an adventure for the boys, but soon becomes a nightmare, when people start getting killed. and this is where the film falters, its too dark and grim and savours too much on the deaths of characters.Yes, they have to die to keep the material true, but does it have to be so graphic?Other than that, it's a very wheel made film with some good central performances and quite a good final act.",Lord of the Flies
6,gridoon,Fairly compelling; not as good as it could have been.,7,4 January 2003,"I haven't read the book, which theoretically is an advantage (it is distracting when you have to compare all the time and locate ""what they missed""), but in any case there IS something missing from this film, something that could have made it much better. Is it perhaps the fact that we never get enough background information on the kids for us to truly connect to them? The actors themselves are not bad at all, and the photography  does achieve some beautiful contrasts between the sea and the land. But overall the film is not exceptional in any way.

7,lost-in-limbo,Roast piggy.,6,5 June 2008,"I usually read and hear about this Hollywood remake copping a real shellacking when compared to the original 1963 British b/w version and that of William Golding's 1954 novel of the same title. I don't mind this 90's update, but that's considering I haven't read the book or even watched the first film adaptation. The concept (civilized children struggling with order and reverting to savagery to survive and dominate) would have been disturbing back in those times, but now nothing is too surprising. What disappointed me more than anything was that the drama of the situation isn't as powerful or gripping as it should have been. While it's beautifully photographed in presenting the lush island and accumulates an expressively grandeur score, it still does feel a little empty, tidy and mundane when it needed to be raw, passionate and intense for any real impression. I guess there was too much easy-going scenic and textual activity on director Harry Hook's part. Even when it finally busts its guts (in the dying 15 minutes), you can say it was too late and too short to draw much empathy and dramatic suspense. There are exemplary performances by Chris Furrh and Balthazar Getty. Furrah as the bold, rebellious lad who counter-punches Getty's calm, persistently hopeful leader. Danuel Pipoly is the only one of the remaining cast to standout in some shape. Might not be anything grand or rewarding, but it keeps you watching to the very end.",Lord of the Flies
8,John6Daniels,A good remake worth watching,10,7 April 2021,"In this take we get colour. There are a few differences, yet this movie was done very well.Lord of the Flies 1990 is a suspense, survival movie about a group of children whose plane gets shipwrecked. Many children survive living the pilot dead. They either most join forces, survive or die.This was a beautiful production the children weren't A+actors, yet they held their own and did a good job just as the cast did in 1960's. Soundtrack and suspense were the main highlight of the film. I felt bad when piggy died.Overall, a great film.What an be learned? Division creates order out of chaos. Too many want to lead while their leadership leads to chaos in order to get order.Verdict: Solid movie.",Lord of the Flies
9,mjneu59,another heart of darkness,6,2 December 2010,"William Golding's compelling adventure of the human beast untethered illustrates Darwinism at its most ferocious: this is truly survival of the fittest. The new film version updates the fable from a group of British schoolboys stranded on a tropical island to a team of young American military cadets, a switch Golding himself might have approved of. Watching little soldiers devolve into savages, with all their spit-and-polish discipline reverting to primitive barbarity, is a chilling reminder of the animal lurking just under the skin of any military man. The cast of young unknowns may at times look a little self-conscious in front of the camera, and some of the contemporary dialogue doesn't ring entirely true. But the film itself is beautifully photographed and very carefully arranged (director Harry Hook also served as editor), maintaining a simple mood of accumulating dread: knowing what's about to unfold doesn't make it any less awful to watch.",Lord of the Flies
10,estebangonzalez10,Lazy adaptation and poor performances,5,30 June 2015,"""Mama, mama can't you see? What the Army's done to me? They put me in a barber's chair. Spun me 'round, I had no hair.""Harry Hook's 1990 adaptation of William Golding's classic novel, Lord of the Flies, didn't leave much of an impression on me. I've never read the novel, but from what I've heard there are several differences in this adaptation mainly in that it is a modernized version of the story and that the children are American instead of British. The greatest issue I had with this film is that the child actors weren't very good. There were several scenes in which the delivery of the dialogue felt completely forced and so did the emotional moments where some of the kids' cries felt terribly fake. The film definitely hasn't aged well considering how strong the performances are from child actors nowadays. The second issue I had with this film is that the shocking premise of seeing these innocent kids become savages is something we are very used to seeing now. We are way too familiar with their dark side and we've heard of one too many school shootings on the news. Perhaps we've become desensitized towards this issue, but it doesn't shock the audience now in the way the story intended to. The story itself feels pretty rushed and we never get to spend much time with these characters or get to know who they are. I simply never felt engaged with the story and thought that the transition from one scene to the next was never smooth. The Lord of the Flies' greatest virtue is that the island is gorgeous, so the cinematography was executed pretty well and the visuals were beautiful.The film begins with an underwater sequence as a group of kids are trying to save an injured pilot from drowning. They are a group of young military students who survived a plane crash and fortunately have found a nearby island to settle in. They must find a way to survive while they await rescue so the kids appoint Ralph (Balthazar Getty) as their leader. He assigns different responsibilities for everyone which include searching for food, gathering wood, and keeping the fire camp burning in case a plane or a boat passes by. A couple of days go by and some of the kids get tired of doing their choirs. When Ralph calls their attention, Jack (Chris Furrh) decides he is no longer going to take orders and decides to leave. Several other kids decide to follow Jack and pretty soon the group is divided. Unlike Ralph, Jack is simply concerned with hunting and he could care less about being civilized in this remote island. It doesn't take long before several of the kids begin losing their humanity and joining Jack. Ralph and Piggy (Danuel Pipoly) seem to be the only two rational kids left on the island as rumors of a monster fills the rest of the group with fear.The film really doesn't leave much room for analysis or interpretations, and the book probably does a better job at that. The theme can basically be summed up like this: it is in our nature to become savages, but society is a way in which we've learned to keep those desires in check. However, the transformation of these characters doesn't feel very natural considering the emphasis is on summarizing the story instead of actually building the characters. It's as if the main purpose of the film was to simply get from point A to point B. That is what ultimately hurts this film because the lazy script adaptation doesn't allow us to see that transformation unfold gradually. It all becomes about choosing one leader and following them. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Lord of the Flies
11,Agent10,What a detriment to a great book,5,21 May 2002,"Having been a fan of the book, I thought this film might be a good contemporary adaptation of the novel which struck quite a chord with me. Instead, it was a convoluted mess with little direction and little acting ability. The scenes seemed to be randomly put together, with little semblance of the book's power within the details of this film. Maybe good books shouldn't be adapted into films.",Lord of the Flies
12,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Lord of the Flies (1990),3,29 December 2011,"A shockingly terrible adaptation. All of the pieces might be there on screen, but nothing and I mean NOTHING that makes any sense translates onto screen. It's amazing how someone could miss all of the interesting themes. I'm pretty sure the child actors wrote the script without any understanding of the book. So it starts off with American Military Cadets, rather than prim and proper British Schoolboys. This is the first huge mistake as it completely craps on the transformation that every student goes through. Jack is reduced to a villain. We even here he was bad before getting to the island. The children don't fail at creating a society, they're all just a bunch of disgusting little twerps. Arguing at the slightest little thing. The kids also start with a grown up on the island...I can't even begin to explain how damn stupid that is. It adds literally nothing. The fighter pilot is excised, losing the irony of Piggy praying for a sign from the adult world, only to have an adult killed in war appear. As well as Jack being the villain, Simon's just a weirdo, with every nod toward religion now gone. So what's left? A bunch of horrible children stuck on an island and acting like turds, which they were before they got to the island. Pointless, painful and frustrating.",Lord of the Flies
13,raulfaust,"Good subject, but no.",6,3 May 2011,"You know, the book this film was inspired and it's subject are really interesting. It's a sociology/anthropology class. Instead of cherishing this well made book, the filmmakers seemed to be a little lazy and made the movie without commitment. The actors are okay, but the plot and the development of this story were too superficial.The film basically shows how a society without a punitive power would interact. They didn't approach it very deeply, but they (fortunately) approached the ""Only the power breaks power"" thinking that Monstesquieu said when suggested the separation of powers.About what the kids did to themselves, I personally don't know if that's what would happened if some young boys got lost in an island. I'm not sure if they'd act like they did here, I kept myself thinking about it for hours but got no where. I may ask some professors of mine.",Lord of the Flies
14,bandw,Why was this made?,1,2 December 2012,"I have read Golding's book and seen the 1963 movie. You may ask why I watched this remake and, after suffering through it, I have to ask myself that question. Remakes of excellent movies are always risky, but if you are going to do a remake at least you should aim to create something better, or offer a different and interesting interpretation. This movie does neither, it follows in the footsteps of pretty much all remakes--it is a disaster. The real tragedy is that someone who sees this before reading the book or seeing the 1963 film will be inclined to give a miss to those superior works.For whatever reason major plot points of the book have been reconfigured. This is all well and good if the final result is engaging, but here the changes are a degradation, resulting in a loss of dramatic effect and allegorical meaning. Instead of having proper English schoolboys stranded on the island, the boys here are cadets from some United States military school. The story has been updated from the early 1950s, apparently to sometime in the 1980s judging from the language used, mention of TV series like ""Alf,"" and the talk of being captured by Russians. The main point of Golding's book was to show that even the most civilized English boys (one group among them having been the school choir), can behave savagely when civilization is stripped away. It is less surprising here that boys from a military academy come to behave badly, particularly in the 1980s. Using about every major swear word in the English language, the kids are not at all likable.The acting is sub par, even for kids with little experience. They don't really talk to each other, they just read their lines. There is no spontaneity in their behavior. I have never seen a more pathetic attempt at crying than what is on display here. Chris Furrh is much too much of a pretty boy to be believable as the blackguard Jack.This movie offers a classic example of where color can be markedly inferior to black and white. In this movie, where the focus should be on the kids, they are swallowed up by the lush vegetation. After over forty years I still had vivid memories from the 1963 movie; after only a week I have had few specific memories of this movie.Perhaps the most irritating thing about this production is the obnoxious score. It is exceedingly distracting, constantly drawing your attention to it in trying to make up for lack of any dramatic tension provided by the script. In some of the final scenes the music is a flagrant ripoff of Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring."" If I had not read the book nor seen the classic 1963 movie, I might not be so hard on this, but having had those experiences, it is impossible not to make comparisons, and this falls short. A great effort made to take a step backward.",Lord of the Flies
15,Beta_Gallinger,A few moments of tension in an otherwise dull adaptation,5,31 August 2007,"I saw this adaptation of William Golding's novel several years ago in a high school English class, before I ever read the book or saw the 1963 film. I remember finding it disturbing, but wasn't sure what I thought of it in terms of quality. After reading the book, I watched the first ""Lord of the Flies"" movie, which I had high expectations of. My expectations were not quite met, but it still turned out to be half-decent. After that, I just watched this second adaptation of the story again, and this time, I definitely didn't think much of it.A group of American military students end up in the ocean after their plane crashes, but manage to get on a boat and row to a nearby island, taking the unconscious Captain Benson with them. Once there, Ralph is soon elected as the leader. Unfortunately, keeping everything under control is not easy for Ralph, especially after Captain Benson wakes up one night while the boys are asleep, but is oblivious! The next day, it is unknown where the commander went, but he is assumed dead. After this, Ralph completely loses control over many of the boys, who join the power-hungry Jack, and become very primitive and dangerous with him! If you have read the book and/or seen the 1963 movie, but haven't seen this remake, some parts of that plot description obviously don't ring any bells. You can be sure that the first movie is much more faithful to the book than this one. This version begins differently, with all the boys together from the start, instead of being scattered on the island, and in the book and the first movie, there is no Captain Benson. The characters also use more coarse language, whether that's a big deal to you or not, and you will find other inaccuracies. However, a movie adaptation not being faithful to the book doesn't necessarily ruin it. This version has other problems, such as simply not being very gripping (I found some parts intense, but not enough), and the dialogue is sometimes weak. I also don't know what I think of the way the Piggy in this movie cries. The cinematography here is more professional than in the 1963 version, but that doesn't prevent this 1990 film from being inferior.Some fans of William Golding's 1954 novel do not like the 1963 film, but this second adaptation of the story is clearly less popular, which is understandable, due to some of the things I've mentioned above, as well as other things. If you look at some of the other comments, you will see that many of those who have read the book think even less of this adaptation than I do. Although the first ""Lord of the Flies"" movie is far from perfect in my opinion, it's still a reasonable adaptation. This movie, on the other hand, is not. For strong admirers of the book, I wouldn't expect much of this movie. In fact, you might want to avoid it altogether.",Lord of the Flies
16,bryank-04844,"Still, this 1990 version of 'Lord of the Flies' is a very suspenseful and unyielding look at what pure chaos really is.",7,11 August 2015,"If you're reading this, then I'm sure that at some point in your life, you have either read William Golding's 1954 novel 'The Lord of the Flies' either as required school reading or for fun, or have seen the original adaption on film from 1963, which is currently part of the Criterion Collection. However, my first foray into this world was through this 1990 movie. It wasn't until a few years later that I read the book and saw the original 1963 film.'Lord of the Flies' has been referenced in countless books, magazines, television shows, and other films, where they're usually discussing a group of kids who are unruly and on a path of destruction and death. Needless to say, 'Lord of the Flies' has always been controversial, which it still is today, given the subject matter. This 1990 version is a bit different than its predecessors, as director Harry Hook wanted to give it a more modern appeal to younger audiences. Instead of a group of British choir boys surviving a plane crash in the ocean with no adults, and making their way to a deserted island, this 90's version has a group of young military cadets stranded with one gravely injured adult. It turns the tables a little bit as we get to see an assuming group of boys who might have some skills to survive in a dire situation along with a mental attitude for order and command, turn into something completely frightening and chaotic.It was a smart move on Hook's part here, as well as, making the young survivors American, rather than British. But the big story points are still there. Ralph (a young Balthazar Getty) and Jack (Chris Furrh) are the main leaders of the group of young survivors who turn into enemies, while Piggy (Danuel Pipoly) still acts as the collective groups moral and ethics board, trying to get these wild kids to survive and help, rather than become savage beasts with no rules. Hook wasn't bothered with telling a story with the amount of symbolism or depth here as in the original novel or even the original film. Instead, a captured the pure horror as these kids turned into monsters.The film succeeds in this aspect very well, because we can easily see nowadays that this kind of situation is far to real and hits close to home for most. Another interesting change is that this 1990 film was shot in color. The original film was in black and white, and painted a fairly bleak outlook from the get-go. But here, we have beautiful landscapes and luscious greens for miles, which is the place where these stranded kids go wild, which is an interesting notion in and of itself. How could these kids possibly become the murdering lunatics they are in such a rich and beautiful place? It's fascinating to watch.The young Getty, Furrh, and Pipoly all do a decent job here in their roles. Furrh is menacing for sure throughout, but also makes you believe he is still a scared little boy deep down, while Getty is constantly mixing a variety of emotions in order to stay alive. Then there is poor Pipoly, who does a great job of being the joke of the group who everyone picks on. It's still quite sad to see what that character goes through. Even a young James Badge Dale as Simon turns in a solid performance, however a few of the other kids still needed a week long acting class in certain moments.Still, this 1990 version of 'Lord of the Flies' is a very suspenseful and unyielding look at what pure chaos really is. The gut punch is that it's all young kids going through this and acting out these bizarre and violent behaviors. Needless to say after 25 years, this film still holds up quite well.",Lord of the Flies

19,Rickting,Read the book instead,4,22 November 2014,"Lord Of The Flies is not an enjoyable book, but it's near impossible not to admire it. It's a powerful story but there's good reason why it's studied in so many schools. The second time it's been adapted for film, the black and white 60s version is apparently good but comparing this awful adaptation to the book is like comparing The Mona Lisa to a crayon drawing. This decides to ignore it's source material. The boys are now American. They have an adult with them on the island. Simon's barely in it. The twins are barely in it. The themes of the novel and the various motifs are given little to no attention. The dead pilot is never on the island. The beast encounter is reduced to a boy getting frightened by the adult. The boy's arrive on a raft yet decide not to use it to get off the island again. There are virtually no hunts. The Lord Of The Flies never actually speaks to Simon. Many of the key scenes and hints of savagery are left out. The boys... you get the idea.What were they thinking? The acting for the boys is surprisingly good and it's well photographed but the script is terrible. It's totally lacking in what makes the book so raw and powerful. It doesn't explore themes at all and is just a simple story of boys devolving into savagery. It feels rushed and since it's only 90 minutes long too much of it is missed out. It may be unfair to keep comparing it to the book when books and films are 2 different mediums, but even ignoring the book this isn't a very good drama anyway. The story is a bit dated and therefore perhaps another adaptation wasn't necessary in the first place. The finale is good, and you get the odd powerful moment here and there but there's not a lot of tension as the boys descend into savagery. We all know what's coming and we don't care. Ralph is well played but too soft, Jack is too obsessed with fun, Simon is underutilized and so are Sam and Eric. They pretty much got Piggy right. This is just a bad adaptation all together, even worse than Of Mice And Men (1992). Don't use this film for revision if LOTF is in your exam, as this ignores the book.4/10",Lord of the Flies
20,the amorphousmachine,Both film versions of this book is worth a look! The updated version does it justice too.,7,24 June 2018,"I remember reading William Golding's book back in my youth as well as watching both versions of 'Lord of the Flies', and I actually remember thinking the American version was pretty good. Re-watched it again and my feelings remain the same, but I did forget that the ""monster"" in the movie was actually called the ""beast"" in film, and I was questioning my decision to revisit this film at the beginning of the movie. Checking out IMDB, it's disappointing to see most of the child actors didn't have great careers, except Getty who was prominent in the 90s, and the kid who played Simon resurfaced in 2002 to have career in TV and movies. The film was adequately directed and location felt genuine. For the most part, the acting was pretty good, particularly from Danuel Pipoly who played Piggy. The problem with the updated version is some of the script -particularly at the beginning of the film where I felt wasn't realistic enough to set the premise. Realistically, more kids would be terrified and crying, particularly the younger ones. I also didn't understand the relationship between Ralph and Jack, or the inclusion of the pilot which didn't really gel for me as it established days had passed. I think Jack should have been more antagonistic in the beginning before his metamorphosis into a power-hungry hunter. The script got better as the story developed and I'm glad the film potentially introduced a new audience curiosity for the book. Some great imagery, such as the beach bonfire scene, or smoking out the ""prey"" scene, but the film did have a television movie feel rather than a cinematic one. I personally would recommend both the 1963 version and this one for fans of the book. I give it extra points for a young cast enduring the elements and holding this film together. If you haven't read the book, you should read it, as I plan to hopefully read it again soon.***½ out of *****!",Lord of the Flies

The acting is very bad, none of them act well, none of them give anything like a real performances. The direction is horrible, all the scenes suck, and are horribly put together.

Due to the scope of the story, it is understandable that the characterisation will be unsatisfactory at times. However, the show makes it up with its relatively fast pace, building up momentum quickly to its finale. Many subtle moments in the book were left out in the movie, which would leave viewers familiar with the book feel shortchanged. But it compensates by attempting to make as accurate a portrayal of the book as possible. In other words, the movie is worth the money, but it would be better appreciated if the book was read and understood first, because only then can one imagine the almost impossible task of adapting this book into a 2 hour movie.",Lord of the Flies

26,FrankBooth_DeLarge,I have very mixed feelings about this movie,6,26 June 2005,"When I was in 10th grade, I read the novel Lord of the Flies in English class, and right after that, we watched this movie. I really loved the novel so I was excited about seeing the movie. The novel Lord of the Flies is very provocative. While it stands as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, it also stands as one of the most controversial and frequently banned novels of the century. For a novel of that much greatness, it is hard for a movie to do it any justice.Part of the reason for why Lord of the Flies is a classic and is still read today is because of its theme, which involves kids killing each other. There has always been a sensation and terror about that kind of theme. This movie tries to catch that theme, while it succeeds at being a disturbing movie, it fails at living up to the novel. There is also a lot of symbolism in the novel that isn't really present in the movie as well.The directing in this movie isn't done very well. The beginning of the movie just kind of opens up and never really gives you much background. As the movie goes along, there isn't much of a flow to it. The book had a great flow which kept the story moving, but the movie was pretty choppy, and as you watch it, you don't think the director even cared about keeping the flow of the novel.The child actors aren't much better. The kid who played Ralph was good, as well as the kid who played Jack. The kid who played Piggy was pretty good, but not quite up to par with the other two that I mentioned. The kid who played Piggy fits the description pretty well, and I kind of feel bad for him because his performance in the movie sort of affects how people look at him as a person. All of the other kids in this movie didn't do very well at all.One of the key elements in the novel is done very poorly in the movie. In the novel there is a scene where the kid Simon sees a pig's head on a stick and has a conversation with it. In the movie all that happens is Simon looks at the pig's head and you see a flash of lightning. The director sure expects a heck of a lot out of the audience if he wants them to believe the kid is having a conversation. Another key scene from the novel, Piggy's death, was also done very poorly in the movie. In the novel it was shocking and depressing. In the movie it is depressing that he dies, but the scene looked pretty fake. There are also a few random things that were put into the movie and had not much impact on the story, like the glow stick, and the pilot who survives the crash, unlike the novel.A couple of scenes in the movie are done pretty well. There is one scene where the kids are all gathering around the fire at night and are reenacting a hunt that took place. This scene is done pretty well, but the real key to that scene is the score in the background. The score is pretty good and helps guide the movie at times. At the very end, when the kids see the marine standing on the beach and they realize what they had done, the director did pretty well at showing the kids' emotions over what had gone on at the island. Unfortunately, the ending is very sudden and is over before you would expect it to be.I loved the novel, but I have very mixed feelings about the movie. There are plenty of things in the movie that you will be disappointed by, but there are also some redeeming factors. It is worth watching once, but only if you have read the book. If you haven't read it, this movie will ruin it for you, so read the book first and then see the movie.",Lord of the Flies
27,princebansal1982,Unrealistic and Disappointing,2,8 June 2011,"I have heard a lot about Lord of Flies over the years, both about the book and the film. So, I was eager to make my acquaintance with it. I knew the initial premise and I knew the ending. So what I was looking forward to was good execution. I was expecting a realistic and psychological movie that has good plot and dialogs.Instead I get this piece of crap, whose only purpose is to shock the audience. Well the audience would have been shocked if they had showed this movie in 1950. But it doesn't even have shock value now.It is about a bunch of kids who are marooned on an island. But none of them seem to behave like kids. Some of them are very young, just 7 years old. But they are never afraid. They never cry, nobody wants to go home. Nobody misses mommy. Only one kid misses his favorite TV show, that's it. Life is apparently no struggle as they are easily getting their food. Seriously ? I think a group of adults would be more scared if they were marooned on an island. And the whole monster thing is just bullshit. They approach everything else logically, but there is a monster in the cave.By the way, I was just not aware before how much the basic premise is close to Lost TV Series except that it is just stretched very very long. And even is Lost the adults are more scared when they land on the island than the kids in this movie are.",Lord of the Flies

30,Michael-70,"Dismissed In 1990, This Version Of Lord Of The Flies Holds Up Remarkably Well!",10,23 May 2009,"When the new version of Lord Of The Flies hit screens in 1990, it was critically savaged, mostly for being among that most maligned of film categories, the ""remake"". Lord Of The Flies had already been made into an austere, critically revered, Black & White film in 1963, so an updated version, filmed in color, using American kids instead of British kids was considered a sacrilege.Both film versions of Lord Of The Flies were based on the novel by Nobel prize winning author Sir William Golding and tell the story of a group of boys from a boarding school who end up stranded on a deserted tropical island when their plane crashes. Although they initially try to live with order and rules, it doesn't take long for the boys to descend into savagery. William Golding was a former schoolteacher who dealt with pre-adolescent oiks the same age as his novel's protagonists. I suspect there was a good deal of satisfying revenge in his describing these boys as being nothing more than savages in school uniforms. But Golding was less interested in telling a realistic story than by making his deserted island an allegory for British society but he artificially stacks the deck by making his world all male and by keeping the boys between the ages of 8 and 13, before many of them start having sexual interests. Golding's novel is heavy on symbolism and paints its characters in stark unambiguous terms so Lord Of The Flies can be easily dissected with any intellectual knife, from the ""political"" (Ralph represents Democracy, Jack represents Totalitarianism) to the ""psychological"" (Ralph is the Super Ego, Jack is the Id). Personally, I think this undercuts his most powerful conceit, which is, without adult supervision, how long would it take for a group of young kids to degenerate into anarchy and brutality? In the 1990 version of Lord Of The Flies, the kids are not British, but American and they are from a military academy. This change upsets the purists most of all. Because, if you were determined to show that the British class system is so inherently fragile that it would crumble when confronted with the merest challenge, your theory is kaput if the kids are American.American kids are automatically less uptight than their British counterparts. From the very start they are less willing to group themselves into preconceived social stations. We see this clearly after a conch shell is found and all the boys are called for an assembly.Here, two older boys, each with natural leadership qualities rise to the occasion. Ralph (Balthazar Getty) is the liberal idealist and Jack (Chris Furrh) is the conservative realist and while they are good friends at the start, this soon changes. Their personality differences immediately begin to shape life on the island. Jack focuses on the hedonistic positives; they don't have teachers, classes, tests or any girls to bother them, so why not enjoy this unscheduled vacation a little bit?But Ralph, thinking down the line a bit, knows that there is no way they can stay on this island for the rest of their lives and that if they don't start doing something to get rescued, they might end up doing just do that. This is a marked change from the 1963 version where Ralph and Jack hated each other from the get go. In the earlier film, Jack is a conservative prig, bloviating like a conservative radio host, about how ""the English are the best at everything"" and automatically assuming himself the leader of the boys simply because he's head of the choir. Jack is openly scornful of the election that votes Ralph in as leader and immediately causes a rift by separating his friends into a group of hunters.But, in the 1990 version, Jack is portrayed as a strong young lad with natural charisma. Whereas Ralph can only offer hope that they may be rescued eventually, Jack offers his followers tangible solutions to immediate problems; THEY will hunt for food, THEY will build shelters, THEY will maintain a signal fire. Jack gets the other kids to join his side not by bullying, but by actually providing a viable alternative to Ralph's leadership. Imagine what America would be like if conservatives ever learned that simple lesson!Think about it, in the 1990 version of Lord Of The Flies, since both Ralph and Jack are presented as attractive, competent and intelligent leaders, it is not so easy to assign blame when their island society begins to degenerate. It's difficult to take sides when conservative Jack is not all ""BAD"" and liberal Ralph is not all ""GOOD"". This is bothersome to most people because they prefer their symbolism spelled out for them.Overall, the story has been admirably updated by screenwriter Sara Schiff, her realistic depiction of the boys' descent into savagery is more organic and feels more truthful and less manipulative than the earlier film.So, why did the 1990 Lord Of The Flies get dissed so badly? Perhaps in 1990, there were still people who felt that kids were somehow incorruptible and not prone to violence. Even though history is full of stories about violent children from the Hitler Youth to the Khmer Rouge to the genocide being committed in various African countries today. The belief that a group of young boys would inevitably chuck aside civilization and descend into viciousness may have seemed unthinkable when the book was originally written and the 1963 film was shot. But now, in a post-Columbine, post-9/11 world, it seems amazing that this sort of thing doesn't happen more often.",Lord of the Flies

33,Colonel Ted,Should have worked much better second time around,4,3 February 2000,"As remakes go, this one is not at all bad. As adaptations of classic novels go it is a total misfire. Peter Brook's 1963 was a rather amateurish affair and while this version is far better produced and acted, it fails on account of its script, that makes it ineffective. In the original novel, it was a group of British schoolboys, not army cadets who were castaways on an island. In some ways this makes their descent into savagery more believable, but on the whole it appears to be a tale of already foul-mouthed, psycho kids running amok without the supervision of their parents. The result is film falls down in the footsteps of the previous version, in that it too, fails to give any conveyance of the weighty themes of man's basic evil that Golding tackled in his original novel. It is watchable and entertaining to an extent and director Harry Hook coaxes some good performance from the three leads and his visuals along with Philippe Sarde's score lend the film a haunting quality. But to its detriment, the film remains quite unfaithful to the novel and is ultimately unrewarding, when it really should have worked far better. On wonders why Hollywood updates novels in this way, because the result is always the same: a flop.",Lord of the Flies

36,ItalianBombshell,"A place, lost in time and space-where innocence is lost",7,14 April 2015,"This adaptation of William Golding's chilling novel, that bears the same name, is decidedly American. Although brilliantly acted, this American adaptation of the classic lacks the essence of the novel. The changes are obvious. There was no plane crash, no choir of boys, no symbolism that was the rich undercurrent of the novel.Upon arrival, in a raft that mysteriously disappears after the opening sequence, the boys; seemingly from an American military school, are stranded on an uninhabited island, presumably somewhere in the Pacific. The film moves quickly without allowing the viewer to develop any attachment to any of the boys. The vulgarity used by the boys was superfluous and unnecessary. Further detaching the viewer from the experience by setting them on edge by the verbosity of these boys. The vestige of the Captain? on the island with the boys veers us further from the novel. Although some thought was used to turn this ""last adult"" into Simon 's monster, the delicacy of the situation is manhandled until warped into obscurity. There is no symbolism, no hidden fear of the unknown. The viewer is lead to the conclusion rather than discovering it, as it occurs in the novel. The deaths of Simon and Piggy were almost as an afterthought, rather than chiefly main points. There is no frailty of Piggy, with his restrictive asthma. No idyllic beauty in Simon. The very features that endeared the reader were lost on the viewer who had no connection to the boys. And without doing so, their deaths were just relegated to gratuitous violence. The underdeveloped character of Roger made Piggy's death nonsensical. There was no shattering of the conch. No forethought that Roger was the true evil of the island. The reason the boys followed Jack. The threat of psychotic violence wrapped up in a tween wrapper. Jack and Ralph, albeit most developed characters, were shallow. The child actors portrayed their roles brilliantly. But we're underestimated by screenplay and director. An underlying fault within the entire project. Giving this film such a high ranking was out of love for the story. The enigmatic island, the poor tortured Ralph, and for the loss of innocence.

The carnal desires of man will out, no matter what education, faith or good manners one is grown up with. ""We've tried everything grown ups do. Why didn't it work?"" is the famous line by Piggy in this movie, which was shot in the exotic and hypnotising backgrounds of Hawaii and Jamaica. It is the story that was meant as an allegory for World War II, but still is an allegory for human nature in every way. Man is an animal and the carnal side of man will out, no matter what. It is a beautiful story about Darwin's principal 'Suvrival of the Fittest', even though it is told in biblical images (Baal (Beelzebub) had flies as servants in times of The Philistines.The movie tells us the wonderful tale of human nature, set in a 1990 timeline.

If you go into viewing it with bias as to what it ""must be"" you will probably score it low as a lot of others have. The story line is good. The lead actors are quite good, delivering performances beyond their years that have them coming off as quite fluid and natural. Some of the other performances are strained . . . but I find it quite acceptable that such a troop of young actors would deliver a performance in keeping with their age. Perhaps we the viewers have become so spoiled with astounding performances, we're jaded against simple good performances. While changed up a bit, this is the same classic story of striving for civil order yet having it inevitably fall to struggles of power and ego and fear. Made all the more poignant for having it performed by such a young cast. A huge hats-off to the production crew. Filming with just one or two children and animals is said to be quite the monumental undertaking.

This film has great acting that is better than the acting in the original. In the '63 version, the acting was FINE, but there are some problems: I have to admit that the pretend British accents from Hugh Edwards (Piggy), James Aubrey (Ralph), and Tom Chapin (Jack, and by the way, apparently Chapin's pretend British accent was so bad that they dubbed over his voice! Yep, if you've seen that version, the voice of Jack that you heard ain't Chapin's!) all sound pretty fake. But Balthazar Getty (Ralph), Chris Furrh (Jack), and Daniel Pipoly (Piggy) aren't British and played the roles AMAZINGLY.

It seemed a bit meh.And when something did happen, it only happened because of STUPIDITY.I mean, this film could've been great if instead of killing off a couple characters, they'd slowly kill off the entire cast. That would've been fun.But we ended up with this.Lord of the Flies was a disappointment.I give it a 6/10. I'd give it a 6.5, but I'd have to round up to 7, which is too high, so I give it a 6.",Lord of the Flies
48,shaman1969,I love this movie,7,30 December 2006,I love this movie and I don't know why so many people bag it.I have seen it several times and I actually own a copy.I must confess though that I have never read the novel or seen the original 1963 version.People who have read the novel have said that they found the movie disappointing.Movies are never as good as books.There are always different interpretations in movies and it is sometimes very hard to convey certain elements of a story in a book in a film.Several people have said they thought the acting was terrible.I thought the two lead actors Balthazar Getty(Ralph) and Chris Furrhr(Jack)were excellent and they both played their parts really well.Balthazar Getty is a great actor who I think is very underrated.Okay so they replaced the British kids from the novel with American kids.So what who cares.Its still a great story and the whole point and theme of the story which is to show how children unsupervised by adults can turn into savages and become uncivilized is still there.Also since when was swearing uncivilized?I noticed one reviewer commented on the fact that there was a lot of swearing and that the idea was that the kids were supposed to be polite and civilized before they became uncivilized.If swearing is uncivilized then we must all be because we all do it from time to time.There was not a lot of swearing anyway it was only occasionally.I have certainly seen and heard a lot worse.Get over it.I thought the cinematography was great too.If you like stories involving people stranded on a deserted island as I do then I recommend that you check it out.,Lord of the Flies
49,chevrory,It's a great one but maybe more detail,9,27 October 2019,"This film's one of my faves. This film had great scoring/soundtrack and acting. It did not include some nessacary parts at the beginning that it could have added to be a better movie. Something else that should have been changed was the scene where piggy is killed. Instead of showing the boulder hit his head, it should have cut just as it hit.",Lord of the Flies

The film is a mockery of the book. first it completely rewires so many key elements of the book, and although the book is about British kids who are being sent to Australia to save them from the horrors of war, in this film, they are Americans who are coming home from military school in Australia(?) who should technically all know each other, but they really don't. oh and may I say one thing? There was never an adult on the island. Never! Yet in this movie there is, and well he makes a lot of changes to the book.I'll say ti again, if you liked the book, stay far, far away from this piece of garbage. And if you haven't read the book? Stay away anyways and go read the book.",Lord of the Flies

52,shawshankboy,Underrated Masterpiece,10,17 September 2000,"I can't believe that this movie has recieved such bad reviews, and has only a 5.9 rating.  And the fact that I am the only one to write about this film makes it truly underrated.  When I first saw this movie when I was nine, I was blown away by it. it was the ultimate boy movie for me. The acting was very realistic.  It was about a group of boarding school boys get shipwrecked on an island with no parental supervision.  It showed us how truly savagely and animalistic we can become when their is absolutely no rules or restrictions. And how our survival insticts want to take over. The end was very touching and summed it all up, without any words being spoken.",Lord of the Flies

I think it might have been real difficult to cope with such a numerous cast of boys and the result is really good.",Lord of the Flies
54,Devilsdance911,Not great but reasonably watchable,5,17 December 2009,"I read the novel in tenth grade English class and remember watching both of the movies in class the week after finishing the book, but it had been several years since I'd seen this version and when it came on TV last weekend I decided to watch it.The first thing that I noticed was that so much of the symbolic imagery was either lost or heavily modified, I'm not sure if the writer really understood the story's themes or got the meaning of some of the imagery of the story with important scenes changed and a great deal of the character development was left out entirely which makes the script feels like the cole's notes version of the story.Among the more glaring changes were:In the book Simon was an allegory for Jesus while in the movie he's looked at as being ""weird"", they completely ignored the mystical almost Buddha like qualities of the character. In the book Jack represented the darkness that exists within us all and our hidden desire to pretend to be what we aren't while in this movie he's just an arrogant jerk.In the book the pigs head represented the pure evil of Satan (lord of the flies is a translation from a Hebrew word that literally means the devil)while in this version of the movie it's really just set dressing that does not convey the horror that it's supposed to.In the book Roger starts out as a minor character but slowly builds into being a sadistic psychopath who represents the pure evil that we all possess but control, in this movie he is portrayed as being sick and twisted monster who revels in the pain of others almost right from the start and in the novel he's first described very subtly as being dark (meaning evil not African American)but in this version of the movie he's written as the stereotypical violent black kid. The whole scene of Simon's death was presented in the book in a subtle way as a semi-satanic right (the whole setting was indicative of an ancient pagan right of animal/human sacrifice)while being described as ""accidental"" it's left up to the imagination of the reader as to what happened, in this movie it comes off as being a frenzied accident.In the book Piggy's intellect is the glue that holds Ralph's civilization together, in this movie he 's written to be a whiny simpering sort of buffoon.But the biggest changes that actually hurt the movie the most were a combination of two things first changing the time setting and second making the boys American,The thing that made the novel so shocking was the idea that prim and proper English school boys in the late forties or early fifties could become uncivilized savages capable of horrific acts of brutality and violence committed against each other.Updating the time setting and making the boys American really took away from the shock value of the novel because by the late eighties and early nineties it wasn't so uncommon to hear stories on the evening news about preteen gang bangers shooting people or middle school kids violently attacking each other on the school yard, these factors really desensitized the audience to the violence that the boys are doing to each other in the story and make it much less impactful to the viewer.The acting is alright, it's nothing terribly special but watchable it's obvious that the director wasn't going to pull Oscar winning performances out of the kids but the leads manage to put in convincing performances and bring some life to their characters despite being saddled with a relatively flat script that omits much of the character development from the novel.The direction and photography are good, although the bright lush colors sort of take away from the darkness of the story and make it seem like a tourism Hawaii commercial at times.The negatives slightly outweigh the positives but it's a decent movie and is at least watchable which is more than I can say for some movies today.",Lord of the Flies
55,janberk-04706,Two views in twenty years,6,17 September 2019,"I remember the first time I saw the movie, when I was slightly older than the boys in the story, I was horrified with the violence and really impressed by the ending.

The acting was wonderful, and I'm sure anyone who sees it will agree that that kind of situation is difficult to imagine let alone act out especially with the actors being so young.  I recommend this movie for anyone looking for a creepy survival story.",Lord of the Flies
58,tom_marcham,A good adaptation of a great book.,8,4 November 2001,"Lord Of The Flies was a classic book, which was both an exciting story and a fascinating study of human behaviour. This modern film adaptation, with the British schoolboys replaced by US military cadets, is also very good. The acting is generally good and the main events of the story are portrayed well to maximise the shocking nature of them. You get a good feel for the characters, and the Americanisms are not problematic. I think this is a lot better than the 60s film version, and is easier for young people of today to appreciate. The only thing that keeps it from being a classic film is that it doesn't go into anywhere near the amount of interesting symbolism and psycho-analysis that was present in the book. An enjoyable film, but not as good as the book. 8/10",Lord of the Flies

It proved quite tiresome and disillusioning when you found yourself rooting for the bad guys for lack of better choice.A good idea, ill treated.",Lord of the Flies

If you want something better, look up the 1963 one on YouTube or somewhere else.",Lord of the Flies
61,mattsimdb,Really a good movie,9,15 January 2012,"First of all, I never read the book. Both my older brother and sister read it in middle school, but somehow I missed it. I have been aware of the story for many years though. I am definitely going to go pick up the book now. Furthermore, can anything be more cliché than to pan a movie because it didn't live up to the book. Anyways, I had the luck of going into this movie without that bias.I have read many other books that involve political analysis, such as George Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm. I find these kind of topics fascinating.First of all, I disagree with the people that saw this movie and see it only as ""boys go savage"". It shows that reviewers simply don't understand the deeper level this movie goes to, which is why do people behaved ""civilized"" at all. How does a democracy survive? How do dictatorships happen? What is civilized? How do you make people cooperate?I personally have been in situations, such as adult recreational sports, where I volunteered as a team captain. It's a perfect analogy to Lord Of the Flies, because a team captain has no real authority. I'm not paying people, and I can't kick people off the team, and there are real limits to anything I can do. Every time I have done that there is always some punk that decides he wants to take over, or doesn't have to do what he is told. This happens regardless of how minimally I am trying to dictate anything.So, how do you prevent anarchy? How do you keep from being overthrown? Every society starts out like this. Sure, once someone gets in power there are many people that can't compete with them, but at the top of any hierarchy is competition and relationships. How is order created?So, after I watched this movie I thought, what did Ralph do wrong?Here is my answer. First of all, Ralph should have not created a complete democracy. Instead he should have created a council subgroup of kids that would be elected into their positions. He should have also been elected, and would have easily won in the beginning.By tying the council members positions to his position, they would have supported him in case of any rebellion. True authority is cemented in affiliation. Also, if someone else wanted to take over they would have had a civilized means to do so, next election, and wouldn't have to resort to rebellion.Also, anyone not doing their fair of work on the island would have to be judged before the council. This way his authority would have been enforced through a form of group discipline.Many tribal societies function like this, despite the fact that some might judge them to be ""uncivilized"". In fact, this is also how modern democracy/representative governments work.Jack on the other hand did just about everything right in building his brutal dictatorship. He built his own council out of boys that decided to rebel with him from the beginning. So, he already had his power base. He used fear of the monster to create a constant state of emergency to keep people from questioning his authority. He used violence to keep everyone in line, and he eventually attempted to kill off all his opposition.Stories and movies like this are very important to keep us aware of the way we are manipulated by those who want power. By simplifying the situation they serve as a window to show us how our larger societies function.If you learn anything from this movie at least learn to be suspicious of any political group that cultivates fear in you of outside forces. By making you afraid and convincing you that ""we"" are the ones that can protect you, they are using the oldest trick in the book.",Lord of the Flies
62,prettymaryk,Horrible.,1,1 April 2005,"I read the book a couple of years ago, and found it to be very dark but not by any means boring. Now, we are studying it, and our teacher brought both movies for us to watch. Unfortunately, we watched this one first. Right after the first scene, I knew that this movie would be terrible. None of the actors fit their description, and every single one of them cannot act; not that the script helps. Eery scene is rushed and senseless - I cannot imagine how anyone who has not read the book can understand what's going on. Then there is the fact that they swear. A lot. Believe me, I have nothing against swearing, but the whole point of the book was that these were more or less polite, normal, *British* boys, who turned into monsters in a very short period of time. Here they were so bossy and arrogant already, that it was hard to tell the difference. Jack was made into some sort of ""bad guy"" who ""steals cars"", robbing him of any sort of dignity that he retained in the book even after his descent into monstrosity. Piggy... Piggy had a high, whiny voice, and the sight of him slobbering over his broken glasses was enough to make me sick: another good character wasted. The Piggy in the book, at least, was not stupid. And the scene of his death lacked the horror and the suspense of the book. It is funny how only a few written words can contain more emotion than a five-minute movie scene. Simon's character was also ruined; the most awesome scene in the book was simply not there. Why? And what is with the pilot? His presence took the place of the beast - not a good replacement. The beast itself was barely mentioned. There were two scenes which I somewhat enjoyed - Simon's body floating in the water (not the scene of his death), and the chasing of Ralph through the burning forest - both these scenes take less than a minute. This movie is not worth watching. I suggest you don't.",Lord of the Flies

65,fethullahzeybek,i watched 30 minutes of it and look at the rating i've given it,1,20 July 2011,"i personally think that most of these IMDb users are being far too generous in rating and reviewing this movie. i even think that the people who rated this a 1/10 are being just a little too positive with their reviews. now you're probably wondering if this is the worst movie i've ever seen. the answer is a clear and obvious yes. i'll even go as far as saying that 6.2 rating should be a 2.6 rating. why?the acting is abominable. most definitely the worst i've ever seen. we figure out without any effort of giving it any thought that the actors are doing their job SOLELY for the money.in the thirty minutes of the movie that i watched i found that ALMOST EVERY ELEMENT OF THE STORYLINE was changed. there is a pilot or captain who's not supposed to be there because he's not in the book. We are supposed to see a storyline where everyone except Ralph and Piggy turn into savages. but right from the beginning, they're swearing like there's no tomorrow.the script is what keeps you entertained. it was so dumb and so badly written that it often makes you laugh. a lot of the things they say are dumb and pointless. i don't care about how jack got caught driving a car on a highway.the characters in the movie AWFULLY developed. we're supposed feel remorse for the way in which Piggy is treated, but his character is so badly developed that we can only laugh at his problems.i should also mention the fact that because of the things mentioned above, the director did not even seem to have a clue as to what in the world he was doing. i've seen videos of people making ""little movies"" that are supposed to be scary and they actually seem to know what they're doing, UNLIKE THIS DIRECTOR.now, as for my recommendations, i would certainly recommend viewing this. why? because while watching this movie, you get to laugh at how badly they failed, especially when it comes to script. that's why this movie can pass as a great comedy!i've tried to keep this review fairly simple but ended up having a lot more to say about this movie, and i guess even this review is a bit positive. but oh well, now you know how abominable this movie is. as of now, you can enjoy this nicely made comedy film!",Lord of the Flies
66,rinke1971,What movie lives up to the book?,6,5 August 2006,"Writing this directly after ejecting the DVD, which in turn is about 4 days after reading the book, I can't say much more than what has been said on both sides. The book was excellent... as good as expected, and I read the ""casebook"" version, with all the critiques and interviews at the end. I found the boys they picked to be the lead characters to be very well-selected, except that Jack should've been Ralph and vice versa. In the book, it is Ralph that is tall, fair and well-built. The film didn't harken on much of the deep symbolism that the book unleashes on the reader, as is mentioned with the absence of Simon's conversation with the Lord of the Flies. Simon is a MAIN character to the whole spiritual presence in the story's purpose, him being a Christ-like figure, killed as he is bringing good news (to the tribe that the ""monster"" is only a dead man). Jack is the Satan, or devil, and in the book is the leader of a choir, not an officer in the cadets. It seemed as if the director couldn't get British boys to play in the film, so made them American cadets, had them curse and be ticked-off, and put Marines to rescue them instead of the British Navy. I loved little things in the book like calling the twins ""Samneric"" (Sam and Eric), and the littler boys, ""littluns"". There is no reference to this in the film. Substituting the pilot for the parachutist works out fine for viewers that didn't read the book, and I thought both Piggy and Simon's deaths were adequately portrayed. In all, not a bad translation, but I thought that more could've been done to accurately depict the book's intent. The movie is only 90 minutes long, and another 30 minutes of say, Simon's mystical experiences, and Roger's transformation to executioner would've played well. I guess I'm off to get the '63 version now...",Lord of the Flies
67,samiwhoo,Horrible interpretation of a wonderful novel,1,27 May 2009,"If you have read the book or even seen the 1963 movie, you know how awful this one is. It twists the plot to the point that its structure is completely demolished. It changes the characters almost entirely, both by making them American and military students, but also by making them swear all the time. Jack isn't even the leader of the choir, which is one of his most important character traits from the novel. In fact, the majority of what drives the plot and creates Golding's theme of the evil of savagery and the evil within us is gone in this movie. It was made into a worthless shell of the 1963 movie.If you were aggravated by missing scenes from the 1963 movie, you'll completely hate this movie. 90% of the important scenes are missing the characters are not themselves, and most of the dialogue is changed. Even the pilot is alive for a large part of the movie! I would not recommend for anyone who even remotely enjoyed the book or 1963 movie to see this movie. It WILL ruin it for you. Even as a movie, it is not a good one. The musical score is alright, but the acting doesn't make the movie worth watching.All in all, it's a terrible movie and an abomination of a Lord of the Flies interpretation.",Lord of the Flies

But I find it hard to believe it can be made in a better manner.The ending was very abrupt, and left me breathless for more...it was completely unexpected. But what I loved the most was the storyline. How seemingly normal teens (or preteens), can change in the absence of order. And I realised that it was absolutely true.

71,Hollerbach,Not bad... But 1963 version far superior,4,1 March 2007,"Having read Golding's novel, and being a fan of the original film version I approached this remake with some apprehension. It is flawed, but I wasn't disgusted with the result. It is OK. Doesn't hold a candle to the original, though, which kind of defeats the purpose. Much of the story is the same, and follows the same pattern, of the original, in which scenes, and plot turns are directly from the novel, and which are left out. The strengths of this version lie mostly in the photography, and use of colour. The tropical island, and physical changes are captured well. The opening shots, underwater, are particularly well done. The characterizations are not bad, overall. The chase at the end, is well depicted. The problems with this rendering, however, do tend to outweigh the good points. Most notably- The concept of ""The Beast"", and the more simplified relationships, and characters. In the novel, and 1963 film, there is no Adult survivor. This alters the story altogether, and casts doubt on the motives and actions. It does not work within the framework of the novel. The ""beast"" is meant to be a mystery, to the reader and the viewer. The presence of the wandering ""captain"" establishes from the get-go, that the ""beast"" is human, and in fact the ""captain"". It is doubtful that all the older boys would not make the connection. This in turn ruins the mystery for the viewer. In the novel, and the 1963 film, the ""beast"" (or ""monster"" in this version), is at first a puzzle, subject to conjecture. But initial encounters are presented as quite hair-raising, in no small part due to the knowledge that the boys are alone, on the island. Final confirmation of the nature of the ""beast"", is both gruesome, and terrifying. Despite the obvious fact that it is not supernatural, or actually ""monstrous"". The ""Beast"" is, as discovered by Simon, a downed pilot, possibly from an air battle. Many pilots were MIA during WW2, and the ""Beast"" is one of them, having come down on the island, and entered the cave/grotto through an opening in the canopy. Still strapped to his parachute harness, and clad in a leather flying helmet, goggles, boots and suit, the dead and decomposed airman continues to be animated by the wind, the chute and rigging emitting ominous flapping and groaning noises. The scene of Simon's discovery is both vivid and memorable. In the 1990 version, this is completely abandoned, for the notion of the delirious ""captain"". Some of the symbolism regarding society, and power is left out of this version. Most notably in the treatment of the relationship between Jack and Roger. In the novel, and to a somewhat lesser extent, the 1963 version, the roles of Ralph and Piggy are mirrored by those of Jack and Roger. As Ralph and Piggy rely on each other to maintain civilization, and ""democracy"", Jack and Roger likewise collaborate to bring about totalitarianism. In this version Roger is a relatively minor character, doing little but following the ""chief"". In the novel/original, Jack leads, but relies almost completely upon Roger, the physically strongest boy, to enforce his rule. Roger is quite sociopathic, and as the story progresses, Jack, rather than gaining power, actually loses it. Jack becomes little more than a figurehead, allowing more and more displays of autonomy by Roger. Finally, when Roger kills Piggy, Jack fears not just usurpation, but assassination. Jack is the Dictator, installed by Roger, the military, which becomes increasingly arrogant and violent. It is Roger that encourages Jack to hunt down Ralph, and kill him, although Jack would be content to banish him. Jack can no longer reign in his muscle. All of this is missing from the 1990 version, and replaced with the more streamlined narrative, and reduced characters. Overall, not bad adaptation, and would serve well to inspire to read the novel. However the 1963 version is far superior, and would be more satisfying for those who are familiar with Golding's book.",Lord of the Flies
72,hobitt-21513,Jesus H Christ!,2,28 January 2021,"I was truly shocked that Hollywood had the audacity to rewrite Goldings book into such a fractious, tough son of a gun cliché.
In the book, the group consists of Cathedral choir boys and regular school boys, all British, pre-pubescent, very immature and out of their depth. These original boys had an innocence that eventually turns to brutish tribalism. Chaos and lack of understanding drives the story into an awful animalistic breakdown of order.

73,Da_Piscator,What golding was going for,8,16 February 2006,"Though this movie could of been better in many areas it still fit into what Author William Golding was going for.The transformation of the language in the movie is just to keep up with the time. Does any one believe this movie would gain any respect in this day and age if 9-12 year old children were going ""Wizard!, Wacco!, Doink!."" (Actual quotation from point when they are excited). No of course not (By the way 9-12 year olds enjoy swearing more than any other age group). I know personally I would be laughing all the way through the entire movie, which would not portray the decay of mankind to politely. So, yes they came onto the Island swearing. But if you remember Jack was never innocent. Though he was eviler at certain points, he always had the evil side.I believe other than the fact they were missing Simon's epileptic episode, the movie was a fine representative of the book. The beastie though clearly not a dead parachuter like in the book, still provided the same role as in the book. That is a source of false power to Jack.Though the movie was a bit of a modern adaptation it still provided the same dark and hopeless feel of the book. I personally loved the book, the movie changed a few important events that I feel should of been left in. Either way the movie painted many of the scenes exactly how I imagined them and for that I give them credit. I just hope that if they make a modern adaptation they should be more creative, possibly change the setting, and the characters, but still have a similar plot. That way the audience has to fill in the blanks between the book and the movie so they are in suspense not critization of the dissimilarities between the two.",Lord of the Flies

76,Return2Prague,Striking Film About Authority,8,9 March 2001,"Harry Hook's 1990 film of Sir William Golding's ""Lord Of The Flies"" is a haunting masterpiece.  When I first saw this film in my teenage years, it taught me a valuable lesson about life that I think every individual has to learn.  The value of authority.  Some individuals will never learn about rules and who will govern them until it's too late in life.  This film vividly shows how the group ran by Jack (Chris Furrh) couldn't be controlled until a higher authority stepped in.  In this case, it is the Marines at the end of the film.  Harry Hook's film is a haunting, and meaningful film to watch.",Lord of the Flies
77,totallly-pinkk,many differences from the novel,8,20 November 2006,"The movie was great why better then the original it was more movie like and had less of those annoying long shots in the first one. However this movie was a bit off. In the book there are no adults the fact that an adult is on the island keeps them more in line so its harder for them to be savage which is the whole point of the book. Second Piggy has more dignity in the book and the first movie in this movie he is a blubbering fool. Third The fact that there is some one who is the ""beastie"" ruins that the beast is really themselves and that the beast is just something the have channeled their fear into. forth the boys are originally British boys and the military boys in the movie are really choir boys in the book. The fact their military boys means they have experienced things and are not Innocent. This movie IS good even if you have read the book if you haven't read the book or the original movie it would be even better.

78,Nikodemus26,Loved it!,8,14 June 2007,"If you look beyond the lines in the book, you'll realize that the point of the book isn't necisarily just about kids getting lost on an island, yes, that is the story, but the meaning. The meanings are normal people turning into savages. Look at the time this was written: Just as Europe's fascist dictator's were rising. One meaning is the fall of democracy (Ralph's group) to brutal fascism (Jack's group) after awhile, each kid decides, 'well, everyone else is doing it' and joins Jack's side. I think what Golding was trying to show these kids' savagery. There is a difference of savagery in the 40's (when the book was written) and the 90's (when this movie was made) I think that the swearing just makes it more modern day. And of course this is not for children, neither was the book. It never was meant for children. All in all, I think it was a great movie, though it could've been better.",Lord of the Flies

The book and 1963 movie are great, but this movie really made the story come alive for me.  I wish the boys were still British, but the difference in the stories also made for an interesting remake.  Along with the sexy guys (hey, I'm only 14 I can think these thoughts!) the music and filming really captured a feeling.  The feeling will never leave me...it's just one of those films you can never forget.  I've seen it 6 times, but plan on watching is 600 more!",Lord of the Flies
80,mclanec,does shame to William golding.,1,31 May 2007,"After reading The lord of the flies by William Golding, which became possibly my favorite book, I went out to see how they did with the more recent movie... Huge mistake. All of the symbolism that made the novel amazing was left out in the movie. Even if you haven't read the book you would see some major mistakes, such as forgetting about a raft they used to get to shore (there was never a raft in the novel. The only thing that the movie did correctly was decent casting. To sum this all up I would like to say this movie made William Golding roll in his grave. If you enjoyed the book do not watch this movie. D*MN you Steven Spielberg!",Lord of the Flies
81,chirpling,"""We're not savages, we're English!""",2,18 March 2012,"You may notice that the above line is from the black-and-white 1963 adaptation of William Golding's classic book Lord of the Flies, rather than the 1990 update which I am reviewing. I regret to say that I have not read the book (don't worry, I intend to), but having seen both films, I safely have something to base my opinions on. The 1963 film is described, both by IMDb reviewers and the film's description, as a faithful and brilliant adaptation of the book. Certainly, it was powerful, bold, disturbing and contemplative, offering a range of great acting and filmmaking. If it is any reflection of the book -- and my upcoming opinion applies anyway in terms of film -- then the 1990 film I am (finally) reviewing is utter tacky garbage.I am not going to complain about the contorting of the plot into all sorts of odd shapes, for that is perfectly acceptable if the end result is mildly worthwhile, but in the case of this Lord of the Flies (LotF) it turns out a mess which puts a sour taste in your mouth. Completely it is destroyed, so that even the crucial underlying themes in the film and, for sure, the book are replaced with brash, overspoken, meaningless messages. Nor am I going to be deliberately obtuse and moan about the inappropriate use of profanity in the film. Rather, I will (rightly) point out the quaint Britishness of the original's characters, which gave the film a timely, sophisticated film and underlined the transformation into savages, and then ask you to look at the new LotF's bratty American tweens, who from the outset behave like the kids even kids want to shout at.Instead of the above ""We're not savages!"" and other well-written dialogue, we get a half dozen f-words thrown at each of the cast, dated teen gobbledygook that comes out as annoying and the failing attempts of the writers/directors to give the kids that never-get-it-right ""badass"" look, instead heartlessly Americanising poignant characters with such crude lines as ""Shove his d**k in the conch!"" and ""Shut up, s**thead!"", which culminate in two things. One, the ""savage"" state of the kids not being too different from their normal demeanour, except for violence too over-the-top for kids in a movie which was ignored by adults for starring nothing but kids. Two, mere minutes after the film begins you silently pray to yourselves that these idiots will starve to death as soon as possible.The child actors in this film, unlike those of the 1963 version who acted well and were nicely sympathetic, are plain unlikable and untalented. Although the people who played Jack and Ralph can more or less pass on this front, Piggy in particular has been portrayed as a snivelling, annoying, useless fool who, really, has come out as a crude and over-the-top caricature of the, well, real Piggy. The majority of the rest of the cast are typical plucked-from-in-front-of-the-TV brats (sorry for repeated use of this word). They sit around and their main function in the film is to serve as friction between the leads -- the actors pull this off well, but with a vicious arrogance, playing the role almost as if they are sneering at the people who do fall into this situation, and acting as if they are bullies in a schoolyard (refer to ""Shove his d**k in the conch!"" for an example of this).In the end, it is clear that the badly put out themes are only second to the all-powerful studio machine, which has blatantly tried to run an aged, classic novel through Hollywood and spit out a streetwise, teen-friendly money grabber (again, see ""Shove his d**k in the conch!"") However, the dark themes are constantly at odds with this crude method, dragging it down until the two juxtapose violently upon watching. The violence, again, is far more graphic than the original, depicting with stark nihilism the... you find out for yourself. The end result, a badly acted, cash-grabbing, shameful, overly American, crude, visceral, badly ""hip"" bomb balanced on wobbly, half-hearted gravitas, would be funny if it wasn't so ridiculously shameful.R.I.P.

They really brought the characters alive. People who have read the book and then watched the movie, should just forget the book. Cause a movie is never the same as a book. This movie has: great actors, great music sounds, a good story and good make-up and costumes. The only thing that's bothers me is that the movie is a little short. But the end is just brilliant!

I loved the book, the story was very interesting, unlike anything I've ever read. When we watched the movie, I knew it would be different, but I didn't think it would be THIS different. The story almost completely changes, nothing but the bear bones of the book are left, and it made me sort of angry. It was cartoonish, and lacked any symbolism whatsoever. The book was great because of it, and here it lacks something. I feel that someone who hasn't read the book will laugh, they probably wouldn't understand what is going on. So much of the plot was taken out. The acting is okay though, Balthazar Getty does a good job as Ralph. Despite the boys being American here, he reminded me of the Ralph in the book.",Lord of the Flies
84,bluefrog-5,Ahhhh....my eyes!!,1,3 September 2005,"If you loved the book DO NOT watch this movie. It doesn't even deserve to have its title be Lord of the Flies! It rarely follows the plot of the book, and butchers every single one of the characters Personalities. They make it so Jack starts of as a bad boy who was sent to military school because he stole a car. One of the boys also complains because he is missing the show ALF. ALF wasn't on in 1954! There also is NO symbolism! They even make it so one of the adults is still alive during the first half of the movie.I'm sorry I watched this garbage!

Few weeks ago I saw the film version from 1963 and I liked it much too. A week after that I saw the 1990 version and from the start I didn't like it and I was really disappointed - there were too much differences between this film version and the novel, it seemed to me too vulgar and too brutal... But when I saw it for the second time I really started to like it. The actors are really very good and the film itself is really very quality. In my opinion it's very underrated film and I think it's not fair when everyone says ""it's crap"" just because it's different than a book. Forrest Gump as the film and as the book are also pretty different and nobody says it's crap. I think it's worth to see it and definitely it's not a waste of time.

In the context of  a movie that is so horrifying, it may seem quite inappropriate. But this movie with its picturesque cinematography and spine chilling sound recording, becomes beautiful because it takes one to those recesses of our mind which we shudder to acknowledge the existence of. It disturbs one, makes one uncomfortable... I felt like switching the channels, lowering the volume... anything to prevent me from experiencing the movie or acknowledging how disturbingly close we are and have always been towards unleashing the thinly disguised Dr Jekyll within us... the children behaved as  children do while facing peer pressure, just the consequences were much greater this time.",Lord of the Flies

Oh good lord... this movie. First off, it's very... 90s. That's right, very 90s. I can't really explain what leads me to that first conclusion, but I bet you'll reach it too if you're unfortunate enough to see this terror of a movie. The acting, sucked. The costumes, sucked. (I'm sorry.. they just looked really stupid.) They seemed to think that they'd make the movie better by adding some obscene language, but it only served to make the characters look stupid. I can see if it had been in the book, but why would you ruin perfectly good dialog?! I honestly couldn't stand to watch this movie... I got it on DVD, so I was lucky. I watched the first 10 or so minutes and I got so annoyed with it all, that I just started skipping around in the movie. It *all* sucked. I got really confused too, because there was an adult on the island... that definitely was *not* in the book. They also got all the characters wrong... I just don't know what to say. I honestly can't remember a single scene that I enjoyed watching. So yeah... Please, do yourself a huge favor. Do NOT watch this movie. Watch the 1963 version.

89,joshuaob10,A different Medium,4,10 March 2007,"Film and book are two very different medium's of portraying a story. Plots MUST change in order to suite these opposing medium's. A book will entice or allow one to explore and create the images of a world through their own imagination, thus the images portrayed are purely a creation of the reader's imagination, hence leaving interpretation entirely up to the reader. A film is purely visual, and 'feeds' the images and must attempt to portray an interpretation which the viewer must accept and cannot reject. If we look at many highly sought after film's created by highly prestigious filmmakers, such as Steven Spielberg and ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"", the plot also changes dramatically to prove the film worthy of the portrayal of the story. In the case of Lord of the Flies, I too feel that the film was in a sense 'lacking' a certain presence or charisma, however I thought that the changes in plot were essential in the portrayal of the story through the medium of film. The FILMS characters would have benefited if they had been explored more deeply, so as to allow for more empathy from the viewer, such as Ralph's nostalgic memories or Simons constant graphic nightmares, or the obscene illusion of the Pigs Head conversing with Simon. Also I feel that the film may have benefited greatly from an essence of 'comic relief' which the novel also lacked, and I feel is essential in any story, such as in the works of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"", with the brief but highly effective 'Porter' scene. None of this occurred in the film, which I feel is the main reason for the disappointment experienced amongst the viewers. If one would like to read a book for a story, one should read a book. However if one would like to be in a sense 'fed' a story, then one should watch a film. That is the blatantly austere reason for the term used on films such as Lord of the Flies: ""BASED upon the novel by Sir William Golding"". Therefore I feel it totally unjust of anyone to cast dispersions upon any film for its 'plot differences' between it and its mothering source.",Lord of the Flies

The storyline is loosely based on the book, some dumb lines, but aside from the negatives lies a pretty good movie. I really liked Ralph and Simon as they portrayed their characters well. But the lack of character and plot development may draw quite a few people away from the film. I do wish that the movie was a bit more of a direct depiction of the book, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Piggy got annoying. It was a short film, making it feel almost like the time spent on the island was only about 2 days when in fact it was quite longer in the book. Don't compare the movie to the book. The book is classic, the movie is a decent adaption.

This is too common, I can find movies with similar beginning in every movie stores. I am quite disappointed with this. The children didn't act like their ages. They were just about 6 to 12 years of age but they killed their friends in order to get control of the power. They behave like a group of cold-blooded politicians but not innocent children. It is nonsense. They sound effects were poor. There was no sound emphasized on sadness or happiness. We had to guess the actors' thoughts but not feel their thought by effects. In the last part of the story, almost all the trees burnt but how could they build the fire after Piggy's glass was broken? We will never know. During the fire, the children were all aiming to kill Ralph but they didn't think of putting out the fire! The story ended suddenly after the children chased Ralph out of the burning forest.

Least, but not last, they cut out whole pieces of the book which were extremely relevant to the story, to the message that the author wanted to transmit. Oh yeah, and the ""monster"" ... I couldn't believe that they portrayed the monster in the ""mad"" adult when it should of been a whole lot different. Golding wanted to say that the monster is within them, the children, which from innocence submitted to primal instincts, highlighting the killings that took place.

94,gosslaura,More than just a simple story,10,25 November 2008,"This is a less British version of the book, and not really about children but a metaphor for society as a whole. The children are left to their own devices. At first, the boys form a society that looks out for group and the welfare of all of them. This scheme requires each of them to work and take responsibility for finding the food, and minding the signal fire that is their hope of rescue.Some of the children rebel and go off on their own to create a hunter tribe to satisfy their desire for meat, independence, and power. One by one the other children are drawn to this group out of fear, the need to be with a group and attraction to the strong but evil leader. I think humans are under this same tension even to the detriment of our own survival. Ultimately, we are all looking to be rescued from ourselves.",Lord of the Flies
95,gab_vcor,Can't understand the bashing,7,5 February 2009,"I've just seen the movie and I certainly can't understand why there's so many people hating this movie with so much fervor. I've seen angry comment about them being American and not British, about leaving some things out and putting some things instead. Comments about the hair color of the kids, the skin color of the characters, the variety there is in the film that isn't on the book.Well, if this is about judging an adaptation (or translation or version of the novel), then I believe it's to be expected to have different elements since novels and films are different languages. What we have to see here should be if the message was passed along. Did the money achieve that? We could see how these seemingly educated boys turned into savages, even when a minority tried to do things'as grownups would've done"". I think that wasn't as emphasized as it should've been since the boys seemed a little wild from th beginning, so the change wasn't as shocking, but the message was there. And even if it was lacking some directing skill in making some scenes more moving than they were, it came off pretty well.As I just read today, the idea that books are always better than movies should be one that must be erased. Films are a different thing, even when using novel arguments. There are as many great novels turned into hideous films as hideous novels turned into great films. Sad thing is, is very hard to find great novels turned into great films, but great novels turned into fairly good films aren't as hard. Plus, what's there to lose with an adaptation? ""For the fans of the book, it won't change the love for it. For the ignorants, they'd either be content with the movie or check out the novel"". That was Bazin speaking.So, all in all, it was a fairly good movie, maybe getting some degrees outside of Golding's world and into Hook's world, which is fine since it's HIS movie. Just illustrating the book as it was, as incredible as it is, would be somewhat of an insult since it'll mean that it touched the director so little that he'd have to make a mechanical characterization.Somehow this turned into a book-isn't-necessarily-better-than-the-film comment, but I think it fits to this case. If you liked the book, I recommend to watch the film. Both of them. It's all a matter of sitting and analyzing the motives of the director for changing. Why are they Americans? Check out the time line, the public it was directed to.BTW, I don't know why everyone was so mad about the acting. The children playing Ralph, Jack and Piggy were pretty good, even if they had to play some scenes that didn't entirely convince (the sobbing after the breaking of his glasses?). And the colors were a pro instead of a con, as some pointed out, since it gave realism to the movies and a contrast between a beautiful place and horrible behavior that made the idea of making Hell on Eden all the more understandable.*sigh* All this could be summarized in: 1. Watch the movie, whether you've read the book or not. In the best of cases, you'd want to read it (again, if you're a fan) 2. Stop bitching about differences and similarities and try to understand why were they made and what did they cause.

The acting is pretty good and natural in spite of the fact that they are kids, however we thought that Piggy's death wasn't natural and well presented, because when the rock hits Piggy's head, he takes too long to fall but the majority of the special effects are quite good. The background is very realistic and it was well adapted to the story. The soundtrack wasn't annoying and it was a good choice. One thing that we didn't like was the end because it finished so suddenly that it confuses you and we feel that it should be more clear. We would like to know what happened later.

The plot is good,the setting is absolutely amazing (a desert island) but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. The acting, due to the actors' tender age, is not very good, but acceptable anyway, although the special effects were good, considering the date when the film was made, however the soundtrack was not good, not adding anything to what we know about the film and the worst part of the film was definitely the title...

Howhever, Jack is very mature too, not in the film, but in real life because for a kid to do that kind of role it must be very difficult to hurt his friend and even to kill his friend.One of the biggest criticisms we have about the film is how it ends because we would like to know something more. It sound like they needed to finish and that was an easy way to finish.Overall, we liked the film and if you haven't seen it yet we must tell you that you really should see it, but if you are a very sensitive person, be careful because there are some chocking images.

Also we found the island where the story takes place really beautiful and idyllic, which can attract viewers who like stories with this kind of scenario.On the other hand we found some holes in the plot which made it harder to understand the storyline and some other aspects like the title.This seemed especially wrong to us since after watching the whole movie we had to ask our teacher why this was called ""Lord of the Flies"".The main actors were quite good especially Ralph and Jack, the guy who played Piggy had an annoying voice but he looked cute, so you can stand it.After reading some comments we think that maybe if you read the book you will be very disappointed.

The plot is well developed, but a lot of people say the book is much better. The special effects could be more realists. The end is a bit disappointing, because the arrival to the US should have been showed, and Jack and his group should have explained why Piggy and Simon died to their families.

106,sophie-francis-esj,A good way to spend some time,5,9 March 2010,"I haven't read the book nor have I seen the 1963 film. So, I can say I really enjoyed it because I didn't have hight expectations. The kids were adorable and performed quite well, for their age. The plot is quite reasonable. Nevertheless, I think the special effects leave a lot to be desired.Metaphorically, it showed how a civilization composed of weak people can be influenced by one small rogue group and how the basic personal instinct and interest can overide the basic moral rules. Good food for thought. So, all things considered, it was a good way to spend some time.",Lord of the Flies
107,fat-rudolf,"Challenging novel, but intriguing film...",7,30 March 2003,"Personally, I found the novel quite challenging and quite a hard read. You had to focus on the storyline and concentrate on what was happening, not enjoy what was going on around you.  However, in the film I found it extremely easy to follw both the storyline and how each of the characters was dealing with the certain situation.  I was able to focus on how everything fell into place; everything was just as I imagined.  Although there were a couple of differences that had me startled.  The factor of the captain living on the island with the boys and how they were fully aware that he was in trouble, and quite sick.  I also found it strange and pretty annoying how the movie used American actors, where as in the novel they are portrayed as English school boys.",Lord of the Flies
108,oska,powerful movie,8,7 July 2003,"I saw this movie for the first time late saturday night (it was on TV) and i found it really powerful and disturbing. I have never seen the B&W version but yesterday i read the book and it was really good too.  I understand about the loss of symbolism and the variations from the book but i just remember watching it and feeling really in awe. since i hadn't read the book i didn't have anything to compare it to and i thought it was very well done. getty was excellent, love him. simon was excellent too.  changing it to the academy i think was to cut down the time it would have taken for the boys to get to know each other because they already do.  the show of friendship between jack & ralph at the start was obvious.  in the movie ralph was a much more clean-cut figure than in the book where he bordered the line a bit.  simons death was very dramatic & piggy's was such a giant shock. the swearing i think suited the movie and yes, the imagery and music was great. i would have loved to see what would have happened though, to jack and such.i loved this movie, it's been on my mind since i saw it. however i didn't get the whole whipping part and the relevance of the lord of the flies wasn't obvious.  the whole burning bush thing was great, all full and green then suddenly dead. anyway, you have to imagine how it would have turned out, had a group of girls been stranded on the island.  i'm not sure the content was very believable but it made for an exciting book and movie.  the end expression on ralph's face when he saw the officer and started crying was brilliant. powerful",Lord of the Flies
109,RowerChicka,Not bad,8,21 February 2005,"First of all, I'll agree with the people who said it was a poor adaptation of a classic novel. True, the boys are American, speak profanity, and the pilot is still alive. Big differences that upset eager bookfans. But another complaint is that they never added in Simon's conversation with the 'lord of the flies'. If they'll remember clearly, it was not in the '63 version either. I liked this version better because it was more frighting, and it gave me a better sense of the good vs. evil. The 63 version was more, I don't know...stuffy. These American boys were more up front about the fact that Jack was clearly in charge of his camp and the other boys were being drawn to it like flies to the pig head. The end was more climatic, and I just think it represented Good and Evil better than the 63 version 8/10",Lord of the Flies

111,marinus-2,not great but watchable,6,9 April 2005,"I don't know what it is with all the reviewers who seem to enjoy smashing this Hollywood remake of the 1960s version to pieces. Apparently they can't stand this adaptation for a more modern audience who - like me - found the earlier version technically poor, acted very poorly, and going at a stultifying pace guaranteed to put you to sleep long before the end. Yes, there's maybe a bit too much swearing in this version, and it takes several liberties with the scenario, in sharp contrast to the slavishly faithful earlier adaptation, but my feeling is that many reviewers failed to consider, for one thing, that this is an American adaptation made for an American audience and so, naturally, the Britishness of the story simply had to go out the window. Everyone does what they're best at, right? Having said this, it's time to point out why this version is actually, although far from a masterpiece, not so bad at all, certainly when compared to its predecessor: 1. It's in colour, and technically - sound, camera work, musical score - superior to it2. It still has all the main themes and ideas of the novel despite the changes to the book plot3. While none are for the clearly worse, several changes are actually for the better. Take the 'beast' who in the original comes falling out of the sky. In this one he's actually from among the boys, but unrecognizable, and so fitting in much better with the 'evil inside' theme (Simon: ""what if there's no beast, what if it's just us""?)4. The acting is infinitely better. Jack (and Ralph) may swear a lot but they are - and look - also very natural in their roles compared with the overall stilted acting in the other one. And Piggy - his glasses may be over-sized, but his performance is memorable. He is readily identifiable with, something that the 1963 Piggy never managed to achieve. (BTW It would have been nice to hear the 'dialogue' between Simon and the Lord of the Flies but this would have sounded ridiculous to anyone not acquainted with the book, so it was a wise decision to leave that out in both versions)5. It seems to me that if you really wanted to adapt this novel to the screen and reach a larger audience you'd probably have to compromise even more in terms of authenticity. The story is just damn difficult to transfer, therefore this version does not deserve the kind of 'purist' criticism leveled at it on these pages. It's more entertaining and still thought provoking, and that was likely what the makers set out to create - it would be unfair to expect more than that, and the older version definitely falls short on the first of those counts.",Lord of the Flies
112,coolboi908,-,6,4 March 2005,"i have watched both the 1990 and 1963 version of lord of the flies and i think that the 1963 version is nothing like the newer version. comments about the 1963 version say that is it child porn, i think not. yes there are a few scenes where you can see 2 boys asses and a penis but i don't think that that would be classed as child porn, i went on the net the other day and did some research and i found some pictures, the pictures were showing more nudity then the film was. does anyone no what rules the boys broke whilst on the island? i think that the newer version could have been a bit more longer and that the producer should have followed the first movie.",Lord of the Flies
113,janicelinton89,So inaccurate it's laugh worthy,3,24 March 2014,"No one has pointed out the blatantly obvious mistakes, such as the fact that they turn up with GLOW STICKS, in a raft, with an adult. The book clearly states that there are no adults, so why does this ""Bensen"" end up dying in a cave and becoming the beast? And why are the boys made to be American 'cadets', when they're really British boys being sent away to safety during the war? The plane also crashes on the island, not in the sea. Even Piggy's death is wrong, he was meant to be sent '40 feet into the air', not just bumped on the head by a tiny rock. Before he dies Piggy even wears a watch, yet still wants to 'make a clock'. The entire film is too Americanised and wrongly modernised, and is a very bad influence on those studying the story. The whole thing needs to be re-made, and this time, not by Americans. Boo.",Lord of the Flies
114,jennamustdie,"Lord of the Flies -- enjoyable, but could have been better.",8,27 May 2005,"I personally enjoyed the film, although I did happen to pick up on a few of its deficiencies as well. It was quite different from the book, and I'm not sure the makers of the film picked up on a lot of the dimly appreciated symbolism that the book contains (if you were reading between the lines). I have not seen the original film from the 1960's, so I cannot make any comparison in that regard. But the film differs from the novel in the sense that it does not capture the idea of the ""beast"" that torments the children's minds and is supposedly hiding in the darkness, wherever they are not looking. In the novel, the beast symbolizes the same irrational fear that we all possess -- children and grown-ups alike. It is the same sort of irrational fear that triggers irrational thought, which ultimately is the cause for the deficiencies in society. After reading the book I was somewhat disappointed to find that the film did not quite grasp that concept, nor did it do justice for William Golding's elusive depiction of the wild and selfish nature of human thought. I could blunder on about the film's many faults, but it also has many positive aspects to it as well.I give the Lord of the Flies a rating of 8 out of 10, despite its lack of depth and symbolism. Perhaps this favorable rating can be partially attributed to me being so feverishly smitten with Balthazar Getty (Ralph) and Chris Furrh (Jack Merridew).",Lord of the Flies
115,piratainfiltrado,"A casual chance of creating the perfect society, man and his instinct.",9,3 October 2005,"""Lord of the flies"" is a travel trough the global human spirit, made flesh in a bunch of kids. In the performance of its young actors,and with the brilliant background of William golding's great novel, we can see the world, its primal instincts and reactions. Mankind is drawn in a tragic line, and the ""society"" concept is re evaluated from a sober and clear point of view. In this group of kids we can watch world history, we understand the news that appear on TV. Full of sweetness that always ends ruined by reality,even the bases of religions are shown to us in a pig's head and all the incidents that surround it. ""Lord of the flies"" is a guideline to human behavior, a mirror of ourselves, that makes it easy to understand the world we are living in, by putting it in a far distance and situation, that ends up showing how we are alike",Lord of the Flies
116,kinglightbeing,I hated this,1,15 July 2005,"God, I really hated this movie. I was disturbed by the violence and savagery, the whole thing just seemed so pointless. I did not read the book or see the older version of the movie, nor do I want to now. If the book had any intelligent point to make, it was lost in this movie. It took the ""kids can be cruel"" thing way over the top without explaining itself or even offering us a reason to care. The acting was dismal, and there were so many holes in the story, like the pilot, and I just couldn't figure out the timeline, were they there 2 weeks, 2 month? It couldn't have been much longer, just not enough time for so many kids to go so crazy... I was sorry I saw this.",Lord of the Flies

The movie is alright just on its own, but the book is just on another level that the movie never seems to reach.",Lord of the Flies
