0,TheLittleSongbird,Those gremlins are at it again in this entertaining and underrated sequel,8,10 December 2009,"Okay, the first film is better, but Gremlins 2:The New Batch is a very entertaining sequel that is by far one of the better ones out there. I think it is more of a comedy than the first film was, the original had plenty of comedy and horror and succeeded in both areas. The plot isn't quite as clever or as wonderfully simple as the one in the original, and one or two moments don't quite work. Still, it is very funny thanks to a good script and efficient direction, and the time just flies by before you even know it. And of course the gremlins steal the show, and boy don't they do it well. They are brilliantly designed, if maybe not as scary, and there is a good voice cast. Tony Randall especially is brilliant as Brain Gremlin. The human actors do a great job, with Zach Galligan more appealing here, he was a tad bland in the original, and Keye Luke is simply great in his reprising role as Mr Wing. Christopher Lee is an exceptional actor, and he also does well as Doctor Catheter. And Jerry Goldsmith's music is again very impressive. I do think this sequel is underrated, it isn't perfect but it is well worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
1,bkoganbing,Trouble in Clamp Towers,5,1 July 2017,"A whole lot of the magic of the original Gremlins is kind of lost here in the sequel. But it is a rather timely movie because John Glover's performance as millionaire with an edifice complex among other kinds of complexes Daniel Clamp.Zach Galligan now a yuppie moved to New York City is reunited with Diz the Mowgli of the first Gremlins. Galligan works for Clamp and the warnings about feeding after midnight and exposure to water are not heeded. As a result the gremlins grow and multiply and take over Clamp Towers.Story is substituted for gags in this sequel and as a result it's funny but it also loses its classic stature. I will say this though, one would dearly like to see these gremlins move into the current residences of the mogul tycoon that Glover is modeled on. I'll bet they could do a better job.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
2,Leofwine_draca,"If you're expecting a plot, look elsewhere...",6,24 July 2016,"Joe Dante directs another movie filled with in jokes and references to old horror and science fiction movies, which is a pretty good reason to watch the film if you're a cult movie fan in the first place. Just spotting all of the visual references passes the time pleasingly enough. There isn't a plot but instead the film is full of gags, which is not necessarily a bad thing, in fact it was a pleasure to watch something different for a change.Christopher Lee stars in the film, playing a sinister (what else?) doctor, which is another reason to watch it, and he gets to utter some hilarious lines, such as when he receives a parcel; ""Oh splendid this must be my malaria!"". This is one of Lee's better roles from the period but to be truthful, that isn't saying much. Also on hand are the twins Don and Dan Stanton, who you may remember from TERMINATOR 2, playing two scientist clones. The in-jokes are numerous; Lee appears carrying a pod from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS; THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS is playing at the cinema. Hulk Hogan, the epitome of all that was wrong with the early '90s, even puts in a guest appearance! Robert Picardo, best known to audiences as the holographic doctor in STAR TREK: VOYAGER, plays an unlikeable businessman who forms an unlikely bond with a female gremlin. There are a lot of memorable scenes as well, such as when a gremlin is fed into a shredder, causing one hell of a mess! The spider-gremlin is also very creative and well designed, as is the bat-gremlin. Dick Miller, a Dante and Corman regular, puts in a welcome heroic performance as a man on the street who battles the creatures, and Gizmo even becomes Rambo, tying a bandanna around his head after seeing RAMBO : FIRST BLOD PART II on television! There isn't much plot but it's a fun film to watch. Remember, though, kids, that this is primarily a comedy so if you're looking for horror or plot it would be wise to go elsewhere",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
3,SnoopyStyle,looking for horror and got satire instead,6,15 January 2016,"In NYC, billionaire Daniel Clamp (John Glover) wants to buy out Mr. Wing who is holding up his Chinatown project. Forester (Robert Picardo) runs Clamp's security. After Mr. Wing's death, Gizmo barely escapes the demolition. He is captured and then used by Clamp researcher Dr. Catheter (Christopher Lee). Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) is looking to marry Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates). They both work in the self-contained Clamp Center. Grandpa Fred (Robert Prosky) does a kiddie vampire show for Clamp's TV network.The strange thing about this sequel is that it's going in a different direction. I love the original which is surprisingly scary underneath its family movie facade. This one has a scary spider hybrid. Most of the time, it's having fun with the genre. It's full of modern references and even self-referencing with Leonard Maltin. It's great to have the two leads return for continuity. Overall, the campiness isn't what I want from this franchise but it's still a pretty good time.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
4,mark.waltz,Comedy takes over in an amazingly funny sequel.,7,6 September 2016,"Taking this to New York City and mixing the nasty monsters of Joe Dante's imagination with the nasty kiss butt employees of John Glover's mega billion dollar office complex provided not only a great story and lots of comedy, but made a nice analogy of how monstrous the corporate world can be in efforts to advance. Set literally across the street from where I work on Park Avenue, this shows a different horror in office suites that goes beyond the running out of coffee, back stabbing co-workers or grouchy bosses. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are back, and this time, Ms. Phoebe has a lot more to do. Gone unfortunately are Galligan's parents, but returning are their neighbors, played with small town tourist wide eyed innocence by Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph.This overly proficient and very impersonal office complex has typical over zealous security (lead by a delightfully evil Robert Picardo), an uptight supervisor (the very funny Haviland Morris) with secret lustful feelings towards Zach, a Grandpa Munster like horror movie host (Robert Prosky), Christopher Lee as a weird scientist, and a drunken cooking show hostess, memorably played by the great Kathleen Freeman. There's a lot more comedy, often parodying the whole idea, and playfully making fun of New York all around. In short, there was a lot more imagination put into it with a few inside jokes (including a clever use of the voice of Tony Randall as an intellectual monster) and one that looks suspiciously like a drag queen who takes a shine to Picardo. The Gremlins have more personality this time around too, but gone is the theory that these creatures need to go into some sort of pod in order to reveal their own true colors. They are still as malevolent as ever, but there's a delightful goofiness about each of them that makes each one more endearing, although I'd never want one, even the adorable Gizmo. When they break into ""New York, New York"" (lead by Randall), it becomes all the more hysterical, especially with Prosky's on the side reporter coverage of the goings on. Warner Brothers even spoofs it's own history with several musical numbers and a parody of Busby Berkeley. Any movie that drops a reference to ""Singin' in the Bathtub"" is o.k. in my book.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
5,kosmasp,Summary line may contain spoiler(s) ...,8,23 April 2007,"... that's why I haven't written it above, but here goes: ""Gremlins Redux - Or how to spoof everything you've done in Part 1""It was a high risk the studio took, when they green-lit this movie, but I think they did the right thing! And I thank them for the ... 50 Million Dollars budget they gave ...Dante again as director completely spoofed his first movie. Can't feed the Gremlins after midnight? Western Time or Eastern time and so forth, you heard the jokes in the movie. The ""Why I hate Christmas"" is repeated here, with something else Phoebe hates ... oh and then the film break! I would've loved to be in the theatre when that happened! That was a really brave thing to do! Interestingly enough they filmed another version for the TV version of the film ... but that cinema scene is just great! :o)This comedy/horror, which literally does not take any prisoners (even Gizmo turns ""bad""), is a real treat! And I stand by that!",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
6,gavin6942,A Gift of Love to Horror Fans... and Hulk Hogan,8,23 June 2008,"Years after the original outbreak, Gizmo and the gremlins return... and invade the Clamp building (a parody of Trump Tower). Luckily, Billy and Kate are on hand to stop them again, and Dick Miller is ready to fight them to the death. Now in many assorted varieties (thanks to a genetics lab), the threat is bigger... but the laughs are harder.It's not unusual for horror sequels to become more and more humorous as they go. ""Child's Play"" slowly became a complete joke as the series went on. The same with ""Leprechaun"". With ""Gremlins"", it didn't take long at all -- Joe Dante not only mocks his first film but completely parodies it and turns it inside out. We are treated to an endless barrage of non sequitors, in-jokes, and homages to more than a few dozen movies. Most of the references are obscure (such as Dick Miller killing a gremlin in the same manner as his character Walter Paisley from ""A Bucket of Blood""), but that's what makes the film viewable again and again.Those who loved the first may dislike the second, but those who disliked the first may like the second. That Dante is able to switch gears so smoothly is incredible. With the main characters remaining constant, it should bring appeal from one to the other. How often does a sequel keep the core cast and the director? And dudes, this was during Phoebe Cates' adorably cute phase. Not the sexy seductress of ""Fast Times"", but a dollface you can't say no to.I watched this one right after ""Howling III"" as I was beginning to sober up from drinking Passport Scotch. I switched to Clan MacGregor Scotch, but my belly was full so I didn't drink nearly fast enough. But I think that's quite alright, as ""Gremlins II"" is a timeless classic that should be enjoyed with a clear mind. (But if you want to drink, drink... it won't make the film any worse.) Did I mention Christopher Lee is in here? He is. Why does he have a pod from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""? Who knows! But his role as a scientist (not a mad one) is perfect for him, and a nice change from his Hammer horror roles as Dracula (though we still get a nice blood drinking reference). It might be one of the appearances by Lee I enjoy the most.If you mixed the original ""Gremlins"" with ""Muppets Take Manhattan"" (or maybe ""The Great Muppet Caper""), it would be almost like this. Well, maybe not. I don't know. But if you get the chance to see ""Gremlins II"", see it. You've probably already seen it, though, so why am I telling you to see it? You already know. For that one person who reads this that hasn't seen it, you should. Both horror and non-horror fans will love it. Perfect date movie? Perhaps!",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
7,lee_eisenberg,"Just imagine ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", ""I Dream of Jeannie"", and any Mel Brooks movie all crashing head on into each other, and you've got ""Gremlins 2""!",10,10 November 2005,"Picking up where the original left off, the old Chinese man (Keye Luke) passes away and Mogwai escapes to an office building run by media mogul Daniel Clamp (John Glover), a man strangely resembling Donald Trump - with a bit of Ted Turner mixed in. Meanwhile, Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates) move to New York and come across Mogwai. But by that point, Mogwai has multiplied...and the duplicates are turning into gremlins.Actually, I didn't do a good job describing it there. The movie is a total slapstick comedy. Whereas the original was fairly dark, this one is zany. For starters, some of the gremlins talk. And this time, director Joe Dante decided to poke fun at the media and at the corporate world. To hilarious effect, I might add. Dick Miller (who always appears in Joe Dante's movies) reprises his role as grouchy Murray Futterman, visiting New York and joining in the fight against the gremlins.Anyway, ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" is a hoot. Almost every scene is a spoof of something, and you feel like you're going to die laughing. This movie truly gives sequels a good name.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
8,jboothmillard,Gremlins 2: The New Batch,4,17 June 2005,"Director Joe Dante (The Howling, Small Soldiers) returns with this sequel to the comedy horror that was supposed to be a kids' film, but with too many scary moments it got a 15 certificate, so they did their best to keep this one more family oriented. Basically Mr. Wing (Keye Luke) has died, and his Mogwai, Gizmo, has been captured by the scientific minds inside the genetics lab of a big New York business owned by mogul Daniel Clamp (John Glover). Working in the big office of New York are old friends Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates), and when Billy finds out Gizmo is in the building he is keen to take care of him. Kate is very worried knowing what happened last time when they forgot out the three rules, keep him away from bright lights especially sunlight which kills him, don't get him wet or they multiply, and don't feed them after midnight or they transform. Of course, once again these rules are unintentionally broken, and a new batch of Mogwai, soon to become nasty and ugly Gremlins, are set loose to cause chaos in the building. But the bigger problem with this new litter is that they are slurping their way through the various chemicals in the laboratory, giving hem many abilities, including speech, wings, arachnid qualities, and even stuff that stops their allergic reaction to sunlight. Of course as soon as gets dark outside that is when the Gremlins plan to break out into the city, but the humans have a plan to fool them into thinking it is dark, and in the end, they all get electrocuted to death. Also starring Mrs. Doubtfire's Robert Prosky as Grandpa Fred, Star Trek: Voyager's Robert Picardo as Forster, Howie Mandel as Gizmo, Tony Randall as Brain Gremlin, Sir Christopher Lee as Doctor Catheter, Home Alone 3's Haviland Morris as Marla Bloodstone, Dick Miller as Murray Futterman, Jackie Joseph as Sheila Futterman, Keye Luke as Mr. Wing, Jerry Goldsmith as Yogurt Customer, Leonard Maltin, Police Academy's Bubba Smith and Hulk Hogan. The animatronic and small computer effects for the Gremlin creatures still do reasonably well, I like the fact that the film has in-jokes based on its own predecessor, as well as spoofing many other things, it certainly seems to be more childish, but that's not such a bad thing. Okay!",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
9,ccthemovieman-1,More Humor Makes This A More Appealing Gremlins Film,9,14 April 2006,"When this came out, it was an amazing movie because these Gremlin creatures looked so lifelike. They still look pretty real. What I like best about this film is that it took the hard edge off the first one and made it more of a comedy. To me, this sequel was more entertaining than the first film and one I would watch a lot more times. There are so many jokes and wild scenes in here it would many viewings to catch them all. For movie buffs, it's especially fun with all the references to other films in here.However, it should be pointed out that there are still plenty of scenes where the gremlins are nasty and attack people, so the film is still horror-like in that respect. It may be played for comedic purposes, but these creatures are anything but friendly. In other words, there is still a bit of a hard edge in here for people who want that.After three viewings of this film over the years, the only person who wore thin on me was John Glover's character, ""Daniel Clamp,"" an obvious Donald Trump-imitation but grossly overacted by Glover. He winds up just being too silly.Phoebe Cates and Zach Galligan reprise their roles as the cute, small-town, wholesome (despite not being married, however) couple who live together who, of course, know all about these gremlins.It was nice to see Jackie Joseph (of the original ""Little Shop Of Horrors"") again as well as some other well-known characters such as Christopher Lee, Robert Prosky, Dick Miller and Keye Luke. The film just flies by, which tells you it's entertaining.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
10,Tweekums,More laughs but fewer scares than the first,7,18 January 2012,"It is hard to say if this film is better or worse than the first as the tone is so different; yes they both feature rampaging gremlins but where as the first film had a delightfully nasty streak this one is played almost entirely for laughs. Billy and Kate have left Kingston Falls and now work in the Clamp Tower' a highly automated building in the city of New York. The corporation's next project is a development in China town where, you guessed it; Clamps people get hold of Gizmo and take him to the genetics lab in Clamp Tower. It isn't long before he gets wet and his resultant offspring have a midnight snack and mayhem ensues. To add variety a few of the gremlins go to the genetics lab and drink various concoctions that create new types of gremlins; one is brainy, another can fly and one it turned into electricity! Once again it is up to Billy, Kate and Gizmo to save the day! There may be fewer scares than last time but the increased laugh-out-loud moments make this sequel worth watching. The new types of Gremlins just add to the hilarity; I particularly liked the 'Brain Gremlin' who gave a speech about their desire for civilisation before shooting another gremlin in the face! Other signs or the change of tone include Kate's speech about why she hates Lincoln; in the first film she gives a story about how her father tragically died at Christmas, this time she got flashed of Lincoln's birthday! The change in tone makes this film far more suitable for younger viewers although they probable won't get all the references. Talking of references the film is very self-referential, at one point a critic reviews the first Gremlins film and at another time it looks as if the film has broken down and Hulk Hogan demand that the gremlins in the projection booth restart 'Gremlins 2'.Once again the gremlin effects were great; better than most CGI could achieve today; they may be puppets but they are really there. The acting from the leads was good enough and it was a delight to see veteran horror stay Christopher Lee appearing as the scientist in charge of the lab. Personally I preferred the first film, but it is just a matter of taste; I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the first and it has the advantage that it is more suitable for slightly younger viewers.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
11,BA_Harrison,More demented fun from Joe Dante and his toothy terrors.,9,4 October 2008,"The New Batch sees the welcome return of those mischievous rascals who laid waste to the sleepy town of Kingston Falls in the hit 1984 horror/comedy Gremlinsonly this time, it's New York City that provides the backdrop to the chaos.With director Joe Dante, life-long animation fan and master of macabre humour, once again calling the shots (and working with an even bigger budget), this self-referential, post-modern, and completely manic sequel proves to be more zany than the original, and almost as much fun, delivering non-stop mayhem more than worthy of the Warner Brothers name.The story begins with adorable fuzzball Gizmo the Mogwai left all alone after his owner, the elderly proprietor of a Chinatown antiques store, becomes ill and dies. As the old man's shop is torn down to make way for a modern development, Gizmo leaves, only to be captured by a scientist and taken to Clamp Tower, headquarters of multi-millionaire Daniel Clamp (John Glover); here, he is handed over to geneticist Doctor Catheter (Christopher Lee), who intends to experiment on the poor thing.Fortunately for Gizmo, the high tech building is also the place of work for Billy and Kate (Zach Galligan and the gorgeous Phoebe Cates), his friends from the first film. Billy rescues his furry pal from his cage, intending to take the little fellow home, but the lovable fur-ball accidentally gets wet (a big no-no when it comes to mogwai), and it's not long before the inevitable pitter patter of scaly, clawed feet can be heard all over Clamp Tower.Featuring an animated intro from Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, a comedy interlude featuring Hulk Hogan, genetically modified gremlins (including bat-gremlin, spider-gremlin, and a brainy gremlin), and even a lavish song-and-dance number, The New Batch is supremely silly stuff, but extremely entertaining nonetheless. The script is witty and inventive (there are tons of in-jokes for film fans), and the superb creature effects (a combination of puppetry, stop-motion animation and animatronics) have a charm that would be sorely lacking if they were to be achieved today using modern CGI technology.Completely demented and packed with laughs, Gremlins 2 is irresistible fun for all the family (well, providing your family has a deliciously twisted sense of humour and aren't offended by cartoon-style violence).",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
12,paul_haakonsen,A sequel every bit as enjoyable as the first movie...,7,8 May 2017,"I am, and have always been, a fan of the ""Gremlins"" movies. Especially since they manage to combine comedy and horror in a most satisfying manner, but most importantly because of the Mogwai and the gremlins themselves.If you enjoyed the 1984 ""Gremlins"" movie, then you will definitely also like the ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" from 1990.This is a direct continuation of the first movie in a way, and the writers managed to come up with a story angle that supports the transition between the first and second movie quite well.In ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" Billy (played by Zach Galligan) and Kate (played by Phoebe Cates) have moved to New York and are working for the Clamp company and work in an advanced skyscraper. When Gizmo finds his way to Billy, and is accidentally exposed to water, New York is in for a repeat of the incident that happened at Kingston Falls.One might think, at a glance, that I have already seen this in the first movie. And you are right, to a certain extend. Sure, there are similarities to the first movie, but everything in ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" is taken one step further. More gremlins, more mutations, more mayhem, more comedy, and so forth.What I love about ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" is the great ideas for changing the gremlins, as they are exposed to the various formulas and genetic materials from a research company also house in the Clamp Tower. The gremlins designs are just fantastic, and the creativity behind these ideas is just fabulous.There are also some great performances in this movie. Of course, first and foremost, it was nice to have Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates return to their roles. But it was equally great to have Dick Miller return as well, despite for a small role only (just as in the first movie). Furthermore, there were some memorable performances by Christopher Lee, Robert Prosky, John Glover and Robert Picardo.The storyline in ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" is also good, and it matches the craziness, intensity and the unique style of the first movie very well, and then adds a new element to that.""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" is a movie that you can watch again and again, just like the first movie. And this is one of those types of movies that everyone is familiar with, even if they haven't actually seen the movie. I think that these two movies are definitely something that everyone should take the time to sit down and watch.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
13,Quinoa1984,"""Don't miss Casablanca, now in full color with a happier ending.""",10,11 December 2016,"This movie rocks. Oh, I need to say more? Alright then: this movie rocks so hard that Gizmo has mo choice but to do his little bop-dance to it while the twin scientists bop their heads and Christopher Lee does his best glowering of his career (and this man could glower a statue into submission!) This is Joe Dante and his collaborators going into a throw-all-the-kitchen-sinks-at-the-wall approach, and Gremlins 2: the New Batch is even more of a love letter to B movies and Loony Tunes than the first one; like the Evil Dead movies, the sequel finds its auteurs (lets not forget Spielberg too, and this time Rick Baker does fx work) not really wanting to make a sequel (the studio demanded a follow-up to the #4 box-office hit of 1984), but with final cut at his disposal, under Spielberg's supervision, Dante does a delirious cartoon of a live-action movie. When the gremlins wreak havoc it gives havoc a whole other name. Only one scene, when the new 'Stripe' gremlin leaps out of the board in the control room, is actually scary, but no matter.This is a movie to laugh your ass off to, and as a child you find yourself laughing at things but as an adult the jokes come harder, faster, and you get more of them. While Hulk Hogan may be a little dated, hearing a line like the Casablanca joke (making Clamp a lo of Trump and also a lot of Ted Turner), or the Brainy Gremlin voiced by Tony Randall make mention of Susan Sontag, or the references to the musical Dames and what exactly the movie is that the gremlins sneak into the theater that breaks the 4th wall of the whole movie itself (naked volleyball!) makes this a real treat and a half. Hell, just the scene with the Canadian restaurant (with a chocolate Moose cake!) is a laugh riot, but there's many more scenes where the comedy is with gag after gag after gag. And through all of this you got the return of some of the original cast, with Cates and Miller being most welcome, and John Glover giving a legitimately wonderful performance (comic, but with some humanity) in this time when a Trump mogul seemed... innocent by today's standards.Oh, and Gizmo turning into Rambo... I'm slayed.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
14,BandSAboutMovies,The best sequel ever,10,6 March 2019,"Joe Dante is one of my favorite directors of all time. It could be because he also grew up loving monsters, even writing for the zine Castle of Frankenstein before becoming a bona fide director. Or perhaps it's all the Easter Eggs he puts in his films. It's probably because each barely contains a lunatic zeal, as if they come right out and say, ""I can't believe someone is paying us to make this movie!""The original Gremlins was a big financial success and Warner Brothers wanted Dante to make a sequel right away. However, Dante saw that movie as having a finite end, it was a rough experience making the movie and he only saw the sequel as a way to make money. So Warner Brothers moved on without him, inventing all manner of situations where the Gremlins would end up on Mars or in Las Vegas. Finally, they asked Dante one more time and he asked for triple the budget of the original and complete creative control. He got it. Oh boy, did he.Dante has always felt that too much time has passed between the two films and that the strange cable universe only suggested by this movie has become way too true. Sure, it has. But what I really love about this one is that it tells you right from the beginning that nothing is going to make sense, so just sit back and enjoy it. This is to quote Dante, ""one of the more unconventional studio pictures ever."" It's also probably his most personal film.While this movie begins - after the Looney Tunes intro we'll discuss in a bit - in a very ordinary way, by the end it has completely embraced being a cartoon, made in a world where physics and logic don't apply. What other movie would invite critic Leonard Maltin, who hated the first, to savage that film before the Gremlins murder him?Mr. Wing (Keye Luke, returning for a cameo) is the last hold out in Chinatown, unable to leave his shop of mysteries and allow it to be razed for the new state-of-the-art Clamp Center, the new headquarters of billionaire Ted Turner/Donald Trump hybrid clone Daniel Clamp (John Glover, who makes any movie he appears in instantly better).The elderly man dies and Gizmo ends up becoming the test subject of Dr. Catheter (Christopher Lee, who apologized to Dante for being in The Howling 2) and his team of maniacs. He's soon rescued by the returning Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and his now-fiancee Kate Beringer(Phoebe Cates, who really would have been a perfect giallo actress and now I bet you can't get that idea out of your head either).Clamp ends up meeting Billy, who works in the concept design area, and becomes his friend. That also means that his superior Marla Bloodstone (Haviland Morris, Sixteen Candles, Home Alone) gets attracted to him and starts her pursuit to the consternation of Kate.Meanwhile, Gizmo gets wet all over again and spawns George, Lenny, Daffy and the most insidious of all mogwai, Mohawk. I mean, this guy is evil even before he makes the change. Soon, they're tying up Gizmo and electrocuting him, ripping off his fur and hitting him with toy trains.If you know the rules of the mogwai, of course these bad boys are going to get wet and multiply further, as well as eat after midnight and go full gremlin. It gets even worse when they get into the lab and start trying every formula they can get their hands on, like a mutagen that creates a brainy gremlin voiced by Tony Randall, a vegetable gremlin, an electrical gremlin, a bat gremlin who can't be destroyed by bright light, a spider gremlin and hundreds more.Meanwhile, horror movie host Grandpa Fred (Robert Prosky, The Great Outdoors, Christine) turns into an investigative journalist with the help of Japanese tourist Mr. Katsuji (Gedde Watanabe, who played perhaps the most racist character ever, Long Duck Dong in Sixteen Candles) and the world discovers that monsters have taken over the Clamp building. Also, Murray and Sheila Futterman (Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph) have come to town at exactly the wrong time.There's also a completely bonkers moment where Dante involves you, the audience, in the film. Just like in The Tinger when the titular monster breaks free in the theater, the gremlins take over the projection booth, making shadow puppets and showing the nudie cutie movie Volleyball Holiday. Then, Part Bartel as the manager of the theater enlists Hulk Hogan's help to quell the rebellion of the gremlins. This scene never appeared on home video releases until DVD. That's because in the TV/video version, the gremlins take over your TV and do shadow puppetry over white noise before changing the channels and finding the John Wayne movie Chisum. The Duke forces the gremlins to settle down. Lee's voice here was done by Chad Everett.It's audacious that this was even allowed to happen, as the studio worried that audiences would just leave. Dante countered by having a test screening where people loved this segment. For once, test screening made a better movie!Believe it or not, the original cut was even longer. Executive producer Steven Spielberg claimed that there were too many gremlins and several scenes were cut. Way to keep it fun, Steven!Back to Looney Tunes. Joe Dante talked Chuck Jones into coming out of retirement to animate the opening, which sets the tone for chaos. In fact, instead of the friendly Bugs Bunny introducing the movie, the near-manic Daffy Duck just takes over. In the video version, there is even more of this beginning, including Daffy misspelling the movie as Gremlin Stew and deciding to name it The Return of Super-Daffy Meets Gremlins 2 Part 6: The Movie. This was cut because audiences expected a live-action film and were confused thinking they were watching a cartoon.Daffy even comes back at the end, as Daffy pops in and out making comments before Porky Pig ends the film. He comes back again and takes over for Porky before the Warner Brothers logo smashes him.There are so many crazy secrets in this movie. I'll try and share a few of my favorites.The end of the world tape that Clamp keeps to show when and if that ever happens is based on the very real Armageddon tape that Ted Turner had instructed CNN to create.Sylvester Stallone gave his endorsement for Gizmo to dress up as Rambo.The musical number is stolen nearly shot for shot from the 1934 Busby Berkely musical Dames.Randall Peltzer, Billy's dad, was supposed to return after the gremlins were killed at the end and give to Gizmo his newest invention, a wet-suit to keep him from ever getting wet again. The scene was set, Hoyt Axton was available, but everyone thought the movie was too long and the scene would never be shown, so they didn't shoot it.If you listen to Gizmo speak to people, he doesn't always say their names. He refers to Mr. Wing by his real name Keye Luke. And when he meets John Astin, who plays a janitor, he calls him Gomez.There are music cues from past horror movies used throughout, such as the song from Tarantula when Mohawk transforms into the spider gremlin, the theme from The 'Burbs when the bat gremlin flies away and a Hammer-esque song when Christopher Lee is in his lab.Vectorscope Labs has an office in the Clamp building. That's the company from Dante's Innerspace. Dr. Quatermass also keeps an office there.There's so much to remember here that every time I think I've finished writing this, I think of something else, like the Phantom of the Opera gremlin or the fact that Dick Butkus and Bubba Smith are in the salad bar.Regardless, I love this movie. It continually takes huge bloody bites out of the studio hand that fed it - way after midnight - multiplying and becoming better by the second.

15,Coventry,"And so, it began, eternal skepticism towards sequels",4,21 May 2020,"I remember being 9 years old, in 1990, when the trailer for ""Gremlins 2"" came on television. It was my first acquaintance with the franchise, and shortly after a national television channel also aired the 1984 original. I instantly loved it, as I assume everyone did, and couldn't wait to go and see the sequel on the big screen. Unfortunately, this also marked my first major cinematic disappointment. As much as I worshiped the original classic, that much did I also dislike the sequel, and ever since I never looked forward anymore to sequels. Anticipation turned into skepticism and the overall belief that follow-up's can never live up to the originals.""The New Batch"" typifies, in my humble opinion, everything that makes a sequel inferior. The assumption that a plot isn't required when you've got a successful gimmick, exaggerated self-parody, lead characters depicting a bleaker version of themselves, over-the-top absurd plot-twists and the complete absence of the surprise-effects. For some reason, everything seemingly must be unproportionally bigger. The action is transferred from the delightful small-town USA towards the Big Apple. The young stars Zach Galligan & Phoebe Cates are downgraded to supportive minions, and unsubtly get replaced by greedy business tycoons (John Glover) and ultimately evil scientists (Christopher Lee). The magic is irreversibly gone when Gizmo gets captured in downtown New York (his old Chinese master just dies; period) and ends up in the laboratory of a colorless skyscraper. There isn't even any effort made to repeat that the critter mustn't get wet or be fed after midnight, and the next moment the place is overrun with nastier, meaner and uglier versions of our little Mogwai friend.In the original film, the Gremlins pulled off sardonic little pranks, which was hilarious. In the sequel, pranks apparently aren't good enough. One of the creatures transmits itself through electricity, and another one drinks brain serum and begins to jabber like a New York stockbroker. It's not funny, and quite often I even found it even embarrassing. The only worthwhile moments still are Joe Dante's delicious tributes towards other films, like ""Rambo"" or ""Marathon Man"", and the ever-reliable Dick Miller who reprises his bonkers neighbor role.I never looked at sequels the same way again after ""Gremins 2"", but hey, the world needs all kinds of people. A good friend of mine, for instance, has a bizarre obsession for low-key (horror) sequels. He more abysmal they reputedly are, the more eagerly he seeks them out. Thanks to him, I also occasionally still get to see a sequel that is better than expected.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

When I saw that there was to be this sequel 6 years later I was very pleased indeed. What I hadn't bargained for was the sharpness of the writing and the satirical structure that director Dante laid out for audiences to watch.Focusing very much on the then modern obsessions like tearing things down to build state of the art monstrous complexes, or the need for a better world; be it the laboratory testings for better life forms, or machines to run our lives; Gremlins 2 plays out as a sort of morality tale that sees the creatures themselves as byproducts of the human condition. In true classic creature feature fashion, Dante manages to garner a level of sympathy for the Gremlins. These vile offspring of the offspring are party animals, they have fun, they like to sing and go nuts, they are in short, quite like a stag party on the Costa Del Sol! Throwing in as many film references as it can, Gremlins 2 may have a satirical slant at it's heart, but sure enough the fun from the first film segues nicely into this picture to make this one of the better, and more smarter sequels on the market.And those darn Gremlins are nastier and uglier than ever as well! 8/10",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

But (for very convoluted reasons), Gizmo gets loose in their office building, he gets wet and....I first saw this in a theatre in 1990. About halfway through when the ""humor"" kicked into high gear the guy behind me said, ""This is STUPID!"" He said it a few more times before walking out. I agree with him 100%. Needless sequel to the 1984 original...and this manages to be much worse than the first. Like the original this one gets way too violent at times...there was an absolutely disgusting sequence with a paper shredder here. Also this isn't a horror film like the original. This is a spoof on the first. Unfortunately, there's no plot and zero characterizations. All it is is a truly incredible amount of jokes--sight gags and one-liners going fast and furious. Problem is that they're not funny...at all. I've seen this movie twice and haven't laughed once. Mostly I've rolled my eyes, groaned or have been disgusted at the ""humor"" in this film. Also the constant Warner Bros. product placement got annoying--and what the hell were Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig doing in this?As for the acting--Galligan and Cates are lousy (no shock there), but John Glover is just great as a Donald Trump-like character. He ALMOST got me to smile. Christopher Lee is also on hand to poke fun at his evil roles.On the plus side, the special effects are fantastic--even by today's standards, and the film was full of energy. I didn't like it but I was never bored. But it was too stupid and violent to enjoy. The 3 I'm giving this is generous.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

Clamp is planning on building a brand new Chinatown & so needs Mr. Wing's (Keye Luke) shop, Wing refuses to sell but eventually passes away leaving Gizmo the Mogwai all alone as the bulldozers move in. Two genetic scientist's Martin & Lewis (Don & Dan Stanton) discover Gizmo & take him back to their laboratory in Clamp Towers. By a lucky coincidence once there Gizmo is quickly found by Billy who hides him in his desk, however it's not long before Gizmo gets wet & multiplies into mean spirited Mogwai's. These deliberately break the most important rule of not eating after midnight & it's not long before Clamp Towers is overrun with green, slimy mischievous Gremlins. It's up to Billy, Kate, Gizmo & Clamp to save the day...Directed by Joe Dante Gremlins 2: The New Batch was an attempt to recreate the success of the original Gremlins (1984), I have to admit I was disappointed by this sequel. The script by Charlie Hass to it's credit moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring as something always seems to be happening, however this is not enough as Gremlins 2: The New Batch is far more comedy than horror this time around so forget about any sort of story or meaningful character's. Most of the jokes & visual gags are awful, from the annoyingly unfunny opening featuring Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duck to the idiotic part where the 'film' breaks & Hulk Hogan sitting in a cinema has to threaten the Gremlins to make them start running it again. Gremlins 2: The New Batch is far more light hearted with no real horror & no one dies apart from Christopher Lee, unfortunately. If you are a fan of films in general then Gremlins 2: The New Batch may provide you with some fun as you try to spot all the in-jokes & references, there are loads of the things like a gremlin in a The Phantom of the Opera (1925) mask playing the organ, the way Doctor Catheter is holding an alien pod from Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), the way Gizmo dresses up like Rambo, a bit obviously inspired by The Wizard of Oz (1939) where a gremlin melts while wearing a witches hat & a musical number straight from New York, New York (1977). All these gags & constant stupid send-ups got on my nerve's after a while as Gremlins 2: The New Batch goes from one gremlin gag to another with little regard for the actual story getting in the way. For what it's worth my favourite bits were the part where the gremlins attack film critic Leonard Maltin for panning the first Gremlins film & a cool bit where a half gremlin/half bat smashes out of a window & leaves the Batman symbol outline behind! Some of the genetic gremlin mutants like Brain & the spider gremlin are also pretty cool. In the end it becomes one long somewhat tedious joke & I much prefer the original.Director Dante forgoes any sort of violence or gore & plays the entire film for laughs. As a whole the film doesn't have any great style.With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Gremlins 2: The New Batch is technically excellent as you would expect from a big budget Hollywood film. Despite the absence of CGI the puppet effects are still very impressive & the gremlins themselves are great, music, cinematography & production values are also good. The acting doesn't really matter as none of the human cast matter that much.I was disappointed by Gremlins 2: The New Batch, perhaps I was expecting a slightly darker more horror orientated film but all the stupid jokes & parodies just didn't do anything for me. Having said that it provides sporadic entertainment when it does get something right & it's still definitely worth a watch at least once but it's mainly for kids.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

But, sure enough, Gizmo gets wet and before you know it the Clamp building is crawling with gremlins.Sequel to Gremlins doesn't have as much charming devilry as the first film. This one is much more like a big cartoon with a heavy emphasis on comedy. It's still enjoyable on that level, however. Just temper expectations if you're a big fan of Gremlins. Some of the cast from the first movie returns here and all do fine. There are several new people and I didn't have a problem with most of them. The one that bugged me, however, was Haviland Morris. Her performance was pretty weak (that fake accent -- ugh!) and I just couldn't wait for her to get off my screen. As expected, Rick Baker's gremlins are the real star. He goes all out this time and tops the first film with a variety of gremlins doing all kinds of wacky things. 'Wacky' is the word that best describes this movie. Joe Dante lets his inner Looney Tunes fan go wild here. That won't appeal to everybody. Some will love it, some will hate it, some will be in the middle (like me).

You could say that the movies are foremost being aimed toward children, like Joe Dante often does but that doesn't mean the movie is being too childish, like movies of this sort often tend to be.The movie is still actually pretty lame and simplistic but it doesn't take away any of the movie its entertainment value. This time there are more Gremlins than ever, who also cause more crazier and bigger mayhem than ever before.Still you feel that if the movie would had been a little bit more carefully writing with eye for detail and development this could had been a much better movie. The movie is now being pretty simplistic overall and in the way the story progresses. The movie offers little surprises and mostly just relies on the antics of the evil Gremlins.Also the effect could had been more professional. Sure, this is an early '90's movie but some of the effects are simply below par, even for its time. On the other hand some of the effects are done really well, mostly involving the Gremlins of course.It's foremost really a Gremlins movie. The movie features plenty of them and Gizmo is being cute as always. This however also means that pretty much all of the human characters are being put to the background and stand in the shadows of the movie its little monsters. You can blame this on the movie its lazy writing I think, though it of course at the same time is also what makes the movie an highly entertaining one to watch.It's also fun that the movie stars Christopher Lee. It's one of the earlier movies in which he spoofs his own horror image.Joe Dante understands the genre and also knows his classics. Too bad that none of his movies really ever reached the level of greatness, though he has done his share of well known and appreciated movies. He was once considered to be the next Spielberg but this never really pushed through. Still he is a director who knows how to make a movie entertaining to watch, like he also showed with movies such as ""Innerspace"" and ""Small Soldiers"" for instance.He also often worked with composer Jerry Goldsmith, who with his Gremlins movies scores delivered one of his iconic works.It's a pretty simple and over-the-top crazy movie but its all good fun and entertainment for the entire family!6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

Types including bat wing, spider legs, electric, and even a talking Gremlin. It is a new batch indeed, but the same old story in a different location for chaos. Visual effects are spectacular but story is lacking. Gizmo's home is destroyed and he is taken to Clamp Plaza, owned by a good natured tycoon. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates return as employees at the Plaza and are eventually reunited with Gizmo. Director Joe Dante has fun with the gadgets yet creates virtually the same film. Other than the first Gremlins he also directed The Howling and Piranha. Galligan and Cates are reduced to props who go through the same faze. Dick Miller also returns as the neighbor who is still paranoid over the events of the first film so it is convenient that he will have to face his fear and step up. The only real interesting performance is John Glover who steals scenes as Mr. Clamp who tries to do what's best and is responsible for the few laughs available. Robert Prosky provides amusing as an entertainer who conducts an up and close interview with the gremlin that speaks.

Not only does he put Gizmo through hell (again), but there are joking shots taken at Warner Bros., Leonard Maltin, a cartoonishly draconian corporate culture, and even the 3 Mogwai rules get made fun of. I'm pretty sure this is set in a cutting-edge high-rise just so Dante can delight in trashing the hell out of it.It's probably not as memorable as the first, but I do like a lot of the gags herein. Great mischievous sense of humor (*the theater hijacking was cute). I can see why they never went ahead with a third movie; when Rambo Gizmo takes on a tarantula Gremlin, that's probably as far as you can take this.

They are now in New York City, working at Clamp Industries, headed by Clamp, a spoof on multiple political figures. Anywho. At his new office, Billy finds Gizmo, who has wondered from his home after Mr. Myagi - err, the Chinese man - died in the beginning of the film. He was picked up by some scientists, brought to Clamp, and then escaped to Billy's office, coincidentally. Well, Billy leaves him there for Cates to pick him up later. Unfortunately, Gizmo gets wet, and pretty soon a new breed of Gremlins have taken over the building, including a speaking Gremlin named ""Brain.""""Gremlins 2"" is in no way as clever, fun, or humorous as the original. What is so ironic is that this sequel was supposed to go strictly for laughs, unlike the original, but I didn't laugh half as many times as I did the first time around while watching ""Gremlins.""The jokes are not exactly re-hashed, but they are very dull. Yes, sometimes there are some big laughs, but I really expected more.Zach Galligan seems a little more full of himself in this sequel. Perhaps after the original he found success and figured he was a big shot. Ironically, he is now voicing computer games, and according to his attitude and comments on the DVD commentary with Joe Dante and cast, he seems to still think a lot of himself.Phoebe Cates is more beautiful in this film. She just looked average in the first, but something about her haircut matching her face in this film makes her look cute.Dick Miller, my favorite character - apart from Stripe - from the first film, returns, saying he was only injured by the snow plow. A cheap way of bringing back a character, yes. But I'm glad he's in it - he has more screen time in this film, and that's one good element of the movie.Director Joe Dante obviously had fun making this sequel, but it's nowhere near as good as the original. I'd probably be blaming the director of this film for how mediocre it is, but I can't muster up enough words to accuse Joe Dante, who made the original, that he is a bad director - the first film was excellent.But part of film critique is that you MUST criticize certain aspects of a lousy film, and while ""Gremlins 2"" was in no way a LOUSY movie, it wasn't exactly a winner.Instead of putting thought into this absent-minded sequel, it seems the filmmakers single-handedly cashed in on the original's solid success. Instead of making something highly intelligent and thoughtful, ""Gremlins 2"" comes out as a half-baked, summer sequel, whereas it could have been remembered as something more.""Gremlins 2"" is the kind of movie everyone is talking about before seeing it, and no one is talking about the next day.No, it's not horrible, and it's definitely worth seeing - especially if you're a fan of the original - but it's a major blow to the superior original.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

This movie has more gremlins and them doing mischievous things than the first movie, messing with people and playing mean tricks left and right. The special effects on the monsters were good for the most part (some of the animated sequences does fall flat a little) and the music score was OK. However, the comedic and scary moments turn up flat as much of the acting was pretty goofy, including those of the monsters, and many of the characters acted like clowns, especially the dumb twins and the Media Mogul Daniel Clamp (John Glover). The plot went all over the place and wasn't kept quite together as that in the first movie and there were really no scary or jumpy moments. I wished the story showed more bewilderment and fear from the people who witnessed the gremlins' havoc; but, they just showed casual concern and intrigue.Overall, it's not a very good sequel.

I saw everything and anything, good or bad, mostly horror and action/adventure and sometimes not. Coming off my all-time, and since, favorite movie summer, 1989, I was anxious to have 1990 impress me even more. Sadly, it did not, but one gem that's stuck with me ever since Summer 1990 was Gremlins 2: The New Batch.Admittedly, it's silly, sometimes over-the-top and some of the special effects looked cheesy, even back then, and yetI had a blast almost double than I had for the original.Sure, I know the 1984 Gremlins original is considered a cult-classic and beloved by many, but since I wouldn't have even seen that movie (see my Gremlins review on why, but suffice to say, my mother warned me it was ""satanic"" and I was too young to make my own movie-watching decisions) for a few years following this, I basically grew up with this movie first instead of part one.Also, the comedy – there was 10x more comedy than the original and actually a lot less horror, had me rolling. The homage scenes and props were great and seemed to be multiplied from the original. Further, I loved the adventure and the grandiose of it all – I wouldn't have anything to compare it to since I hadn't at this point seen the original, but from the background story, I could piece together that they made this bigger. And finally, of course, I loved Gizmo, but by far, my favorite character and scenes involved Brian Gremlin, voiced incredibly by Tony Randall.Basically, it's a retelling of the original, but in the Big Apple, specifically a Trump-esque building. Gizmo's back and though milder than his inevitable offspring, he's still mischievous and the original, albeit questionable, ""rules"" involving this ""Mogwai"" creature, are broken again. Hell breaks hilariously loose in the building and our original heroes, who are older, but not surprisingly, look the same as they did when they were ""teens,"" have to stop the madness.It's not groundbreaking and not meant to be deep, but it's a helluva ride and has a ton of cameos and side-characters/actors that I loved, like Kathleen Freeman, their television's ""Microwave Marge,"" the wonderful John Glover, my personal favorite Star Trek Doctor, Robert Picardo, Christopher Lee and Leonard Maltin's mocking himself and the original movie. Brilliant.While it's good to see the original, do not miss this incredibly fun (and funny) follow-up.* * * Final thoughts: Gizmo's still great, with the exception of his bad FX running, and ""Mohawk,"" who replaced ""Stripe"" as the original movie's evil leader, was good, but this movie belongs to Brain Gremlin.

35,FeastMode,my kind of fun,6,24 July 2019,"Fun stupid satirical comedy. makes fun of itself and the first movie. some of the humor seems to have been ahead of its time. the first instance of meta humor i can think of.there was lots of dumb stuff as is standard with old movies. and earlier in the movie a couple of the maguai gremlins went way over the goofiness line and were really annoying. googly eyes and buck teeth. but the second half of the movie was much better, much funnier. addition of some new funny characters. and I WANT GIZMO. he's so awesome.

rambo-gizmo lmao. the funniest part in the movie is when the girl starts talking about how she had a horrible experience on lincoln's birthday. it was making fun of a similar scene about a bad experience she had on christmas in the first movie. they did this during the climax, and her boyfriend interrupted her and said we really don't have time for this. and the story itself was funny.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
36,ElMaruecan82,"Too much distance from the first film at the wrong time, not enough at the right time...",6,17 March 2016,"1989 was a terrific year for sequels as four of them made it in the box-office Top 10, and three of them would actually have sequels. So I guess when Joe Dante was making the second opus of his 1984 hit ""Gremlins"", the results of ""Ghostbusters 2"", ""Lethal Weapon 2"", ""Back to the Future part II"" and on the top of them ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" probably made him believe his ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"", would be a sure lock for a great return of investment. It was not.Maybe 1990 wasn't such a good year for sequels after all still, my jaw dropped when I read that the film only grossed 40 millions of dollars out of a slightly superior budget. I don't think it's a result even the most skeptical critics expected; something happened there, let's call it a disastrous and unfortunate accident, nothing that really speaks bad statements about the film's quality. It wouldn't have meant much either had the film made it in the Top 10, I don't think ""Ghostbusters 2"" was anyway superior to ""Gremlins 2"" but it must have met with the fans' expectations, they had their quartet, Billy Murray's wisecracks, a worthy villain and a larger-than-life last-minute savior so it was worth the ticket and the popcorn box. So what exactly lacked in ""Gremlins 2""? What didn't lack was the leading pair, Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, the cute Gizmo, his evil descendants, including the Mohawk, and the unforgettable three rules that everyone forget. Was there a lack of originality? Not at all, the film does try to play in a different field than the first, starting with the setting. We're not in the Capra-esque Christmas small town but in New-York giant corporate skyscraper, governed by a Donald Trump-like character named Klamp, it's a terrific setting as it defiantly pretends to create a microcosm of the urban post-modern world in a rather confined environment so that it ultimately becomes the Gremlins' ecosystem. Billy and his newlywed wife work together in the building, he's a shy and obedient executive and she's a competent hostess who tries to fit in New York and people's rude manners.The heroes are given more depth and character than in the first film but so are the Gremlins who're not just a generic group of monsters. You have the chief, the goofy one with bulging eyes, one with two visible front teeth, some others will be submitted to genetic transformations including gender-changes, one becomes a spider-hybrid, and another turns into electricity no holds were barred, and we could as well have a Gremlin turning into an apple pie or a rubber duck. Too much fun kill the fun, and it's a pity because one special Gremlin was enough, you know which one I mean: the intellectual sophisticated Gremlin (voiced by Tony Randall) who could finally raise the Gremlins' voices in a more interesting manner than their usually hyena-like giggling that quickly get tiresome. It's a pity that such a scene-stealing character blooms very late in the film, he's one of the things we remember and one of the aspects that subtly hints the sequel's satirical intent.Indeed, ""Gremlins 2"" is not like any sequel. For one thing, it's pretty much aware of its status as a sequel and doesn't try to be a ""Gremlins"" in a building as ""Die Hard 2"" was ""Die Hard"" in an airport. The film mocks its own material by toning down the gruesome violence of the Gremlins and emphasizing the jokes and humorous effects. But whether for the Bugs Bunny vs. Daffy opening and some weird comic moments involving a trap door, there is something desperately obvious in the way the filmmakers tell us this is a comedy and at the end, the good gags are quite lost in the midst of these frantic attempts to take distance from the original. Ultimately, what happens with ""Gremlins 2"" is that it takes too much distance from the first film in the wrong time and not enough in the right time.Just when you expect the film to go a little further in its satirical approach, when you think the brainy Gremlin, after such a puzzling speech about the notion of civilization, will lead the Gremlins to something more transcending than the usual mayhem or chaos, well, then the film gets back to the whole 'kill them' issue and becomes a standard action movie. The problem is that the efforts to make the Gremlins look so unique and different didn't have, to me, the right pay-off. I actually felt sorry to see them being killed in an equally blind way, the evil savage ones just like the goofy ones, I would have just loved to see the brain Gremlin survive, because he actually had something more human than the others. Why let the 'action' devices kill the 'satire' ones? ""Gremlins 2"" is undeniably original, and had better intentions than many more successful sequels, it was also served by a nice supporting cast, many prestigious cameos, from the Looney Tunes to Hulk Hogan, from Christopher Lee to Leonard Matlin, but its self-referential approach must have disrupted a majority of teenage fans who probably didn't get all the references to classic films like ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Marathon Man"". I mentioned that the first movie also suffered from a kind of schizophrenia as it was trying to be a horror-B movie and a 'family' Christmas story, but those were twists in the formats while ""Gremlins 2"" tries to be two different things tone-wise, and it didn't quite succeed although it had some great potential.Three years later, another movie would suffer the same fate, and would be a box-office flop due to a similar misunderstanding, ""Last Action Hero"". These things happen and I guess some movies doesn't get the recognition they deserve. Bad luck.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
37,bowmanblue,Very underrated sequel,9,8 April 2020,"When 'great' sequels are talked about, we often hear about 'Aliens, T2' and 'The Empire Strikes Back.' However, 'Gremlins 2: The New Batch' is seldom mentioned. Okay, so it's not as good as those others, but - as far as sequels go - I feel it's definitely one of those rarities that truly does surpass the original.In case you haven't watched the little green nasties' first outing, then it's about the cutest creature ever created - a 'Mogwi' known as 'Gizmo' - who, despite his adorable nature, is capable of spawning evil semi-clones who then become slimy, green, evil gremlins. The action is now set in a high-rise office block in the big city, rather than a small American town, but, seeing as the building is quickly put into 'lockdown' it all soon becomes quite a claustrophobic affair.As you can probably tell by my opening paragraph, I'm a big fan of the sequel (yes, I enjoyed the original, but I loved this one even more). All the necessary characters return and have evolved naturally and, this time round, the emphasis is more on horror/comedy, rather than the more 'horror-biased' first outing. I guess those who prefer straight horror will see that as a negative, but I thought the daftness of the script/premise in general works better with a healthy dose of self-knowing laughs thrown in. And there are plenty of laughs.It's rare that a script works so well as a comedy. Almost every line is funny and when the script isn't making me smile then the physical humour is. Plus the special effects are great. Yes, you can probably tell now what's anamatronic and blue-screen, but most effects are 'practical' as this was way before CGI became so mainstream.Every character puts in an excellent performance (special nod to Christopher Lee, doing a rare comedic turn - and nailing it at every turn), but the creatures are definitely the 'stars.' They're worth watching the film for and there are few movies that will appeal to such a wide audience as 'Gremlins 2: The New Batch.'If you like comedy-horror and practical effects you really can't go far wrong with this one. Watch it quickly before it gets remade with over-the-top computer-generated effects.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
38,ericstevenson,Spider gremlin!,8,7 May 2018,"This movie actually holds a special place in my heart. I believe when I was really little I saw scenes of this movie with the spider gremlin. Since than, I always used to draw a spider design and I believe I still do. I'm fairly certain I got the design and the spider legs from this movie. Anyway, I'm surprised more people don't like this movie. I will admit that it does have a major fault.I wish they had the gremlins go into more of New York City, but instead they're just confined to this one building. I remember reading Leonard Maltin's review and how funny it was to see him in the actual movie. He was actually friends with Joe Dante and was one of the few people who didn't like the original movie. It's great that he can make fun of himself like this as I admit he's given unfavorable reviews to a lot of great movies. Sometimes the visuals are off, but it's still very creative. It was in fact goofier than the original but I still think it had the spirit. ***",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

40,CuriosityKilledShawn,Underrated sequel,9,4 August 2000,"Fancy some Gremlin Stew? Three underrated sequels came out in 1990. Predator 2, RoboCop 2, and Gremlins 2. I remember waiting in the lobby of a cinema in Orlando, Florida before a screening of Back to the Future 3, looking at the cardboard standees for Gremlins 2 and RoboCop 2 side by side. My 9-year-old self was a HUGE fan of the first movies and staring at a standee taller than me, featuring wonderful artwork, for those sequels was big deal for me. I pity kids nowadays who don't have the attention span to soak up little moments like that.Dante takes everything that was great about Gremlins and cranks it all the way up to a zillion. The original movie was a dark xmas comedy horror with B-movie undertones. The sequel goes so over-the-top it launches itself into the stratosphere and doesn't come back down until the very, very end of the credits. It's just wall-to-wall mayhem with so many in-jokes it'll make your head explode. The movie even attempts to begin as a Looney Tunes cartoon.Gizmo, now back with Mr. Wing, escapes the curiosity shop after the old man dies and is found by a scientist working at Splice of Life, a laboratory located in the Clamp Premiere Regency Trade Centre and Retail Concourse (a big skyscraper in Manhattan). Working in the art department of that skyscraper is Billy Peltzer, hero of the first film. Billy eventually locates and rescues Gizmo, but he gets wet before Billy can take him home, spawning a new generation of cute, fluffy, malevolent Mogwai (Mohawk, Lenny, Edward G. Robinson-lookalike George, and the absolutely mad Daffy). They eat after midnight at a Yoghurt stand in the lobby. The following day the Clamp building, and all of the tenants (from the Archery Channel to the movie print itself, leading to an amusing cameo from Hulk Hogan) are besieged by a horde of gremlins intent on mass destruction and good times at any cost.One can accuse the film of having no story beyond giving the Gremlins a lively backdrop for their wild antics, but when you're having so much fun isn't that what matters most? Goldsmith's score (sadly underrepresented on the 22-year-old Varese Sarabande CD) has a lot more weight second time around, backed-up by a large orchestra and string-based action cues. You'll absolutely love it! Chris Columbus didn't return for this movie, leaving scripting duties to Charlie Haas. He uses the Gremlins and the location to skewer big city culture and satirize business tycoons. John Glover is brilliant as the easily excitable Daniel Clamp, a Donald Trump-like property magnate who has more money and power than he knows what do with.It's amazing that a third Gremlins movie was never made. Despite it now being 22 years since Gremlins 2 and 28 years since the first movie virtually every kid knows what the Gremlins are and are familiar with Gizmo (who may well be the cutest thing that ever existed). It's still a huge cash cow and a recognizable brand, and why Warner never greenlit Gremlins 3 is puzzling to say the absolute least.One last thing. Stay with this film until the end of the credits.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
41,Bored_Dragon,Rarely good sequel,8,14 October 2016,"This one has significantly better effects than the previous and Gremlins are more realistic and scary. From the technical quality point of view, it is definitely a better movie. But it is also a completely different movie and because of taste differences, many will disagree with me on which one is better. While the first movie has a somewhat serious storyline, tells the scary tale with some comic reliefs, the second movie is more parody to the first one than it is its sequel. Yes, the storyline picks up where the first movie left, but the tone of the film is completely different. It is not an '80s light horror type of the movie anymore, it reminds more of the ""Scary Movie"" type of film. It is fast, fun, full of pranks and references to famous fantasy movies and characters, like Batman, Wicked Witch of Oz, and many more. The first one has a much better story, but this one is better produced and more fun.8/10",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
42,The-Sarkologist,"A little better, but not by much",4,23 March 2019,"Apparently I read that they decided to change the movie slightly because of complaints that they had with the first film, namely that it was way too dark. Well, I have to admit that they did lighten the mood up somewhat in this film. The first thing that stood out is that nobody dies - well, not quite because there are a couple of deaths, namely the geneticists. On the other hand, there are a lot more Gremlins in this film that have individual personalities. Oh, and the final battle isn't anywhere near as deadly as the one in the previous film.So, the question really comes down as to whether I actually liked it. Well, no not really, though in a way it is a little better than the original film in that it is, as they suggested, a little more light hearted. I guess one of the things is that the Gremlins seemed to have their own personalities, but that had a lot to do with the fact that they broke into a genetics lab and basically started drinking anything and everything.So, where as the first film was set in a small town (which ironically is exactly the same set that Back to the Future used - I thought it looked familiar) this film is set in the big city. Basically our heroes have scored a job at this massive conglomerate - a part of me thinks that it is supposed to be based upon Trump's corporation, though Trump never had his own television network, though the boss is somewhat eccentric, not that I'd consider Trump to be all that eccentric, though we do need to remember that this film was made back in the eighties.Anyway, it turns out the the old store keeper that had Gizmo as a pet had died leaving Gizmo wandering around lost in New York, that is until a passerby picks him up and takes him to the genetics lab. Well, Billy, the hero from the last film, discovers Gizmo in the genetics lab (he ended up working for Clamp, the owner of the company, as a designer) and sneaks in and hides him on his floor. Well, as is bound to happen, Gizmo gets wet, four more Mogwai pop out of him, and proceed to turn into Gremlins, and we basically can work out what happens from here.Well, in this film the idea is to keep them in the building, but like a lot of other films, killing them the same way here really wouldn't work. Anyway, there is a suggestion that they have all been injected with sunblock, so the whole open the curtains isn't going to work any more (though I was under the impression is was just one of them). Well, they do end up getting rid of them in a rather unusual way.Yet the poor geneticists get the blame when it turns out that they didn't actually do anything wrong. Honestly, Billy, who was the guy that caused all of the problems by taking Gizmo into his office, and then hiding him, without realising that despite how nice and good Gizmo is, he is still going to cause an awful lot of mischeif. Yet, despite the fact that Billy is responsible, the geneticists get the blame, and because they are all killed, or at least the boss is killed, nobody finds out that Billy was the one who caused all the mayhem (and further, everybody seems to have forgotten that escapade down in the basement).Yeah, this film was okay, a little better than the first, and I did enjoy some of the rather weird gremlins that popped up, especially due to all the weird and wonderful things in the genetics lab (though honestly, people don't change their genetic structure simply because they drink something, but that is just a side note), but in the end, it is just another one of those movies.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

45,filipemanuelneto,"Gremlins vs ""Donald Trump"", in a morality lesson's movie",5,26 March 2016,"""Gremlins"", as usually happens with very popular and profitable films, gave rise to a sequel where the whole story of the first film is repeated, giving reason to the old saying according to which we're doomed to repeat the same mistakes until learn with them. This time, however, the monsters are going to storm a skyscraper, home to an important corporation run by an individual who, at first glance, looks like a caricature of Donald Trump. The unfortunate ""mogwai"", a friendly creature who, unwillingly, gives birth to this plague when it's not treated in accordance with strict safety rules, will therefore try to help humans put them down again.The direction and production crew remains basically the same from the first film and the script remains in Chris Columbus hands. Steven Spielberg continues as executive producer, but definitely is no longer needed his help to sell the film: the sweetness of Gizmo and the hilarious tricks of the Gremlins sell for themselves. This film is often labeled a horror comedy, like its predecessor, but I consider it too soft to be horror. Didactic and educational messages from the first film are still present, making it a didactic comedy designed to teach young people. Particularly interesting, however, it's the fact that the monster's target is an impersonal capitalist corporation, similar like many other in our times and more concerned with profits and buildings than human or ethical issues. Is this an implicit morality lesson? Perhaps. See for yourself and gather the family, it's a fun movie and will surely provide many laughs.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

Here, he delivers a sequel to his hit Christmas horror movie ""Gremlins"". When i reviewed it, i found that it was a cartoon that was serious. Honestly, except ""Ghostbusters"", i don't know any other movies that are so borderline between laughs and shrieks! Here's the balance is still there but the family values and country heart are left over for the big city and capitalism. Actually, how many movies say that corporations are dumb management, poor technology, oppression and are money blind? To find that here, it's rather surprising and i think that this was this political consciousness that took aback the audience.Beyond this, the Gremlins are really well done (and CGI can take lesson) and the fun is explosive: the monsters attack their studio, their own film and the previous one, Daffy brings chaos (and great ideas for long, boring, meetings or courses...).Well, the script is full of great ideas and Dante reunites all the good cast from the first movie and Goldsmith is back as well with a great score!

What this unfunny but trying sequel, has going for it are some great performances from bit players, Glover, Lee, Miller, and a redheaded cutie, making the moves on Galligan.

Glover's scenes are great though, putting life into his role, a trait this great character actor has, with all his dine work.

Gremlins 2 is also self-referential, such as when Kate is about to tell another sad story of life, but told she hasn't got time to tell it.Gremlins 2 is much lighter in tone to its predecessor, filled with parodies of other films, particularly Rambo 2 and B-Movies. There is also satirise about the controlling, conformist world of this conglomerate, stamping out all individuality and the security team constantly watching for any infringement of their strict rules. The media is attacked and they are constantly jokes in the background, from the failed technology (reminiscent to Billy's dad's failed inventions) and announcements made to the building.Christopher Lee clearly enjoyed his role as the mad scientist who relished his work and gleeful when he has samples of diseases, be very much a B-Movie character he was known for playing. John Glover too was fun as the eccentric billionaire who is enthusiastic and naive and not an evil tycoon.Gremlins 2: The New Batch is a truly meta sequel, a post-modern deconstruction of sequels which had a really bad name at the time of when it was made. It is self-reference and breaks the fourth wall and it is easy this film can divide people into camps either loving or hating it. It is a funny film for the most part.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
55,kevin_robbins,This is a movie both adults and children can thoroughly enjoy,9,4 May 2021,"Gremlins 2 (1990) is a movie I watched out of my personal collection with my daughter for the first time in a long time. The movie focuses on our small town couple from the first Gremlins movie moving to the big city and running into their old friend, Gizmo, who happens to be trapped in the same building Billy works in. Once again water gets on Gizmo, Gremlins appear, and Billy and Kate will need to work together to ensure they don't spread throughout the city and destroy the planet. This movie is directed by Joe Dante (The Howling) and stars Zach Galligan (Waxwork), Phoebe Cates (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), Christopher Lee (The Wicker Man), Dick Miller (The Terminator), Robert Prosky (Dead Man Walking) and Haviland Morris (Sixteen Candles). This movie is definitely a step below the first film but still epically fun and entertaining. I loved the idea of mixing gremlins with other creatures. The animation, especially for the time, was brilliant and this is a movie both adults and children can thoroughly enjoy. I'd easily score this a 9-9.5/10.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

57,mjneu59,"smarter, faster, funnier than the original",7,24 November 2010,"Those adorable critters and their malicious alter egos are back, in a belated sequel, which dares to do more than simply copy the original. It's actually more of a corrective remake, with Galligan and Cates trading their generic back-lot small town for the hustle of metropolitan Manhattan, where after a deceptively slow start they're reunited with the cuddly Gizmo (the perfect surrogate child) and his/her malevolent offspring. The resulting mayhem doubles as an attack on consumerism and corporate greed, at the expense of a Donald Trump/Ted Turner clone (John Glover) who is less a villain than an innocent, almost childlike fellow victim. The apocalyptic anarchy will be enough to warm any child's heart, but only adults will appreciate the swift, satirical jabs and constant stream of film references, including a parody of the embarrassing soliloquy by Phoebe Cates in the original. At its frenetic best the film shows director Joe Dante in top form.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
58,drqshadow-reviews,Under-Thought and Over-Budgeted,4,6 May 2019,"I don't think anyone would call Gremlins a masterpiece. It worked, often surprisingly well, as a chaotic blend of unrelated genres and unrestrained mayhem, and that was enough. Its sequel, arriving a full six years after the original, is both a spiritual successor and a tonal departure, if that makes any sense. It retains the wicked laughs and playful, no-holds-barred character that made the first so much fun to watch, but completely disregards any shred of nuance. Granted, there's nothing all that subtle about microwaving a slimy green monster until it bursts, a particularly memorable scene from the first film, but by comparison that brand of development seems sophisticated.Gremlins 2 is like a doomed sketch comedy show, all distracted energy and crazy ideas without much focus. We've got mutated Gremlins with only the loosest of explanations (example: a veggie monster who's sampled tomato DNA). There's an ultra-shallow satire of Donald Trump, an out-of-touch media mogul who somehow does an about-face to play one of the story's heroes. Hulk Hogan directly addresses the camera. Grandpa Munster leaves the set of his late-night movie marathon to conduct a live interview with the monsters' leader (this one sipped from a bottle of brain juice, granting him refined tastes, a revolutionary's vision and a British accent). It's just way, way too much; dozens of patches to cover for a rather simple, stupid script.One caveat: it's hidden behind the crush of outrageous ideas and unhinged madness, but the film boasts a sharp sense of humor that regularly caught me by surprise. There's some genuinely witty, laugh-worthy material here, and that merits mention. Otherwise, consider this a case study for unnecessary sequels.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
59,snoozejonc,"Strong and hilarious sequel, but not as loved as the classic original",8,30 July 2020,"Gremlins infest the downtown Manhattan skyscraper where Billy Peltzer works as a corporate artist.This is a strong sequel that almost reaches the heights of the original with a new backdrop hosting a repeat of the mayhem witnessed in Kingston Falls.Similar themes are explored with a bit more emphasis on the modern world's obsession with technology and gadgetry. The Clamp Centre contains state of the art (late 80s) tech in every doorway, elevator, office and bathroom. The building soon acquires a new 'Gizmo' that produces hoards of gremlins looking to infest everything with hilarious consequences.The script has a completely different tone to the original. It lacks the strong narrative, is not as dark, is sharper in humour and far more self-referential. All this is serves it well as a sequel when sometimes a new take on characters and a particular cinematic universe is required. It's strongest asset is the humour, as the jokes really fly at you thick and fast.Returning characters are used effectively with their previous experience giving them a logical place as main protagonists. New characters played by John Glover, Robert Picardo, Haviland Morris, Robert Prosky and Christopher Lee contribute with some very memorable moments. John Glover in particular as the Donald Trump caricature Daniel Clamp gives us a focal point of satire for things the Gremlins franchise loves to target like corporate greed, control of nature and megalomania.Now for the Gremlins and Mogwai. I found the original hoard quite scary within the film's dark tone and suspense. This time they are a lot funnier as they jump from one gag to the next. My personal favourite is the scene with Kate in the elevator when she uses the voice activation to 'sound alarm' and they respond in unison. Oh and Gizmo is just as cute and heroic as ever.If I was to nitpick I'd say the basic plot relies on your acceptance of some pretty big coincidences and I personally found the scenes in the genetics lab to be a bit too silly at some points. However, these are not major issues but they cause me to think of the original and how I loved practically every aspect of the film not just the jokes.For me a 7.5/10 but I round upwards.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

The main source of humour this time is when the slimy ""Gremlins"" get hold of the building's genetic lab and change into some very unusual things, including 'bat-Gremlin', 'spider-Gremlin' and 'brainy-Gremlin' (a very funny character with voice by Tony Randall).The cast are again mostly resigned to the background except for a wonderful performance from John Glover as the wacky entrepreneur Clamp.

Gizzmo is sufficiently cute again, and the Gremlins nasty enough, while John Glover's fabulously off beat Clamp is a must and every bit as good as the rest of this film.

65,ShootingShark,Thoroughly Deranged Comic-Horror Sequel With The Gremlins Loose In An NYC Skyscraper,7,26 February 2006,"Billy and Kate have moved to New York City, where they work for big-time tycoon Daniel Clamp in his super-futuristic skyscraper. Billy discovers that Gizmo is being held in a genetics lab in the building and rescues him but inevitably disaster strikes and soon an army of gremlins are rampaging through the building, waiting for nightfall so they can do some good old New York sightseeing. Can Billy and his friends stop them ?This hilarious sequel doesn't really work as a dramatic movie because it sort of breaks down about halfway through into a series of completely insane scenes (like Nightbreed or Weekend). However, if you can get past that, it is one of the most gloriously satirical, goofy, eye-popping, self-deprecating, completely nutty films ever made. Dante was given a blank cheque by Warner Brothers to make a sequel and he, producer Mike Finnell and writer Charlie Haas created the closest thing to a live action cartoon, in which they take adolescent potshots at anything that sprung to mind. Its chief target is corporate big business (the Clamp building is a disaster zone where nothing works even before the gremlins start destroying it and the employees are treated like cattle) but cable TV, health food, movie sequels and critics (Leonard Maltin gets killed, woohoo !), tacky restaurants, tourism and genetic research (Christopher Lee's lab is called Splice O'Life) are all mercilessly laid into. The special effects, by the great Rick Baker, probably constitute the most amazing puppet-show ever conceived (the only contenders being Jim Henson's movies); Gizmo is incredibly expressive, walks, dances, clambers around and pulls off whole dramatic scenes by himself, and we have hundreds of standard gremlins, plus a Mohawk gremlin, a Brain gremlin, a Gargoyle gremlin, an Electric gremlin, a Giant Spider gremlin, all of whom are simply stunning. The scale of the effects work is just dazzling, as is James Spencer's incredible production design work on the Clamp building, which is alternately inspiring and horrifying, and there is a great little cartoon by Chuck Jones which bookends the movie. The large cast are adorable - no movie stars, just funny, talented actors giving their all in the face of the craziness. Galligan and Cates are great again (don't miss the bit where she spoofs her Why I Hate Christmas speech from the original), Prosky is sensational as Grandpa Fred, the caped horror-host with more serious journalistic aspirations, wild-looking orange-haired Morris gives probably the definitive yuppie performance of the era, Glover has a lot of fun playing the Donald Trump caricature as an aw-shucks Big Kid, Lee is truly wonderful as the much put-upon Dr Catheter, Picardo suffers even more indignities than usual in one of Dante's films, Keye Luke, Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph all reprise their roles from the original, and there are a whole host of great bit players, notably John Astin, Belinda Balaski, Paul Bartel, Rick DuCommun, Henry Gibson, Archie Hahn, Hulk Hogan, Kenneth Tobey and even Dante himself, as Grandpa Fred's TV director. I prefaced this review by noting that if you want to watch a regular movie you should avoid this, but it really is unmissable, for one scene in particular, where the gremlins literally break the movie and replace it with a fifties nudie-cutie. This set-piece is, in my opinion, the craziest and most daring gag I've ever seen in a movie. A riot.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
66,PredragReviews,"""Just rabies! I've got rabies!""",8,20 May 2016,"This is brilliant! Fans of the original will love it, but this movie is original and hilarious enough to appeal to anyone. It makes fun of the originals, satirizes many aspects of civilization and human behavior, and makes fun of sequels in general and in the process becomes one of the best sequels I have ever seen! Those crazy flesh-eating marsupials branch out from just tormenting small towns and promote themselves to the big-time New York City. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates return to take on the fiendish ghouls as they invade and terrorize the futuristic New York City high-rise that Billy Peltzer (Galligan) works.The comedic elements are definitely superior, and the concept of giving each gremlin a distinct personality is immediately winning, the ""brain"" gremlin and the crazy loose-cannon gremlin being especially hilarious. ""Gremlins 2"" doesn't take it's attempt at a sequel seriously at all, which given how the title characters act (even in the first one) shouldn't be a surprise at all. With the filmmaker given a big sandbox to play in, ""Gremlins 2"" ranks as the most decidedly ""Dante"" of all of the director's films. The self-satirical humor, manic pace, colorful effects and zany tone resemble a live-action cartoon, and the director appropriately opens the film with a Chuck Jones-animated segment starring Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, setting viewers up for something less serious, and more playful, than the original.

68,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Gremlins 2: The New Batch""- A brilliant satire and self-parody filled to burst with clever commentary and hilarious humor.",8,6 November 2016,"I have something of an odd history with director Joe Dante's 1990 release ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch."" Having been born in the late 80's, I grew up in ""Gremlins""-mania. The original classic of black humor and creature-feature thrills was everywhere... everyone loved it and everyone loved to watch it constantly. And as a young child, as much as I loved that brilliant first film, I equally loved it's twisted and demented follow up. I'd watch them back-to- back practically once a week when I was in Elementary school. They just worked so well together in my mind: a more subtle first film followed by a more over-the-top and in-your-face sequel chocked full of constant gags and twists. Then, about age 10 or 11, I stopped enjoying it. It's radical tonal departure from the original and seeming discontent with its predecessor just didn't sit well with me... it seemed so insane and ridiculous, I just stopped loving it. It felt too much like it was making fun of the original rather than honoring it, which I hated. It wasn't until many years later, as a teen about to enter my 20's that I rediscovered it and gave it a chance...and I loved it more than I had ever imagined I would! And even to this day, my adoration for it continues to grow. Why? Because I realized those things I hated about it years prior were intentional. It was all part of the insane and all-encompassing sense of anarchy director Joe Dante was crafting with this wonderful sequel. I just wasn't mature enough to be in on the gag, and realize that this wasn't just a sequel- it was a brilliant satire filled with great themes based on American culture of the 90's, consumerism and media... and also just a darned well- constructed piece of self-parody. It's poking fun at its own existence as an unnecessary sequel to a self-contained film and just has fun using the concept as an excuse to deliver some biting commentary. And I do think that it may be one of the greatest under-appreciated sequels ever made.Several years after the events of the original, Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and his girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates) have re-located to New York City and are both working for Clamp Enterprises, a company run by eccentric and amusingly naive millionaire Daniel Clamp. (John Glover) Coincidentally, it turns out that Gizmo- the adorable Mogwai- is being held captive for experimentation in the very same building. Soon enough, Billy and his former pet are reunited. But all is not well- an accident causes a new batch of Gremlins to emerge, and it's up to Billy, Kate, Gizmo, Clamp and the visiting Futtermans (Dick Miller, Jackie Joseph) to save the day once again.Director Dante, along with screenwriter Charles S. Haas craft a deliciously subversive tale that builds off of what came before, but takes it in a wildly creative new direction. Story goes that Dante was simply not interested in making another ""Gremlins"", especially as every script that was turned in was just a carbon-copy of the original. It wasn't until he was given near full creative control that he stepped back into the director's chair. And thank the lord he did. From the opening minute of the film, you know you're in for something very unique. And almost each and every scene has some layer of parody, satire or commentary that will leave you howling with laughter. You know you're watching something special when there's an uproariously funny gag involving a cable network's ""End of Civilization"" video announcement being prepped to air and a prolonged sequence where a janitor bemoans the dog-eat-dog world of modern employment while Gizmo is besieged by his evil Mogwai offspring. Special props also go to the brilliant series of gags revolving around Clamp's decidedly inefficient ""smart"" building and a sequence that openly mocks the ""three rules"" established in the first film. There's some good, broad humor there.Beyond that, the rest of the production is just magnificent. The updated creature effects courtesy Rick Baker are a massive step-up, with each and every Gremlin and Mogwai seeming to have their own distinct look and personality. Jerry Goldsmith's score is a comical blast and a half. The cast is fabulous, with all returning actors given their moment to shine and new cast members being very likable and entertaining. Glover is wonderful as the oddball Clamp. Christopher Lee makes for a memorable foil as a deranged genetic research scientist whose work allows the Gremlins to mutate into amusing new forms. And Robert Prosky gives a sense of class as a television host who gets caught up in the action. And the cinematography is also very sharp and works wonders, perfectly complimenting director Dante's unique and quirky visual sensibilities.""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" might not be for everyone. It's complex and hard-hitting commentary will likely fly over the heads of many viewers, and its deliberately ridiculous and farcical style may turn off the more hardcore fanbase of the original. But if you have an open mind, this is a journey well worth taking.I give it a very good 8 out of 10.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

John Glover is so good as true businessman Walter Clamp. Modernized special effects. But it lacks substance. The more they do, the less refined it looks. And the whole satire remains unnoticed. WB clearly wanted this one to be appealing to everyone, especially teenagers and young adults. And kids, with a watered down tension, compared to the first installment. Making the horror aspect too campy to give them nightmares. Gizmo being twice as adorable don't help either. They even placed lots of winks to their brand, and pop culture. Which was cool back in the day, but looks too desperate 30 years later. It used to be my favorite one as a kid, but now I see how pop corn movie, and forgettable it is.

71,baumer,Blame the gremlins for everything,9,9 September 1999,"To this day my friend and I still refer to the gremiln like he is real. When something goes wrong with my computer, it is the gremlin, when my keys are misplaced and then show up in a spot that you swear you checked before, it was the gremlin, when something, anything goes wrong, it has to be the gremlin.  I am actually convinced that Spike has taken on a life of his own (kinda the way Freddy did in Wes Craven's New Nightmare) and lives to make my life difficult.  Joe Dante's Gremlin's has had that much of an impact on my life.  Gremlins was a wonderful film and it was a little more creepy than it was funny.  But make no mistake about this one, it is one of the funnier movies that I've seen.  It abandons all that was scary and atmospheric in the first and just adds comedy a-plenty.  And I would seriously put this humour up against some of the funnier comdies of the 90's.This time the adventures of Magwai and Spike reach a skyskraper like building owned by a guy that has to be a distant cousin of Donald Trump. And if you think back to Gremlins, remember how much trouble the little guys could get into using simple household products (microwave, chimney etc ) well that is nothing compared to what they can do at an office filled with the latest technology.  There are also many many inside jokes about Hollywood and such that you have to watch it several times to pick up on all of them.  What is also great about the film is the two versions ( one for the theater and one for the VCR )  I remember when I saw this in the theater I really thought something was wrong with the projector when it first went all strange.  And I like the fact that the makers of this had the guts and the gaul to try something new like that.  It kind of reminds me of Something About Mary when at the end the entire cast is singing that song.  The movie never stops trying to entertain, and that is what I got from this film too.  It will do anything to make you laugh, even throw in a little Hulkamania when he was cool.Gremlins 2 is one of the funniest films that you will see.  And I'm just a little surprised that Joe Dante isn't still active so much in the business anymore.  He made some great films and I would gladly see anything that he puts his name on.  If you haven't seen this film for quite some time, then I highly suggest that you do see it soon.  I was browsing through Rick Baker's filmography on the IMDb and I came across Gremlins 2.  I rented it the same night and I was very glad I did.  Not only did it make me laugh, it brought me back to a time when films like this and The Goonies and even E.T. were made.  Movies aren't the same anymore and that is not neccessarily a criticism, it is just a comment pointing out that in the early 90's and the 80's movies were just different sometimes.  This is one of the funnier ones, and one of the more entertaining.  Do you remember a film by Amblin that wasn't?",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
72,gizmomogwai,Looney Tunes-like fun,8,11 November 2007,"Gremlins 2 could have been far worse. It could have been a cheap imitation of the original. Instead, the tone and style changed, so that a horror-comedy story became a tribute to the Looney Tunes' anarchic style of humour (and indeed, Looney Tunes characters Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck make actual appearances.) Even the music feels more cartoonish. The sharp break in style makes one hesitant to say that Gremlins and Gremlins 2 exist in the same continuity, but Gremlins 2 nevertheless picks up on the original's story, as Billy and the strange creature Gizmo are reunited in New York City. Billy intends to take Gizmo home, but carelessness causes Gizmo to multiply, creating more of the villainous gremlins who spread destruction throughout the building.Gremlins 2 gives more diversity among the gremlins to ensure this film will be sufficiently different from the original; the gremlins are their own characters and some of them mutate further. The comedy is off the wall, and one has to give the movie credit for doing what it set out to do. But in the same way, one can't quite call it a masterpiece because it does not try to be one.

74,one9eighty,When a Gremlin gets milked it makes a second movie,6,12 February 2020,"Billy Peltzer, Kate Beringer and Gizmo the Mogwai are back - but this time they are in New York. If you've seen the first Gremlins film you know what to expect, and you know the rules to follow. Unfortunately though they aren't followed (of course - or there wouldn't be a film), Gizmo gets wet, produces some Gremlins, and they go on a chaos fuelled rampage through a high-tech corporate skyscraper.This film often gets ignored as a rubbish sequel but in truth it's not that bad, it just tries a little too hard for me. It was made at a time when sequels where the in-thing, trying to expand a story sometimes for artistic purposes, sometimes to squeeze a few more dollars out of a story. Gremlins 2 falls somewhere between those two reasons - putting a decent concept in a new location but not actually bringing anything massively new - albeit a few laughs poking fun at itself. Expect more horror, and there definitely are a lot more laughs - but this is certainly nothing revolutionary which you won't see coming a mile off once you start watching the film. It doesn't take itself too seriously and often parodies itself in-between parodying some of Hollywood's finest films. Despite any negatives I may be writing, it isn't a hard film to watch and can easily be viewed without having to engage your brain too much. Unfortunately though, this sequel won't be a timeless film like the first outing of Gremlins. Decent without being brilliant - 6 out of 10.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
75,eminkl,Underthought and over-budgeted,4,17 April 2020,"I don't think anyone would call Gremlins a masterpiece. It worked, often surprisingly well, as a chaotic blend of unrelated genres and unrestrained mayhem, and that was enough. Its sequel, arriving a full six years after the original, is both a spiritual successor and a tonal departure, if that makes any sense. It retains the wicked laughs and playful, no-holds-barred character that made the first so much fun to watch, but completely disregards any shred of nuance. Granted, there's nothing all that subtle about microwaving a slimy green monster until it bursts, a particularly memorable scene from the first film, but by comparison that brand of development seems sophisticated. Gremlins 2 is like a doomed sketch comedy show, all distracted energy and crazy ideas without much focus. We've got mutated Gremlins with only the loosest of explanations (example: a veggie monster who's sampled tomato DNA). There's an ultra-shallow satire of Donald Trump, an out-of-touch media mogul who somehow does an about-face to play one of the story's heroes. Hulk Hogan directly addresses the camera. Grandpa Munster leaves the set of his late-night movie marathon to conduct a live interview with the monsters' leader (this one sipped from a bottle of brain juice, granting him refined tastes, a revolutionary's vision and a British accent). It's just way, way too much; dozens of patches to cover for a rather simple, stupid script. One caveat: it's hidden behind the crush of outrageous ideas and unhinged madness, but the film boasts a sharp sense of humor that regularly caught me by surprise. There's some genuinely witty, laugh-worthy material here, and that merits mention. Otherwise, consider this a case study for unnecessary sequels.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
76,The_Movie_Cat,Superior sequel,6,17 October 2000,"A Gremlins film for people that hated the original Gremlins? Well, maybe not quite. But this sequel does come close.I initially detested the 1984 film, though seeing it a second time did make me respect it a little more. It's skewed Disney-meets-horror sensibility and sub-Bedford Falls setting is quite literary, and rewarding. The humour is still unfulfilling, however, as it operates at face value. Put simply, an elderly lady crashing through her attic in an electric stairlift is a joke about an elderly lady crashing through her attic in an electric stairlift. In this sequel the jokes have wider, and more irreverent, reference. It even dares to insult the original. Whereas the first took it's time to establish the situation and only really got going in the last forty minutes, the second is a constant stream of gags that begin even before the opening titles. The first is the better film, but Gremlins 2: The New Batch is the better movie.The first real appearance of the Mogwai, Gizmo, sees him jiving to Fats Domino in a delightfully showoffish scene that only exists to brag about how much more advanced the special effects are. Film referencing is the game here, not always subtle, but diverting. Dracula gets several knocks, most obviously the Universal '31 version. Yet Christopher Lee, who played the count in 1958 for Hammer Films, also gets to double take at the bat homages. And is just me, or is the television ""Grandpa Fred"" a take-off of Fred Gwynne from The Munsters?64 minutes in and the picture crashes as the Gremlins actually take over the film. Unusually, two versions were shot, the video version and a cinema one with Hulk Hogan, which I didn't get to see. Though this is pleasing as John Wayne telling them to ""go on back to your own movie"" is more inspired. Their gunfight with Wayne as he tries to force them out of his film is a nice gimmick, though the makers lacked the guts to allow the Gremlins to shoot him. Still, a nice touch all the same.Leonard Maltin appears as himself, slating the original movie, while the somewhat silly ""rules"" of the first are mocked by those that hear them. Another top 84-bashing moment is Phoebes Cates beginning another anecdote about how she was made miserable on a public holiday, to match the original's ""dad dead on Christmas"" story. ""Honey,"" says Zach Galligan, ""I really don't think we've got time for this now, y'know?"" The rest of the cast look on in disapproval.The humour is still perhaps a little too unsophisticated to really engage as satire, but as an option over the first it does extremely well. The idea of a sequel trashing its source is fairly unique, and must be praised. The weirdest thing about the film, though, is the hilarious mock footage clip of the film ""The Attack of the Octopus People"" (""And boy, is it scary!"") It turns out that this ridiculous fake clip is actually a genuine film  1971's Octaman.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

The sequel was more funnier, entertaining and adventurous than the first. The story is good and different: this time, the stakes are high in this sequel. I say this because, now, they are in New York, and the Gremlins could wreak havoc in an entire city. I first remember seeing this appearing on television, and I founded it to be very enjoyable. Brings back memories whenever I see it again. I would say its underrated, and probably goes unnoticed. I think this is one of these rare movies where many people don't know that a sequel exists, and/or there is a movie that comes before this one. That's what I sometimes think regarding the Gremlins.

Clamp is one of America's biggest cable-network and businessmen who invests in technology and has a highly advanced building that is a historical landmark in New York now. In downtown Chinatown, Gizmo (Voiced by Howie Mandall) the adorable Mogwaii has just lost his master (Keye Luke) and is captured by a Clamp research scientist who wants to study him. Later on in the building, Billy rescues him from a nasty scientist (Christopher Lee) as he plans on taking him home with him. Giz gets wet yet again as he spawns three Mogwais that soon will become nasty gremlins that take over the building as their new home. The gremlins have multiplied and thanks to genetic material they mutate into a variety of different gremlins such as a Spider gremlin, an intelligent talking gremlin (Voiced by Tony Randall), a she-gremlin, a vegetable gremlin and more that are trying to create havoc once again.Brilliant and highly underrated sequel to the 1984 horror fantasy comedy masterpiece!

83,jhaggardjr,Respectable sequel,7,9 April 2000,"""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" is the 1990 sequel to the 1984 box office hit ""Gremlins"" which is one of my all-time favorite movies. The sequel is not as good as the original, but its not bad either. Here the filmakers did something different. They tried to make this one more of a comedy than the original. The first film was funny but also scary. ""Gremlins 2"" plays more like a Mel Brooks-type movie with some of the jokes that are in it. But its hardly scary. Plus, it got a little tiresome to watch the gremlins do some of the exact same things that they did the first time around like drinking, smoking, etc. Nevertheless, this is for the most part an entertaining movie that I'd wish had done better at the box office. I think if they had made this three years after the original instead of six years, it would have done better. In between the two ""Gremlins"" flicks there were all those ripoffs (""Critters"", ""Ghoulies"" and their sequels) and by 1990 moviegoers became tired of it all. But the two ""Gremlins"" movies are much better than the ""Critters"" and ""Ghoulies"" movies. A good job by director Joe Dante.*** (out of four)",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
84,baileycrawly,Meh,3,1 July 2020,"Gizmo and the mutated Furby army are back again to raise hell in a film that requires its audience to ignore any semblance of logic to follow and, ultimately, has no reason to exist. It doesn't offer any kind of revolutionary character insights, nor does it particularly go out of its way to expand upon any of the major details of the first one. It appears to have been created and released purely in the name of profit, a way of cashing in on a profitable concept by bringing in the original cast (nostalgia sells, even in the 80s, and even after only a short period of time has passed) and the Gizmo character (who is every bit as adorable as ever) because they know it'll make a few dollars.
And that, perhaps, is the highest compliment this film can be given in this review.
The first 80 seconds of this film are precisely what Warner Bros. loves doing best. They own one of the biggest cast of cartoon characters in animated history (second only to Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse and company) and they love nothing more than reminding you just how vast their hold on American culture is. The problem is that this isn't a Looney Tunes film, and it's not a movie that would appeal to young kids. And yet, this film begins with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck in an absolute waste of time to sit through. It only adds to the runtime.
It's also important to note the absolutely redundant lack of reality that this film follows. Our hero from the original just so happens to have moved to the general vicinity of Gizmo, and someone who works in the same building as him just so happens to capture Gizmo and take him to another floor of the building. And Our Hero just so happens to find out by someone humming Gizmo's little song on his floor. It's about the laziest excuse of sequel writing that may ever have been done; it's the kind of thing a lazy director would throw together to help pay off his debts in a rush.
Combining the ridiculous Looney Tunes opening and the absolutely senseless convenience of the thing, this film isn't off to a good start.
The rest of the film is what it is; it's a copy and paste of the original film in a different setting and with a few additional details thrown in to keep the fans happy. It tries to accomplish more than its special effects team was really capable of realistically handling, creating a film that is vastly inferior in its special effects. The most important character, however, is still perfect. Gizmo is still the most adorable little creature on the planet, even if his run is just another in the horrible special effects.
This movie isn't funny, and it's not even really all that entertaining. It's the kind of thing you'd watch once to be able to say you've seen it, and then block out of your mind. The issue is that your movie isn't more entertaining than its predecessor just because you have more gremlins. You need to have a story that the viewer can care about, and that story needs to both improve upon the original while also differentiating itself from its predecessor simultaneously. This film does neither.
It's a campy way to spend 100 minutes of your life, but unless you were particularly fond of the original, this film isn't really worth it. It's a film that really wants to accomplish something, to entertain the audience and leave them wanting more, but it tries too hard and, ultimately, offers too little.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

86,DavidSim240183,Off the wall and completely out there,8,8 August 2007,"As sequels go, Gremlins 2: The New Batch is quite inventive and darkly original. Qualities you don't usually find in the standard sequel. But it also has traits you find in nearly every sequel. Its the same sort of story recycled over again.Gremlins 2 is not a straight rehash of its predecessor, the 1984 classic. It has a few innovations and changes the setting from a sleepy all-American town to a New York high rise. But it never quite surmounts the fact that it follows very similar paths to Gremlins.Joe Dante is back in the directors chair, and with this film, his wacky imagination has really been let off its leash. Although Steven Spielberg produced Gremlins 1&2, I get the impression his influence here is a little less pronounced. He probably restrained Dante last time so things didn't get too dark. But here, Dante's been given a larger budget, a whole new set of special effects to play with, and a gleefully irreverent screenplay to sink his teeth into. The result is a fast, frantic and even more anarchic Gremlins picture.We all know how the Gremlins are created. Through the cute, cuddly Mogwai Gizmo. If he gets wet, he breeds them. And if they eat after midnight, they turn from cute and furry to green and scary. And that's what happens here.This time, the action has been transplanted from sugary Kingston Falls to the shiny Clamp Tower, a gigantic skyscraper with God knows how many floors. This is a building that represents everything wrong with the world. Everything here is automated, from lifts and climate control right down to the self-cleaning ashtrays on many an executive's desk. A place ripe for demolishing.Dante clearly gets a great deal of fun and enjoyment from gradually tearing this faceless figurehead of American capitalism down one cliché at a time. And while the film is fun, it is ultimately hollow.Gremlins was a better film because for me, there was something genuinely magical about it. The special effects were really quite superb for 1984 and they still hold up remarkably well today. There came a time when you forgot you were watching what was really a bunch of puppets running riot. They seemed like living beings to me.But Gremlins 2, while maybe more technically proficient, is just a bit too much. Dante can certainly be commended for trying out new things. But there comes a time when the invention keeps building and building until it loses all sense of a reality check.I'll give you an example. Dante is known for breaking down the fourth wall in his films. This technique was incorporated with more subtlety in Pt 1, like a Gremlin using a hand-puppet (a puppet using a puppet), or tearing through a cinema screen, but Gremlins 2 takes the approach just a step too far. Here we have Gremlins stopping the film at the halfway point, and resorting to Hulk Hogan to straighten things out. It's a technique that's trying to be too clever for its own good.Dante is also known for breezy, fast-paced direction. Sometimes at the expense of plot. And in Gremlins 2 its particularly noticeable. It all begins with a thin semblance of plot, but once the Gremlins take over, the film splinters off into a number of setpieces with no real focus or structure. Some are quite hilarious, like their rendition of New York, New York. And I liked the scenes with the Brain Gremlin, a Gremlin who drinks a gene-enhanced formula in the building's genetics lab and turns into a chatty, pint-sized motivational speaker.But other scenes with a Spider Gremlin, a Bat Gremlin and a Vegetable Gremlin seem to be there just for arguments sake. There's certainly a fair degree of imagination on display, but its a cocktail that seems just a bit too rich at times.Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are back on hand. But they only really walk around the set trying to figure out how they plug into all this. There's quite a wonderful supporting cast though. John Glover turns in an hilarious performance as Daniel Clamp, the Donald Trump/Ted Turner media mogul who watches aghast as his corporate empire goes down in flames. His performance is an amusing flip-side to his more sinister, ruthless character Lionel Luthor in Smallville.Robert Prosky does a nicely warm performance as Grandpa Fred, a failed late night creature-feature host. He's dressed up as Dracula for the whole running time, but even buried under makeup, his warmth shines through. And Christopher Lee is perfectly sinister as Dr Catheter, the mad scientist who mixes up genetic cocktails the Gremlins keep drinking.I also liked Haviland Morris' fast-talking chain-smoking department head. Even though she's given criminally little to do. And Dante regular Dick Miller is back to get revenge on the Gremlins who shattered his life.There are too many individual Gremlin sequences to mention in one review. Its best just to let the film carry you on the wacky roller-coaster ride it wants to go. Which means tons of in-jokes, special effects and a plot the film occasionally remembers to get back to. It makes for broad satire, and there are gags aplenty. But Gremlins 2 is exhausting at times. Its a fun ride to be sure, but even on rollercoasters, we eventually want them to stop some time.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
87,TheMarwood,"Occasionally inspired, but too silly",7,23 May 2014,"The first act of Gremlins 2 is bad. How Gizmo is found by Billy, how Gizmo gets wet and spawns all of the gremlins, Billy's annoying boss who aggressively wants Billy -- this makes for some terrible entertainment. As little effort was put into the set-up, the rest of the film is almost all payoff. The remaining 2 acts have basically no plot, just random scenes of Gremlins causing mayhem and they could have been edited in almost any order, but this is where Dante shines. It's basically violent Looney Tunes with Gremlins. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates barely register as a presence, but it's the Gremlins show this time around. It's a silly film and the puppet work and animatronics are great.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
88,Donatien3,More Meta Mayhem,10,31 July 2021,"A pop-culture sensation in the 1990s, ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" raises the stakes from the equally excellent first movie: more Gremlins, more Gizmo cuteness, more meta humour, and more comedy-horror insanity.Set exclusively in the Clamp Center - a state-of-the-art highrise building in Manhattan - it doesn't take long before Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates) discover the adorable Gizmo and the new batch of Gremlins appear after a janitor accidentally gets Gizmo wet.While some of early 90s special effects look a bit ropey, there's all sorts of new Gremlins to enjoy: including a Gremlin made of electricity; a flying Bat-Gremlin; a female Gremlin; a Brain Gremlin, complete with a sophisticated British accent (voiced by Tony Randall); and - probably the most scary of all in a relatively family-friendly movie - a grotesque Spider-Gremlin. Horror icon Christopher Lee also has a decent role as a scientist whose experiments inadvertently help the Gremlins evolve.For all the comedy-horror goodness, it's the meta humour that stands out: there's homages to ""Batman"" (1989), ""Rambo"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Marathon Man"", and ""The Phantom of the Opera"". There also a couple of brilliant references to the ""Gremlins"" franchise: firstly, famous film reviewer Leonard Maltin is attacked while giving the original ""Gremlins"" a scathing review; secondly, a screening of ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" is interrupted by the monsters themselves, with the iconic Hulk Hogan stepping in to reprimand the Gremlins and resume the movie, which is meta upon meta!Even 30 years later, ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" is still a lot of silly fun.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

It's not long after their reunion with Gizmo (he's so cute it's sickening) that the little guy is accidentally hit with water and the villainous title characters return to wreak havoc. This time their target is a high-tech corporate skyscraper run by a Trump-like suit.""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" tries hard enough, and it's certainly original and creative. But it just never really clicks. The film plays like a bad episode of ""The Muppet Show"" as the cartoonish gremlins sing musical numbers, destroy property and morph into giant bats and spiders. It repeatedly attempts to poke fun at itself, but those efforts, too, fall flat on their face. Maybe the gremlins just aren't cut out for comedy. Chalk this one up as one of the weakest efforts from highly-talented director Joe Dante.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
90,TheRedDeath30,"A Real Lover of Original, but Willing to Admit Sequel Sucks",4,11 August 2015,"First, my little back of obligatory backstory. I was 9 years old when the original GREMLINS was released. Probably smack dab in the middle of the perfect target audience for a fun little horror film full of gleeful gore and maniacal monsters. Due to many factors, a sequel to the mega-hit was not produced for some time afterwards. By the time this was released, I was then 15 and looking for something a little more from my entertainment. The sequel was, then, quickly relegated to a little corner of my memory.Years have elapsed. I have submersed myself in horror films and still, to this day, have an undying love of the original. I can see, now, all of the fun little horror tidbits that Dante hid in his movie for the more adult viewers, while spicing just enough family fun to keep the whole family interested.This movie, though, is lacking any of the charm and craft that made the original so good. What Dante and all involved seem to have forgotten is that the gremlins and mogwai became stars, but what made the original so successful was good writing, a good script and a good plot.This sequel seems hellbent on packing as many different gremlin creations and bad jokes as possible in its' runtime. There is almost no story developed here, at all, and the story that is doesn't make sense half of the time. The plot moves along just enough to propel the viewer from one gag to another, most of which are not funny by child or adult standards, that become a tireless, repetitive bore by the end. Naturally, most of these gags also serve to introduce us to a bevy of new characters, with their own personalities. Yes, it smells a little too much of marketing and the need to create new mogwai/gremlins as if they figured they missed out on something with only having Gizmo and Stripe as recognizable creations in the original. Most of these new creations are even more annoying than the gags.Even the human characters have become cardboard cutouts this time around. Billy and his girlfriend are barely there, just fodder for another gag, or when the plot is needed to move along to the next step. The corporate heads are interesting ideas that become convoluted and, mostly, generic. Even the great Christopher Lee is wasted here in a role that anyone could have filled, as a minor scientist who serves only to introduce the experiments that will, in turn, produce the gallery of gremlin hybrids.Many point out the fun easter eggs in this movie and how much this shows Dante's love of 50s sci fi. Yes, it is fun for a drive-in horror junkie like myself to find those hidden gems and appreciate all the little nods to films of past years that Dante worked in, but that doesn't even come close to saving this movie from being a mess.About halfway through this, my wife and I looked at each other and quickly realized exactly why we had both pushed this to the depths of our subconscious. If you removed the GREMLINS franchise name from this movie, you'd have nothing but a second-rate imitation, which is all this really is in the end.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
91,TheCorniestLemur,It's just not funny,3,19 December 2020,"Bloody hell, this was painful. Supposedly, this is considered a highly satirical sequel, which...okay? I could probably count the number of jokes that struck me as even vaguely referential to anything on one hand, and the number of them that made me slightly chuckle on a pirate's hook. That being Gizmo turning into Rambo, if you were curious.You'll probably know I'm not really a huge fan of the first Gremlins either, but it was at least an entertaining way to kill 106 minutes, whereas this was just either cringey (what the actual hell, Hulk Hogan), or barely any different to the first one. It's just another series of wacky incidents caused by little green monsters that look worse than they did in the first film, that barely does anything to evolve the concept that, let's be honest, wasn't really anything mind-blowingly original to begin with.Everything about the directing and acting is once again fine, but the characters are still the blankest of slates, and the writing throughout is just annoying. What happened to the whole ""I think he's cheating"" subplot, why are there extended Looney Tunes segments in the beginning and end, why was I hearing about a small handful of referential jokes apparently constituting ""satire"", and why is this film just so annoying?I don't think I'll ever get answers to any of these questions, but if I'm probably never going to really think about the first film ever again, this one'll be occupying my thoughts about as much as the political situation in Ghana on a daily basis, so nor do I really care.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
92,jerekra,"""Gizmo""",9,6 January 2011,"Gremlins 2 is an outstanding sequel to Gremlins. It takes a more comedic touch to the film and the end result is a highly funny and entertaining film.Billy and his girlfriend both work at a highly advanced building. Gizmo meanwhile has his owner die and is captured by a scientist who works at the same building that Billy works at. They get reunited and soon after Gizmo gets wet and this leads to a new batch of evil Mogwai getting created. Soon they eat after midnight and go on a destructive spree through the building.The story of this film works as a sequel. It is not just the same as the first one. This one gets to the action much quicker and this enables more fun to be had with more Gremlin time.The Gremlins have far more personality in this one. You get a lot of scenes with them doing hilarious stuff. You also get a wider variety of them with the potions in the science lab transforming them to different forms; electric, spider, and many others.Gizmo is great again, looking far cuter and having far more scenes that involve him. Howie Mandel once again is great as his voice. The main villain, Mohawk, is the most awesome Gremlin ever and is voiced by Frank Welker. Mohawk is outstanding and makes for some awesome cinematic excellence.The human characters are what they are, nothing special. I like how this film tends to be more about the Gremlins.A fun time, a great sequel. I find that this one is the better film and is a better one that applies to a wider range of viewers.

93,ryan-10075,"""Gremlins? In this theatre? Now?""",8,2 June 2020,"I saw this sequel back in the day at the theatre with some friends including Iain who was I think as big of a fan of the original as I was. Oh yeah and I loved it! Joe Dante returns as the director who was I thought the perfect director to bring GREMLINS to the screen. He shows to me he really was one of the best at doing satires. With this and PIRANHA he shows he has a great sense of humour and the ability to make fun of something without ripping down what was created before it. Loaded with millions of in-jokes. Yet, I do know some people who enjoyed the original who hate the sequel, so perhaps beware.The story of the film has a Donald Trump-styled character Daniel Clamp (John Glover) is wanting to buy out Mr. Wing (Keye Luke) so he can put up Clump Chinatown Centre. Mr. Wing passes away and the store is then being demolished, because Clamp did somehow get a hold of it after Wing's death. That leaves Gizmo without a home. Splice O 'Life gets their hands on him so they can conduct tests on him. We soon see that Billy (Zach Galligan) and Kate (Phoebe Cates) work in the same building that Splice O' Life is in as they work for Daniel Clamp. Billy finds Gizmo and guess what? Those three simple rules are being followed again.The effects in this film are A+ other than a scene where a winged-Gremlin attacking Murray Futterman (Dick Miller) in the New York streets. That certain scene didn't look good back in 1990. But, the design of Gizmo and the gremlins are awesome and Rick Baker did fabulous work here. I seem to remember a certain gremlin goes through a paper shredder. There was a lot of screaming in the theatre that night. Personally, I was smiling and loving it.Jerry Goldsmith returns to score the film and while it is quite similar to the original there are some changes and the film does come across with its own music. Also starring Robert Prosky as Grandpa Fred who dresses as Dracula for his own horror movie show at the Clamp Network, Robert Picardo as Forster, the great Christopher Lee, who apologized to Dante for being in HOWLING 2 plays Dr. Catheter at Splice O' Life, Jackie Joseph returns as Sheila Futterman, Howie Mandel returns to voice plays Gizmo and Tony Randall voices the Brain Gremlin. There are some very funny cameos featuring John Astin, Henry Gibson, Leonard Maltin and Hulk Hogan. When watching the film just remember to laugh and don't take it seriously.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
94,Toronto85,Gremlins 2: The New Batch,8,24 April 2011,"Gremlins 2 continues the story of Gizmo, the cute little toy like creature from the original. Of course along with Gizmo comes the rules that must be followed in order to keep the evil Gremlins from coming out and destroying everything in sight. The movie begins with the death of the old man who we saw in the first Gremlins that was taking care of Gizmo. Little Gizmo ends up being captured by a scientist who works at the Clamp Cable Network building in downtown New York City. Gremlins' two main characters Billy and Kate (Gallagan and Cates) return and are working in same building (Clamp office tower). It is there that the Gremlins break loose and take over the skyscraper. One of the rules to Gizmo is never get him wet. Of course, a plumber sprays water from a fountain and it hits Gizmo unleashing the devilish monsters.The story is basically that. But where the movie succeeds in is the actual portrayal of the monsters themselves. They were mischievous and comical in the first one, but they go all out for laughs in Gremlins 2. The Gremlins sing a rendition of ""Start Spreading the News"", one of them wears make up and tries to be seductive, a few of them take over a cooking show being filmed in progress. It's all pretty funny stuff. The major ""problem"" I had with the first Gremlins was that it took itself WAY too serious. It's a movie about tiny monsters who terrorize a town, it isn't supposed to be realistic. This one recognizes that and milks every comedic moment for all it's worth.It's also good to see the continuation of Billy and Kate. They are now an actual couple, Zach Galligan and Pheobe Cates worked well together and were just as good in this one as they were in the first film. I also like the location of the office tower in New York, the interior adds much to the movie. Gremlins 2 is a good sequel to the enjoyable first film. Check it out.8/10",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
95,Old Joe,Here they grow again.,10,26 March 2001,"I was in for more of a surprise than I thought when I saw Gremlins 2 - The New Batch. But of course I forgot all the rules. Don't get them wet, keep them away from bright light and never ever feed them after midnight. So they are back bigger and badder than ever before. My feeling with this film is that you don't take it too seriously and just have some fun, because that is all Gremlins 2 is trying to do, tickle your funny bone.Yesterday it was rural Kingston Falls. Today it's the Big Apple - and lots of wild anarchic comedy - because a new batch of mischievous green meanies is on the loose. Billy and Kate have moved to New York and are reunited with Gizmo, the cute little Magwai. They are also forced to save the day, once again. We told you the rules. You didn't listen. Now you'll have to face up to the consequences. And have a blast doing it. The most impressive part of Gremlins 2 are the Gremlins themselves. They are simply breathtaking. My favourite character would have to be the 'Brain' Gremlin. Some of the quotes he comes out with are hilarious. In his many different situations he is just a comic. I enjoyed it when he recovers from drinking the brain serum, in the brokerage room, the TV interview and when he gets the whole Gremlin gang singing the chorus 'New York, New York'. Out of all the movies I have seen, I would have to say that the 'Brain' Gremlin is my favourite character of all-time. The voiceovers in this Gremlins were outstanding. The most dominant voice in the whole film belongs to Tony Randall, whose talents shine out as the voice of the 'Brain' Gremlin. He did those voiceovers to perfection. He stared in the 70's TV series 'The Odd Couple'. If he wasn't involved in this movie, I believe it would have been a real let down. Other Gremlins that were of great significance for this film include the Salad Gremlin, Electricity Gremlin, Funny Gremlin, Dumb Gremlin and just plain stupid Gremlin. But for truly great special effects, the greatest Gremlin is the Spider Gremlin. When he starts to chase after Kate and Marla in the hallway, it is remarkable to see him walking along and the underneath shots of him. In fact he almost looks real. This leads me to give praise to the special effects team and its leader, Rick Baker. They would have had a huge job and they did it perfectly in this film.  I must admit that the directing and producing of Gremlins 2 would have taken a lot of time and patience. Steven Spielberg and his production team did a hell of a job, as did director Joe Dante. There were some extraordinary scenes and they would have taken a serious amount of directing to get just right. Some of the scenes which standout for me include nearly all the Gremlin shots (eg. scene in the control tower, the abuse with Gizmo and of course the 'Brain' Gremlin who was just superb), with all of them causing havoc in their own wacky kind of way, the scenes in the Hi-Tech Clamp building, the Gizmo scenes are much better, considering that he is given a lot more latitude in this movie.  Voicing Gizmo for the second time is Howie Mandal and he is pretty good as well. Yet one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie would have to be in the TV Kitchen with the somewhat drunk, Microwave Marge.The human cast of this film takes second fiddle to these ugly little monsters. Back in reprising roles are Zach Gilligan and Phoebe Cates. They were great in the first movie and nothing has changed second time around. Also appearing again are Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph as the Futterman's. They were unlucky in the first film and are essential, in my opinion, in the second. I recently saw Dick Miller in the small role he had in the 1984 classic, Terminator. The new cast members in this movie include John Glover, Robert Proskey and Harviland Morris. Glover was exceptional as Daniel Clamp. His silly antics as the boss of a Hi-Tech. office building are very funny. Likewise, Proskey is hilarious as the roving reporter through all the mischief and mayhem (especially in the TV interview with the 'Brain' Gremlin just brilliant). Morris plays Marla, Billy's boss, someone who is very tense, hardworking and a terrible flirt. The story isn't that important in this movie. Ultimately it is about these little green monsters that are inhabiting a Hi-Tech office building in New York City, and having fun doing so. But the most interesting part of this script is the way that this film sends up certain well-known movies and icons. It first of all it pokes fun at the first film (with movie reviewer Leonard Maltin) and then takes off movies such as Batman and Rambo, plus there is a Gremlin version of the famous musical, Phantom of the Opera. In one scene there is a Gremlin playing with Lego, a famous line of children's toy and one who is promoting Warner Brothers themselves. This aspect of the film was truly crazy, but very funny too. Overall Gremlins 2 is a different kind of sequel. By the time it has bagged its predecessor and other known movies, musicals and famous icons, this movie is about to explode. Many sequels are criticised for not being that great. My understanding of a sequel is that it is in some way better than it's original, and I feel that Gremlins 2 fills the criteria. I wouldn't be able understand it, if people don't like the classic sequel, coz it is very original. Gremlins 2, The New Batch - 'Is that civilised? No clearly not, fun but in no sense civilised!'

96,chvylvr80,Not as good as the first one,5,16 September 2003,"Gremlins 2 is a lot more light hearted than the first one. It takes itself a little less seriously but lacks some of the charm of the first one. The Gremlins mutations are fun to watch, especially the Brain Gremlin, but overall this movie falls a little flat. The cast does a decent job but there isn't a lot to do here. Some of the jokes fall flat and this film has none of the edge of the original. Looking back, I think perhaps it shouldn't have been made. Bottom Line: It's not great but if you liked Gremlins you should at least watch it once.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

But he won't sell. When he dies Gizmo is left to a horrible world of experiments and fear. Not more than 15 minutes in you'll see Gizmo get wet and we see those ugly evil..........things come back.Along with family interference and loads of laughs we have a few tears shed. Gizmo is undoubtedly cute and whenever you see him on TV you have to go awe. Recommended for everyone even babies. Even your dog will find this entertaining.

It has everything that made Gremlins such a nice movie, plus an amount of satire and craziness that has been rarely paralleled before or since. It's as much fun and as irreverent as ""Life of Brian"". There isn't a single take or artistic choice I didn't like here, everything fits, the timing is impeccable, no joke falls flat and even the musical number is hilarious. The actors had a great time it seems, it's the rare film where you can ham it up to such delirious heights.Plus, the film is stuffed with references to classics (I especially liked how they carried one of the pods from Bodysnatchers through the background in the biolab)My favourite character here, btw, is Microwave Marge.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

Pretty funny sometimes, had some unexpected commentary in the form of jokes
Decent action with the different creatures, the lab was a wise gimmick to implement
The first magwi and gremlins had a lot of character
Good callbacks to the first one, I liked every returning characterCons:
Building made no sense at all
The goofy gremlin designs fall flat
Some bad effects here and there
Story is fairly coincidental, no real stake in what happened next (aside from a small handful of real human deaths)Best part: Hulk Hogan threatening gremlins in the balcony area

Wired, Spider, Batty, Brain, Hottie, Stogie, Dummy, Electric, Fruity just to name a few. I like how they gave them all sorts of persona's instead of generic ones.The Brain gremlin had an interesting roll and was actually likable, Wired was hilarious especially when he was throwing the food at everyone. Spider, Stogie and Dummy were basically the 3 stooges bumbling around. It was a grand effort to make the public laugh and it worked.I like how they got Gette Watanabe from Gung Ho and Sixteen Candles to play the cameraman for Uncle Fred...and his friends.GREAT movie with some cool cameos (depending on the VHS or DVD version...VHS has John Wayne, DVD has Hulk Hogan) and unforgettable scenes (Brain singing New York, New York with Wired, Stogie etc playing the instruments)8 out of 10",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

We were all booing and wondering what the hell happened till my friend told me that it was part of the movie.  It sure had us fooled.  That is what is so good about this movie.  It fools you and keeps you laughing.  I especially loved the Cooking With Marge part where she is drunk while she is on a cooking show and all of a sudden the gremlins attack, a fire starts and the sprinklers come on making them multiply.  They plot to escape the building once the sun goes down so the humans have an idea of putting a banner down making them think that it's night time when it's not killing them but instead it starts to storm.  So Billy tells Mr. Fudderman to spray the gremlins with water.  Reluctly he sprays them with water and Billy picks up the phone and gets the electric gremlin out of the phone system and electuctes the gremlins while they sing ""New York"".

103,crowrobot,Lovably outlandish and hilarious...,10,9 August 2005,"There's no other way to start this review: If you liked ""Gremlins"", odds are you'll like ""The New Batch"". The sequel to the horror/comedy hit back in 1984 does something very few sequels accomplish: It respects and stands along the original, but it's even more outrageous and hilarious. Folks, I'm not kidding; this is probably one of the strangest non-drug-induced-pretentious-art-films you will ever see. In spite of that, 'Gremlins 2' is gloriously entertaining and director Joe Dante is at the top of his game.It's been a while since Kingston Falls. Billy (Zach Galligan) and Kate (Phoebe Cates) have moved to New York to work for mogul DanieL Clamp (John Glover). Meanwhile, Gizmo is still at his little Chinatown shop, in mourning for his owner Mr. Wing (Keye Luke). When the shop is torn down, Gizmo escapes but is captured by a scientist from the genetics lab in Clamp's building. The inevitable happens, and now the Gremlins are bigger and badder thanks to the genetics lab. One gremlin's skin turns into vegetables, one becomes a bat, there's an electric gremlin, and there's even Brain Gremlin (voice of Tony Randall), a superintelligent little devil and the ringleader of the new batch. Can the Gremlins be prevented from overrunning New York? If you don't know the answer to that question, you haven't seen enough movies.The main attraction of the film is Gizmo and the Gremlins themselves. Gizmo in particular toughens up and takes a page from Rambo's book (this is funnier than it sounds). The Gremlins are not so much scary this time around; almost every scene with them has some measure of wit. The whole movie feels like a live-action Looney Tunes cartoon, and I cannot express how painfully hilarious 'Gremlins 2' is.The puppetry by Rick Baker is fantastic, the laughs are loud and frequent, and Joe Dante needs an AFI tribute pretty soon. What more could you want?",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
104,watto124,MUCH better than the first! An inspired comic romp!,9,18 November 2001,"Gremlins 2 is more of a satire than the first one. It pokes fun of corporate behavior, technology, and architecture in way that astounds. I can't understand why people thing this is the worst of the 2 Gremlins films. I just can't imagine why. The first one was more of a serious fantasy while this one is more of a smart, goofy, satiric comedy that, in my opinion far surpasses the original. The two young heroes are back (with much improved acting skills), along with a scene stealing comic genius John glover (who plays the billionaire), and Christopher Lee as a nutty scientist. The movie contains many movie spoofs and one-liners that you'll be thinking about for awhile. The effects are better thanks to the mastery of multi  award-winner Rick Baker. And Charlie Haas' script is fantastically entertaiing. I loved this movie! I don't see why anyone else wouldn't! It boggles the mind!    9/10",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

All through this movie I kept thinking to myself that this is the kind of film Avery would have made had he been a live-action director.  All rules are suspended in this one. Nothing is spared, not even the film (or video tape) that the movie is printed on!  Gags and movie inside jokes abound in this one.  The only reason I gave this a 9 instead of 10 is because the lead character should not be the blandest thing about a movie, but Zach Galligan's Billy is here. Otherwise, this is one extremely wild and funny film.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
107,soymilk,"A splendid, entertaining puppet show",8,28 March 2005,"How well you receive this sequel will most likely depend on just which aspect of Gizmo's initial misadventure you found more appealing  the eerie, nasty creepiness or the quirky, subversive sense of humour. It was a flick that semi-took itself seriously and semi-didn't. If you loved it for its value as a mild horror movie, then you'll probably be disappointed with its follow-up, seeing as how it pretty much ditches those scares along the wayside and lets the comedic essence run wild and free to its heart's content. But if that's what made the original 'Gremlins' work for you, then you're in for a sequel more than twice as enjoyable as its predecessor. Luckily for me, I happen to belong to the latter group.Six years on from the gremlin rampage that laid waste to the residents of Kingston Falls, and we're back with Billy Peltzer and those fluffy, bat-eared fuzzballs that turn into vindictive little demons if they eat something after midnight. This time round, the bulk of the action takes place in a high-rise New York skyscraper, run by media mogul Daniel Clamp (a thinly-veiled pastiche on Donald Trump)  an impersonal and overly-automated working environment which it's genuinely fun to see the gremlins have their wicked way with. The screenplay has a sharper, more satirical edge than its forerunner, and makes a good start by openly mocking some of the more ridiculous values that the original 'Gremlins' stood for  Billy's co-workers respond with all the appropriate queries that movie left us puzzling over when he tries outlining the three 'Rules' which must be obeyed to prevent a gremlin outbreak (seriously, what would happen if you crossed into a different time zone?). And Billy's reply is satisfying enough  ""Look, I didn't make the rules, okay?"" Plot-wise there isn't really a great deal happening here  the gremlins run amok amongst the building's various facilities, while the humans have to get out safely and prevent them from taking their destruction to further afield. I wouldn't even say their various antics are substantial enough to be considered 'sketches'  what this film mainly consists of is a barrage of individual moments, in-jokes and sight gags which last barely a split-second each (blink and you'll miss about a dozen) but which nonetheless keep on coming so thick, fast and consistently that there's always something on screen to keep us entertained. It also makes the movie as a whole extremely rewatchable, as you can almost guarantee that you'll spot several completely new things you missed on previous viewings.Zach Galligan still makes for a rather bland and indistinctive hero, Billy's only real point of strength over most of the other characters being that he's dealt with these creatures before and knows how to handle them. Phoebe Cates, Jackie Joseph and Dick Miller have all returned on form, but it's the fresh set of supporting characters, in the Clamp Corporation's employees, who really put their all into snatching the spotlight from the gremlins. Haviland Morris and Robert Picardo both play their parts with the appropriate levels of energy and exaggeration, John Glover makes Daniel Clamp into a surprisingly likable character by portraying him with a vivid child-like innocence, while Christopher Lee comes very close to stealing every scene that he's in, only just losing out to one freakishly articulate gremlin who wears specs and is voiced by Tony Randall.The puppetry used to render our centrepiece creatures, in both their incarnations, is also a marked improvement over the previous instalment  all the same, their movements may be less jerky and their designs more polished, but the real delight still comes in the knowledge we have that they're puppets. And, instead of trying to make them into convincing, terrifying beings as the original attempted in some of its scenes, it's comfortable to depict them as what they essentially are  depraved, reptilian cousins to the Muppets. They're never scary, and won't have anyone at home screaming as they do the human characters, but they manage to achieve a strong sense of subversive charm in its place that, quite frankly, suits this breed of film much better. Movie monsters were never the same when puppetry became old school and CGI took its place  oh sure, when done right they can look amazingly realistic that way, but they're never as likable and fun. In that sense 'Gremlins 2: the New Batch' was one of the last of its kind, but a perfect swansong for the medium  incredibly silly, but fast-paced, sharply-scripted and gloriously entertaining enough to more than compensate. It comes recommended, especially for anyone who wishes that the rest of the original 'Gremlins' movie could've been more like that wonderful tavern sequence.Grade: A-",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
108,DrPhibes1964,Better than the First,9,24 November 2020,"Whereas the original Gremlins was a straight up horror film, Gremlins 2: The New Batch is a demented Warner Brothers cartoon that throws jokes out at you fast and furious. Everything and everyone is secondary to the gremlins hijinks as they take over the Clamp building. It becomes not much of a linear story but series of set pieces where the gremlins inflict as much mayhem upon those trapped within the building as possible. The highlight is anytime Brain (voiced by Tony Randall) is on screen and turns the character into a erudite lunatic. The funniest moment is when he shoots a fellow gremlin while being interviewed by a horror show host inspired by Grandpa Munster and then says: Now was that civilised? Fun, yes, but hardly civilised. This a film that is just packed with so many in jokes that it requires multiple viewings to spot them. Sometimes they are character names or little signs that flash by. Director Joe Dante had no intention of making a film with a solid story, but has a firm enough plot to hang all these gags on without it ever becoming mindless or pointless. The characters are strong enough not to get totally buried beneath the gramlin onslaught. Zach Galligan_Phoebe Cates, Robert Picardo, Dick Miller, and John Glover as the Ted Turner/Donald Trump hybrid Daniel Clamp. I got to see it on its initial release and loved the moment when it looked as it the film was getting burned. Being the era when celluloid still existed it was plausible. After a few seconds of the blank white screen (it should have lasted a little longer just to freak people out) the gremlins appear and make shadow puppets. Then Hulk Hogan is summoned by theatre owner Paul Bartel to rid the projection booth of the pesky gremlins. It was a funny digression from the story. But for the DVD release it is John Wayne who dispatches the critters. The final production number is something out of a Buzby Berkley nightmare. It is hysterical. I highly recommend watching an episode of Re:View from RedLetterMedia about the film. They articulate perfectly the degree of sheer fun of Gremlins 2 and beg anyone thinking about it NOT to make a third Gremlins film. I'll second that emotion.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

I ran into director Joe Dante at a Chicago film festival program honoring his work 2 years ago and learned that he made Gremlins 2 as the sequel to end all sequels.

The movie is not terrible, but it is not good either, and I bet if they made this movie more like the first Gremlins, then I would be giving it a perfect score right now.

114,mrusty5,A Sequel Worth Watching,10,6 October 2008,"Gremlins was a film I never really considered watching but when I did, I thought it was brilliant; a little scary but great. I was unaware there was a sequel until I watched Cinemassacre's (The Angry Video Game Nerd) review of the films. I liked the look of the second film so I bought the film boxset online and watched the films. Gremlins 2: The New Batch is awesome.Everything about it is brilliant. The story, the characters, all the gags and film references and the Gremlins themselves. The filmmakers knew that Gremlins 2 would never beat the original so they made fun of the film itself. Some notable references included an angry parent dragging her child out of the cinema and complaining. A film critic gives a negative review on Gremlins and gets beaten up by the monsters as punishment. There some great film references including Batman, The Wizard of Oz and Rambo.At one point the Gremlins even destroy the film and start making shadow puppets on screen, prompting Hulk Hogan to scare them into fixing the film.The film's plot involves Gizmo, the cute mogwai from the first film, being taken to the Clamp Enterprises in New York after his owner died. Escaping becoming a lab rat with help from his friend Billy Peltzer and his girlfriend Kate, Gizmo ends getting wet and spawns a new batch of Gremlins. The first group consist of grouchy George, bucktoothed Lenny, crazy nutcase Daffy, and Mohawk, a reincarnation of Stripe from the first film. As expected, the Gremlins cause havoc in the building with lots of gags, the Gremlins spawning into dozens of Gremlins when they blow up a microwave and set of a sprinkler system.The building they're in is very modern allowing the Gremlins plenty of opportunities to cause mass destruction and mayhem. There's a genetics laboratory run by Christopher Lee where a group of Gremlins drink serums and gain wacky abilities. One becomes super smart, one grows bat wings, one becomes made of vegetables, one mimics the Phantom of the Opera, another becomes made of electricity and there's even one that becomes a woman Gremlin and flirts with Robert Picardo's character. Mohawk also gains a spider body. The film is really entertaining, but while it lacks the dark atmosphere of the first film, it still has plenty of great moments, some of which are disgusting but fun to watch. Some may consider the film's slapstick humour its downfall, but that doesn't stop them from watching and enjoying this film.If a third film was to be made, it would be interesting to see what the Gremlins could mess with in the 21st Century.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

It's funny, has some interesting Gremlin designs (The spider version of Mohawk is cool looking), great animatronic and puppet effects (they still hold up after nearly 19 years) and one of the most interesting versions of New York, New York ever sung in any film.Of course, the film breaks nearly three quarters of the way, but it's funny to see the gremlins make shadow puppets (especially the Abe Lincoln one- How on Earth did they do that?). On the other hand, the fake breaking of the film adds to the humor and is one of my favorite parts of the film.That scene alone contributes to the rating.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
116,cryofry,"Strange, weird, bizarre, brilliant",10,24 April 2005,"This movie came out when I was 5 years old. I remember the movie posters in the streets and the wacky preview for it on TV. I'm now 20 years old, and this is still one of my most favourite movies of all time. It's even better than the original, I believe. The reason I love it so much is because it is so damn strange. It really, really is! It's like a live action ""Looney Tunes"" episode. The gremlins are wacky, Gizmo is cute and mysterious, the human actors are all brilliant in their roles and the New York building setting is well, neat.The basic premise for this movie picks up a few years after the first ""Gremlins"" movie. This time however, it takes place in the busiest city on the planet, New York.The movie opens with the death of Gizmo's frail Chinese owner. In accordance with the owners death, the place where Gizmo is kept is demolished by a bulldozer and recking ball. Terrified, Gizmo flees from the building and into an alley where he is plucked up by a scientist and brought to the ""Clamp Cable Network"" building. The building belongs to media mogul Daniel Clamp and contains a vast variety of shops including: coffee houses, restaurants, dental clinics and science laboratories.Coincidentally, Billy and Kate are both working in the same building. Billy is in the art department and Kate gives guided tours of the building. It is here that they stumble upon Gizmo and the inevitable happens.I won't give anymore of the story line away. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I urge you to. It may not be brilliant in the eyes of the ""Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences"", but it is in my eyes. 10 stars!",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
117,Glorback,A movie that I just don't find very funny anymore.,5,28 January 2006,"I first watched Gremlins 2 at a pretty young age. Approximately 9 or 10, and despite not having watched the first movie at the time and not knowing what the hell was going on, I absolutely loved it. At my age, this stuff was the pinnacle of comedic genius. My cousin and I would rent it nearly every time one of us visited each other and we'd laugh the night away at it.But around the ages of 14, my cousin and I, having not watched the movie in quite a long time, picked it up again. And, well, it just didn't seem very funny this time. Sure, there are still a few things that still give me a chuckle, but the mad laughter is long gone.10-12 is probably the ideal age to enjoy this movie. Anyone younger will probably find it too frightening, and anyone older probably won't find it funny.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
118,gregyolen,"A brilliant, and underrated comedy",8,17 March 2010,"What I love about GREMLINS 2 THE NEW BATCH, is the fact that as a sequel, it fundamentally changes the format of its franchise – something even Spielberg's own sequels haven't ventured to do. (TEMPLE OF DOOM being the exception.) GREMLINS 2 THE NEW BATCH, is a film not made to the specifications of its original. Sure, the same rules apply to the little buggers, but this is a film that amps up the comedy of its premise to an almost Mel Brooksian level, while cutting back on the horror element of its significantly scarier predecessor. A wise decision; once you've seen the Gremlins metamorphose once, it's diminishing returns from there on out. Dante and writer Charlie Haas clearly understand this – so rather than duplicate beat-for-beat that thing that made them rich the first time, they take a different tack, essentially switching genre, and garnering superior, though less financially lucrative, results. That's called risk-taking. And it's something you don't frequently see in studio film-making.I have some more thoughts on the matter, too...

This movie is far worse than the first film, the first being mediocre and the second one's new subtitle suits it best! What makes this movie SO bad is the fact that the gremlins change versus the first movie, black gizmos, bad jokes, poor plot, and plot holes are VERY visible. This movie is sorta a copy of the original (plot wise) because in this movie there is an EXACT gremlin like the first one (Stripe) is back, except being a BLACK gremlin this time around.

But this sequel, unlike some others, changes the entire feel for what kind of movie it is. This one takes away all black comedy and horror which the first one had, and comes out ""dantielberg"" the quality of a Joe Dante animated feature, but with the Warner Bro's inflicked Spielberg family touch added.

The film is less dark than the original and in no way scary. I saw this film in 1990 and at that time I had not seen the first part yet so perhaps I did not have the expectations that some of fans of original had.I think the jokes are hilarious, the special effects are amazing and many performances are outstanding, especially John Glover is great as media tycoon Clamp (I love the 'Clamp' logo by the way...).

Gremlins 2: The New Batch is highly enjoyable, even if it very much abandoned the horror atmosphere that helped the first Gremlins movie be lively.Gremlins 2 shifted more to comedy and diminished on horror as reverse to the first Gremlins film. Everyone's favorite character Gizmo is perhaps the main reason why this movie was enjoyable for me to watch. There's even creativity and decoration on the new batch of Gremlins, such as Daffy, Lenny and George (parodying Of Mice and Men), The Electric Gremlin, Mohawk the Spider Gremlin, and best of all, the BRAIN Gremlin, who actually is popular among the fans of this movie. This film seems to have somewhat tapped into the future skyscraper view of the world where people are caught up in the time where the future is focused on advancing civilization's buildings and technology. There is a lot of energy and effort seen in how this movie was produced. Both the human characters, Gizmo, and the Gremlins are all as lively as possible, even improved on as from the 1st movie. Highly enjoyable and a perfect film.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

Gremlins came out and was a mildly good scary movie.Then there was Gremlins: The New Batch which was a parody of the first one and was not scary at all but actually made for a mildly good comedy.I would recommend this movie if you had seen the first Gremlins movie ... enjoyed it somewhat and were looking for a few laughs.Neither movie is the best at what they are trying to be ... the first one is a B rated horror flick and the second is a B rated comedy.Enjoy and Thanks for reading my review!,Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
127,Century_hades,Some things should just be left alone.,4,9 November 2014,"I just finished watching Gremlins 2, after I found it in the cheap movie bin at walmart. I remember seeing this one in the theatre back in 1990. It had the same affect on me as the Ghostbusters sequel.I saw the first one in theatres 6 years prior, and as a kid I loved the movie. I got sucked into the story, and cried at the end when they had to give gizmo back. It all took place in a small town, and it was a gem of a movie.Now I was 6 when I saw the first one, and flash forward six years later, and I'm on the verge of turning twelve when the sequel came out. Now 6 years is a long time in child years.So I had changed a lot, and my interest had changed. This sequel just didn't capture the magic a second time for me. I didn't like it, but at the time I couldn't put my finger on why I didn't like it.Now I can, I don't like the setting. Inside the high tech office building. Also this one is much less serious in tone then the first one. With the comedy going way more over the top. Where they break the third wall too many times for me, and it takes me out of the picture.Also the first one had such a sad, but nice ending. The first one is a great 80's film. One of the most memorable from that time.If your a fan of the first film then chances are you have seen this one, and if your not a fan of the first film. Then you most likely won't be bothered with this film at all.One last thing I'd like to add. This was a completely unnecessary sequel. The first one was a complete story, and adding anything more just waters things down. Some things should just be left alone.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

They were some of the greatest moments in cinematic history when the movie breaks the fourth wall several times and tries to appeal to the haters of the first one.I rate it 10 outta 10 because of nostalgic memories but fair and square it's a hard 7.5 in my book.

The animation for gizmo's dancing scene was hardly noticeable but still displeasing. Don't get me wrong, i still loved this movie, but it was not as good as #1. My last con is the gremlins interrupting the film. This was okay, but I think they could have gone without it(but I heard they got read of it in the DVD version.) The rest of the movie was done well and all the movie references were funny. The scene were the female lead is attacked in the elevator was cool and so was the scene were the other gremlins came into the picture.

Unfortunately i think this movie falls down due to the length of time they waited to make it, it doesn't seem like a sequel.Gremlins 2 is a very enjoyable sequel and i urge you to give it a view if you have never experienced it.

Fantastic! Give me the Geneva Convention as culture any day of the week.And who will forget the climatic ending, with the aforementioned greatest 90 seconds on celluloid as the Gremlins, poised to unleash their antics on New York City come nightfall, sing ""New York, New York"" in the lobby before being utterly destroyed?

I can remember seeing this film when it first came out 12 years ago, and while as a 10 year old i loved it, it wasn't until i was older that i realized how many jokes and gags went over my head in 1990, that i found hilarious many years later.This movie, although enjoyed by kids, is really meant for adults who loved the first one.Gremlins 2 - The New Batch, is a must rent, and will probably join my DVD collection when it is released later this year (August 20th, I believe)",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch

Not that carnage and destruction are all that it has going for it; ""Gremlins 2"" is still cute enough to be enjoyed by the whole family. Gizmo, the cuddly protagonist that accidently spawns the malicious monsters makes you melt every time his big eyes fill the screen, and the gremlins themselves are having too much fun being naughty to be taken seriously, especially when they start destroying a lab and mutating into new species.

137,dl-24,Best Film of the Year,10,29 December 2004,"Not kidding. Gremlins 2 was the best reviewed film of the year according to Premier Magazine, averaging 3 1/2 stars. To really appreciate the film, you've got to have a wild sense of humor and be a real movie lover with a good knowledge of filmdom -- otherwise you'll miss all the homages to great films of the past. I got to meet Director Joe Dante at the Chicago Film Festival's showing of ""Gremlins 2"" and his incredibly warm film ""Matinee"" where he confirmed that he intended Gremlins 2 to be the sequel to end all sequels. The studio required him to make a sequel to the more financially -- but less artistically -- successful ""Gremlins"" before it would finance any other films by Dante. The result gives us Tony Randall in his finest role as the intellectual Gremlin and Robert Picardo in his best pre-""Star Trek: Voyager"" performance. Christopher Lee wonderfully satirizes his horror film roles of the past as Donald Trump and Ted Turner take it on the chin with John Glovers parody as Daniel Clamp.

This movie surpasses films like Godfather 2, Citizen Kane, or even Casablanca and makes those films look like children's movies as this feature outshines them with its symbolism and clever writing. The special effects of this movie are far beyond James Cameron's Avatar and make most modern CGI movies look like clip art. The main actor and actress bring so much personality into the Gremlins Cinematic Universe. Overall, this film extends the lore of the GCU (Gremlins Cinematic Universe), expanding on every detail. The characters' struggles with containing the gremlins is representing our own struggles with bottling up our own demons. Joe Dante is truely the best director and his work like this shows it.

I've always found it to be much better than the original for a few key reasons: 1. This movie does not take itself seriously. Gremlins went for straight horror, but was ineffective because it was so funny... in the bad way.2. There is a tidal wave of movie in-jokes, from the classics to even the first Gremlins. You'll more than likely laugh at a new joke you didn't notice before every single time you see it 3.

Ironically the only really cool part was when they mock the paradoxes of the original 'What if the creature is eating on an airplane and they enter a different time zone, I mean its always after-midnight somewhere ', Okay, I guess the talking Gremlin was wickedly cruel and funny, but the rest of the gremlins were painfully annoying beyond threshold.

What was actually produced was the brilliant solution - a more maniacal, more humourous, but over all a self-parodying masterpiece. It works so well because it completely breaks the rules  - spoofing itself, even referring to the original, and having the Gremlins eat the film itself. Christopher Lee is a charm, Phoebe Cates is brilliant (and gorgeous) - watch out for her 'childhood trauma' recollection which is a sheer, blatant stab at her character's explanation of why she hates Christmas in the first film, Havilland Morris is a classic (why isn't she famous by now?), John Glover, Robert Prosky and Kathleen Freeman are also superb.

I really didn't like the idea of the gremlins metamorphosing and I HATED the intelligent gremlin. I pretty much didn't appreciated the movie. at that age, I would have give it a 5 maybe 6 on 10.After renting the first one a LOAD of times, I decided to rent Gremlins 2 again. I was about 7 ans a half.I remember that I still didn't thought it was really good but I had a better opinion on the movie. So I rented it again ... and again ... and again ... and a... .

You could argue the Muppets do a good job, but when do the Muppets use big words like ""civilazation"" or those weird Latin words for the ""Bat Gremlin.""

This director was Joe Dante, and this movie was Gremlins 2: The New Batch.Using a creative satire, Mr. Dante cleverly marketed a brilliant commentary on the political climate of the time and the illusion of happiness which the powers of marketing tell us we are. Dark and sinister, but playful in a way, Gremlins represent the free-thinking part of society, the individuals who want to make their own choices and their own rules. Even the ""bad guys"", the corporate elite, were good guys compared to the Gremlins. Billy and Kate represent the undecided voters, the middle of the road average citizen, the one that WANTS to be the good person, that tries to UNDERSTAND someone or something different, but also fear change. By using the duality of the Mogwai vs the Gremlins, the director poses the most fundamental message put upon the American public...good, or evil? No gray area, one choice defeats the other, a common method of controlling the populace in a politically charged climate.Beginning with the transformation of the Gremlin with the wings, then given the ability to fly in sunlight, then meeting a quick and uneventful death, created the imagery of the government saying, ""Do not spread your wings. Do not attempt to fly."" For five minutes, probably the most beautiful five minutes of its life, this creature experienced true happiness. Until it was torn down from the sky by an old man resistant to change as a herd of people stood around and watched, and did nothing. A Gremlin, trying to be different, trying to be happy, trying to live his life the way he wanted to live it. And murdered for it as soon as he didn't toe the line.Intellegently, Mr. Dante used the happy, ""white"", upper-middle class vs. the ""dark"", boozing, gun toting ""monsters"" to illustrate social and racial disparity across America and common, hurtful misconceptions that go along with preconceived notions of what the people across the bridge are like. Can we really condemn the whole Gremlins species because of the acts of a few radicals? I say no.In conclusion, Gremlins 2: The New Batch is a fun and goofy movie for the whole family! The kids will love the costumes and the dance scene at the end was SOOO fun!! Ohhh...and the SPIDER gremlin! Wow! How scary, haha!",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
154,electro-71748,Rivals The Original,8,2 January 2016,"Another Gremlins movie filled with chaos and fun that for some reason, is usually thought of as a bad movie! I don't understand why so many people don't like this film. If anything it should be thought as on the same level of good as the first. Gremlins 2 does exactly what you would want from a Gremlins sequel, it ups the chaos, introduces new and memorable gremlins such as Mohawk, Greta and Brain, and explores all new possibilities, such as mutant gremlins. But it doesn't just rely on the gremlins for it's comedy, it also has many extremely funny moments in how it does satire of TV and large corporations. It even makes fun of itself, making jokes based on problems from the original and the concept of the Gremlins. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the original film.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
155,m_p-1,"Fantastic, man. This movie makes me explode with joy.",8,16 August 2005,"For those few who haven't seen this, its tone is significantly different than the first ""Gremlins"" in that comedy was a primary goal, horror more secondary. If you're looking for highbrow humor, you're looking in the wrong place, but I get the idea that the filmmakers came up with exactly what they wanted- the jokes and gags are at times extraordinarily effective. Acting is often way over the top, delightfully so. The new individuality of the gremlins helped keep it more interesting, and they totally become the collective star of the show.Here's my small spoiler:***The musical scene near the end was truly one of the most glorious moments in film history.*** It almost made me pee my pants.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
156,stacey-lynne,Horrible Sequel,3,3 October 2019,"I am honestly surprised to see so many positive reviews of this movie. There is nothing redeeming here. In fact, the entire movie seems to be a parody of the original, as if director Joe Dante hated Gremlins and decided to make a huge budget movie that made fun of it.The plot is non-existent: The main characters simply run amok to the backdrop of ridiculous gremlin antics. The old Chinese man disappears completely from the film for no apparent reason after the opening scenes. The gremlins themselves are childish, ludicrous caricatures of what we saw in the first movie, replete with googly eyes and cartoonish facial expressions. And throughout all of the ""in-jokes"" and ""puns"", they never quite get around to explaining why all of the mogwai are evil except for Gizmo. But by all means lets have a scene where Phoebe Cates puns her character's traumatizing Christmas story.I looked for something- something- to help boost the rating here. There isn't much beyond decent effects and getting Zach Galligan a nice paycheck.If you liked Gremlins, my advice is to forget there ever was a sequel and just enjoy the original.",Gremlins 2 - The New Batch
