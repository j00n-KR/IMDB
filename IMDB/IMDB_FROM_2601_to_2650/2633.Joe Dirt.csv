0,SnoopyStyle,"hated Dennis Miller, David Spade alright",5,2 September 2014,"Joe Dirt (David Spade) is a dirty janitor working in a Hollywood radio station. DJ Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller) interviews him for his show. Joe starts recalling his life since being lost at the Grand Canyon at the age of 8 (Erik Per Sullivan). He helps country girl Brandy (Brittany Daniel) get her dog's frozen balls off the porch. They become best of friends but he eventually leaves to search for his family. He befriends a soft spoken Indian Kicking Wing (Adam Beach). As a carnie, he catches the eye of trashy Jill (Jaime Pressly).I really hated Dennis Miller in this. I can't stand him and his fake radio show. It puts me off the movie right away. David Spade is somewhat likable. He's not really funny but he has some marginal charm. I would rather have just a straight up Joe Dirt adventure with his girl Brandy and sidekick Kicking Wing.",Joe Dirt
1,ccthemovieman-1,Ya Gotta Love 'Joe Dirt',8,10 July 2006,"For a typical low-brained Hollywood comedy of this era, it was a pretty nice film. Of course, few if any modern-day comedies are ""family fare"" and this one isn't either but the lead character is a gentle, harmless guy. David Spade is very entertaining as ""Joe Dirt,"" a down-and-out nice guy (but not exactly pure, either) who tells his tale of trying to find his parents to sleazy disc jockey ""Zander Kelly"" (Dennis Miller). Brittany Daniel is an attractive, likable female lead.It's a fast-moving hour-and-a-half. Some of the scenes are outrageous, such as a dog getting his - can I say this? - testicles stuck to the porch. Yes, it's good family fare!! Ha. Ha. No, really, this was a funny film and worth looking for if you need a laugh. I'm surprised there wasn't a sequel.",Joe Dirt
2,Quinoa1984,It has some very nice and funny moments,5,12 April 2001,"David Spade plays the hero of Joe Dirt in Joe Dirt as a white trash guy so white trash he has a white trash beard.  His saga has him on a radio show with Sir Dennis Miller, as he tells his story of how he was lost at the grand canyon at 8, and has spent his whole life looking for his parents. 
The film is sporadically funny with Spade in fine form, even if the film at times is not as funny as it is overly-dumb.  Still, there are the moments, in particular with every scene with Miller, Kid Rock (even if he might be a tad overrated) and Christopher Walken who gives the film it's best lines. Another nice thing by the way, the film has heart, which not too many SNL films have.  B",Joe Dirt

4,zardoz-13,"""Joe Dirt"" rises among the sod!",8,11 July 2007,"Nice guys finish first in ""Joe Dirt."" This lowbrow, redneck, laugh fest grounds itself in the rude, crude, lewd, bowel movement-oriented gross-out gags of comedian Adam Sandler. Not surprisingly, Sandler's production company 'Happy Madison,' which also made ""Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo,"" produced ""Joe Dirt."" Predictably, ""Joe Dirt"" (*** out of ****) appeals to the mentality of an 8-year old in its fixation with all kinds of fecal matter, fart jokes , and big-breasted babes. Strictly speaking, guys more than gals will guffaw at the juvenile escapades of our eponymous character. Although scatological humor dominates this picaresque tale about our thirty something protagonist's search for the ungrateful parents who abandoned him at age 8 at the Grand Canyon, David Spade's sympathetic but half- witted hillbilly hero towers memorably above those lowest-common-denominator-jests. Aside from Dennis Miller's hilarious but obnoxious jeers at Joe's appearance and pedigree, ""Joe Dirt"" shuns mean-spirited melodramatics and contents itself with showing how our resilient hero bounces back from more hurts than anybody should have to endure.Unlike many ""Saturday Night Live"" TV spin-off features, freshman director Dennie Gordon's ""Joe Dirt"" succeeds because the David Spade & Fred Wolf screenplay features an actual story. Moreover, instead of making the jokes as he has done in the past, David Spade becomes the butt of all the jokes. Everybody slings mud at Joe Dirt. Spade's character resembles Buster Keaton caught in an Adam Sandler comedy playing Rob Schneider pranks. Rarely does anybody get Joe Dirt's goat because he acts so incredibly ignorant that he doesn't know when somebody has been done him dirty. Our underdog hero displays so much heart you can't help but like him. You'll understand when you get a glimpse at this mullet-headed misfit. His mendacious mom made him wear a rock'n roll star's wig because she told him he lost the top of his skull at birth! ""So, you dig looking like Jane Fonda in 'Klute?'"" one of Joe's callous critics ridicules him. Joe sports pork chop sideburns and reads Auto Trader magazine as if it were Playboy. He dresses tattered, acid-washed jeans and rock group T-shirts, and drives a 1970's pathetic puke-yellow Barracuda with a chain steering wheel and a footprint gas pedal. Predictably, clouds of oily white smoke belch from his ride's tailpipe. Basically, Joe is blue-collar material, the world's worst loser who triumphs against all odds in the end. He lives by a simple philosophy: ""all I have to do is keep being a good person and good things will come my way.""Joe is mopping floors at Los Angeles radio station KXLA where Howard Stern-style shock jock Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller of ""Bordello of Blood"") works when one of his producers spots Joe. No sooner has Zander seen and heard Joe than he invites him as a guest on his show. During next four days, Joe recounts the events that brought him to Los Angeles while enduring Kelly's worse jibes. After Joe's parents abandon him in a trash can at the Grand Canyon in 1975, our hero lives by his wits in the woods until a beautiful country girl, Brandy (Brittany Daniel of ""Basketball Diaries"") befriends him. Their meeting occurs under the oddest circumstances, one evening when Joe finds her dog has somehow gotten his testicles frozen to her porch. Every time the poor critter moves, his scrotum stretches like taffy while his testicles remain stuck to the porch. Joe uses warm water and a spatula to free the grateful dog. Naturally, Brandy rewards him, and the two become close friends. Meanwhile, a local bully, Robby (Kid Rock), who drives a Trans-Am, and Brandy's own redneck papa (Joe Don Baker of ""Walking Tall"") do everything to run Joe off. After Brandy's worthless father shoots her dog, Joe decides it's time to begin his search for his parents. He drives off with the dog's ashes in an urn suspended from the inside rear-view mirror of his car.Along the road to L.A., Joe encounters a variety of eccentric characters. He discovers a la George Romeo's 1982 ""Creepshow"" what he believes is a flaming meteor. Instead, he learns it is large heap of frozen waste matter from a jetliner. The scenes of Joe hauling the alleged meteor around in a little red wagon are hilarious because we believe it is a meteor, too, until a pawnshop owner points out the peanut. Later, Joe meets Kicking Wing (Adam Beach of ""Mystery, Alaska""), an American Indian who sells only sparklers. Joe wants to hire him to track down his folks. At the same time, he convinces Kicking Wing to expand his fireworks business and sell more than sparklers. The highlight of their exploits involves an atomic bomb they think they have found that turns out to be a septic tank. Inevitably, Joe gets drenched with sewage. In another sidesplitting scene, Joe stumbles on to a ""Silence of the Lambs"" Buffalo Bob wannabe serial killer (Brian Thompson of ""Sudden Impact"") and runs into a janitor (Christopher Walken of ""Sleepy Hollow"") in the Witness Protection Program. Probably the best computer-generated graphics appear in the vignette at Rosanna Arquette's alligator farm. Joe sticks his head into a gator's jaws and gets all shook up for a crowd of tourists.Veteran TV director Dennie Gordon of ""Ally McBeal"" and ""Nash Bridges,"" strings this anthology of antics together and miraculously manages to make it work. Gordon knows when to resort to crude jokes and when to focus on Joe's underdog status, and she gets the most out of the least. Other amusing tidbits of Joe Dirt's philosophy that stick are ""Life is a garden, dig it."" Although Joe shares obstacles similar to Forrest's, he isn't really on the same wavelength. One thing nobody can complain about is the collection of classic rock songs that make the soundtrack. If a soundtrack were ever worth buying, the ""Joe Dirt"" is. Meanwhile, don't believe the snotty critics who are shoveling manure on this merry little movie, ""Joe Dirt"" rises among the sod.",Joe Dirt
5,view_and_review,Joe Dirt: King of the mullets,8,25 January 2007,"I just happened to catch this movie on television while visiting my dad. I wasn't watching for any other reason than it was on. I was quickly engrossed in the movie... it was hilarious. I know that some of the humor, if not all of the humor, was a bit juvenile and sophomoric, but I found it amazingly funny.Joe Dirt is a poor, dumb, southern hick with a permanent mullet sewn into his skull because he was born with no scalp... priceless!! David Spade plays the lovable loser whose sole goal the entire movie is to find his parents. On his journey to find his parents he goes through one comical ordeal after another. Even though David Spade is amusing anyway, this movie could have been just as funny with someone else playing the lead; it was that hilarious.This movie really takes a shot at rednecks and trailer trash. Of course there is some cliché and stereotypical stuff in there as can be expected, but it was done in a way to keep you laughing.",Joe Dirt
6,anaconda-40658,Dirt is the Correct Word.,1,3 June 2015,"Joe Dirt (2001): Dir: Dennie Gordon / Cast: David Spade, Dennis Miller, Christopher Walken, Rosanna Arquette, Kid Rock: Joe Dirt proudly wheels a meteor down the street on a wagon. While eating his lunch on top of it, he makes ownership promises unaware that his suppose discovery is a large chunk of toilet waste. He is a white trash janitor abandoned by his parents and tells his story via radio. Director Dennie Gordon shows little promise as one idiotic scene follows another. Joe eventually finds his parents and discovers that they knew what viewers were aware of from the get go. David Spade is totally unsympathetic. Joe Dirt is even dumber than the poop scooping moron he played in Lost and Found. As a radio personality Dennis Miller appears anxious for Spade to say something remotely intelligent. Christopher Walken has the thankless role as a janitor in hiding. He should go into hiding after agreeing to be part of this junk. Rosanna Arquette appears at an alligator farm. Crude moments include dog testicles frozen to a patio. Kid Rock puts down his guitar to give us perhaps his biggest career blunder in appearing in what comes off as a really bad joke at his expense. Spade gets drenched in sewage, which is exactly where the film should be. Finally we are given a sex scene where he screams out, ""Sister!"" While locations are innovative, the witless screenplay lurks in the gutter. Better yet, dirt. Score: 1 / 10",Joe Dirt
7,elo-equipamentos,Cutting-edge comedy with keen originality !!!,7,8 September 2020,"I shall not be hypocrite, these movies weren't my field of interest, but somehow Dirty Joe goes beyond of a simple teen comedy, it's fresh and original, it's a fact, thereby it catchs me, a little boy who lost your parents during a tourist travel at Grand Canyon sounds silly, but in your searching for them never stop, when he has an opportunity to telling his odd story broadcasting by a Los Angeles radio draw attention of the whole country, along his journey he meets with colorful and weird characters, the native Indian Kicking Wind, the mobster Clem, the rapist Buffalo Bob and his first love Brandy, many smart gags comes over, some of sexual nature, suggesting that him really was sexually abused by Buffalo Bob, or about being a queer guy, just kidding he really is straight, although rising some nasty comments, otherwise it won't enough funny, as a hard fan of Def Leppard exposes a rock vein, that were suggested in many scenes as AC/DC, Van Halen, Lynyrd Skynyrd just named a few, connected with a fine soundtrack with rock oriented helps too much, between many silliness stand out a cutting-edge comedy, for all ages by the way!!Resume:

8,StevePulaski,"Can't recommend the picture solely on the hairstyle, so...",3,27 May 2012,"The Happy Madison formula is one I am growing to wholeheartedly detest. It is becoming so much of a muchness I begin to dub their films as ""anti-character studies,"" meaning they always focus on such a degenerate of a human that it becomes impossible to laugh at them during their misfortunes. Happy Gilmore, I felt toyed with, given a character who screams and yells and is clearly in need of some mental help, and felt like I was a bully laughing at a character who wasn't all there. Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star left me disgusted that such an inhumane, inept, and socially unacceptable character had gotten his own feature length film and was doing things that didn't constitute for human on any social level to laugh at, that I nearly lost all faith that a good movie could ever be made by anyone even involved in the film. And as for The Waterboy, all I can say the character was easily the most unlikable of the unlikable for that year.Joe Dirt is more of the same formula, only manipulated slightly. Construct a character, ugly, indecent, and such an easy target for bullying and make him the lead character in a comedy so we can follow him along on one contrivance after another just to watch the poor sap become the butt of every joke. The manipulation of the Madison formula comes stems from the Joe Dirt character himself, who is mildly likable for one reason; he is not abusive, violent, or incorrigible. He has been given every form of hell, that his way of closure is just peacefulness and passiveness. He can actually be a fairly suitable misfit role model for Bucky, Happy, and the Waterboy, although that may be pushing it.But on with the movie; David Spade is Joe Dirt, in an unfortunate role after two hilarious ones in both Black Sheep and Tommy Boy. He is the hardcore, outrageous, mullet-headed (it's a wig by the way, since apparently he was born with a cracked skull) dolt who works as a custodian for an LA radio station, and resides in the luxurious boiler room of the joint. In a spur of the moment decision, Joe Dirt is forced to join the verbally abusive shock-jock Zander Kelly (Miller) on the radio (the character seems to have picked up David Spade's smart-ass qualities from Tommy Boy pretty well), where he is forced into talking about his life over the course of the next few days live on air.So we are presented with flashbacks with occasional interruptions of Dirt's childhood, where he was abandoned at the Grand Canyon by his parents, when he met the most beautiful girl in the world (Daniel) and her mean-spirited boyfriend (Kid Rock), along with trying to cope in a world where he is unwanted.The audience can vaguely side with the man because he is one of the few Happy Madison anti-character studies that doesn't make humor out of the character bringing things on himself. Instead, it focuses on the idiotic things the character says throughout the picture as a means to act tough and make humor out of the contentious interactions he has with others. He is an inept idiot, and one that confuses the audience. This is where the paradox of Madison films comes to life; we are supposed to root for this character during oppressive times, yet laugh when he is made fun of.David Spade is fine as the character, sometimes but rarely striking any laughs, and the atmosphere is muggy and brutal, like in many Sandler films. Sandler is not in the film, but has a producer's credit on it, and many of his regulars like Allen Covert and Kevin Nealon make quick appearances in, so the film replicates the close to home feeling they always have.I suppose if you have liked previous Sandler features, you're likely to enjoy this one. The main problem with Joe Dirt is, like its character, it is so desperate for attention that it will go to great lengths to achieve it, never erecting some form of credible discipline. The script becomes monotonous, as the character collides and travels down the long, straight road to the next comedy setup, the jokes are mild, unoffensive, and muted because of the rating, and Spade's performance is less than commendable. Although I wouldn't mind seeing that hairstyle again.Starring: David Spade, Dennis Miller, Brittany Daniel, Kid Rock, Allen Covert, Kevin Nealon, and Christopher Walken. Directed by: Dennis Gordon.",Joe Dirt
9,=G=,Awful.,4,29 August 2001,"In ""Joe Dirt"", Spade appears to be trying to create a loveable loser folk hero while telling of the character's odyssey-like search for his parents in a radio interview conducted by Dennis Miller. An unfortunate make-it-up-as-you-go junk comedy, ""Joe Dirt"" is sorely bereft of creativity and humor and wears itself out early on with nary a LOL to be found. Recommended only for die-hard Spade fans...if there is such a thing.",Joe Dirt

The soundtrack is so damn good and the lines through out especially by David Spade are so good! Beyond hilarious and so much fun! Who ever came up with this is awesome, I love anyone that doesn't mind Joe Dirt. Maybe I am weird, I do have ASD, although I don't like to admit that much. The scene making spoofed Silence of the Lambs is great. The enthusiasm is so heartwarming!!",Joe Dirt
12,Anonymous_Maxine,Poor Kid Rock.,4,14 January 2003,"A movie like The Adventures of Joe Dirt is not the kind of movie that is going to trick you into thinking that it is something worth watching, the way movies like Armageddon try to. David Spade is almost universally associated with low thought comedies, but like Joe Dirt, these are not always all bad. Joe Dirt is the type of movie that comes across as a goofball comedy that is not likely to be very believable and certainly will not promote much cognitive activity, but I respect it because there is a place in the entertainment industry for movies like Joe Dirt. There is a place for bad comedy in the movies, and the reason that I don't hold Joe Dirt's status as a bad comedy against it is because it doesn't try to be anything else. There are so many movies these days that could so easily have slipped comfortably in with this country's truly great films had it not been for the addition of stupid, stupid love stories or idiot comic relief (a glaring recent example being Pearl Harbor) that it's refreshing to see one come along every once in a while that knows where it stands.That being said, I would like to also point out that I certainly have little to no respect for Joe Dirt outside of knowing its place. It is a comedy full of bad jokes that either are looking for a cheap laugh or, in a disturbing amount of occasions, are making jokes about things that really shouldn't be joked about. The movie is about a guy named Joe Dirt who is proudly the most redneck person you could ever hope to meet, whose parents abandoned him at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old. It is not that easy in this country for an 8 year old to get through life on his own, but mostly because it would not be too long before he was picked off the streets by a shelter or the police or any number of institutions. I doubt that he lived in the woods until he was old enough to pretend he had enough of an address to get a job, although that would certainly account for many things about his appearance and demeanor.After being noticed by a radio show that badly needed some sucker to laugh at for a few hours, Joe gets a spot on the radio show talking about his life, which at first starts out as a hilarious joke for the DJ (Dennis Miller), but ends up capturing the heart of the DJ and the audience and earning Joe several more days of air time to tell his story. He talks of when he went out in search of his real parents, leaving us already aware that he didn't find them or didn't care to know them once he had met them (given the fact that he still seemed pretty parentless), at first accurately portraying what a pathetic person he is, but ultimately his struggle becomes apparent and he starts to come across as some weird sort of tragic hero. Well, a goofy comedy's version of a tragic hero, anyway.As has been one of Spade's most prevalent skills throughout his career, in Joe Dirt he capitalizes on his weaknesses, making us laugh at how pathetic Joe Dirt is and, at the same time, how easily Spade can portray this kind of person. Kid Rock has a bit part as anther redneck who is trying to steal away from Dirt a stunningly attractive blonde who has probably the most inexplicable attraction to any person in any film in the last 20 or 30 years. This might be considered the point in the film where it switches from the realm of mil romantic comedy and goes full force into the world of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.Kid Rock plays a character that he is familiar with in real life, a tire-squealing redneck with little to no education and the total conviction that he is the coolest thing on earth. Unfortunately, by playing this character, he emphasizes the already prevalent detail that his taking a role in this film is an obvious attempt to switch over to acting and away from his flailing musical career. Overall, Joe Dirt has it positive moments. There were parts of the movie that were genuinely amusing (although not very many at all), but unfortunately there were also an enormous amount of parts that were supposed to be funny but were not even by the furthest stretch of the imagination (such as anything involving septic tanks shaped like missiles and buried mysteriously in the desert or anything about Joe's exposed brain).Someone thought, for example, that it would be amusing to have Joe Dirt say that he was born without the top of his skull, with his brain exposed, which completely mystifies me. This is a completely backwards step in developing the character of Joe Dirt (who they are trying to present as a normal guy underneath his astonishingly dorky exterior), and more importantly, it's not at all amusing, it's a horrible way to try to generate gross out humor. Maybe the writers forgot that people in real life are born like that. Maybe Joe, unlike the writers, sacrificed the top of his skull at birth for some sort of care for his fellow human being, and on top of that (no pun intended, of course), they throw in a hideous mullet wig that Joe has miraculously worn all his life.So let's recap, Joe Dirt was born without the top of his skull, he was fitted with the most repulsive wig that must have fallen out of the 1970s, he was abandoned by his parents at the age of eight, and now spends his life mopping floors and being laughed at by anyone he comes into contact with (including us). When you consider the human side of the movie, the comedy drains away, which is ironic since the human side is exactly the part of Joe Dirt that the movie tries to bring to light. Joe eventually finds his parents, only to discover from them within a matter of minutes and while surrounded by TV cameras that okay, okay, they left him at the Grand Canyon on purpose, leaving us with the feeling that the last hour and a half was a complete waste and the feeling that, had the writers not so obviously been complete morons, Joe Dirt really had the chance to have been a worthwhile comedy. A slim chance, but a chance nonetheless.",Joe Dirt
13,triple8,Great premise but the disgustingness of some of the jokes ruined it for me.,2,27 June 2004,"Let me begin by saying I thought the concept was quite good. I'll also say I liked Joe Dirt himself, he was hilarious and odd as he was, there was something strangely appealing about him. This is the type of movie that would normally appeal to me but the strength of the movie's premise was brought down by one bad joke after another.Why do so many comedies with really good premises feel the need to go off into stupidland with nonstop bad barf jokes and cruel humor? I wanted to enjoy this but the crudeness and cruelty of some of the jokes started to make me actually queasy. There's funny and then there's just plain gross. The subject matter was interesting enough, the acting good enough and the characters plentiful and colorful enough so that the bad humor wasn't needed-or at least so much of it. I found a lot to like in the movie and so might someone who hasn't yet seen it but if one doesn't have a high tolerance for this kind of ""gross out humor"" I don't see how one can really get into this.The best thing, for me was Joe Dirt himself who was funny enough alone. There was so much here that wasn't funny, merely disgusting and crude that I could never I don't think watch it again unless I fast forward through many scenes. In spite of the horrible unfunny humor though, if one has a strong stomach and can handle the constant gross out stuff they might like this rather odd tale. I can't argue with the acting or the premise but this is not good as a pure comedy. My rating is, sadly 2 out of 10.",Joe Dirt
14,PredragReviews,"Life's a garden,dig it!",7,5 May 2016,"Joe Dirt is a classic white trash trailer dude, that gets lost at the Grand Canyon when he's a kid. He tells his story of where he is today. A janitor at a radio station. The station ends up broadcasting his story and it ends up getting the listeners interested and becomes famous. This story is very humorous and has a bit of a love story in it.Yes, the humor is silly and often intentionally stupid, but I can't help but love it. If it's more cerebral or subtle humor that you want, you will not find it here (beyond the excellent mantra: ""life is a garden, dig it,"" that is). The Joe Dirt experience is all about good laughs from silly jokes, wacky characters and ridiculous situations. Highly recommended for those who like 70's rock, nostalgic hair styles, and anyone who pulls for the underdog. Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Joe Dirt
15,Chase_Witherspoon,Joe Deertay rocks more than the kid,7,5 April 2012,"Forgive the title and you should find a warm, funny film that concerns an unfortunate yokel with a permanent mullet hairstyle (Spade) working as a cleaner at a radio station when a prominent DJ (Miller) sees the opportunity to exploit his pathetic story for the ratings of his drive-time programme. But the sorrowful tale earns a cult following as Dirt re-acquaints with his first romance (Daniel) and encounters an assortment of weirdos as he seeks to discover the disappearance of his parents when he was a child.Although in some passages Spade is perhaps too smart for his own good, he still pulls off the likable but hopelessly pitiful Joe Dirt (or Deertay as he pronounces it), and his encounters with Christopher Walken as a former mob boss in the witness protection programme, Brian Thompson as a creepy Buffalo Bill serial killer a la ""Silence of the Lambs"", and future ""My Name is Earl"" trailer trash Jaime Pressly as a carney with whom he's sleeping and who might just be his sister (which prompts an hilarious scene).There's a number of memorable moments as Joe gets pushed around by the thugs of this world, while his endearing personality reaches out and inspires the rest, a champion for the underdog, as they befriend and protect him from further embarrassment and humiliation. The ending is satisfying and overall the movie hits the right note, merging good humour with dollops of sympathy, sincerity and even a couple of moving moments. Not what you'd expect from the title and personnel and well worth a look.",Joe Dirt
16,DJAkin,"Move over Steve Martin, JOE DIRT is in town!!",7,17 September 2003,This movie was worth all nine dollars that I spent on it at the local store.

17,vithiet,Another classic I enjoyed more than I thought I would.,7,19 July 2021,"This has been on my list to watch for the last 20 years because people kept recommending it but there was little about it that sounded appealing to me... that and also pretty poor reviews. So maybe that's because I went in with low expectations I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, there is a lot that got some eye rolling from me, but I found myself laughing a few times and overall having a good time watching it. Another silly comedy that knew exactly what it was and delivers a tad more than it actually promised.",Joe Dirt
18,mattymatt4ever,Surprisingly good!,7,28 August 2001,"David Spade is not a bad comedian.  In fact, he is quite talented.  Another one of those comic actors who can be funny if given good material, but obnoxious if given lousy material.  He co-wrote and stars in this new SNL spin-off (though I haven't seen any of the sketches).  Compared to many of these SNL clunkers like ""Superstar"" and ""The Ladies' Man"" I found this comedy--though not hysterically funny--to be surprisingly refreshing.
First of all, it's a harmless comedy.  Aside from a few crude sight gags--one involving a dog's testicles getting stuck to a porch and another involving Spade getting human crap poured all over him--I found the film to be quite disciplined and not over-the-top.  Though the gags aren't Woody Allen material, they don't strive to rise to the top of the Crude-O-Meter and there are a good deal of laughs.  That's what you get when you spend a little time conjuring up what would work best in a scene, rather than scribble out the first cheap, predictable gag that comes to mind.  I'm surprised at Spade (who co-wrote the script) and didn't think he would go through with injecting some wit into his comedy.  Maybe all these other SNL alumni who choose the write and star in another movie could learn from him. And I never thought I would one day say that someone can actually learn from David Spade.The cast is great, too.  Christopher Walken has a nice little supporting role as a school janitor.  I would tell you more about his character, but I don't want to give anything away.  The point is Walken's the man!  He's one of those actors who dominates the screen whenever he's on and you think to yourself, ""Yeah!  Now we're cooking!""  The beautiful Brittany Daniel, who played Eve on ""Dawson's Creek,"" graces the screen and provides great eye candy.  And of course, the man himself--Kid Rock!--plays a small part.  I just wish Spade would've written his character as a musician.  I know that would be a poor excuse to have him perform one of his kick-a** songs, but who cares?!!  Dennis Miller is funny as always, playing the shock-jock who brought Joe to fame.  He plays a pretty significant role and appears in a good portion of the film, which is great since I'm a fan of Dennis' schtick.
""Joe Dirt"" is not a great movie.  At times it's lame, at times it's crude, but the key word is ""at times.""  The film often delivers, and though you may not be laughing the whole way, you will have a good time without having to withstand a barrage of crudeness and stupidity.  The plot is about as implausible as you can get, but for an entertaining comedy like this I'll let it slide.  Don't let the previews steer you away; ""Joe Dirt"" is good, clean fun.My score:  7 (out of 10)",Joe Dirt
19,Beta_Gallinger,"Funnier than ""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star"", but I still find myself giving it the same rating",5,29 August 2010,"I remember during my high school years, which ended just a few years ago, there was a classroom in the school with several movie posters up on the wall for some reason, and one of them was a ""Joe Dirt"" poster. That was how I first knew of this 2001 comedy's existence, a couple years after its release, but it would be years before I would actually see it. ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's song, ""Close but No Cigar"" was released in 2006, on his ""Straight Outta Lynwood"" album. The song is sung at the point of view of a guy who has been through three romantic relationships, all of which ended when he found the slightest excuse to break up with each of these women, and he dumped one of them when he discovered she owned a copy of ""Joe Dirt"" on DVD. However, even that reference didn't make me really want to check the movie out right away. It's been nearly four years since the release of that song, and about seven and a half years since I first saw that poster, but I've finally seen the movie. I saw ""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star"", another comedy starring David Spade, earlier this year, and unlike that film, I did find some laughs in this one, but still didn't think it was very good.Joe Dirt is a hapless idiot who currently works as a janitor for a Los Angeles radio station and lives in a studio boiler room. Dirt is the surname his father gave him, and he cannot remember what his real surname was. His mullet is a wig that is stuck on his head, and the mullet haircut has long since gone out of style, but he can't get rid of his. Zander Kelly is a shock jock who has a show on this L.A. station, and Joe is sent in to talk on this show so people can laugh at his expense. On this radio show, Joe begins to tell his life story to Zander and all the listeners tuned in to the station, and viewers of the movie see it in flashback. When Joe was eight years old, he went on a tour of the Grand Canyon with his parents and was somehow separated from them. He hasn't seen his parents since losing them on that trip, and still doesn't know what happened to them. After being raised in several different strange foster homes, he came to the town of Silvertown, Idaho as a young man, where he met a young woman named Brandy and fell in love. Unfortunately, he also had to face a bully there named Robby, who was also intent on winning Brandy's heart, and did not appreciate Joe's presence. After Brandy's dog was shot and killed by her drunk father, Joe felt the need to leave Silvertown and search for his long lost parents. Even though Zander continues to make fun of him, Joe tells the story of his search for his parents and his adventures along the way.When it comes to the gags here, there certainly are some highlights, such as Joe Dirt finding out what the ""meteor"" he found actually is, and the lead character using what he thinks is an atomic bomb to scare the Grand Canyon tour bus company into giving him the list of passengers from the day he lost his parents. There were times when I laughed thoroughly and other times when I laughed very lightly or maybe just smiled. However, there are also some memorably unfunny parts, such as certain scenes showing Joe being bullied. These include more than one scene with Robby, played by musician Kid Rock, and also the way Zander Kelly, played by Dennis Miller, picks on Joe while on the air. I also found the part where Joe finds the dog with his testicles frozen to the porch a little uncomfortable, even if I didn't keep a straight face throughout that sequence. I didn't care much for the part where what Joe thinks is an atomic bomb turns out to be a septic tank and pours sewage all over him, though I did find the fact that the police didn't arrest him because they thought that was punishment enough fairly amusing. Other parts I didn't find very funny include the Buffalo Bob/skin lotion one and Joe getting food thrown at him in a school cafeteria. So, there are a number of funny parts in the movie, probably more than I originally expected, but there are also some fairly lame ones, and the humour is just mediocre for much of the film's ninety minute run. There were times when I felt like I would be giving this 2001 Happy Madison production a 6/10, but by the end, I decided I couldn't do that. Yes, there are some funny parts and likable characters, plus there certainly are fairly touching moments towards the end, but if they had done a much better job with the humour, ""Joe Dirt"" would have turned out to be a much more entertaining movie.",Joe Dirt

21,Movie-12,So utterly painful i don't want to talk about it for that long. Zero Stars (out of four),1,20 April 2001,"JOE DIRT / (2001) Zero Stars (out of four)By Blake French:""Joe Dirt,"" is easily the worst movie of this year to date, with ""Saving Silverman,"" ""See Spot Run,"" and ""Down to Earth"" at a close second, third, and fourth place. This is an amazingly bad film, one of the few I can think of that doesn't improve on the chore of starring at a black screen for 93 minutes. ""Joe Dirt"" is a rehearse in walking through a pile of feel-good smut; a production with ample depravity of such retched proportions it is almost immeasurable. It is such a painfully awful experience, I really do not want to waste my time writing about it for that long.""Joe Dirt"" is brought to you by one of the most prestigious production companies out there-not! It is called Happy Madison. It is behind cinematic milestones such as ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" and ""Little Nicky."" Many of the people behind the scenes, including Adam Sandler as an executive producer, are no strangers to the SNL death sentence for movies. The film is also complete with the likes of  illustrious actors, including David Spade, whom himself has made several previous contenders for worst picture of the year, such as ""8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,"" and ""Lost & Found."" He may have finally secured a top rank with ""Joe Dirt."" David Spade is at the center of the film, in almost every damned scene-but of course he is: he co-wrote the movie, after all. The story, if you can call it that, follows a scrawny red-neck janitor at a local radio station. His parents, while on a trip to the Grand Canyon, see their opportunity and abandoned him at only eight years old. Since then, he has been picked on all of his life. We don't feel sorry for him, however, because the movie tries so hard to make us feel sorry for him. It holds a gun on us and forces us to pity this ""character."" That is not the way to induce empathy for a main character. Even if this concept did work, however, Spade always plays his character like he never gets the joke. We see this over and over, therefore, humor becomes repetitive humiliation, and, as we saw earlier this year in ""Say It Isn't So!,"" that is simply not funny.The radio station's popular, loud mouth, annoying talk show host, named Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller, from HBO's comedy series ""Dennis Miller Live""), discovers Joe and puts him on air for a few laughs. Then the plot mulls us through an agonizing history of Joe's misfortunes in life. His profound achievements range from his young love life, searching for his parents, ridicules by the local country boys, an encounter with an Indian (Adam Beach) who sells fireworks, a sexual adventure into the pants of who could be his long lost sister (Jamie Pressly), meeting of a local school custodian (Christopher Walken), and the owner of a small alligator farm (Rosanna Arquette). As I glanced through the credits at the joyous ending of the film, and studied the cast credits on the invaluable Internet Movie Database, I found it funny how actor Rosanna Arquette, who has a significant part in ""Joe Dirt,"" is unrecognized. Accident? Doubtful. Perhaps she withdrew her name from the credits due to the shame she may have felt after watching the overall product? I do not blame her. I would have done the same thing.The film is not without good intentions and a compassionate heart-or so we hear. ""I think kids need to see the message,"" quotes David Spade. ""Work hard and get what you want."" Ironic how Spade has so much confidence in the film's moral content. Since Joe is a hard worker, he is a great role model, right? But Mr. Spade, what about the scene where (spoiler ahead) Joe realizes the woman he just had sex with is not his sister. She states that they can have sex again, since he now knows he is not practising incest. When he cannot become excited, she decides to scream ""you're my sister"" repeatedly, stunningly arousing him as they once again have rough sex. Obviously Spade believes incest is wrong, but imagining incestuous deeds is a great deal of fun. This is the kind of character with the morals Spade believes ""kids need.""Throughout ""Joe Dirt"" we see more gross out humor than even the Farelly brothers could have created. There are the obligatory scenes in which Joe ends up as the target of other people's jokes, and his own stupidity. There are variations on the old ""poop"" jokes. One has Joe tied to a rocket, covered in feces (that looks like partially melted, flavorful, creamy, soft serve ice cream). In another, he treasures what he believes to be a comet, but turns out to be a hardened pile of excretion. Oh, yeah. And there is the disturbing scene where an innocent canine gets his genitals frozen to a porch. As the dog tries to stand, whimpering and whining, his manhood extends and becomes stretched. Funny? I don't think so. Even funnier is the caption at the end of the film that declares no animal was hurt during the production. No kidding? For a minute there I thought that the cheap, discolored, elastic looking rubber was actually the dog's scrotum there...",Joe Dirt

This film gave ma lot of laughs and I was expecting it to be a plain out stupid movie with no common sense in it at all. Well sure it had no common sense in it but it was not a stupid movie. I loved the scene when Kid Rock makes fun of him and he runs home like a little girl. That was hilarious and the part when that crazy psycho kept him inside that hole like in The Silence of the Lambs. You have to see this movie.

25,Cinemaniac1984,Enjoyable light hearted entertainment.,6,12 March 2015,"Joe Dirt is one of those comedies that you will either like or dislike, and I found myself pleasantly surprised that Joe Dirt was an enjoyable movie. It's not a great movie, but it does not deserve the negative reception.David Spade plays the titular Joe Dirt, who is a janitor working in a Los Angeles Radio station who everybody regards as a loser. When shock-jock radio host Zander Kelly played by Dennis Miller invites him on air to talk to him. From there Joe tells his story about being abandoned at the Grand Canyon by his parents at the age of 8 and his childhood spent in a series of foster homes. Joe Dirt's story wins over listeners and Joe gains a large fan base as well as a new group of friends who like him for who he is, including an old childhood friend of Joe's named Brandy played by Brittany Daniel, a high school janitor with a mysterious past named Clem played by Christopher Walken, and an Indian tracker who calls himself Kicking Wing played by Adam Beach.Sure Joe Dirt is not the greatest movie out there, but by no means that it is a bad movie.

26,jts0405,A Hilarious Movie for Spade,8,31 October 2008,"David Spade is normally seen as the second man in all major comedy movies such as Tommy Boy and more recently The Benchwarmers. But this movie as well as Dickie Roberts really showcases what main star talent he really does have. I think Spade is a very good sarcastic comedian and that really develops on what kind of character he chooses to play in a movie. This movie really gives a new setting for Spade. this film Joe Dirt, that he wrote alongside Fred Wolf, is a very hilarious and quite memorable film to keep fresh in your mind for a long time to come. This was really a huge step for Spade, as this was his first starring role and I truly believed he pulled through and showed us how creative he truly can be.",Joe Dirt
27,ginocox-206-336968,Far better than expected,8,5 July 2015,"""Joe Dirt"" offers a lot of laughs, which is the raison d'être of any comedy. And there are many different types of humor: sight gags, 1-2-3 punches, pratfalls, ridicule, absurdities, etc. Some of the humor is broad, raunchy, burlesque and low-brow, but other humor is fairly sophisticated. Some jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, while others are subtle. On a jokes per minute scale, the film ranks among the top. The film has significant and substantial problems. It is difficult to decide which is worse: the title, the cover/poster art, or log lines like ""He came. He cleaned. He conquered,"" or ""Trailer trash wig-wearin' acid wash jean lovin' rock concert T-shirt sportin' hero."" None really describes a movie that I would have expected to find particularly interesting and I made no effort to view the movie until fourteen years after its theatrical release, although I can remember seeing it at video shops and had several opportunities when I was at a loss for something amusing to view. The film is somewhat a parody of ""Forrest Gump,"" which is also a title that says little about the movie's subject matter, unless one is familiar with the book. But the FG producers were somewhat limited by the book's title, whereas the producers of JD could have been more imaginative and incorporated a superlative, an action verb or a recognizable archetype. The promotional artwork relied heavily on an image of a guy holding a mop. People who mop fill a necessary function, but they're usually relegated to after hours when they present less of a nuisance and distraction. In Bangkok, it's impossible to get through a day without encountering about a dozen people sweeping or mopping. Thais sweep and mop everything at all hours of the day and night and still leave their shoes at the entrance. But the reaction is usually to avoid the individual, not take an interest in what or why they are pushing broom. The promo lines fall somewhere between misleading and uninformative. Joe doesn't really conquer. Everybody loves jeans. The wig is a recurring gag that doesn't work or would be much more effective if the hair were natural. It's a bit gross and makes no sense that an adult would wear the same wig worn as a child. JD shines a mirror on the rest of society and holds us up to ridicule for our prejudices, assumptions and tendencies to judge others by superficial standards. These societal prejudices are personified by a radio shock jock played by Dennis Miller who delivers a series of zingers that seem less and less funny as the audience develops sympathy for Joe. Lampooning the audience is a risky form of humor and JD does it adroitly. The viewer is placed in the uncomfortable position of recognizing ones own biases. The movie offers quite a few talented actors in supporting roles that they embrace and play to the hilt. Production values are more than adequate with a refreshing lack of jiggly-cam shots. It's really nice to watch a movie where the filmmakers have enough respect for their audience to plan their shots and use tripods or other support systems for their cameras.",Joe Dirt

Joe Dirt teaches us that ""you can't have no in your heart"" and you just have to keep plugging along even if things are tough, cause ""what else you gonna do, just give up?""

29,Mr_Censored,A True Diamond in the Rough. Dig it!,9,19 January 2010,"While many may look at ""Joe Dirt"" and see a run-of-the-mill, low-class, gross-out comedy from a former ""Saturday Night Live"" star, nothing could be further from the truth. Despite the fact that it didn't fare too well in theaters and critics all but universally panned it, there is more to this white-trash tale than meets the eye.Boasting an impressive classic rock soundtrack and a host of off-key performances and cameos from the likes of Christopher Walken and Kevin Nealon, ""Joe Dirt"" revolves around the titular character, portrayed by David Spade, as he tells his inspiring and often hilarious life-story to a shock-jock (Dennis Miller) and his loyal audience across America. From being abandoned by his parents as a child at the Grand Canyon to finding companionship in a golden retriever and its stunning owner (Brittany Daniel) and getting sexually confused by a floozy whom he mistakes as his sister (Jaime Pressly), Joe's life story plays as fodder for those around him to mock, but in the end, wins everyone over with its inspiring message.Afterall, the key to this movie is its feel-good spirit. What sets this movie aside from so many other comedies in a similar vein is that it is uplifting and touching, while being utterly hilarious at the same time. Because it's a movie that makes you feel good, you'll find yourself watching it again and again, and thankfully, the humor never gets old, as even by your hundredth viewing, you'll still be cracking up at the often broad but simplistic humor. David Spade is playing a likable role for once, and while it went by virtually unnoticed by many critics, his performance is worthy of praise and shows that the comedian has range beyond his usual snarky smart-aleck type-casting. Bottom line: ""Joe Dirt"" is both funny and inspiring, a rare combination. Dig it.",Joe Dirt

34,michaelhirakida,What 'Freddy Got Fingered' Should Have Been,6,9 May 2015,"I must say when I watched Joe Dirt On Crackle, I expected to not like it at all. But to be honest, this movie isn't all that bad. I'm very mixed on Happy Madison's filmography, but I must say this is one of the better films.The movie is about a Loser named Joe Dirt, whose parents put a wig on him at birth because his top part of his brain was showing. The story follows Dirt and he talks about his journey to find his parents, the people he meets and the crazy stuff that happens to him which makes him an overnight star.I noticed something about this film that made me really think back to another film I absolutely despised which I called the worst movie of all time. Freddy Got Fingered. For some reason, I started wondering why I thought about that movie while watching Joe Dirt, but then I realized something. This movie is what Freddy should have been.The problem with Freddy Got Fingered was the whole thing was supposed to be a gross out comedy. Grossing out it succeeds, but there was no substance to it. Joe Dirt has all the substance for a gross out comedy. Joe gets crap dumped on him, the film makes incestuous jokes, has a scene where they have to unfreeze a dog's testicles from a porch, you get the point.Joe Dirt's gross out humor works because of it's character. The character is likable but is sort of lame and has a reason why the gross out stuff happens to him and also, the story even though it's a cut and paste type situation, there is an actual story unlike Freddy where Freddy was just a bunch of sketches. The characters are quite cool. Kicking Wing and Clem being the most interesting played by Adam Beach and Christopher Walken. Walken's Clem is one of his most intriguing roles in the way he acts. Kicking Wing is also a fun character who we first meet as this fireworks store owner out in the middle of nowhere.The movie is quite enjoyable, but it made me yell out in frustration in some parts due to the stupidity of the plot. But that was actually quite fun to do. The Sequel is coming in July on Crackle and I will be definitely tuning in to see the film. Overall, Joe Dirt is an enjoyable gross out comedy film and is worth finding in a bargain bin.68/100 C+",Joe Dirt

Some avid book readers and theater goers, the true lovers of pure ""uncontaminated art and higher truth"" blame cinema of all things (amongst many other marvels of modern life and technology so to say) for being responsible for much of the madness and sin and decadence that goes around us today...How true that might be it is not quite clear. For all that can be said, well, there have always been truly rubbish books, bad operas and false religions and other cruelties and misconceptions around. The entire history of humanity is full of such big mistakes, so, cinema is no exception.Therefore, if there are good movies being made out there occasionally too, then Joe Dirt is one of them.As those who might happen to read a few posts under my name on IMDb may have noticed it so far, I do not write posts on every single movie I do happen to like when I see them once in a while and here or there.

Those who have lost parents in any way, or those who have enjoyed having parents but have been constantly ignored by them. Those who are hurt, those who do hurt, lost morals, twisted truths, abusive relationships of any kind and what not...I hope more people watch movies like this, and more people do think about what is being said in them, and if and when they get the message, I hope they are going to learn from it and make some changes in their ways of living and thoughts if it is so required of them.

Much like other of his movies (Tommy Boy, Dickie Roberts, Benchwarmers, Black Sheep) his performance isn't believable or well done but its usually funny enough to look past. It has some fun cameos and decent supporting cast, and some pretty hilarious lines and scenes. Christopher Walken was hilarious and almost more memorable than David Spade. It stays pretty constant all the way through, it has a bit of a drop off towards the end but other than that.

Nice story, some good gags and a girlfriend pleasing happy ending.Its not brain surgery, but it is well written and acted enough to quite happily pass an hour and a half.Ands thats all I've got to say about that. Well not really because I've got to pass 10 lines........Er.......Oh yeah..... Christopher Walken is, unsurprisingly great. He does a brilliant pastiche of his Weapon of Choice dance. Or is weapon of choice a pastiche of this? I cant be bothered to Google so it looks like this ones staying a mystery.....There we go. 10 lines. That wasn't so hard.....",Joe Dirt
46,nucksfan4life,A guilty pleasure because of David Spade,6,30 August 2003,"I only watched ""Joe Dirt"" to see David Spade, and he pretty much turned out to be the only reason worth watching it. He was pretty funny acting in his mullet. Dennis Miller's appearance in the film was a pleasant surprise. His constant bantering with Spade was fun to watch. I wouldn't recommend the movie to many people, but there it is a guilty pleasure of mine.",Joe Dirt
47,The Gryphon,"Dumb, but Funny",7,12 February 2005,"I kinda liked this movie. It's dumb, but it has some funny moments and a lot of heart. It's David Spade's first crack at playing a nice guy and it works pretty well. Joe Dirt is a guy who got abandoned in the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old and he spends his life trying to find his parents and find out why they left him. It's a low-rent ""Forrest Gump"" type movie that has Dirt traveling the country, meeting odd characters, (including a great cameo by Christopher Walken as a member of the witness protection program,) and getting into and out of a variety of silly situations, such as finding a meteorite that turns out to be something a bit less celestial in origin. Nevertheless, Joe Dirt names the ""meteorite,"" drags it around with him and pledges undying loyalty to it. That gives you a taste of the humor in this movie - silly but sweet with the prerequisite poop and fart jokes for the younger crowd.",Joe Dirt
48,febru3012,This is funny. Many good laughs. Can't wait to see sequel this year........,8,14 June 2015,"This is a cleverly written movie by Spade and an associate. Its funny and well directed. Oh sure as in any comedy there are jokes that miss but its only a few in Joe Dirt and the majority hit. I swore I would have nothing to do with Sandler movies but he's only an Exec Producer which means he invested some cash into the making of the movie and thankfully didn't write, direct or even appear. Thats the best I can say about this picture and what makes it worth an 8 and worth seeing. On the whole its funny and doesn't demand anything from its audience. BTW Brittany Daniel is another reason to see this movie for the guys, she is SUPER HOT!",Joe Dirt
49,ljwickert,David Spade isn't the best as the 'headliner',3,4 August 2001,"Like most movies that have former SNL cast members, you have to like the comedian to like the movie.  Spade is a redneck, left in the Grand Canyon by his parents, and he spends the rest of his life trying to find them.  Not that good, but keep your eye on Brittany Daniel in the future..a natural beauty, at least I believe she's all-natural.you never can tell these days! D",Joe Dirt
50,FunnyMann,Below average,5,13 October 2001,"""Joe Dirt"" is a subpar entry in the idiot-loser-makes-good genre of movies made by Sandler, Schneider, at al. Now, idiot-loser-makes-good can be very funny when it's done well. But here, it ain't. The big problem is that David Spade has miscast himself. I don't know how, as co-writer of this film, he failed to see how wrong he is for the title role. His main strength as a comic is caustic condescension, but he's on the wrong end of it here. Spade is at his funniest when he is picking on pathetic losers, not portraying one.The best joke in this film is a ""Silence of the Lambs"" takeoff. The bit caught me completely off guard and made me laugh very hard because Joe Dirt, shall we say, doesn't quite grasp the magnitude of his predicament. And because the joke surprised me, I temporarily forgot that Spade is too smart to be that stupid. The rest of the time, I didn't forget, and that's what dragged down the movie.Oh well. At least it's harmless.",Joe Dirt
51,EasternMafia,This is funny movie!,10,2 December 2006,"Thanks to producer that he have found this script. This movie is funniest than 90 percent others you can see out there. I have pi.. my self watching it. This movie I can watch two times. No doubt about it. Faces, actors are all great. No fakes at all. They don't need to use some strange mouth moves to be funny - as others do in the comedy movies.I like the quotes: White trash. ""Home is where you make it - You like to see homos naked?""I would to give an example similar to this movie, but there is not. Ten points defiantly for this movie.",Joe Dirt
52,timelord-3,Surprisingly enjoyable,6,21 May 2001,"I braced myself for yet another film with low grade humour, plenty of bodily function jokes and not enough plot to go around.Well, 'Joe Dirt' has all that and more... but surprisingly it turned out to be not half bad.Perhaps the day of the preview caught me in a particularly good mood, because this story of a white trash loser searching for his parents who left him for dead at the Grand Canyon when he was eight was relatively enjoyable entertainment.The movie is told primarily in flashback; Joe stumbles into the studio of a radio disc jockey who coaxes out of him his incredible life story.  In the process Joe Dirt becomes a media darling as his story of woe and misfortune is heard by an ever sympathetic audience.This is another movie which relies on the gross and disgusting to get its laughs; dogs balls stuck to the front porch, being covered in excrement, blowing up atom bombs, consumed by alligators and much much more!The movie works for the most part because of David Spade's affable loser Joe Dirt.  He plays a character that is not a 100 miles away from his 'Just Shoot Me' personna - a loveable idiot.  He goes through life having all these setbacks - but he still maintains his positive outlook.The movie does lag a bit at the three quarters mark, but this is a minor quibble for a film that does what is sets out to with a lot more style than its lamentable cousins.A whole lotta fun6 out of 10.",Joe Dirt
53,Pigalina,Once is enough,4,20 July 2005,"I had to watch this for the second time the other day, once is all you need. It's an OK film , it raised a few smiles with me and at one point I do believe I chuckled aloud. However, that was all. Joe Dirt is played by David Spade and is a rock loving country boy who was abandoned by his parents when he was eight. He has a huge mullet which is a wig that is fused to his head. He cleans at a radio station and they get him on air to tell his story and he becomes a huge celebrity. The DJ interviewing him is ridiculously rude, he wouldn't last long without a smack in the face in the real world. Joe's story is a big road trip where he goes to find his lost parents. There is of course a love interest and a happy ending. This is 100% a throwaway movie, watch it once then discard.",Joe Dirt
54,donlhumphries,A funny film,7,21 June 2001,"I've just seen ""Joe Dirt"" starring David Spade, and quite enjoyed it. Don't think it will win any Academy Award, but still is a good movie in its own right.  Some old friends are evident - Christopher Walken from ""Sleepy Hollow"", Fred Ward from ""Tremors"", and Rosanna Arquette from ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" (see her fingernails/talons in Joe Dirt!).  Joe Dirt has a moral to it, which is not too apparent; it is also somewhat of a detective story.  Altogether, a funny film.",Joe Dirt
55,isotope2112,Please... make it stop!,1,6 June 2002,"I would rather be defiled by a syphilitic chimpanzee than be forced to watch this movie again.  I thought David Spade in a mullet wig could carry this movie.  I was wrong.  Nothing could make up for the lack of funny jokes and terrible acting by everyone in this film.  This is why all SNL alumni (except Sandler, Akroyd, and Murray) should be disallowed from making movies.",Joe Dirt
56,adamp-6,The biggest shock? I actually laughed.,5,23 January 2002,"So, I saw the publicity for ""Joe Dirt"", and I thought to myself ""whew, that looks like a stinker"".  But I had several friends go see it and tell me it was funny, so I checked it out, and I was surprised.Yes, it's stupid.  No, there's not really much of a plot.  But some of the gags work, especially if you (like me) live in Oklahoma or some other part of the Midwest and are used to seeing people like Joe.  When he rattles off all those firecracker names -- that's just movie magic, folks.I wish they would've gotten someone other than Dennis Miller for the 'shock jock', though.  His painful mugging for the camera and line delivery that almost comes with an elbow to the ribs was just too much for me.  Oh well.But other than that, there were some great redneck nuances that made this here landlocked fella appreciate the film.",Joe Dirt
57,sludgehound,Funny I liked it,10,25 November 2003,"Much faster delivery of laughs than many prior comments might leave you to believe. If fan of early Steve Martin, well it's in that vein. Wacky but underlining serious wit about a spoiled media society. Talk about your ultimate underdog.....Joe Dirte (he added the e) gets just the right broad brushed look at the rejected & unwanted. The radio interview format alone is enough satire. Just kept rolling along, fast. I'll never fear the A Bomb again -- best trip on that sinceHow I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.",Joe Dirt
58,Bondo20,Much better than anyone could expect.,7,23 October 2001,"The only reason I made the choice to watch this movie was thatI'm a fan of Dennis Miller.  What I got was not only one of hisfunnier apperances in a movie (not that that says much as hismovies haven't exactly been stelar), but an overall funny movie. Miller is a host of a radio show (with the sophisticated wit that hasbecome his trademark) who as a joke has Joe Dirt (David Spade),the resident janitor on as an interview subject.  Joe goes on to tella riviting, well at least interesting story of his life.  Here is where Iwould expect the movie to go straight down the drain but the storyis put together well to provide funny, gross, and shallowly dramaticparts to entertain like a normal movie but with none of theseriousness.  Sure if you would rate this movie directly againstothers it might fail, but strictly as a comedy it proves to be betterthan average which is much better than I expected.",Joe Dirt
59,savagesteve13,Take it for what it is - a Comedy!,6,7 August 2008,"You would think that such a simplistic premise would make for a crappy movie but it was hilarious. Lets face it, dumb rednecks are funny. There were some great supporting actors like Christopher Walken who as usual steals the show when he's on, and the Silence of the Lambs thing was absolutely golden, with Brian Thompson doing a great parody even though he only had a few minutes of screen time. The cameos are many, and the humor is wicked and pulls no punches. Some of it is outright dumb at first but is explained later on, such as the nuke which seemed so cheesy with 50's file footage....but it explains why near the end of the movie. Overall its good mindless entertainment, and Spade does a surprisingly good redneck. I think it helps that he's a skinny. I'm no big fan of Dennis Miller but as a supporting character he makes sense here, and mercifully he's more the straight guy than the unfunny guy trying to be funny (his normal role). Kid Rock is so redneck he reminds me of the locals around here.",Joe Dirt
60,dbrookfield,better than expected,4,26 March 2002,"Saw this when it came out on cable.  Seems like it had been embarrassingly brief at the box office and panned by critics, so my expectation was that I would probably find it too lame to watch, but instead I was pleasantly surprised.  A bit of good silly fun, some sentiment here and there.  For me, light years better than the equally critically panned Resident Evil.",Joe Dirt

The whole idea of the radio show was a neat platform for this movie, it kept things on two levels, and this really added to the story/progression of the movie. There is quite a few funny moments, mostly from Spade, but the odd Kid Rock line is laughable as well. Again cool story platform, and lets face it Jaime Pressley is the perfect eye candy....WOWSERSThis is a good little semi-classic in the stoner/comfort genre.

62,morrowman2,One of the worst films out there,2,16 September 2006,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 2001 and it was by far one of the worst films I think I've ever seen. David Spade can be funny at times but in this film he worsen't funny at all. The script was lousy, the actors were awful and the story was terrible. This was a complete waste of film, time and money not to mention that the movie was not even funny or amusing and David Spade could have done a heck of a lot better cause some of his films are actually good but not this one it was horrible and boring and a complete waste, So my advice is If you haven't seen this film yet then don't bother because it's not worth seeing at all.",Joe Dirt

I like the dumb comedy like everybody else.  This movie past my threshold for pain.

The story is a guy named joe dirt has gone on ambitious quest to find his long lost parents however, crazy misadventures happen along the way. The main character is just impossible to hate with his optimistic attitude and ability to make friends with everyone (including those he really should have stayed away from haha). Hes in some ways comparable to forrest gump, but with more cunning ways of getting put of his missteps along the way. Probably one of david spades best movies be ever made. Not exactly a movie to show to younger children, but if theyre teen and up a definite recommed watch you'll never forget.",Joe Dirt
66,firedude440,Funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!,7,30 July 2001,This is much better than I thought it would be. It still is corny like you thought it would be. There is even camio appearances by Christopher Walken and Dennis Miller. To me it was so funny it felt like it was half an hour.

67,barbadosdagny,A Classic Comedy For Sure!,10,19 July 2008,"A classic comedy you can watch over and over with frequent chuckles with every viewing. On my second viewing, ""Joe Dirt"" qualified. (My Numero Uno classic comedy is still ""Animal House"".)Yes, I know, Adam Sandler co-executive-produced it. The only movie he was involved in I liked was ""50 First Dates"". Most of the others were crude and gross-filled with fart and poop jokes for their own sake that appeal only to those under 12. Full disclosure: I am more than 5 x age 12! But they seemed appropriate to this unlikely hero's story who despite one adversity after another, remained positive and prevailed. For those of you who rated it only 5 or 6, what would have made it a 9 or 10 for you? I usually see a movie and say, ""if only they had done so and so, or ""great actors, lousy script"" (or vice versa). But I thought it was a perfect gem and couldn't think of a thing to improve it except the soundtrack (a 7 which could easily have been a 10.) The script, co-written by the under-appreciated David Spade as the adult ""Joe Dirt"", the acting and directing (the hardest part of creating a true comedy) were all spot on excellent. The top notch casting included many of our favorite actors in small, but perfect roles, including Patricia Arquette (where have you been?), Dennis Miller, Kid Rock (ouch, yummo!), and Christopher Walken. A shout out to the make up department (and acting) for aging the principle players over the 17 years the story unfolded. Per as the young Joe Dirt was perfect.I was shocked at the average rating of 5.3! I gave it a 10 instead of a 9 to bring the average up a fraction. See it again, re-vote, and tell your friends who love uplifting stories about overcoming great odds with humor and a positive outlook not to miss it!",Joe Dirt
68,joethecoolioest,Well.....................,8,6 February 2008,"OK this movie was produced by Adam Sandler so it has to be good!!Well this is pretty funny but not excellent!!!David Spade was really funny in this movie and he had a lot of funny jokes.Also it has Christopher Walken and David Spade in it so it was really funny!!!!!The only thing is that well I ca't put my finger on it but it just wasn't one of my favorites.I think it was just because i was used to Jim Carrey,Adam Sandler, and Chevy Chase's kind of humor.I find David Spade to be funny but he just isn't like them.But this was a good movie and you should go out and at least rent it.You will get some pretty good laughs.Also the poop on the head part was HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!So go out and rent this!",Joe Dirt
69,mlescully,Kinda dumb fun,7,4 April 2002,"Just thinking about this movie made my IQ drop several points, so I avoided it until it came out on cable.  So, it was on, and I decided to watch it. Sure, it was dumb, but it was truly amusing.  I had forgotten that Adam Beach was in it, and it was such fun to see him in something else(though it was more than a bit embarrassing, the guy can really act), and I wished that he had more to do.  I'll give it a seven, at least because the director had the good sense to put him in it.",Joe Dirt
70,criggar,Film falls flat.,5,21 May 2001,"First of all, let me clarify that this film does not do a good job of developing a plot.  Most of the actions which are critical to the plot are those involving Joe's search for his parents.  The fact that Joe does not understand where his home is seems trite to me, and lets face it, if I were shacked up within a hundred miles of Brittney Daniel, I would probably know where my home is at.  Another thing is the Dennis Miller comments. Although I can agree with that Dennis Miller can be funny from time to time, his portrayal of the jackass radio host is a far cry from Howard Stern (whom he immitates very poorly.)  The way that the director sets his character up, the viewer actually begins to hate Dennis Miller.  I saw the movie at the theater, and at times there were yawns and growls coming from the other viewers simply because we had to hear more Dennis Miller.  The lamest part of the plot occurs when Joe finally finds what he is looking for, and spends about two minutes resolving what takes an hour and a half to build up.  The one thing which saves this movie is not Dennis Miller, nor is it the pretty Brittney Daniel, who is in the film for about a total of ten minutes, it is Christopher Walken.  Christopher Walken's character ""Clem"" is absolutely hilarious.  So basically I paid 8 dollars to see three minutes of Christopher Walken saying hilarious things.  I'm sorry to say this, but the movie would have been better off as an SNL skit.  I'm also sorry to David Spade who is normally an above average actor.  If you want to see good David Spade, go to the video store and rent ""Lost and Found""  I feel this film falls flat for one reason, David Spade is not playing the role of the sarcasim machine, but rather Dennis Miller is, and this does not gel because David Spade does sarcasm with the best of the best.  Don't go into this movie expecting to see the usual ""Just Shoot Me"" David Spade, or the ""Tommy Boy"" David Spade, because in this movie, David spade acts more like a shier version of Damon Wayans chracter ""Blankman.""  Not worth a dime without Christopher Walken, with Walken, worth a dollar fifty matinee!",Joe Dirt
71,nymichael2002,pure torture,1,11 February 2005,"Just when I thought I saw the worst movie ever made, Freddy Got Fingered, this piece of garbage comes out. Mind you I find David Space to be a fine comic actor. I liked him in ""Tommy Boy"", ""Dickie Roberts"" and on ""Saturday Night Live"". He's also always a great guest on the Howard Stern show but this movie was so bad I don't even know where to begin. The mullet jokes wear thin after the first five minutes and the slapstick humor is really lame. Poorly written and directed there is absolutely nothing funny about this film. The fact that this movie also stars Dennis Miller and Kid Rock goes to show how desperate they must have been to agree to make a film this poor.",Joe Dirt

David Spade as Joe tells his story of looking for his parents since they left him at the Grand Canyon when he was just 8 years old. He tells an L.A. based radio audience, over 3 days, of his adventures over the years; about the places he's been and the people he met. No matter what bad hand fortune dealt Joe Dirt, he always kept a positive out look on life, while still searching for mom and dad.

They are not meant to be taken seriously, nor literally. It's a comedy about Joe Dirt. The fact that it pokes fun at the whole ""white trash"" stereotype is what makes it funny. I mean that is what it is supposed to do. Come on even Kid Rock was in there, he may fit the ""white trash"" stereotype, but I don't think anyone would complain about his lifestyle. I thought this movie was hilarious, and even under the comedy is a bit of good IL' family/life values. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over and still get a kick out of it.

Yet, there was a depth to the movie that kept you intrigued, gripped.I watched this movie solely to see Christopher Walken's cameo and tag line threat. But by accident, gained an appreciation for David Spade who I have never paid much attention to in past.So once you come to grips with fact that this show is primarily a goofy comedy, and like many goofy comedies, plot weaknesses abound (why would one even expect a solid plot... duh). It is a succession of brilliantly executed comedic dialogues and settings. The naivety of the fireworks vendor's endeavors being a great example.And the fact that a number of more notable actors of the time would participate in the film (Christopher Walken, Rosanna Arquette, Dennis Miller), tells me that there was something more to it than just a silly slapstick comedy. They must have felt something bigger was being created. I feel it was. A bit of a classic that not only has clever antics, but a positive, uplifting message.I would recommend it.",Joe Dirt

Next year will be the 20th anniversary of Joe Dirt. I am only writing this because it is on Comedy Channel now. I've seen these movies 5 or 6 times. Still good for an easy laugh after a long day!
Anyway, you don't have to be a fan of Spade to enjoy this movie! One reviewer called this an ""SNL Ripoff"". True, it was breakout role for yet another SNL alumni. (Damn, they have put out so many future comedy movie actors)!!
This movie has a lot of other pluses, a great supporting cast. Highlights are Christopher ""I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron"" Walken, and Kid ""I'm E-Litrit"" Rock! Brittany Daniel is the sexiest, most lovable country girl anyone could ever want!
It's and evening of cheap, easy laughs, and you even care about and like Joe in the end! It seems to have still remained funny to me after all these year. But watch it again, and get someone new to watch it with you, and eat a bunch of pot brownies before you watch, just like I did!",Joe Dirt

83,Topsider,Worst Movie I've ever seen,1,16 April 2001,"ATTENTION!  I want everyone reading this to know that it's over.  You've killed it.  It's not funny anymore. I am of course talking about `mullet humor', and it must be stopped. A while back, mullets were kind of an in-joke, a kitschy piece of odd humor that only some people understood.  Today, It's gotten so out of control that people think any odd haircut classifies as some type of  `mullet cut', and that the word itself is inherently funny.  The relentless overkill of this novelty has sucked the very last fleck of humor and camp-fun out the `mullet humor' genre.   Gee, this reminds me of another genre that is bereft of life:  one-dimensional character driven comedies starring `Saturday Night Live' has-been's and never-will-be's that plague the theaters. The new disaster `Joe Dirt', pathetically combines these two dying trends.  When will they stop?  I mean, on the poster for `Joe Dirt', it says, `FROM THE PRODUCERS OF 'DEUCE BIGALOW:  MALE GIGOLO', like it's some kind of selling point.  In the back of my mind, I hoped people would learn from such flops as `Little Nicky' and `The Ladies Man'. But somehow David Spade and executive producer Adam Sandler manage to squeeze out this piece of crud.  It's the kind of movie you scrape off the bottom of your shoe, only to have the cat eat it and regurgitate it back up later on the living room floor.  But I'm being to nice. With no plot to speak of, let's just say that the whole movie is based around the fact that they'll hope you'll think Spade's mullet is funny for an hour and a half.  (movie spoiler:  It's not!) Just when I thought I couldn't hate this movie anymore, Kid Rock shows up.  And only God know why.  Playing an illiterate redneck must have been a stretch for Mr. Rock. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Chris Farley's brother makes an eerie appearance alongside Spade, which to me was more tasteless than the repeated fart jokes. But the most disturbing fact of all, is that people around me in the theater laughed at this movie.  Note to David Spade:    I liked this movie the first time.....whhhenn it was called....wait a minute.  I never liked this movie the first time.",Joe Dirt
84,bjaardker,Was VERY surprised by this one!,7,24 April 2001,"I went to this movie with a friend just to kill some time after work. I wasn't expecting ANYTHING from it, Especially after the very cliche' trailers they ran for it.It only took about 5-10 minutes for me to actually start enjoying the flick. And then when I saw that Dennis Miller was in I was fired up (I'm a big D.miller fan).In the end, my friend and I looked at each other and agreed, that was the stupidest movie we've seen in a long time however we both walked out with smiles on our faces.If I had to sum up my feelings on this movie to one word. It would be Endearing.",Joe Dirt
85,tar_palantir1,A decent comedy with some heart.,9,19 September 2006,"I wouldn't put this movie on a par with other over-the-top comedies like Zoolander (one of my favorites) but Joe Dirt has more than just a few low-brow laughs to offer. The main character is the very likable, albeit pathetic, Joe Dirt. The movie isn't just about the random cross-country meanderings of a clueless white trash janitor - as the promos would lead you to believe. Joe has a good heart and an upbeat attitude that have helped him through times that would have crushed most people. He's searching for his family (from whom he was separated during a trip to the Grand Canyon at age 8) and does some pretty good detective work to find them, while along the way inspiring some other ""lowlifes"" to do better by themselves. The story is told in the format of a radio interview that catapaults Joe into the hearts of the audience members. This movie can actually help you suspend disbelief temporarily and believe in the kindness of strangers without being overly saccharine and sappy (we can thank some of the raunchy humor for that).",Joe Dirt
86,jenrey345,"Good music, hurtful movie.",2,16 April 2001,"Good music, a real plus for someone who grew up in the 70's.But I found the film to be full of hurtful incidents that were funny only if one was cruel. It did get less bad towards the end. I'm sorry I wasted my money.",Joe Dirt
87,mctwist,Pretty Dang Funny!,8,11 April 2001,"I seriously thought this movie was going to be a bomb.  But I could not stop laughing through the entire film.  It was just plain awesome.  People will be quoting this film for awhile, so bring a pen and paper to write some good ones down.  Christopher Walken also made the film AWESOME, with his mobster like comments.  Chris Rock on the other hand, kinda sucked.  I really didnt like him in the film much, maybe it was because of his character. Anyways, its worth seeing, so go out and see it!",Joe Dirt
88,WisdomSeed,A Nice Surprise,7,20 January 2007,"I am not sure what was expected from this movie or why the people who did not like it did not like it, but it was a nice surprise of a movie for me. Occasionally some people get together and make an unexpectedly good movie and this was one of those time. With a good amount of humor and cuteness about it, and a surprisingly sympathetic performance from the normally acerbic David Spade it was a pretty nice waste of time, like Fifty First Dates was. There was some guttural humor (an atomic *stink*bomb), it was a well layered joke when you think about it, but it was (thankfully) no Farelley brothers piece of... well you know. It does not ask a lot of you and keeps you entertained. Joe Dirt is the lovable loser, on a mission to find out that home is where you make it (or to love homeboys naked).",Joe Dirt

Kind of like Dana Carvey when he did Opportunity Knocks and/or Clean Slate.Great music throughout the film and loved his nod to the great Eddie Money.Murphy is certainly an attractive women and I am surprised we have not seen more of her.The mullet is kind of a one joke pony that is ridden too hard, but still funny.An ok comedy, but don't expect to have to change your underwear after this one.",Joe Dirt

Its Basically a White Trash version of Forrest Gump. It has lots of big named actors, who don't just appear as cameo's, but help in holding the story together.Its never going to win any Oscars or ever be considered anything more then a Beer and Pizza movie with your buddies. But if your willing to accept that fact then you will enjoy it.Not to mention quoting it at every opportunity. Great fun for all the family.""Life's a garden, Dig it""",Joe Dirt

The movie has subtle satire as well as in your face jokes. Each time you rewatch you find more and more to enjoy in the hidden things in the film. The plot of this film also goes very unappreciated because of the slapstick humor. Just go in to this movie to laugh not to read into every little detail and analyze it to the extreme.",Joe Dirt
93,DumbBastard,Why can't David Spade be funny in movies?,2,14 September 2001,"A few weeks before I saw Joe Dirt, I watched David Spade's HBO comedy special and I pretty much laughed non-stop for the entire hour. It was absolutely hilarious. I rented Joe Dirt expecting more of the same, but instead I got to see a movie full of lowbrow humor (done badly), tired jokes, and horrible horrible acting. If David Spade is so funny as a stand-up comedian, why can't he be in a funny movie?. It would have been better to just see him do stand-up for an hour and a half rather than see him fall down, get hit with things, and make overdone jokes about white trash like he did this whole movie.",Joe Dirt

I guess I could see why teeny boppers, those of you who hate the southern style, or southerners who can't laugh at themselves would find this movie hard to bare. I personally know or have interacted with quite a few people who remind me of Joe (Good hearted white trash) so this movie made me laugh my butt off! To all of you who didn't like this flick I say,loosen up people you should get out more. It must be hard to go through life with a since of humor the size of a black eyed pea. No one should think there self too good to laugh at Joe Dirt. I give it a solid **** out of *****",Joe Dirt
95,sidemoss,Trailer does not do it justice,7,18 June 2001,"This had the worst trailer imaginable.  This movie was so much better than it was made out to be.  The marketing people who set this one up were total idiots.David Spade is great.  He totally carries the movie.  His subtle comments throughout show that he is much better than just a white trash hero.  You like him so much.  The trailer makes him look like he is a lame, dumpy guy with a chip on his shoulder.  The movie is not like that at all.  I actually wanted to get a mullet like his after seeing this.Dennis Miller is fun along with Fred Ward and Christopher Walken.  It is great to see Joe Dirte tell the story in kind of a Forrest Gump fashion only instead of hating him, you like him because he actually has a soul.",Joe Dirt
96,giggsmiller,An absolute cracker,7,18 May 2006,"I'm giving this film 7 out of 10 on the fact that it has made me laugh and laugh again. I have films like the Godfather, Scarface, Shawshank Redemption and others in my DVD collection but I can tell you I have watched this film more than any of those. As others have said this film does what it sets out to do, make you laugh, and that it does and then some.Its stupidity is great and the abuse that Joe (David Spade) receives is just fantastic. If you like watching a lovable loser get abused then this is the movie for you. Lots of laughs and memorable sayings, its a classic, 'Life a garden, dig it' and 'you can't have no in your heart' all coming from a white trash loser with a mullet who announces on the radio that he was 'jerkin his gherkin'makes for a laughfest. Highly recommended but don't expect to use your brain, juvenile amusement all the way. And Brittany Daniels as Joe love interest 'Brandy' is incredibly hot.",Joe Dirt
97,manzarek75,Watch this more than once!,9,20 March 2005,"After watching this movie the first time, I was pleasantly surprised and thought the story was interesting and kept you hoping that things would work out for Joe Dirt. Had some really great one liners from Joe Dirt, some of the stuff he does is just so trailer trash! I gave it a 7 out of 10 on first viewing - great but not a classic.After watching this a second and third time, I really think this comedy classic with James Spade is a shockingly neglected and under rated comedy. Not only is this film hilarious at times, but the way the story is told via the DJ who is always making fun of him, is simply great. You just feel even more sorry for him when you watch it again. And Christopher Walken is so great! He really should be in more comedy - the parts when he is talking to himself in the mirror, acting out his old mafia days, are true classic movie moments! And So what if the acting isn't Oscar material? This film wasn't expecting to win any Oscars for acting! And so what if the humor is toilet humour sometimes - sometimes this kind of humour can be the funniest - take a look at English comedy classics like monthly python, fawlty towers and the like - these all use a lot of childish or toilet humour, but they are still classics! Stop bashing this film - sit down with no expectations and watch it (again). If you don't laugh more than 10 times in this film, I'm sorry but you need to get out more. Some people just hate films so much that they refuse to laugh even when they know its funny, just so they can say they didn't laugh once - i think this is the case with many people and this film, especially some of the other people that have commented badly on this film! Go rent it now!",Joe Dirt
98,bandunk,"This movie is not funny, don't see this.",1,26 May 2001,"As we made our way to the drive in I wondered how I was going to take the movie ""Joe Dirt"". Well, as respectable as I could be I sat and quietly watched the whole movie. At the end of it not only was I angry that I had wasted my money but I was also mad that I had sat there quietly, because I didn't laugh once!     This Jay Leno/Adam Sandler type humor film stars David Spade as a guy with a mullet trying to find his parents. The story is cheesy and the mix of nostalgic and sappy music helps drill that into your head. None of this really matters though because you know the makers of this film would say ""Oh, we were just trying to make a funny movie, not win an oscar."" The only problem is the movie isn't funny... at all. The jokes can be seen a mile away and the delivery of them are unoriginal and haphazardly done.
     The thing that bothered me the most though was how my enemy was in this film. The decadent, no talent Kid Rock plays himself; a redneck idiot that picks on people and has ten words in his vocabulary. His character is also not funny and very irritating to watch.     I used to like Adam Sandler movies(Yeah I know its terrible.), but he is becoming increasingly predictable and less funny as he gets older. ""Joe Dirt"" is dirt, and the next movie coming out of this studio ""The Animal"" I'm sure will be even worse. ""Joe Dirt"" is a midget short of a Kid Rock video and a million jokes short of being viewable. I give this movie a 1 out of 10. Don't see this!",Joe Dirt
99,mohimwong,"Although not shakespeare, here's the dirt on this warm hearted romp.",7,15 April 2001,"Joe Dirt has been slammed relentlessly by the critics as unfunny and stupid. I went to see the film last night, and let me just say I found myself still smiling about it when I got home. Although it wasn't at the same level of comedy as Little Nicky and Deuce Bigelow, Joe Dirt was a movie with some very funny moment. It played over all as more of a feel good comic drama. It had some very stupid moments, but there are also many welcome Dennis Miller scenes and hilarious cameos. Although Joe Dirt is an idiot he is not a Kid Rock. You definitely feel for him and his story, and that's what really makes this movie. I guarantee that if you can sit through some really bad moments in the beginning then you'll come out of the theatre feeling good and having a new desire to grow a mullet cut.",Joe Dirt

103,darkjezter,Forrest Gump meets Jeff Foxworthy.,7,10 May 2006,"Despite the fact that this movie was trashed by critics, Joe Dirt still makes me laugh every time I watch it. If you've seen other movies made by Adam Sandler, then you should know what to expect: lots of low-brow humor and implausible situations. This movie definitely isn't for film snobs, but if you're just looking for a cheap laugh, Joe Dirt is definitely worth a rental.This movie tells the life story of a man named Joe Dirt (played by David Spade), the mullet-wearing, hard rock-loving embodiment of every white trash stereotype in existence. This is a very different type of character for David Spade, who usually plays sarcastic and bitter male secretary types as opposed to the likable moron he plays in this.As the movie begins, Joe Dirt is working as a janitor at a radio station when he is noticed by a Howard Stern-like DJ played by Dennis Miller. The DJ calls Joe Dirt into the studio and starts asking questions, intending to use the trashy janitor as a target for ridicule. It is here where we begin to learn the back story of Joe Dirt, beginning when he was a little kid abandoned by his parents during a trip to the Grand Canyon.After the initial radio interview, the story of Joe Dirt becomes a national pop culture phenomenon. Our hero is invited back into the studio to continue his story, which consists of his various adventures as he travels around the country looking for his long-lost family. During his travels he befriends the beautiful and kind-hearted Brandy (Brittany Daniel), is bullied by a arrogant jerk named Robbie (Kid Rock), teams up with an American Indian fireworks dealer named Kicking Wing (Adam Beach), and crosses paths with a school janitor with a shady past (Christopher Walken). You also discover that, despite the fact that Joe Dirt is a crude and ignorant individual, you can't help but find yourself rooting for him and admiring his ability to keep a positive attitude despite all the bad things that keep happening to him.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. It's funny, even uplifting, and worth seeing at least once if you aren't offended by toilet humor.",Joe Dirt
104,Toakie,Not as poor as expected,6,27 July 2002,"I expected Joe Dirt to be just as lousy as most of the rest SNL alumni offerings. Certainly, it's not great cinematic achievement but for mindless, juvenile humor it's not so bad. Christopher Walken parodies himself rather well, Dennis Miller is solid, and Kid Rock is so suitable for his redneck role. Brittany Daniel is not so convincing in her role as Spade's love interest but she looks amazing. If you've got an hour and a half to kill, catch it HBO or something.",Joe Dirt
105,glory_us,"Surprisingly, Joe Dirt isn't all that bad!",7,14 April 2001,"When I walked into The adventures of Joe Dirt with my friends, it was trough peer pressure. I did not expect much more than immature jokes here and there, with not much story.But hold on Joey! While it did have its share of lame jokes, there actually was a story in this one. It had some drama in it, and you found yourself laughing, but also a tad saddened by his story. You found yourself cheering for Joe Dirt. Of course, some of the more emotional moments got ruined by adding a silly joke at the climax, but that's a typical guy reaction (like me), which is kind of weird. Making a joke in a emotional scene, just to show I'm not getting emotional.So this movie is definitely watchable, and enjoyable.",Joe Dirt
106,deraz-2,Forrest Gump for the gross-out generation,8,27 April 2001,"This is definitely one of the most underrated films I have seen. It has a great story and the gross-out humor is not overdone like it is in some other recent comedies. Like Forest Gump, Joe Dirt is a social reject because he is different, but he has managed to live through a painful and interesting life while still maintaining his optimism. Overall, this is a funny feel-good movie that is somewhere between ""Forrest Gump"" and ""There's Something About Mary"".",Joe Dirt

I had saw the trailer quite a few times and it looked like another great David Spade movie.  But when I did go see it I was a little disappointed.  Spade plays a dirt poor, mullet wearing, piece of pure American white trash that becomes the movies hero.  The storyline was actually really good, and it was hard not to root for Joe Dirt.  The thing that made me mad was Spade had to play a slow witted character, and the genius of his comedy is his great comebacks.  Without those witty comebacks the movie just seemed to go on endlessly.  The Adventures of Joe Dirt was hysterical and full of great gags, but the trailer was definitely more hype then the movie was capable of fulfilling.  The only high point of the movie for me was the 10 minute scene of Jaime Pressly as Jill.  Besides getting back together with Brandy, nailing Jill had to be the highlight of Joe Dirt's meager existence.  Who knows it might make a good rental!",Joe Dirt

Apart from the slow start, the movie picks up half an hour into it, with some very funny moments and the surprise appearance of some well known stars, such as Rosanna Arquette and Chirstopher Walken.

I can't honestly see someone not laughing at Christopher Walken's role, or the Fireworks stand scene. The Buffalo Bill spoofs and cracks made it just flat silly at times, and that... that my friends, is adolescent humor. If you don't like childish humor, well this movie isn't for you.

But unlike Joe Dirt, who mistakes the crap for a meteorite and only later discovers what it truly is, the viewer knows that this movie is nothing more than a pile of crap from the beginning. But what should one expect from the director of an Olsen Twins movie? Did people actually encourage David Spade into believing this character is even remotely amusing? David Spade should have been killed and buried along with Chris Farley, just like in Ancient Egypt the servants would be entombed along with the Pharoah, because its painfully clear that Spade's career died along with Farley that day.

It isn't fair to rate this movie a 2-4 because you rate those kinds of movies an 8-10. Movies should be rated in comparison with other movies in the same genre, and Joe Dirt is far and away, one of the best movies in its genre. If you don't like slapstick comedy type films, this isn't for you. However, the story line of Joe Dirt is far better than most slapstick comedy films.I'm not going to describe the story at all, as the other 184 people who commented already did that. What I will tell you, is that before I saw this movie, I disliked David Spade. I didn't find most of his smug, pretentious characters funny. Joe Dirt Single-handedly made me love David Spade. The story is great, the comedy is great, the scenery is great, the soundtrack is great; there really isn't anything to dislike about this film, and it's one of my favorites. 9/10 in its genre.""It puts the Joe Dirt in the hole""",Joe Dirt

Joe Dirt is a great character and in my opinion is one of the greatest heroes of cinema, because everyone loves Joe Dirt even if the critics didn't. He still found a way into America's heart. So I call ""Joe Dirt"" one of the funniest, dumbest, heartwarming films in years. Definitely better than the ""Superbad"" that's for sure.

116,bonjovifan2000,The White Trash Equivalent of Forrest Gump,10,22 January 2011,"Simply put, Joe Dirt is the white trash equivalent of Forrest Gump. Joe Dirt is not a sophisticated, Oscar worthy film like Forrest Gump, but it is still an entertaining film. The plot draws you into the story. Joe Dirt (David Spade) is a gentle, kind hearted white trash man who has had a tough life. His parents abandoned him during a vacation to the Grand Canyon when he was only eight years old. Joe has spent his life trying to find his parents and his home. One day while working as a janitor at a Los Angeles radio station, Joe finds himself retelling his painful life story to the sarcastic and sleazy DJ Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller). Zander Kelly and his audience quickly become fascinated by Joe's life story. Joe becomes a media sensation. Joe Dirt, like Forrest Gump, is an unlikely hero. Despite all the obstacles Joe has faced in his life, he remains positive and refuses to let go of the hope of finding his long lost family. Basically the story comes down to this: goods things happen to good people, or as Joe puts it ""you can't have no in your heart!""David Spade wrote the film with his long time friend Fred Wolf (who did some stuff for SNL, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep). Spade and Wolf were clearly meticulous in their writing. There aren't any significant continuity or plot errors. Each scene builds upon the last and builds up for the next scene. There is a lot of low-grade humor in the film, but there's also lots of physical/slapstick humor--remember this is a film starring, produced and written by SNL alumni.There is something about the plot that gets you involved in the story. This is the type of film you can put in your DVD player and lose yourself in the story for an hour and a half or however long the movie lasts. Joe Dirt is a lovable character, it's easy to empathize with him. I think this is a testament to the way Spade and Wolf wrote the script and the way Spade portrays the Joe Dirt character. Either way, Spade and Wolf did an excellent job writing this script. Spade plays a different character for this movie. If you're looking for the sarcastic, acerbic Spade character, you won't find it in this film. This time, he plays the nice lovable guy. Dennis Miller has the more stereotypical Spade character. Spade said he wrote Miller's character and based it upon what he would say if Joe Dirt was sitting in front of him. Kid Rock also appears in the film, he was good and funny! Joe Dirt didn't get rave reviews from big name film critics (this was an Adam Sandler/Happy Madison production and we all know Sandler flicks don't go over too well with the critics). I think was a rather underrated comedy. Joe Dirt is definitely worth watching! The reason why I gave this film such a high rating was partially because of the writing, portrayal of the characters, and simply because I like David Spade and Adam Sandler.",Joe Dirt

This movie received almost entirely negative reviews when it first came out, but now there is nothing but positive reviews.It seems that most people that saw this when it first came out were expecting something closer to Tommyboy or Blacksheep, with David Spade portraying a sarcastic sidekick with little more to offer than the occasional zinger. Instead we have a great tale of an average Joe that makes keeps a positive attitude even though he is constantly thrown into hilarious (for us) situations.Whats the deal?

And while all that is going on, you also get treated to a few pretty funny scenes.Now unlike many others, i have always thought that David Spades was a good comedy actor, (i especially enjoyed his movies with Chris Farley) and that feeling was only enforced after watching this.Also i have to say that Brittany Daniel is a great addition, perhaps not the best actress in the world, but she sure pulled off that role just as it was intended, very pretty girl.So in short, this is a complete no brainer comedy, which manages to add some dept and emotion into a pretty decent plot.Definitely worth recommending",Joe Dirt
121,Heater-2,My comments are positive towards the film.,10,10 April 2001,"I went into this movie a bit skeptical...especially after seeing that trailer showing David Spade setting off a nuclear bomb.  I was expecting a pretty lame movie(the trailer sure was).  Let me tell you, I was very torn about whether or not to see this movie last night.  I had to choose between hanging out with a hot chick or going to see this movie(the girl wouldn't come with).  I am glad I chose the movie. The movie was extremely funny and witty.  Actually, I think that the portrayal of Joe Dirt as white trash was excellent too...the author(s) either really outdid themselves researching white trash or they have a little white trash in their blood.  The blatant yet subtle details in this movie really made it.  I am planning on going to see it again.  David Spade was hilarious...as usual.  Christopher Walken was an awesome character to have floating around as well.  The soundtrack for the movie is nothing less than excellent.  The only complaint I have about the movie is it seemed like it moved too fast.  Pretty weak complaint huh.?.?  If you are looking for a fun way to spend a couple hours, I highly recommend ""Joe Dirt""!",Joe Dirt
122,owlny,Much better than I had expected,7,4 April 2001,"Going into this film, I expected another quirky David Spade movie and was truly not sure if I wanted to sit through it.  After watching it, I was impressed that it showed good character development, and more of a plot line than many of the recent SNL spin-off movies.  Dennis Miller really held this one together, with his interludes from time to time, and witty humor inserted into the story of Joe's adventures.  While I'm not sure if this would be my number one pick of the movies out at the current time, it really isn't all that bad.",Joe Dirt
123,Jpeger,"Ya' Gotta Keep on Keepin' on... Life is a garden, Dig it!",8,8 February 2003,"Surprisingly one of my favorite movies of all time.  Joe Dirt is the story of a white-trash loser that never loses his positive outlook.This movie has everything... Comedy, Drama, Mystery, Romance, Action, and GREAT music.  David Spade and Fred Wolf did a brilliant job putting this film together.Abandoned in youth by his parents at the Grand Canyon, We flashback in time with Joe in his search for his parents while he tells the story to Los Angeles morning DJ, Zander Kelly (wonderfully played by Dennis Miller).",Joe Dirt
124,mekon-3,The worst film I have seen in a LONG time....,1,9 November 2001,"I gather this film is a spin-off from Saturday Night Live which we don't see in England. If this is the standard of comedy currently coming from that programme then someone should drown this puppy PDQ.Joe Dirt has not got a single funny scene in it. It is boring, predictable and cruel (without being funny). The film is fractured into various ideas that the script writers dreamt up for Joe to achieve his aims and put together in a pointless, haphazard way. The film cannot decide whether Joe Dirt is a hero or an object of ridicule. There are no redeeming features whatsoever.Do not see this film.Saturday Night Live, try harder... much harder.",Joe Dirt
125,biggles981,Also better than expected,7,14 December 2001,"I just watched the DVD of this, and I thought I would be a silly, dumb movie, and I was right, but a good silly dumb movie.  After I watched it again for the second time in the same night with Spade's commentary, I wish they had made it an R film, so that many more of the jokes could be heard in it's full glory.  Also, maybe more shots of Brittany Daniel (absolute doll) and Jaime Pressley would be allowed.  Maybe this should be a directors cut of the movie, putting the jokes back where they should be, get rid of the leanings toward teens with the jokes, and go back more to the script.*spoiler*By the way, if you read this David - Revealing the bomb in the car was better at the end of the scene.My four or five cents (i.e. more than you cared to hear).",Joe Dirt
126,WOPKistner,Simply a simple waste of time,1,11 April 2001,"Adam Sandler produced it - that should be a warning. The script tries to recycle plotlines, gags and other things from other, better movies. The actors behave as if they were insane and seduced by drugs at the same time. This ""dirty"" comedy is aseptic, it's awful, it's stupid, but it's not funny at all. Just a waste of time.",Joe Dirt
127,TIMNLR,A touching yet funny story about man trying to find his parents.,6,11 April 2001,"In Joe Dirt David Spade is the funniest I have seen him in a solo project. Christopher Walken did a good job for not being a comic actor. Britney Daniel and Jamie Pressly, need I say more. ALL IN ALL JOE DIRT is worth a trip to the movies.",Joe Dirt
128,MadScientistMatt,"Like a roller coaster, it has ups, downs, and parts that make you want to vomit.",4,5 April 2001,"This movie is somewhat like Forrest Gump meets There's Something About Mary when it comes to its overall theme: Lots of gross humor and a sympathetic hero who doesn't quite seem to be running on all his cylinders but maintains a cheerful, optimistic attitude anyway. David Spade does a fairly convincing job at this role. This movie is also peppered with memorable characters, even if most of them appear only for a few minutes on-screen.The movie is told through various segments and flashbacks, which often appear to be something of a mixed bag.  Some of the early parts especially tend to fall flat, particularly a few with special effects out of a B-movie, but they definitely get better as they go along.As a car enthusiast, I can't leave out the numerous unusual cars in this movie. Joe's beat up Dodge Charger Daytona is played by a Charger which is definitely in better shape than the movie would lead you to believe, but the props department still managed to make it look like a quintessential white trash mobile. Whoever came up with the idea of sticking a chain link steering wheel on it might want to go into hiding, though, as there are quite a few Mopar fans who might want to kill him for that touch. Other noteworthy muscle cars in the movie, nearly all of which are in much better shape, include a dark orange Hemi Road Runner convertible, a late 70's Trans Am, and a gorgeous mid 60's Impala convertible. It's not worth the full price of admission if you want to see it only for the cars, but muscle car fans might want to consider renting it when it comes out on video or taking a look at it in the discount theater, even if you don't care about the plot.Although sometimes it seems like this movie is trying to be Forrest Gump with a mullet, it falls a bit short of that goal. The gross humor doesn't have anything that quite matches the ""hair gel"" scene, but some of it comes close. It's not really a bad movie. But it's not really a must see, either.",Joe Dirt
129,thespider,Pretty Funny,7,21 September 2001,"I didn't hear much about this movie after it came out, but I caught it on DVD. Its actually pretty funny. Dennis Miller is the narrator through out Joe's story. Christopher Walken's apperance add a lot to the movie. Listen to when he tells Joe about his past, hilarious. I would recommend renting it to get some laughs.",Joe Dirt
130,roya_butler,Pure Rock!!,10,10 April 2001,"This movie is PURE ROCK!!! Finally a movie worth seeing! F*%&* the 70s-it's so played out, I'm tired and bored. 80s style is due for a comeback! This flick is funny, and refreshing-no sissy whining in this flick!One of the funniest parts of the movie was when Joe Dirt tries to decipher the ramblings of a Louisiana Man: Homeboy's make it, Homo's Fake it, Homeless & Naked-but it turns out to be: Home is where you make it. What inspirational advice-advice Joe doesn't fully appreciate until the end of the movie.",Joe Dirt
131,lspagnuolo,This movie is GREAT!!!!!,10,16 April 2001,"Normally I find David Spade movies a little boring, however Joe Dirt was the funnest movie I've seen in years. Given, its plot was silly and the crtics said not to see it, I was belly laughing through whole thing. I never give advice on what movie to see, but see Joe Dirt. I can't guarantee that you'll love it, but give it a try you shuold give at least one laugh.",Joe Dirt
132,coche14,Previews don't do this movie justice.,8,22 April 2001,"When I saw the previews and commercials for Joe Dirt, I thought it was going to be a bad movie, but in all honesty, it was a really funny movie. Additionally, it wasn't just stupid humor, there was actual substance to the humor.  All in all, I thought it was a very good movie.",Joe Dirt
133,Kdogownz,One of the best comedies I have ever seen...,10,23 January 2007,"Joe Dirt, played perfectly by David Spade, has to be one of the best comedies I have seen in the last 20 years. While the plot may be far-fetched, the movie does stick to it and is set up perfectly.Alongside Spade, Dennis Miller's cheap jabs at Dirt are absolutely priceless. His encounter with Miller sets up the whole premise for the movie, and the story begins. It takes you through different experiences Dirt has had from the time he lost his parents at the Grand Canyon all the way to the present.Christopher Walker also makes a great appearance in the movie.If you like movies such as Dodgeball, Old School, Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, etc... you will love this one. You have to judge this movie on what it is aimed to do, and that is tell a story of perseverance from Dirt, who gets picked on throughout life and keeps a good attitude, which is a welcomed message. And first and foremost, the movie is made to keep you smiling throughout, and for that it accomplished the goal to perfection. 10/10",Joe Dirt
134,BigJoel,What do you expect?,10,30 April 2001,"If you go to see a movie by any of the Saturday Night Live alumni, be it David Spade, Adam Sandler or Rob Schneider, you cannot expect to see high brow comedy.  Expect light hearted, good natured, somewhat adult oriented fare for a PG-13, and you won't be disappointed.  Joe Dirt delivers this and, surprisingly, more.Plenty of laughs to go with an occasional tug at the heart.  Is there anyone who cannot identify with the irrepressible underdog Joe, as he works his way through life?  I was pleasantly surprised at this film.  Much better than his 1999 effort Lost & Found, Spade manages to be more genuine in his Dirt persona than expected.  The supporting cast is what you would expect for a film of this level, slightly more than adequate.If you go see this movie, don't expect to be bowled over by an intellectual comedy classic, just expect to laugh and have a good time.  Leave your pretenses at the door.JS",Joe Dirt
135,Horizontally Sideways,Better than Predicted,6,2 May 2001,"This film is much much better than I predicted it would be. This is the first thing I said to my friends after watching the movie, there were also alot of ""dude, that was awesome""s. I expected this movie to a stereotypical Farley/Spade Tommy Boy style movie, but it wasn't just that. Although it incorperated some of that same humor, it also threw in an incredible storyline, and a handful of well defined characters. I also enjoyed the use of characters from former SNL star's movies. This movie kept me deeply interested and not wanting to leave my seat. This movie should definently not be overlooked, even if your not a huge Spade fan, you still need to see this movie.",Joe Dirt
136,srdomer,David Spade's best to date...,10,27 September 2001,"A surprisingly entertaining film!  I don't consider myself a David Spade fan by a long shot, but he did a great job in the lead role of this film, and carried the film successfully.  Perhaps the patheticness of his character (Joe Dirt), and Joe's acceptance of this made him actually bearable for a change.  The film moves along quickly and smartly.  It was kinda like a cross between David Copperfield (the Dicken's novel, not the lame-ass magician) and Pee Wee Herman's Great Adventure.  I found it light, but still somewhat uplifting.  And good comedy writing - plenty of hilarious gags. The unusual cast choices (Christopher Walken, Kid Rock and Fred Ward to name a few) added to the film's quirkyness.  And the music (late Seventy's rock) also contributed to my overall enjoyment of the film.  My only negative criticism would be the weak, romantic sub-plot with Joe and Brandy, with the two becoming separated and Joe thinking he's been spurned by his one true love.  But, of course, everything comes up 'Dirt' in the end, as you would expect for this kind of light comedy.  Still, mostly creative and very enjoyable.  Not a surprise that it appears to rent well at my local video store, where dogs like 'The Mexican' are stacked up like unwanted children. Nothing terribly obscene here, so you can prob even let your kids (10 and up) stay up and watch it.",Joe Dirt
137,kshmny,Steaming Pile of Crap,1,29 September 2001,"This steaming pile of crap wasted, not only 45 minutes of my life, but countless dollars which could have been used to feed the needy.  The movie has no distinguishable plot line, really bad acting and jokes that went nowhere.Not only should rednecks and white trash be offended by this movie, but anyone with a smidgen of good taste and humor.  I returned the DVD to the rental store within 50 minutes of renting the movie, along with a warning to any and all who would listen to stay far, far away from the movie.  The only redeeming value is that it did include Christopher Walken ( a great and hilarious actor), and that for every DVD made there is one less Backstreet Boys album to pollute the airwaves.David Spade should be ecstatic because his career can only go up from this point.",Joe Dirt
138,stephen-lalli,The Ish!!!,9,23 January 2007,"I usually hold myself to a high movie standard. I usually would not consider a movie like Joe Dirt the ""cream of the crop."" But like many other times in my life I was wrong. Joe Dirt is a fantastic heart-felt flick staring David Spade as a pathetic white trash orphan in search of his parents. He meets many a folk along the way leaving an impression with them all. I saw this in the theater and thought, ""wow what a funny movie."" But then I caught in on Comedy Central a few years later and lo and behold I was hooked. Good plot, great humor, hot chicks, and even Kid Rock playing his white trash nemesis (it was a real stretch for him :P). If you see this movie for 10 bucks at Walmart or Blockbuster do yourself a favor and buy it. It will keep you company on even your darkest nights.Life's a garden, DIG IT!!!",Joe Dirt
139,moba2k,Inspired me!,9,12 September 2003,"Joe Dirt's story, just like the audience in the movie, had inspired me. It may sound corny and I could care less about what negative things you have to say about that, but I'm not ashamed to admit that I really liked the movie. And the movie through its humor has a very positive message for a world filled with critics and negativities and ill-wishers.",Joe Dirt

If you don't agree, I'm sorry that you can't see the humor, but remember...Life's a garden dig it.  And keep on keepin' on.",Joe Dirt
142,mitsueclipse077,This harebrained comedy will throw you out of your seat!,8,20 July 2004,"This sophomoric comedy presents all which it should  immaturely styled jokes, crude sense of humor. Performances are outstanding! David Spade isn't his clever and witty self in this one. Anticipate familiar styles from crew such as Christopher Walken and Brittany Daniel. If you enjoy the Adam Sandler films, don't let yourself miss this one! Those who enjoy the sophisticated, and thinking types of humor  expect to find yourself deeply dissatisfied or possibly enjoying something entirely different. If you already own, or happen to purchase the DVD, listening to the audio commentary from Spade and the director Dennie Gordon throughout the film is highly recommended! You'll definitely learn to have a deeper appreciation for the film, for instance it's very low budget really changes the situation.",Joe Dirt
143,KathySmith-1,A well told story.,10,9 February 2005,"Oh David Spade...yet again what you touch turns to gold. Joe Dirt is a well told story with more then it's share of laughs. It shows the good side of people as well as the ugly side in the way different characters treat the underdog Joe Dirt thru his life and adventures. Adults can enjoy every moment of the movie as well as kids, with some of the jokes going over their heads (I'm yer sister! I'm yer sister!). This is one movie that our family has watched over and over again and it never gets old. The musical score of the movie is exceptional! The music goes hand in hand with the movie scenes and while the movie itself needed no improvement, the music perfected the movie like good wine perfects a good steak. Takes it from a 9 to a 10 in my opinion. Believe it or not, this comedy will actually touch your heart and if you were not rooting for Joe Dirt in the beginning, you'll be rooting for him by the end.",Joe Dirt
144,abacus30,you people are too serious,8,20 March 2005,"I've read a few reviews of this movie and I'm astounded by all the negative spew that comes out of people for such a hilarious movie. I got a clue for some of you, lots of movies are made without the need to get an Oscar, have some hidden meaning or be artsy fartsy for critics. This movie was made for laughs and it accomplishes that fully, as long as you're not offended by a little raunch or immaturity. If you are offended, maybe you should come see me as I'm a professional counselor by trade and believe you're taking life way too seriously!! I find Joe Dirt to be a classic comedy in my collection. All my friends love it and find it delightfully sentimental too (added bonus, not necessary). I have no doubt this is David Spade's best and I thoroughly appreciated the introduction to Brittany Daniel (Joe Dirt's love)... man she's unbelievably hot!!! Anyway, this movie wasn't meant to be any movie masterpiece. It was supposed to be funny. I couldn't stop laughing all the way through it and it just gets better and better the more times you watch it.",Joe Dirt

I love this movie so much that I look for everyday opportunities to drop movie lines into regular conversation. Phrases like, "" No man, I'm cool.""{Joe} replied with ""No your not""{Robbie} continues to floor me to this day. I also enjoy watching this movie with the special feature commentary from David Spade again and again. The hair, the car, the poo, the girl, Kickin Wing, Buffalo Bob: ""It puts the lotion on the skin!, it does what it's told!"" has me laughing in my sleep. I have rewound the carnival scene with G. Thorogood's ""Who do you love"" to the point of wearing out the reverse button. My favorite scene is the shortest scene in the whole movie, when he's hitchhiking and holding that sign (oh my goodness that hysterical with the green stonewashed jeans), the space peanut.... oh i could go on and on, but I have to go watch the movie again....

I was a tourist in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina hit and i watched this film in my hotel room just hours before the hurricane hit. It's humour and the lovable nature of the lead character really helped us to forget about what was coming.The hell that followed the hurricane itself, as part of a party of internationals who were under considerable threat of attack from the locals, was occasionally tempered by remembering funny bits from the film. It may sound a little corny but this film really did help me get through that terrible time. It is very funny-even if you're not about to face a hurricane!",Joe Dirt
